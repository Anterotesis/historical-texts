         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THIS excellent Book,</hi> The Fulfilling of the Scriptures, <hi>has long been a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Piece, and much read in a great Part of the Proteſtant World; as to ſhould ſeem by the numerous Editions of it, in various Countries. It found ſuch Entertainment at its firſt Publication, that quickly there was a new Impreſſion</hi> [Anno 1671.] <hi>When the</hi> Author <hi>revis'd his Work, and made conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Enlargements in the Body of it (conſtantly diſtinguiſhing thoſe</hi> Additions, <hi>with this Mark both before and after) and further added an</hi> Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, <hi>to lead us into ſome practical Reflections, and proper Uſes of the whole.—It's from this Edition, with ſuch Alterations and Improvements, that the preſent Impreſſion is done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Being deſired to reviſe the Copy, before it went to the Preſs, I found a Multitude of typographical</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata, <hi>which according to my beſt Skill I endeavour'd to amend; tho' upon a Review I obſerve, ſome leſſer Miſtakes have eſcaped the Printer's or my Correction, eſpecially in the Pointing, which ſeems a little to cloud the Senſe in ſeveral Places: but ſuch Care has been us'd, that I hope no very great Errors have been committed in this Impreſſion.</hi>

               <hi>In ſome Inſtances, with Regard to the</hi> Diction, <hi>I have preſumed to uſe the like Liberty, as the late Rev. Mr.</hi> DANIEL BURGESS, <hi>in republiſhing another valuable Performance of the ſame Author, has done before me. Beſides the Authority of his Example, I have this Apology to make in his Words. "No</hi> Lion <hi>found I in my Way: but a ſorry</hi> Worm <hi>I counted the Exclamation of ſome nice Folk, againſt the</hi> Phraſe <hi>and</hi> Style <hi>of this confeſſedly excellent Work. Dutifully I compaſſionated the</hi> weak; <hi>and no leſs the many</hi> ſick, <hi>of Curioſity: Who have ſuch Ulcers in their Palates, that they cannot, without</hi> cruel Pain, <hi>ſwallow the moſt deſirable Dainties, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they may take them in</hi> Oil <hi>and</hi> Sugar; <hi>cannot prevail with themſelves to read Periods that require</hi> an attentive Mind, <hi>and the leaſt</hi> Strain <hi>of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Wherefore I uſed my Spunge, and took out as many Expreſſions of my</hi> Author's native Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>that I thought would diſturb an Engliſh Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; ſubſtituting ſuch as appear'd ſufficiently intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible." But where important Matters of</hi> Fact <hi>are related, I have thought it beſt to leave the Language altogether untouched.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The firſt and other Editions of the preſent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe were</hi> anonymous: <hi>But I have taken the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to prefix the reputed Writer's</hi> Name <hi>to this: Tho' not ſo much upon the Credit of Tradition and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame, as of an expreſs Teſtimony, the ſaid Mr.</hi> BURGESS <hi>has left us of the Fact; who having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the</hi> Author (<hi>about the Year</hi> 1693) <hi>correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, then living in</hi> Holland, <hi>and drew him out of his affected Secrecy.

And truly about that, this grave convincing argument of the <hi>Scripture</hi>'s certain <hi>Accompliſhment,</hi> hath not only oft ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him in the face, with a ſatisfying <hi>diſcovery</hi> and <hi>impreſſion</hi> thereof, as a moſt quieting and unanſweroble demonſtration of the truth; but

            </p>
            <p>It is a <hi>dark</hi> time now with the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt; which we ſee every where almoſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and afflicted, whilſt the whole earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſeemeth to be at eaſe; Chriſtians alſo even beyond others in their <hi>private</hi> lot, aſſaulted with very ſharp trials; though, I think, <hi>ſuffering</hi> may be the leaſt of our fear at this day, while <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> doth now appear on ſo formidable a growth, and hath a more threatning aſpect, than the rage or violence of men. We ſee a ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay likewiſe on the Churches <hi>abroad;</hi> Religion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where under a great conſumption, &amp; wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, that ſeemeth to have reached it in its vital parts: Men ſearch after an unuſual way of ſinning, as if they ſcorned to be wicked at a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary rate; prejudice eaſily taken up and entertained againſt the way of God; whilſt the <hi>good man doth</hi> (alas!) <hi>periſh,</hi> without any affecting obſervation thereof; the choice and excellent of the earth pluckt away, and none to fill their room; Chriſtians burials now fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, but the birth and in-bringing of ſuch to the Church, rare. This is indeed a ſad ſubject, and ſo much the ſadder, that few are ſound <hi>whoſe eye affecteth their heart,</hi> whoſe tears and groaning ſeem to anſwer ſuch a ſtroke and ruin which now is like to fall under our hand: but
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:005185_0013_1016D8FE32FADB88"/>
I ſhall leave this. <hi>Prayer</hi> will be the beſt cure, and is this day more fit, than complaining, to <hi>turn unto him,</hi> who <hi>ſeeth the ways of his People, that he may heal them,</hi> and can <hi>prevent thoſe with mercy,</hi> who ſeem leaſt fit for the ſame.—Only two or three ſad remarks of this time, I cannot altogether paſs; which indeed are ſtrange ſymptoms of the Church's preſent caſe and diſtemper.—(1.) To ſee men own the <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> of <hi>ſanctification,</hi> who yet can profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſown, yea, make it their work by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to beget a prejudice againſt the <hi>practice</hi> thereof. On ſtrange! to find ſuch as will dip their pen in gall againſt a tender and ſtrict walk in Religion, and revile it in the power thereof; whilſt they do not deny thoſe truths, &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that neceſſarily oblige to ſuch a tender prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; who, in the moſt grave concerning duties of Chriſtianity, think it enough to charge their brethren with <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Oſtentation, and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, whilſt they muſt confeſs theſe duties to be unqueſtionably binding; and that they can be no competent judges of ſuch a challenge, which the great witneſs of the heart &amp; in ward parts of of men can only determine. (2.) It is a ſad remark alſo of the time, that <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the reform'd Religion, ſhall ſtate themſelves in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the moſt concerning grounds thereof, ſuch as <hi>imputed righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by faith,</hi> which is well called <hi>Articulus ſtantis et cadentis Eccleſiae.</hi> I cannot have that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that it is from <hi>ignorance,</hi> but from a height of <hi>malice,</hi> that ſome of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="xv" facs="unknown:005185_0014_1016D9460EEE8A50"/>
as if it preſſed believing and reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt <hi>without reſpect</hi> to works and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I confeſs, we put not <hi>inherent</hi> righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the room of <hi>imputed;</hi> though we aſſert <hi>each</hi> is <hi>neceſſary</hi> in their own <hi>place,</hi> the one in order to our <hi>right,</hi> the other in order to our actual and full <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of that right, yea, that <hi>holineſs</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary, not only <hi>neceſſitate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti, ſed medii;</hi> and juſtifying <hi>faith</hi> doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily require works, <hi>ſed non qua, et quatenus juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificat.</hi> But ſure, if theſe men grant that we are juſtified by the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, they muſt needs confeſs it is by imputation; ſince if the <hi>deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> be acquitted by the <hi>Cautioners</hi> payment, is it not by the <hi>Imputation</hi> thereof to him? O ſad! to ſee ſome put their invention upon the rack how to wound the Church (yea, a death-wound it would be, if they could reach their end) in that great truth of <hi>imputed righteouſneſs!</hi> But it were beſt they deny'd that 6<hi>th ver.</hi> of the 4. <hi>Ch.</hi> to the the <hi>Rom.</hi> to be canonial Scripture, which none can read, and ſhift; it being ſo clear, that the <hi>bleſſed man</hi> is there held forth, <hi>unto whom God imputeth righteouſneſs without works.</hi> Sure that cannot be inherent righteouſneſs, elſe it were <hi>contradictio in adjecto.</hi> I profeſs, thoſe (what ever they pretend) I muſt look on as <hi>adverſaries</hi> to the <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches; and there is nothing more dangerous than a pirat going forth under a counterfit flag.—(3.) Is it not likewiſe ſad, yea, aſtoniſhing to ſee, <hi>Miniſters</hi> now in theſe times, who are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Embaſſadors of Chriſt</hi> given to the Church for her <hi>edification,</hi> ſtand ſo directly <hi>croſs</hi> to the very <hi>end</hi> of their work &amp; Miniſtry; many, of whom it
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:005185_0015_1016D9001A962700"/>
may be ſaid, that knowingly &amp; deliberately they <hi>oppoſe</hi> piety! That ſuch ſhould <hi>perſecute,</hi> whoſe work is to <hi>feed;</hi> ſhould <hi>wound,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>healing; grieve the ſpirit</hi> of the Godly, who ſhould be <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of their joy!</hi> that none are a greater plague, to <hi>corrupt</hi> the Church, and cauſe the ſacrifices of the Lord to be abhorred, than ſome of thoſe who ſhould be <hi>the ſalt of the earth!</hi> yea, none more <hi>obſtruct the treaty of the Goſpel,</hi> betwixt Chriſt and his Church, than Miniſters who are called the <hi>friends of the bridegroom!</hi> Oh what a ſtrange and aſtoniſhing contradiction may this ſeem! But it ſhould be no reproach to that holy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>calling</hi> of the Miniſtry; for of ſuch the Scripture hath expreſly warned. I confeſs, it may be ſaid, <hi>No Atheiſt</hi> like an <hi>unſanctified Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter;</hi> yea, no Atheiſm of ſo black a die as theirs, who being ſtill employed about <hi>holy things,</hi> have yet no <hi>ſenſe</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>Now in this very dark hour, wherein the Church ſeemeth to have fallen into a <hi>death like</hi> pang, and oh many of her Children in a ſad le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy) that if we looked in an ordinary way, <hi>her wound</hi> might ſeem <hi>incureable,</hi> there are two great and concerning <hi>Quaeries,</hi> that I think ſhould much take us up. The <hi>one</hi> is, to know <hi>what the Scripture ſpeaketh to the Church; what ſolid ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is there held forth?</hi> For truly, if we had not that ſure teſtimony of the <hi>Word,</hi> we might fear, Religion would quite wear out, and <hi>Truth periſh from the earth:</hi> but doth the Scripture <hi>ſpeak peace?</hi> all then is well. <hi>That (O that)</hi> is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſecurity, to put the Church's hope beyond further debate; tho' men ſhould threaten, tho' the earth were overturned, &amp; the foundation ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken!
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:005185_0016_1016D947BAAB9F70"/>
This is a determination, above men, above all the rules of humane policy, yea, above the ſtars, <hi>which fruſtrateth the tokens of the liars,</hi> and <hi>maketh diviners mad;</hi> even that revealed <hi>Counſel of God,</hi> taking place about his work and People.</p>
            <p>I know, ſome grave writers of theſe late times do expreſs their fear, that the horrid wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and apoſtacy of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Church may at laſt reſolve in the Lord's departure, and an <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal darkneſs;</hi> that as the rejection of the <hi>Jews</hi> made way for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> incoming, ſo their fall may as remarkably preceed that ſolemn return and reſtauration of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church; it is alſo become the fear of many, that <hi>Popery</hi> may yet once overrun the whole Reformed Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Antichriſt's fall. But ſince theſe ſad tho'ts nor any appearance of the time, are no part of our <hi>Bible,</hi> we ſhould learn neither to ſtretch our fears, nor expectations, beyond that which the <hi>Scripture</hi> warranteth: and if the Lord be God, and this his very word, let us adhere to it, and wait for its accompliſhment.—A <hi>ſecond Quere,</hi> which is indeed no leſs concerning in ſuch a time, may be about <hi>Duty:</hi> What do ſo eminent an <hi>hazard of the Church,</hi> and this great <hi>decay of Chriſtianity,</hi> moſt preſſingly <hi>call for?</hi> But this is a ſubject which requireth another pen, and too large, to touch with a paſſing word: yea, we may ſay, the <hi>great want</hi> of theſe days is not about the <hi>diſcovery</hi> of duty, but of the <hi>practice</hi> of known, and diſcovered duties. For the <hi>Scripture</hi> giveth a <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>diſtinct found,</hi> in the darkeſt time; and hath not left us to doubtful enquiries, and debate in this matter. I ſhall therefore leave

it, with a few things only to be in the general conſidered. (1.) It is ſure, that <hi>every time</hi> hath its preſent <hi>duty;</hi> and the wiſe <hi>diſcerners</hi> thereof will know thence <hi>what they ought to do,</hi> what work and ſervice the preſent circumſtances of that time call for. Shall the earth have its <hi>ſeaſons,</hi> wherein things are <hi>beautiful?</hi> ſhall the <hi>ſtork</hi> and <hi>ſwallow know their time?</hi> and yet <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not know how to <hi>bring forth fruit in their ſeaſon,</hi> and diſcern the ſpecial time and opportunity of duty! (2.) It is alſo ſure, that <hi>every Chriſtian,</hi> in what ſoever capacity or condition, as he hath his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and talent, ſo hath ſome <hi>work,</hi> and <hi>oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> of duty; wherein they may <hi>ſerve the Lord in their generation:</hi> yea, it is not the meaneſt lot or condition, that ſhutteth that door upon any, that they have no work for God, who deſire to be faithful for him. O that in this <hi>threatning time,</hi> when darkneſs is like to overſpread the Church, it were more <hi>upon the hearts of Chriſtians,</hi> to ſtrive together, and contend by a ſerious improvement of their ſeveral capacities, to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Religion,</hi> and tranſmit the knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to the poſterity; that the Chriſtian parent, or Maſter of family, did witneſs more that great reſolution, in a time when many are draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, <hi>But as for me, I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord!</hi>—(3.) It is found, that the moſt <hi>eminent</hi> and <hi>honourable ſervice</hi> of the Church doth uſually <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal</hi> her in a <hi>low</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> condition. When there hath been but <hi>little ſtrength,</hi> &amp; many outward diſadvantages, then both their <hi>call</hi> and <hi>furniture</hi> hath been moſt obſervable, to confeſs the truth, to endure for the Goſpel of Chriſt, to <hi>overcome</hi>
               <pb n="xix" facs="unknown:005185_0018_1016D94E3146E228"/>
               <hi>by the Word of his teſtimony;</hi> a piece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, whereto more proſperous times do not give ſuch an opportunity. Yea, it hath been in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 32. that <hi>thoſe who knew their God, were made ſtrong to do exploits.</hi>—(4.) It doth much concern us, to put a <hi>high value</hi> on the <hi>truth,</hi> in a time when men muſt either <hi>loſe</hi> it, or <hi>buy</hi> it. And O! what a choice purchaſe is that, which cannot be bought too dear, tho' at the rate of our liberty, eſtate, credit and reputation, yea, with the loſs of peace, when it cometh in competition with it? For it is that great <hi>depoſitum, once delivered to the Saints,</hi> the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of our Children, that way whereby Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt keepeth intercourſe with his Bride on the earth, yea, the charter of all our mercies, and of our hope through eternity.—(5.) Tho' eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty line of divine truth is ineſtimble; yet it is ſure, there is a <hi>more preſſing call</hi> for our adherence to <hi>that truth,</hi> which is moſt <hi>controverted</hi> in the time. For it is <hi>the word of his patience,</hi> and the matter of <hi>our preſent teſtimony:</hi> and it is known through all ages, what a ſingular <hi>bleſſing</hi> hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>contending</hi> and <hi>witneſſing</hi> of a few for the <hi>truth</hi> (in a torrent of publick <hi>defection</hi>) to keep it <hi>alive,</hi> when it was like to be ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; yea, to effects above rational belief; <hi>unus Athanaſius contra totum orbem!</hi> Many ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks have not been wanting.—(6.) I ſhall only add, that which is <hi>always</hi> neceſſary and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, yet we may ſay in a time of the Church's <hi>hazard</hi> and <hi>ſuffering</hi> is more preſſingly called for, even <hi>the ſtudy of Chriſtian</hi> PRUDENCE; a duty convincingly neceſſary, for <hi>regulating</hi> of duties,
<pb n="xx" facs="unknown:005185_0019_1016D906570A50C0"/>
according to the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>'s caſe: which doth ſo nearly concern the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and preſervation of <hi>Religion,</hi> that I muſt ſay, <hi>A breach in that</hi> Concord <hi>betwixt</hi> ZEAL <hi>and Chriſtian</hi> PRUDENCE, <hi>when there is not ſome</hi> equal reſpect <hi>ſtudyed in the exerciſe of</hi> both, <hi>cannot but give the Church a ſore</hi> WOUND. This is indeed a large theme; but I ſhall only point at in three things. 1. In our avoiding and being tender to <hi>give offence;</hi> not only to keep a diſtance from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but from the ſmalleſt <hi>appearance</hi> thereof. I muſt ſay, they are bad caſuiſts, and have little reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the Churches edification, who make it their work, not ſo much to keep men from ſin, as to ſhew them, <hi>quam prope ad peccatum ſine peccato accedere liceat.</hi> O what a becoming fear is that, <hi>not to lay a ſtumbling block</hi> in the way of others, to grieve the weak, or confirm ſuch who uſe to found their prejudice againſt the truth and way of God, upon the miſcarriage of ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the ſame. 2. This excellent ſtudy of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian <hi>Prudence</hi> hath a reſpect to men's <hi>taking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> as well as their giving it; to our being <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> in judging, in <hi>perſonal</hi> reflections, to cover and hide the infirmities of others, rather than ſpread them, even for the Goſpel's ſake; yea, to ſhut as it were our eyes, and caſt a mantle on their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who tho' overtaken with the violence of ſome temptation may yet be ſerviceable to the Church; but eſpecially this ſhould preſs us to a watchful regard of any <hi>breach</hi> &amp; <hi>rent in the Church,</hi> and to ſtudy a <hi>healing</hi> ſpirit, ſo far as is poſſible, without prejudice to truth. 3. It is alſo a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing piece of Chriſtian <hi>Prudence,</hi> how to <hi>walk</hi>
               <pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:005185_0020_1016D94FC3CA7968"/>
               <hi>wiſely towards thoſe who are without,</hi> when pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt the way of God is now in ſuch a growth; to ſtudy how we may convince, gain ground, and by Chriſtianly <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> carriage conciliate reſpect to the <hi>truth;</hi> and thus commend <hi>holineſs,</hi> and thoſe who profeſs it, to the conſcience of men; to ſtudy that rule of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency</hi> much in things of themſelves warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, what fitneſs and advantage preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may offer, or deny for edification and promoting that great intereſt of the Goſpel in our converſe with men.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now ceaſe to trouble you further; only would premiſe ſome few things with a reſpect to the <hi>ſubject of this following eſſay.</hi>—(1.) Should we not with <hi>wonder</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſhment</hi> look on this great record of the <hi>Scripture?</hi> by which the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty of God doth ſpeak to men, yea doth as certainly communicate his Counſel and mind, we may ſay more certainly, than if we had an immediate audible voice from Heaven. O could we have ſuch ordinary thoughts of this, if we conſider how near GOD cometh therein to us? I think, if there were but <hi>one corner</hi> of the earth, though in the remoteſt parts, where men might go and get a look of ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and important a thing as <hi>God's expreſs Will</hi> written and ſent from Heaven to the earth, about our duty here, and bleſſedneſs for ever, ſhould we not think it worth our croſſing the ſea, and the greateſt expence of time or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? It is truly a wonder how we can read and conſider the Scripture, without wondring.—(2.) It is a great concernment, to know that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:005185_0021_1016D908060277A8"/>
hath ſuch a <hi>witneſs,</hi> as <hi>Experience!</hi> and that there is ſuch a <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>correſpondence</hi> as this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Saints</hi> and the <hi>Word,</hi> which lieth not in the common road of the World. O what an empty thing would Religion be, if it had not this word <hi>Experience</hi> in its grammar; that ſecret and ſure <hi>mark,</hi> whereby the Chriſtian knoweth the Scripture is <hi>of God;</hi> how thus the Lord hath oft <hi>ſealed their inſtruction</hi> in a dark plunge; how life and power, inlivening influences, to the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their heart, have oft met them therein a very dead frame; and now they know that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <hi>God heareth prayer:</hi> now they are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and have learned by the croſs, that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>Comforter;</hi> yea, many can ſhew how by the Word their <hi>firſt acquaintance</hi> with the Lord did begin; how ſome particular truth, like a grain of corn ſown in their heart, by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the great husbandman was made to take life, and grow.—(3.) It much concerneth us, to know what an excellent <hi>key</hi> the Scripture is to unlock that ſealed book of <hi>providence;</hi> and that no other key can fit the ſame; many have tried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way, but loſt themſelves on the ſearch, &amp; the more they attempt by human wiſdom, they became the more dark. I truly think, there is not a more ſatisfying diſcovery within time, than this, <hi>to trace divine truth back</hi> until we ſee its firſt breaking forth out of his eternal <hi>decree</hi> and <hi>council,</hi> who is the author thereof; how thence it taketh hold of the <hi>word,</hi> which is the adequate ſign and declaration of his purpoſe; and then how the <hi>word</hi> taketh hold of his <hi>work</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> where we may ſee the face and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:005185_0022_1016D95158F20068"/>
of the <hi>Church</hi> clearly written out through all the changes of time; how <hi>providence</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>ſteady courſe,</hi> even amidſt the moſt perplexed motions &amp; reelings of the earth; yea, how all things, even thoſe which would ſeem moſt contradictory, run within that ſtrait channel of the word, and cannot go without theſe bounds.—(4.) It is the <hi>principal</hi> &amp; <hi>moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Scripture-promiſes,</hi> that are only touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this following diſcourſe, theſe which carry along with them a clear continued ſeries of the Church's condition through time, and ſhew the moſt remarkable changes of her lot. For it is clear, that in <hi>diverſe</hi> prophecies and in a <hi>different</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Spirit doth point at <hi>one</hi> &amp; the <hi>ſame thing:</hi> and truly it ſhould cauſe no miſtake or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that we find ſeveral of the <hi>Scripture-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> expreſt in ſuch <hi>dark</hi> terms, ſince the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God ſaw it fit that for a time theſe truths ſhould be locked up and ſealed. But now <hi>light</hi> hath ſo far broken forth with the <hi>event,</hi> as we may ſee how very ſignificant and ſuitable to the matter theſe moſt dark aenigmatick terms are.—(5.) We ſhould upon no account <hi>ſhut our ears,</hi> where the <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>clear,</hi> and giveth us ground to hope that the <hi>outgoing of the Lord,</hi> for his people in their deliveranee, &amp; for the deſtruction of his enemies, now in theſe <hi>laſt times,</hi> ſhall be <hi>very glorious;</hi> yea, by ſome ſtately &amp; ſtupendious acts of providence, that he ſhall accompliſh his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> neither muſt we take a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice at <hi>truth,</hi> becauſe of the wilde <hi>Fancies</hi> of many who would extend it beyond its bounds, or that near <hi>Reſemblance</hi> which the <hi>Error</hi> of ſome in
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:005185_0023_1016D9099FAD5C18"/>
this time may ſeem to have thereto. For that hath been an old ſtratagem of the <hi>Devil,</hi> to <hi>prejudice</hi> the World at ſome of the <hi>truths</hi> of God, by ſetting up a <hi>counterfeit</hi> thereto. I ſhall add no more, only what account is given, upon the cloſe of the laſt argument, of ſome <hi>remarkable paſſages</hi> of providence in the <hi>late</hi> times, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Author hath ſome confidence to profeſs, he did endeavour what could be attained for <hi>certainty</hi> of the ſame, and if any circumſtances of theſe relations ſhould be found a miſtake, he dare ſay before Him who is greater than our conſcience, it was not the neglect of ſerious inquiry; ſo he muſt alſo premiſe, the inſerting of them was upon no further intent, than to be a <hi>witneſs</hi> to that truth of <hi>the Lord's eminent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance for his Church in the laſt days.</hi> It would be of great uſe and profit to the Church, that ſome more fitly qualified would ſtudy a more <hi>large Collection</hi> of this kind. O that this might go forth with a <hi>bleſſing</hi> from Him, who by the meaneſt things can ſerve himſelf, and promote the edification of his Church; and that the Lord would <hi>raiſe</hi> ſome up with much of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> to make a further ſearch and enquiry into this great and weighty truth.</p>

            <p>THERE are two Means by which the bleſſed Majeſty of GOD hath choſen to reveal himſelf to the ſons of men, his WORD and his WORKS: which may be called the two great Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, for giving Light to the Church, though the one be greater, I mean doth more clearly ſhine forth, yea, doth communicate light to the other. Theſe, men muſt not divide, which by ſo ſtrait a tye the Lord hath joined, and by a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous correſpondence hath ſet the one over againſt the other, that it may be eaſy to ſee his faithfulneſs, and the <hi>accompliſhment of the Scripture</hi> therein: and indeed this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

I. That the <hi>Scripture of God hath a certain Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment here in the World,</hi> and what is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the ſame, I ſhall endeavour to clear in theſe things, which would be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is the very unfolding of the Lord's decree, and ſecret purpoſe, the bringing forth of his work, now within time, to the view of Angels and Men, which was before him in the deep of his thoughts, and Counſel from eternity; it is an opening up of the ſealed Book, which we muſt not underſtand to be that ſecret Roll of Election, and the Book of Life, wherein the Names of the Elect are writ; but <hi>Liber fatidicus,</hi> the ſealed Book of God's Diſpenſations in the World, ſhewing out his Counſels, and Deſigns, which ſhould be brought forth in the After-ages of Time: for as the Lord did fully comprehend what he was to do, and all that was to befal his Church, and People from the Beginning to the End, long before there was a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, before the Mountains were formed, ſo hath he copied, and written out his Heart in the Word about the ſame, wherein he hath moſt plainly ſhewed forth, what were his bleſſed Purpoſes, and Counſel of old; and thus the Thoughts of his Heart, his Word and his Works do ſweetly agree, and each one won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully anſwers to another. For his Work doth bring forth, and accompliſh his Word, that his Decree and Counſel from all Eternity may take Place.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scripture's Accompliſhment is the Tranſcript and Writing of it over in Providence: where we may ſee and admire how the Word doth ſhine upon all the Paths and Footſteps of the Lord toward his Church in every Age, and gives Light to the ſame, and what an evident Reflection his Work hath again upon the Word; ſo that through the whole Series and Courſe of Providence in the Earth, we have a moſt exact Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture, and Image of the Scripture, anſwering one to another as Face anſwers to Face in the glaſs, where
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005185_0038_1016D96D1738B7A8"/>
it may be eaſy to diſcern the copy by the principal, and that Reſemblance which is betwixt the Building, and that excellent pattern, and Model, which is held forth thereof in the Word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Accompliſhment of the Scripture is the very turning that, which was the Object of our Faith and Contemplation, to be the Object of our Senſe and Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it is the real Birth, and bringing forth theſe Truths unto the World in their appointed Time and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon concerning the Church, and particular Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which were hid in that Womb of the promiſe, and many dark Predictions of the Word; it is ſuch a Thing as giveth the Promiſes and Prophecies, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Being, yea bringeth Truth ſo near within the Reach of our Senſes, that we may even touch, as it were, and handle the Words of Life. O what an excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter is Experience! <hi>Taſte and ſee:</hi> for thus the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſtian getteth a View of the Scripture, and ſpiritual Things, which the moſt ſubtil, and piercing Eye of unſanctified Schoolmen cannot reach, yea, by the Practice of Truth, Nearneſs to God, and retiring of the Soul to him, hath oft got more Light in an Hour, than others by many Days putting their Judgement and Invention upon the Rack.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is God's own Seal, which he putteth to the Word to confirm and ratify the ſame; I do not only mean that ſecret Seal of the Spirit within, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more external, that ſolemn Teſtimony of his Works, whereby he doth every Day appeal to Men's Conſciences about his Truth: for his Works are very manifeſt, whereon there is ſo clear an ingraving of his Truth and Faithfulneſs, that as the Impreſs and Image of the ſeal is upon the wax, men may alſo ſee whoſe ſuperſcription and image that is, which doth appear on ſuch, and ſuch paſſages of providence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This is ſomething we are not to ſeek only in the extraordinary acts of providence, or in any ſingular
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005185_0039_1016D9252893D910"/>
and eminent path of a Chriſtian's experience; nay, it doth ſhine forth in the ſmalleſt and moſt caſual things that fall out, yea in every Page of that great Volume of Providence may it be clearly read.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Scripture's accompliſhment is ſuch a thing as concerns every Chriſtian in his perſonal caſe; to which his ordinary experience doth relate; whereof ſuch have a large regiſter, what of the Word hath been certainly proved in the ſeveral ſteps and changes of their life, whoſe practice doth much lie betwixt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the Word, and obſervation how it is fulfilled: ſuch can witneſs, how under a ſpiritual decay to be carnally minded is death, and when its well, what great peace they have who love God's Law: they have oft found, that in a ſtrait he is a very preſent help, and in the way of duty that it's ſurely good to draw near to him; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the cloſe of their life, can from many remarkable and convincing providences de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth, and faithfulneſs of God. And truly whilſt I ſpeak here, of the Chriſtian's experience, I think it's ſad, and a great ſhort-coming, that there is not a more ſerious improvement of it for this end: which is a very concerning duty on ſuch who have taſted that the Lord is gracious, and O what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent addition would this be to their will or teſtament, when they are to leave the World, to leave a teſtimony behind them to the faithfulneſs of God in his Word and promiſe, and thus put their ſeal to the ſame, from what they have oft proved by ſure experience! For this ſhould prove a ſingular help to ſtrengthen others, and ſpread abroad the fame and good report of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: yea, thus one generation ſhould declare the works of the Lord to another, and tranſmit the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his goodneſs to ſucceeding ages.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This is ſomething which not only the Chriſtian's experience doth witneſs, and in every time taketh place but hath alſo a peculiar reference to thoſe ages, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005185_0040_1016D9700E779D00"/>
periods of times, wherein ſuch particular truths ſhould have their accompliſhment. For its true, that the Prophets of old did not only in their predictions hold forth in general, the truth and certainty of thoſe things, which ſhould fall out: but they alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired and ſearched diligently about the time; to what or what manner of time the Spirit by them did point. I <hi>Pet.</hi> I. II.—For 'tis truly clear, that a piece of the Word was under the Law to have its peculiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment; that part of it alſo under the Meſſia's Kingdom, in the days of the goſpel ſhould be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and we find a very concerning part thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to theſe latter times. And there is betwixt ſuch periods of time and revolution of the Church's caſe, and the bringing forth of ſuch a piece of the Scripture to a performance, a very certain and undoubted connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'Tis true, we do not yet well underſtand (which will be one of the laſt manifeſtations the Church ſhall have, at the end of time, when the myſtery of God is finiſhed) how to ſort the event exactly to the Word: but it is ſure (and were worthy of our ſtudy and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation) how every age hath ſomething of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture peculiar thereto, yea carrieth forward the Lord's work and deſign a further ſtep. May we not ſee how one age fulfilleth ſuch a piece of the Church's ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings appointed for her, and puts ſome great trial and ſad perſecution over her head, which ſhe was to meet with; whilſt another age carrieth he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thorow an other change, and giveth her a time of reſt and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? How ſuch a time bringeth Antichriſt forward to his height, and ſuch a following age begins the turn of the Church's caſe? Yea, every ſeveral period and revolution of time, ſtill addeth ſomething, to that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hiſtory of the Word and Providence, which we have ſince the beginning, and bringeth forth ſomething further into the world, of the Lord's counſel and deſign about his Church.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005185_0041_1016D92AECA5DAF8"/>
8. The accompliſhing of the Scripture is ſuch a thing, we are to look after, in a ſpecial way here, which concerns this militant and traveling condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church: for if the Scriptures were once fully accompliſhed, and the great myſtery of God therein finiſhed, there were then nothing more to do, his work of providence were at an end, and time ſhould be no more. This is ſomething, that is not here perfected at once, but is ſtill gradually car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on, and then ſhall be compleat at the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the juſt, and ſecond coming of the Lord, which is the laſt part of Canonical Scripture to be made out, when both his work and his word, and time, ſhall be all finiſhed together; but while the ſaints are yet by the way, they have the written word and all thoſe precious promiſes therein, for preſent uſe and encouragement. For that is its proper work, to take them ſafe thorow this labyrinth of the world, and when it hath brought them to land, it hath no more to do; there will be then no more need for a Chriſtian to go to a promiſe, and adventure upon it; we ſhall then no more watch, with the watchmen in a dark and ſtormy night, and hope for the breaking of the day: faith then ſhall not be at a ſtand, how ſuch a word ſhall be made out, becauſe of invincible diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in its way; no, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> it hath done its work, and that which is written ſhall be ſwallowed up, in that which is ſeen and enjoyed, all the ſtreams of our encouragement will then loſe themſelves in a greater depth. O then its finiſhed and done, what all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, propheſies, and threatnings of the Word were bringing forth: and then no more need of ſomething as a pledge and earneſt in hand, to them who have the full poſſeſſion of the inheritance, &amp; under whoſe feet the God of peace hath trod Satan and all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005185_0042_1016D9739782F390"/>
9. I ſhall add this, the accompliſhment of the Scripture is ſomething, which is not only demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to a Chriſtian by ſenſible influences, and God's ſecret working with his Spirit, but is made out to the obſervation of men, in the way of providence; and not only witneſſed by that internal evidence of the Spirit, but by an external teſtimony, which both ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally holdeth this out to the judgment, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to the ſight and experience: and this is the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and moſt full of all outward evidences, ſince the world muſt ſhut their eyes if they do not ſee it, and a Chriſtian muſt deny what he both ſeeth and feeleth, if he deny a witneſs to this.</p>
            <p>II. We would conſider the <hi>accompliſhment of the Scripture,</hi> as that which <hi>is the Lord's peculiar work and deſign in the World,</hi> and that great buſineſs which is upon the wheels of providence amidſt the various changes and revolutions, which are here within time, for bringing about whereof the bleſſed thoughts of his heart are fixed and unalterable. This is indeed a grave and ſerious truth, worthy to be more noticed and laid to heart by men, that the glorious providence of God, which goeth throughout the earth, and doth particularly reach all things which come to paſs, the ſmalleſt as well as the greateſt intereſts of men, in all theſe doth move certainly and infallibly for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of the Scripture, which is that great thing God hath before his eyes: for it is no perſonal intereſts of men, how great ſo ever they be, that can anſwer this end; it is ſomething beyond the ſetting up of Kings, or overturning Kingdoms and Nations, that he doth mind amidſt theſe various changes, which are in the World; 'tis ſome greater thing, than that which we moſt notice, the Lord thereby deſigns, how ſuch a party is advanced, and others brought low, for theſe things come within the reach of his care and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005185_0043_1016D92C812D6FF8"/>
providence, in ſo far as the fulfilling of the Scripture is therein concerned,—the outmaking of the promiſes, and threatnings: one ſyllable whereof he doth more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than all the Crowns and Kingdoms of the earth, yea will not let it fall to the ground, tho' it ſhould be at the rate of laying cities and countries deſolate. For it's in this the Lord taketh pleaſure, and exerciſeth his bleſſed tho'ts, even the bringing about what he hath ſpoken in his Word.</p>
            <p>Now to clear this further, I ſhall hold forth theſe following grounds, whence it may appear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The fulfilling of the Scripture, or written Word, is ſo great a thing, and of ſuch Concernment, that the bleſſed Majeſty of God thought it worthy of a place in his heart from all eternity. This was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in his thoughts and counſels of old; even that marvellous work, which ſhould be the after-product, and outmaking of his Word to his Church here within time, and ſurely was ſuch a plot and contrivance, that as no leſs than infinite love, wiſdom and power, were required to bring it about, ſo it was well becoming the Majeſty of God, and worthy to be the work of all the three bleſſed perſons of the Trinity. O if we could go down a little into this deep, and ſee the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that are there, we ſhould find, that knowledge which uſually leſſeneth our admiration of other things, would heighten it here: it would be new to us every day to think how great and marvelous a thing that is which the Word is bringing forth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is upon this, even the Performance of the Word, that the preſent encouragement, and future bleſſedneſs of the ſaints doth lie. For the great intereſt of the Church is adventured upon the Word, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked with it, which would be loſt; yea their ſtock and treaſure which is laid up in heaven, and all that a Chriſtian is worth, which is laid up in the promiſe, were then periſhed,—if the Scripture ſhould want an
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005185_0044_1016D9782D301998"/>
accompliſhment: the godly man hath then run and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vain, and thoſe who are fallen aſleep in Chriſt, have died in a ſad deluſion: providence would be like the work of the fooliſh builder, who begun and knew not how to finiſh. O how highly then is the Lord concerned in fulfilling of his Word? That he may perfect what concerns his people, and having ſurely paid the price put them alſo in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is yet more than the intereſts of Angels and men, yea than heaven and earth is worth, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the outmaking of the Scripture; the glory of God, and eſpecially the praiſe of that great attribute his <hi>faithfulneſs,</hi> which he will have no leſs ſhine forth in the performance of his Word, than his power and wiſdom in this great fabrick of the univerſe, and theſe marvellous productions of nature. For he hath magnified his Word above all his works: therefore is his heart greatly ſet upon this, even the bringing to paſs what he hath ſpoken; which if in the leaſt ſhould fail, this were no leſs than to make God a liar, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſify his Word, who is through all the Church known by this bleſſed name, <hi>The God of truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We ſhould conſider this, as that great truſt, which is put in his hand who only in heaven and earth was found worthy to open the Book of God's decrees and counſels, and looſe the ſeals thereof: a truſt, which the Lord did not adventure upon the Angels, the ſmalleſt promiſe being ſuch as requires no leſs than an omnipotent power and the arm of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> to bring it about. For which end, he whom the Father hath anointed, is gone forth as a mighty man who rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to run his race, that he may perform his Word, and execute this great deſign in the adminiſtration of providence, about his Church and People; which he will not ceaſe or give over, until the myſtery of God in the Scripture, and all that was ſpoken by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, be put to a cloſe, when Heaven and Earth at the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005185_0045_1016D92F99D25DE8"/>
pouring out of the laſt vial, ſhall give that ſolemn ſhout and exclamation, <hi>It is finiſhed, it is finiſhed.</hi> O if this were once fully perfect, there would be no more to do; then the Winter were paſt, and the Summer come, the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Lamb ſhould be heard, becauſe the bride hath made her ſelf ready, then let all the trees of the wood rejoice, the hills break forth into ſinging, and all that is therein be glad, becauſe the Scripture and the great deſign thereof is fully finiſhed, and the day of the perfect liberty of the Sons of God is come.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The accompliſhment of the Scripture is of ſuch concernment, that nothing can be done until it be once finiſhed. For this, time muſt wait, the Sun muſt keep its courſe, and the ordinances of the Heaven continue as they are: the World is but a ſcaffold until this build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be perfected; for this the grave doth ſtill retain her priſoners, and the duſt of the Saints muſt yet reſt in hope, the creation ſtill groaneth, and the marriage-ſupper of the Lamb is deferred, the cry of the ſouls under the altar get not a full return, until all that is written in the Word be fullfilled.</p>
            <p n="6">6. We would conſider, this is the great thing which the Lord this day is carrying on, even the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Word. For this is moſt brought upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, of any thing beſides; the World challengeth it, and the hearts of the godly do oft call it in queſtion; the Atheiſt ſcoffs at it, and ſayeth, Where is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of his coming? There are often to appearance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable difficulties in the way of its performance: therefore doth the Majeſty of God ſo much concern himſelf in this, for bringing about of which he is in a holy way reſtleſs, and providence in an unceſſant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, until he hath done that which he hath ſpoken in his Word. It was for this cauſe (that the Scripture might be accompliſhed) that the Word was made fleſh, and he who counted it no robbery to be equal with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005185_0046_1016D979C2166898"/>
God, did take upon himſelf the form of a ſervant. This is of ſuch account in his eyes, that what time he ſpeaks concerning a Nation or People, ere it come not to paſs, he will rather put forth omnipotency, for the working of miracles, and change the very courſe of nature: for this, he will make the deep dry, make a way through the red Sea, and cauſe <hi>Jordan</hi> to ſtand as in heaps, that he may keep promiſe to his People; if there be no way for bringing about his Word, but through a Sea of blood, and over the bones and carcaſſes of his enemies, he will do it, and bring it to paſs, though Walled Cities, and the Sons of <hi>Anak</hi> mighty and ſtrong, ſhould ſtand in the way thereof. <hi>Abraham</hi>'s old age, and <hi>Sarah</hi>'s dead womb, muſt not fruſtrate this: if the promiſe of the Church's reſtoration cannot be made out without a wonder ſhewed upon dry bones ſcattered at the graves mouth, this ſhall not be wanting; when God ſaith, he'll bring down the enemies of his Church, if the duſt of the ground ſhould ariſe, down they muſt come. How many great deſigns of men hath this bleſſed deſign (that the counſel of the Lord may ſtand) cruſhed and brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en? ſo that their work and counſel hath been as the Spider's web, when it ſtood croſs to this end. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly need not fear, that he be not a preſent help in time of trouble: for he will keep his word herein, though the Earth ſhould be overturned, and the Mountains caſt into the midſt of the Sea. O who hath reſiſted his counſel! What are all theſe viciſſitudes and changes here in the World, but making way for the Scripture's accompliſhment? With what deſire doth he move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this end? So that as in <hi>Z<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>chary</hi> 6. 8. the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments by him appointed for executing his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the threatinings of the Word, it's ſaid, they have quieted his Spirit, his decrees are mountains of braſs, which are unchangeable; the thoughts of his heart take place in all generations: therefore the Word
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005185_0047_1016D931BA3371D0"/>
which is gone forth out of his mouth, ſhall not return empty, but the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>The accompliſhment of the Scripture is a truth very clear and manifeſt,</hi> whereof none can pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, if they do not ſhut their eyes, and force their own light, from the fear of ſuch a diſcovery. For the obſtruction doth not lie in the darkneſs of the object, or that men cannot ſee this; ſince we have it ſo clearly held forth in great and legible characters: nay, we muſt ſay, the cauſe is culpable, there is much of the will in it, which renders ſuch an ignorance without excuſe. O that this ſhould be ſo little lookt after, a matter of ſuch near and weighty concernment, when there needs not an other demonſtration, but <hi>come and ſee</hi> the works of the Lord through the earth! For he hath here ſo far condeſcended to his People, as to bring the truth near, that they even feel and handle the ſame: yea, he doth in a manner ſay to every one as to <hi>Thomas, put in your bands,</hi> touch the Word, and truth thereof, and be no longer faithleſs, but taſte and ſee, that the Lord is good, and that he is true in what he hath ſpoken.</p>
            <p>We are indeed to look for a more clear and full diſcovery of this truth, the nearer the Church is to the end of time. There is a labyrinth, as it were, of turnings and windings, through which we may ſee the Word oft brought, ſo as we loſe ſight thereof, and are ready to ſtagger about its performance: but it's as true, that the moſt eminent confirmations, the ſaints ever had of this truth, have been after greateſt ſhakings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about. Yea, the Lord hath in all ages, ſo viſibly ſealed his Word by its performance, that we may ſay, can he be a Chriſtian and a ſtranger to this in his experience! or a ſerious on-looker on providence and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the time, wherein he lives, and a ſtranger to it, in his obſervation! yea, can any be ſo wholly
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005185_0048_1016D97D18A641C8"/>
brutiſh, as not to diſcern a thing ſo clear that oft-times thoſe who run, may read?</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak a little more to this, I ſhall here point at ſome things, that may ſhew how manifeſt this truth is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it not very clear, which we ſee every day brings to light? A truth ſo conſpicuous, both in God's ordinary way with his Church, and in the ſeveral ſteps and paſſages of a Chriſtian's life! For theſe mercies which bring the Word and promiſe to paſs, are new every morning, and cry aloud, if we could hear, great is his faithfulneſs. This is indeed tried: and needs there more, to convince a blind man, that his ſight is reſtored to him, but that he certainly ſeeth? ſure they never wanted confirmations here, who do but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſeek to be comfirmed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it not a clear truth, which not only is found upon the exacteſt tryal; but is witneſsed by ſuch who ever tryed it in their moſt preſſing ſtraits, and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? for it's in the darkeſt night this truth hath moſt brightly ſhined: and theſe more remarkable ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous acts of faith, have they not ſtill brought forth moſt convincing experiments of this truth? We may ſay, there is none can give a better account of the performance of the Word, then thoſe who againſt hope, have believed in hope, that this never made them aſhamed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not alſo clear, whereof there are ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn extraordinary confirmations in all ages? For that his name is near, his wondrous works declare. I am ſure, no time could ever deny its witneſs, how by great convincing providences, both of judgment and mercy, it hath been ſo ſealed, as hath forced Atheiſts to keep Silence: no time, wherein the Church had not cauſe to erect a pillar, and engrave thereon, <hi>We have ſeen with our eyes</hi> the great and wondrous works of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005185_0049_1016D9808C0A4680"/>
Lord, by which he hath witneſsed the truth of his Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it not a manifeſt truth, which even in the moſt ſtrange, and dark footſteps of providence, ſo clearly ſhineth forth? Theſe, which at the firſt look are an aſtoniſhment, and hard to be underſtood, yet after moſt clearly verify the Scripture; that whilſt the Lord's way goeth out of our ſight, yea, out of the ordinary road of his working, through a labyrinth of turnings, and croſs diſpenſations, yet at length it doth evidently clear, and diſintangle it ſelf, which men may oft ſee break forth as the ſun out of a dark cloud, that ſhineth the more brightly, the more at was obſcured.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Is it not very clear, which can be demonſtrated by ſuch viſible effects in theſe great changes of the World? For the fulfilling of the Scripture is not a thing hid in a corner, but oft publiſhed in the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops, that men may ſee legibly written, upon King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Nations, the deſolate ruins, and devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cities and houſes great and fair, which are made to be without inhabitants, ſo as thoſe who go by may clearly read the cauſe, and bear that witneſs, <hi>Lo, there is fin viſibly puniſhed according to the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. How clear is this, which we have ſo evidently drawn out, and acted over in a Chriſtian walk? For what elſe is the ſpiritual converſation of ſuch, thoſe viſible effects and evidences of the grace of God all along a Chriſtian's way, but a viſible convincing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the performance of the word? Have not ſuch a very audible Echo and reſound to that which is the great drift and Scope of the Scripture? where men may ſee the Bible turned over into a practical hiſtory, written forth, and acted on the heart, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the ſaints, as on a ſtage, or theatre: the Word living, ſpeaking, moving, and clearly diffuſing it ſelf through all the veins, as it were, and conduits
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005185_0050_1016D9CF7A6DAC10"/>
of a Chriſtian's life; ſo that if the truth, and reality of the grace of God be a thing manifeſt, and unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, we muſt alſo ſee therein the real performance of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I ſhall add, we may clearly ſee how one piece of the Scripture is nothing elſe but the punctual ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling, and accompliſhment of the other: how that which was ſhadowed out by dark types, under the Law, and held in a Prophecy, through the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, is written before our eyes in a plain, and real hiſtory in the New Teſtament, and that the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is only a fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets.</p>
            <p>IV. Though it is very manifeſt, and by undeniable proofs can be demonſtrated, that the Scripture hath a real accompliſhment, and doth certainly take place, in the conſtant courſe of providence here in the World, that I am ſure if men do not darken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they can be no ſtrangers to ſuch a thing; yet we muſt ſay, <hi>This truth which moſt nearly concerns us, is to the moſt of men,</hi> (even ſuch who ſeem to give a large aſſent to the Word) <hi>a myſtery and dark riddle.</hi> There are few who do but enquire if there be ſuch a thing, if the promiſes and threatnings have indeed a certain outmaking: few do ſeriouſly ponder the providences of God, in which the truth and faithfulneſs of the Word ſhineth forth, that they may thereby be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed we ſee that to many (alas too many) the great concernments of the Law and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs are a trivial and an impertinent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: this is a truth the World doth paſs without regarding: ſuch as ſport at Religion, when they come to earneſt here, dare not ſtand before this diſcovery; it concerneth them much to reconcile their principles with their practice, their fear begetteth hatred, and both put their wit and invention on the rack, how to diſpute away any remainder of a conſcience, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005185_0051_1016D984AA0074E8"/>
their light, and under the pretext of reaſon, run down godlineſs, and the abſolute neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yea, beſides, doth not ſenſuality, wherein many wallow, and ſteep themſelves, ſo dull and drown the ſoul, put ſuch an interpoſition of the Earth betwixt them, and this truth, as wholly darkens it? And, oh, how ſad, that many having a large profeſſion to be Chriſtians, ſcarce ever knew what it is to put the Word to an eſſay and trial, in the concernments of their life; to have their light followed with experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wherein the very truth and reality of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion lieth.</p>
            <p>To clear this, I ſhall hold forth ſome things, which may ſhew how little this truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's accompliſhment is known, or ſtudied by the moſt of men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The abounding of ſo much Atheiſm, that there are many who not only diſclaim the practice of that Religion they ſeem to profeſs, but do ſtate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in moſt direct oppoſition to the rules and principles thereof; theſe to whom the Scripture is but as a Romance, yea, who do only converſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to prove their wit and parts in impugning the ſame; who avowedly mock at the judgments, and providences of God; I confeſs theſe may be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Monſters, a very prodigy in the time, wherein they live; though, alas, it is not the leaſt part of the World! and which is ſtrange! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Athieſts do uſually abound where the light of the Goſpel hath moſt ſhined: the ſavage places of the Earth bring forth no ſuch monſtrous births, as are hatcht within the viſible Church; for thus the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God putteth a blacker dye on them than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. O what a terrible ſound would the fulfilling of the Scripture have in men's ears, if they once came to have ſerious thoughts thereof; ſince they cannot admit this, but they muſt certainly read their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005185_0052_1016D9D10FE47B40"/>
own ſentence of death, which a few days ſhall put in execution; and if the Scripture be true, they are then unſpeakably miſerable!</p>
            <p n="2">2. That indifferency which we ſee amongſt men about Religion, and the moſt concerning truths of ſcripture, doth ſhew how little this is known or laid to heart: whence, there is ſuch a generation who do not profeſſedly deny the ſcripture, yet can turn it over in a ſchool-problem, and wonder that men ſhould ingage ſo far upon it. It is not that it is hid from them, but they truly chuſe to hide themſelves from it; as more ſuiting that intereſt they drive, that the truth of God ſhould be rather a matter of opinion than of faith, a thing which they would diſpute, but not believe. But, O, what other thoughts would a clear ſight of this, cauſe,—That within ſo few days the truths and threatnings of the Word ſhall be ſad ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; the fulfilling whereof no ſharpneſs of wit, nor ſubtil arguments, will be able to evade!</p>
            <p n="3">3. That there is ſo much barren theory of Divine truths in the world, with ſo little ſerious Chriſtian diligence, doth it not ſadly witneſs how ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance men have with this truth? Whence, we ſee ſo great a part of thoſe who profeſſedly acknowledge the word, and are daily converſing with it, yet can give no other account thereof, but report; ſo many that can ſatisfyingly diſcourſe of the Scripture, could never put their ſeal to it, that <hi>God is true therein.</hi> Whence are ſo many great School-divines, and able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for parts, ſuch viſible Atheiſts in their way, and practice? Is it not, they really judge Divinity and Religion, rather a ſcience, and matter of ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than a matter of ſenſe and feeling, which men ſhould more live than ſpeak, and cannot be known without experience, the true end of knowledge? But, O this cannot be found in books, men will not meet with it in a throng of choiceſt notions, it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005185_0053_1016D98635C97860"/>
confoundeth the wiſe, and the diſputer of this world, whilſt the meaneſt and moſt ſimple Chriſtian of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> knoweth more than thoſe of greateſt parts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The great Hypocriſy which is in the world, I mean within the viſible Church, doth too clearly ſhew, that this truth is little thought on, or laid to heart. For what is that falſe ſhew, and appearance (which we may ſay is not a ſin, but the very ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin) Is it not the height of Atheiſm? And a real contradiction in their practice, to this, that the Scripture of God is true, and will have an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable accompliſhment? O could any be ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly irrational, to drive this poor plot, how to appear that which they are not, to be at ſuch pain to act the part handſomely of a ſerious Chriſtian, to perſonate his tears, and grief, his ſpiritual frame, his zeal for God, if he did think gravely on this truth, and did believe the threatnings of the Word; that they will ſurely take place and be within a little while no complement, but ſad earneſt, &amp; that he is every hour ſtanding under that Scripture-wo againſt Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites? I am ſure it would make his very hair ſtand upright, his joynts looſe, and his thighs ſmite upon one another, could he but ſeriouſly think upon this.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thoſe unwarrantable ways which in a time of trial men take for their eſcape, may witneſs this, that the word they do not judge a ſure ground to venture on. Whence is there ſuch heſitation in ſuffering times? From that day many taking their leave of Chriſt, who have rather choſen ſin than affliction? O is it not that they judge the teſtimony of the God of truth is not ſufficient ſecurity to carry them through ſuch a ſtrait, and are not fully perſwaded that it muſt come to paſs what he hath promiſed? For if they were, they ſhould reckon it their greateſt ſafety to embarque their intereſt on ſo ſure a ground, and with much qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005185_0054_1016D9D47A379468"/>
repoſe their ſoul, and diſburthen their care by putting it over on the word.</p>
            <p n="6">6. What doth the frequent diſcouragement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable walk of the People of God ſpeak forth? doth it not witneſs how little they are in earneſt with this great truth of the Scripture's accompliſhment, or eſtabliſht herein? What meaneth theſe diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fears, and perplexed complaints? If their eyes be but open to know they have ſuch a well as the promiſe of God, at their hand, how is it that the ſmalleſt ſtraits are ſo puzling, and ready to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit them, that they ſo uſually ſtumble at the croſs? And as things from without do appear, their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement made to ebb and flow? Is not here the cauſe, That they ſtagger at the promiſe, whilſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities in ſome viſible way, do not go along for its performance? It's truely eaſy to have ſome ſweet notions of faith at a diſtance, but whilſt the trial comes near, upon ſuch a cloſe approach, that there is not another way, but to put the whole ſtreſs of their particular intereſt on the Word, and on it alone, many are then at a ſtand, becauſe they are not thoro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured, that though the earth ſhould be overturned, there is an abſolute neceſſity for the promiſe of God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> take place.</p>
            <p>Now from theſe things may it not appear, that this grave truth of the Scripture's accompliſhment is but little known, or ſtudied? I confeſs, we may think on it with aſtoniſhment, how a matter ſo nearly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us is not more our work! there are indeed many things worthy to be known, but our ſhort life can ſcarce allow time, or give leaſure for the ſtudy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But O this, though we had only two days to live, I think might require the one, to be ſure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded about the truth of that whereon our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eternal Bleſſedneſs lieth, and on which we muſt lay our laſt Hold, when we are in the paſſage at
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005185_0055_1016D987DBC6C378"/>
that ſtrange ſtep betwixt time and eternity. O what a wonder, how rational ſouls who walk on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the greateſt hope and fear imaginable, can yet be ſo unconcerned thereabout! ſuch ſerious thoughts might force men to retire, and go fit alone; and truly theſe things gravely conſidered may ſeem ſtrange and hard to reconcile.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is ſuch a thing as the very Word and Teſtimony of God this day upon record, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we have ſo much to do, which doth offer itſelf to men's trial, and exacteſt ſearch; and yet we put it ſo little to that touchſtone, that we may know it upon an other account, than report or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How in a matter of ſuch high importance as ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through all eternity, and the ground of this hope, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> ſhould take the truth on an implicit faith, or ſatisfy themſelves with a common aſſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as though it were enough to witneſs our believing the ſame, becauſe we did never doubt or call it in queſtion: I am ſure, men would not be ſo lax, and ſo eaſy to ſatisfy, in the moſt common intereſt they have here in the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How can men render to others a reaſon of their hope, when it is enquired, who did never aſk a reaſon of this at themſelves? or will thoſe ſeal the truth with their blood, who never had it ſealed upon their heart by experience?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whence is it that men can have comfort in Scripture, who are not well grounded in the faith there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? Indeed thoſe who are ſolidly perſwaded about the truth, and its certain out-making, may have much joy and peace; whilſt they know, the ground of their confidence can bear up any ſtreſs or burden they lay upon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And for what end did the Lord witneſs the certainty of his Word by two immutable things, wherein 'tis impoſſible for him to lie, but that from ſo
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005185_0056_1016D9D829A5B670"/>
ſure and ſtrong a ground, his People might have ſtrong conſolation?</p>
            <p n="5">5. How can any think to adventure their immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul upon that, whereon they fear to venture an outward intereſt? or put over their deareſt things into his hand and keeping, who could never ſay, they know in whom they believed?</p>
            <p n="6">6. May it not ſeem ſtrange, that men can believe a certain performance of the Word and promiſes, and not be more deeply affected therewith? O is this true, ſhall it ſurely come to paſs, and not one jot thereof fall to the ground! and ſhould it not cauſe us to awake in the night, and ever bear us company? Ought we not to think our ſelves at a ſad paſs, that day, wherein we take not a turn in the meditation of divine truths, if we be ſure that theſe muſt take place?</p>
            <p n="7">7. I would add, if this be indeed the Scripture of God, which ſurely hath an accompliſhment, O how is it we are ſo little Chriſtians? Why doth men's walk ſo ſadly jar with ſo great an hope? What manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould thoſe be, that are perſwaded, within a little time theſe heavens muſt paſs away as a ſcroll, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments melt with fervent heat, and the earth be burnt up? I think, if this will not preſs home on men, to be fervent and diligent, they muſt be in a very ſad leth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>argie.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>The accompliſhment of Scripture is a moſt clear, and undeniable witneſs of its divinity;</hi> that it is his Word, who is not like man to lie, or the ſon of man to repent, and hath this as its diſtinguiſhing character, that not one ſyllable thereof falls to the ground: This is the undoubted priviledge of God, and of him alone, to foreſee things contingent, which are many ages after to fall out, &amp; have no dependence upon neceſſary, and natural cauſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and truly, this may be a convincing argument, yea, we may ſay, of all external teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005185_0057_1016D98E6032FB20"/>
is the greateſt; but it's ſtrange to think what a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration there is, who can ſport at the Scripture, and queſtion the truth thereof! who yet did never once ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly enquire if ſuch a thing be true, elſe ſo clear a witneſs might ſtare them in the face. Such a party we ſhould look on with compaſſion. It's alſo ſad to think at how poor a rate, far below their allowance, many of the Saints do here live, becauſe there is ſo little of that excellent and more noble Spirit, to ſearch the Scripture for their further comfort and eſtabliſhment thereby.</p>
            <p>It is true, this bleſſed record doth bear witneſs to it ſelf, and is known by its own light: whereon there is ſuch a viſible impreſs of the glorious God, ſuch convincing marks of its true deſcent, as may throughly ſhew whoſe it is, and how far it exceeds all human invention; and thus by a clear manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth, doth commend it ſelf to men's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, as a ſafe ground whereon they may repoſe their ſoul. It is alſo clear, how wonderfully the Scripture hath been preſerved, and the original copies thereof kept through all ages, that what ever ſmall variation there may appear as to ſome <hi>Apiculi,</hi> which in ſome places hath cauſed diverſe readings, yet in any neceſſary, or ſaving truth, the greateſt Criticks will confeſs they do not in the leaſt vary: and it is known (wherein we are to adore that ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God) that the Jewiſh Church, to whom this ſacred <hi>depoſitum</hi> was delivered, did with ſuch exact and ſingular care look to the ſame, even in the leaſt tittle, or letter thereof; this being the great work and ſtudy of the Mazorites, from one age to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to ſee to the preſerving of that great record, from being in the leaſt vitiated or corrupted; and the greateſt adverſaries of the truth cannot poſſibly deny that agreement betwixt thoſe many original copies, in the whole ſubſtance, which may be very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005185_0058_1016D9DCD0D36F20"/>
to the World. And do not men ſee, how marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the whole frame of the Scripture is? What a correſpondency betwixt all the parts thereof, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it doth in the leaſt vitiate the proportion and beauty of the work, but it has all along an evident ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to advance holineſs &amp; conform the ſoul to God. With a wonderful conſent and harmony in anſwering to this great end, we ſee the ſimplicity, and plainneſs of its ſtyle, yet backt with a convincing Majeſty, and authority upon the conſcience; yea, beſides, it hath been atteſted by miracles, that were great in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, famous in their time, tranſmitted to the Church in after-ages, with unanſwerable evidences of their truth; that not only the witneſs of the Word, but other preſſing and rational grounds may let us ſee there could be no deceit, or impoſture therein.</p>
            <p>Theſe are a great teſtimony to the truth: but I may ſay on very ſure ground, that, next to that great wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit, there is no argument more convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to reach Atheiſm a ſtroke, and throughly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy an exerciſed ſpirit, who may be plunged about this great thing, the authority of the Scripture, than a clear diſcovery of its performance whilſt under the aſſault of ſuch a temptation: if this be the very word of God, they may but retire within, &amp; then turn their eyes abroad in the World, to ſee what a viſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of the Word is ſtamped on every piece of the work, and providence of God. Now for further clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring I would offer theſe few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The accompliſhment of the Scripture is a very publick teſtimony from Heaven to its divinity, whilſt the Lord by his works through the earth, which are done in the view of Angels &amp; men, doth ſolemnly avow that this is his Word. For we muſt ſay, his work within on the hearts of his People, &amp; without about the Church, is ſuch, whereat men, yea all the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of the earth, may ſtand amazed, and confeſs that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005185_0059_1016D98FEC5215A8"/>
nothing leſs than a divine almighty power can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This gives in the witneſs of all the generation of the righteous: who from the beginning have proved the truth thereof, yea, 'tis ſealed by the blood of many excellent Chriſtians, ſome of whom though they could not well diſpute for it, yet had ſo ſtrong a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the power of the truth within, as made it an eaſy work to die for the ſame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This doth clearly ſhew, the Scripture is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable rule of righteouſneſs that alters not; but takes place in all ages, whence ſuch as are wiſe to bring providence in to the Word, and compare the experience and remarks of one time with another, may have a great reach, &amp; be thus led in a ſure path, as to the foreſeeing of events.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This alſo doth demonſtrate, that it is his Word, who doth rule and guide the World, and hath a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign dominion over the ſame: whilſt we may here ſee ſuch remarkable events, which both in the preſent and in former times have fallen out, as may ſhew a power, that can reach the greateſt with a ſtroke, ſhake the moſt eſtabliſhed Kingdoms, and even over the belly of inſuperable difficulties, accompliſh the Word; yea, that ſurely the Spirit of the wheels which moves them, is from him whoſe Word this is. For it is not more clear, that theſe curtains of the Heavens are ſtretcht forth over the earth, than that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſtretcht out over the whole work and frame of providence: ſo as that all the motions and ſteps thereof, even of the moſt caſual things that fall out, have a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tendency to accompliſh thoſe ends which the Scripture hath held forth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This clearly ſheweth, it muſt be his Word, who hath foreſeen all things that were to befal the Church, and the various changes and adventures of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's life through time: whilſt it is ſo wonderfully
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005185_0060_1016D9DE5D738148"/>
ſhaped and ſuited to every new trial of the church, as if intended only for that time, and to every caſe of a godly man, as though it had been alone writ for them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This alſo ſheweth, that he who is the author of the Scripture, and hath framed that admirable piece, muſt have ſome immediate correſpondence with the Spirit of man, knoweth our ſitting down, and riſing up, yea, doth ſearch the heart and the reins. For experience can tell how the Word is directed to the heart, doth reach the moſt inward contrivances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, doth ſo clearly reveal and open up a Chriſtian to himſelf, that we may ſay, of a truth he is the God of the Spirits of all fleſh, and one greater than our heart, whoſe it is.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I ſhall further add, the fulfilling of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the experience of the Saints doth ſhew, it is nor a dead letter, but hath power, and life; and there muſt be an enlightning quickning Spirit, that ſurely goeth along with the ſame. This clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſomething above words, yea, above nature, in the written Word, that can make ſuch a change upon the ſoul, give life to the dead, open the eyes of the blind, yea, can turn a lump of earth, that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tended downward, now without any violence to move, from a principle of life towards God, as the ſparks flee upward.</p>
            <p>VI. <hi>The accompliſhment of the Scripture is a moſt pleaſant, and truly delectable ſubject,</hi> worthy of our ſerious thoughts, and ſtudy. For here is held out the higheſt truth, for the judgment to contemplate the truth and faithfulneſs of God in the Word; and here is alſo the greateſt good for the affections to embrace, and delight in, as that wherein our whole happineſs is certainly wrapt up. It is undeniable, that it is the godly man, who knoweth beſt what true and ſolid
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005185_0061_1016D992FB87B730"/>
pleaſure is; which he doth not loſe, by turning his heart from the creature to God, but maketh a bleſſed exchange. O, how far do the joys and delights of the ſoul exceed theſe of the ſenſes! And the delight of a Chriſtian, how far doth it ſurpaſs that of a natural man, even in his beſt eſtate! and ſure, this precious ſtudy of the daily performance of the Word, is one of theſe paths of pleaſure, which would bring in more ſolid joy to the ſpirit in ſome few hours, than ſome years wallowing in the carnal delights of the fleſh, which is but as pleaſure in ſport, but quickly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to grief in earneſt. It is one of the great miſtakes of the World, that religion tends ſo much to ſadden and diſquiet the Soul; nay, it is certainly the want of this, becauſe we are ſo little truly religious. When we ſhuffle over our duty, and take but a paſſing look of the ways and work of God in the World, then it is indeed very affrighting, and unpleaſant; but when in a more Chriſtian way, we do ſeriouſly look thereupon, and get our heart near God, taking the Word along with us, O how delightful, and raviſhing a ſight will this be! I truly think, though there were not a command, though it were no duty, nor ſuch advantage in the ſtudy of this grave truth, yet that joy and refreſhment, which the ſoul would find in ſuch a diligent ſearch, in going down into this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deep, ſhould invite us thereto.</p>
            <p>But when I ſpeak of this, what a ſweet, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſubject, the performance and outmaking of the Scripture is, it muſt be underſtood, that it is ſo only to the ſaints: and it is no wonder; the World keep at ſuch a diſtance from it; for this is a truth they can not bear, they hate it, which (as <hi>Micajah</hi>) doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy alway hard things, and carrieth a meſſage of death to them; a ſerious View of this truth, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, is as the handwriting upon the wall before them, which doth foretel their approaching ruin, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005185_0062_1016D9E139B36490"/>
ſhould cauſe them all to tremble; the knowledge whereof muſt encreaſe their ſorrow, and diſquietneſs, yea, cauſe them to cry out, O, do not torment us before the time. For they are ſurely undone, and ruined, if the Scripture of God be true, and hath a performance. But, O what pleaſant and refreſhful tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, doth this carry to a Chriſtian! What a ſweet view doth he here get of the inheritance, and bleſſed eſtate of the ſaints, which may cauſe ſuch an excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, How great is that goodneſs, which is laid up for thoſe that fear thee!</p>
            <p>To demonſtrate this, I ſhall hold out ſome things, from which we may ſee how delightful a ſubject the accompliſhment of the Scripture is, for a Chriſtian to ſtudy.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Serious converſe with this grave truth leadeth forward to practice, and thus helpeth to bring down theory to experience: which is the moſt ſweet, and deſirable of all other demonſtrations, that we can have of the truth of the Scripture, and maketh our light clear, and pleaſant to the eyes, turning the exerciſe of our judgment and reaſon thereabout, into ſenſe and feeling; we are then made to ſee what a difference there is, betwixt that diſcovery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a ſpiritual man (whoſe religion is his practice) hath of this, and the cold winter-light of natural underſtanding, that hath no heat or warmth therewith; which is as great a difference, as betwixt hearing of ſuch a thing by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſeeing it with our eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This bleſſed ſtudy, how the Scripture hath cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain accompliſhment, would help us to read the Word with an other kind of pleaſure. O, what repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould then the truths and promiſes thereof have to the godly man? It would be as one going in to look over his charters, and the great things therein contained, which he doth not in the leaſt debate, or queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince they are paſt the ſeals, and fully ratified,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:005185_0063_1016D99492331690"/>
and now conſidereth all which is promiſed, as his own, which he lookt in former times upon, but as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing, whilſt he made not earneſt of the certainty thereof, and what an intereſt he had in the ſame. O, when he readeth that promiſe of a new heaven and earth, &amp; that glorious eſtate which abideth the Saints; He cannot turn his eyes &amp; thoughts ſo eaſily off it, but is made to ſtand, and wonder, that ſo great a thing, that will make ſuch a marvellous change in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is even ſhortly to come to paſs! How ſweet and pleaſant is it, for ſuch an one to turn over the promiſes, who can ſet to his ſeal, and bear this witneſs, that he hath as really prov'd the truth thereof by ſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, as he knoweth he hath a real being! Surely the Bible is an other thing to theſe, than it is to the greater part of men, who only make it the ſubject of their contemplation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In this bleſſed ſtudy we ſhould have much bro't to our hand to obſerve, and our obſervation made ſweet, and pleaſant to us. For there we might ſee how all the paths of the Lord towards his People are mercy and truth: this would give us a refreſhing diary of providence; how in ſuch a plunging ſtrait we found the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſenſibly ſealed; what obſervable confirmations we have had therewith, at ſuch a time and in ſuch a condition; the after-recounting of which in an hour of trial, or in the evening of our life, would exceed the greateſt pleaſures, the men of this World can have, in looking over their gold and greateſt treaſures, which for many years they have been laying up.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the ſerious ſtudy of the daily accompliſhing of the Scripture, we ſhould have a moſt ſatisfying view and proſpect of what God is doing up and down the earth; what purpoſes and deſigns he hath on foot; and how things here beneath do work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for carrying on of the ſame. We ſhould ſee what
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005185_0064_1016D9E2DABC3D00"/>
in excellent and curious piece of work this frame of providence is, which the more it is conſidered, it will be the more a wonder; how perfect in all its various colours; what an obſervable concurrence there is here; how ſeveral diſcords, which we ſee here, do yet agree with one conſent, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of God's deſign, which is ſtill going on: and whilſt we think there muſt be ſome diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the wheels, we are made after to ſee that this confuſion was an excellent ſtep of providence, confounding the wiſdom of men; every piece of his way being ſo knit to another, as diſcovers to ſuch who make this bleſſed truth their ſerious ſtudy, a moſt rare contexture, beyond the reach of the greateſt artiſts that ever was. Here alſo we might go up to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> tower of Chriſtian obſervation, and from thence take a grave view of God's way, and lay his work in the World to the ſcripture as the meaſuring line; where we ſhould ſee (and find the ſight thereof very pleaſant) how the Word every day takes place, doth iſſue through all the veins and arteries of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, each line whereof is ſo exactly drawn, as by a pencil in ſome ſkilful hand, to that great exemplar of the Scripture. Here we might diſcern thoſe eminent examples of judgment and mercy, that in every age are ſet before us how wicked men proſper for a time, yet have a dreadful iſſue, and are ſuddenly caſt into deſtruction; they ſpread as a green bay tree, and within a little time their place cannot be found; alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow the godly are oft ſore afflicted, yet flouriſhing as the palm-tree, and the more they are depreſſed, the more they grow:—how the enemies of the Church are oft lifted up, for a ſorer fall; and the Church brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ow, in order to her greater enlargement:—how judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment findeth out ſinners, and is oft exactly propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in meaſure and kind to the ſin; and on the other hand how integrity is ſore toſſed oft, yet ſtill falleth
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005185_0065_1016D999564AF860"/>
upon its feet, and overclouded that it may ſhine more brightly after: How the threatnings of the Word do viſibly overtake Kingdoms and Nations, bring down great houſes, cauſe thoſe brought up in ſcarlet to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the dung-hill, and oft let not the hoary head of <hi>cruel</hi> and wicked men go into the grave in peace: and again to conſider how the Lord forſaketh not his People, but ſheweth reſpect to their way; the good man walketh in his integrity, and his ſeed after him is bleſſed. O, how ſweet an exerciſe were this for a Chriſtian, even to loſe himſelf in!</p>
            <p n="5">5. From thence we might in a great meaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>what of the night</hi> it is with the Church: if there be any evidences that it is near day; and what ſuch a ſinful caſe doth threaten; we ſhould be ſkilful to feel the Churches pulſe, and thereby find what ſymptoms there are of life or death and perceive a dark cloud of judgment advancing, when it is but like an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breadth. Surely this ſtudy would make us wiſe to know the times, and what we ought to do therein; for amongſt thoſe various events which fall out in every age, the Lord's way is conſtant with itſelf, and with his truth, if we be right Obſervers.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Here we ſhould have a moſt pleaſant and clear view, how the Scripture of God comprehendeth the whole ſtate of the Church, from the beginning to the end of time: that it is a moſt full, and perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of all the viciſſitudes and alterations, which are to go over her head, whilſt in a militant condition; and doth alſo moſt exactly point out thoſe occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and remarkable events, which fall out in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way and courſe of providence, that we may read them as evidently in the Word, as we ſee them with our eyes fall out in the World. For in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſtudy, we ſhould clearly ſee how the Scripture bringeth the Church to light, out of the womb of an eternal decree, and doth trace it from the firſt promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005185_0066_1016D9E8F7FA9CB8"/>
of the Goſpel after the fall, through theſe dark times before the flood, whilſt it was but in families, and through that long trial in Egypt, and all its ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and flouriſhing condition in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and carrieth her for-ward through all the ſeveral changes of her caſe, under her following decay, and in the time of the captivity, even to the manifeſtation of Chriſt, and dawning of the goſpel: and as it thus taketh in within its reach the whole eſtate and the ſpecial events, which did befal the Church under the Law, ſo we may ſee how the Scripture alſo followeth the Church, through the whole time of the goſpel, and bringeth her as a grain of muſtard-ſeed from a day of ſmall things, until it bring her to perfection, taketh her as it were by the hand from her infancy, and goeth with her through all the turnings of her condition; through that long and dark night of Antichriſt's reign, pointeth clearly out her condition, and various aſſaults that ſhe ſhould endure in that time, and that bleſſed victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which ſhe ſhould afterwards have, though not all at once, but gradually, over her enemies; and that the Word and the Church do never part, but one walketh ſtep for ſtep with the other, until it bring her ſafe to land, and as it were put her off its hand and guard, at the coming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This would alſo help us to ſweet thoughts, and give us matter of a ſong in the ſaddeſt night of the Church's condition. When we ſee how God's great deſign in the World is the accompliſhing of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and know that his ends which he hath held forth therein, cannot be fruſtrated, it would ſerve to ſilence all our complaints, with wondering at God's way, and triumphing in the works of his hands: we ſhould not then be afraid of evil tidings; a ſtormy time would not outwit us; being perſwaded that though the earth ſhould be overturned, it ſhall be ſurely well with the righteous, the Church muſt flouriſh,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005185_0067_1016D99DA2214630"/>
and all her enemies be found liars, becauſe he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that hath promiſed, whoſe Word will as ſurely come to paſs, as the ſun doth return after a dark night.</p>
            <p>VII. <hi>It doth now more ſpecially concern the godly in theſe latter times, to ſtudy this great truth of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Scripture,</hi> and ſet about a ſerious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and ſearch therein, as a truth that ſhall yet be in a further meaſure diſcovered, and opened up, the nearer the Church is to the end of time: which may thus appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Herein is the Word expreſs, that one piece of the Scripture, which from former ages was ſealed up, ſhould in the latter days be clear, and eaſy to underſtand. Dan. 12. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. The ſeal is there put on; <hi>but go thy way</hi> Daniel, <hi>for theſe Words are cloſed up and ſealed till the time of the end.</hi> But, Rev. 22. 9. We have that bar taken of, <hi>Seal not the ſayings of the Prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand;</hi> becauſe then the time did draw near, to which a more full diſcovery and opening of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was reſerved, and a more large manifeſtation of the ſpirit beyond former ages. Now by the laſt days, we are not only to underſtand the whole time of the goſpel, though it is thus termed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the latter part of theſe laſt times, which is more eſpecially pointed at, even the cloſe and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of time, that laſt <hi>Epocha,</hi> and period of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick chronology, to which a greater accompliſhment of Scripture-Prophecies is reſerved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This alſo is expreſly promiſed that in the latter days, the Church ſhall have a more full diſcovery of this truth, how the Scripture is verified, Dan. 12. 4. <hi>Many ſhall run to fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed;</hi> which increaſe, as it clearly pointeth at the laſt times, and that bright day the Church ſhall have, when Iſrael ſhall be brought in to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:005185_0068_1016D9EC288F3590"/>
Chriſt, it doth alſo point at and promiſe ſome grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light, and a more full opening up of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the word, and fulfilling thereof: For the former part of the Chapter ſheweth, that increaſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge doth relate to thoſe things which were before ſealed. We wait and believe the further accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this promiſe to the Church, beyond all we have yet ſeen; that many Scripture-truths, now dark and abſtruſe, ſhall be made ſo clear, as ſhall even cauſe us to wonder at the groſs miſtakes we once had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yea, that after-generations ſhall have a diſcovery and inſight into ſome Prophecies now obſcure, which ſhall as far exceed us, as this time doth go beyond former ages, which comparatively we muſt ſay were very dark. O! when that promiſe of the in-calling of the Jews ſhall once take place, what a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will they be to themſelves, that their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould have been under ſuch a vail, when the truth ſhall be clear, and evident to them in that day! Will it not be a ſweet and eaſy work, for the godly to ſort together the predictions of the Word, and the events? And truly there is much now wrapt up in Scripture-Prophecies, not yet fulfilled, which (we may ſay) in aftertimes, when the event ſhall unvail their meaning, will exceed, yea, confound all thoſe comments, many have had upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not alſo clear, that thoſe Prophecies, which of all the Scripture were moſt obſcure, and overcloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with dark figures and allegories, concerning which there had been ſuch miſtake and heſitation by the Church, ſo many perplexing queries, have a peculiar reſpect to the laſt times? And that then they ſhall be made plain, and eaſy, when ſo notable a key, as the event doth open them up; ſuch as thoſe of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes recovering life, and riſing again, Babylon's fall and ruin, Chriſt reigning with his Saints a thouſand Years, which now are in ſome meaſure already cleared,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005185_0069_1016D99F2F6A5610"/>
from their begun accompliſhment, beyond former times; but we wait for a more full commentary, that time ſhall give upon the ſame.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is in the latter times, that the glory of God in his truth and faithfulneſs, ſhall moſt eminently ſhine forth. That is a part of the ſolemn congratulation of the Church upon Babylon's fall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. not only <hi>Great and marvellous are thy works,</hi> but, <hi>juſt and true are thy ways.</hi> For truly in this ſtroke of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and thoſe remarkable providences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring therewith, the fulfilling of the Scripture will be ſo plain and undeniable, that we may ſay, it will then dazel the eyes of men, even greateſt Atheiſts, alarm the World, yea very effectually contribute (we have ground ſo to judge) to that promiſed encreaſe of the Church, and incoming of the Jews, when in Antichriſt's fall and ruin they ſhall ſee ſo convincing a ſeal put to one of the moſt conſiderable Prophecies of the Word; in the accompliſhment whereof much of the Prophetick part of the New-Teſtament, relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Church's ſtate, and her long trial under Antichriſt's reign, may be ſeen clearly verified.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Lord hath reſerved his greateſt Works to the latter days, wherein his judgments ſhall be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and the Word confirmed by ſuch ſolemn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing providences, that men will not get them paſſed without a remark: we are this day witneſſes to many ſuch, and are looking what theſe times ſhall yet bring forth, that the great and remarkable acts of the Lord muſt force the World to ſee a divine power; and ſay, lo, there is an undoubted accompliſhment of the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Church in theſe laſt Times hath peculiar advantages, for underſtanding this truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's accompliſhment, which former ages had not. 1. A great part thereof is now fulfilled, that men may ſee with their eyes, if they but know how to lay the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005185_0070_1016D9EDE6A2EA38"/>
Word and Work of God together. The Chriſtian Church had in former times but dark glances at theſe great things, which we have this day viſibly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed in providence; the promiſes were then tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in birth of that which is now brought forth. 2. Are we not mounted, as it were, on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that experience and obſervation of former times, which hath been tranſmitted to us? and we muſt ſay upon that account, the Church hath now a greater ſeal and confirmation of the truth, then what it had in the days of the Prophets, and the Apoſtles, even when Chriſt was in the fleſh. 3. The Temple of God and Ark of his Teſtament is now opened in Heaven, light more fully abounding, and the means of knowledge. And, O! ſhould not this be much our ſtudy, who have a greater talent than former ages! cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this will be a ſin of a deeper dye, than in times of ignorance; ſince we can be no ſtrangers to this truth, without ſhutting our eyes, blinding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, doing violence to our light, when the Lord doth give his People ſuch ſolemn confirmations.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I ſhall add, is it not clearly foretold in that <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 4. that in the laſt times this will be one of the ſpecial exerciſes of the ſaints to enquire, and make a diligent ſearch concerning the Scriptures accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment? For it's there ſaid, <hi>many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed;</hi> importing, that this ſhall be much their ſtudy, and cauſe a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearch, whereunto the great works of God in theſe times ſhall invite them: And what ſhould be the poſture of the Godly in theſe days, on whom the end of the world is come? ſhould it not be like the watchman in the laſt-watch of the night, who looketh oft what appearance there is from the eaſt of the day breaking? a ſerious enquiry what of the Scripture is fulfilled, whereby we may know on very clear grounds,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005185_0071_1016D9A25B327E70"/>
if the night be far ſpent, the day at hand, &amp; that the coming of the Lord to judgment draweth near.</p>
            <p>VIII. <hi>This is a great, and concerning duty for Chriſtians to ſtudy this truth, that they may have ſomething more than Report, how the Scripture hath a ſure accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and doth take place in the providences of the time wherein we live. I muſt think it ſtrange, that there is ſuch a great help as this, ſo near, and yet we ſee it not, nor do ſeriouſly ponder the ſame, when the command is ſo expreſs to obſerve the works of the Lord, which for that end are ſhewed forth, that men may enquire, and read the faithfulneſs of God therein; yea, that ſo great a truth, which would abide the ſearch of all the criticks of the World, a truth wherein our bleſſedneſs through time and eternity li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhould offer it ſelf to our trial, and yet, is ſo little known! O, who can diſpenſe with the neglect of this duty? by which we anſwer that ſolemn call and invitation of the works of God, do honour him, ſerve our generation, are helpers to our own faith, and are thereby helped to ſtrengthen others, yea, are brought to ſee with our eyes, and from experience, what before was as a ſtrange thing unto us.</p>
            <p>Now to clear how much this is a Chriſtian's duty, to ſtudy a practical converſe with the Word, and to be ſerious obſervers of its accompliſhment, let us conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are thus helped to declare the Works of the Lord, and to give him the glory of his faithfulneſs. And is not that a weighty duty? Which at all times, in every ſtation and condition of life, ſhould engage men to this ſtudy. Thus, every Chriſtian may become a witneſs to the truth, and put his ſeal thereto; for which he ſhould think his life truly deſireable, and doth in no ſmall meaſure attain the true end thereof, though he had no other opportunity, for his maſter's

ſervice. We may ſay, this truth of the Scripture's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, like a great roll, hath been tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from hand to hand, from one age to another, atteſted and as it were ſubſcribed by ſo many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it doth thus come to our time, and to every man's door and require their perſonal witneſſing and ſealing of the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſhould make it an eaſy work, to truſt the Word, and to adventure thereon in the ordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences of their life. They may well truſt God in a ſtrait, who have ſo ſtrong an argument to make uſe of, that oft they have tried him, and the truth of his Word, by many, many experiences. Will not <hi>thoſe that know his name, truſt on him?</hi> Which was a notable teſtimony from a ſerious Chriſtian in a very ſharp trial; "Oft have I tried God, and ſhall I not learn to truſt him once?</p>
            <p n="3">3. This doth lay the Chriſtian in the way of that promiſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. <hi>laſt. ver.</hi> a promiſe truly large and comprehenſive, but little conſidered, that <hi>ſuch as are wiſe to obſerve the works of God, they ſhall ſee the loving kindneſs of the Lord,</hi> even in their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar caſe made out to them, yea, whilſt they are ſerious to obſerve his works abroad in the World, and his way to others, they ſhall be no loſers thereby at home; but find this promiſe meet them and turn their general obſervation, into perſonal experience of the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thus the ſaints by experiencing the truth of the Word, get a convincing ſeal thereby to their intereſt in the promiſe. For begun poſſeſſion is indeed a ſtrong witneſs to this right, when they can ſay, they have got as certain returns of the Word, which they have put to an eſſay, in ſome particulars of their life, as they are ſure of any thing they did ever ſee; ſo that from unqueſtionable experience they may ſet up a pillar, and write thereon, <hi>Hitherto hath the Lord helpt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:005185_0073_1016D9A43AE8B428"/>
5. Thus ſhould Chriſtians, with much advantage, be helped to convince gainſayers. For it's ſure, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm could not make ſo bold and publick an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, if men did not ſo much take their religion on truſt. O, the ſerious experienced man can with an other confidence own the truth; whoſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and obſervation of the works of God give him an argument that none can anſwer, while not only he can aſſert, but conduct and lead men to the things themſelves, that they may ſee, if in ſuch and ſuch particulars the Scripture be not truly fulfilled.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thus the providence of God would have a more ſweet refreſhing countenance: when from this great height, that watchtower of Chriſtian obſervation, we take a view thereof. And truly, otherways, men will ſtumble at the moſt ordinary diſpenſations, and think God's Work is a maſs of confuſion: but here we are taught to ſee, how the written Word and his way are linked in a moſt ſweet agreement.</p>
            <p n="7">7. We may thus trace Divine truth, even by our ſenſe and feeling, and joyn the Word and experience in a regular correſpondence: yea, thus we ſhould have a clear tranſcript of the Lord's way with his Church, taken out of that great authentick original of the Scripture, and there ſee on what a ſolid baſis and foundation, that magnificent ſtructure of providence is raiſed up. What a notable key ſhould we thus have for opening the Scripture, by a ſerious hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inquiry after the works of God? Where not only the impreſſion and ſign of the power, but of the truth and faithfulneſs of the Lord, are ſo very le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This is a piece of our talent, wherewith we are entruſted; of which every Chriſtian ſhould ſtudy a ſerious improvement, knowing they muſt render an account, what their obſervation of this great truth
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:005185_0074_1016D9F3D1209CF0"/>
hath gained, and what further eſtabliſhment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation they have thus attained.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I would add, the concernment and weight of this ſtudy may preſs it much on us. For, if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's accompliſhment be an undoubted truth, O! then this is ſure, the Saints have a great inheritance: they are Princes, though now under a diſguiſe; and though yet minors, they are heirs of more than the World can ſhadow forth. The Chriſtian is then more happy on a dunghil, ſcraping his ſores, than ſuch who are cloathed in purple, and fare delicately every day. If this be ſure, we ſhould look with compaſſion, rather then envy, on thoſe whom the World doth account happy: We need not queſtion the gain of Godlineſs; then it is ſure, that ſuch who ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy; and the righteous though now trampled upon, in the morning ſhall have dominion. Yea, in a word, we may then on ſure ground ſolace our ſelves with the thoughts of that great change, which will be within a little time when the grave muſt render back her priſoners; and may with as much aſſurance of a bleſſed reſurrection, lie down in the duſt, as we are ſure there will be a morning, when we lie down at night. O! then, there is a Heaven, and a Hell, that is certain; eternity is not a night-dream; and one moment ſhall ſhortly put an end to all our ſervices, yea, the ſhutting of our eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids at death, ſhall but open them in the Paradiſe of God.</p>
            <p>Having touched this truth a little in the general, I ſhall now hold forth ſome arguments, whence <hi>the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the Scripture</hi> may be demonſtrated: they are theſe five, which I intend to proſecute in the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:005185_0075_1016D9A5EB118EF8"/>
               <hi>FIRST Argument,</hi> To prove the Scripture is certainly fulfilled, and hath an accompliſhment, is this; That which hath been in all ages the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Saints; what every particular Chriſtian doth ſeal, from their frequent and ſure experience; what is found and proved by them, in their daily walk, upon exacteſt trial; yea, what as many as ever were ſerious in religion, do witneſs, muſt be certain and true.</p>
            <p>But the accompliſhment of the Scripture is ſuch: Therefore, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>II. Argument.</hi> That which is manifeſt and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible in the whole courſe and tenor of providence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Church, and by clear convincing inſtances both of judgment and mercy is made out to the obſervation of every age, muſt be a certtin truth. But the Scripture's <hi>accompliſhment</hi> is ſuch,—Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>III. Argument.</hi> That which hath not only the Chriſtian's teſtimony from experience, and of the Church from conſtant obſervation, but is obvious even to the view of the World; that which, from the conſcience of the worſt of men doth force a teſtimony, that they can neither ſhift nor deny; which alſo may be demonſtrated to the conviction of ordinary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers, and hath a publick acknowledgement from greateſt Atheiſts and mockers of religion in every age, muſt ſurely be a clear truth.</p>
            <p>But, &amp;c. Therefore—.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV. Argument.</hi> That which was to take place in ſuch and ſuch periods of time, and hath accordingly come to paſs, the event exactly anſwering to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; yea, that whereof a great part is now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and but a little at this day remaineth to be made out, muſt be a certain truth.</p>

               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:005185_0076_1016D9F87881DDB8"/>
But a great part of the Scripture is thus already fulfilled, and but a little thereof now remaineth.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>V.

Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="argument">
               <head>The FIRST ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>THat the Scripture of God, contained in the old and new Teſtaments, wherein our great hope and comfort doth lie, is certainly true, and hath a real accompliſhment, may be thus demonſtrated: <hi>That it is tried, and proved in the godly man's Experience, to which in all ages, yea, from innumerable Proofs, the ſaints have put to their ſeal, that this is a ſure and faithful teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Experience</hi> is indeed a ſtrong demonſtration: and it is ſuch a witneſs, as leaveth no room for debate. For here the truth is felt, proved, and acted on the heart; which the Chriſtian knoweth well, and is as ſure of, as he is perſwaded that he liveth, or that the ſun when it ſhineth, hath light and warmth therewith. It is true, the World liveth at a great diſtance from this; they only converſe with the ſound of ſuch a thing: and we know, the naked theory of Scripture-truth hath but a ſhort reach, and that it differeth as far from that which a ſerious practical Chriſtian hath, as the ſight of a country in a map is from a real diſcovery of the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005185_0077_1016D9AE9366B0A8"/>
ſame; where the difference is not in the degree, but in the kind. Yet, tho' this weighty teſtimony of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience is a thing whereto many (alaſs! too many) are ſtrangers, we muſt ſay, ſo much thereof is obvious, as may force its authority on men's conſciences, and ſhew there can be no fallacy or deluſion in this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if they but allow the uſe and exerciſe of reaſon: ſeeing it is not the record of a few, at one time, or in one corner of the earth, but a ſolemn witneſs from the ſaints and followers of God, whoſe judgment and integrity their adverſaries muſt often confeſs; yea, of all the ſaints in every age through the whole univerſal Church in parts of the earth moſt remote from other; and this by moſt frequent renewed proofs hath found and experienced the truth and real accompliſhment of the Word. And now, if this be not ſufficiently convincing, I would but add, O <hi>will you then come and ſee!</hi> be but Chriſtians indeed, and then ye will no more debate that teſtimony. And truly it is a very poor ſhift, for men, who have the Scripture before them, which of itſelf doth witneſs its authority, and this backed with ſo ſolemn a ſeal from the Lord by his works and providence, to debate the Chriſtians witneſs, from their experience, becauſe they do not ſee this themſelves: For what is the cauſe thereof? is it not their choice, that they do not <hi>follow on to know</hi> the ſame? The truth of God ſeeketh credit from no man upon truſt; yea, craveth no more but that by a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical converſe they would put it to a trial: and then it ſhall not decline their judgement.</p>
               <p>Now to proſecute this argument a little, I ſhall point at ſome ſpecial <hi>Scripture-truths,</hi> with which Chriſtians have moſt uſual trade and converſe in their own caſe; and give in therewith their teſtimony how theſe are clearly proved and verified by moſt ſure <hi>experience.</hi> It is not to be here underſtood,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:005185_0078_1016D9FA13A18B10"/>
the giving a particular account, with reſpect to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, time, or other circumſtances, how the Word doth thus take place. I think, it may be ſufficiently convincing, to inſtance in the general ſuch clear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controverted experiences, which are well known to the godly, and have by them been oft proved amidſt the various changes of their life (though not by all in the ſame meaſure, but in ſome ſuitable proportion to their different ſizes, trials, and wreſtlings) which can witneſs that real correſpondence, which the Word hath with the experience of the ſaints: and truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe I may with ſome confidence aſſert, they are not naked or airy notions, but ſuch as can witneſs their truth to the ſerious experienced Chriſtian, whom on this account I dare atteſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here inſtance in five ſpecial truths of the Word, which are much tried and proved in Chriſtians experience. 1. That there is ſuch a contrariety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fleſh and the ſpirit, as the Scripture holdeth forth. 2. The deceitfulneſs of man's heart. 3. That there is a ſpiritual and inviſible adverſary, with whom we have war. 4. That the promiſes of the Word have undoubted accompliſhment. 5. That truth alſo of the threatnings; I mean, ſuch under whoſe reach the godly may fall.</p>
               <p>I. <hi>That there is a contrariety betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit,</hi> a Law in our members rebelling againſt the Law of our mind, is a truth very clearly proved to the Chriſtian; whoſe experience, though ſad, doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably verify and confirm the Scripture, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 19, 21, 23. This is a piece of the Word which holds forth man's nature in its true ſhape and form, whither their byaſs and inclination moſt eaſily turneth: yea, ſo marvellouſly anſwereth their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that to queſtion the ſame, were to put it far beyond queſtion, that they know nothing of a new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005185_0079_1016D9B085F7DCD0"/>
or principle of grace within. For whatever made earneſt of Religion, but their firſt acquaintance with the peace of God was the beginning of this war? It is then that the houſe divideth, and corruption ſetteth up a ſtandard; yea, no ſooner can any begin to be a Chriſtian, but he muſt be a ſouldier alſo. And we may ſay, none ever attained ſuch a meaſure of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or was ſo old in the grace of God, as could priviledge them from the ſtirrings of the old man, and neceſſity of that complaint, <hi>Who ſhall deliver us from the body of death!</hi> But what ever advantage ſome of the ſaints have above others, yet in this their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience can witneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They now know two different parties within themſelves, that until once grace came they could not underſtand; which at the ſame time, in the very ſame action, do act oppoſitly one to the other: yea, that there is no ſpiritual duty, wherein the fleſh (though not always in ſuch a prevalent degree) doth not ſhew ſome active reſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all the ſtirrings and motions of the fleſh have ſtill a tendency, congruous to their own nature, to turn the heart carnal, and to alienate it from God; ſo as it is eaſy to diſcern, how in theſe the riſe and the end do throughly correſpond.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this is a cruel taſkmaſter, if once it bear ſway; imperious in its command, and violent in its purſuit: ſo that their experience may herein tell, it's a ſore and an intolerable thing, for a <hi>ſervant to bear rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That to things moſt forbidden the fleſh moveth moſt impetuouſly; ſo, as it will even break through the hedge, though ſure thereby to be ſcratcht with thorns: yea, it is oft ſo eager in its purſuit, that it will follow the bait, while the hook is moſt diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:005185_0080_1016D9FD36C08E48"/>
5. That when once this doth ſwell, and wax fat; they may upon another intereſt cry, <hi>Woe's us, our leanneſs!</hi> For, like the ſcales of the ballance, they find a proportionable abatement and depreſſing of their ſpiritual life, as the fleſh goeth up; yea, they have cauſe to know how every ſtep of their heart going forth to the World, is a ſtep that doth put them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off from God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the more cloſely the Law is preſt in its ſpiritual extent, yea, the more ſpiritual a duty is, the more fully oppoſite they find their carnal heart: and though the fleſh may bear up a little with the form of Religion, and hath more complacency with that way which lieth moſt in externals, yet it cannot endure the power thereof; it can ſuffer men to be Hypocrites, but not truly Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="7">7. To reſtrain and bring this under bondage, they find that it doth put the ſpirit ſo much at liberty, which getting looſe reins for a little while will leave the ſoul work for many days, and with ſad after-groans pay back an hour's pleaſure: yea, they alſo know, when the outward man is low, and under a ſenſible decay, it hath not then hindered, but rather effectually helped their inward joy and ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That indulgence to the fleſh cauſeth a ſenſible thick interpoſition between Heaven and the ſoul; whence they are ſo clogged and hampered in their flight and motion toward God; yea, thus have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their choiceſt duties been made a ſore and grievous taſk.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That this is the true riſe of their uſual pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations, and doth ſtill put ſome jar betwixt them and their lot and doth hinder a ſatisfied enjoying of that which they have, through murmuring at that they want; yea, they know, that to pleaſe the fleſh hath been oft the cauſe of their greateſt grief and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:005185_0081_1016D9B21B6E9928"/>
10. They alſo find how the defilement of their ſpirit doth help to darken it: which overgrown with the fleſh, can have no clear diſcovery of ſpiritual things; but the more ſeparate from the body, and purged from theſe groſs dregs, they find themſelves at a further advantage to converſe with divine truths, which thus they get diſcovered, beyond all that nature can reach.</p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>That the heart of man is deceitful, and deſperately evil</hi> (Jer. 17. 9. Jer. 4. 14. Prov. 4. 23.) <hi>Is a Scripture truth, where to the Chriſtians experience</hi> doth anſwer, as the face anſwereth to its ſelf in the glaſs: yea, we may ſay, it is ſo clearly demonſtrated to thoſe who were ever ſerious about their inward caſe, that while they thus read the Word in themſelves, and are made to read themſelves in the Word, they may with wonder acknowledge, that he which can ſound this great deep of the heart, and draw ſo vive a portraicture thereof, is ſurely one before whom all things are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; who doth ſearch and try the reigns, and know what is our mould and faſhion. This is one of the very firſt leſſons, which practical Religion doth teach: and the more nearneſs with God, and further meaſure of grace, that is attain'd, the more clear diſcovery there will be of this. O what ſad hours, what bitter complaints, hath it cauſed? This oft doth marr the Chriſtian's feaſt, and mingle their Wine with Gall and wormwood. I am ſure, if that excellent company of the Saints, who have been from the beginning to this day, could be brought together, to give in their ſuffrage, and witneſs concerning the deceitfulneſs of the heart, there would be one joynt teſtimony to this truth. We ſhould find that <hi>Enoch</hi> who walk'd with God, <hi>Moſes</hi> with whom he ſpake face to face, that beloved Diſciple who leaned on Chriſt's boſom, and
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005185_0082_1016D9FF218B2C68"/>

                  </gap>, but could witneſs thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is within which aileth them moſt, and their greateſt adverſaries are men of their own houſe: yea, that in the worſt of times, there is ſtill more cauſe to complain of an evil heatt, then of an evil and corrupt World; there being no worſe company, than they are oft to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That no time of their life, but might give them ſome further proof, that they are fools, who truſt their own heart, which oft will eſcape and over-reach their quickeſt reflexion, even when both their eyes are on it; yea, that there is no time that alloweth the putting off their armour, or to diſmiſs their guard; not the beſt caſe, the greateſt eſtabliſhment in grace, nor the evening of the day, though they were within ſome minutes of the crown and compleat victory, doth priviledge them from the experience of a deceitful heart.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That under the beſt frame, they find, there will often lurk that which after-time doth diſcover, that for the preſent (though it had been told) they could not have believed, until frequent experience maketh them ſee, that the Word knew their heart better than themſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That to bring home their heart, when once it goeth abroad, or recall the liberty they have given it, is not eaſy; which doth no ſooner parley with a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at a diſtance or adventure to ſport therewith, but it quickly turneth to earneſt and is ready to yield.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They know the conſtant need to have a watch upon their ſenſes, and to make a Covenant with their eyes, which do quickly betray their heart; ſo eaſy it is to be deceived, yea, to grow warm, and to take fire upon the ſmalleſt touch.</p>

6. How quickly alſo their ſpirit doth ſlacken, and loſe its bent, even in the greateſt advantage of their caſe; their experience can tell, that when in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they have been raiſed up in any ſpiritual enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were then in hazard to be lift up to the wind, and to have their ſubſtance diſſolved in the more ſolid part of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. What a ſight have they ſometime of themſelves? ſuch as would be a terrour to them, if the heart and motions thereof could be writ out to the view of others, or that any were witneſſes to that which in one room will dwell beſides the grace of God as its next door-neighbour.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In a word their experience doth witneſs, how ſoon the ſtrongeſt reſolutions will evaniſh; that they are not oft in the evening, what they were in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor for many hours do they keep the ground they had attained: but <hi>Reuben's</hi> Character, <hi>unſtable as water,</hi> may be ſtill their complaint. Yea, I am ſure as many as ever obtain'd mercy to know themſelves, can tell that it's paſt all reckoning, how oft their heart hath deceived them, when they truſted it moſt. This every day may cauſe them to ſit down, and admire the grace of God; which can mend what they ſo oft marr; and is ſtronger to ſave and preſerve, than they are to deſtroy.</p>
               <p>III.

This is indeed a truth, which Chriſtian <hi>experience</hi> in all ages doth witneſs, that no ſooner they had a ſerious look after God, but found themſelves purſued by an inviſible party, whoſe approaches, though ſpiritual, are yet certain, and moſt ſenſibly demonſtrated; beſide

That there is ſurely another party than the World, or themſelves, with which they have to do; an <hi>inviſible adverſary without,</hi> whom they perceive by that ſenſible correſpondence he keepeth with their heart within, by thoſe violent inroads, importunate ſolicitations, thoſe impetuous motions, wherewith they are ſo ſtrangely hurried, and oft driven over light, and judgment, yea, over their ſtrongeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, ſo as he may be as diſcernable to them, and that there is ſomething therein beſide themſelves, as if they converſed with him in an outward viſible ſhape.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſince the time when they begun to look after God, and to know any thing of his work upon their ſpirits, they have been acquainted with moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighting, dreadful <hi>temptations,</hi> and do now perceive his rage, and violent purſuit to bring them back, which they knew not before, when at peace with their idols and ſinful way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the mark he levelleth at, to which his uſual temptations have a tendency, is their <hi>ſoul</hi> and inward man, to hinder communion with God, and to turn their heart off from him, to break the Law, and lay aſide commanded duties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That his ordinary approaches to the heart are oft by a very <hi>ſmall</hi> thing: he needs no more but an open door, or a ſinful look for the diſpatch of a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and knoweth by a wound in the eye, how to carry death in unto the ſoul.</p>

                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:005185_0085_1016D9B7D9197DC8"/>
5. That he is ſuch a party as knoweth his <hi>time</hi> and opportunity, can change his weapons, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> buſk the hook with divers baits, and yet he is always at hand, when the heart is lifted up, when they are out of their duty, and in a carnal frame, to ſet in then with ſome temptation, and fiſh in ſuch a troubled water.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That his way doth truly anſwer his name, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wickedneſs in high places;</hi> this being ſo diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by daily experience, that he hath the advantage of the ground, is a moſt ſubtile obſerving adverſary, who lieth in the dark to us, while we are in the light to him, and knoweth how to correſpond with our corruption, and to ſuit his temptation to our natural temper (wherewith he is well acquainted) and to our calling, and our company, to the preſent ſtrait, to our predominant inclination, and to our retirement and ſolitude; yea, that he is one who knoweth how to follow in, and play with ſuch a gale, when we are in hot blood, or in any diſtemper and diſcompoſure of ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That he can <hi>transform himſelf into an Angel of light,</hi> and ſute his temptations to the ſpiritual exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and enjoyments of the ſaints; that there are temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on the right hand as well as the left, which are ſo refined, and ſo like a Chriſtian exerciſe, that they can ſcarcely diſcern the weed from the flower, and moſt dreadful errors from the choiceſt truths, to which they oft have a great reſemblance; though at laſt it doth appear that the native tendency even of the moſt ſpecious errors in the judgment, is to looſneſs in practice, and to make men religiouſly irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That he is alſo a <hi>roaring lion;</hi> which they have oft proved by dreadful blaſphemous injections, theſe <hi>fiery darts</hi> which are thrown in with violence, wherewith there is no concurrence of the inclination or conſent, but a diſcernable force put upon them,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005185_0086_1016DA0552288388"/>
aſſaulting them with moſt horrid Atheiſtical thot's, even while their heart doth riſe with abhorrence, and enter their diſſent againſt the ſame.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That he is a moſt <hi>reſtleſs</hi> adverſary; who is <hi>going ſtill about,</hi> and giveth no ceſſation, but with purpoſe to return at ſome greater advantage; and is no leſs terrible in his flight, than in his aſſault; and that he can ſpeak out of a friend, as well as out of a foe; yea, and doth then moſt dangerouſly tempt, when the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is leaſt ſeen or diſcovered.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That his temptations do not only drive at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging of the heart to bring ſin to the thought, but alſo the bringing it forth to the <hi>act,</hi> for putting ſome blot upon their walk and converſation.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That he is one who is overcome by <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> and doth <hi>flee</hi> before thoſe that withſtand him; which they have oft proved, that they have returned from prayer with the ſpoyl of their adverſary, and at ſuch a time have been made to wonder, how that which hath oft foyled them, ſhould have been their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="13">13. They alſo find by frequent obſervation, that though he is moſt ſubtile, being indeed one who through long experience and continued practice hath attained a great deal of dexterity in tempting; yet, he hath <hi>one uſual method,</hi> and ſuch device which the ſerious Chriſtian, by daily experience and watchfulneſs, may eaſily diſcern, and perceive his temptations in their riſe, and at a diſtance while they are, as it were, creeping up the wall: yea, thus in ſome meaſure he may find out the <hi>depths of Satan,</hi> and know how to avoid the net ſpread by that great fowler.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>That the promiſes of the Word which are held forth to the Godly,</hi> for their uſe and encouragement while they are in the way, <hi>have a certain accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:005185_0087_1016D9B9714D8560"/>
and are a ſafe ground to adventure upon, and worthy to be credited, is a truth tried in all ages; whereto experience of the ſaints can give a large teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>Now in ſpeaking to this grave ſubject, it is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſpeak any thing of the nature and diverſe kinds of promiſes, nor whence it is that we live at ſo poor a rate and ſo uncomfortably, while ſuch as well as this is at our hand. For it's eaſy to read the cauſe within ourſelves, we <hi>ſow ſparingly,</hi> and venture little out, therefore we have ſo ſmall an increaſe; there is a <hi>price for wiſdom,</hi> but it is <hi>in the hands of fools,</hi> who <hi>have no heart thereto.</hi> But this doth not concern us here; for I only aim to hold out this, that the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which God hath given his People in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are of unqueſtionable verity, and have as real and ſure performance in the ſaints experience, as they are ſure of that which cometh moſt neceſſarily to paſs by the work and concurrence of natural cauſes, as that the fire doth burn when combuſtible matter is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or the ſun riſe after its going down. For indeed this truth is ſo manifeſt, proved by ſuch innumerable experiments, amidſt the various changes of a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian's condition, that we might ſummon as many witneſſes as have been followers of God in the World, which are not a few, who in all ages have put the promiſes to an eſſay, and ſet their ſeal that God is true. Yea, to aſk at ſuch, if they know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a truth in Scripture-promiſes, that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not to paſs, I think were to enquire at a living man, whither he ſeeth and feeleth, or if there he ſuch a thing as motion, ſince they have as ſure and ſenſible a demonſtration of the one, as he hath of the other.</p>

                  </gap>ere I ſpeak any thing particularly to this, I would firſt premiſe ſome things, to clear what we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

here, by the ſaints <hi>experience</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of the promiſes, in theſe following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We would conſider, though the Scripture hath here it's accompliſhment, and is intended for the uſe of the Church, and every particular Chriſtian, while on the way in his militant condition, yet there are <hi>ſome promiſes</hi> of the Word (yea, the greateſt) which belong to the ſaints, that will <hi>not</hi> be fulfilled, until they have <hi>caſt off their armour,</hi> and are called to divide the ſpoil: their experience of which, will be the <hi>high prize of the calling of God in Chriſt,</hi> whereof, all which they now enjoy, is but an earneſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We would conſider that the great <hi>intent</hi> of the Scripture, and promiſes thereof, is not for contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, but that we may know them by <hi>experience,</hi> and drive a bleſſed trade and commerce therewith; <hi>the merchandize of which is better nor that of gold:</hi> for here lieth the Chriſtian's life in the World, yea, it is a great part of their <hi>talent,</hi> the promiſes, which are not to be laid up in their heart and memory, as <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> a napkin,</hi> but they muſt give an account what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience they have <hi>gained</hi> thereby, and thus the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hand ſhould make rich.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What ever be the different ſizes, and degrees of experience among the ſaints, according to their growth and age in Chriſt, yet it is certain that the meaneſt who have intereſt in the promiſes, and did ever embrace them in earneſt, and put them to trial, muſt know ſomething of the performance of the ſame in <hi>their own</hi> caſe; for the Lord doth not ſuffer his work in his People to want a ſeal.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The godly's experience hereof, is then much made out, when they are much in <hi>obſervation;</hi> and we know little of the truth and performance of the promiſes, becauſe we are not more habitually in a frame to obſerve. Thus he <hi>goeth by,</hi> and <hi>we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not;</hi> but they never wanted confirmations,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005185_0089_1016D9BE72A63790"/>
who were ſeriouſly ſeeking to be confirmed in the truth of the Word.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ſpecial mercies and providences of a Chriſtian life, are a certain <hi>return</hi> of the promiſe, and in that way do meet them, as the proper channel of their conveyance; for they are the <hi>ſure mercies of the Covenant:</hi> and how refreſhful is it, that all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral caſes of the Saints, their meaneſt as well as their greateſt neceſſities, and their outgate or relief are comprehended in the Word, and under ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and were all foreſeen in his everlaſting view, who hath ſo marvellouſly ſuited the ſame to all that his People ſtand in need of, as if it had been directed to ſuch and ſuch a Chriſtian only!</p>
               <p n="6">6. This helpeth to make the mercies of the godly man to have a <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>ſweet reliſh,</hi> and to be ſome way twice his mercy, when he gets them in ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate a way reached to him as it were out of the promiſe, and as an obſervable return from Heaven; when thus the Lord <hi>ſealeth</hi> his Word to him by his work, and the way of the Word he findeth hath been the way of his comfortable Relief; that when he hath had no other eſcape, but to turn in to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and to caſt himſelf upon it, he gained this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, <hi>he truſted in God, and was helped;</hi> and can give in this teſtimony of him, that <hi>he hath both ſpoken it,</hi> and <hi>himſelf alſo hath done it,</hi> according to his Word.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is <hi>not</hi> any <hi>extraordinary</hi> thing, we here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, by the Chriſtian man's experience of the truth of the promiſes; it is not a <hi>rapture</hi> or <hi>revelation,</hi> or ſuch as ſome of the Saints have upon ſome <hi>ſingular</hi> and <hi>ſpecial</hi> account had; for we have not any <hi>promiſe</hi> for theſe things: But it is ſomething well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the <hi>Word,</hi> which conſtantly holdeth in the Lord's <hi>ordinary-way</hi> of procedure with his People, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of the Covenant. For <hi>his Word,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005185_0090_1016DA0E649A1E00"/>
doth good to them that walk uprightly;</hi> and doth certainly take place in the experience of every ſerious and diligent Chriſtian.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This is not the teſtimony of a few, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of <hi>all</hi> the Saints ſince the beginning, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth all moſt harmoniouſly agree, and bear <hi>one witneſs,</hi> that <hi>he is faithful who hath promiſed;</hi> &amp; it is not that which a Chriſtian hath found once or twice in his life, but the <hi>daily</hi> food of ſuch as live by faith.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This doth put a ſtrong obligation on the godly man to the Word, <hi>for the time to come;</hi> for theſe who have tryed it often, may with much confidence truſt it in the day of their ſtrait.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The experience which the godly hath of the real performance of the promiſes, is a moſt convinicng <hi>evidence of his ſtate in Chriſt.</hi> It is the earneſt and pledge of the inheritance, and full accompliſhment of that which remaineth; that <hi>the Lord will perfect what concerneth him,</hi> who <hi>hath been his help hitherto;</hi> and will be <hi>his exceeding great reward</hi> in the end, who hath made him find ſo much of the <hi>gain of godlineſs</hi> here by the way.</p>
               <p>Now having premiſed theſe things, I ſhall here inſtance ſome <hi>particular promiſes,</hi> wherein the Chriſtian's moſt uſual trade and commerce doth lie, and to which they give in their ſeal and witneſs. I confeſs, if all theſe proofs which the Saints have had, of the fulfilling of the promiſes, could be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, we might make uſe of that Divine hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole, <hi>The World could not contain the books that ſhould be written thereof.</hi> O what an admirable volume, what an excellent commentary, and copy ſhould this be of the Scripture, to ſee it thus turned over into the experience of every Chriſtian! It would be ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

drops and emanations of love, theſe ſenſible returns and accompliſhments of the promiſe, which they have had in their experience. I truely think, it could hardly be believed, though it were told, what ſome of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here have found in the way of the Word: but it is ſufficient, to anſwer the deſign of this work, to ſhew that there is a ſenſible demonſtration and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Scripture-promiſes, concerning which the experience of the Saints in all ages doth agree; that by many confirmations the Lord hath oft ſealed the truth thereof to their ſouls.</p>
               <p>There are 10 <hi>ſpecial promiſes,</hi> held forth to the godly in the Word, which I ſhall here inſtance, and therewith hold forth what a clear teſtimony their experience can give, of the undoubted truth and accompliſhment of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST Inſtance, is that promiſe given to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> to ſuch who credit the <hi>naked word,</hi> when there is no probable appearance of its fulfilling, and thus give God the glory of his faithfulneſs; which we have expreſly held out, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 20. <hi>Ps.</hi> 112. 7. 8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 50.</p>
               <p>To clear the accompliſhment of this promiſe, I ſhall but appeal to that teſtimony the ſaints in all ages have left thereof; yea, to the preſent experience of the godly at this day, if they have not certainly found it ſo—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That when in a particular they have truſted God therewith, and got their ſpirit quiet in a recumbency on him, he hath dealt with them according to his word; yea, if then from clear convincing returns of the promiſe, they have not been made to ſay, it did never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them, that they gave more credit to the teſtimony of God, than of their own hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they have not found a more ſweet and obſervable iſſue, than when their help lay moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:005185_0092_1016DA0FF2B27078"/>
on the word alone; never a more comfortable Relief than when leaſt of ſenſe and moſt of faith was in carrying them through, when little of the creature and much of God appeared in their mercy, and when they were at the loweſt, having no way of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape but to throw themſelves on the promiſe, they have then had the beſt retreat, yea, their ſupply as ſenſibly felt, as their need and burden had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That their greateſt difficulties and ſhakings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the promiſe, have helped to their further confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eſtabliſhment: ſo as they can ſay, the Lord's way, by perplexing them firſt, yea, to their ſenſe loſing their Hold, hath helped to faſten it better; and that which for the time did ſpeak their caſe moſt helpleſs, hath made way for his more eminent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and manifeſting of himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That their greateſt venture, and giving moſt out, hath uſually had the richeſt income: the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent experiences of their life have followed the moſt adventurous acts of their faith; yea, upon an after-reckoning they have oft found, that their adventuring of life, eſtate, and credit on the promiſe of God, even in theſe things, hath very obſervably been their Advantage.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That where they have moſt been a friend to their faith, there hath faith alſo been moſt a friend to them: in their ſtanding to the credit of the promiſe, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed by the greateſt objections and falſe reports raiſed thereof, they have found a very evident mark of God's reſpect to the ſame, cauſing them to ſee, that he will honour ſuch who thus honour him. And it is indeed worthy of a remark, what we have of <hi>Caleb</hi> upon record, that he took part with the promiſe of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that diſcouraging report which then was raiſed of the <hi>Anakims,</hi> and their walled cities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inheritance of the Children of <hi>Anak</hi> was
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:005185_0093_1016D9C524B66C18"/>
given to <hi>Caleb</hi> and his ſons, in their lot from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That believing doth always make way for ſenſe, and in their cloſing with the naked Word of promiſes, they have not wanted the ſeal of the Spirit of promiſe; but have found a ſweet-calm, their burden ſenſibly caſed, when once they got it ſaid over on the word, which they can ſay hath been their firſt reſting place, like the very fixing of the motion of the needle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards its right point, when their ſpirit had been reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and in greateſt agitation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That the greateſt diſappointments, which their hope in the Word ſeemed to have, they have found afterwards moſt to their advantage; when their returns have not only been according to their faith, but have often exceeded their adventure, and been far beyond what they believed: yea that from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent experience they may ſay, the iſſue of truſting the Word, how long ſo ever they thought it deſerted, yet came always in ſeaſon, was never too late and out of time.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That this did never occaſion bitter reflexions, or was their reproach before the World, that they truſted God in a day of ſtrait and were not helped: but this teſtimony have all ſuch left, who have moſt credited it in a diſmal hour, that none ſhould fear after them to hazard upon ſuch a hand and venture on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; for their faith hath oft carry'd them well and comfortably through, where both ſenſe and reaſon have been ready to ſink.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SECOND Inſtance,</hi> Whereby we may ſee the performance of the promiſe in Chriſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> experience, is this, <hi>That God truly heareth prayer;</hi> is near unto his People in what they call upon him for, agreeable to his Word, and will anſwer their deſires; we have this

               <p>Now the accompliſhing of this part of Scripture is ſo very clear, that I can atteſt the experience of all <hi>the generation of the righteous,</hi> ſince the beginning, what frequent and unanſwerable confirmations they have got of this truth in their Chriſtian walk: ſo that I am ſure, no man ever was in earneſt in the matter of Religion, and a ſtranger to this; yea, that he was never more certainly perſwaded of any thing, than of this, that God doth hear prayer. O if men's ſouls were but <hi>in their ſouls ſtead,</hi> whoſe evening-wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlings and tears the Lord hath oft turned into a morning-ſong, they would know this is no deluſion. I ſhall here touch ſomething of that experience, which by many proofs the ſaints can give, as a witneſs to this promiſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That when they have oft with <hi>Hannah</hi> gone in before the Lord in the bitterneſs of their ſpirit, they have been made to return with a ſenſible and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous change in their caſe; yea, when in going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout prayer, they have been put to wreſtle with much diſtemper and deadneſs, they have oft ſeen the wind diſcernibly change, and therewith their ſpirits light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from under that burden, an obſervable calm and ſerenity following much inward perturbation; yea, they can ſay, that they have found their hearts thawed, and put in a fluſh of tenderneſs, upon the back of a moſt ſenſible reſtraint.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That acceſs and liberty to pour forth their ſouls to God, when he hath filled their mouth with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and inabled them both to wreſtle and wait, they have found a favourable <hi>Criſis,</hi> and begun Relief, yea, the very turn of a ſad caſe, which they have got from the Lord, as the pledge of a further anſwer, and that when he thus <hi>prepareth the heart,</hi> he doth <hi>cauſe his ear to hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:005185_0095_1016D9C6B4E8C108"/>
3. That when they have been under a moſt dark cloud, they have found their ſky clear, have got a very ſenſible taſte of God's acceptation in prayer, and of his taking their ſute off their hand, even while the matter was ſtill in dependance before him; yea, that they have oft had ſuch a ſatisfying impreſſion of God's mind, and perſwaſion of his anſwering their deſire, as hath helped them cheerfully to wait, yea, ſometimes to ſing the triumph before the victory.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That when they had been much in prayer, they muſt alſo ſay, it hath been the time wherein their ſpirit hath flouriſhed, was moſt lively; yea, then they had their beſt days; then <hi>the candle of the Lord ſhined upon their pathes,</hi> and <hi>his dew lay all night upon their branches.</hi> But they have found there is an evident and proportionable abatement of their ſpiritual life and encouragement in God, according to their wearing out in the exerciſe of this duty.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They have many times found, that when there was nothing left them, but to turn in to God, and they knew of no other way to come through, but to pray and look up, they never found a more ſweet and ſeaſonable relief: ſo that moſt obſervable times of prayer have been alſo the moſt obſervable times of their experience; and they can ſay from many proofs, it is no hopeleſs buſineſs, which is put over upon God by prayer, though there be ſmall outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That it is not in vain to follow out a ſute before the throne, but acceſs and intereſt in Heaven is as ſure a way to come ſpeed (which they know well) as greateſt intereſt upon earth; having ſo evidently found, while <hi>many ſeek the ruler's favour,</hi> that the determination of every thing is <hi>from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. That prayer, with quiet waiting in the uſe of means, getteth comfortably through, where over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caring

               <p n="8">8. They know by experience, that as there are judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial times, wherein an inhibition as it were is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p n="9">9. That on the back of ſome ſolemn addreſs and application to God by prayer and faſting in a day of ſtrait, they have oft ſeen cauſe even from that day and upward to date a remarkable return, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in which even common obſervers might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what an evident anſwer the Church's interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with God in times of extremity hath had.</p>
               <p n="10">10. I may add, the ſaints know this ſo well by experience that ſurely God heareth prayer, even in ſuch and ſuch a particular, that they can with much confidence adventure, and make an errand of the meaneſt, as well as their greateſt concernments to him; having ſo oft tried, and found that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and ſincerity in addreſs to God was never in vain, but what ever be the times, therein this promiſe taketh place, <hi>your heart ſhall live, that ſeek God.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That which cauſeth ſo <hi>real a change</hi> upon them, which maketh them <hi>alive to God,</hi> who once were dead, creating them as it were of new, that which bringeth a clod of earth ſo near Heaven, raiſeth ſo far above themſelves to a delightful converſe with things not ſeen, that while their place and abode is here, their company and fellowſhip is above; that which maketh all things new to them and doth ſo far change their nature and inclination, as cauſeth them to find more ſweetneſs in a ſpiritual life, than in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin, yea, reconcileth them with the Law, and exerciſes of a Chriſtian, where once there was ſuch contrariety: Oh! is not this a real effect of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and no imaginary thing!</p>
               <p n="2">2. That whereof they were altogether ignorant, when they were ſtrangers to God, and <hi>knew not if there were a Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but by report, now ſince their being born again they find themſelves entred in another World, <hi>brought out of darkneſs unto a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light,</hi> and of this are ſure, that once they were blind, but now they ſee, is not this a proof of the truth of this promiſe?</p>
               <p n="3">3. That which maketh them ſee more of God in his <hi>Wood,</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> at one time than at another; whence is this difference and inequality, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are at one time <hi>the great things of God's Law,</hi> which are at an other time, but common things to them! the object is the ſame, but O! what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

               <p n="4">4. That which maketh ſuch ſenſible liberty in their ſoul, and <hi>confidence</hi> in their approach to God, after ſore bondage and fear; which raiſeth them often ſo far above their ordinary frame as they are not only quickned and refreſhed themſelves, but do obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably <hi>warm others.</hi> O how piercing, and ſavory are their words, which ſhew what difference there is oft, betwixt a Chriſtian, and himſelf, betwixt a dead exerciſe of a gift which reacheth the ear, and that which melteth the heart, and doth even reach by-ſtanders, with a pleaſant perfume!</p>

                  <hi>FOURTH Inſtance, is that Promiſe for Direction,</hi> which God hath given his People in the Word; that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e will <hi>guide them with his Counſel,</hi> will <hi>order</hi> and <hi>direct their ſteps,</hi> who do commit their way, to him, and <hi>teach them the way that they ſhall chooſe, Pſal.</hi> 37. 5. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 25. 9. 14. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 74. 24.</p>
               <p>The fulfilling of which hath been ſo manifeſt to thoſe who ever made earneſt of acknowledging God in their ways, and committing the conduct thereof to him, that I ſhall but atteſt their experience, if they have not this teſtimony to give—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That to truſt God with their caſe, and give him the guiding of their way, hath carried them much more <hi>eaſily</hi> through a plunging caſe, than overcaring anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety; yea, the Lord's directing their ſteps, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king things ſucceſsful, when they have committed the ſame to him, hath been often as <hi>ſenſible</hi> to them, as their ſtrait and difficulty was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the way of the <hi>word</hi> hath been the beſt expedient for carrying them ſafe and comfortably through; and that they never repented, that they did more conſult their <hi>duty,</hi> than inclination, when they were at a ſtand about a particular, and did not debate the command, even while there ſeemed <hi>a lion in the way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That they were <hi>never left without</hi> counſel and direction, when <hi>their eye was ſingle,</hi> and <hi>ſerious</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; and that it was not ſo much want of light, as of an heart to cloſe therewith, that made their way oft ſo dark: but when they ſubjected themſelves to God's

mind, they found, that ſuch who follow him, ſhall not walk in darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That light and counſel doth meet men in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the command, and the <hi>practice</hi> of known du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hath helped them to <hi>know more</hi> their duty; and that light did moſt abound, when it was moſt their ſerious ſtudy to follow the ſame.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They found, it was never in vain, to enquire after God's mind by <hi>prayer,</hi> and alſo in the <hi>temple</hi> to make a reference of a particular to him, when it was too hard for them; but have often ſeen the Word evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>directed</hi> to ſuch and ſuch a caſe, as if they had got a return from Heaven by an audible voice.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They alſo know, that God's following in light with a powerful impreſſion, his <hi>teaching the reins,</hi> and <hi>inſtructing with a ſtrong hand</hi> is no deluſion, but the ſure and well grounded experience of moſt ſolid Chriſtians in all ages; yea, moſt diſcernable from any falſe impulſe: and that ſome ſpecial piece of work and ſervice, which God hath laid in their Way, wants not uſually ſome <hi>ſpecial call,</hi> backed with ſuch light and authority, as in an irreſiſtable way can anſwer all objections, to make them <hi>go bound in the Spirit,</hi> about ſuch a duty.</p>
               <p n="7">7. How God's ſpecial directing hand hath been o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t very obſervable, not only in preventing and <hi>croſſing their way,</hi> to withdraw them by ſome ſharp diſpenſation, from their purpoſe; but ſenſibly <hi>ever-powering them,</hi> ſo that they have been plucked as it were back, from unavoidable hazard, that they could not find their paths.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I ſhall add, they have oft obſervably found, how eaſy their way was made to them when the Lord doth <hi>countenance</hi> and proſper the ſame: what ſweet concurrence of providences; how then difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have moſt ſenſibly been taken out of the way, yea, wind, and tide going along with them, in ſuch a
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:005185_0102_1016DA68F94E4DA8"/>
manner, that they have been forced to ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a divine hand therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIFTH Inſtance, is the promiſe of Pardon,</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> which God hath given his People in the Word: that for his names ſake he will <hi>blot out their iniquity,</hi> and <hi>remember their ſin no more;</hi> yea, is <hi>ready to pardon;</hi> which is expreſly held forth, to thoſe who are truly humbled. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34 <hi>Iſ.</hi> 43. 25.</p>
               <p>Now that there is a real accompliſhment of this, I am ſure, the experience of the ſaints can in all ages clearly witneſs; what joy and peace this hath occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, what a ſenſible demonſtration and ſolemn confirmations they have had of this promiſe, ſo as their very bones might ſing; <hi>Who is like unto thee, O Lord!</hi> It is true real pardon doth not always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>ſenſible</hi> feeling thereof; and when Sin is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Heaven, there is not always a declaration of it in the <hi>conſcience.</hi> But it is alſo ſure, that this is ſenſibly felt, and that it is tryed by all, even <hi>all the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the righteous,</hi> to have had as powerful an operation on a diſquieted troubled ſoul, as ever wine or the choiceſt cordial could have on the ſick, or faint. O! if thoſe who queſtion this, were in their caſe, to whom <hi>God ſpeaketh peace</hi> after a ſtorm, they would know how real and certain that is! I would offer the Chriſtians witneſs to this promiſe, from many, many experiments, by which the Lord hath ſealed it to their ſoul, whereby they know aſſuredly it is no fancy or deluſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How this hath as ſenſible a <hi>connexion</hi> with the ſerious exerciſe of contrition and repentance, in their experience, as it certainly hath in the word and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; while they find, that in ſilence and keeping up their caſe from God, their bones have been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, their ſpirit in a reſtleſs and diſquieted condition,

until once they made an addreſs, and got their ſoul vented by confeſſing to the Lord, which was then like a kindly turn and cool of a fever.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They know it is no deluſion, that is found ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a <hi>cure</hi> to a <hi>wounded ſpirit,</hi> under the ſenſe of ſin; a wound which the world and all its diverſions could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heal; whoſe pain and grief no muſick can allay (a drop of divine diſpleaſure being enough to turn all their pleaſures into wormwood and gall) but O! a taſte of this unſpeakable cordial, one warming look of a reconciled God, they know by experience, can give preſent eaſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is no deluſion, which they <hi>can not command;</hi> no more, than the ſun to ſhine when overclouded, or the wind to blow, but when it li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. It muſt be no deluſion, which cauſeth ſo marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a <hi>change,</hi> that after greateſt diſquieting <hi>fears</hi> they have found moſt ſenſible <hi>manifeſtations</hi> of love; the greateſt flood on the back of the loweſt ebb in their ſpiritual condition; which oft hath forced them to retract, what their fears and jealouſies did utter; yea, hath made them enquire with wonder, whence they are ſo chearful to day, who yeſternight were ſo broken and cruſht? whence their ſpirit ſhould be in ſo ſweet a calm, that ſo lately was like the raging and troubled ſea?</p>
               <p n="5">5. That this hath oft met them, as a bleſt <hi>ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal</hi> and unexpected welcome, when they have in a <hi>backſliding</hi> caſe come in to God, they certainly
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005185_0104_1016DA6AA7962BA8"/>
know: that when they knew not how to adventure, and at what end of their raveled condition to begin, counts having run long over; yet on their very firſt addreſs, have got a ſweet diſappointment to their fears, been helped to their feet, yea, ſome times have had as it were the <hi>fatted calf</hi> killed, to make merry with their friends.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That which hath an audible voice within, ſo ſtrong an <hi>impreſſion upon the ſoul,</hi> which carrieth with it ſuch a clear ſatisfying diſcovery of God's heart and love, is ſurely no deluſion; while the intimation of that one truth, <hi>Your ſins are forgiven,</hi> or any other word of promiſe for that end, they have found to be an argument beyond words, which they could not reſiſt, but for the time have been as ſure, they ſee and feel this, as that they live; yea, can no more now call it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now that this promiſe is a truth, and hath a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain accompliſhment, the experience of the Saints in all ages will witneſs: and we know their teſtimony is true. What at ſolemn times of God's preſence they have had in a barren wilderneſs, how great a cloud of witneſſes doth ſeal this, and give their teſtimony to <hi>the Croſs of Chriſt!</hi> Of which we may ſay, the fame and ſweet favour hath gone forth, and ſpread abroad through the Church; the Fathers have told it to the Children, and one generation to another: but how little a part thereof can be expreſſed! I think, it would be a marvellous record, if the ſuffering, and priſon experiments of the Saints were particularly ſet down, what they have found under the croſs. But it is well, we know this promiſe hath been, and this day is evidently ſealed; concerning which I dare atteſt the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:005185_0106_1016DA6DC94A6330"/>
experience of as many as did ever drink of this bleſſed cup, and were counted worthy to ſuffer for the teſtimony of Chriſt, if this be not a faithful and true witneſs—</p>
               <p>Firſt, that they have oft <hi>taſted what communion with God is,</hi> in the ſecret duties of a Chriſtian, alſo in the publick ordinances, and in a ſpecial meaſure, at ſome more ſolemn times; but, O! never knew his preſence and communion with him more ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly than under the Croſs: yea, have found that the work and ſervice of a ſuffering-time, as it is not the ordinary Service of every day, hath alſo a peculiar and more than ordinary allowance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they never knew <hi>divine ſtrength</hi> more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, than when they have been moſt <hi>preſſed above their own ſtrength:</hi> that in the day they were caſt on God's immediate care, and ordinary means of their help moſt withdrawn, they had never leſs cauſe to complain, but might often ſay this as their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>they thirſted not when he led them through the wilderneſs;</hi> yea, that they have at no time of their life, found their mercies more obſervably attend them, nor more ſweet and ſatisfying, than when by prayer and believing, they were put to dig the well, and wait for the rain coming down to fill it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they never found more true <hi>liberty,</hi> than in the <hi>houſe of bondage:</hi> more refreſhing company, than amidſt their greateſt ſolitude; while they found Him near, whom gates and bars cannot ſhut out: in the day when all things elſe ſeemed to frown upon them, that their <hi>midnight-ſongs</hi> have been ſweeter, than all the proſperity they ſometimes enjoyed; and that they have oft proved, that the deeper any are in affliction for Chriſt and his truth, they are alſo the deeper in conſolation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They muſt ſay, the moſt ſatisfying and clear diſcoveries of the <hi>word</hi> are under ſearching and ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005185_0107_1016DA25755899D8"/>
                  <hi>trials;</hi> that a ſanctified exerciſing affliction, they have found one of the beſt <hi>interpreters</hi> of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the word <hi>then</hi> to be an other thing, than it is at other times; yea, even to have been that to them, which they could deſire it to be, ſo as they are ſure it hath been ſhaped out and directed for that preſent plunge their ſoul was in.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That there is a very <hi>eaſy paſſage</hi> and <hi>diſpatch,</hi> betwixt <hi>Heaven</hi> and an oppreſſed <hi>afflicted ſoul,</hi> an obſervable vent by prayer, and more ſenſible acceſs to God's face, when other things have moſt frowned; yea, they can witneſs from experience that <hi>he ſtayeth his rough wind in the day of his Eaſt wind:</hi> that while he ſhutteth one door, he hath ſet an other open; that when the ſtorm without hath been very ſharp, they have found a ſweet calm and ſun-ſhine within, to make it eaſy; and that when he layeth on one ſore trial, he will take an other off.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They can tell what a ſweet comfortable <hi>parting,</hi> they have oft had, with ſome ſharp <hi>trial;</hi> which at the firſt was bitter as death, but in the cloſe, after ſanctified exerciſe under the ſame, they have found cauſe to leave it their bleſſing, and confeſs, that the time of greateſt jealouſy and fear upon their part, they have found on God's part hath been a time of greateſt kindneſs and love; the ſharpeſt wounds from ſuch an hand and heart as his, have tended to a cure; yea, that circumſtance and ingredient in the ſame, which of all was moſt bitter and grievous, even there they have found their relief and encouragement moſt remarkable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That the peculiar <hi>advantage</hi> of a ſanctified trial is not ſo well ſeen in the preſent time, as <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> when the caſe hath altered; then they found a long and rough ſtorm recompenced at their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a rich lading of experience; an other kind of diſcovery of God, his way, and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:005185_0108_1016DA71F8573F90"/>
of his word, than they formerly had attained: ſo as now they can ſpeak of him, and the good of the croſs, and adventuring any thing for Chriſt, with ſome greater eſteem, on an other ground, than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or an hearing thereof by the ear.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I ſhall add what hath been the frequent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of thoſe who ever endured tribulation for the goſpel, that their <hi>remembrance</hi> and <hi>after-reckoning</hi> upon this account hath not been <hi>ſad</hi> or <hi>bitter,</hi> when they ſat down and compared their <hi>gain</hi> with their <hi>loſs,</hi> their ſupports &amp; reliefs with theſe days of trial, which have gone over their head: ſo that they would not then exchange their experience, or want what they have found by the <hi>croſs;</hi> no, not for many more days of trouble and affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SEVENTH Inſtance, is that promiſe of the word which integrity, in an evil time hath;</hi> that it ſhall <hi>preſerve their ſteps,</hi> and be the beſt means to help thoſe through, that keep God's way, yea, even in this life ſhall not want ſome witneſs of God's reſpect. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18. 25. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 112. 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p>Now to hold forth the accompliſhment of this, I may with confidence appeal to the obſervation of the ſaints in all ages, who ever made it their ſerious ſtudy to <hi>keep their garments</hi> clean in a time of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, if their experience hath not this teſtimony to give.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that though at preſent, <hi>honeſty</hi> in evil times hath brought them in hazard, and with <hi>Joſeph</hi> to a priſon, yet it hath brought them out alſo, with obſervable <hi>advantage;</hi> yea, how ever the Lord did order their Deliverance, they have found this did land them well, and always bring them to a comfortable harbour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That honeſty and faithfulneſs hath an <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> even on the conſcience of their <hi>enemies,</hi> and
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:005185_0109_1016DA2869518F78"/>
leaveth uſually a conviction upon them: Yea, hath forced a teſtimony and approbation from ſuch men, and they have oft found better entertainment, than thoſe who in a ſinful way have ſought to pleaſe them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have found this integrity always the <hi>choic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expedient</hi> and beſt policy <hi>in</hi> a dangerous time, which hath obſervably met them, when they had moſt to do; A thing whereof they have reaped the fruits <hi>in</hi> the day of their ſtrait, and times of judgment; yea, though it hath <hi>occaſioned</hi> ſometime their ſufferings, yet it hath been alſo their ſafety and protection from ſadder ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That though integrity is oft under a dark cloud of reproach, yet it ſtill getteth well out from under the ſame, and hath ſhined uſually <hi>more bright</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: So as they have had cauſe to obſerve, what unexpected means the Lord hath made uſe of, for their clearing.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That while their <hi>enemies</hi> might have (were it not for the preventing goodneſs of God) quarrelled upon ſome <hi>other</hi> ground, they have been obſervably led to purſue, and make them the Butt of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, for their honeſty, and that wherein they have peace before God, and have been kept from hitting on the <hi>right</hi> cauſe.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They find how unſpeakably <hi>ſweet</hi> this is upon an <hi>after-reckoning,</hi> and in the <hi>evening of their life,</hi> that then they reap a comfortable harveſt, of that they have ſown with much ſuffering and tears. O! then it doth not repent them, that <hi>integrity</hi> was their choice.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They have ſometime found a <hi>hundred-fold</hi> even in <hi>this life;</hi> and an obſervable gain in that, which they have been willing to riſk and hazard moſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They muſt alſo ſay, integrity was <hi>never their ruin;</hi> but an eſcape was oft brought about in a way
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:005185_0110_1016DA7387940870"/>
they could not have expected; yea, the Lord's ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all other doors upon them hath been, that he might open one himſelf, like <hi>Hagar's</hi> well ſpringing up in the wilderneſs.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That in making their aim, when they had a large heart for God, they have not then wanted an <hi>opportunity</hi> for <hi>evidencing</hi> the ſame; their encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement hath abounded with their duty; and they have got much <hi>in,</hi> in giving much <hi>out</hi> for Chriſt; that there was no ſuch <hi>feaſt</hi> in the world, as they have ſenſibly found in the teſtimony of a <hi>good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>EIGHTH Inſtance is that promiſe,</hi> which is held forth to the Chriſtian in the word, <hi>of ſtrength and aſſiſtance to go about duties. Iſ.</hi> 40. 29. 30. 31. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 18. 6. 14. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 84. 5. <hi>Pſ</hi> 68. 28.</p>
               <p>To clear this, that it hath an unqueſtionable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, I atteſt the experience of <hi>the generation of the righteous.</hi> Who ever knew what it was to <hi>ſerve the Lord in the ſpirit;</hi> and by many ſenſible confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, have not prov'd the certainty of theſe things?</p>
               <p>Firſt, that when they have gone about duty under much <hi>deadneſs</hi> and ſtraitneſs of ſpirit, they have found a very ſenſible <hi>enlargement,</hi> and got their bonds <hi>leaſed:</hi> which ſurely they could no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, without the concurrence of divine help, and ſomething above nature, than theſe who ſpread out the ſail, can command a fair wind, when it is croſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God's help and concurrence was never more diſcernably carrying them through, and making them ſtrong, then in the day, that (to their own ſenſe) they were moſt <hi>weak,</hi> when they have gone about duty under greateſt fears, and fainting in ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That when they had moſt <hi>confidence in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and judged they were at greateſt advantage in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:005185_0111_1016DA2B6714B708"/>
their going about ſome duty, they have uſually had the ſaddeſt retreat; and found that a ſure truth, <hi>the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They know well what an influence divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence hath, not only upon their inward frame, but alſo upon the exerciſe of their gifts, yea, upon the commoneſt abilities of judgment, and memory; and that there is a moſt remarkable difference, betwixt themſelves at one time, and another, according to the blowing of this wind.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They muſt alſo witneſs this as their experience, they found <hi>duty</hi> never more <hi>eaſy</hi> to them, than when they have had <hi>moſt to do,</hi> and were kept moſt throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and preſſed therein; yea, when much work was laid to their hand, they then wanted not an <hi>enlarged</hi> allowance for the ſame.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That their ſpirits have been <hi>fitted</hi> for duty, and <hi>carried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> difficulties, where at ſome other time and in an other frame they would have <hi>fainted:</hi> and thereby have ſeen, that none needs to ſtart at any piece of duty, when God calleth them to it; for while difficulties have appeared greateſt at firſt, the leſs they have found them afterward, yea, the hardeſt piece of ſervice oft made moſt eaſy.</p>
               <p n="7">7. They find God doth raiſe the ſpirit of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with a ſuitable elevation for their work, and can <hi>fit</hi> them for the ſervice of that time, and other tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als thereof, even beyond their <hi>ordinary reach.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. That there is an <hi>open door,</hi> and ſenſible aſſiſtance, when there hath been <hi>work</hi> for the Goſpel in ſuch a place; while, on the other hand, they have found an inhibition ſenſibly ſerved on them, the <hi>door</hi> as it were <hi>ſhut,</hi> when the tide was going back, and the work of the Goſpel <hi>at a ſtand</hi> in ſuch a part.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That it is not greateſt <hi>abilities,</hi> which make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings <hi>ſucceſsful;</hi> it being <hi>in vain, to riſe up ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:005185_0112_1016DA75AB929638"/>
10. It hath oft been their experience, that in <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the way of God, his candle did then <hi>ſhine upon their paths,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Lord was with them, and ſenſibly poured out: the <hi>withdrawing</hi> whereof hath been no leſs diſcernable, while they <hi>turned aſide</hi> from him; that they have then been put to bear the burden alone, and found difficulty and deſpondency of ſpirit at once growing upon their hand.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I may add, what thoſe who are ſerious in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion have oft tried, that there is no ſuch <hi>help</hi> and <hi>furniture</hi> for going about duties, as a <hi>ſpiritual frame,</hi> and <hi>nearneſs</hi> with God: for then light, and counſel, inward freedom, and ſweet compoſure of ſpirit, have brought moſt ſenſible advantage to them: in their greateſt, yea, and in their moſt common undertakings, this hath been very evident.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NINTH Inſtance, is that great promiſe; we have,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. <hi>That all things ſhall work together for good to them who love God.</hi> And Pſal. 25. 10. <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth, to ſuch as keep his Covenant.</hi>—I confeſs, it is not eaſy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to reconcile God's way and this piece of his Word together: thoſe who take only an ordinary paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing view of providence, cannot well judge, how ſuch things, wherewith oft the godly in their life are exerciſed, ſhould contribute to their good and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; while nothing would ſeem more directly croſs to the ſame. But the Chriſtian and wiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver can give another account: they know what a ſure truth this is, that there is no real jarr betwixt the promiſe and providence of God in this matter; and what ever be the preſent thoughts, patient wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath had cauſe to ſay this,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. When <hi>his way</hi> and <hi>their thoughts</hi> have moſt <hi>differed,</hi> in the accompliſhment of his Word and bringing about their mercy, they have found it was
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:005185_0113_1016DA30B5757490"/>
to their <hi>advantage;</hi> that his choice was always better then theirs; yea, they have been oft made to confeſs, that their ſaddeſt diſappointments therein have tended to their further Benefit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Lord's <hi>denying</hi> them ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thing, which they have moſt deſired, they have found (as afterwards hath appeared) was to <hi>grant</hi> them more than their deſire; he hath refuſed them as it were in an <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> that he might give them an <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They can oft ſay, they had been <hi>undone,</hi> if they had <hi>not</hi> been undone; that it was their mercy, the Lord took ſuch a way to caſt them in a <hi>fever,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a <hi>lethargy;</hi> and by ſome ſharp croſs gave them a wound in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> to cure and let out ſome groſs impoſtume in their <hi>ſoul,</hi> which would have made their caſe worſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. How <hi>greateſt ſhakings</hi> have helped their <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtabliſhment;</hi> ſo as they were never more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, than in that about which they have been moſt perplexed. Yea, they have alſo found this the Lord's way, to cure their frowardneſs and miſbelief by ſome further <hi>addition</hi> to their croſs: that when they would not believe, he hath cauſed them to come in upon a greater diſadvantage; while as a ſmall affliction hath made them impatient, a more heavy and preſſing trouble hath been their cure, and helped them to keep ſilence under God's hand.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the <hi>growing</hi> of difficulties in their way, and ſome <hi>further</hi> preſſure in the trial, they have found was from the Lord in order to its <hi>removal,</hi> and to the bringing forth of ſome <hi>greater</hi> good: and that all viſible grounds of confidence have been oft broken, but with this advantage in the upſhot, that their mercy, they had it more <hi>immediately</hi> out of God's own hand; yea, that the leſs <hi>moderation</hi> there was whilſt their trial hath come to an extremity, they
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:005185_0114_1016DA79ED3CD750"/>
have found it then upon the turn, and their hope and encouragement oft made to ſpring up therewith.</p>
               <p n="6">6. How the Lord's <hi>deferring</hi> their mercy, which they had oft ſought, hath been <hi>indeed</hi> their mercy and advantage, which did always meet them in the ſeaſon; yea, they muſt ſay, his way is always neareſt, and waiting on God without making haſte, doth truly make the quickeſt diſpatch.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their experience can alſo witneſs, how <hi>men's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,</hi> and venting their malice that way to ruin their reputation, hath oft been the occaſion, ordered by the Lord, to bring forth their further <hi>clearing,</hi> and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication even by that very mean.</p>
               <p n="8">8. How by ſome ſad croſs he doth oft <hi>prevent</hi> a <hi>ſadder;</hi> which though ſtrange at firſt, they have been forced upon after-diſcovery to confeſs: The man, who riding in haſte to the ſea-port, to have paſſage over ſeas with a ſhip going then off, fell and broke his leg by the way, which was the ſaving of his life; for the ſhip, and all its paſſengers, periſhed in that voyage; yet this was a bitter aſtoniſhing providence to him for the preſent.</p>
               <p n="9">9. How their <hi>loſs,</hi> even by ſome ſad ſlip and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in their <hi>ſpiritual</hi> condition, hath really tended to their further humbling and advantage; yea, that which brought them under ſome viſible decay, as to the wonted luſtre of their Chriſtian profeſſion hath helped them to grow more under ground, in the root and ſubſtantials of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They can tell how thoſe <hi>ſteps</hi> of the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, which ſeemed moſt <hi>croſs</hi> to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign he was carrying on, yea, looked like the very cruſhing of their <hi>hope,</hi> have oft been the very mean which hath wrought moſt <hi>effectually</hi> to bring about their mercy.</p>
               <p n="11">11. I ſhall add but this, as the Chriſtian's witneſs to the truth of this promiſe; That the ſharpeſt <hi>reproo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="unknown:005185_0115_1016DA324A38D240"/>
have ſeemed the <hi>wounds of a friend,</hi> and moſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>ſtraits</hi> made the mean for their further <hi>enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> how the Lord hath brought them into ſome dark and plunging trial, which then looked like a fearful pit, that he might bring them out with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, <hi>ſet their feet on a rock,</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh their goings;</hi> yea, that in the hotteſt furnace, they loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they might well ſpare, even ſome of their droſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TENTH Inſtance,</hi> is <hi>that general promiſe</hi> made to <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and thoſe who make it their ſerious ſtudy, that it ſhall be great <hi>gain; that verily it ſhall be will with the righteous, for they ſhall eat the fruit of their labour, and in keeping of the command there is a great reward.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 6. 1. Pet. 3. 12, 13. Pſal. 19. 11.</p>
               <p>This is indeed a great concerning truth; but a truth, which, I am ſure, none who did ever make ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of religion, will call in queſtion. Many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing experiments hath the Chriſtian had thereof through his Life: ſuch want not ſome diary and record, wherein they can caſt up the advantage, they have reaped in cloſe following of God and their duty; yea, from moſt remarkable providences they may oft ſay, <hi>This I had, becauſe I kept thy precepts.</hi> Now, that this promiſe hath a large witneſs, I ſhall here touch ſome things, which I may with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence ſay, both in the preſent and in former times have been proved, and ſealed by the ſaints in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they never more effectually conſulted their <hi>good</hi> and advantage, than when they did with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſingleneſs conſult their duty, and leaſt with <hi>fleſh and blood:</hi> they did never more truely <hi>ſeek themſelves,</hi> than in the practice of ſelf-denial; yea, in what they intended God moſt, and leaſt their own private inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,

they have therein found a very ſenſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a ſerious endeavour to <hi>walk before God</hi> acceptably, they have found ſtill the <hi>beſt policy,</hi> even in the <hi>worſt of times;</hi> and have found his way then very ſatisfying, while it was moſt their ſtudy how to pleaſe him: yea, they have been obliged to confeſs, that when the Lord's way was their <hi>choice,</hi> they have found it alſo their <hi>reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They have found more real joy &amp; peace in <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> temptations, than in any thing the temptation <hi>offered;</hi> and in laying their intereſt <hi>at God's feet,</hi> and their will underneath <hi>his,</hi> more than in all their <hi>carnal</hi> enjoyments. O the taſte, and teſtimony of God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation! how ſweet a ſmile is his, in whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance Heaven lieth!</p>
               <p n="4">4. That inward peace and tranquillity of mind, a ſweet calm and compoſure of ſpirit, doth as really attend a <hi>ſpiritual frame</hi> and <hi>walk,</hi> as the ſhadow the body; and their beſt and moſt comfortable days, wherein they have truly walked at liberty, have been when their heart was moſt <hi>ſubject to the Law,</hi> with a ſingle reſpect to the ſame.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Religion and a ſpiritual walk is the beſt friend, even as to a contented and comfortable life here in the World; and that they have then moſt freedom to enjoy <hi>themſelves</hi> and their lot with ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they moſt enjoy <hi>God:</hi> yea, that nearneſs and communion with him tendeth to the ſublimating and refining of their natural ſpirit, and hath been an obſervable help to their very common abilities and parts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That there is truly a reality in the bleſſing, which maketh a <hi>ſmall</hi> thing ſignify <hi>much,</hi> and yield more than greater abundance.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That when they give God their heart, it is then ſweet and matter of ſatisfaction, to obſerve his
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:005185_0117_1016DA3566098898"/>
ways; and the obſervation is very refreſhing, how far the Lord condeſcends to their <hi>deſires,</hi> when they ſum them all up in himſelf, and make him their delight.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of Religion is in the <hi>practice</hi> thereof; and the way to have Religion eaſy, is to be throughly religious. Duty is then ſweet, when men do it from an inward principle; and holineſs would be a more pleaſant work, yea, a reward to its ſelf, if there were leſs mixture of hypocriſy.</p>
               <p n="9">9. That real <hi>humility,</hi> and walking low in their own eyes, and before God, did never loſe to them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and credit from men; but ſelf-abaſement doth obſervably go before lifting up, and true honour followeth ſuch, who leaſt hunt after vain applauſe from the World.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That when they were moſt faithful to obſerve and improve a <hi>little,</hi> then for their encouragement <hi>more</hi> hath been added; and they never wanted matter and motive to be thankful, when opportunities were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and taken hold of for that end: yea, they have found there is a mercy within a mercy, and ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar mercy in every croſs, which is only found and brought forth by the exerciſed ſerious <hi>improver</hi> of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="11">11. That much ſincerity hath alſo much ſenſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſame; ſecret honeſty before <hi>God</hi> hath met them openly before men, and faithfulneſs in Chriſtian freedom purchaſed them more favour and reſpect, even from the worſt, than when they ſtudied moſt to pleaſe them in a ſinful way.</p>
               <p n="12">12. That they never ſaw ſo clearly the gain and real advantage of Godlineſs, &amp; what a difference there is betwixt thoſe that ſerve God, and thoſe that ſerve him not, as in a time of <hi>trouble</hi> and ſtrait; how then tenderneſs in their former walk, and that which they entertained in the morning, doth now meet them at
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:005185_0118_1016DA7FF62488E0"/>
night, and pay them home with advantage in an hour of temptation.</p>
               <p n="13">13. They have been forced to obſerve, that there is an inviſible <hi>guard</hi> about his People in their duty; that the Miniſtry of the Angels towards ſuch is no delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and have oft been made to wonder how hazard within an hair breadth hath been prevented; relief, and help come as betwixt the bridge and the water; how they have been ſenſibly preſerved amidſt greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, while (as it were) an inhibition hath been ſerved upon theſe, that they ſhould come near, but not hurt, and only meet with them, that they might read their preſervation from them.</p>
               <p n="14">14. That an enlarged heart doth meet with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged <hi>allowance;</hi> and bearing burden with <hi>others</hi> of the People of God, hath helped to make their <hi>own</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate burden the lighter.</p>
               <p n="15">15. That real Godlineſs and Religion hath as much in hand, as it may be a reward to its ſelf; which beautifieth the ſoul, and maketh the face and converſation to ſhine with an obſervable luſtre; that guardeth and preſerveth the heart from many vexing croſſes, preventeth ſad ſtrokes and ſorrows, that others are pierced with, who will follow their idols, and the ways of ſin, which are bitter in the cloſe.</p>
               <p>In a word, this is ſurely found, that God is the beſt friend; and when there is peace with him, things without do not offend: but they ſhall then underſtand what it is to be <hi>in league with the beaſts of the field and ſtones of the ground,</hi> having a ſweet agreement with all the providences and diſpenſations that come in their way.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>That the Scripture-Threatnings have alſo a certain accompliſhment,</hi> are found to be ſad earneſt, and do not fall to the ground, the Chriſtian can alſo ſeal from his experience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:005185_0119_1016DA371D9CBFE0"/>
We are not here to underſtand the threatnings of <hi>vindictive wrath</hi> (from which believers are freed in in Chriſt) but of a <hi>fatherly</hi> diſpleaſure, which becauſe of ſin may draw deep, yea, bring forth very dreadful effects, to witneſs that <hi>it is an evil and bitter thing to depart from God,</hi> and that <hi>their own doings ſhall chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them;</hi> and theſe threatnings of the Covenant, <hi>If thy children forſake my Law, I will puniſh their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion with rods, &amp;c. (Pſal.</hi> 89. 30.) are ſure truths, which want not in every time a performance.</p>
               <p>To clear this (ere I ſpeak any thing particularly) I would premiſe ſome things to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>word</hi> is a perpetual rule, which in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time muſt take place; and though <hi>affliction</hi> is a peice of the common miſery of man, yet doth it not ariſe out of the duſt, neither fall out at an adventure, but doth oft viſibly follow the <hi>tract of ſin</hi> (as a Huth-hound<note n="*" place="bottom">A Dog ſo called in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that hath an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſenſe of Smelling.</note>) pointing at ſuch evils as the cauſe, by the ſtroak, and at the truth and fulfilling of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, written upon both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſhould adore his ſoveraignty, whoſe way both in the meaſure and manner of his People's chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement is ſo <hi>various,</hi> as that none can infallibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, what he is to do in ſuch a caſe; I mean, we are not to <hi>limit</hi> the Lord to ſuch a way and method in his working: yet, this we may aſſert and firmly conclude, that not only the threatnings of the word have a performance, but men may alſo have even beforehand ſome more than probable conjecture, yea, a clear diſcovery, what <hi>ſuch a caſe</hi> doth threaten, and what will be the iſſue of a ſinful courſe, by conſidering the Lord's <hi>ordinary</hi> procedure, both with themſelves and others; how ſin hath very ſad effects, and his way in all ages is ſtill <hi>uniform,</hi> agreeing with its ſelf, and with the word.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:005185_0120_1016DA82E2AADCD8"/>
3. Though a <hi>gracious</hi> ſtate doth ſurely priviledge from wrath and condemnation, yet not from afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſad ſtroaks of divine anger becauſe of ſin; for he taketh vengeance on men's inventions, even when he will ſpare the inventors.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Lord doth oft contend with <hi>his People</hi> for their folly and miſcarriages, <hi>more ſeverely</hi> than with others; and will not overlook in <hi>them,</hi> that which he paſſeth by in the <hi>World,</hi> without being a reprover; but when light and love and the Law will not <hi>hedge up their way,</hi> he will <hi>ſet briar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and thorns</hi> before them, yea, ſpeak by chaſtiſement upon their bones, to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw men from their purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is known, how very <hi>deep</hi> the holy Anger of God may draw againſt his children, even ſometimes to purſue them out of the land of the living, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to the grave, with ſome remarkable ſtroak; yea, it hath made them dreadful examples of judgment in this life, for whom he hath accepted an eternal ſacrifice in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I ſhall add, this is the Lord's bleſſed end in making out his threatnings againſt his People, that they ſhould not periſh with the World. O! what a bleſt exchange is it, that the flaming <hi>ſword,</hi> which once ſtood to guard the <hi>tree of life,</hi> doth now ſtand as it were in the way of the ſaints, to keep them from running into the <hi>paths of death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having premiſed theſe things, I ſhall now inſtance ſome <hi>particular evils,</hi> wherewith the godly are ready to be overtaken, which the word doth expreſly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and hold forth the hazard of, both as to outward and ſpiritual ſtroaks, and give in here the Chriſtians witneſs from their experience, in all ages, of the truth of theſe threatnings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST. Security and carnal confidence,</hi> which we find the word doth threaten, is one evil where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Chriſtians are ready to be overtaken; but they
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:005185_0121_1016DA38B7F30750"/>
do alſo know by ſad experience, what <hi>bitter fruit</hi> this brings forth, and that therein the word falleth not to the ground, which is held forth in <hi>Hoſ</hi> 2. 1, 9. <hi>Hoſ</hi> 7. 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that a <hi>ſecure</hi> condition is the uſual <hi>forerunner</hi> of ſome <hi>ſad change;</hi> that when they are moſt <hi>at eaſe</hi> in a dull and dead temper of ſpirit, ſome <hi>ſharp</hi> rouſing diſpenſation is upon the back of it; either a <hi>groſs ſin,</hi> or a <hi>ſearching croſs,</hi> as a thorn in the bed of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, to <hi>drive them to their feet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>ſeldom-reckoning</hi> with conſcience, the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on of counts for ſome time upon their hand, doth <hi>ravel their caſe,</hi> unto a ſad confuſion, and maketh it a bitter and heartleſs work to retire alone, or within themſelves; yea, hath a moſt direct tendency to a further <hi>hardening,</hi> and real deſert of their duty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That when ſecurity and deadneſs groweth <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> it quickly maketh them dry up and wither <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> in the external performance of duty, and in that vigorous lively appearance, which did formerly brighten their walk and carriage before others, ſo as very by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders may read the languiſhing of <hi>grace,</hi> in the dead exerciſe of their <hi>gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That going about duty with moſt <hi>confidence in themſelves</hi> doth uſually give them the moſt clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of their <hi>weakneſs</hi> yea, when they have <hi>leaſt lookt</hi> for any croſs, they have then been ſure to meet with it, with that ſad addition, of being a <hi>ſurprizal</hi> in a ſecure condition: whereas, on the other hand, they may tell what refreſhing diſappointments they have got, where ſome trials have been moſt feared and lookt for.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That ſecure <hi>ſporting</hi> with a <hi>temptation</hi> may ſoon turn to <hi>ſad earneſt;</hi> they have found it very hard to dance about the fire, and not be burnt: and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which at a <hi>diſtance</hi> ſeemed ſmall, upon a nearer <hi>approach</hi> they have found had more bands on their
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:005185_0122_1016DA84D3F60BE0"/>
heart, and was another thing than they could have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the <hi>means,</hi> whereon they have laid <hi>moſt weight,</hi> they have alſo found to have given them the ſaddeſt <hi>diſappointment:</hi> the putting of them in God's room, and out of their own place, hath been the way to cauſe them to miſcarry; yea, to turn their croſs. Whereas they have oft ſeen ſome thing <hi>unexpected,</hi> made the mean of their help, that they might know means are <hi>ordered of the Lord,</hi> and are uſeful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he maketh them ſo.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Their experience can alſo witneſs, that carnal <hi>confidence</hi> deſpiſing the trial at a <hi>diſtance,</hi> is uſually puniſhed with carnal <hi>diffidence</hi> and deſpondency of ſpirit <hi>under</hi> the ſame; one extremity made the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other, like the hot and cold fits of an ague, which do mutually make one the other more intenſe: yea, that their immoderate confidence and expectation of a thing, hath after reſolved in as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate diſcouragement as their ſtroke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SECOND.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtians Unwatchfulneſs</hi> and intermitting in the exerciſe of that ſo neceſſary and commanded duty, we find the Word threateneth, and holdeth forth the hazard thereof, <hi>Leſt ye enter into Temptation,</hi> the verifying whereof their experience can alſo witneſs. Luk. 21. 34. 36. Matth. 26. 41.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is not eaſy to guide their <hi>walk</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, when their guard over the <hi>heart</hi> doth ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; but the giving looſe reins for a little may make ſuch a ſad and large breach, that many (many) days will not eaſily make up: yea, they do alſo know, how a ſenſible withdrawing of the Spirit, and drying up their life and liberty, is the uſual fruit, which <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchfulneſs</hi> brings forth.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="88" facs="unknown:005185_0123_1016DA41A02C1968"/>
2. That this helpeth to make their ſun-ſhines <hi>tranſient,</hi> and cauſeth a low ebb after the greateſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, whilſt they <hi>do not guard</hi> againſt their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar evils; and that uſually there doth haunt ſuch a condition the ſwelling of the <hi>fleſh</hi> (when the <hi>ſpirit</hi> is moſt enlarged) which will ſoon put them as far behind, as they formerly thought themſelves at an advantage.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That when once the heart lieth <hi>open,</hi> it is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeiſed on and made a <hi>prey;</hi> with what a bitter <hi>ſting</hi> doth it return: after it hath taken liberty to <hi>wander?</hi> yea, doth find there is a <hi>ſwift</hi> progreſs, that <hi>ſin</hi> hath from the <hi>thoughts</hi> to the rolling of it to the <hi>imagination,</hi> and thence to the <hi>affection,</hi> wherewith it is more eaſy to engage, than to ſhake this off.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That <hi>unwatchfulneſs</hi> hath oft turned the moſt ſpecial times and opportunities for advantage, to the greateſt <hi>loſs;</hi> which, through their neglect of theſe, hath put them further behind, then they were: it hath turned their <hi>retirement</hi> and ſolitude, to be their ſnare; made the deſert worſe and more dangerous, than the city; and made them find, that <hi>vain thoughts,</hi> the following whereof ſeemeth pleaſant to the mouth, will prove gall and wormwood in the belly; there being no ſadder company, than a man's <hi>ſpirit</hi> let looſe upon it ſelf, whilſt they cannot ſtop that current, whereto they had given a vent.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their experience of this can witneſs that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watchfulneſs</hi> hath an undoubted tendency to <hi>caſt of prayer.</hi> How hard is it, in the evening to <hi>retire</hi> to God, whilſt the heart is <hi>abroad</hi> all the day? To be Religious in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> when men are not ſo in their <hi>walk;</hi> Yea, they do find, that this will bring their diſtemper within, out of doors; to ſome diſorder, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency or paſſion in their words, or outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: a thing, which experience may tell, doth
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:005185_0124_1016DA8A6A855488"/>
wound the ſoul, make a ſad breach in their peace, and doth quickly overcloud the Spirit, and unfit them for communion with God, and going about of ſpiritual duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIRD. To reſtrain Prayer, and neglect calling on God, is an evil alſo which the Word doth threaten,</hi> and hold forth the ſame hazard thereof, as of unwatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, <hi>leſt ye enter into temptation;</hi> yea, that this is even a ſtep to the <hi>caſting off fear,</hi> the Chriſtians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, from frequent trial can witneſs, that this Scripture threatning is true, Matth 26. 41. Job. 15. 4.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they have found this the riſe, which giveth <hi>life</hi> and <hi>increaſe</hi> to their prevailing <hi>evils;</hi> and that corruption then is upon a ſenſible growth, as the lively exerciſe of <hi>prayer</hi> begins to be intermitted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this <hi>weareth out</hi> their ſpiritual <hi>life,</hi> and bringeth a conſumption upon the vital ſpirits of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; ſo that thoſe who ſometime <hi>flouriſhed,</hi> and kept green (as by the <hi>ſcent of water</hi>) that correſpondence, which they had with the fountain of their life, while his <hi>dew</hi> did <hi>lie all night on their branches,</hi> hath through neglect of <hi>prayer</hi> been brought to a poor <hi>ſhadow;</hi> ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſometimes the greatneſs of their loſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper hath been hid from themſelves, yet might be eaſily diſcerned by lookers on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That wearing out of <hi>prayer</hi> and of <hi>delight</hi> therein will quickly make them <hi>diſreliſh</hi> any <hi>other</hi> piece of Religion; put them out of frame to meditate, or to give thanks, or entertain fellowſhip with the Saints; yea, the more lively and ſpiritual theſe are, it maketh them the more a burden and torment to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That wearing out of this is a ſtrong temptation to a <hi>further forbearance,</hi> and will ſenſibly wear them out of any ſenſe of their <hi>need</hi> hereof, and make them ſtrangers to themſelves and to their own caſe:
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:005185_0125_1016DA432E2CE858"/>
ſo that they ſhall find, the leſs they are in this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, the further they ſhall be indiſpoſed; and the fewer errands they have, the leſs felt neceſſity of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Their experience can alſo witneſs, that <hi>little pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> maketh a <hi>heavy burden;</hi> doth multiply their ſtraits; and cauſe their care to grow, as this is abated they muſt then bear their burden alone, and with heavineſs take counſel within themſelves, while they ply not this bleſt tried remedy, to make their requeſts in all things known to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FOURTH. We find the Word doth threaten D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. That in <hi>one day</hi> they may adventure on that, which through moſt of their life they have not got over, but it hath made them go with their back bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed down to the grave: that their giving the Lord's work a <hi>wrong touch,</hi> is one of thoſe things which doth ſcarcely leave them all their time; but, beyond other ſins, they have found this ſtill come up with a bitter and heavy reflexion: yea, in the evening of their life they have found this ſo ſore on their ſpirit, that it could not lie hid or ſilent, but they were forced to witneſs their ſenſe of it before the World, ere they could obtain any eaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this the Lord doth uſually meet, with ſome <hi>ſharp</hi> and <hi>publick reproof,</hi> even before men; that though he pardon his People, yea, give ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible intimation thereof to their ſouls, yet he hath no paſt them, as to ſome viſible mark of his diſpleaſure becauſe of ſuch a thing.</p>

               <p>I ſhall but add, what bitter and ſad experience can tell, how dreadful it is, to give the <hi>conſcience</hi> a blow, which is more eaſily hurt than healed: that delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, adventuring on the occaſion of a temptation, when they would go to the <hi>high prieſt's hall,</hi> without warrant or a call, hath coſt them dear; and they have found that <hi>bold ſinning</hi> doth afterward make <hi>ſaint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</hi>

               <p>(¶) I know, it is by ſerious and experienced Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and by theſe only, that this argument in the meaning thereof can be reached; and it is ſure, ſuch will not debate the ſame, who know the truth, and have it dwelling in them, and on another ground than report, are eſtabliſhed in its certainty. For theſe can witneſs, what ſweet comforting hours they have had with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in a ſad uncomfortable time;
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005185_0129_1016DA4727862618"/>
that he hath both ſpoken, and himſelf alſo hath done it: and ſuch muſt therefore ſeal his word &amp; the truth thereof, becauſe he hath ſealed it on their heart; yea, doth ſo ſurely know, <hi>it is God who worketh all their works in them,</hi> that with their laſt words and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath they have confidence to aſſert this, and commend that excellent ſtudy of godlineſs to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>I know, that with a great many of the World this grave convincing argument of experience hath no weight; for <hi>ſtrangers intermedle not with that joy,</hi> and therefore fancy it a pure fiction, as the only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient and preſervative to their heart from the horror and inexpreſſible torment, which muſt ſeize on them, if the certainty and neceſſity of godlineſs were granted; theſe ſcoff at this excellent thing, as ſome vain conceit or diſtemper, becauſe they would have it ſo. But with ſuch I muſt here crave a ſerious and free communing; yea, in ſo great and concerning a buſineſs muſt obteſt, that they would not ſhut their eyes, but allow reaſon that weight, they would do in any other caſe. O what do you alledge, on what ground do you reject this great witneſs of experience? If you deny it, becauſe you have not <hi>found</hi> it, do not others aſſert this, becauſe they <hi>ſurely know</hi> it? And their aſſertion hath theſe two advantages; (one) that they once had the <hi>ſame</hi> ſentiment and opinion with <hi>you,</hi> which now they reflect on with much <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> (2.) The reality of its <hi>effects</hi> on them proves both the reality of the cauſe, and the excellency thereof. And now if theſe be indeed ſerious, and their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny true, whom you thus challenge, are you not in a ſad and dreadful caſe; ſince you cannot think to lodge together at night, or that your intereſt and theirs will meet in another world, which hath been ſo very oppoſite here by the way! You muſt ſurely part with theſe at death, and land at ſome other port, to

But know aſſuredly, it is not what you jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and if once you paſs (in this deluſion) that great and laſt ſtep betwixt time and eternity, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, oh undone for ever! And ſure, if you admit the authority of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> you cannot debate the Chriſtians experience; while there you have ſo <hi>great a cloud of witneſſes,</hi> who bear that ſame teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; but it is on your ſelf you muſt reflect (not on the truth) that you know ſo little in this way.</p>
               <p>Now, to leave ſome Conviction on the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> of this time, and thoſe who take liberty to <hi>ſcoff</hi> at ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Religion, I would here offer ſome <hi>rational Grounds;</hi> which even to the World and byſtanders may convincingly demonſtrate, if they would but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſame in earneſt, that this teſtimony the Saints do in all ages bear, from their experience, to the truth, can be no cunning device or falſhood, but is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſure. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. That muſt be a <hi>ſure teſtimony,</hi> and is no cheat, if you judge that thoſe who declare the ſame, have the ſenſe of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and have any <hi>truth,</hi> or moral can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. For it is a clear dilemma: either ſuch, whoſe witneſs this is, are impoſtors of the higheſt degree, yea, in Atheiſm and groſs deceit muſt exceed all the world beſide: or, it is true and valid, what they witneſs. Now, for the firſt, I ſhall crave no more in their behalf, but an appeal to your conſcience and ſober thoughts, if you could judge thus of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This teſtimony muſt be ſure, if you but allow thoſe the uſe of judgment and reaſon, who bear it, and do not judge them wholly demented: for it

                  </gap> Sure, one of theſe two muſt hold; if Chriſtians do not experience them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves what they hold out to others, that they are either in the higheſt meaſure <hi>profligate</hi> and <hi>wicked,</hi> even beyond the ordinary rate and depravation of humane nature; or they muſt be under a ſtrange <hi>madneſs</hi> and <hi>delirium.</hi> They muſt either deſign to cheat the World, or themſelves, but though their adverſaries could wiſh to have it ſo, I think their malice will not make them ſo mad, as to own that challenge: and ſince theſe cannot be alledged, I profeſs were I the greateſt <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> who did not own the Scripture, I could not ſeriouſly conſider the way and walk of ſuch who are tender Chriſtians, without aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or conceive how in ſuch a world and ſo many viſible diſadvantages they ſhould be thus engaged, on any other conſideration, than the truth and reality of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do you not ſee, this is their teſtimony, who are willing to be <hi>tried</hi> therein, and <hi>render a reaſon of that hope which is in them?</hi> yea, do in this offer themſelves to trial, and with greateſt ſeriouſneſs obteſt the the world, not to credit implicitly their witneſs, and take it on truſt, but themſelves put it to the moſt exact inquiry and ſearch! And truly, if there be an appeal and reference to men's ſenſe and feeling, which can admit no debate, I know not what ground they have to queſtion this witneſs, until they firſt put it to an <hi>eſſay,</hi> that from <hi>their own</hi> experience they could contradict the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Should you not admit this for a ſure teſtimony if you grant any <hi>moral certainty</hi> of a thing, that there is ſome caſe wherein a <hi>humane</hi> teſtimony can allow no debate, which in this preſent caſe muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable;

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="15">15. Can you debate whether there <hi>are</hi> ſuch Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in the world, yea, <hi>many</hi> ſuch, whoſe <hi>experience</hi> do's witneſs the truth of religion, of whom it muſt be ſaid (<hi>even their enemies being judges</hi>) their being

O muſt it not be a marvelous thing, which hath that dominion over the ſouls, to teach men the practice of <hi>ſelf-denyal;</hi> not only to quit but to chearfully quit their neareſt intereſt, to ſmile on the ſpoilers, to rejoyce in their ſuffering and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to forgive wrongs, and take revenge by good will! this is indeed <hi>above nature,</hi> and is peculiar to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which can alſo turn poyſon to an ontidote and cure, and gain by its greateſt loſſes.</p>

I ſhall but further offer theſe few <hi>queries,</hi> and plead ſo far with the adverſary, that they would, ere they paſs them, have but ſome ſerious thoughts thereon.</p>
               <p>(1.) If there be a <hi>God,</hi> or truth in any <hi>Religion,</hi> is it not with this bleſſed record of the <hi>Scripture</hi> you muſt cloſe, as the alone <hi>rule</hi> thereof? yea, if your judgment and conſcience be not both extinct, muſt you not conſent to the law and doctrine therein held forth, that it is good, what ever be your averſion therefrom?—(2.) Is not an <hi>immortal ſoul</hi> and a being for ever, ſuch a venture as is of more value, and ſhould be to you, than the whole world?—(3.) O how can you be thus <hi>indetermined about ſo great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt?</hi> you ſeem to be heſitant and unſure, if there be another world, a <hi>heaven</hi> or a <hi>hell:</hi> but oh, are you ſure theſe are not? and how then can you be ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſuch a fear, which of all fears is the greateſt? (4) What a <hi>horrid</hi> and uncomfortable thing is it to be an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> which gives men no hope beyond this <hi>preſent</hi> life? Yea, what a world would <hi>this</hi> be to dwell in, if there were no true <hi>godlineſs</hi> in it, ſince without this, no comfortable humane ſociety, no kindly and right ſubjection to the magiſtrate, can be expected from thoſe, who have no tie from <hi>above,</hi> and know not what it is to pay homage to a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign being.

               <p>I ſhall only add, is it not rare to find a profeſſed <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> at <hi>death,</hi> when once the approach of another world does <hi>awake</hi> the ſenſe of a <hi>Deity?</hi> But then it is eaſy to ſee men, who have ſported at godlineſs in their life, weep over that wretched mirth, when it comes to death, and call for ſuch Miniſters, whom once they hated: and oh, what a dreadful cure will <hi>hell</hi> be of atheiſm! for there they know the truth in earneſt, though it be their terror; it is alſo ſure the <hi>Devil</hi> is <hi>no atheiſt,</hi> who believes there is a <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>trembles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt yet a little further crave liberty, ere I paſs this argument, to ſpeak a word even to thoſe who know and have <hi>experienced</hi> the ſame, O how <hi>great</hi> ſhould this be in our eyes, and with what aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may we conſider it, which by ſo full, ſo ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a demonſtration doth witneſs, not to the eye or ear, but to the <hi>ſoul,</hi> the certainty of divine <hi>truth,</hi> and the power and reality of <hi>godlineſs!</hi> Should we not think, if there were but <hi>one</hi> in an age, or that every particular Chriſtian were but once at ſome ſolemn time of his life, <hi>thus confirmed,</hi> that he could ſay, then did he <hi>taſte</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> the word, and found it ſurely ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified on his <hi>ſoul,</hi> as ſure as he knoweth that he lives, at what a rate would he <hi>value</hi> and <hi>preſerve</hi> ſo ſingular a <hi>ſeal</hi> and confirmation of the truth, yea, keep up the remembrance of ſuch a ſpecial <hi>time</hi> whilſt he lived? But oh, muſt it be ſaid, that this grave wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this clear demonſtration of the Scripture and of the certainty of the words of truth, which we have by experience, doth loſe its weight, and the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value thereof is to be leſs regarded, that it is the Chriſtian's daily bread? O what a reach hath this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; what great things are there held forth? I
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005185_0140_1016DAA1AE5D79F0"/>
think a ſerious View of the ſame, if it were brought near to us, might put us to queſtion, whether we believe the ſame, or not? are we in a dream, or awake and ſee them with our eyes, which this doth ſo convincingly demonſtrate? whilſt we can ſo <hi>eaſily</hi> paſs them, with ſo <hi>little weight</hi> thereof on our ſpirit. Now to hold that forth, let us but bring near this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and gravely conſider the ſame with reſpect to ſome of thoſe great truths, which, by this unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable demonſtration of experience, are witneſſed: I muſt ſay, ſuch truths that we may wonder how men can ſo eaſily admit their being true, and in ſo ordinary a way look thereon without wondering and aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Doth not this argument of <hi>experience,</hi> by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clear demonſtration, witneſs that great truth of a <hi>Godhead,</hi> whereon the whole ſuperſtructure of truth and godlineſs doth ſtand? yea, in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner do's enforce on men the perſwaſion of this by a more near and convincing diſcovery, then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>works</hi> of God, or theſe glorious appearances of his power and wiſdom in the heavens, and earth do! It is true, theſe bring him near to our eye and ear; but O this brings the bleſſed and inviſible God nearer, into the heart and ſoul, that we may both taſte and ſee, that ſurely He is, and is <hi>that</hi> which in the <hi>Scripture</hi> he is declared to be. It is not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of nature, in its higheſt ſlight, can anſwer ſuch an aſſault of the <hi>Devil,</hi> which may exerciſe the moſt eſtabliſhed Chriſtian about the being of God; but there is a demonſtration within, which goes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the judgment, and paſſeth natural underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; whence we feel, we taſte, we enjoy, yea, his voice is heard in the ſoul, which we ſurely know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, and this is the reach and import of this argument. There is indeed cauſe to wonder at the atheiſm of the world, ſince men can look no where,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:005185_0141_1016DA5B3A2BF3D8"/>
without ſome witneſs of a <hi>Deity,</hi> to ſtare them in the face; but oh, there is a more <hi>refined</hi> atheiſm, that lies in the boſom of a <hi>profeſſed aſſent</hi> to divine truth, and is not eaſily diſcerned, though not the leſs dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that it goes under a cover, not only from the view of others, but even from a man's ſelf—I would here offer ſome things, which do witneſs a <hi>ſpecial advantage</hi> the <hi>godly</hi> man is at thereby to believe, and to be more throughly perſwaded of the glorious <hi>being of God.</hi> (1.) That he finds the believing of this is a very <hi>great</hi> thing, and not ſo <hi>eaſy</hi> to reach, as the <hi>world</hi> do ſuppoſe. For it is no ſmall matter even to attain this: Oh, what ordinary thoughts have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny about it, who think it eaſy to paſs an aſſent to this marvelous truth, becauſe they never conſidered the greatneſs thereof; but it is ſure, the more ſerious and grave a Chriſtian is, it will give him the more work, and we may find theſe uſually are more plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exerciſed about this, than others.—(2.) It is a great advantage, when this is ſo far men's <hi>ſerious ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> as to be upon an inquiry after a <hi>further eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in ſo great a truth; O what another ſight of the <hi>inviſible God?</hi> What a ſatisfying perſwaſion of his bleſſed being might we have, if our ſoul were indeed herein <hi>exerciſed;</hi> and knew but how <hi>little</hi> we know and have reached in this, that there is a <hi>nearer approach</hi> to God, which ſhould ſhew us, the faith of a Deity is ſomething <hi>beyond</hi> thoſe former thoughts we have had thereof! We loſe many ſingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations about this, becauſe we do not in earneſt look after them.—(3.) They are at a ſpecial advantage to whom believing of this truth (O bleſſed truth, that God is) is their exceeding joy, and amidſt their heavineſs can ſay, the thought and meditation of him is ſweet; that when through a variety of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they are ready to faint, this reſtoreth their ſoul, yea, will cauſe it leap within for joy; and is their <hi>Enough</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:005185_0142_1016DAA478F6D708"/>
when other encouragements are furtheſt off, that <hi>God lives!</hi> O what a thing is it in ſuch a world, and in ſome deep perplexing plunge, to know that <hi>the Lord is God,</hi> whom he hath now for a <hi>rock</hi> and a <hi>ſhield,</hi> and in the cloſe of time for <hi>his exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward!</hi> Can we have ſerious thoughts of this, and ſo eaſily turn our ſelves to other things without aſtoniſhment! yea, is it not ſtrange, there ſhould be oft ſo near and immediate a bordering betwixt our thoughts of the glorious God and the meaneſt trifle. (4.) It is no ſmall advantage, where men can open the Bible and retire into it, under the ſenſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a <hi>Godhead,</hi> and that near <hi>correſpondence</hi> he hath this way with his people; on whoſe ſoul theſe words have aw and authority, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> yea, have that repoſe upon <hi>his teſtimony</hi> and <hi>promiſe,</hi> which the ſolid perſwaſion of his being and faithfulneſs ſhould cauſe.—(5.) They have come a great length here, that in their ordinary walk are under ſome weight and impreſſion of this that <hi>God is near;</hi> who <hi>knows their ſitting down and riſing up;</hi> from whoſe ſight they cannot ſhift one thought; yea, that on him they have ſuch an abſolute dependance, that without him they can not draw their breath. O where this is believed, muſt it not cauſe both fear and wondering?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is not this an argument, which by a ſure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable demonſtration do's witneſs the truth and reality of <hi>grace</hi> that there is ſuch a thing, and is no empty ſound, which doth <hi>raiſe</hi> man above the <hi>natural</hi> ſtate of men, as far as reaſon puts him above the ſtate of the beaſt! It is truly ſtrange, this ſhould be believed, and yet is not more marvellous in our eyes, how we can be at ſuch reſt, whilſt one of theſe two lies under debate, the reality of <hi>grace,</hi> or our being really intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein. O is there not cauſe of aſtoniſhment, that ſuch a product of heaven ſhould be found in the earth,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005185_0143_1016DA5CCC0FA198"/>
whoſe deſcent and original is ſo clearly demonſtrated by its breathing upwards after God, its native tendency and motion towards him, whence it came? Surely <hi>grace</hi> is a great ſubject to think on; and that it is not ſo in our eyes, it muſt be either becauſe we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, or do not conſider what a change it makes on the ſoul, which is no tranſient diſpoſition, but <hi>the ſeed of God that remains.</hi> Is not this ſuch a thing as makes ſpring in the winter, cauſeth men to grow under their greateſt weights, lifts the ſoul up from the clay, yea does by bringing it low in its own eyes, raiſe it nearer God? This makes a man to have another appearance, on which the world is forc'd to look with ſome aſtoniſhment. One Chriſtian doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire this in another; and the more it ſhews it ſelf, it cauſeth a more near approach betwixt their ſouls. It will cauſe fear in them who hate it, and hath a power even over its perſecuters. Now it is the truth and reality of this excellent thing, that this argument <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o's witneſs; yea ſuch a witneſs that can admit no debate, where experience makes it ſure: I confeſs a ſerious view and perſwaſion of this might make the <hi>Chriſtian's</hi> life a continued wonder: that there is ſuch a thing, which by a marvellous ſurpriſal did prevent him when he was not aware, hath entred him into a new world, and tranſlated him from a ſtate of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto a marvellous light, cauſeth the ſoul to breath in another air, brings him ſo near that ſtate of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſubdues the will without violence, and ſubjects it with its own conſent; yea, by ſo ſtrait a tie is link's with an eternal glory and bleſſedneſs! Surely this is one of the moſt ſtately pieces of the work of God, that exceeds the whole ſtructure of the univerſe. O with what aſtoniſhment ſhould we look on this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous thing, if we could conſider the whole frame and ſtructure of the grace of God in a Chriſtian, and there make as it were a diſſection in its ſeveral parts
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005185_0144_1016DAA608A151F0"/>
and proportions, its decay and languiſhing, its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent changes and ſizes, its vigorous actings and abatements; how it breathes, is nouriſhed, is kept green and preſerved by a continued intercourſe with the fountain of its being! and lo, whilſt we conſider this great wonder, both in the whole and in its parts, we may ſee how in theſe it do's moſt exactly anſwer that model we have thereof in the <hi>ſcripture</hi> of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is a great argument, and ſhould be ſo in our eyes, which do's not only witneſs the reality of grace in its acting and exerciſe (which in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſection is ſpecially pointed at) but do's unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably demonſtrate a <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> and being, which the Chriſtian knows and is perſwaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as he is ſure he breathes and hath a natural life! O what a marvellous demonſtration is this, wherein ſenſe and feeling doth in as certain a way concur, as in any diſcovery we have by our outward ſenſes, that there is a <hi>new life</hi> and <hi>another being,</hi> (beſides that we have by nature) which anſwers to a <hi>new birth;</hi> yea, another breathing and acting, that is alſo ſuted thereto! but oh, can it be ſaid, we believe and know it is aſſuredly true, who have ſuch common and paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts thereof, and do not conſider what it is whereof we are ſure!—(1.) That this is ſo <hi>great</hi> a thing; it may indeed cauſe wonder, to think we are <hi>men,</hi> and that we have a <hi>rational</hi> being: but O a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> life is another cauſe for wondering, which comes not by our birth, hath no natural cauſes, yet a life that hath its proper <hi>operation,</hi> and <hi>vital acts</hi> put forth, as truly as theſe natural actions of breathing and moving are put forth, by a living man; a life that hath in as ſenſible a way quickning and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences, as the earth or bodies of men know the influences of the heavens; which hath a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight peculiar to its nature, that hath
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:005185_0145_1016DA5E59FB5248"/>
no affinity with things we enjoy by the ſenſes, but is a pleaſure do's far exceed the ſame! And is this a ſmall matter to be perſwaded of? (2.) What a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is it, which doth witneſs even to our ſence and feeling a <hi>power</hi> on the ſoul by the <hi>word,</hi> above the moſt perſwaſive words of man, and above all moral influences; by which men are not only reached, but <hi>transform'd into the ſame image;</hi> whence the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an knows, and knows aſſuredly, thoſe great truths, the <hi>ſealing, witneſſing, teaching, comforting of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. are no matter of words, or ſome ſtrange deviſed names, but are undoubted <hi>realities</hi> acted and verified on the ſoul.—(3.) If this demonſtration of a ſpiritual life be ſure, have we not thus alſo an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and <hi>being with God</hi> put beyond debate? for, if we be certain of the one, O is not this undeniable, that this noble being of the new creature, this life that is here begun, muſt have a more full growth, &amp; be at the furtheſt ſtature of the man in Chriſt; when we now ſee it with our eyes in its infancy, and upon a growing advance towards the ſame? For the one is ſurely as demonſtrative of the other, as a young child which we ſee in a growing tendency towards a man, doth ſhew there is a man in his furtheſt growth. (4.) If we aſſuredly know this <hi>Spiritual life,</hi> muſt we not alſo admit the undoubted truth of <hi>ſpiritual beings,</hi> and of an <hi>inviſible world,</hi> with which this life hath its <hi>correſpondence;</hi> yea, thus as by a ſtream be led up to the true fountain, to know an <hi>inviſible God!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. How great an <hi>argument</hi> is this, which gives us ſuch a demonſtration, that <hi>heaven</hi> is not altogether <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred</hi> until we be there, but that ſuch a thing is ſure now, as the real <hi>preſence</hi> of the glorious <hi>God,</hi> and a near familiar approach of him to the ſoul, which is <hi>here</hi> as really felt and enjoyed, as we can be ſure of any thing?

a <hi>change</hi> on their ſoul, and <hi>compoſure</hi> of mind, that even by-ſtanders might ſee <hi>where they have been!</hi> Now this is the Chriſtian's witneſs, which all who are ſerious in the way of the Lord, can in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure bear, that in a way no leſs ſure &amp; demonſtrative than any thing here beneath can be known, they have had ſuch a diſcovery: and now theſe ſtrange <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-truths,</hi> the meaning whereof once they could not know (ſuch as, to have their ſoul <hi>melting</hi> within at <hi>the voice of their beloved,</hi> to have his <hi>name</hi> as <hi>ointment poured forth,</hi> and be <hi>brought near</hi> to <hi>ſee his face with joy</hi>) they know well that they are as truly veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied on the heart, as they are written before their eyes in the word.—I ſhall but add, it is a very great thing theſe know, who know aſſuredly the real <hi>preſence of God</hi> here; for thus they are made ſure that He is, as one may know the ſun, when he feels its warming heat, and when he ſees it with its own light: thus they are confirmed of the truth of the Scripture, whilſt they ſee and feel one of the moſt marvellous things therein verified.</p>

It may truly be a queſtion, whilſt we are moſt in the practice of this duty, if we <hi>believe</hi> the truth and reality thereof: but it is beyond queſtion, what Chriſtians have moſt <hi>ſenſibly</hi> found here, that they can ſay, if they be ſure they have a ſoul, they have been as ſure, in this bleſſed way, they have had <hi>their ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored</hi> and return'd again; and under ſome <hi>deliquium,</hi> that by <hi>wreſtling</hi> they have at laſt <hi>prevail'd;</hi> yea, have got an <hi>anſwer</hi> from heaven, as if they had got it by an audible <hi>voice.</hi> Now is not this a great and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous demonſtration!</p>
               <p>But oh what <hi>common</hi> thoughts have we thereof! and may not theſe things ſeem <hi>ſtrange,</hi> if ſeriouſly conſidered!—(1.)

It is ſtrange, we can find it ſo <hi>eaſy</hi> a matter to <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>appear before</hi> God; that we are not afraid, to be <hi>haſty in uttering a matter before him,</hi> whilſt we conſider <hi>God is in heaven,</hi> and <hi>we are but on the earth!</hi> It is ſure, if we intend the bringing of our <hi>ſoul</hi> with us in ſuch a duty, it ſhould be more our ſtudy to <hi>watch unto prayer,</hi> throughout our walk.—(3.) It may ſeem ſtrange, how eaſily we can <hi>ſtep out from the world</hi> and the noiſe thereof, in <hi>before the Lord,</hi> without the leaſt <hi>pauſe</hi> or time interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which the impreſſion of ſo great a buſineſs ſhould require; yea, ſo <hi>immediately,</hi> in our return, again ſtep <hi>into the world,</hi> as if we had wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got where we have been.—(4.)

<pb n="114" facs="unknown:005185_0149_1016DAB30BF7E378"/>
a Chriſtian, like the breathing of the child after the breaſt. Alas, it's ſad, that this ſeems rather a piece of <hi>invention</hi> many times, than a matter of earneſt with the Lord; not ſo much the breathing of the ſoul in deſire after him, as the expreſſing what ſhould be our deſires. O to what a claſs can ſuch a piece of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> be reduced, as appears in our formal approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to God?—(5.) Should we look on prayer as a <hi>duty,</hi> and not conſider it as a ſingular <hi>enjoyment</hi> alſo; without which this <hi>earth</hi> would have a near appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>hell,</hi> if we could not thus ſolace the ſoul in God, and get a vent under its greateſt preſſures?

               <p>Now to ſhut up this <hi>Argument,</hi> I ſhall but add the teſtimony of <hi>two</hi> great and eminent <hi>Witneſſes</hi> to the truth; who after they had been helped to <hi>ſerve their

had <hi>ſatisfied him with a long life.</hi> And now, ſays he, I have no more to wait for, but the fulfilling of that <hi>laſt</hi> word of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> to <hi>ſhew him his ſalvation,</hi> for which in confidence he longed. This, though not writ by theſe who have given an account of his life in our language; yet I had the ſame from thoſe moſt worthy of credit, who not only from ſome of the greateſt <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants had it, when they were in <hi>France,</hi> as a known and ſure paſſage, but told me they read the ſame there in a printed relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that language, about his life and death.</p>
               <p>The 2d. teſtimony I ſhall here offer is from a grave an eminent miniſter of Chriſt in our own Church within theſe few years, Mr. GEORGE GILLESPIE; who near his death did declare to thoſe who were by, what a large proof he had, and aſſured perſwaſion of the truth of the Scripture from <hi>experience;</hi> that he knew ſo well what adventuring on the word was, and what it was to live on divine aſſiſtance, and be thus in all his concernments carried through, that he could not deſire, were he to live in the world, a more deſirable and ſatisfying life, than that of a continued reliance and depending on the Lord: and truly amongſt many notable experiments that man of God had thereof, this was one very convincing, how in a ſtrange land, whither he was called on the ſervice of the Church, and in a grave aſſembly of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the greateſt divines in that age, when one day he was ſurpriſed with an unexpected rencounter of a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Man Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> who came on deſign, with ſome others of that party upon the <hi>Eraſtian</hi> intereſt, to debate for it, by the ſtrongeſt arguments which they had then praemeditated for its defence; whilſt none ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in that great aſſembly to give a return, though there were many ſingularly learned and able, he did on an immediate reliance on God adventure (leſt the adverſary ſhould take advantage thereat) and gave
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005185_0153_1016DABB27916500"/>
a ſhort account of thoſe arguments adduced, wherein the ſtrength of his diſcourſe did moſt lie, with ſo clear and ſatisfying an anſwer as aſtoniſhed all; yea, did ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the adverſary, with a marvellous conviction. Now this was the more convincing, that having a little paper-book in his hand, in which he was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to write down ſomething, he was by ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preſſed to let them ſee his notes, ſuppoſing the heads of his following diſcourſe were in it, but found only in ſome Pages theſe words ſeveral times writ down,—<hi>Light, O Lord, and aſſiſtance,</hi>—his ſoul being then carried upward for the ſame. Thus did that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man give in his witneſs to the truth, when he was dying, from the ſure experience he had thereof, through his life; and with much aſſurance of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God, died. Which, I muſt ſay, is a remark, that in many inſtances might be obvious; how <hi>great peace</hi> and an <hi>abundant entrance,</hi> thoſe have found in the cloſe of the day, who have been helped to moſt faithfulneſs in the publick intereſts of Chriſt and his Church, and to the moſt ſevere adherence to their light, about the duties of the time; which I knew in another worthy Miniſter of Chriſt, not many years ſince, who by ſome of his laſt words did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs an unexpreſſible joy he found in this, that the Lord had kept him in a time of many trials, from giving his Ark a wrong touch; which he then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to ſtanders-by, when he was on the very thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold betwixt this and another World.

               <head>The SECOND ARGUMENT.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Our SECOND Argument, to demonſtrate the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Scripture, is this, that not only Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an experience, but the obſervation of the Church and people of God, doth in all ages bear witneſs thereto, how the Lord's way in theſe providences both of mercy and judgment, about the Church, amidſt the various changes of her condition, yea, in the moſt ſtrange things which fall out in the world, doth convincingly anſwer the word, and verify the ſame.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is indeed undeniable that the Scripture of God, as it is written to the perſonal caſe of his people, and doth in their experience take place; ſo is there a part of it in a peculiar way directed to the <hi>Church,</hi> the fulfilling whereof in the providences and events of the time ſhould be the ſubject of our <hi>obſervation,</hi> and would ſingularly help to confirm our faith of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>For proſecuting this argument I would touch it a little in theſe three branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How theſe <hi>general promiſes</hi> which belong to the <hi>Church</hi> univerſal, and concern her in all ages, have an accompliſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How theſe <hi>threatnings</hi> alſo of the word, which do not only concern the Church, but have a reſpect to her <hi>adverſaries,</hi> are certainly fulfilled, and take place in men's obſervation, who do obſerve the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How the Scripture of God doth clearly ſhine upon the <hi>darkeſt footſteps of Providence,</hi> even theſe which would ſeem moſt ſtrange and hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſo that it may be demonſtrate nothing falleth out in the world, or befalleth the ſaints, but what is moſt conſonant to the Scripture.</p>
               <div n="1" type="branch">
                  <pb n="120" facs="unknown:005185_0155_1016DABF83AA85B8"/>
                  <p>FIRST BRANCH. As to the firſt branch of this argument, I ſhall but inſtance five <hi>general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> which we find held forth in the word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Church;</hi> and endeavour to ſhew how very clear and obvious the accompliſhment of them is, if men do not willingly ſhut their own eyes.</p>
                  <p>FIRST Promiſe, wherein we find the Scripture expreſs, is the <hi>preſervation of the Church:</hi> that he <hi>will be with her to the end of the World,</hi> and though he make an end of other nations, yet, will he <hi>not make an utter end of her,</hi> but while the ordinances of the ſun, and the moon do laſt, and as the days of heaven, ſo <hi>ſhall her days be prolonged; againſt her the gates of hell ſhall not prevail. Jer.</hi> 30. 11. <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 18. Now that God hath truly verified this his pomiſe, and is as good as his word, is a truth, though marvellous, yet, ſo very clear, and manifeſt, that I am ſure no atheiſt can deny, it may be ſo eaſily demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that the <hi>Church</hi> doth <hi>continue,</hi> and is kept alive to this day, it doth certainly prove the truth of his promiſe. For it can be ſaid of her, and none can ſay it is a lye, ſhe hath outlived all her oppoſers, the greateſt of whom have found their grave in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, over whoſe tomb that laſt confeſſion of a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, <hi>Julian,</hi> may be written, <hi>viciſtitandem, G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> Hath not this deadly and irreconcileable ſeed been perpetuated from fathers to children! but who hath proſpered in that enterpriſe! the archers have oft ſhot, and wounded her ſore, but her bow doth abide in ſtrength, as at this day, this is her <hi>motto, Perſecuted, but not forſaken? caſt down, but not diſcouraged.</hi> She who hath brought many children, yet ceaſeth not to bear, whoſe age hath not marred her beauty, her eyes are not dim, nor her ſtrength failed; a ſight which may cauſe us no leſs to <hi>ſtand</hi> and <hi>conſider this great
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:005185_0156_1016DB0EC0CAFCD8"/>
wonder,</hi> then <hi>Moſes</hi> did, at that which was but the ſhadow and emblem thereof, <hi>a buſh burning, and not conſumed.</hi> For, behold, a Church kept alive, yet, ſtill in the flames! and when to appearance conſumed, it doth ariſe more glorious out of her own aſhes! This is indeed the only <hi>Phoenix,</hi> and we know no other, of whom that can be ſaid. Hath ſhe not born out thoſe univerſal deluges, which did like an inundation go over her head, of idolatry and paganiſm in the firſt times, and Antichriſtianiſm with Arianiſm in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ages; yet not ſwallowed up! Which may be no leſs marvellous, than when ſhe was kept <hi>above the waters, in the ark:</hi> and though her enemies have oft ſung her funeral ſong, and rejoyced over the <hi>dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of her witneſſes,</hi> yet, they have <hi>riſen</hi> again; her <hi>dry bones have taken life, and come together;</hi> and behold ſhe is alive at this day.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only the Churches preſervation, but the <hi>continued ſeries</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> thereof unto this time, doth witneſs the fulfilling of this promiſe: that in the darkeſt times of her condition, ſhe hath not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether diſappeared, even, when ſhe was ſo long hid in the wilderneſs, but ſtill in every age had ſome <hi>witneſſes;</hi> and though the Church hath oft cried out for the want of <hi>Children,</hi> and been heard weeping, bemoaning her ſelf becauſe they <hi>were not,</hi> yet, we may ſay ſhe never wanted an off-ſpring to this day; ſhe did never die without an heir, and ſeed of her own, to <hi>raiſe up her name,</hi> even ſince the Covenant was firſt made with her in <hi>Adam's</hi> family. And though <hi>particular</hi> Churches have their ſet times, which like the ſun, have the uſual periods, their height and flouriſhing, and afterwards a gradual decay, making way to the departure of light; yet, this made never void the promiſe of God to the Church <hi>univerſal,</hi> whoſe lamp was never put out, nay, ſhall not while the days of heaven do laſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="122" facs="unknown:005185_0157_1016DAC34BCA4B98"/>
2. We muſt alſo ſay that the continuance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Church is <hi>peculiar to her alone;</hi> and can be ſaid of no other intereſt and party beneath the ſun. For it is clear, that there was no Kingdom or Empire ſo firmly rooted, no ſociety ſo well governed by Laws, backed with power, which hath had the beſt title and claim, but Time at laſt did prevail over it, and made the ſame a trophe of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; yea, the greateſt Monarchies, and flouriſhing Cities have at laſt yielded, ſo as of them it may be ſaid, <hi>Nunc ſeges eſt ubi Troia fuit.</hi> But time cannot to this day boaſt of a triumph over the Church of God: though no nation, no family in the earth could ever plead antiquity with her. This is that intereſt, which hath born out all thoſe great revolutions, that ſo oft changed the very face of the world; yea, hath outlived ſo many Kingdoms and ſucceſſions thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It doth convincingly demonſtrate the truth of this promiſe of the Church's preſervation, that the World, yea, greateſt Atheiſts may ſee, this hath not come to paſs <hi>at an adventure;</hi> nay, not in an <hi>ordinary way</hi> of providence, but by a divine power moſt diſcernable therein: while it is ſo clear, (1.) That no intereſt, or party had ever ſuch <hi>adverſaries,</hi> as the Church, againſt whom the powers of World, and the powers of darkneſs have always been on foot.—(2.) That outward <hi>advantages</hi> have uſually been on her <hi>adverſaries</hi> ſide, not only the great men of the earth, but theſe of greateſt parts, and ablities. (3.) That their <hi>will</hi> was never wanting to their power, and their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> no leſs than to <hi>raze her to the foundation.</hi>—(4.) That this enmity hath been <hi>rooted,</hi> and <hi>irreconcilable,</hi> which time to this day could never take up (5.) That <hi>no other</hi> intereſt did ever endure ſuch <hi>violent</hi> aſſaults, ſo many <hi>ſharp</hi> batteries: for it is obſervable, that moſt of the wars and commotions of every age have been ſome way ſtated on the <hi>Church's</hi> account; and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:005185_0158_1016DB12083EC378"/>
what ever private quarrels men have had among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet it hath not hindred the purſuit of their malice againſt <hi>the woman and her ſeed.</hi>—(6.) That ſuch who have <hi>come out of her bowels,</hi> even the <hi>men of her own houſe,</hi> have oft been her greateſt <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and lain in wait to take her at an advantage in the day of her halting.—(7.) That her real <hi>friends</hi> have oft <hi>fainted</hi> in a time of her ſtrait, and <hi>ſtood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That the <hi>depths of Satan,</hi> in her enemies, <hi>as an angel of light,</hi> have ſometimes given her a ſore aſſault; ſo that <hi>if it had been poſſible,</hi> and ordinary Means could have reacht their end, they ſhould have <hi>deceived the very elect.</hi>—(9.) I muſt add this further witneſs to the marvellous preſervation of the Church, which in an ordinary way could not come to paſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we find <hi>no other</hi> party was ever <hi>brought ſo low</hi> and near death, and be <hi>yet alive.</hi> The knife was once at the Church's throat in <hi>Iſaac;</hi> ſhe did ſeek to adopt a <hi>bond-woman's</hi> ſon, inſtead of a lawful heir, when <hi>Abraham</hi> agreed to <hi>Sarah's</hi> overture for the outma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the promiſe; how near exſpiring do we find her in <hi>Egypt,</hi> when a ſentence to deſtroy all her male iſſue was gone forth? Yea, what but a miracle could have preſerved her, when ſhe was betwixt <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>red ſea?</hi> How low was the Church in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> and after in the days of the <hi>captivity,</hi> even broken to pieces with ſmall appearance of life, when her face was all blured with weeping, and her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies made ſport over her ruins at the rivers of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> when the Children of <hi>Edom</hi> cryed out, <hi>let us raze her even to the foundation?</hi> Yea, could the Church be nearer the grave, than when <hi>her bones were ſcattered at the graves mouth;</hi> but above all in that dark night, when her <hi>head</hi> and <hi>ſhepherd</hi> was <hi>ſmitten,</hi> and her hope ſeemed to be buried in the grave

with a ſtone put upon it; when ſhe could get no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment among the <hi>Jews,</hi> was <hi>wounded in the houſe of her friends,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in wrath <hi>roſe up againſt her;</hi> that for ſome hundred years the great Empire, which had <hi>trod down all the nations about,</hi> put forth the utmoſt of power and malice for her undoing! O who could have thought the Church ſhould outlive this? Yea, after all we find her toſt and hurried by <hi>Antichriſt</hi> into the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary more cruel than any that had gone before, where the <hi>Dragon</hi> watcht to get her deſtroyed: but how in all theſe, and through that long dark night, ſhe hath continued, and marvellouſly <hi>flouriſhed, as the palm-tree,</hi> under greateſt weights; ſo that we cannot but ſee that which <hi>her enemies (being judges)</hi> will not deny, that this promiſe to the Church, of her preſervation, is <hi>this day fulfilled;</hi> yea, that it hath not in an ordinary way been brought about. <hi>Surely there is no inchantment againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>nor divination againſt</hi> Iſrael; <hi>all her enemies have been found liars; happy art thou above other People;</hi> for <hi>the eternal God is they refuge, and underneath are everlaſting arms!</hi> Elſe long ſince ſhe ſhould have been <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up;</hi> may we not ſtill ſay with aſtoniſhment, <hi>O what hath God wrought,</hi> in her behalf!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SECOND promiſe,</hi> which I ſhall here inſtance, that God had made to his Church in the Word, <hi>Of her Increaſe and Enlargement:</hi> that <hi>the Earth ſhould be covered with the knowledge of God, as the ſea of water;</hi> and <hi>her ſeed be as the ſtars of Heaven;</hi> that <hi>her bounds ſhould be from the ſea to the utmoſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> which was promiſed to Chriſt in the behalf of his Church, and that <hi>ſhe ſhould poſſeſs the gates of her enemies.—Pſal.</hi> 89. 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 3.</p>

As this promiſe is expreſs in the Scripture, we muſt ſay it is no leſs clear and evident in its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment; that ſurely the Lord hath kept his Word, whereto the event doth moſt exactly anſwer; and though yet it be not to the full made out, I am ſure there is ſo much at this day manifeſt, conſidering the former condition of the Church, as undeniably proveth the fulfilling of the forementioned promiſe, which even to the conviction of greateſt Atheiſts may be demonſtrated from theſe grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>vaſt extent</hi> which the Kingdom of Chriſt hath had in the World. For this cannot be denied, that the greateſt Empire or Monarchy could never ſo far extend their conqueſt, as the Church hath done, ſince the wall of partition was taken down; ſhort are the limits of the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with this, whoſe bounds have been <hi>the ends</hi> and <hi>uttermoſt parts of the Earth,</hi> where neither <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> did ever ſet up their Trophees. Hath not the Goſpel, as the <hi>ſun</hi> made its circuit from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to the <hi>Weſt?</hi> yea, croſſed the ſeas, to the dark <hi>northern</hi> nations, thus <hi>fulfilling its courſe,</hi> in order to its turn again, to the place of its firſt riſing; that it may, as we are ſure it ſhall once, viſit the <hi>Jews</hi> again, and the <hi>eaſtern</hi> places of the World, that now are buried in a night of darkneſs: which, I think, will be as ſure a preſage of <hi>the break of day,</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of the Lord,</hi> as the morning-Star is to the World of the Sun's accompliſhing its courſe, and that it is returning again to the Eaſt where it ſhould riſe. Hath not the Goſpel now been through <hi>Aſia,</hi> where it did <hi>not tarry for a night;</hi> for many flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches were there, and the going back of the tyde from thence was its flowing to another part of the World: which is indeed obſervable of the Church as it is of the ſea, that what it hath loſt in one part, it hath gained in another. Did the vaſt diſtance of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>

its great barren deſerts, or ſcorching heat, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel's making a viſit thither! No, it was once a fertil ſoyle, and brought forth many famous lights; yea, ſomething yet doth both there and in the Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> parts of the World remain, to ſhew the Goſpel was truly in theſe places. And hath <hi>Europe,</hi> though laſt, been leaſt on this account? Yea, what do mean the late diſcoveries of unknown parts of the Earth, but to make way for a more full performance of this promiſe, that the Goſpel might ſtretch its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over the line? which ſurely was the gold and treaſure Chriſt deſign'd from thence, that even <hi>America</hi> might have her day alſo, and the <hi>voice of the turtle be heard in thoſe lands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only the large extent of the Church as to its bounds, doth witneſs this, but alſo the <hi>great and numerous off-ſpring</hi> of Sons and Daughters, which in thoſe parts where the Goſpel hath been, were brought forth to Chriſt. For we may ſay, what <hi>John</hi> ſaw in viſion, hath been very manifeſt to after-ages, <hi>an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company, of all Tongues. Nations and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> of whom it could be ſaid, <hi>Theſe are born in Zion!</hi> O how great a harveſt of the Nations is even already gathered? What a fleece hath every particular Church caſt? What a marvellous increaſe hath been in ſome places, after ſpecial tydes of the Goſpel? May we not ſay, that truth is now beyond debate, <hi>that out of one, and him not only as good as dead,</hi> but truly dead, <hi>there hath come forth as the ſand of the ſea, and Stars of Heaven, in number!</hi> the Church hath inherited <hi>Joſeph's</hi> bleſſing, of the womb, and the breaſts, in a fruit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> off-ſpring. <hi>The dew of Chriſt's youth</hi> hath been <hi>as the womb of the morning.</hi> O what a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and goodly company will this once be, when ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together! Then will the performance of theſe precious promiſes be fully manifeſted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This truth may be demonſtrated not only from
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:005185_0162_1016DB17FAF648B8"/>
the real conqueſt of the Goſpel, and thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent trophies of her victory over many <hi>noted enemies,</hi> who have after been <hi>veſſels of honour,</hi> but alſo from the <hi>feigned ſubjection,</hi> that ſo many have been made to render. Is it not ſtrange, what a multitude do in theſe times profeſs the truth, and yet hate it; and were never drawn with the cords of love? How very many have courted the name of a Chriſtian, and wooed the ſhadow of religion, who never knew the truth thereof? which certainly is a convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Goſpel's conqueſt, that ſo many <hi>knees ſhould bow to the name of Jeſus,</hi> whoſe hearts were never bowed, or really ſubdued to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is an unanſwerable proof of this truth, that we ſee, the Church's increaſe and enlargement hath come to paſs moſt punctually <hi>after that manner,</hi> yea, with all the circumſtances, <hi>as was foretold</hi> and promiſed: ſo that the event doth in every thing anſwer the word. For (Firſt) it is there held out, that from <hi>a day of ſmall things,</hi> which men would be ready to <hi>deſpiſe,</hi> it ſhould <hi>grow up as a tender plant,</hi> and <hi>ſpread forth its bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> over the nations; that <hi>the children of the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> ſhould be <hi>more than of the married Wife,</hi> and the <hi>glory of the ſecond Temple,</hi> exceed that of the firſt: and O! hath it not accordingly come to paſs.—(2.) This great increaſe and enlargement of the church was to fall out in the days of the <hi>new Teſtament;</hi> when <hi>Chriſt ſhould be lifted up,</hi> that <hi>then he ſhould draw all men after him.</hi> For thoſe promiſes we have thereof in the old teſtament, do clearly point at the times of the Goſpel: and doth not the event here accordingly anſwer?-(3.) The Scripture holdeth out that <hi>the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling away of the Jews</hi> ſhould be the <hi>riches of the Gentiles,</hi> and that their rejection ſhould make way for the fulfilling of this promiſe, even the ingathering of of the nations: and do not men ſee the event, with this very circumſtance?</p>

4. We find the <hi>Iſles,</hi> and <hi>utmoſt parts of the earth,</hi> are <hi>given to Chriſt for his inheritance;</hi> and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told as a ſpecial part of the Church's increaſe. And do we not clearly ſee, there is no place of the world, where Chriſt's Kingdom is more viſible, where more children have been begot to him by the goſpel, we may ſay, than in theſe northern places, even in theſe iſles of <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which are almoſt the uttermoſt parts of the earth; there being but little from that, and nearer the pole, which is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, yea we may judge hath been that <hi>Thule,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Ancients did ſo much ſpeak.—(5.) Was it not alſo foretold that the Church ſhould <hi>poſſeſs the gates of her enemies,</hi> at whoſe great increaſe the world ſhould wonder; the princes thereof ſee, and be troubled, <hi>while God is known in her palaces, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge?</hi> And doth not the event witneſs this, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  <p n="5">5. As the fulfilling of this promiſe about the church's increaſe is undeniable, ſince men cannot contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their ſenſe therein, we muſt alſo ſay, <hi>this is a thing great</hi> and <hi>marvellous,</hi> which no leſs than ſome <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> power could bring about; if we conſider theſe things: (firſt) that <hi>quick diſpatch,</hi> which the churches growth, under the days of the new Teſtament, hath made.

How aſtoniſhing was it, for the Church's riſe and increaſe to be brought about <hi>upon the ruin</hi> and downfall of the <hi>idols</hi> of the nations who had their temples, and were <hi>worſhipped as God;</hi> that the world ſhould be made to renounce its Bible, and that religion which for ſo many ages was deeply rooted by <hi>tradition from their fathers;</hi> thoſe <hi>altars,</hi> which were had in ſuch reverence, demoliſhed, and their temples made a ruinous heap; yea, that very <hi>name of their God's</hi> ſhould be thus obliterated, was not this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very wonderful?

Doth it not ſpeak forth ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, the carrying on of the Church's growth and increaſe, not only over the violence of men, but over all thoſe <hi>dreadful errors</hi> and <hi>inventions,</hi> thoſe thick <hi>miſts</hi> which both in former and later times, have <hi>aſcended out of the pit,</hi> to choke her; that we may ſay, the Church hath not only been helped to <hi>tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     <hi>THIRD Promiſe,</hi> which the Lord hath given to his Church in the word, is <hi>the giving of the Spirit and pouring out of the ſame;</hi> which is there expreſly held forth, and promiſed, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 17. <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>It is true, the Chriſtians <hi>inward</hi> experience can beſt witneſs this; for theſe have an argument from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; they <hi>know, and are ſure they have received the Spirit</hi> by the word, whereby they underſtand thoſe things which are <hi>ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> But that which here is intended, it is to ſhew, that the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> is truly given forth to the Church <hi>according to the promiſe.</hi> That it doth accompany the truth and doctrine of Chriſt, and purity of the ordinances, is a thing, which from clear undeniable evidences may be demonſtrated, to the conviction of the greateſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt. For I muſt think, even by-ſtanders, ſuch who never knew any ſaving work of the Spirit, but live in theſe parts where the ordinances are diſpenſed with
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:005185_0166_1016DB1EA107B040"/>
purity and power, if they ſhut not their eyes, may oft clearly ſee <hi>ſomething going forth</hi> with the word, that is beyond words, a <hi>divine Spirit</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> which ſendeth forth its favour in the daily admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Goſpel; yea, by its <hi>effects,</hi> and ſome convincing diſcovery thereof, doth force this truth in upon men's conſciences, who are otherways ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thereto.</p>
                  <p>Now to hold forth the accompliſhment of ſo great a promiſe, that God is faithful and true therein, I would give in theſe clear and convincing witneſſes to the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe excellent <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>endowments</hi> given to the Church, are they not a viſible proof of this truth? For it is undeniable, where once the Goſpel cometh, that <hi>inſtruments</hi> are raiſed with <hi>another ſpirit; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> ſent forth, while there is a <hi>harveſt</hi> to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and ſhaped for their work; yea, thoſe who were of mean and ordinary parts, when called forth to the ſervice of the Church, will have another luſtre; that it may be oft ſeen with aſtoniſhment, how far not only they exceed themſelves, but thoſe who were of more eminent natural endowments. I would but ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſk men who never laid this truth to heart, Whence is that variety of Gifts, ſo ſutably diſpenſed to the various employments, and different pieces of ſervice, the Church doth call for? How are they thus ſuted to the ſeveral times; yea, to the very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and temper of ſuch a time? Whence is it, that every gift and qualification is ſo fitted and diſpoſed for its proper uſe; ſome moſt peculiarly ſhaped out to awake and threaten (thoſe <hi>Boanerges</hi>) while others are ſet forth with a ſpirit eminently fitted to comfort; ſome mighty in perſwaſion, yet not ſo fit to expound; others moſt dexterous to inſtruct, yet not ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to apply; ſome having the gifts of tongues, and others the tongue of the learned to ſpeak a word in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:005185_0167_1016DAD05922A970"/>
to the weary; to ſome the face of a lion is given, when a heroick ſpirit of courage and reſolution is called for, and to others the face of a calf, for patient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during in ſuffering time! Surely it were a choice me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, to think how with as great wonder we may ſay of this excellent body of the Church, as of the natural body of man, how curiouſly, yea, marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly is it framed; where every part doth anſwer an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and to the uſe of the whole, each hath its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar excellency, and ſomething proper to every one's gift may be then ſeen, as well as in the face of man, by which in ſome things they differ from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe more <hi>eminent extraordinary out pourings of the Spirit</hi> do alſo witneſs this truth; which at ſome ſpecial times, when the Churches neceſſity requireth it, have been moſt diſcernable. When the Lord ſendeth forth his ſervants about a more then ordinary piece of work, either to do, or ſuffer; when he is to plant the Church in ſome place, where the Goſpel will meet with much oppoſition; is it not then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, how ſome more than ordinary power and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible efficacy doth accompany the truth, before which there is no ſtanding? The diſputer is then, in his reaſoning, confounded by ſomething above reaſon; the untoward and rude are forced to ſtoop before the word, and to confeſs they have to do, with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and not with words; yea, thoſe whom the Lord maketh uſe of, who were feeble and weak as others, in that day are made as a brazen wall, and a fenced city.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is it not alſo undenyable, that now under the New Teſtament there are <hi>Miniſters of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>not of a dead letter,</hi> and empty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound? That with the word there goes along a miniſtration of power and life; whence a Majeſty and authority attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public ordinances is oft ſo diſcernable, that
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:005185_0168_1016DB219B4EEBC8"/>
even thoſe who know not what the Spirit is, are made to ſee ſomething therein which doth dazle them with aſtoniſhment. Whence is it that at ſome times ſuch a beauty and power ſhine forth with ordinances, like a glance of the glory of God, even going before men's eyes, which for the preſent hath made a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change upon ſome very groſs men, and put them in an other temper, yea, forced them with fear to acknowledge, that ſurely <hi>God it near</hi> in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of his people? And I would aſk, whence is it the word giveth law to men's conſciences? that it ſhould ſpeak with ſuch an authority, as maketh them all to ſhiver, that even the worſt of men are ſome times made to ſtand before the miniſtry of the word, like men ſtanding at the barr, upon life and death, before a judge whoſe authority they durſt not decline!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is very diſcernable, what a <hi>great difference</hi> and <hi>another appearance,</hi> there is both on Miniſters, and Chriſtians <hi>at one time,</hi> from what they are at <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in the diſcharge of duty, as if theſe were not the ſame perſons; which appeareth not only in the enlargement, and ſtraitning of their gift, but alſo in power and life. Is it not ſeen, with what li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty theſe do ſome times <hi>pray,</hi> and are as a Ship with a full gale before the wind? That it is then eaſy to <hi>preach;</hi> when at other times there is like a ſhut door, that even hearers may perceive a ſenſible languiſhing, and them hampered in their very expreſſions, yea, as men rowing againſt a contrary wind; the word wanting that favour and relliſh it hath had at other times; and this not through a natural indiſpoſition, or want of preparation, but that which all who ever ſerved God in the ſpirit muſt confeſs, hath moſt ſenſibly attended them when they have thought themſelves at the greateſt advantage, for going about duty: O who can deny this evidence of the ſpirit, a thing in
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:005185_0169_1016DAD557293300"/>
all ages ſo ſenſibly felt, yea, even obvious to the worſt of men!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is alſo clear, that where ever the Lord hath had a Church, at ſome ſpecial turns of her condition there have uſually been ſome more <hi>ſolemn times</hi> of the ſpirit, and <hi>high ſpring-tides</hi> of the goſpel. There was indeed a marvellous flowing forth of the ſpirit of God after Chriſt's aſcenſion, which like a mighty current did carry all before it; at which time more ſucceſs did follow one ſermon, than hath been by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of many others in an age; this made the world wonder, as if ſome univerſal enchantment had fallen on men; what that could be, which the more they ſought to bear down, the more it increaſed, that made the rich chooſe poverty, and thoſe who dwelt in palaces betake themſelves with chearfulneſs to the dens and caves of the earth. But beſides this, it is very manifeſt, that in a large meaſure the Spirit hath been let forth to the Church in after-ages; yea, there is no particular Church where the light hath ſhined, but hath had it's ſpecial times, ſome ſolemn day of the pouring out of the ſpirit, before the ſun went down: which may be obſerved either at the firſt breaking out of the Goſpel, or at ſome other remarkable time and change of her condition; whence a great Flight of ſouls to Chriſt hath followed; beſides the reaching of the conſcience and ſtirring the affection of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under a common work of the ſpirit, which uſually goeth along with ſolemn times.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The going back of the tide, and <hi>viſible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the Spirit from particular churches,</hi> where it hath ſometimes in a large meaſure been let forth, is a very convincing witneſs to the truth of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

O, doth not ſo manifeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the Spirit witneſs the out-pouring thereof, and that it is a certain and real thing.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Do not the <hi>ſtirrings</hi> and ſtrong <hi>convictions,</hi> which even the <hi>worſt of men</hi> have ſometimes under the word, witneſs a divine Spirit and power going along therewith; that which forceth an aſſent from their conſcience to the truth, which otherways they hate; yea, maketh them for the time wonder they ſhould not have been more ſerious in the ways of God! Yea, it doth often put a thorn in the bed of their ſecurity! for indeed the word and the light thereof doth torment thoſe who dwell in the earth. And truly <hi>this is a marvellous thing,</hi> which get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in upon men's ſecret deſigns and counſels, doth reveal to them the moſt cloſe thoughts of their heart, which they are ſure men's eye could not reach, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them down through themſelves; and yet, that the world knoweth not whence it is! Yea, are they not forced to confeſs, what a great difference they find betwixt the word from the mouth of <hi>ſome</hi> who are holy and ſerious, though held out in greateſt ſimplicity, than from <hi>others</hi> even of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gifts, and accompanied with more ſhew of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that ſurely the one hath another ſound and reliſh, ſpeaketh more feelingly home to their

                  <p n="8">8. One witneſs more I ſhall here give to the truth of this promiſe, even thoſe eminent <hi>examples of the great grace of God,</hi> which in every age have ſhined in the firmament of the Church; ſome in love, and zeal, ſome in patience, and humility, ſome in the ſtrong acts of faith, and ſelf-denial; which do certainly demonſtrate a <hi>more excellent ſpirit,</hi> than that which is in the world; whence they appear with another luſtre in their walk and carriage, and have a ſweet and fragrant favour of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> to the very diſcerning of by-ſtanders; which truly ſheweth that <hi>his wind doth blow on his garden,</hi> when the ſpices ſend forth ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a Scent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FOURTH. We find an expreſs Promiſe in the word of Deliverance to the Church in a low and oppreſſed condition;</hi> that ſurely the Lord will plead her cauſe, will deliver his People when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is true, this promiſe hath its bounds, limits, and proviſo's, which ſhould be taken along in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication thereof. We know, the Covenant of God with particular Churches is <hi>conditional</hi> only; he promiſeth, that <hi>he will be with them, while they are with him:</hi> yea, it is oft ſeen (and there is no jarr here with this promiſe) that a People profeſſing the Goſpel, confederate with God following duty, have even <hi>turned their back before the enemy,</hi> and in the holy providence of God have for a time been given up to their fierce rage and violence. But it is alſo ſure, that this promiſe hath an accompliſhment, and in the day of the Church's ſtrait the Lord hath oft appeared, by a ſtrong outſtretched hand
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:005185_0172_1016DB27A25D2268"/>
for her help; his own arm brought ſalvation to his People, when they ſought to him: for <hi>God is known in her palaces for a refuge;</hi> yea, ſurely the Church might oft ſing that ſong on ſuch clear grounds, as though with <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhe had been ſtanding at the red ſea, <hi>Thy right hand, O Lord, is full of power, thy right hand hath daſhed in pieces thy enemies.</hi> For what nation, or People is like this, to whom he hath ſhewed ſuch marvellous things?</p>
                  <p>Now to ſhew forth the faithfulneſs of God in this promiſe, I would offer ſome few things that are a moſt clear and undeniable witneſs thereto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are few ages, but we have ſome <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of the church's condition,</hi> which hold forth ſuch <hi>ſignal convincing providences of God,</hi> in behalf of his oppreſſed church and people, as may be a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſeal to this truth. It is true, ſome times have been more remarkable for ſuffering, times of Judgment and of a growing trial, wherein this truth hath <hi>not</hi> ſo clearly ſhined forth; yea, that long night which the church had under <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> might ſeem to call it in queſtion: but nevertheleſs, if men take a ſerious View of the Lord's way, and the ſeries of providence in ages paſt, comparing one time with another, what the ſtraits and moſt extream caſe of the church hath at laſt reſolved in, they will find cauſe to cry with aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>Great deliverances giveth he to his people,</hi> yea, <hi>the Lord hath done great things for them!</hi> I am ſure, were there a full record, with that true account which might be given, of thoſe more remarkable deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that <hi>particular churches</hi> have met with, ſince the firſt planting of the Goſpel among them, wherein God's very immediate hand for their help hath been diſcernable, it would <hi>nonplus</hi> the World, and greateſt Atheiſts, about the real fulfilling of this promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>confeſſions</hi> even of the Church's <hi>enemies</hi> hath oft witneſſed this truth, that in purſuing their
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:005185_0173_1016DADD5E9B7AD0"/>
malice, to trouble and undo <hi>her,</hi> they have but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done <hi>themſelves;</hi> how tormenting diſappointments have cauſed their very fleſh to pine away, and the cloſe and iſſue of their rage forced this conviction from them at laſt, that the Church is a <hi>burdenſome ſtone,</hi> to be lifted up; a party, with whom it is full of hazard to meddle. Have not ſuch been made to diſcern ſomething of a divine hand, ſo clearly againſt them, blaſting their counſels and moſt promiſing at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, as if their eyes with <hi>Balaam</hi> hath been open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the <hi>Angel</hi> in their way! Yea, in all ages it is known, how the conſcience even of the worſt hath oft bewrayed ſomething of a preſaging fear, they have had, of thoſe whom they purſued with greateſt malice, and a dreadful impreſſion they had of a praying people, and their prayers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This truth hath had the cleareſt witneſs <hi>in times of the Church's greateſt ſtrait</hi> and <hi>extremity;</hi> when difficulties have appeared inſuperable, and relief in an ordinary way of providence moſt hopeleſs; when viſible means have been withdrawn, <hi>all refuge fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and none to help;</hi> that in ſuch a day <hi>the Lord hath been ſeen upon the mount,</hi> and unexpectedly by very ſtrange means brought deliverance to a broken, and almoſt ruined Church, even as it were betwixt the bridge and the water: ſo that who would have a clear view of the accompliſhment of this promiſe, may but turn back on theſe more remarkable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream exigences of the Church's condition, and there have it; how oft a ſweet ſunſhine that followed the moſt dark and cloudy times, a raging ſtorm hath reſolved into a refreſhing calm; yea, that with a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther growth of the Church's trial, and doubling of her burden, her enlargement and deliverance hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out with thoſe great &amp; obvious remarks therein, that it was a convincing return of prayer and wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, with a further addition of ſome new and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:005185_0174_1016DB2ABADE5BB8"/>
mercy there with, yea, ſome eminent act of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon her adverſaries.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The greateſt <hi>advantages</hi> and <hi>victories,</hi> which men have got over the Churches and people of God, can alſo bear witneſs to this, that <hi>when the wicked have ſprung up like the graſs, and the workers of iniquity ſeemed to flouriſh,</hi> this very way hath the Lord taken to bring about a more <hi>full deliverance:</hi> Yea, on the other hand, hath it not been very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious how the Church's <hi>gain</hi> hath been brought forth out of greateſt <hi>loſs;</hi> that thoſe wounds which ſeemed moſt deadly, by the infinitely wiſe providence of God, have turned to her moſt effectual and thorough <hi>cure;</hi> and men's unreaſonable violence and rage againſt the Church hath oft had an evident tendency to bring about even that whereto it ſeemed moſt directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſome further mercy, and deliverance, than could have been expected; as the <hi>Amorites</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Iſrael</hi> but paſſage through their land, did prove the very mean to give them more than they ſought, the poſſeſſion of that land for an inheritance.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This witneſs the obſervation of the Church in all ages can bear to this promiſe, that deliverance hath oft ſprung up, and been brought to her hand, <hi>from a quarter, and by ſuch means, as none would have expected;</hi> by ſuch, as <hi>none but God could do;</hi> a ſudden report and rumour (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 27.) Means that have been not only ſmall and improbable, but that looked directly <hi>contrary,</hi> as in bringing the Church out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yea, ſometime by the <hi>wicked's being enſnared in the work of their own hands.</hi> Is it not obvious, how the Lord hath employ'd men's <hi>private</hi> intereſts, to put them on for befriending his <hi>Church?</hi> and hath cauſed <hi>the earth</hi> to <hi>help the woman,</hi> and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up one oppreſſor to puniſh another; yea, often hath prepared carpenters, whence it was leaſt thought, to cut the horns of thoſe who had ſcattered his people!</p>
                  <p n="6">

6. There is this convincing witneſs to the truth of ſuch a promiſe, <hi>that ſudden remarkable change,</hi> which may be oft diſcerned both on men's inward frame, and the outward face of the Church, when a time of mercy and enlargement is come; inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments raiſed of the Lord, with a diſcernable elevation of their ſpirits to act, and <hi>do exploits;</hi> the feeble then made <hi>ſtrong;</hi> and thoſe who ſometime would have fainted at an ordinary piece of ſervice, dare with ſuch a gale of divine aſſiſtance <hi>run</hi> (as it were) <hi>through a troop,</hi> and <hi>overleap a wall.</hi> For indeed this may in all ages be obvious, how eaſy it is to move, in the day when the Lord moveth for his people, and ſtrengthneth the girdle of their loins; that it was not their bow, or ſword, which got them the victory, but the very finger of God, ſomething above the counſels of men, or ordinary means; which hath ſometimes been made clear as the noon-day, ſo that even, at ſome diſtance, thoſe who are <hi>wiſe to diſcern the times,</hi> did ſee when there was a breaking out of a day of a Church's <hi>hope;</hi> how there was a previous motion and ſtir amongſt the <hi>dry bones;</hi> the Lord, as <hi>in the top of the mulberry trees,</hi> hath been then diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, &amp; ſome promiſing appearance from the preſent diſpoſition &amp; temper of the Godly in that time (tho' we muſt grant, mercy and ſovereign grace hath oft met the Church, when little of this hath appeared) which, like the breaking out of that <hi>cloud</hi> in the top of mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> to the Prophet, though at firſt but as an <hi>handbreadth,</hi> hath ſhewed that deliverance to the Church was not far off.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I would add this witneſs alſo; thoſe <hi>convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing providences, which in all ages have been ſhewed againſt the enemies</hi> of the Church, ſuch as men could not paſs without ſome remark: what an <hi>iſſue</hi> thoſe have had, who have ſometimes been a ſore <hi>rod</hi> on the People of God, yea, <hi>a terror in the land of the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:005185_0176_1016DB2C671ACDA0"/>
living!</hi> How they have become a moſt abject and contemptible party, like bees who have loſt their ſting; their countenance hath been changed, and they ceaſed to be any more a fear, when once <hi>their work was done,</hi> and the date of their commiſſion for the humbling and trying of the Church expired; yea a <hi>judicial Stroke</hi> from the Lord hath been often ſeen upon their very judgment, and reſolutions, which could not then ſerve them to trouble and afflict the Church; the day being turned, and the time of her deliverance come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>FIFTH.</hi> There is this <hi>Promiſe</hi> alſo which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church in general, as well as Chriſtians in their perſonal caſe, <hi>That all things work together for the good of thoſe who love God, Rom.</hi> 8. 28. the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment whereof, as it is written out in providence to the obſervation of men, I would here touch.</p>
                  <p>This is indeed a great and comprehenſive promiſe, which in the conſtant courſe and tenor of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about the Church, we may ſee, it doth take place; how thoſe turnings and changes of the World, the moſt ſtrange emergents of the time, the various mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and intereſts of men, do co-operate together, and have an undoubted tendency to bring forth the Church's good, as though they did intentionally act for the ſame. There will indeed, one day, be a more clear and marvellous diſcovery of this, when <hi>the Lord hath perfected his work, and the myſtery of God it finiſhed,</hi> the Church brought ſafe to the harbour: then ſhall it be fully manifeſt, to what end all thoſe ſtorms and croſs winds in the counſels and deſigns of men were; thoſe things, which in the time could not be underſtood, but ſeemed perplexed and ſtrange, did really work for the Church's good. For then men will ſee with their eyes a full performance of the word: yet we muſt ſay, even here, in every
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:005185_0177_1016DAE42ADED2B0"/>
age, amidſt the various changes of the Church's caſe, this hath ſo clear a Fulfilment, that there is no ſerious obſerver of providence, but may bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That not only the <hi>Church's good,</hi> but even her <hi>greateſt</hi> good, hath moſt clearly had its riſe, and been brought forth, out of the <hi>greateſt miſchiefs</hi> and <hi>hurts</hi> intended againſt her. If we ſearch the Scripture, and will turn over thoſe after-records of the Church's condition, we ſhall there find, that the moſt remarkable attempts and plots, ſuch as <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> laſt eſſay to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Iſraelites, Haman's</hi> great deſign to root out the ſeed of the Jews, that great Maſter-plot Satan once had on foot, to cruſh the Goſpel and the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church by crucifying her head, yea, in theſe laſt times <hi>Antichriſt's</hi> killing the witneſſes, have all, as if really intended by the inſtruments as well as the firſt mover, brought forth the Church's greateſt good; ſo as the after-mercy and relief hath carried ſome viſible proportion to her trial, and to the greatneſs of her adverſaries deſign.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may be alſo clear, if we but trace back thoſe <hi>memorable changes,</hi> which have been up and down the earth, how <hi>direct a tendency</hi> they have had to <hi>this end,</hi> Did not the bringing down that <hi>great image of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </hi> witneſs this? We find <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi> raiſed up as a rod to the Church, and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> for a deliverer; we may ſee the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Monarchies brought down, to make way for the ſetting up of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> his Kingdom. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus</hi> muſt ſtand up a little for a ſharp trial, and his downfal give the Church a new breathing, and hold forth to after-ages a remarkable monument of the judgement of God againſt his enemies. Peaceable <hi>Auguſtus</hi> muſt fall in with his time <hi>in whoſe days ſhall be abundance of peace.</hi> We find a <hi>Titus</hi> ſet up to execute the judgement of God on the Jews, to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:005185_0178_1016DB309FD05538"/>
make way for a further enlagement to the gentile Church; a <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Domitian</hi> to help forward the Churches ſuffering, and a <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to give her ſome reſt, after ſo long and ſore an aſſault; and at laſt, the <hi>Roman</hi> empire mouldred down, for <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's</hi> up ſetting, to accompliſh what did remain of the ſufferings of Chriſt, in his Church, by that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may oft ſee a very <hi>ſtrange concurrence</hi> of things! how inſtruments act to bring about the Lord's end, and advance his Church's intereſt, even while each one doth moſt vigorouſly drive their own proper end and deſign; which ſheweth, there is ſurely a <hi>living ſpirit in the wheels,</hi> that ordereth theſe motions, a ſupream and firſt mover that can thus determine them, whether they will, or not, to ſerve his end, and to promote the Church's good, when they moſt directly intend the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We have ſeen how in men's plotting the ruin of the Church, there is oft <hi>an unſeen hand determining their judgment and inclination,</hi> to fall upon that very <hi>way,</hi> than which we would think nothing could have been more direct for <hi>her good</hi> and their own <hi>ruin;</hi> how an <hi>Huſhai</hi> hath been ſent in, or ſome have been ſtirred up amongſt themſelves (upon their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt) to break the pernicious counſels and deſigns of others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We have alſo ſeen the <hi>perſonal quarrels</hi> of the Church's enemies among themſelves brought to ſuch an height, and to fall out ſo ſeaſonably, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers might clearly perceive that it hath been from <hi>the Lord;</hi> a judgement for their rage and violence againſt his poor oppreſſed People.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We have ſeen the Church's <hi>enemies</hi> raiſed to a ſtrange height, all advantages favouring them, until their <hi>mine hath been ripe for ſpringing;</hi> and lo, at that very juncture, ſomething <hi>unexpected</hi> hath fallen
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:005185_0179_1016DAE5B4F36B80"/>
out, which did turn their former ſucceſs to their further ruin, yea, diſappoint all. This, the World is ready to call ſome fatal and malevolent conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which cannot be reſiſted: and what is this, in effect, but the witneſs of men's conſcience to a divine hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7.

                  <p n="8">8. We have ſeen moſt <hi>deſpicable</hi> and <hi>ordinary</hi> things made <hi>ſubſervient</hi> for ſome <hi>great</hi> piece of the Lord's work; a very ſmall thing made the <hi>firſt riſe</hi> of ſtrange revolutions; that remarkable changes have been oft lying in the boſom of a common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: yea, truly we find both Scripture, and the obſervation of after-ages, Witneſs, that the Church's deliverance and relief did almoſt never come <hi>that way,</hi> by ſuch a method and means, as <hi>ſhe</hi> had moſt <hi>expected</hi> the ſame; and that <hi>God's time</hi> of working may be oft very contrary to <hi>our time</hi> of expecting.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add; Is it not oft ſeen (which, I am ſure, all ages can witneſs) how men's endeavours to <hi>darken the truth</hi> by errour, have been the effectual <hi>means</hi> for its further <hi>clearing?</hi> That the <hi>growing of a trial,</hi> a violent and ſore exacting upon the Church, hath <hi>kindly wrought</hi> towards her relief and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; her <hi>meat</hi> hath been oft brought even out of the <hi>eater,</hi> by means moſt deſtructive thereto; and a <hi>ſword</hi> muſt pierce the Church's heart, that the <hi>tho'ts of many</hi> may be diſcovered; a time of <hi>perſecution</hi> muſt help to cure the <hi>diviſions</hi> amongſt the godly,

                  <p>I touched a little ſome Scripture-threatnings, in the preceeding argument, as concerned Chriſtians in their private experience: what I here intend, is to point at this truth, as it is written in the providences and judgments of every time, to men's obſervation; how judgments from the Lord, which point, as with the finger, at the abounding ſins of that time, do reach <hi>a land,</hi> and <hi>particular Churches,</hi> according to the threatnings of the word. This is indeed manifeſt, that the greateſt promiſes made to a people, we find backed with ſadeſt threatnings: and accordingly we find, the greateſt monuments of wrath have uſually been ſet up, where ſometimes the largeſt offers of the Goſpel were; yea, that the anger of the Lord may draw ſo deep, againſt a people profeſſing his name as to make their land deſolate, and the high ways thereof mourn; for in this precinct of the Church doth both judgment and mercy moſt eminently ſhine forth, and the Lord's way there doth differ from that he hath with any other people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="unknown:005185_0181_1016DAE8DB4A1580"/>
Now to clear this grave truth a little, how thoſe threatnings of the word, againſt a nation and people, becauſe of ſin, are alſo verified in their judgments, I ſhall touch a few inſtances, that are moſt known and obvious, where we may lay the word and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Church together, and ſee how they anſwer one the other.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We find the <hi>Threatnings of the word do point at the time of a people's judgment.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 15, 18. That when they <hi>fill up the meaſure of their ſin,</hi> and <hi>their cup is full,</hi> the Lord will not then defer the execution; until the cup of the <hi>Amorites</hi> was full, he did let them alone: and we find anſwer deferred, to the cry of <hi>the ſouls under the altar,</hi> for avenging their blood on Antichriſt, becauſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed party hath yet more to do againſt the Church, and the Saints more to ſuffer under their hand.</p>
                  <p>Now to witneſs the accompliſhment of this; let us but conſider what in all times may be obſerved. Firſt, that there is an ordinary <hi>growth</hi> and <hi>height of ſin,</hi> which a land cometh to, <hi>before deſtruction;</hi> ſome national and univerſal ſpreading thereof, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious outbreakings, the utter rejecting of reproof, which ſhew that a people's caſe muſt then be on ſome turn; yea, that ſtrange and unuſual ſinning uſeth to go before ſome ſtrange ſtroke.—2. Before judgment come, is it not ſeen, how the ſin of a people hath become ſo <hi>daring,</hi> that it hath had a loud cry? yea, their caſe hath been ſuch as did juſtify the Lord's procedure againſt them, even in the conſcience of all Obſervers, that he did it not without much cauſe.—3. Is it not eaſy, for ſuch as are wiſe to know the times, to ſee <hi>night</hi> coming on a land, when ſin is at ſome dreadful height, by conſidering the <hi>word</hi> and the Lord's uſual <hi>way</hi> with a people in ſuch a caſe? Yea, have there not then been ſome ſpecial <hi>forewarnings,</hi> a
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:005185_0182_1016DB36874FE708"/>
more then ordinary <hi>impreſſion</hi> of judgment upon the ſpirits of the <hi>godly,</hi> and the hiding of many of them in the <hi>grave;</hi> which, as threatning preſages, have ſhewed the near approach of a ſtroke.—4. There doth not uſually want even ſome <hi>Noah,</hi> or <hi>Jonas,</hi> the Miniſters of God ſent forth to threaten, who as watchmen upon the wall are <hi>diſcerning hazard</hi> at a diſtance; yea, with an obſervable <hi>preſſure</hi> then upon their ſpirit, and a more than ordinary <hi>agreement</hi> amongſt themſelves, to <hi>cry out,</hi> and give the people <hi>warning,</hi> when the time of judgment hath been drawing near.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is clear, <hi>there are ſome ſpecial evils and ſins of a time, which we find the word moſt dreadfully doth threaten:</hi> yea, in a peculiar way it doth put a mark upon them, that though the Lord ſhould paſs by many infirmities in a Church and people profeſſing his name; yet, for ſuch and ſuch ſins (as we find in <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 3.) <hi>he will not turn away the puniſhment thereof;</hi> but hath ſolemnly declared, by his truth and faithfulneſs, that theſe ſhall not paſs without ſome viſible mark, even before the world, of his anger. Now in this the Scripture is clear, and lets us ſee, there are ſome ſins more particularly threatned, ſome land-deſtroying ſins, that have as it were the mark ſet on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> which do eſpecially provoke the holy indignation and jealouſie of God; ſuch as <hi>ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> corrupting the Worſhip of God; <hi>Perjury, and Covenant-breaking,</hi>—Shall they break my Covenant, and eſcape? ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 15. Alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from God, and his way; <hi>For this the land ſhall be deſolate,</hi> as in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 9. 12, 13. Yea, <hi>blood guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs,</hi> which the earth ſhall not cover, and for which the ſword ſhall not depart, even from the houſe and family of <hi>David.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
                  <p>Now to evidence the accompliſhment hereof, I ſhall point at ſome things moſt obvious to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:005185_0183_1016DAEAAC2E8FE8"/>
of every time, how terribly the Lord uſeth to plead, for ſuch things, and by ſome exemplary ſtroke and judgment point them out, as we find them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſet by themſelves in the word, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that in theſe ſins, thus marked, men may ſee how their <hi>judgments</hi> uſe not wholly to be <hi>deferred to another world,</hi> but though much is oft paſſed here, and laid over to that laſt and great judgment, yet, upon ſuch ſins the Lord hath put ſome mark of his diſpleaſure, even in <hi>this life.</hi>—2. That for theſe he uſeth to contend <hi>before the ſun,</hi> and in the view of <hi>men:</hi> his judgments are indeed oft ſecret, and do <hi>conſume as a moth;</hi> but upon ſuch ſins, we may fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſee, ſome publick and viſible ſtroke is made to follow, that the world cannot paſs without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.—3. That the Lord alſo uſeth to be a very <hi>ſwift witneſs</hi> againſt ſuch evils. For, as we find, the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Church hath a loud cry, and the blood of the ſaints <hi>a how long?</hi> it is alſo ſeen thoſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſins do much <hi>haſten</hi> judgment, ſo as ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>that generation paſſeth away</hi> without ſome wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereto. It is rarely found, that ſome great revolt of a people from God, and breaking Covenant with him, doth lie long unpuniſhed, nor doth the hoary head of the violent and bloody man go oft to the grave in peace.—4. That theſe ſins uſe to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſome <hi>very dreadful</hi> and <hi>eminent ſtroke,</hi> which hath made the land deſolate, their cities ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time waſt, and a ruinous heap; yea, houſes great and fair, to be without inhabitants; ſo as men have with aſtoniſhment enquired, <hi>Why is all this come to paſs!</hi> and it was eaſy to anſwer, even <hi>for ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch evils hath the Lord done this,</hi> according to his word.—5. That a divine hand uſeth to be moſt diſcernable in the puniſhment of ſuch ſins, becauſe of a very clear <hi>reſemblance</hi> betwixt them, and the ſtroke;
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:005185_0184_1016DB39B0248A08"/>
which hath forced their own conſcience, as well as Beholders to confeſs the Righteouſneſs of God therein.—6. That the Lord will put ſome <hi>mark</hi> of his anger on the <hi>choiceſt of his ſervants</hi> for any <hi>acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to ſuch ſins; theſe to whom he hath given their ſoul for a prey, have yet got a ſore outward ſtroke, upon ſuch an account, which hath followed them to the grave; <hi>For this the ſword ſhall not depart from</hi> David's <hi>houſe.</hi> Idolatry rent the Kingdom from the poſterity of <hi>Solomon. Jonas</hi> ſhall not eſcape for his rebellion. Yea, God was wroth with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and no intreaty ſhall hinder his dying in the wilderneſs. I may add, hath not the Lord's controverſy on this ground even reached <hi>their poſterity!</hi> Which may ſhew that theſe threatnings are ſad earneſt; and ſuch ſins are not more particularly pointed at in the word, than they have been in after-ages made exemplary in judgment.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A people's lukewarmneſs, their ſlighting of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> and <hi>not receiving the love of the truth,</hi> we find ſadly threatned in the word, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 15. 16. 2 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. 10, 11. And truly we muſt ſay, they have not fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to the ground in any age, without an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as frequent obſervation can witneſs. <hi>Firſt,</hi> how a people's entring upon a Religious way, their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing a form of reformation, and not thorough for God therein, but on carnal grounds, hath thus put them in a <hi>worſe condition than before.</hi> For truly men's hypocriſy in going about a good work, doth threaten more, than the performance thereof doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. <hi>Jehu</hi> got a temporal reward, but his poſterity muſt at length reckon for all the blood of <hi>Jezreel.</hi>—2. That no people uſe to be <hi>further</hi> from getting <hi>good</hi> of the goſpel, than ſuch who have been under moſt clear and greateſt <hi>convictions;</hi> ſo as it is found, there is oft more acceſs to gain amongſt the <hi>ſavages,</hi> than thoſe who have ſit their day while the tide did flow;
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:005185_0185_1016DAEF14945F20"/>
yea, miniſters have found moſt diſcouragement, to labour in thoſe parts where the word hath been long preached with power.—3. It is ſeen, how <hi>light not improved</hi> will turn a People more <hi>groſs,</hi> and is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally followed with ſome remarkable <hi>growth in ſin;</hi> that the more the word doth put a <hi>reſtraint</hi> on men's cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the more it <hi>rageth;</hi> ſo as it may be obſerved what a very black die, the powerful preaching of the Goſpel hath put upon a People, as a viſible mark of Judgment on ſuch who profit not thereby.—4. Is it not ſeen how men's formality in the matters of God hath been oft <hi>puniſhed</hi> even with the <hi>taking away of the form?</hi> Yea, that ſeldom <hi>error</hi> and deluſion doth want a harveſt amongſt a People who receive not the truth in love.—5. Hath not ſlighting of the Goſpel been at laſt followed with ſome <hi>viſible reſtraint</hi> and <hi>inhibition</hi> both upon the ordinances and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers thereof, a judicial <hi>withdrawing of the Spirit,</hi> as to the work of converſion and conviction; whereby the Lord doth plainly <hi>ceaſe to be a reprover</hi> to ſuch; yea, even ſaith, <hi>Bind up the Law, and ſeal the Teſtimony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The word doth alſo threaten <hi>carnal Security</hi> (a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe whereof the Church is oft in great hazard) yea, we find it holds forth a certain connexion betwixt ſpiritual judgments upon a People, and ſome outward ſtrokes to follow thereon; that thoſe who are under that firſt wo and plague upon their <hi>ſpirits,</hi> are then near to ſome judgment upon their <hi>perſons,</hi> and may expect a ſharp wakening; <hi>in hearing they ſhall not underſtand,</hi> &amp;c. but the cloſe is, <hi>until their cities be conſumed without inhabitants,</hi> and <hi>there be an utter deſolation:</hi> yea, we find, judgment doth begin as a <hi>moth,</hi> in that 5<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Hoſ.</hi> but in the 14<hi>th</hi> ver. it doth turn at laſt to be <hi>a lion.</hi> We may truly ſay, the fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this hath in all ages of the Church been obvious. 1. That as the firſt part of the Church's deliverance is uſually ſpiritual, ſo it is found the <hi>firſt ſtep of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
                     <pb n="151" facs="unknown:005185_0186_1016DB3CBB0A3E18"/>
and the execution thereof againſt a People, hath been upon their <hi>ſpirits;</hi> that ſerious diſcerners of the time might know, the <hi>night</hi> was faſt coming on, and ſome ſad outward ſtroke on a land, by the abounding of ſpiritual judgments.—2. It is clear the moſt dreadful ſtrokes that ever come on a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, do uſually find it <hi>in ſuch a caſe,</hi> judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially hardned, and under many warnings plagued with <hi>ſecurity.</hi> Thus did the flood find the <hi>old World,</hi> and before that deſolating ſtroke on <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> were not the Jews in ſuch a caſe? <hi>Salvian</hi> can tell how it was with the <hi>African</hi> Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that dreadful inundation of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals;</hi> yea, the Church's records in all ages do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that before any ſad ſtroke or perſecution came upon a People, a <hi>deep ſleep</hi> and lethargy hath been previous thereto; <hi>gray hairs</hi> might have been ſeen upon them: and the Word doth even ſhew, that this will be the <hi>laſt diſeaſe,</hi> whereof the Church ſhall be ſick before the great day of the Lord.—3. It is alſo ſeen how ſpiritual judgments, when they grow upon a people, make <hi>great diſpatch,</hi> and do quickly ripen for ſome further ſtroke; that when men have run down their conſcience, and are paſt reproof of the word, going on from evil to worſe, the caſe cometh then to be clear, and ready for the final diſcuſſion of the proceſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The word doth denounce wo againſt <hi>the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of the Church,</hi> and thoſe who are her perſecutors; that <hi>the Lord ſhall recompence tribulation to ſuch,</hi> and <hi>plead with her oppreſſors:</hi> the accompliſhment whereof hath been truly manifeſt, yea to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation even of the world. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 5. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 6.—Firſt, That eminent <hi>oppreſſors</hi> of the Church have ſeldom gone out of the world, without ſome <hi>mark</hi> of divine anger upon them. Surely if there were a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of ſuch inſtances, that in every age have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:005185_0187_1016DAF22F698708"/>
men would be forced to ſee, and ſay, that the moſt noted enemies and perſecutors of the ſaints have been alſo the moſt convincing and noted examples of judgment in the ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e.—2. That the Church's <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> uſeth to go before a day of <hi>vengeance</hi> on the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof. We find, <hi>Jehu</hi> got an outward reward for executing the judgment of God on his enemies: but as for thoſe men who have been the <hi>rod</hi> of the Church, it hath been ſeen, that they have not long wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome <hi>ſcourge</hi> as ſore upon themſelves, as they have been to his People, and that at laſt theſe have paid dear for their ſervice.—3. We may ſee how this alſo doth help to finiſh the controverſy of God, with men and their houſes; that for this he hath taken many away in the <hi>midſt of their days,</hi> and made them ceaſe to <hi>be,</hi> who would not ceaſe to <hi>trouble</hi> the Church, while they had a being; yea that he had taken them <hi>in his own hand,</hi> whom men could not reach, and made their down-caſting in the midſt of themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Doth not the Scripture threaten <hi>carnal confidence,</hi> in a People; <hi>the putting of their truſt in man,</hi> or in any outward inſtruments? <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5, 6, 17. To clear the accompliſhment whereof, let us but compare the word, and the Church's obſervation together; and we ſhall find,—1. That outward <hi>means</hi> have never more <hi>miſcarried,</hi> than when moſt <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing,</hi> and when there was greateſt expectation from the ſame; yea, that very eminent <hi>inſtruments</hi> when much <hi>leaned to,</hi> have been obſervably <hi>blaſted,</hi> and made to ſhrink under ſuch a burden.—2. That thoſe whom the Lord had made much uſe of, yea, honoured to be <hi>great inſtruments</hi> in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Church, have oft had ſome <hi>diſcernable blot,</hi> to reprove men's overlading of inſtruments with their eſteem; a <hi>Tertullian,</hi> an <hi>Origen</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, yea, even a <hi>Luther,</hi> in theſe latter ages muſt go with ſome halt to the grave.—3. That
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:005185_0188_1016DB3FDFF71330"/>
many who have been uſeful in the Church <hi>for a time,</hi> the Lord doth oft <hi>lay by;</hi> yea, maketh not uſe of them to the end; but, the laſt may be made firſt. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that <hi>exceſs</hi> in men's <hi>eſteem,</hi> putting a further weight on ſome means, than they could bear, hath oft helped to render many uſeleſs.—4. Is it not alſo ſeen, how <hi>one extremity</hi> is thus plagued with <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?</hi> None more ready to <hi>ſhrink</hi> in a day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than ſuch who at a diſtance ſeemed moſt <hi>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi> yea, none more ready to fall in to that exceſs of <hi>undervaluing</hi> inſtruments, than thoſe who have moſt <hi>exceeded</hi> upon the <hi>other</hi> hand.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Do we not find the word threaten, and in a ſpecial way point at <hi>corrupt miniſters, unfaithful watchmen,</hi> who give not warning to the Church; thoſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds that <hi>feed themſelves, but not the flock,</hi> the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a people that <hi>cauſe them to err,</hi> and by their practice, to <hi>ſtumble at the law? Mal.</hi> 2. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>The accompliſhment whereof hath in all ages been very diſcernable. <hi>Firſt,</hi> how ſuch have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually been moſt noted as the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>moſt violent enemies,</hi> which the Church hath at any time had; yea, that no courſe hath been ſo evil and groſs that hath wanted ſome of theſe to help it on, whoſe hatred and perſecution of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath been found to exceed the moſt openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and profligate in that time.—2. That as they are particularly threatned above others in the word, ſo they get alſo ſome <hi>remarkable caſt</hi> above others <hi>in their judgment,</hi> and having once <hi>loſt their ſavour,</hi> become <hi>vile</hi> and <hi>loathſome,</hi> even to the worſt of men; are contemptible in the eyes of ſuch whom they ſeek in a ſinful way to pleaſe; yea, have a worſe favour, than the prophaneſt wretches; that being verified in them, <hi>Corruptio optimi, peſſima.</hi>—3. That theſe do ſeldom make a <hi>good retreat from an evil way:</hi> ſo as it is an uſual obſervation, it is rare for Church-men
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:005185_0189_1016DAF500D00200"/>
to repent, or a fallen ſtar to ſhine again.—4. Are not ſuch oft <hi>ſmitten</hi> even in their <hi>gifts;</hi> which we may ſee wither, and dry up upon them, while not faithfully improved; yea, to the very conviction of their hearers, to have loſt that edge which once they had in their miniſtry?—5. I muſt add another remark (though I deſire to deal with fear, and much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in ſuch an application of the judgment of God) how the Lord doth oft put ſome note of his wrath on the <hi>children</hi> and <hi>offſpring</hi> of unfaithful Miniſters; that it hath been ſeen, none more wretched and groſs: whereto as their evil practice and example hath been a ſpecial help, ſo likewiſe are they thus puniſhed of the Lord, who did not ſeek to beget Children to him, by the Word, but through their way did rather cauſe many to err and fall.</p>

                  <p>HAving ſpoke ſomething how the Scripture both as to the promiſes, and threatnings thereof, is evidently fulfilled in the Lord's ordinary way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure with his Church, I would a little further follow this argument, <hi>How this alſo hath a manifold accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even in theſe moſt ſtrange and dark paſſages of providence, whereat men are ready to ſtumble</hi> and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the ſpotleſs righteouſneſs of God, and his faithfulneſs therein; but if we lay them to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and line of the word which is ſtretched over the whole work of providence, we will ſee how well theſe do agree, and anſwer one to the other, yea, that all the paths wherein God walketh towards his Church, and people, are ſurely mercy, and truth.</p>
                  <p>To clear this I ſhall point at ſome footſteps of the providence of God in the world, and about the Church which would ſeem moſt dark, yea a contradiction to his word, and promiſe, but are plain and manifeſt,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:005185_0190_1016DB41CBCE3B68"/>
if weighed in the ballance of the ſanctuary, where we may have a ſatisfying look, and reſolution of theſe things which other ways would be too hard for us to underſtand, and may ſee, how ſtraight theſe paths are which we thought crooked; yea, how eaſy and paſſable, the greateſt deeps of providence would be, both as to God's way with his Church, and in our own particular caſe, when once they are ſet over againſt the word. I ſhall touch this a little in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It may ſeem ſtrange how the Church's trouble and ſtrait is oft ſeen to increaſe, with the firſt ſtirrings of her deliverance;</hi> yea, when ſome remarkable mercy, and outgate is in the bringing forth, the firſt ſtep thereof would ſeem to put her further back, and in a worſe condition than before. This is indeed a piece of the Lord's way with his Church which in many inſtances may be witneſſed, but let us take the word along therewith, and we will find.—1. How the Church is oft at the brink of the grave even when her caſe is upon a turn, and how it is congruous to his way (whoſe paths are in the deep waters, who cloatheth himſelf with darkneſs, that men ſhould not find any thing after him, or lay down abſolute concluſions concerning his dealing) that the motions of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould be oft ſo perplexed, and various—2.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The ſore interruptions which a people's endeavors for Reformation, and to promote the Kingdom of Chriſt have met with,</hi> even when ſet about with a clear call, yea, ſolemn and ſerious engagements to God, would ſeem ſtrange, and a ſhaking piece of providence: and truly this is oft ſeen, as an uſual attendant on reformation, how unſuperable like difficulties, and unexpected lets do grow up in the way thereof: thus when <hi>Luther,</hi> and other inſtruments were raiſed up in <hi>Germany,</hi> to purſue the Church's Reformation, what cruel edicts were then ſet forth to give it a daſh? diviſion among themſelves, the riſing up of the <hi>Boors,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſts:</hi> what a pure, and thorough refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was on foot under <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and what a dreadful ſtorm did quickly break it up, for that time? and I would add, what the preſent caſe of the Churches in <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> may at this day witneſs, where once the Lord ſo eminently appeared in a begun Reformation, which now is at ſo great a ſtand, but let us go in to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with this and we will find.—1. There is a vive portraicture of providence in the affairs of the Church held forth in that viſion which <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had of the wheels at the river <hi>Chebar,</hi> whoſe myſterious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and turnings ſo croſs one to the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſcord therein, as to the end, to which they were directed, doth witneſs the rational, and wiſe

conduct of providence: the Lord's work about his Church is a moſt ſhadowed and elaborate piece, which men cannot ſee, before their eye, as they ſee behind upon a review, while ordinary cauſes do oft vary in their operation, yea, go out of the common road, but ſcripture will make this very plain.—2. Was not <hi>Nehemiah, Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Zerobabel</hi> at their work, and duty, and had an expreſs call for building of the temple, yet, how great, and frequent interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did they find, ſometimes environed with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>Who art thou great mountain before Zerobabel?</hi> Yea, they were put to hold the ſword and build, to watch and work at once, becauſe of their enemies.—3. What a very ſore backſet was the Church at, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. <hi>Revive thy work, O Lord, in the midſt of the years.</hi> This was both a great and long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, yea, do we not find her almoſt at a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi> with a Query which no viſible appearance could anſwer, <hi>by whom ſhall Jacob ariſe for he is ſmall?</hi> 4. We find a ſpecial reformation ſet on foot by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with a ſolemn Covenant, by the Princes, Prieſts, and body of the People, with a ſetting up of the pure Worſhip, and ordinances of God, but lo a ſharp ſtorm is ſoon after, by <hi>Sennacherib;</hi> yea <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſcarcely is in his grave, when his Son doth bring in corruption, and perſecution both at once; and when the chriſtian Church in the times of the Apoſtles begun to flouriſh, ſucceſs following the Goſpel, did not a ſad interruption, and ſcattering follow, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 5. This is promiſed that <hi>Zion's</hi> walls ſhall even in <hi>troubleſome times be built,</hi> and her being brought to a heap of rubbiſh was but making way for a further advance, that in the building of her again the Lord might appear in his glory; and is it not clear, that Chriſt coming in the Goſpel, and power thereof to purge his Church, and carry on a reformation, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 4. proveth a ſearching and trying time which
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:005185_0193_1016DAFD0D5BC4F0"/>
men cannot endure, for the power of the Word, and clear diſcovery of ſin, and other ſhaking diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which do uſually attend ſuch times and torment them who dwell on the earth, yea, and put the Devil, and corruption of men aloft, with all rage to oppoſe the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That a ſad overclouding, and darkneſs ſhould come on a land after moſt ſpecial manifeſtation of the power and glory of God therein,</hi> and that a time of the Goſpel with much light ſhould be ſo near a forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wrath, and judgment, would ſeem a ſtrange piece of providence, and cauſe a ſerious enquiry how ſuch eminent appearances of God for a people, ſuch great confirmations, obſervable ſucceſs for a time, with many ſignal encouragements, ſhould all ſeem to reſolve in a deſolating ſtroke, and ruin? This may be inſtanced in that Proteſtant war in <hi>France</hi> where inſtruments were remarkably raiſed, fitted of the Lord for the ſervice of that time, had much of his preſence, and countenance, yet to reſolve thus in a bloody maſſacre; likewiſe theſe confederate German Princes, <hi>Saxony, and Landgrave of Heſſe,</hi> Men eminent for piety, carried forth with much zeal for God, for defence of the truth, yea, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that war having many promiſing encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet, remarkably deſerted of the Lord with very ſad like conſequences following the ſame. Let us conſider alſo the late <hi>Bohemian</hi> war, ſtated upon neceſſary defence of Religion and liberty, and at firſt attended with ſome ſmiling providences, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into ſo great a deſolation, and ruin: yea, the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> O, what a dreadful maſſacre of the proteſtants there did quickly follow one of the moſt ſolemn times of the power of God and outpouring of the Spirit that we ever heard of ſince the days of the Apoſtles. I confeſs this may have a ſtrange aſpect, and is a part of the marvellous ways of the Lord, but
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:005185_0194_1016DB4AE538EE40"/>
when we take it in to the word, we will find there is no jar, or diſcord here, for, 1. It might ſeem as ſtrange, and aſtoniſhing what <hi>Baruch</hi> got from the Lord in anſwer to his complaint, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 45. that he would pluck up what he had planted, and caſt down that which he had built, for a work to be thus thrown down, where the Lord had once ſo eminently appeared and given his People many confirmations might then occaſion great thoughts of heart, yet the unſpotted righteouſneſs of God, and his truth was apparent therein; yea, after that diſcourſe, and all theſe large promiſes, which Chriſt gave his diſciples in that ſixteenth of <hi>John,</hi> we find all is ſhut up with that, the hour is coming, and now is that ye ſhall be ſcattered.—2. What ſtrange providences did tryſt the Church in the wilderneſs, ſometime brought back to the red ſea, tried with hunger, and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, conſumed with various ſtrokes, and many years wandering until moſt of that generation, who came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> filled their graves in the journey, and yet this was after moſt eminent confirmations, and as clear ſigns of God's preſence as ever People had.—3. We find a publick reformation moſt zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly proſecuted by <hi>Joſias,</hi> which looked like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed eſpouſals of that land with God, by a ſolemn Covenant, yet, quickly after night came on that land with a long captivity, and <hi>Joſias</hi> did fall by the ſword.—4. Was there not a bright ſun-blink, &amp; flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing plantation of the Goſpel in Judea a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the deſolation of that land by the Romans, yea, we will find it clear from the word that times of much light, and reformation do much ſooner ripen for a ſtroke than any other times.—5. It is very manifeſt that particular Churches have their day where the Goſpel hath its appointed work, and their ſtroke at laſt may reach the length of removing the candleſtick. I truly think that ſad inſtance of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia's
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:005185_0195_1016DB002CE61078"/>
caſe may have this obſervable in it, that it had longer day, &amp; enjoyment of the light even from the times of <hi>John Hus,</hi> and <hi>Jerom of Prague,</hi> which was near an 100 years before there was any day-break on other parts, ſo that we would conſider if their night did come ſoon on, that their day was alſo much longer, yea, the ſtroke might tryſt with the ebb of the tide, when their harveſt was much gathered in, under ſo long a continuance of the Goſpel, though I dare not think the Lord's work is utterly extinct there, but that <hi>Bohemia's</hi> dead and withered root hath life yet in it and ſhall once again bud forth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Is it not uſually ſeen when judgment cometh on a land, that the Godly get the firſt ſtroke?</hi> but let us alſo conſider this in the word, where it is clear.—1. That judgment muſt begin at the houſe of God, and the green tree; and that the Churches trouble, and perſecution is a forerunner of vengeance on her adverſaries, do we not find, there is a cup of the judgment of God? And O the laſt is of a ſtrong compoſition, for the wine is red and mixed, and the dreg very thick which is reſerved for the troublers of the Church, and for ſuch who are at caſe in a day of her grief, and truly they have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that drink firſt, <hi>Bleſt are they whom thou chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, &amp;c. that they may reſt in the day of their adverſity until the pit be digged for the wicked,</hi> yea, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10. we find keeping of the word of patience, which doth import ſuffering to the Church, goeth before ſome more univerſal ſtroke; and in that day proveth the ſafety, and protection of the People of God.—2. It is alſo clear that men may be raiſed up of the Lord, and followed with ſucceſs, when he hath them for a rod to his church, but that at laſt <hi>

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>That proſperity, and ſucceſs ſhould follow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the worſt of men in an evil courſe, and cauſe,</hi> ſuch a concurrence, and ſeries of providence, as ſeemeth to ſmile on them even to the bringing of their ſinful devices to paſs, while the People of God have been made to fall in a juſt quarrel before their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, would ſeem an aſtoniſhing providence, but let us lay it fore-againſt the Word, and there we will ſee.—1.

Did not ſucceſs for a time attend <hi>Abſalom?

though the brutiſh Man knoweth not, nor fools lay it to heart for what the wicked doth oft ſpring, and flouriſh.

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>The long continuance of a heavy afflicting rod on the Church, without the appearance of an eſcape, or any return to much wreſtling and prayer on that account,</hi> may ſeem a ſtrange ſtep in God's way with his People. But the word will anſwer us in ſuch a caſe where it is clear,—1. That there are no bounds in the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſet to the continuance of a trial. It doth not tell how long a ſharp ſtorm may ly on, either as to the Church, or any particular Chriſtian; for it is a piece of the Lord's ſecret counſel, but not of that which is revealed: it is enough, that we know from it, that men cannot make the Church's ſuffering longer, than God's time.—2. It was a long term that of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> tryal in <hi>Egypt;</hi> &amp; after under the captivity, three hundred &amp; ninety days muſt the Church ly on her left ſide. O how many a ſad day and wearyſome night was there in that word 70 <hi>weeks are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon thy people, and city Jeruſalem.</hi>—3.

For thus the Lord doth oft interpoſe his long-ſuffering for ſometime, betwixt his people, and avenging of them.—4. It is alſo clear that there are many prayers before the Throne, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn whereof is ſuſpended, and an Anſwer to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in their particular, until that Time when God ſhall <hi>build up Zion,</hi> and then the <hi>Prayer of the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> ſhall be remembred, even as to Chriſtians pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate enlargement, when the Church ſhall be raiſed

We know the Church's enemies muſt have time to ripen, and it is not a ſtorm of a few days, that will <hi>purge away the filth of the Daughter of Zion.</hi> Too ſoon letting out of a ſore may cauſe it to putrify the more, and gather new matter. And truly the word can reſolve us in this, that one minute ſooner than God's time would not be his people's mercy.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is oft ſeen <hi>when there is ſome remarkable work of God on foot in a land, and ſome great outpouring of the ſpirit, how Satan ſetteth up ſome uſual counterfeit thereof,</hi> and bringeth forth ſomething of <hi>his work</hi> in ſuch a time, with a very ſtrange <hi>reſemblance</hi> of the ſame. Thus, with the preaching of the freedom of grace, and a clear diſcovery of that truth, did <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm</hi> under a very ſpecious pretext ſpring up. Thus we find the <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Antinomian</hi> party, ſet up in <hi>Germany,</hi> to run down a Church-reformation, under the ſhew of a more pure and ſpiritual way: and of late did not <hi>Familiſm</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of a more ſpiritual diſpenſation, caſt off the very letter of the Scripture, turning it over in to Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, and in behalf of the liberty of propheſying cry down a ſtanding miniſtry? But though this may ſeem ſtrange, yet the Scripture is very clear, concerning it;—1. That even <hi>Satan himſelf is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into an Angel of light,</hi> and in no ſhape pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth more dangerous to the Church.—2. That the moſt dreadful errours and a falſe way will oft come near to the choiceſt exerciſes of the ſaints, and have ſuch a reſemblance to the ſame, <hi>that if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the very elect ſhould be deceived.</hi>—3. Was there not a <hi>Simon Magus</hi> with falſe miracles ſet up over againſt the Apoſtles? And when the time of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias drew near, did not then a <hi>Theudas;</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee,</hi> break forth to amuſe the people? We find alſo an altar from <hi>Damaſcus</hi> ſet up beſide that which way ſhewed to <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of the Lord in the

For,—1. We find the Apoſtles, yea, Chriſt himſelf hath given expreſs <hi>warning</hi> thereof, that this ſhould be one of the ſpecial and greateſt tryals of the Chriſtian Church; whereof the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament we find doth little mention, that trial not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Church then ſo much, as theſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the Meſſiah's Kingdom: wherein the event may be clearly ſeen, to anſwer theſe predictions, which are ſo frequent thereof in the New Teſtament.—2. Doth not the event alſo anſwer the word as to that <hi>particular way</hi> and <hi>method,</hi> how error ſhould be propagated, which is there clearly foretold, by ſubtil undermining, under the pretext of liberty, with plauſible inſinuations? ſo that we muſt ſay, not only as to the matter, but with all theſe diſcernable tokens, even upon the manner, the word is made out.—3. Do we not find, this ſhould be a judgment on men, who <hi>receive not the love of the truth;</hi> and that after flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing times of the Church, when he who <hi>rideth on the white horſe,</hi> is gone forth, the <hi>black horſe</hi> and <hi>his rider</hi> doth quickly follow? And truly it is ſeen, that in the time of hotteſt perſecutions, the Church hath not been ſo much troubled with this adverſary, as

But let us weigh it in that ballance of the Scripture, and we will find, 1. That ſuch hath been the complaint of the Saints, the <hi>Lord's wounding</hi> them with the wound of a <hi>cruel one;</hi> what a ſtrange query is that in <hi>Lament</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Behold, and conſider, to whom thou haſt done this! ſhall the women eat the fruit of their womb? ſhall the Prieſt and Prophet be ſlain in the ſanctuary of the Lord?</hi> yea, did it not even to <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeem ſtrange, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>That there are juſt men to whom it happeneth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the work of the wicked!</hi> 2.

The word doth alſo ſhew, there is no jar betwixt this, and the tenor of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> which God hath made with his people, to <hi>puniſh their tranſgreſſion with rods,</hi> yea, ſometimes by a ſtrange rod, <hi>while he taketh not his loving kindneſs from them.</hi> And do we not find, that a profitable trial may attend the ſaints, which the world would think a dreadful judgment; for great ſufferings

may be ordered of the Lord, to give ſome great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples thereby; we have heard of the patience of <hi>Job,</hi> and have ſeen the end of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>The groſs falling of thoſe who have ſometimes ſhined with much luſtre in the Church,</hi> may be aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but here alſo we may ſee the ſcripture made out, for it is clear, Firſt, that few inſtances of the moſt eminent of the <hi>Saints,</hi> we have on Scripture-record, but there is ſome particular ſpot and blemiſh alſo noted, a <hi>Noah, Lot, Moſes</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> yea, under the new Teſtament that great <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> whoſe denyal of his maſter is ſet forth, to ſhew how far ſome may fall, whom grace will again reſtore, and make up. 2. It is there clear, that ſome of <hi>underſtanding</hi> do fall for a judgment to <hi>others;</hi> that ſuch who <hi>will ſtumble,</hi> whoſe prejudice at the way of God is their choice, may thus further fall and be broken.—3. The bleſt meaning and intend hereof we may there alſo read to Alarm men to <hi>watchfulneſs,</hi> that ſuch who ſtand <hi>may take heed leſt they fall;</hi> to warrant alſo their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing on the <hi>grace</hi> of God, that none ſhould fear to come in after ſuch eminent examples.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>The contingency of events,</hi> that we ſee many things in ſuch a <hi>caſual</hi> way fall out in the world, as by chance only, without the rational conduct of providence (which doth infallibly direct things to a certain end) this might at the firſt look, put men to a ſtand, yea, would ſeem to give Atheiſts ſome ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow to ſay, <hi>How doth God ſee,</hi> or <hi>doth the God of Jacob regard?</hi> But upon a more ſerious enquiry, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the word over againſt it, O what a ſweet exerciſe ſhould it be to conſider,—1. That though the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, in things here beneath, moveth ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the nature of inferior cauſes, whither neceſſary, free, or contingent, not violencing them, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways making uſe of them but according to their nature, ſo that though the event be neceſſary and

infallible, with a reſpect to the firſt cauſe, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined counſel of God, it is nevertheleſs <hi>contingent</hi> in reſpect of its <hi>neareſt cauſe;</hi> yet, this alſo on the other hand is clear, how theſe ſmalleſt and moſt <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual</hi> motions do certainly fall under that comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive reach of <hi>providence,</hi> that even <hi>a ſparrow falleth not to the ground</hi> by gueſs; <hi>Rebecca</hi> cometh not with her pitcher to the well, nor <hi>Ruth</hi> to glean in <hi>Boaz'</hi>s field at an adventure: but in theſe the providence of God muſt reach its end, and cannot miſcarry.—2. That thoſe things which to us would ſeem moſt caſual, we oft ſee in their tendency and product have been <hi>intended</hi> by the Lord, as a ſpecial <hi>means</hi> for the promoting of <hi>his glory;</hi> wherein ſuch a wonderful meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and uniting of things, in themſelves moſt remote, for that end, may be truly diſcerned, that if prejudice do not ſhut mens eyes, they muſt confeſs, this can be no blind <hi>chance</hi> but ſome high <hi>counſel,</hi> and conduct of the ſame. What would look more contingent, than that <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> was indiſpoſed to ſleep, and could have no reſt in the night? Or that a reflection of the ſun upon the waters, ſhould make them appear as blood to the Children of <hi>Moab?</hi> But we ſee what great things the Lord is thus bringing about. 3. Is it not oft ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt how not the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> caſuality, or circumſtance, providence doth paſs without ſome <hi>improvement</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? yea, that it guideth the ſtroke of a mans ſword in the battel, and directeth the bullet to its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mark, and doth evidently check the ſtars, and control that fatal neceſſity, which we are ready to fear may or will follow their aſpect, and doth even deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thoſe which in themſelves are moſt free &amp; abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, the heart and will of man! Muſt not the crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the cock, &amp; the ſoldiers dividing of Chriſt's gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fall out for an accompliſhment of the <hi>Scripture?</hi> And tho' it was <hi>at a venture,</hi> that that man drew the bow, which ſent <hi>Ahab</hi> to his grave, yet it was no

                     <hi>chance</hi> did direct the arrow between the very joynts of his armour.—4. Amidſt the various emergents and hazards of mens <hi>life,</hi> may not experience tell, that ſurely things contingent are not abandoned to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> but there is a <hi>providence,</hi> which doth <hi>number our hairs,</hi> &amp; without which they <hi>cannot fall to the ground!</hi> O how aſtoniſhing may it be, to think how ſurprizing hazards have been oft obviated; By what unexpected means men have been delivered from violent aſſaults! how help unlooked for hath even come in at an extremity, yea, while their foot was ſlipping even betwixt their falling, and fall, they have been ſurprized with ſome remarkable caſt of mercy.—5. Is it not eaſy to diſcern, how many accidents which ſeem moſt caſual, yet by no humane prudence or induſtry can be prevented, but are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably brought about and guided to fulfil the <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of the word on <hi>ungodly</hi> men! How was <hi>Siſera</hi> led in to the houſe of <hi>Jael,</hi> by other places! How ſhould <hi>Haman's</hi> ſuit for <hi>Mordecai's</hi> death, fall in with that very morning, when the <hi>King's</hi> thoughts were favourable to him! for it might ſeem, had <hi>Haman</hi> been one day ſooner, he would have got his will.</p>
                  <p>(¶) This is a grave and ſerious ſubject, and <hi>in ſuch a day ſhould be much ſtudied,</hi> when ſo many are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to <hi>quarrel at the way of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſuck poyſon,</hi> when prejudices are now ſo univerſally abounding againſt the truth: that we may ſee what a <hi>witneſs</hi> there is, even in the moſt dark and aſtoniſhing ſteps of providence, to the <hi>truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God;</hi> yea how great a confirmation we may thence have of <hi>our faith,</hi> in ſuch ſhaking times, whilſt we ſee how theſe are ſpecial grounds <hi>againſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm,</hi> and a moſt convincing refutation of the ſame, which are ſo much made uſe of to ſtrengthen men <hi>in</hi>
                     <pb n="172" facs="unknown:005185_0207_1016DB59921D11D8"/>
that way. I know the holy <hi>ſovereignty</hi> of God ſhould teach us to adore and keep ſilence, when we cannot fathom the depths of providence; and on this great ſatisfying truth we ſhould ſtay, and fix our ſelves, when things ſeem ſtrange to us, <hi>He is the Lord and with him there is no unrighteouſneſs.</hi> It is ſure, the condition of the damned in hell takes not off that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to declare his faithfulneſs, and adore his unſpotted juſtice: but O then it would ceaſe to be hell, if ſuch a bleſſed frame could have a being there. However, it is a neceſſary and concerning duty, when a matter ſeems too hard for us to underſtand, to <hi>enquire in the ſanctuary;</hi> there is a warrantable ſearch after the works of God that we may know them. Now beſides thoſe inſtances which have been already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I would yet further touch ſome few ſteps of the providence of God, with a ſpecial reſpect to this <hi>preſent time,</hi> which may ſeem very ſtrange, and be amazing; but when bro't to that teſt of divine truth, will be found a moſt ſatisfying confirmation thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may ſeem ſtrange, to ſee <hi>the Church of Chriſt this day ſo univerſally brought low, and in a ſuffering condition, whilſt the whole earth beſides is at ſuch reſt and quiet:</hi> that if we now look any where abroad, affliction and contempt from men is ſeen in a very great meaſure, to attend the profeſſion of godlineſs, but more eſpecially the power thereof; yea that almoſt in every place the Church would ſeem to be upon a decay and a declining, rather than in an advance. I confeſs, this may cauſe great tho'ts of heart, when we conſider that ineſtimable value, he whoſe the Church is, hath put thereon; what <hi>glorious things are ſpoken of her</hi> in the word, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with a reſpect to the <hi>latter days:</hi> and we have judged (I humbly think with a ſafe warrant) that this ſhould be a ſolemn time of fulfilling thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which yet point at a more <hi>univerſal</hi> raiſing
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:005185_0208_1016DBAD8AF80F48"/>
and enlargment of the Church of Chriſt; yea, that in ſo great a meaſure we have ſeen ſome begun per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof, and therefore ſhould conclude, the Lord's work herein cannot halt, until it be at the full height and at the perfect day. <hi>Shall I bring to the birth and not cauſe to bring forth? ſaith the Lord. Shall I cauſe to bring forth, &amp; ſhut the womb? ſaith thy God. Is.</hi> 66. 9. But let us go in to the Scripture, &amp; there enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this, and we will find,—1. How the <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>World,</hi> in that intereſt of their joy &amp; grief, as well as other intereſts, are ſtated in a moſt direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20. <hi>Verily,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall lament and weep, but the world ſhall rejoice.</hi> It ſhould not be expected, thoſe can be at reſt together; ſince the trouble and ſuffering of the Church, it is a part of the world's eaſe and quiet. What a ſolemn jubilee does that cauſe to her adverſaries, when they ſee before them the <hi>dead bodies of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes</hi> of Chriſt! <hi>Revelat.</hi> 11. 10. No ſight more rejoycing to ſuch, becauſe theſe are they who <hi>torment them who dwell in the earth.</hi> But when once the truth caſts off her ſackcloth, and the witneſſes recover their feet; O what a terror doth this cauſe! They are pain'd, yea, their eyes ready to conſume in their eye-holes with bitterneſs and anguiſh, that they have been at ſo ſore work, and done ſo much againſt the Church, and yet cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do her.—2. Should this be more ſtrange now, than at that time when the city of <hi>Shuſan</hi> and whole ſeed of the <hi>Jews</hi> were in perplexity, whilſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Haman</hi> ſat down to feaſt, and rejoice over ſuch a threatned ruin; for this ſeem'd to ſtrike at the root of the Church univerſal! And was not that a broad and dark cloud, when this was writ in the Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, <hi>Zion is a wilderneſs, and Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem a deſolation; yea, could find no reſt, no comforter any where! Lam.</hi> 1. 16, 17. But if ſuch a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:005185_0209_1016DB5B61CD7528"/>
ſeem ſtrange, that the Church now at this day ſhould be with ſo violent and univerſal a ſtorm run down, when ſo great things are <hi>promiſed,</hi> let us conſider <hi>his way,</hi> who by the greateſt downcaſting and ſtraits uſeth to bring about the moſt remarkable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; and do we not know the <hi>Devil</hi> appears with <hi>greateſt wrath,</hi> and raiſeth the foreſt ſtorms, when he knows that <hi>his time is ſhort.</hi>—3. If we conſult the Scripture, we ſhall find, the adverſaries of the Church have <hi>an hour</hi> which is <hi>their hour, and the power of darkneſs;</hi> for their ſunſhine is indeed a black and dark time; and then is there a ſtrange aſtoniſhing concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of outward advantages on their ſide: for they are thus eſtabliſhed for <hi>judgment,</hi> and the wind muſt ſerve, and the tide make, until that <hi>that work</hi> in their hand be <hi>fulfilled.</hi> They could never have been ſuch a a <hi>rod</hi> on the Church, if they were not <hi>appointed</hi> of the Lord for the ſame. Yea, is it not obſervable, whilſt this <hi>their hour</hi> continues, there is then <hi>a power of darkneſs;</hi> ſuch a time, when <hi>that</hi> hath an unuſual force, and would ſeem to carry all before it, hath then a marvelous quick diſpatch in its ſpreading from one place to another, to make a <hi>dark night,</hi> where the Goſpel ſometimes hath had a <hi>bright day!</hi> Yet we ſee how ſuch a ſtrange darkneſs hath but its <hi>hour,</hi> as to the prevalence thereof, even a <hi>ſet time</hi> for the Churches trial; and it is ſuch an eclipſe, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo univerſal, that muſt go over at its appointed period, and give place to light, before which the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can no longer ſtand: and then it ſhall be ſaid to her, who had almoſt abandoned herſelf to ſorrow, <hi>Ariſe and ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen.</hi> 4. Why ſhould we be amazed at this where we may read ſo clearly ſomething of the <hi>Lord's deſign,</hi> even by ſo ſore and univerſal a ſtroak to <hi>appear in his glory, Pſal.</hi> 102. 16. and thus <hi>raiſe his Church</hi> with <hi>an</hi> unſpeakable <hi>advantage</hi> by ſuch a <hi>ſuppoſed

ruin!</hi> The Scripture is in this very manifeſt, that when the Lord is about ſome great building, and hath ſome excellent piece of work to raiſe up, a great deal of rubbiſh and breaking down uſeth to go before. Is it not thus alſo he makes the <hi>ſuffering graces</hi> of his Spirit in his people ſhine forth; that here the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>patience of the Saints</hi> may be witneſſed! yea, ſhould we not know there is in every age a <hi>filling up of the ſufferings of Chriſt</hi> in his people, and a <hi>teſtimony</hi> thus required to his <hi>truth,</hi> which the great witneſs himſelf did once ſeal and confirm with his blood, even he who before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> gave a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and through all ages even to the cloſe of time, there muſt not want ſome witneſſes to the ſame! It is known, how ſome times of the Church are beyond others made remarkable for <hi>ſuffering:</hi> but it is no leſs clear, that in theſe times alſo the <hi>truth</hi> hath had the greateſt victory, and herein a moſt ſpecial clearing up of ſome truths, which the world hath moſt ſtudied to darken. Thus we ſee ſome ages of the Church may have a larger part of this teſtimony aſſigned. Yea, this remark may not only be of ſome different lot and ſervice aſſigned to particular ages, but to particular Churches alſo.—5. If we enquire about this at the Scripture, we ſhall find alſo ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>proportion,</hi> that the turning again of the Churches captivity hath to her former <hi>bondage.</hi> Read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 19, 20. and 55. 13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 39. And you may ſee what an ample reſtoration is there, which as with a meaſuring line is made to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in breadth and length to her former calamity. We find <hi>Zion's</hi> rejoycing, when her <hi>time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment comes from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> muſt reach all her mourners, and be as univerſal as once the cauſe of lamentation was. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66. 10.

<pb n="177" facs="unknown:005185_0212_1016DBB36D917378"/>
that every new aſſault which that grand adverſary makes upon the Church; ſhall ſo far put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her intereſt, and haſten his own ruin. <hi>Bleſſed</hi> are they who are helped in this dark hour to <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>wait</hi> until the <hi>viſion</hi> break out, for it will aſſuredly <hi>ſpeak in the appointed time.</hi>

<pb n="178" facs="unknown:005185_0213_1016DB675DDEC638"/>
and this is ſpecially ſuited thereto, To <hi>go through many tribulations.</hi> It is very conſentaneous to a greater manifeſtation of <hi>grace</hi> under the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, that greater and more frequent trials for its <hi>exerciſe</hi> ſhould alſo be let forth.—(2.) We find, ſuch ſore and uſual aſſaults are not only ſuted to the moſt <hi>excellent condition</hi> of the Church in regard of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual priviledges, but do often befall the moſt <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> of the <hi>ſaints.</hi> Read <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 32. (3.) This remark uſeth not to fail, how every particular Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe ordinary changes and toſſings in her lot, hath alſo ſome more ſolemn <hi>remarkable</hi> trials and ſome <hi>great</hi> aſſault beyond others, and accordingly hath ſome more ſingular breathings and ſun-blinks ſuited thereto.—(4.) We cannot find any ſuch calm and breathing, which hath not been very <hi>ſhort,</hi> if we turn back and trace the hiſtory of the Church in former times, but the <hi>clouds have returned</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>after the rain;</hi> yea, we may obſerve how the moſt excellent Princes and Magiſtrates, under whom the Church hath had ſome ſweet repoſe, have been oft in a very ſhort time taken away, and have but lived a few years.—2. If we wonder at ſuch a piece of the Lord's way, why his Church is thus toſſed, doth not the Scripture ſhew what <hi>need</hi> ſhe hath to be <hi>emptied from veſſel to veſſel;</hi> a long calm being no leſs her hazard, than a ſharp ſtorm; and more cauſe oft to watch over her outward reſt, than weep over her trouble and toſſings. Oh how oft hath the Church loſt more by a few years peace, than a long continued war! yea, the neceſſity of a ſharp winter, for her recovery, hath been ſo diſcernable ere it came, that if it were not for the downbearing of truth, and ſhaking of the faith of the ſaints, the continuance thereof might be almoſt wiſhed as her advantage, at leaſt is to be quietly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto.—3. Doth not the Scripture alſo wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that continued laſting <hi>quarrel,</hi> which is betwixt
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:005185_0214_1016DBB530942C28"/>
the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> and is perpetuated from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation, that time cannot wear it out; ſo that if ſhe had not ſo great a party for her, and an immediate ſupport from heaven, we might find more cauſe to wonder ſhe yet breaths, than to aſk why her breathings are ſo ſhort, when there is ſo great a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er againſt her? O if the Church had not this to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the meſſengers of the nations,</hi> about her ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, <hi>That the Lord hath founded Zion,</hi> ſure that long-breathing deſign for ſo many ages ſhould at laſt have taken place, even to the razing of her foundation.—4. It is clear the moſt ſingular <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and free acceſs thereinto, with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> on the earth, is by the croſs, and in that way wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed; that it muſt be ſaid, if ſuch afflicting times did not oft return upon his people, there would be a ſhut door betwixt the Church and a large part of the Bible, both as to its meaning, and as to its full breaſts of conſolation. Are there not moſt ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing truths there, which the godly cannot reach ſo near &amp; feeling a converſe with, in an outward calm, as under ſome ſharpeſt wreſtlings! O what an excellent commentary hath a ſuffering time given upon theſe, beyond all that ever was written, on ſuch a truth of the Scripture, <hi>Perſecuted, but not forſaken, caſt down, but not deſtroyed, as ſorrowful, yet always rejoicing.</hi> And thus, we ſee how in our ſtumbling at ſuch a providence, we err not knowing the Scriptures, and miſtake our own mercies.—5. Whilſt we ſee thoſe ſhort intervals, which have ſo uſually been under the New Teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt one trial of the Church and another, and the cauſe thereof ſo clear from the word; let us alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what warrant there is yet to expect, before the end a <hi>more ſolemn and remarkable time of the Church's Enlargement;</hi> that not only ſhall be very univerſal in its extent, but a more laſting and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:005185_0215_1016DB693674C008"/>
reſt from the violence of the world, than hath formerly been: which I humbly judge, on clear Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grounds, we are to believe upon the coming of that full ſtroak on <hi>Babylon,</hi> and thoſe ſolemn eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church to Chriſt, which ſeems to be the moſt remarkable period of that time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Church's reign. And though this will not want ſome ſharp trials, and a mixture of outward trouble, yet we find no ground from the Scripture, after the diſcuſſing of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and the throwing down of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> empire, for any remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption and overclouding, or that the Church ſhall have any great aſſault until that final gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world and her forces together, to the laſt <hi>battel of the Lamb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is not this a ſtrange remark likewiſe, which is ſo uſual a complaint through the Church, that with a greater <hi>increaſe of light and knowledge,</hi> there is ſeen a viſible <hi>wearing out of life and power;</hi> and now in theſe more knowing times, there ſhould be ſo much ground to ſay, tenderneſs and the ſerious exerciſe of Godlineſs is more worn out, and in a further decay, than in the times of greater ignorance: let us but look through the reformed Churches at this day, and then turn home to our ſelves, and we ſhall find this remark too ſadly verified; how after a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of knowledge, the truths of God in ſuch a meaſure cleared beyond former ages, it may be ſaid, Oh whither is the life and power of godlineſs gone, and that fervour which once ſo convincingly appeared in following the Lord. We know, there is a ſweet agreement betwixt the Chriſtian's light and life, which have a mutual ſubſerviency to each other, and yet to ſee ſo ſad a jar this day, and ſo little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the one hath to the other, may put us with aſtoniſhment to a ſerious inquiry thereabout; but the ſcripture is clear and makes it plain, if we will
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:005185_0216_1016DBB6CA9CB878"/>
conſider. 1. That there is a time of a people's <hi>eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals</hi> to the Lord, and then the <hi>kindneſs of their youth</hi> and a remarkable <hi>time of love</hi> is ſeen. <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 2. When their affection will be aloft after him; yea, ſuch a ſolemn period of the Church's condition may be ſeen, when it hath not reached that light and knowledge, as after: but do we not alſo find, how rare it is for a people, to hold up at that rate and meaſure in their life and love, which at ſuch times hath appeared, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever advance there may be as to light: Thence we find the Church's holding up with the <hi>name</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of godlineſs <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2. when very ſore ſpent in her <hi>life;</hi> yea, this decay oft upon ſuch an unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible growth, that it will be hard to get ſuch convinced thereof, and <hi>remember whence they are fallen.</hi>—2. If we will aſk at the ſcripture, it will alſo ſhew that judicial tendency, which <hi>light not imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

O at what a rate doth it run down and ſtupify the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence! that thus men are not only more deadned, but bcome the more dead and blind that they were once enlightned.—3. May we not thence know how this is one of the <hi>Devil's</hi> greateſt engines he makes uſe of, to turn men's light againſt their life and tenderneſs, even to <hi>incite</hi> them, from that excellent diſcovery of the <hi>grace of God,</hi> unto <hi>wantonneſs.

and native tendency is to <hi>humble</hi> and abaſe, being thus impoiſoned do's work the contrary effect, even to <hi>ſwell</hi> men and puff them up; to oppoſe thoſe gifts againſt the Church, which are given of the Lord for its edification, and for defence of, the goſpel! Thus we find it clear, when <hi>light</hi> hath made a further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the Church, the Devil is there at work to deſtroy <hi>love,</hi> by many bitter, contentious Debates, where the intereſt may be oft ſeen more perſonal, to wit, men's repute and credit, than the intereſt of God and his truth. I am far from any intended reflection on that grave and neceſſary duty of appearing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the truth, and men's ſtating themſelves in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to thoſe who are its adverſaries; a quarrel, wherein they ſhould know neither friend nor brother: for this is to ſtand in the breach, when it is aſſaulted, to <hi>contend for the faith.</hi> O bleſſed contention, where ſuch with that excellent man <hi>Melanchton</hi> can ſay, <hi>Non quoero gloriam propriam, ſed veritatem.</hi>—Though this is a very ſad and threatning ſymptom that <hi>night</hi> is coming on a Church where the <hi>light</hi> ſhines, but the <hi>heat</hi> and warming influence thereof is gone; yet here is a riddle, we find the Scripture do's wonderfully unfold, how the Lord makes things bring forth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effects, and cauſes a remarkable <hi>conſumption,</hi> that ſeems to reach the Church in her inward and vital parts, reſolve in an <hi>overflowing with righteouſneſs. Is.</hi> 10. 22. yea, thus lets us ſee a people ſo far ſpent in life and ſpirituality, that <hi>the things which remain are ready to die,</hi> whilſt even there, the Lord is purſuing their recovery. It is herein he makes his grace marvellous, to order his people's raiſing to be from ſo low a ſtep of their condition, and cauſe his Church when bro't to a <hi>ſmall remnant,</hi> to <hi>take root down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and bring forth fruit upward. Is.</hi> 37. 31. It would ſeem a ſtrange connection, but not ſtrange to the grace of God, <hi>Ps.</hi> 102. that <hi>the time of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring

Zion even that ſet time,</hi> ſhould find her in <hi>a heap of ſtones and rubbiſh;</hi> yea, that a reviving and the breaking out of her day begins there with the <hi>weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of her friends over her ruins. I ſhall further add, with reſpect to the <hi>preſent time,</hi> we may believe on very ſure grounds, that <hi>godlineſs</hi> and <hi>the power</hi> thereof will yet break out in the world, though it were at the loweſt ebb, yea, as at its laſt breathing; that little ſpark now under aſhes muſt aſſuredly revive and blow up to a flame; yea, ſend forth its heat to warm the nations; For on ſolid grounds we may thus reaſon, if ſuch a death-like decay had a reſpect only to ſome <hi>particular</hi> Church, and if this withering, abatement and languiſhing of the exerciſe of grace, were confined but to a corner, it might be a ſad preſage, that their ſun, when ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined and gone down, were near to the ſetting: but ſince this ſeems to be a <hi>conſumption over the whole earth,</hi> a matter of lamentation and a ſpreading com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, through the whole reformed Church, we may look on it as a very promiſing ground, of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and hope of a recovery for if that be ſure, the <hi>Church univerſal</hi> cannot die under ſuch a diſeaſe, it is alſo ſure, <hi>this ſickneſs is not unto death;</hi> yea, ſo remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able an <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>power of godlineſs,</hi> as is this day through the world, we may judge a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing preſage of ſome, more univerſal out breaking of the ſame, wherein God will be ſeen by ſome bleſſed <hi>ſurpriſal</hi> in a very immediate way: for <hi>there is hope of this tree,</hi> which in a ſpecial way he had himſelf planted, <hi>that it ſhall grow,</hi> though now cut down, <hi>by the ſcent of waters,</hi> even by the <hi>river the ſtreams whereof makes glad the city of God;</hi> which can in <hi>old age</hi> cauſe her to <hi>bring forth fruit.</hi> O what life is there in the Church of Chriſt, when it ſeems to be buried! for ſhe is in the root, that cannot dry up; &amp; herein muſt his promiſe &amp; his peoples praiſe

meet, that her <hi>dry bones ſhall flouriſh as a green herb,</hi> there can be now no leſs appearance of this, than at that time when <hi>the Lord turned again the captivity of his people,</hi> which was ſo little expected, <hi>Ps.</hi> 126. that they knew not whether it was a <hi>dream,</hi> or real. It may indeed be a very humbling diſcovery, that we muſt ſay, <hi>our ruin is of our ſelves;</hi> yet muſt it not ruin our hope, ſince in theſe <hi>great things</hi> which the Lord hath done for the Church, the greatneſs of his <hi>power</hi> hath not been more clearly witneſſed, than the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſovereignty of his <hi>grace,</hi> that men may ſee, <hi>this is the Lord's doing,</hi> and ſhould be <hi>marvellous in their eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. May it not ſeem ſtrange, and be matter of aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that the <hi>great men</hi> of the earth, and ſuch who ſit in the <hi>place of judgment,</hi> are uſually found to be greateſt <hi>adverſaries</hi> to the <hi>Church;</hi> yea, it is too well known, that magiſtracy (ſo excellent an ordinance of God) hath been ſo far perverted, that even under the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtrate the Church of Chriſt hath ſuffered more ſince firſt breaking out than from any other quarter, this indeed may ſeem marvellous; I do not deny, there have been great men in the world, who have no leſs outſhined others in fervour and zeal for truth, than in their place and quality. But oh we may ſay, an <hi>age</hi> brings forth few ſuch; and that which <hi>Salvian</hi> ſays of his time, hath been a true remark in moſt ages of the world, and too frequently ſeen, that the contempt upon religion by thoſe who were in greateſt power had this effect, <hi>Ut mali cogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur eſſe, ne viles habeantur.</hi> I confeſs this may cauſe wonder, (if we conſider for what end the great Law-giver hath deſigned that ordinance) how men ſhould ſo far counteract his intereſt, from whom they derive their power, and for being ſubſervient thereto have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it: ſure the doctrine of the Church of Chriſt can give no ground of quarrel: &amp; its ſtrange theſe ſhould, expect from others homage &amp; ſubjection, who turn the

                     <hi>ſeat of judgment</hi> to be a <hi>grievous yoke,</hi> and deny their ſubjection ſo avowedly to the great judge: O how ſad is it, that none are oft ſuch a <hi>terror to the godly,</hi> ſuch a <hi>ſupport to evil doers,</hi> as Magiſtrates, and the great men of the world ſo uſually found to be the greateſt examples of wickedneſs! This ſhould indeed be matter of lamentation, yea, that thoſe are oft times advanced, who have nothing to commend them, but ſome advance beyond others in a higher meaſure of impiety. But we muſt go to the Scripture, and there inquire which will ſhew, (1.) That it is not ſtrange, though <hi>iniquity have a throne,</hi> under whoſe ſhadow miſchief may not only ſhelter, but come that length to be <hi>fram'd into a law. Ps.</hi> 94. 20. yea, it muſt not be ſtrange, that the <hi>adverſaries</hi> of the truth be among <hi>the chief</hi> of the time; which complaint we find <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 5. The world is not yet cured of that <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> of which the Prophet ſpeaks with amazement, <hi>Ps.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>why the Kings and rulers of the earth ſhould attempt a vain thing,</hi> to ruin the Church, and make his decree void, who by his word created the world. We may ſee, it is not of <hi>late</hi> the ſervants of Chriſt have been convened before rulers in defence of the truth, and have ſuffered by the law, where the crime was, their adherence to the expreſs command of the great law-giver. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 12. It is alſo clear, the Kings of the earth for many ages have amidſt all their private differences <hi>with one conſent</hi> agreed to <hi>make war with the lamb,</hi> and <hi>give their ſtrength</hi> for upholding <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt;</hi> yet is this nothing elſe, but what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath foretold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. It was written of an excellent man in the days of <hi>Phocas,</hi> that after ſome humble expoſtulating with the Lord, why he ſet up ſo vile a wretch in the higheſt place of power that he had this return, <hi>quia non inveni pejorem.</hi> Herein is the way of the Lord unſpotted, how ſad ſo ever it be <hi>in it</hi> ſelf, that thoſe who ſhould <hi>execute judgment for
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:005185_0221_1016DB72D89F8720"/>
the oppreſſed,</hi> are in his holy diſpleaſure made the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of his judgments on men, and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the greateſt oppreſſors (2.) If this be ſtrange to us, do not the Scripture prevent our ſtumbling, by a moſt ſweet and choice antidote, that <hi>when we ſee the oppreſſion of the poor,</hi> and ſuch a wrathful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect rulers uſually have on the Church of God, <hi>we ſhould not marvel,</hi> or be much moved thereat, even when we ſee thoſe whom <hi>death</hi> hath pluckt away, and with ſhame rolled in the grave, ſtill <hi>return</hi> with the ſame reſemblance in their <hi>ſucceſſors,</hi> and piety in all ages run down by power: For it is written, that <hi>he who is higher then the higheſt doth regard the ſame, Eccl.</hi> 5. 8. O how far are they below God, yea, infinitely below him, who are higheſt among men! hath not their violence and oppreſſion of the Church <hi>him</hi> for a <hi>witneſs,</hi> whom they muſt alſo have for a <hi>judge?</hi> And the further they ſeem raiſed above human reach, they lie more near to ſome immediate ſtroak of a divine hand; that when there is <hi>no reprover</hi> on earth, none there to give their cruelty againſt the Church a check, <hi>he ſits in heaven,</hi> who <hi>laughs them to ſcorn;</hi> which they ſhall find to be ſad earneſt, when <hi>he ſpeaks to them in his wrath,</hi> and <hi>vexes them in his ſore diſpleaſure.</hi>—(3.) Does not the Scripture witneſs the Lord's bleſſed <hi>deſign</hi> in this, to make his Church <hi>thrive another way,</hi> when ſhe is deſtitute of the help and countenance of civil authority, and thus lead her in to <hi>him, who hath the key of David, that opens and none can ſhut,</hi> unto him who is a <hi>known refuge for the oppreſſed?</hi> It is here he declares himſelf to be <hi>God,</hi> and the greatneſs of his power who can keep her alive, and preſerve his intereſt in a deſtroying flame, and under a cruel oppreſſing Magiſtrate; yea, thus cauſe her to <hi>flouriſh in his days,</hi> and <hi>have peace in his reign,</hi> even under the grievous reign of her adverſaries. Do we not likewiſe find (<hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 36.) the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:005185_0222_1016DBC2D00C75A0"/>
Church's diſtreſs there and oppreſſion from her ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, makes them reſolve in a more near tie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with God? which is ſeen in the laſt verſe, <hi>And becauſe of this we make a ſure covenant, &amp;c.</hi> O bleſſed violence and oppreſſion, that lands here, where the ſtorm drives to ſuch an anchor, as a further cleaving to the Lord, and ſurrender of themſelves to him!—(4.) As the Scripture prevents men's ſtumbling at this ordinary ſuffering of the Church under Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, it does alſo witneſs the <hi>Lord's contending</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkably <hi>againſt theſe</hi> on ſuch an account; and clearly ſheweth, that no human greatneſs can ſecure from him who <hi>cuts off the ſpirit of Princes, and is terrible to the Kings of the earth;</hi> conſider <hi>Ps.</hi> 2. 9. and 93. 4. It is here we may read the cauſe of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Kingdoms and ſtates, that are ſo frequent in the world. Whatever influence perſonal intereſts ſeem to have, there is a holy revenging God, and his arm made bare therein upon the quarrel of his Church that he may <hi>recompenſe tribulation to thoſe who have troubled her.</hi> None needs wonder, that flouriſhing ſtates are broken in ſuch a quarrel; to ſee the ſupreme head of the Church (<hi>that in all things he may have the preheminence) wound the head over many countrys,</hi> and <hi>rule the nations with an iron rod,</hi> yea, turn great men out of their grandeur and authority, and and throw them down: for the cauſe is obvious, they keep no bounds and marches, with the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt, but will be over him &amp; invade his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, until he who muſt reign, and have all dominion and power ſubjected to him, carry that war back upon themſelves, and ſtand up againſt ſuch evil neighbours, for his own right; for which he will <hi>ſtrike thorough Kings in the Day of his wrath,</hi> yea, purſue the race and ſeed of ſuch oppreſſors, the father and the children, as a ſtanding quarrel from generation to generation.—(5.) It is ſure, <hi>corrupt Magiſtracy</hi> is one
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:005185_0223_1016DB74E6058540"/>
of the <hi>great plagues of God</hi> on the world; wherein his unſpotted righteouſneſs, and the provoking cauſe from men, may be ſeen in the Scripture; that when ſuch will throw off <hi>his yoke,</hi> and quarrel with his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in ſubjection to which their liberty lies, they ſhould have one <hi>more grievous,</hi> and unſufferable, wreathed on them, and be delivered up to the hands of ſuch cruel exactors. I muſt here ſay, the Lord do's viſibly contend, by ſuch a ſtroke, with that <hi>exceſſive</hi> flattery and reſpect the nations gives their rulers, that <hi>blind</hi> obedience they give, contrary to the expreſs will of the Law-giver, by a willing following of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; and thus writes that <hi>

                  <p n="5">5. This alſo ſeems ſtrange and is a very ſhaking thing, to ſee ſome of <hi>greateſt repute</hi> and <hi>eminency in the Church,</hi> who have been ſingularly <hi>uſeful</hi> to engage others in the way of the Lord, <hi>change their principles with the time,</hi> and turn at laſt in <hi>oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereto; yea, make it their work to <hi>caſt down</hi> what once with great zeal they ſeemed to <hi>build;</hi> I confeſs, this may give ſad ground of ſtumbling, and nothing Atheiſm takes more advantage of, to queſtion the truth of all Religion, whether there be any thing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a humane intereſt in it, when men's light in the matters of God and the doctrine of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are found ſo croſs to themſelves with the changes of the time. <hi>Bleſſed are they who are not offended at Chriſt</hi> becauſe of this; but let us conſult the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

and then inſtead of being ſhaken or brangled we ſhall find this ſuch a ſpecial confirmation of the truth, that if it were not thus, men might rather queſtion the ſame. For, (1.) Such a ſhaking trial is clearly <hi>foretold,</hi> from croſs tides of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> that ſhould be within the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 14. yea, a warning given of thoſe who <hi>handle the word deceitfully,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. by accommodating it to their private intereſt and deſign, and a corrupt Application thereof: for when men do once eſtabliſh the Concluſion before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, for compliance with a ſinful courſe, they are then at work to <hi>wreſt the Scripture</hi> by miſapplying it. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. which is indeed to oppoſe the truth againſt it ſelf, and ſute it to their biaſs, that they may ſalve ſuch a viſible oppoſition betwixt them and themſelves in their way and practice. And thus what ever <hi>fair ſhew they make in the fleſh,</hi> they expoſe the word, and their parts and abilities in handling of it, to <hi>ſale</hi> (O an accurſed ſale and merchandize!) Now if this ſeem ſtrange and be ſtumbling, that amongſt the diſpenſers of the myſteries of God, and of greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the Church, ſuch ſhould be found, read 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. And you will there ſee the cauſe why many <hi>corrupt the word,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>not in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and as in the ſight of God</hi> therein, which is abſolutely required to qualify a faithful Miniſter of Chriſt. Oh! The want of that candor and uprightneſs of heart is a worm, which lies hid at the root of all their other parts, and as a dead corrupting fly in ſo excellent a box of oyntment. Thus we may ſee, this is ſo far from being a cauſe of ſtumbling at the truth, that it do's moſt convincingly fulfil and and verifie the ſame. (2.) When we have ſo ſad a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery in the Church, have we not this antidote like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe from the Scripture, <hi>not to be ſhaken or moved thereat, Heb.</hi> 13. 9.

the ſoul, though we ſhould be left alone in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty. <hi>The teſtimony of God is ſure,</hi> and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable; and <hi>he is true, though all men ſhould be liars.</hi> We muſt have the <hi>perſons</hi> of none <hi>in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which hath ſo uſual a tendency to bribe the judgment, and betray the truth: but <hi>though an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle or an Angel from heaven</hi> ſhould come to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Scripture of God, we ought in ſo far to <hi>let him be accurſed.</hi>—(3.) Here alſo is the holy counſel and deſign of the Lord made known, <hi>that thoſe who are approved may be made manifeſt;</hi> and ſuch have an opportunity to diſcover themſelves, <hi>who turn aſide to crooked paths,</hi> and tread in the dark to the prejudice of the truth. <hi>Ps.</hi> 125. 5. They may <hi>dig very deep to hide</hi> their oppoſition to God, not only from others, but even from themſelves: but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence herein hath a deeper reach, and <hi>enſnares them in the work of their own hands;</hi> yea, doth thus <hi>bring them forth with the workers of iniquity,</hi> and as his greateſt adverſaries, who wound and betray his intereſt under that maſk, and diſguiſe of a friend, this is indeed a preventing mercy to the Church, whoſe hurt and hazard hath been more from theſe who walk under a cover then any other party; and here is the <hi>counſel of the Lord</hi> ſhew'd, that when a piercing <hi>trial</hi> comes, which will <hi>go thorow the ſoul like a ſword, the thoughts of many hearts may be then diſcovered.</hi> There is a falling in of many with the Church under a calm, who muſt fall <hi>off</hi> with a ſtorm.

We may truly ſay, it is more threatning then ſword, famine or peſtilence, againſt a nation. It is a ſtrange ground, which is given of the <hi>departure</hi> of theſe <hi>from the faith,</hi> who were once in repute of the Church, yea, of the breaking out of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in the world, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 12. that it was <hi>to puniſh them who believed not the truth,</hi> and would not embrace the ſame; O it is a ſad and dreadful time to live in, where ſuch offences abound! for it clearly ſhews a <hi>judicially</hi> plaguing time upon the Church, and ſome <hi>great abuſe</hi> of the Goſpel which hath gone before.—(5.) When this ſeems ſtrange to us, ſhould we not learn to adore and juſtify him, who thus <hi>ſtains the pride of all fleſh</hi> and will <hi>ſilence the confidence or boaſting of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> that the Church may know where <hi>her ſtrength</hi> lys, this is a remark, though ſad, which ſeldom fails, that the greateſt endowments and gifts, where men are ſwell'd &amp; lift up therewith, have a more eaſie and native byaſs <hi>againſt</hi> the truth, then <hi>for</hi> it, and threatens the Churches hazard, more than any advantage the exerciſe

of theſe gifts can promiſe and the greater <hi>repute</hi> men walk under, where humility keeps not low, lays them the more near ſome humbling ſtroak, to bring them low, ere they go off the ſtage, <hi>that no fleſh may glory in his preſence,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 26. We muſt ſay, the greateſt <hi>Hero's</hi> in the Church of Chriſt, who have ſhined, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their ſetting, moſt brightly, have been alſo the moſt <hi>humble.</hi>—(6.) As it is clear, there is no jar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Scripture and this, but it is ſo great a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> thereof, that it ſhould further ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh us in the way of the Lord (for the <hi>falling off</hi> of ſuch from the truth is a trial moſt expreſly foretold, and a convincing witneſs to the truth of the Scripture) ſo this alſo muſt be granted, that <hi>there are Miniſters and watchmen</hi> in the Church of Chriſt, in all ages, found <hi>faithful to their Maſters intereſt,</hi> who have been not only helped to confeſs the truth, and <hi>deliver the counſel of God</hi> to the World, but to witneſs their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to and perſwaſion of it by <hi>ſuffering.</hi> O can the World debate this, that ſuch in the worſt of times are found to drive a treaty of reconciliation betwixt Chriſt and ſinners, who are in earneſt, and have a weight of that work on them, without reſpect to outward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement? O happy Servants of ſo great a Maſter who conſider that they ſhine with borrowed light, and derive all from him, whether as to grace or gifts, that therein they may return to him again, by a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full improvement of their talent; who reckon they cannot be low, where he is exalted; they cannot loſe where the gain is his; but in this doth rejoice, to ſee <hi>him increaſe,</hi> and his Kingdom on an advance, though <hi>they decreaſe,</hi> and be darkened with the brightneſs of his riſing!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I know this is an aſtoniſhing thing, which many pretend a cauſe for ſtumbling, to <hi>ſee how ſome have walked, and at what a rate, under a profeſſion of godlineſs,</hi> and <hi>for ſo long a time</hi> have had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

But oh this is not more ſtrange, than true; yea, many ſuch pretenders are, and will be, within the pale of the viſible Church. And is there not a <hi>divine hand</hi> marvelouſly oft ſeen in <hi>rending that vail,</hi> and <hi>bringing thoſe forth to the light,</hi> in ſuch a way as may witneſs that this is from the Lord! Now there is no ground of challenge or reflection here, on his holy &amp; unſpotted way, or the reality of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, if we will but ſeriouſly enquire at the Scripture; where we have this (1.) expreſly <hi>foretold,</hi> that men ſhould <hi>have a form of godlineſs,</hi> and <hi>deny the power thereof.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>profeſs to know God,</hi> being <hi>abominable, diſobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.

You know how <hi>the man of ſin</hi> did firſt ſtep in; was he not thus maſked? and is not the Scripture clear, that to ſeek a Church free of ſuch a mixture out of heaven, is to ſeek that which we will never find, for it is there only, <hi>no unclean thing can enter.</hi>—(2.) Do's not this bleſſed record of the ſcripture ſhew, with what <hi>ſingular art</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> ſuch may act that part, and with <hi>Jehu</hi> enquire, <hi>if the man's heart be right,</hi> whilſt his own is moſt <hi>falſe;</hi> what a ſtrange confidence will theſe have, who <hi>glory in appearance, and not in heart?</hi> Will they not <hi>cry unto God,</hi> and <hi>make mention of him, but not in truth.

Yea, ſhould we wonder, though ſuch be found, who can maſk their private intereſt with ſuch an appearance, even whilſt they ſeek a rule for their religion out of <hi>Matchiavel,</hi> but not out of the Bible!—(3.) If the length that theſe may come, ſeem ſtrange, will you conſult the Scripture, which goes as great a length in its <hi>diſcovery,</hi> and you will know how deep it works, ſometimes not at an ordinary rate, but they will invite the world to <hi>ſee their zeal for God,</hi> who dare not endure the view of their own conſcience. Therein you may find an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and <hi>one of the</hi> twelve, and yet <hi>a Devil.</hi> To witneſs this, ſhould be no reflection on the Church of Chriſt, though an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Miniſter thereof be found rotten and unſound, who hath made <hi>a great ſhew in the fleſh.</hi>—(4.) Do's the Scripture <hi>allow</hi> or <hi>flatter any in ſuch a way?</hi> You cannot there have one line for its encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but whilſt human law do's not reach this, divine Law moſt ſeverely threatens, <hi>Joh</hi> 8. 13. &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 15, &amp;c. And there you may ſee it in its own colour, how horrid a thing it is, which the more near it do's approach Religion (that is ſo excellent and lovely in itſelf) this falſe ſhew thereof is the more hateful and loathſome.

lie, becauſe a lying to the God of truth. (5.) You cannot challenge the <hi>Church</hi> and followers of Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>by them</hi> any ſuch thing is <hi>owned</hi> or <hi>juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified:</hi> but it may be ſeen, what an <hi>offence</hi> and <hi>wound</hi> ſuch a diſcovery will prove, to theſe. It is indeed a cauſe of grief, but no cauſe of reflection on the truth of God: for in ſo far this is verified, <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 29.—(6.) Is not that <hi>horrid and black roll</hi> mention'd by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 3. claſpt as it were betwixt theſe two, <hi>a form of godlineſs,</hi> but <hi>denying the power thereof?</hi> It is not ſtrange, when Religion is attended with much <hi>power</hi> in a place, that <hi>hypocriſy</hi> is found there alſo: but it is clear, what remarkable <hi>diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> have been made thereof, that ſeldom ſuch who have moſt induſtriouſly ſtudied that accurſed art, have gone to the grave under this cover; though I deny not but ſome may. I muſt further add, that ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial incitement and concurrence of the <hi>devil</hi> is here oft very manifeſt and <hi>his power</hi> as remarkably put forth, as in any <hi>luſt of the fleſh,</hi> to put ſome forward on ſuch a deſign; yea, even may be ſubſervient to them in the exerciſe of common gifts, that may deceive for the time very diſcerning Chriſtians. I cannot queſtion the truth of this, having ground to inſtance ſuch, who have been in an expreſs <hi>covenant with Satan,</hi> and have after acknowledged his help and aſſiſtance, for their dexterous managing ſo dreadful a deſign: if you think this ſtrange, you may conſider, that the <hi>devil himſelf is transformed to an Angel of light.</hi> But it is well, the groſſeſt defilement of men can no ways ſtain Religion, and the way of the Lord, which is pure and undefiled.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Thoſe ſad <hi>jarrs</hi> and <hi>diviſions,</hi> which are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, may ſeem very ſtrange, and be the cauſe of ſtumbling &amp; offence to many? that whilſt the <hi>World</hi> is at ſuch an agreement, and of one
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:005185_0231_1016DB8149CBE388"/>
mind to oppoſe the truth, thoſe are oft found at war, moſt bitterly contending amongſt themſelves, even thoſe who ſhould <hi>ſtand in the breach,</hi> for the truth and in defence of the Goſpel, the <hi>fellow-ſervants</hi> at ſtrife and <hi>ſmiting one another,</hi> when they ſhould be <hi>ſtriving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about their Maſter's work.</hi> I confeſs, this is ſad, and is a rock whereon many have ſplit; of which they have made that uſe to a further heightening of their prejudice againſt the truth: Yea, it is ſtrange that this deſtroying plague doth ſo obſervably attend any peace or calm, that the Church hath in her outward condition. But there is no cauſe for ſuch ſtumbling; if we will allow it ſome ſerious thoughts, it may rather help to fix and eſtabliſh us in the way of the Lord, and in ſtead of being a poiſon, may be an effectual antidote againſt the ſame, I mean the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm</hi> of the time, which pretends ſo great an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from this. For the Scripture is clear, (1.) Tho' it is a ſore ſtroke on the Church, and the moſt ſad departure of God from a People, which we have upon divine record, we find uſually attends them in ſuch a torn and divided caſe; yea, though in all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of after-times, this may be traced in the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a judgment, as a very immediate forerunner thereof: <hi>yet, have we no warrant to expect the Church militant ſhall be in that condition in which there ſhall be no ſuch diſcord and breach.</hi> No, that is <hi>heaven,</hi> and it is there only that perfect peace and concord will be found; read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 5. And what an <hi>early</hi> trial was this to the Church which did occaſion that grave and ſolemn meeting of the <hi>Apoſtles and Elders (Acts</hi> 15.) to let us ſee how the Lord can ſerve himſelf of the greateſt evil for the advantage of his truth.—(2.) There is no cauſe of challenge here or reflecting on the truth, whatever be on thoſe who profeſs it, ſince the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhews <hi>that we know but in part,</hi> and <hi>propheſie in
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:005185_0232_1016DBD2CB3A4480"/>
part,</hi> and ſuch a prevailing mixture of corruption, that <hi>ſome will preach Chriſt out of ſtrife and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not ſincerely. Phil.</hi> 1. 15. Yea, whilſt there are ſuch different ſizes amongſt the Saints, that thoſe who <hi>eat not,</hi> are ready to <hi>judge them who eat,</hi> and thoſe who <hi>eat,</hi> are ready to <hi>deſpiſe him who eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</hi> (3.) If we conſult the Scripture, we ſhall find that <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>concord within the Church,</hi> which is ſo excellent in it ſelf &amp; deſirable, muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely qualified with a reſpect to <hi>holineſs. Heb.</hi> 12. 14. For elſe ſuch an agreement would not be the true peace of the Church, but her plague. And is not that <hi>wiſdom, which is from above, firſt pure,</hi> and <hi>then peaceable?</hi> It is ſure, they are its beſt friends, who have leaſt latitude to take or give in the intereſt of <hi>truth:</hi> but it is oft found, how ſuch indirect tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perings for <hi>peace,</hi> have in the judgment of the Lord cauſed a further breach. There is no true jar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the zeal of God, and an ardent deſire and endeavour for peace, but what our corruption cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. O this is a bleſt <hi>peace-maker,</hi> who can go the furtheſt length to yield in <hi>his own things,</hi> whether credit or private intereſt, yea, overlook the moſt ſharp perſonal reflections, to promote that excellent deſign; but hath nothing to yield or quit upon his <hi>Maſter's intereſt,</hi> and can <hi>reſiſt,</hi> whoſoever they be that would prejudice this, <hi>even to their face!</hi> have we not that Heroick practice of the Apoſtle (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 5.) upon divine record to this day? <hi>to whom we gave place no not for an hour, that the truth of the goſpel might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with you.</hi> Is not that alſo a ſpecial remark, that <hi>thoſe who cauſe diviſion in the Church,</hi> &amp; were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>to be noted (Rom.</hi> 16. 17.) it was <hi>thoſe who did oppoſe the doctrine</hi> of the Church? For it is men's fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off from the <hi>truth,</hi> which is indeed the cauſe of a <hi>ſchiſm</hi> and rent; but not their adherence to it, tho' for this they ſhould be <hi>men of contention</hi> and look't
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:005185_0233_1016DB84E7216908"/>
on as <hi>ſigns and wonders</hi> in the time.—(4.) Whatever advantage ſome may take to challenge the way of the Lord, from theſe breaches, I am ſure, they cannot deny, there is a <hi>fellowſhip</hi> and <hi>concord</hi> in the Church of Chriſt <hi>beyond any in the world.</hi> There is a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſaints, even here, <hi>with one heart and mind;</hi> yea, in ſuch a meaſure as may ſhew the world this is a <hi>bond</hi> that exceeds the moſt near and ſtrait ties of natural relations. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 3. 16. and truly every jar and difference amongſt the followers of Chriſt, make not a breach.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I know, that this will ſeem ſtrange and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way of the Lord, that when the Church from <hi>her adverſaries</hi> without is oppreſſed and brought low, <hi>his hand</hi> in a very immediate way alſo is ſo <hi>heavy,</hi> yea, ſeems more ſore upon his people, than the hand of men; and do's even by ſome ſad ſtrokes in their private intereſts, and upon their perſons, appear more remarkably againſt <hi>them,</hi> than againſt any <hi>others.</hi> this may occaſion <hi>great thoughts of heart,</hi> when we conſider that tenderneſs which the Lord doth witneſs towards his people, that he <hi>ſtirs not up all his wrath</hi> nor <hi>will lay upon them above that they can bear,</hi> but <hi>ſtays his rough wind in the day of the eaſt-wind,</hi> and hath promiſed to be <hi>a ſanctuary,</hi> and <hi>hiding place,</hi> when they are <hi>ſcattered</hi> by men, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 16. And with another party the Church might debate, yea, hold her own with her greateſt adverſaries: But oh! it is time to flee, and there can be no ſtanding, where the <hi>Almighty</hi> purſues. There is then true cauſe of fear and terror, when <hi>he</hi> becomes his people's party! Yet let us conſult the Scripture, that great interpreter of providence, &amp; of every ſtep of the way and procedure of the Lord with his Church; and it will let us ſee, (1.) That it is no ſtrange caſe, or untroden path, but we may find the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 17. at ſuch a grievous <hi>cry, Be not a terror to me, thou art my hope
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:005185_0234_1016DBD45AB52880"/>
in the evil day.</hi> And had not the Church the ſame cauſe of complaint, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 14, 16. <hi>that the Lord ſeem'd to wound her, with the wound of an enemy, and the ſtroke of a cruel one.</hi> It was the appearance of this, that was a very ſad addition to her trial beyond any other thing, <hi>Is.</hi> 63. 10. that they found <hi>the Lord turn'd to be their enemy,</hi> and in an immediate way ſeem to <hi>fight againſt them.</hi>—(2.) Do's not the Scripture ſhew that the <hi>rod</hi> may have a <hi>dreadful appearance,</hi> and the way of the Lord by ſome ſtrange and ſingular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in dealing with his people may be matter of amazement, when yet he deſigns a further <hi>increaſe</hi> of their <hi>grace;</hi> yea, their <hi>trial,</hi> more than their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? This is indeed one of the <hi>deeps</hi> of providence, which we have diſcovered in, <hi>Job</hi> 1, &amp; 2. Chap. how by a divine permiſſion <hi>Satan</hi> may very effectualy concur in a ſtroke on the Church, or ſome particular Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and thus cauſe ſtrange concurrence of bitter things, that in ſuch a caſe the hand of the Lord would ſeem very <hi>terrible,</hi> whilſt he only minds his people's <hi>trial:</hi> and it is clear, that the <hi>fiery trial,</hi> mentioned by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12. may have ſuch ſtrange and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular circumſtances, that the godly will be at a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if ſuch did ever befal others, and yet you ſee it there held forth more as a ground of <hi>joy,</hi> than of fear. O how deep, in afflicting times of the Church, may the plot and contrivance of the Devil be! which yet in the holy counſel of the Lord is oft forced to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt its own byaſs, &amp; to bring forth the very contrary effect!—(3.) If we underſtand the Scripture, we may there know, how the trial of the Church hath its <hi>appointed bounds</hi> and <hi>meaſure;</hi> yea, by ſome remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſteps will grow that length, and have ſuch an advance, until it ſurround them on all hands, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2. 22. <hi>Thou haſt called my terrors round about, as in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn day:</hi> Yet, when it is ſo, we find it is not <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe,</hi> but may be <hi>needful</hi> for the Church and

it is not then ſtrange tho' that ſad <hi>Wo, Amos</hi> 6. 6. do ſo far reach them, as their perſonal <hi>eaſe</hi> makes them <hi>forget the affliction of Joſeph.</hi> For thus the righteous God, ſutes their ſtroke to the ſin; and keeps ſuch a proportion, that a light burden of the care of the <hi>Church</hi> ſhould make their care <hi>otherways</hi> abound, and in their own things preſs them with much trouble, when theſe go betwixt them and the intereſt of Chriſt.

But yet in the <hi>cloſe</hi> of theſe judgments, even when a Church may ſeem quite conſumed, and her ſtrength worn out, have we not there ſome ground of hope, that the Lord may prevent his people's thoughts, by as marvellous, as immediate <hi>reſtoring</hi> providences when he ſees their power is gone, and that there is none to help? yea, is it not eaſy with him, and like his way, <hi>to return and reſtore what the former years have taken away,</hi> by the locuſt and caterpiller, &amp;c. which he had ſent amongſt them? <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. 25.</p>

light, ſome ſpecial diſcoveries of God, after known convictions and wreſtlings of conſcience, yea, after ſolemn engagements and their declared reſolution to follow the Lord in his way, have yet come ſuch a length and degree in a deliberate reſiſting and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves to him and his truth, without the leaſt appearance of a check or trouble! I confeſs, this is one of the <hi>marvellous</hi> things of God, and a very viſible demonſtration of his being, who hath ſuch a dominion over the ſoul, both in its hardning and ſoftening: but no cauſe to <hi>ſtumble</hi> hereat. It does truly call us to fear, and is a ſtroke that may force on Atheiſts the awful conviction of a Deity; or though it is not felt by thoſe who are under the ſame, becauſe the want of ſenſe and feeling is a part of that diſeaſe, yet all who look on (if they did not ſhut their own eyes) may learn to know that this is the very <hi>work of God,</hi> and a piece of <hi>his judgment which be makes known in the earth.</hi> But let us aſk the Scripture, &amp; we ſhall find, inſtead of any ground for ſtumbling, what a ſpecial confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this ſhould be of the truth: ſince it is clear,—(1.) How in this the way of the Lord is <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> who is under <hi>no debt,</hi> no obligation to the ſons of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. but is abſolutely <hi>free,</hi> to let forth grace to, or withhold it from, whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. His bleſſed will being the alone rule of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, he comprehends the reaſon of all his counſels and judgments, which are to us incomprehenſible: yet do's he ſo far condeſcend, to let men ſee, his unſpotted Juſtice, as well as his Sovereignty, in this ſhines forth, <hi>that they who are unjuſt</hi> by a deliberate choice, ſhould <hi>be unjuſt ſtill</hi> by a further arreſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. and thoſe <hi>who will not hearken</hi> and <hi>will have none of him,</hi> ſhould be delivered up to <hi>the luſts of their own heart.

Do's not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhew the marvellous conveyance of this judgment <hi>Is.</hi> 6. 6. how this ſad ſentence is more immediately paſſed on the ſoul; yea, by thoſe moſt ſingular means, the <hi>word</hi>&amp;<hi>ordinances</hi> for enlivening, is it executed thereon; men <hi>preached</hi> deaf and dead, where others find life; this is a ſtroke, that does not draw a bar betwixt them and external fellowſhip with the ordinances, but O it draws an inviſible bar betwixt them and the power and efficacy thereof. It is a judgment that walks in the dark, and binds where none can looſe; it killeth without a cry; yea gives men a death-ſtroke when the pain of that wound is not felt. (3.) Do you not ſee how this ſtrange judgment is in as great a height and meaſure held forth by the Scripture, as you ſee it in any example before your eyes, that <hi>men</hi> will be mad in their <hi>oppoſition to God,</hi> even when <hi>he</hi> is moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably <hi>oppoſing them?</hi> ſuch as <hi>Ahaz</hi> who did <hi>treſpaſs the more,</hi> the more he was <hi>diſtreſſed,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 22. Yea, ſuch who with theſe men of <hi>Sodom</hi> would <hi>grope after the door,</hi> &amp; perſiſt in that wickedneſs when God hath immediately <hi>ſmitten them with blindneſs</hi> for the ſame. O what may be the next ſtroke, where men renew their aſſault againſt God, after he hath once and againſt ſmitten them; who, in ſtead of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his ſore plagues, turn enraged to <hi>blaſpheme</hi> him, who hath power over the ſame!

Yea, it may be ſeen in all ages, that ſuch a length this judgment will come, to look on the moſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing extraordinary judgments of God on <hi>others,</hi> and yet not be moved therewith themſelves; that <hi>when his hand is lifted up, they will not ſee:</hi> but the poſterity take up the ſame quarrel, &amp; purſue it wherein
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:005185_0239_1016DB9005869CA0"/>
they have ſeen their fathers fall, under the ſtroke of an avenging God.—(4.) We may alſo know from the Scripture, how deep this judgment may draw in its <hi>dreadful effects:</hi> what a judical arreſt is thus ſerved on men, by which they are bound over to <hi>deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>their bands made ſtrong</hi> on them, as that they can neither ſtir nor move, but as malefactors ſhut up in jail, and under fetters; which is not more evident before the execution, than this arreſt on their ſoul is by obduration before ſome further ſtroke. Thus they ly near <hi>ſudden deſtruction,</hi> and a blow that is irrecoverable, who have <hi>harden'd themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der frequent reproofs. (Prov.</hi> 29.) It is known, what <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> laſt rebuke was, after he had rejected many; it ſtands upon publick record to after-ages. I ſhall add, is there not ſomething of <hi>hell</hi> here, and of thoſe everlaſting fetters, in ſome meaſure made viſible in the earth? For where light and conviction do reſolve into rage and malice againſt the truth, nothing can be more like hell, or have a more near reſemblance to the devil.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I ſhall add one inſtance more, which may ſeem alſo ſtrange, and a marvellous piece of the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, <hi>that the righteous ſhould fall,</hi> and <hi>have one event with the wicked</hi> in a time of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whilſt we ſee ſome <hi>notorious for wickedneſs,</hi> and their horrid actings in oppoſition to the Church, <hi>go to the grave in peace,</hi> as to any remarkable ſtroke from the Lord upon them. I know, men are ready to wonder hereat; yea, thence an Atheiſt will infer, things muſt fall out at an adventure: But O if theſe would bring this to the Scripture, and ſet it in the light of the word! they ſhould there ſee how convincingly it is verified, and that there is nothing here which do's not clearly agree with that bleſſed record. For it ſhews, (1.) That by no <hi>external</hi> providences, or any thing diſpenſed within time, yea, by no affliction obvious to ſenſe, the way of the Lord and his reſpects
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:005185_0240_1016DBDFC5C2D2B0"/>
                     <hi>to his people</hi> can be judged, even amidſt the great variety of events, which here fall out: But we are in this obliged to adore God, whoſe judgments are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, when we ſee at the ſame time <hi>a juſt man periſh in his righteouſneſs, and a wicked man prolong his life in wickedneſs. Eccl.</hi> 7. 25.—(2.) The Scripture gives us this return alſo about ſuch a providence, <hi>why the ſword devours both,</hi> and as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> fall together, that there the Lord does in a <hi>ſpecial</hi> way <hi>difference</hi> betwixt one and another. <hi>Joſias</hi> died in <hi>peace,</hi> as was promiſed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 20. yet he <hi>fell upon the high places of the field,</hi> in the common judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But he was then <hi>taken from the evil to come;</hi> yea, thus was delivered, even by a ſtroke of the hot diſpleaſure of God, on <hi>others.</hi> It is not ſtrange, that ſome may be hid in the grave from a <hi>further</hi> ſtorm, by the ſame judgment wherein the Lord is purſuing the land, in which they have their abode.-(3.) It is clear from the Scripure, how <hi>ſmall an acceſſion</hi> to a ſinful courſe may in the holy diſpleaſure of God bring ſome of his people under the ſame ſtroke with his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and ſo far involve them in that judgment. We find <hi>Ps.</hi> 1. 1. there is a <hi>ſtanding in the way,</hi> and <hi>joining in the counſel of the ungodly,</hi> held forth as a <hi>partaking with them in their ſin:</hi> and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. tells us, that <hi>not mourning for,</hi> and witneſſing a diſſent againſt the national <hi>ſins</hi> of the time, puts men far out of that bleſſed <hi>roll</hi> of thoſe whom the Lord does difference from others by a <hi>mark</hi> of his preſervation.—Now as to that other, how it is the <hi>wicked prolong their days</hi> in wickedneſs, and may go in ſome exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal peace to the grave, do but enquire at the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and it will ſhew, (1.)

               <p>FOr the Scriptures accompliſhment is this; that which not only the Chriſtian's experience, and obſervation of the Church, bear witneſs to, but is alſo <hi>a truth which even to the view and conviction of the World, may be demonſtrated from whom it doth oft force a teſtimony, yea, in every age the worſt of men have been forced to acknowledge;</hi> it muſt be a thing every evident.

               </p>
               <p>It is true, thoſe ſweet and ſenſible enjoyments, which the Saints have of this truth, the World cannot reach; but it is alſo ſure, that in every age, the works of the Lord, and ſome more remarkable convincing providences, both of judgment and mercy, do ſolemnly invite men to obſerve the accompliſhment of the word therein; yea, no time hath wanted ſomething
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:005185_0242_1016DBE154940160"/>
of a publick witneſs from <hi>ungodly</hi> men, even greateſt <hi>mockers</hi> of Religion, who under that conſtraining power of conſcience at death, or in ſome day of their ſtrait, have been forced to ſeal the truth, by a very open confeſſion of the righteouſneſs of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. And this is indeed the Lord's bleſſed deſign, in making his works ſometime ſo conſpicuous, that they may not only confirm the faith of his people, but render <hi>Atheiſm</hi> inexcuſable; that the glory of his faithfulneſs, as well as of his power, and wiſdom, may ſhine forth before the ſons of men. I confeſs, we may wonder why the <hi>World</hi> looketh ſo little upon this; and how the conviction of ſo great a truth, which they cannot ſhun, doth not more preſs them: but the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> doth fully reſolve this, <hi>The brutiſh man knoweth not, neither do fools lay to heart,</hi> how the Scripture taketh place, <hi>that flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wicked men is but in judgment</hi> for their further ruin.</p>
               <p>To proſecute this argument a little, there are ſome <hi>ſpecial truths</hi> I would inſtance, wherein the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in fulfilling his word may be ſeen by the <hi>World;</hi> yea, is obvious to the moſt ordinary obſervers. And though they be but a few, which I ſhall here touch, yet I may ſay, they are ſuch concerning truths, and have ſo near a reference to the foundation of our faith, that men cannot acknowledge the ſame, but muſt alſo confeſs the Scripture's Divinity, and that there is a truth and reality in godlineſs and in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion. I may truly here with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence challenge the greateſt <hi>Atheiſts</hi> yea, appeal to their conſcience and ſerious thoughts, if in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing inſtances (though but a little of what might be ſaid on ſuch a ſubject) the truth and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Scripture be not very manifeſt.</p>

                  <hi>FIRST. I</hi> ſhall firſt hold forth this truth, that <hi>man is ſurely fallen from that excellent eſtate wherein once he was formed, (Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19.) <hi>and now is not that which he was at the beginning.</hi> A truth ſo clear that we may ſay, even without the diſcovery of the word, might be eaſy for any ſerious obſerver to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſame; yea, had not even <hi>heathens</hi> ſome glance at this? The evidence whereof they could not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſhun.</p>
               <p>It is true, the cauſe &amp; original of this dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion; how <hi>ſin entered into the World;</hi> how it is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived</hi> to the whole race of man, by imputation, as well as inheſion; how that poiſon is carried from the fountain to the ciſtern; this the Scripture doth only diſcover: but this, I am ſure, may be obvious to all, that poor man is thus ſick &amp; diſeaſed, &amp; now beareth the marks of ſuch a fall and ruin, as we read of in the word.

                  </gap> ſerious enquiry, <hi>whence</hi> ſuch a thing is, or whether there can be a <hi>recovery</hi> of ſo ſad &amp; deſperate like caſe. But to clear this a little, I would offer theſe three things to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is ſome <hi>remainder of that excellent fabrick,</hi> which may yet appear among its ruins! ſome print and appearance (though dark) of that <hi>primitive</hi> luſtre and beauty; ſome draughts, which ſin hath not wholly worn out; that may clearly tell what man <hi>once</hi> was, and point out his former excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that he hath been an other creature, of whom <hi>Abſalom'</hi>s character might be truly ſaid, <hi>without all blemiſh from the head to the foot.</hi> For we ſee the deep impreſſions of a <hi>Deity</hi> ſtill rooted in men, even among the moſt wild and ſavage, which no inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can utterly raze; we ſee ſome common princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>reaſon,</hi> that are imprinted in the moſt rude and

ignorant; ſome innate notions and Ideas, which the ſoul hath of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> among all, and in every place of the earth; likewiſe thoſe <hi>natural truths</hi> KOINAI ENNOIAI, which we may ſee are no ways impreſt on the ſoul from any objects of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> but ſuch whereto men by an unavoidable neceſſity are forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſſent: and beſides, what meaneth the witneſs of the conſcience, and authority thereof in every man, which they cannot poſſibly decline? O do not theſe witneſs, that from ſome great height poor man hath fallen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Doth not the <hi>preſent appearance of man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> clearly ſhew, that he is fallen into ſome dreadful <hi>diſeaſe;</hi> that it is ſurely overſpread with ſome horrid leproſy and contagion, the ſymptoms whereof now are moſt diſcernable? O what an exorbitancy doth appear in his deſires? with what contrary tides is he hurried? ſtill at jar with his preſent lot! his reaſon and will, once in a ſweet league, are now at war, betwixt which he is oft rent in pieces, as one betwixt wild horſes. How is he now reſtleſs in an unreaſonable purſuit? he laboureth in the fire, and for a ſhadow: yea, what do theſe tumults and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of the earth mean? men upon the ſmalleſt account ſheathing their ſwords in others bowels, <hi>homo homini lupus;</hi> ruptures in families; unſatiable in revenge, and the earth ſo oft in an uproar as a rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſea. O do not theſe too viſibly witneſs, what a dreadful diſorder and perturbation there muſt be within, impetuous boyling of man's luſts! ſo that here we may ſee a very manifeſt rupture and breach of a building, once well knit and framed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would aſk, wherein <hi>man's</hi> true <hi>advantage</hi> and <hi>excellency,</hi> above others of the creatures, can be ſeen, if not with ſome reſpect to what he <hi>once</hi> was, and that bleſſed <hi>reſtoration</hi> by grace: For his <hi>Knowledge</hi> doth oft ſerve but to <hi>increaſe his ſorrow;</hi> to ſhew

the <hi>good</hi> he wanteth, and the <hi>evil</hi> he is ſubject to.

Or are theſe ſo <hi>unruly?</hi> do they ſo much go out of their bounds and ſtation? which the many laws made for man in the world, with the convincing neceſſity thereof, can witneſs. We ſee alſo that <hi>ſore travel</hi> is appointed to man; at how much toil he is for an outward ſubſiſtance; how he doth oft ſow and not reap; the beaſts withdraw from the yoke; thoſe over whom he had dominion, ready to aſſault him; how women bring forth their children in ſorrow; the men are attended with fear, their life oft made bitter with care and labour; yea, as men increaſe in the world, their care &amp; diſcontent increaſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with! But beſides all, is he not in the greateſt <hi>ſlavery,</hi> of all the creatures, through the violence of his <hi>luſts?</hi> that make him purſue the bait, though he knoweth it will undo him; while his corruption doth oft like a ſtrong man bind him in fetters, and his fleſh impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly drag him at its heels! O may we not ſay, was poor man thus framed at the beginning? or raiſed ſo far above the reſt of the creatures, only to make him the more miſerable! For truly if a lively portraicture could be drawn of ſinful depraved <hi>nature,</hi> there is none ſo groſs but ſhould abhor, yea, be affrighted, to ſee that in the third perſon, with which (alas) they are ſo friendly to in themſelves.</p>

                  <hi>SECOND. That ſo great a change is truly wrought upon men in Converſion,</hi> (as the Scripture doth promiſe and hold forth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3, 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1, 5. <hi>Coloſs.</hi> 3. 1, 2.) wherein ſomething <hi>above nature,</hi> even the marvellous <hi>power of the grace of God,</hi> may be ſeen; is a truth I am ſure, known, and undeniable to the <hi>world:</hi> yea, the greateſt <hi>mockers</hi> at religion
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:005185_0246_1016DBE649F51668"/>
muſt confeſs, can be no deluſion, but is indeed real and certain; upon theſe following grounds.</p>
               <p>(1.) That the moſt <hi>groſs,</hi> who in their practice have been openly profane, in the place wherein they lived, it hath been ſeen how <hi>grace</hi> hath reached <hi>them:</hi> and thus the <hi>Leopard</hi> hath been made to <hi>change his ſpots,</hi> and ſuch who were <hi>accuſtomed to do evil, have learned to do well.</hi> O! Do not many famous inſtances witneſs this, in every age?—(2.) That alſo men moſt <hi>principled</hi> in their judgment <hi>againſt</hi> the way of God, who were wont to deride holineſs as a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, even on <hi>ſuch,</hi> ſo great a change hath been wrought as hath made the world to wonder: but then they were forced to lay down their prejudice, yea, to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at themſelves, how they could ſtand before the truth ſo long, whereof they have got ſuch an impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Sure, Atheiſts muſt grant there have been as profeſt Atheiſts as themſelves, who have been made eminent examples of grace.—(3.) That ſuch even in the <hi>height</hi> of their wickedneſs (like <hi>Saul</hi> breathing out cruelty, and of late <hi>Vergerius</hi> while he was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the truth) <hi>grace</hi> hath ſometimes reached them. It hath been found, that of Chriſt's greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſome have thus <hi>fallen, upon their high places,</hi> before the power of the word; ſome ſuch trophies of the goſpel's conqueſt have been conſpicuous in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age: yea, it is oft ſeen that ſome remarkable height in ſin hath proved an evident <hi>Criſis,</hi> and turn in men's condition, either to judgment, or mercy.—(4.) That ſome of the moſt <hi>eminent adverſaries of the truth</hi> have, through grace, been made <hi>eminently uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtruments in the Church,</hi> the world cannot deny; that there have not been choiſer veſſels of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, more zealous for the Lord in their time, than ſuch, who were once moſt violent in their oppoſition.—(5.) That ſuch whom the world did reckon moſt <hi>wiſe</hi> and diſcerning, yea, that did want no judgment to
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:005185_0247_1016DB9D2F76A668"/>
know the value of <hi>outward</hi> things, as well as others, <hi>grace</hi> hath reached. Can the Atheiſts object, <hi>Do any of the rulers, or Rabbies believe in Chriſt,</hi> or follow that way! when it is ſo clear, that not more wiſe, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and judicious (even themſelves being judges) have been in their time, then ſome who are moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the matter of Religion.—(6.) Hath not this change been made diſcernable upon the <hi>ſimple,</hi> the moſt ſtupid, and dull, yea, upon ſome ſuch as their natural incapacity might have obſtructed the work, if ſomething <hi>above nature</hi> had not carried it on! which may be alſo manifeſt by ſome change even on their <hi>underſtanding,</hi> to ſhew that this can make wiſe the <hi>ſimple,</hi> and <hi>in the way of holineſs, the way-far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, though a fool, ſhall not err.</hi>—(7.) That by a very <hi>improbable</hi> mean, the word, and that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by <hi>weakeſt</hi> inſtruments, we ſee this great change hath been wrought: and it is remarkable, how little of the work of converſion did follow the putting forth of <hi>miracles</hi> in the primitive times, but by the <hi>ſimplicity of the preached goſpel</hi> much more. For indeed the converſion of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oul, and ſuch a change is it ſelf ſome way a miracle.—(8.) That they are not a <hi>few,</hi> on whom this change hath been wrought, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable: and truly, beſides theſe ordinary proofs, I think, it is a great defect there ſhould not be ſome more ſpecial <hi>record</hi> by the Church, of theſe illuſtrious and eminent inſtances of the grace of God, which have been in ſuch an age, as well as remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of judgment. (9.) Men muſt ſee this fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not out <hi>at an adventure,</hi> which is wrought upon <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>not another,</hi> whilſt both are alike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning; yea, ſome who ſeem furtheſt from the grace of God, very groſs and rude, have been taken, when the more civil and refined, and of a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing natural diſpoſition, have been paſt by. O doth not this witneſs the grace of God, and ſovereignty
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:005185_0248_1016DBEBB0A1C888"/>
thereof! (10.) Is not this change oft diſcernable upon men in a <hi>time while no advantage from without doth</hi> appear? even times of preſecution and hazard, from which many have dated their firſt acquaintance with God; when they could expect nothing but a ſuffering lot. Sure there muſt be ſomething above nature in it. (11.) It is alſo known how <hi>great a cloud of witneſſes</hi> have ſealed this truth. O! can there be ſuch an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal enchantment, that in every age, in ſeveral, yea, in moſt remote places of the earth, hath fallen upon ſo many, who have witneſſed the power of the Goſpel? or can all theſe be void of underſtanding? What gain or outward advantage could they deſign in that which is ſo uſually attended with outward hazard and loſs! or what credit from men, while it maketh them the very butt of the world's hatred and reproach? Yea, can it be thought that all theſe could have combined to conſpire into ſo great a cheat? I muſt appeal Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts to their ſerious thoughts of this matter.—(12.) The marvellous <hi>effect</hi> of this change, doth it not witneſs that this is no fancy or deluſion; when men are reached with ſuch a ſtroke, and by one word, as hath made the ſtout-hearted and moſt daring to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to ſhew by their very countenance, that there is another tribunal than man's, before which they are arraigned? Muſt it not be ſad earneſt, and a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous power, that can make ſo willing a divorce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt men, and their <hi>idols,</hi> which were once as their right eye to them; and beat them off that ground of <hi>ſelf-righteouſneſs,</hi> which they had been ſo long eſtabliſhing to themſelves; that ſhould cauſe them alſo <hi>chuſe</hi> the <hi>reproach of Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>croſs,</hi> before any outward advantage, and abandon that ſociety, without which ſometimes they could not live? Muſt not this ſpeak forth ſomething above natural reaſon! O! may not the world oft wonder what is become of their old friends! though I confeſs, this ſhould
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:005185_0249_1016DBED44393CE0"/>
rather put them, with wonder and aſtoniſhment, to ſome ſerious inquiry whence ſo great a change can be!</p>
               <p>(¶) It is ſtrange, the World, does not more wonder at <hi>Converſion,</hi> which is ſo great a <hi>miracle,</hi> yea it may be ſaid, one of the <hi>greateſt</hi> hath been in the earth; ſince it is no leſs marvellous, than to raiſe out of the grave ſuch who are truly dead. O how convincingly demonſtrative is this, of the truth and reality of grace; yea, even to the view of the World, do's witneſs an irreſiſtible efficacious power with the <hi>word,</hi> that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth the ſoul, enlightens the eye, and maketh wiſe the ſimple, Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. Should we not with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment look on a Chriſtian, if we did ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a change the <hi>grace</hi> of God makes here, from that he <hi>once</hi> was, and how great a change <hi>glory</hi> will ere long make from that he <hi>now is!</hi> I know, there are many things we wonder at from our <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> But oh! it is men's ignorance and eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from this, makes it ſo <hi>little</hi> their wonder. For, if we be aſſuredly perſwaded of the truth of <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> which the World cannot deny without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction both to ſenſe and reaſon, we have then three great truths unanſwerably demonſtrated. 1. That the <hi>Scripture</hi> of God is faithful and true, which holds this forth. 2. That there is a divine <hi>Spirit,</hi> and a power above nature, that do's certainly accompany the ſame. 3. It is then clear, there are two <hi>contrary ſtates</hi> in another World, ſince they are here ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. Now, beſides theſe evidences already mentioned, I would here offer ſome further upon ſo grave, and weighty a ſubject, to ſhew how very clear and convincing the demonſtration of this truth is, that the World cannot but ſee the very <hi>immediate power of God,</hi> and ſomething above nature in <hi>Converſion,</hi> if they do not ſhut their eyes thereat. Conſider but theſe,—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:005185_0250_1016DC37F014BF10"/>
(1.)Is it not a ſtrange and marvellous thing, that could change one <hi>ſpecies</hi> of a creature into <hi>another,</hi> turn a wolf or tyger into a lamb, ſure this would be aſtoniſhing; yet ſuch a change is here, which makes ſo vaſt a difference betwixt one and himſelf, takes him off his former delights and exerciſes, his old friends and ſociety, with whom he once thought the time ſhort, yea, makes the man who was a perſecutor of the truth, and took Pleaſure therein, now rejoice to ſuffer perſecution on that ſame account! I think, the World will not debate, where ſo many known inſtances are at all times obvious. (2.) Is it not marvellous, which can <hi>eſtrange</hi> men from their worldly <hi>intereſts,</hi> and take their heart off that which was as their <hi>right eye,</hi> and ſubdue under them that which once took them captive at its pleaſure? O does it not ſhew, they have got their eyes opened to ſee things, which were formerly hid! Yea, how ſtrange is it that thoſe whoſe praedominant Sin was love to the <hi>World,</hi> and have been in their natural diſpoſition moſt narrow and griping, that they could not allow themſelves the comfortable uſe of that they had, even theſe this change hath ſo powerfully reached, as to cauſe a willing ſurrender and quitting of all for Chriſt! I could offer known inſtances of this; and thoſe at as great an advantage then, in the exerciſe of their judgment and reaſon, as ever, whom the World might ſee were moſt ſerious and compoſed therein. (3.) Would you debate the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacious <hi>power</hi> of that which ſhould melt and diſſolve the hardeſt <hi>ſtone?</hi> and may you not wonder what a power this muſt be, which will make men <hi>melt</hi> and diſſolve in tears, and ſtand <hi>trembling before the word,</hi> who through their life were known to be moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate and ſtupid? Yea, is not this great change ſometimes with ſuch <hi>terror</hi> and <hi>downcaſting</hi> uſhered in, that may convince obſervers, it is a matter of greateſt <hi>earneſt,</hi> and no counterfeit? and ſurely
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:005185_0251_1016DBF0375B0D10"/>
theſe muſt be reached by ſome power, before which there is no ſtanding.—(4.) How great a thing is that which takes men <hi>unawares,</hi> beyond their thoughts and intention? <hi>Mathew,</hi> and thoſe other diſciples, did not know in the morning what ſhould befal them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night: it was indeed a happy day, when on their return they had that account to give, <hi>We have found the Meſſias!</hi> and it is ſure, many ſince have been thus ſurpriſed; yea, in <hi>one hour</hi> have got ſuch a ſight, which will never go from their heart; they now ſee what report could never have made them believed; they now know what it is to be taken out of a dreadful gulf of darkneſs into a <hi>marvellous light!</hi> And truly there is this uſually diſcernable in it, how ſome <hi>one word</hi> will force its paſſage, and take fire within, as a word beyond all others <hi>fitly ſpoken,</hi> and fitted by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine appointment to <hi>open the heart.</hi>—(5.) It is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous change, which do's even reach <hi>young</hi> ones, and theſe ſometimes of an age little above <hi>infancy.</hi> For it is certainly known, how ſuch whoſe <hi>years</hi> might ſhew there was no deſign to cheat the world, yea, ſometimes in a family where little advantage for their <hi>education</hi> hath appeared, have given evidence of this wonderfully, above themſelves and their age; yea, at <hi>death</hi> have witneſſed ſome power of the grace of God, and his Spirit on their ſoul, their <hi>hope</hi> and the <hi>grounds</hi> of it, with ſuch <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs,</hi> as hath forced on by-ſtanders this diſcovery of an <hi>immediate teaching of the Spirit,</hi> and of a <hi>mighty power of God,</hi> that can witneſs in theſe, ere they can well ſpeak or exerciſe reaſon, the power of Religion. O whence ſhould this be! and truly for the truth thereof I could offer known <hi>inſtances,</hi> if it ſhould be brought on debate.—(6.) What a change is it that do's alſo reach men in their <hi>old age,</hi> who have been long rooted &amp; inured to the world, who have ſat out many a call, in their reſiſting the Goſpel; yet is it not
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:005185_0252_1016DC3B6C3B0F20"/>
ſeen, how theſe in their <hi>gray hairs</hi> have been made to weep and confeſs, after ſixty or ſeventy years li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under the Goſpel, that then only they <hi>begun</hi> to know what it is to be <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> I confeſs, this is one of the <hi>rare</hi> trophies of the grace of God; yet no age wants ſome ſuch inſtances, to prove, how far <hi>grace</hi> can prevail over <hi>nature, cuſtom, education,</hi> and all thoſe <hi>diſadvantages,</hi> which uſe to attend the time of old age.—(7.) What a ſtrange power is it, which hath been ſo evidently witneſſed on ſome <hi>horridly fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious,</hi> who have outrun others in all manner of wickedneſs; yea, even then whilſt <hi>juſtice</hi> was crying for puniſhment to cut them off, <hi>grace</hi> hath ſtept in to ſave, and reached them at a ſcaffold or gibbet! It is ſure, the world cannot queſtion this truth: and O ſhould it not be convincing, to ſee <hi>two</hi> brought to a publick <hi>death</hi> for ſome groſs crime, who have the <hi>ſame hazard</hi> before them, and the <hi>ſame means</hi> made uſe of for their conviction; yet the <hi>one</hi> melting in contrition, &amp; the <hi>other</hi> moſt hardned! You cannot ſay, that this is from a different nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſince ſometimes thoſe of a more promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing nature, and better diſpoſition, have been ſeen fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, than ſuch of whom leaſt was expected.—(8.) Is it not a ſtrange change, which even on thoſe where <hi>no ordinary means</hi> could be ſubſervient, can be witneſſed? where no company, no example, no uſual way for inſtruction, can be alledged; ſo that it may be ſeen, they have been truly <hi>taught of the Lord;</hi> that there is ſuch a thing as his immediate tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; that in a very extraordinary way, by means moſt improbable, he can convey himſelf into the ſoul. In a word, this can be no reſult of one's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural complexion; for then it would appear in, and accompany, their <hi>younger</hi> years in ſome meaſure, and <hi>grow up</hi> with them. This change alſo, in thoſe of moſt <hi>different natures,</hi> moſt unlike and croſs to others hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:005185_0253_1016DBF1DE98B7C8"/>
and diſpoſition, is made diſcernable. Yea, muſt it not be ſomething above <hi>moral ſwaſion,</hi> or any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſives of humane eloquence, ſince here <hi>the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of preaching</hi> is found more effectual, than any ſuch way? Yea, it is ſeen how the moſt ſublime and poliſh'd ſtrains of <hi>oratory,</hi> and greateſt gifts, have oft come ſhort of that <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> which hath followed more improbable means. I ſhall add, O is not this ſomething above nature, which makes men partake of the <hi>divine nature,</hi> and do's ſo viſibly impreſs the <hi>image of God</hi> on them!</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſhut this up with three remarkable <hi>Inſtances</hi> of the power and efficacy of grace in <hi>Converſion;</hi> of which in every age there may be a large record. Firſt, that excellent man JUNIUS; whoſe life we have in ſome meaſure ſet down by himſelf, with many notable remarks of providence, and therein ſhewing the Lord's ingaging him at firſt; how being very looſe, and carried away with evil company, yea, tempted to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> he was one day moved to go and read the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and at the firſt opening, accoſted with that of the firſt of <hi>John;</hi> which whilſt he read (as he ſays) did ſuddenly <hi>aſtoniſh</hi> him, and leave a marvellous <hi>conviction</hi> on his ſoul, of the divinity of the ſubject, the Majeſty and Authority of the writing; ſo that all day he knew not where, and what he was: but thus turns himſelf with theſe words to the Lord, <hi>Thou waſt mindful of me, O my God, according to the multitude of thy tender mercies!</hi> Yea, gives this account, that he then had a <hi>ſight of the Scripture,</hi> which made him ſee it did exceed all humane elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and this was followed with ſuch <hi>power,</hi> that his body <hi>trembled,</hi> and his mind became <hi>aſtoniſhed,</hi> with ſuch a ſurpriſing and <hi>marvellous light:</hi> and from that day he begun to be ſerious in the way of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="unknown:005185_0254_1016DC3FE966E468"/>
A ſecond inſtance I ſhall offer is, the remarkable <hi>Converſion</hi> of worthy Maſter BOLTON, a choice Miniſter in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> in whoſe life this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that being eminently prophane, a horrid ſwearer, and much accuſtomed to mock at holineſs, and theſe who moſt ſhined therein, and particularly that excellent Man of God Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> then Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whom he much undervalued for his plainneſs in preaching the truths of God; yea, was near the length of <hi>Popery:</hi> but on the Lord's gracious appearance to him, was put to have other thoughts, with a very remarkable change upon him, though with that <hi>terrour,</hi> that (as he ſaid himſelf) the Lord ſeemed to <hi>run upon him, like a giant,</hi> throwing him to the ground, and with ſuch a terrifying diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>ſin,</hi> as cauſed him to <hi>roar in anguiſh,</hi> and oft riſe in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight on that account, which continued for diverſe <hi>months;</hi> Yea, theſe aſſaults in the pangs of the new birth were ſuch, that it might have been ſaid, <hi>Ut nec color, nec ſenſus, nec ſanguis ſupereſſet.</hi> But at laſt a bleſſed ſun-ſhine brake out, and he after to his old age proved a burning and ſhining light.—Now beſides theſe two great men, I think it not unſutable, (ſince it is to commend the grace of God and witneſs the reality thereof, who of all kind of ſinners, as well as of all kindreds and nations, hath brought ſome to glory) that I ſet down one very ſtrange inſtance in this country, of a poor <hi>Buggerer,</hi> who not many years ago was put to death in the town of <hi>Air,</hi> for that horrid wickedneſs. He had been a moſt ſtupid &amp; <hi>brutiſh perſon;</hi> ſuch an one who looked, to all who knew him, as if he had been above the reach of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means: but in the <hi>priſon,</hi> the Lord did mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly witneſs the power of his grace, and in ſuch a meaſure diſcovered to him his ſinfulneſs, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much ſerious exerciſe upon his ſoul, and fore wreſtling, a moſt kindly word of <hi>repentance</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:005185_0255_1016DBF4EE5E77D8"/>
with great <hi>aſſurance;</hi> ſo that when he came to the ſtake, he could not ceaſe from <hi>crying out</hi> to the people, under the ſenſe of pardon, and that comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſunſhine of the preſence of God; <hi>O he is a great forgiver! He is a great forgiver!</hi> and had therewith theſe words; <hi>Now hath perfect love caſt out all fear: I know, God hath nothing to lay againſt me, for Jeſus Chriſt hath paid all,</hi> and <hi>thoſe are free whom the ſon makes free!</hi> Thus, in a tranſport of wonder and joy, did he die; the marvellous grace of God raiſing him then above other men, who not long before ſeemed, in ſome reſpect, below a beaſt. (¶)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THIRD. That the communion and fellowſhip with God,</hi> whereto the Saints are in this life admitted, and brought near to him in the ſpirit, <hi>is a moſt real thing,</hi> and no deluſion; is a truth which may be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly demonſtrated, even to the view of the <hi>World,</hi> and to ſuch who are but Spectators of the ſame. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. I know, this is a truth that muſt be <hi>ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> and therefore the world cannot <hi>know it,</hi> or reach that <hi>unſpeakable joy</hi> and delight, which is found by the Saints in that ſweet path: yet I muſt ſay, there are ſome things, and ſome ſuch convincing evidences, as may witneſs to men, and rationally demonſtrate the ſame; the conviction whereof they cannot poſſibly ſhun, if they but come near, and in their ſerious thoughts conſider,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. How <hi>great</hi> and <hi>excellent a company</hi> do bear this teſtimony, even as many as in every time did ever <hi>ſerve God in the Spirit.</hi> Is not this tranſmitted by the father to the children, as their experience? And as certainly tried by ſucceeding ages; a truth which is not once, or twice proved in the Chriſtian's life! For the proofs thereof are innumerable, and paſt recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:005185_0256_1016DC4174B6EF20"/>
which they have had; yea, amongſt all the Saints ſince the days of <hi>Abel,</hi> to this preſent time, there was never one contradictory witneſs could be produced.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are not thoſe, who do thus teſtify what they have oft found in ſecret retirements to God, <hi>ſuch whoſe teſtimony,</hi> in any other matter, <hi>the worſt of men could not refuſe,</hi> or deny to be famous? I am ſure, the <hi>World</hi> is convinced, that the followers of Chriſt dare not, yea, uſe not to deal falſly in other things with thoſe they have to do with, however their malice carry them to reproach them; yea, that they are more to be credited, than ſuch, who make a ſcorn of Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have they not had as great <hi>intereſt,</hi> and ſhare of the World as others, and been of as <hi>diſcerning</hi> ſpirits to know the true value of things, who from their experience do not only declare, there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted reality in converſe with God; but that the joy and delight herein, which they have found, is above all the pleaſures of the fleſh? O! what muſt that be, which could make ſuch, who wanted no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word allurements, who had not loſt their taſte, and were fleſh and blood as well as others, to turn their back on all for Chriſt, and by their walk teſtify they have found ſome more ſatisfying enjoyment in fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Muſt not this be very obvious, and convincing, that when men <hi>once become ſerious</hi> in the way of God, they have got ſome <hi>new acquaintance?</hi> that ſure there is another world, and ſome other ſociety, than that of men, with which they have intercourſe. Whence are theſe frequent retirements, from which they have been ſeen ſo oft to come forth with greateſt ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with ſome remarkable change in their caſe? Doth it not thus appear, <hi>They are not alone, when they are alone;</hi> yea, in ſuch a ſolitude muſt find ſomething very deſireable?</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="222" facs="unknown:005185_0257_1016DBFA6D88A1A8"/>
5. Is not this alſo teſtifyed, in <hi>times</hi> when men could not well <hi>diſſemble,</hi> or be ſuſpected of deceit? in times of great outward affliction; when the World alſo hath been moſt tempting them with its offers; yea at death, when they are ſtepping over that threſhold; a time, wherein the words of dying men are of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt weight and credit, the ſpirits of ſuch being then more unbyaſſed, and free of thoſe ordinary temptations wherewith others are ſwayed! How oft have they at <hi>ſuch times</hi> declared, that ſurely God is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with men, which they have found, and though they were going to change their place, yet were not to change their company!</p>
               <p n="6">6. Can that be a deluſion, which is ſo <hi>ſenſible</hi> at the time preſent? When the Saints are not more ſure that they live, than they are ſure of this truth, what near approaches and refreſhing views they have got while <hi>God hath come near to their ſoul,</hi> what a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable elevation of their ſpirits doth go along with this? Yea, on the other hand, as the <hi>withdrawing</hi> hereof is very ſenſible to themſelves, is there not ſomething of this even obvious to thoſe about them, how great a change and difference this will make in their caſe, from other times, which they cannot get hid?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Doth not ſomething of this truth appear on the very <hi>countenance</hi> and <hi>outward carriage</hi> of Chriſtians? what a luſtre, and reſemblance of <hi>Heaven,</hi> a holy <hi>ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi> and <hi>compoſure</hi> of ſpirit, when they have been brought near God, in ſecret converſe with him, and taken up to the mountain! In a word, doth not the walk of a ſerious mortified Chriſtian convincingly witneſs this? yea, it cannot but be ſome way aſtoniſhing to the <hi>World,</hi> what ſhould make them look ſo well, and with ſuch ſatisfaction, when no viſible cauſe for it, when ſhut up in priſon from converſe with friends, and acquaintance? Sure, men will not think a rational
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:005185_0258_1016DC4508AF57C8"/>
ſpirit ſo demented as to quit their former pleaſures, and chuſe the croſs, that they may only deceive the World with a counterfeit joy and ſatisfaction, if they did not really find the ſame. And while it is too too evident, what a dreadful ſociety and commerce many have with the <hi>Devil,</hi> ſhould any queſtion or debate; whether the Saints have truly communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>God,</hi> the Father of Spirits, whom they ſerve and worſhip.</p>
               <p>

I confeſs, the Saints are much under a dark cloud here, thro' the prevalence of corruption; yea, are oft accounted as <hi>the filth of the world:</hi> but when grace in any greater meaſure, and in vigorous exerciſe, doth ſhew it ſelf, then there appeareth ſo much as will darken all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

They cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſhun ſuch a conviction,—1. What an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>difference</hi> is betwixt their way, who <hi>walk with God,</hi> and that of the moſt poliſhed <hi>moraliſt.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is in the one, which doth witneſs a more <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit,</hi> a higher elevation, a ſweet harmony, and equability in their way, that they move in ſome higher ſphere, act from other principles, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome greater intereſt than any thing here, have more of a large heart to ſerve their generation, than theſe whoſe ſelf intereſt is ſeen to be the firſt and laſt in all their motions.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="224" facs="unknown:005185_0259_1016DBFD6DAD2D20"/>
2. May it not alſo appear to obſervers that tender ſerious Chriſtians who live <hi>near</hi> God, do truly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their <hi>reſemblance</hi> and <hi>likeneſs</hi> to him; to whom they move, as to their great and laſt end? yea, do evidence a more true excellency of ſpirit, what a ſweet calm and ſerenity they have within, while going through things that are moſt croſs and vexing; with what diſcernable quietneſs theſe can look upon moſt affrighting revolutions in the world, as ſuch whoſe treaſure and great intereſt is beyond hazard, though the earth were all turned to aſhes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is there not ſo much in the way and carriage of the <hi>ſaints,</hi> yea, ſuch a <hi>majeſty</hi> and <hi>authority,</hi> that attendeth <hi>holineſs,</hi> and doth force <hi>reſpect</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> even from thoſe who moſt <hi>hate</hi> them; yea, and doth force men to juſtify ſuch in their conſcience, whom they openly reproach, and perſecute; Whence it is, that a ſerious tender Chriſtian is oft a ſcare crow and terror to the prophane, when there is no outward cauſe for it, but that they are ſtruck with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of a more <hi>excellent ſpirit</hi> in theſe, carrying ſuch a reſemblance to the <hi>image of God,</hi> as forceth fear and ſubjection from <hi>that ſpirit which is in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Doth not a Chriſtian and holy walk cauſe men to <hi>ſhine as a light in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe generation?</hi> Yea, darken all their neighbours? And in the darkeſt night, is it not ſeen how grace ſhineth with the greateſt luſtre? what a ſweet and odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſcent doth this ſend through the country, where they live; that may ſhew to all, how great a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence there is betwixt ſuch, and thoſe who are wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this puddle of the earth!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is it not obvious, what a luſtre and beauty, yea, ſomething more becoming our immortal ſoul, that is in the <hi>ſelf-denial</hi> of Chriſtians, their bearing injuries, forgiving ſuch as injure them, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:005185_0260_1016DC46BB65B428"/>
than in that proud vindictive <hi>ſpirit that is in the world;</hi> that ſure ſuch walk by a more excellent rule, and move from a higher principle!</p>
               <p n="6">6. It may be alſo evident to the world, what an other ſpirit is in thoſe who do not <hi>run with the current of every time,</hi> nor <hi>yeild to men</hi> becauſe of their <hi>outward power,</hi> than in that ſpirit which is in the world? that while the one doth preſs men to ſave themſelves on any terms, the other doth cauſe the Chriſtian to <hi>take up his croſs,</hi> yea, <hi>lay down his life,</hi> to ſave his conſcience! And whence is that patience, and reſolution, by which the godly in times of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have overcome their perſecutors; their bold avowing of the truth before men, when hazards are moſt obvious; and that advantage, wherewith they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above others, in ſuch a time? O! doth it not clearly witneſs, they are of another mettal, who do thus abide the fire; yea, become more bright by that wherewith others are conſumed?</p>
               <p>I would add, that which the world cannot deny, how <hi>this ſpirit,</hi> which is in the <hi>Saints,</hi> hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over the greateſt <hi>entiſements</hi> of carnal gain and pleaſure, which to many may ſeem a wonder: as the Popiſh party did once ſay of <hi>Luther, Beſtia haec non curat aurum.</hi> That which they did ſpeak in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, that it did prove him a <hi>beaſt,</hi> did in effect ſhew him therein to be ſomething above <hi>men;</hi> for that is a thing before which the <hi>ſpirit of the world.</hi> could never ſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIFTH. That the promiſed encouragement, which is held forth to the People of God under trouble and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for his name, is a truth,</hi> and the Scripture herein verified, I am ſure, not only Chriſtian experience can witneſs; but may even to the obſervation of others, be demonſtrated from very convincing grounds, that it is no fancy or deluſion. <hi>Ps.</hi> 9. 9. <hi>Is.</hi> 51. 12.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="226" facs="unknown:005185_0261_1016DBFF020A6278"/>
1. The very <hi>countenance</hi> and <hi>outward appearance</hi> of the godly, in a ſuffering time, doth oft declare the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>tranquillity</hi> of their ſoul, ſo as ſurely they muſt have joy and ſatisfaction from <hi>whence the world doth not know,</hi> and have ſome other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, than with things viſible. For it may be oft ſaid, as of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and his fellows, that under greateſt preſſures and a very mean condition they <hi>look as well,</hi> yea, with as much <hi>chearfulneſs,</hi> as thoſe who live on the <hi>Kings allowance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It can be no counterfeit, which ſhould thus <hi>reconcile</hi> the chriſtian with a <hi>ſuffering</hi> lot. For it is known how very <hi>ſearching</hi> affliction and trouble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; which oft doth broach the veſſel, and bring forth what hath formerly moſt cloſely lurked. And O! Doth not that holy confidence and freedom, which the Saints have evidenced in confeſſing the truth, before the princes of this world and their moſt cruel adverſaries, yea, that chearfulneſs which in moſt extream articles of ſuffering they oft do witneſs, even when they are <hi>reſiſting to the blood;</hi> doth not this ſpeak forth ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the gallantry of a <hi>natural ſpirit,</hi> that far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ordinary way of men, and is a thing the world cannot but wonder, and whither they will, or will not, ſee God's very immediate help, and hand in the ſame, according to his word?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it not ſeen, how the chearful way of the Godly under ſuffering, while there is no outward ground for the ſame, doth not only aſtoniſh, but is an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>torment to adverſaries?</hi> when they are forced to ſee, how all their endeavours (when their wrath and malice hath been to the utmoſt put forth) have yet been in vain, either to turn them aſide, or to ruin their encouragement; but that the moſt ſharp ſufferings of the Godly do ſtill give <hi>them the foreſt daſh,</hi> help to ſtrengthen others, juſtify God's way, and that tender
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:005185_0262_1016DC4B48542038"/>
reſpect he hath to his ſuffering people, even before all obſervers!</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is it not alſo manifeſt, that ſuch whoſe <hi>natural</hi> diſpoſition was known to be very <hi>fainting</hi> and <hi>timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,</hi> yet when called to <hi>ſuffer for the truth,</hi> have with out the leaſt appearance of diſcouragement, ſhowed an invincible <hi>reſolution,</hi> and not only their own fears, but the expectations of others have a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſappointment! O is there not there a viſible ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Scripture, that <hi>ſhaking reeds</hi> ſhould be made to <hi>ſtand,</hi> were ſtrongeſt <hi>cedars</hi> have bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea, ſome of very mean and ordinary parts have been ſo diſcernably raiſed above themſelves, as they were made to confound the wiſe and learned!</p>
               <p n="5">5. Muſt it not be confeſſed, that the <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> of the ſaints did never <hi>more</hi> appear than in times of <hi>greateſt oppoſition?</hi> that at no time they have looked more, like Chriſtians with more advantage, and with ſome peculiar beauty and luſtre of the grace of God, than under <hi>ſuffering!</hi> a thing, which as it eminently doth commend the goſpel, hath alſo ſo far convinced their enemies, as in ſome meaſure it hath blunted their edge, and taken off their prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the way of God, and followers thereof.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I may appeal the greateſt Atheiſts to their conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, if any <hi>moral arguments,</hi> (whatever influence they may have upon men's patient enduring (could ever produce ſuch effects, as <hi>rejoycing in tribulation,</hi> the <hi>chooſing affliction</hi> before ſin and all its pleaſures; making men to triumph over perſecutors, and to go with ſuch a calm and chearfulneſs to a ſcaffold, to ſing amidſt a dark priſon, yea, and to <hi>abound,</hi> and <hi>have all things,</hi> under greateſt <hi>want?</hi> O! whence is this! Sure, ſomething <hi>above nature</hi> muſt be here, that is ſtronger than moral reaſons, by which the Saints have thus <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world!</hi> Yea, is it not obvious to all who look on, how great a difference there is betwixt the
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:005185_0263_1016DC00B811C280"/>
                  <hi>pretended</hi> reſolution of a natural ſpirit in death &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and that joy and confidence of a Chriſtian, which hath then ſhewed the compoſure and tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his ſoul within? The one being but a dark ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and the other drawn to the life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SIXTH. That there is a Conſcience within men, whoſe power both as a judge, and witneſs, doth anſwer that clear diſcovery, the Scripture giveth thereof,</hi> Rom. 2. 9. is a thing obvious even to the <hi>world,</hi> which they muſt needs confeſs, both from it's viſible effect on others, and the working thereof within themſelves. That herein the word is verified, theſe things make it clear and undeniable,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſure there is ſomething <hi>within,</hi> which thus maketh men <hi>afraid</hi> to be <hi>alone</hi> with themſelves, yea, will cauſe them to go abroad, and frame diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to be out of its noiſe: muſt it not be ſad earneſt, which hath ſo <hi>dreadful a ſound in their ear,</hi> doth haunt the wicked man whither he will, or not? wherewith he would gladly be at peace; but amidſt his greateſt mirth and proſperity this doth mingle his vine with gall and wormwood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it not alſo ſure, that men have oft an <hi>accuſer</hi> within their breaſt (while they ſeem to brave it out before others) whoſe judgment and ſentence they can by no means decline; but after the committing of ſin, yea, on the back of their ſinful pleaſures, doth follow the ſame with a <hi>bitter ſting,</hi> and ring this dreadful peal in their ear, that <hi>in the end their way will be bitterneſs!</hi> O! is not this an accuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which doth begin the torment of ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time?</p>
               <p n="3">3. What is it that ſhould make men's <hi>guilt</hi> ſo legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble oft in their <hi>countenance,</hi> even when they ſtudy moſt to conceal it, and thus cauſe them to give their tongue the lye; yea, bewray to byſtanders, whether
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:005185_0264_1016DC4FF4C45CA0"/>
they will or not, ſome ſecret trouble, and ſore they have within? Doth it not clearly ſhew the power of conſcience, which hath ſuch authority on men, that without violence or conſtraint from others, doth even force them to confeſs the truth, and ſupply the room of witneſſes;</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whence is it, that ſome are ſo much diſquieted for <hi>ſecret ſins,</hi> which the eyes of others could not reach, yea, that as to ſome <hi>groſs</hi> ſins, even the moſt profligate amongſt men, have an horror at them, without reſpect to <hi>outward</hi> hazard? Doth it not ſhew the power of natural conſcience, that holdeth forth a <hi>greater party,</hi> than the world with which they have to do, <hi>to whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> are manifeſt,</hi> and ſome <hi>greater witneſs</hi> than that of man?</p>
               <p n="5">5. How is it that even <hi>greateſt</hi> men, whom the world could not reach, and in he midſt of all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable advantages, have yet often moſt <hi>affrighting thoughts,</hi> much terror, and diſquieting reflections? Muſt it not be ſomething within, which doth cauſe them to fear, an other power than that of the world, and a judgment greater than of men?</p>
               <p n="6">6. What muſt it be which doth force men to <hi>juſtify God,</hi> when his hand doth purſue them, and maketh them ſo eaſily find out <hi>ſin</hi> in a time of their <hi>ſtrait?</hi> Why is the ſenſe of guilt ſo very affrighting at <hi>death?</hi> Is it not the conſcience, which doth preſage a future <hi>judgment,</hi> and extend its power to matters of an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting concernment and duration?</p>
               <p n="7">7. What ſhould make men <hi>tremble at the word,</hi> and ſo much hate a <hi>ſearching</hi> miniſtry! Is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the light doth torment them? That though the word doth particularly name none, yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within, which maketh application of the truth, and doth plainly ſay, <hi>Thou art the man!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. How do the worſt of men oft <hi>juſtify</hi> thoſe in <hi>ſecret,</hi> whom they <hi>openly</hi> have <hi>condemned:</hi> that
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:005185_0265_1016DC04F639F540"/>
while they are even perſecuting the ſaints for truth, and holineſs, yet for theſe they give them and their way a favourable teſtimony, notwithſtanding all their prejudices? Yea, what is it that doth cauſe a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret fear and awful regard of ſuch whom they hate?—Doth it not ſhew ſomething within, whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they are not able to reſiſt?</p>
               <p n="9">9. I muſt further aſk, whence is that <hi>horror,</hi> and thoſe dreadful cries and groans, which <hi>wicked</hi> men oft have in their ſickneſs, even ſuch who were wont to ſport at ſin, with a daring countenance? Can the world get this paſt without ſome remark, how intolerable a thing an evil Conſcience is, when once let looſe? when in all ages ſuch terrifying examples of this kind have been ſet up, for all that paſt by to look on, ſuch as <hi>Spira, Latomus. Olivarius, &amp;c.</hi> And truly I think, it is a great Defect, that there ſhould not be a more particular <hi>record</hi> of ſuch, which would give Atheiſm ſo great a daſh; yea, force men to confeſs the truth of a Deity, and of the written word.</p>
               <p>(¶) This is a great truth, &amp; a great demonſtration of God (bleſſed for ever!) his being, and of the truth of his word, that there is a <hi>Conſcience:</hi> ſo ſtrange a power, which every man hath within him and over him, that forceth the ſoul to a <hi>reflection on it ſelf,</hi> even when it trembles at that ſight, and with an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound tells the Atheiſt, there is a God, when he ſeems to have no fear or conviction thereof! This is that great tormentor and troubler of the world, from which there is no retreat, though one ſhould flee to the uttermoſt parts of the earth: this keeps a high court of juſtice under the authority of the great Judge, and there without reſpect of perſons does ſummons great and ſmall, does arreſt, bring in witneſs, &amp; paſſes ſentence, yea, in ſome meaſure puts that in execution,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:005185_0266_1016DC51CAD17C48"/>
and can make hell begin there, by an unexpreſſible anguiſh and horror. It is ſtrange, that ſuch a thing, when it is ſo undeniable, does not ſtare the world in the face with more amazement. But I ſhall further offer ſome few evidences of this truth, beſides thoſe already mentioned.</p>
               <p>(1.) Could there be ſuch a Power in man to <hi>differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> betwixt that <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> which is within him, if there were not alſo ſome <hi>higher power</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him, who hath thus formed him, with ſuch principles? Yea, could there be a judging and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing within a man, if there were not a law &amp; rule over him? For it is ſure, the conſcience in all its actings hath reſpect to a higher judgment, and to a law, which even nature's light, though very dim, holds forth, but is expreſs and clear in the Scripture which is that great rule of the Conſcience.—(2.) Is it not very ſtrange, to ſee ſuch a power <hi>within a man,</hi> and yet <hi>againſt</hi> him; that the groſſeſt Atheiſt is an enemy to it, yet cannot be without it, or get it ſhaken off; and whilſt it is known how ſtrong a byaſs and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation theſe have to <hi>evil,</hi> more than <hi>good,</hi> they are yet forced to juſtify the one, more than the other! The drunkard cannot drown this conviction, nor the worldling bury it in the earth, where his treaſure lies.—(3.) Though men may come ſome length to <hi>divert</hi> the conſcience, and <hi>ſilence</hi> it, that it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe its function, without ſome ſpecial divine excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet is it not manifeſt, how then when <hi>once</hi> it is <hi>awaked,</hi> there is no poſſible <hi>withſtanding!</hi> Then the ſtout-hearted cannot keep his ground, to debate with it; yea, when they run, it follows with as ſwift a pace; no ſkill, no arguments can defend from its force; there is no violence againſt ſuch a power, but whilſt in the practice of ſin they overreach the witneſs of men, lo! this is continually at hand to tell them, that He who is greater than the conſcience,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:005185_0267_1016DC0687497698"/>
do's regard.—(4.) Can any thing be more real and certain, than theſe effects of the conſcience, I mean that <hi>trouble</hi> and fear men have in <hi>ſinning,</hi> and that <hi>peace</hi> and ſatisfaction that attends <hi>well-doing;</hi> Do you know ſuch a place of the earth, whither this power hath not ſome acceſs to over-aw men, even without any viſible aw or hazard? And can all mankind, through the whole World, in all ages, be in ſo ſtrange a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if there were no real ground for it?—(5.) How convincingly do's this witneſs to a conſcience, and the reality of it, that men are at ſo much work to <hi>bribe</hi> it, to frame <hi>diverſions</hi> thereto, yea, to find out falſe grounds of <hi>peace,</hi> and ſome ſuch gloſs and commentary, as many reconcile the rule with their groſſeſt actings and exorbitancies? And why is this, but that in outdaring it, they find it ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then they, and therefore muſt counterwork, by darkening that great light, and find out ſome ſhew of reaſon to ſilence conſcience, and promiſe peace to themſelves, though they walk in the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their heart.—(6.) Do not theſe ſtrange <hi>extreams,</hi> which oft are obvious in men's condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, witneſs the reality of this power? O what a marvellous thing, to ſee one ſtupid, this day; and deſperate the next, the conſcience breaking out, at that rate, that to be rid thereof and its torment, the poor man would ſeek a ſhelter in the grave? Yea, is it not uſual to ſee ſome wear out their time as beaſts, yet at dying ſeized with an inexpreſſible horror of God? Is not this ſomething wakened, which was formerly aſleep?—(7.) Do not men ſee ſuch <hi>deſparate</hi> acts of wickedneſs in the World, ſuch <hi>furious</hi> running over warnings and convictions, that may even convincingly ſhew ſome purſuit of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that horrid way they take to be rid of it by revenge, to give it a further wound and ſilence its noyſe, by ſome violent deep ſtroke!—(8.) Are not
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:005185_0268_1016DC54C61528D0"/>
theſe <hi>ſudden</hi> unlooked for <hi>out-breakings</hi> of the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence moſt remarkable; how it takes ſome <hi>unawares</hi> and grows upon them, the more they ſtrive with it? It is known alſo, what <hi>reflections</hi> men uſually have on themſelves and their actions, in ſome preſent <hi>exigent</hi> and <hi>hazard;</hi> yea, how they are thus affrighted, or in ſome meaſure quiet, as they are put to condemn or acquit themſelves on that ſcore. Now is not this a convincing witneſs of the force of a natural conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; And likewiſe that uſual recourſe, which the groſſeſt of men will in ſuch an extremity have to God by <hi>prayer,</hi> do's both declare this, and that impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they have upon them of a Deity.—(9.) How marvellous a <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>ſupport</hi> do's the conſcience afford where it is a <hi>friend,</hi> under the greateſt miſery and trouble from without; For thus <hi>a man's ſpirit can ſuſtain its infirmities.</hi> But O when it is an <hi>adverſary,</hi> nothing (nothing) ſo <hi>unſupportable;</hi> it will torment and tear one within, when there is none without dare provoke him; yea, cauſe the oppreſſor to tremble, whilſt it upholds the oppreſſed with confidence; it makes the one eat his bread with joy, when it imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the pleaſant morſels of others.

               <p>
                  <hi>SEVENTH. That there is a reward for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and unqueſtionable gain in Godlineſs,</hi> is a piece of the Scripture not only well known, and witneſſed to the obſerving Chriſtian in his experience, but is alſo held forth in every age, as in great letters to the view of the world. <hi>Ps.</hi> 58. 11. <hi>Ps.</hi> 97. 11. <hi>Is.</hi> 3. 10. It is true, that the Chriſtians lot is oft followed with much trouble, and ſometimes with loſs of his life, which may ſeem to have a very diſmal aſpect. For that great goodneſs, which the man who feareth God, hath enſured to him, is much laid up in another world: but it is alſo ſure, that there are ſuch clear convincing proofs of this truth held forth
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:005185_0269_1016DC0C5F143CE0"/>
even to the obſervation of men, by which the Lord hath in every age confirmed the ſame, that I am ſure the greateſt Atheiſt cannot anſwer even theſe.—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this is the very dictate of a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not only that <hi>God is,</hi> but that he is <hi>a rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of ſuch as ſerve him: yea, none amongſt men are ſo groſs, or brutiſh, who are not in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure principled to <hi>difference</hi> betwixt <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> with ſome fear of a puniſhment to the one, and ſome hope of recompence to the other; and are alſo forced to notice ſome more ſignal and convincing examples, which have been of that kind in their time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Muſt we not ſay, yea, doth not the World ſee, in every age, that hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in ſome part <hi>acted over again?</hi> Sure, there have not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ſuch remarkable inſtances, wherein it might be eaſy to trace an upright and ſtraight walk through a very maze and labyrinth of changes, and to ſhow how that hath been their condition, &amp; at laſt integrity hath brought them to land in a comfortable harbour; yea, how often they have had a marvellous, unlooked for relief, contrary to all humane appearance. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is no romance; but a moſt true hiſtory, which through all times, and many examples, might be written of the Word and providence, which would ſurpaſs the richeſt fancy, that any fiction or romance did ever contain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Muſt it not be convincing, even to the worſt of men, what a <hi>viſible bleſſing</hi> doth oft follow the <hi>mean lot</hi> of ſome of the <hi>Saints,</hi> which can make their <hi>little</hi> reach far, and cauſe them to <hi>abound</hi> more in their <hi>poverty,</hi> than others amidſt their abundance? Which, I think, the world cannot ſhun to obſerve, and gather that there is ſurely ſomething elſe than mens own care, which doth their buſineſs: and how that ordinary proverb falleth not to the ground, that <hi>it is better to be happy than wiſe,</hi> when they ſee a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

               <p n="4">4. May not the world ſee, there is a <hi>feaſt</hi> in a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> how little ſoever they partake of the World? that well doing, and the practiſe of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſome preſent <hi>reward</hi> in its hand? Whereas ſo remarkable a difference may be diſcerned betwixt the countenance and carriage of ſuch, and of them who truſt in falſhood, that ſurely in a time of ſtrait, thoſe have another kind of ſecurity and confidence, when greateſt natural ſpirits fail; yea, that thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can enjoy themſelves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="6">6. That thoſe who are faithful in their life, and diligent improvers of a ſmall talent, have uſually more added, with ſome diſcernable growth follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame: and as the drying up of the parts of ſome, as a judgment on unfaithfulneſs, is oft ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, ſo alſo ſuch a bleſſing upon ſerious diligence, as hath made the <hi>laſt</hi> to be <hi>firſt,</hi> and even outrun ſuch who were once before them.

               <p n="7">7. Doth not the Lord put ſome <hi>viſible difference</hi> oft, betwixt the <hi>righteous</hi> and the <hi>wicked</hi> in a time of common <hi>calamity?</hi> that a ſtrange deliverance with the concurrence of very marvellous providences, doth ſometime await ſuch, even to the conviction of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; which may tell the World, ſuch have had an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible hedge</hi> of preſervation about them, and have been under ſome better care, than their own.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>EIGHT. That verily there is a God who judgeth in the earth, Ps.</hi> 58. 11. who doth <hi>render unto men vengeance,</hi> and doth <hi>purſue the tranſgreſſor,</hi> becauſe of ſin, is a truth, which the world hath in every age by many convincing inſtances held forth to them, where they may ſee the Scripture clearly verifyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="unknown:005185_0272_1016DC5A8038B3A0"/>
I have a little touched this in the ſecond Argument how the accompliſhing of Scripture threatnings is witneſſed to the obſervation of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to thoſe who are <hi>wiſe to diſcern the times,</hi> wherein they live. I ſhall here point at this truth, as it is in the providence of God, written in ſuch great letters, as are obvious to the view of the <hi>World,</hi> ſo as moſt common obſervers cannot paſs this without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark. It is true, much may be laid over to that great general aſſize of the laſt judgment, that day of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution; yea, ſometimes we ſee the moſt wicked and vile go in peace to the grave; the ſovereignty of God doth alſo appear very obſervably in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meaſure and kind of puniſhment; and it is too evident, how prone men are to look more to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that ſecond cauſes have in ſuch a thing, than to a divine hand: but this is alſo ſure, that <hi>the Lord is known on the earth by the judgments which he executeth,</hi> and in every age doth ſet up ſuch convincing examples before men, that the greateſt Atheiſt may ſee, yea, oft their conſcience muſt break the jay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, reſtrain it as they will, and force this acknowledgement, that ſuch judgments can be no caſual thing; while ſomething of a power higher than man, and a clear verifying of the word, are ſo diſcernable therein.</p>
               <p>Now to demonſtrate this truth, I would offer ſome things which may ſhew how very near this cometh to the obſervation of men, ſo as none can be a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereto, or want conviction of this piece of the truth of God, except they willingly ſhut their eyes, while it is clear,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the very <hi>Heathens,</hi> who never knew the Scripture, nor a written Law, have yet ſo much of a natural <hi>conſcience,</hi> that not only <hi>they</hi> can put ſome <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>vice,</hi> but even in ſome meaſure can diſcern <hi>God'</hi>s putting ſome difference betwixt the ſame, and how flagitious <hi>crimes</hi> uſe to be
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:005185_0273_1016DC10E286D248"/>
                  <hi>puniſhed by a divine hand.</hi> We may ſay, time could never yet wear out the obſervation of this truth, through the World: &amp; though many things may be received and credited, which not having a ſure ground do quickly evaniſh (it being truth's priviledge ſtill to out live falſhood) yet it is ſure, how in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt parts of the earth, this hath been ſtill noticed with a ſpecial remark, &amp; tranſmitted from one age to another; yea, the records of the nations, even by heathen writers, ſhew what remarkable puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath followed cruel oppreſſion, Covenant-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſuch other groſs ſins againſt the ſecond ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yea, how theſe have been the uſual forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of great ſtrokes on Kingdoms and families.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Doth not the World ſee, that in thoſe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>judgments,</hi> which have come on a <hi>Nation</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> there is ſomething <hi>higher</hi> than <hi>inſtruments,</hi> or ſecond cauſes, which may be very evident in bringing the ſame about: ſo that all who go by, muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, ſuch is no caſual occurrence, nor doth ariſe out of the duſt, but that ſurely a <hi>divine</hi> hand is there? And truly, though ſome deſolating ſtrokes are very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in themſelves, and blood and ruins ſhould be no matter of pleaſure; yet, whereas thereby that ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſound is heard, even <hi>his voice who maketh the earth to tremble,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> is made known to the ſons of men, we ſhould not only with fear, but even ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly congratulation conſider his work. Now to clear what a convincing witneſs theſe are to this truth, I ſhall point at ſome very obvious remarks, which I am ſure the World cannot contradict, of the Lord's own immediate hand in ſuch judgments.—(1.) That ſtrange <hi>concurrence</hi> of providences, which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to appear when <hi>God is againſt a People;</hi> how all things will then conſpire, as a fatal conjunction, to work their wo and ruin, that men may ſee, ſurely <hi>this is from the Lord, who is wonderful in counſel,</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="unknown:005185_0274_1016DC5C844AF7F0"/>
and from a hand againſt which there is no ſtriving. (2.) How ſuch remarkable <hi>ſtrokes</hi> are ſeen to fall in with ſome great and remarkable height of <hi>ſin</hi> in ſuch a nation and People; ſo that it is eaſy then for all lookers on to confeſs the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of God thereon.—(3.) When judgment is coming on a land, it may appear how <hi>inſtruments</hi> are raiſed, and in a more then ordinary way acted with all advantages for ſuch a piece of ſervice.—(4.) There is a viſible <hi>blaſting</hi> then both of <hi>counſel</hi> and <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and thoſe means, which otherways looked moſt probable; how remarkably ſuch are confounded, even in the uſe of their ordinary abilities, &amp; their heart &amp; uſual courage taken from them, while the Lord is on a work of judgment.—(5.) That aſtoniſhing <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> which is uſually ſeen to follow thoſe whom <hi>the Lord ſendeth forth</hi> to execute his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; how then they move ſwiftly, &amp; with vigour; they do not ſtumble, or weary; it is neither rivers nor walled cities can ſtand in their way; mountains are made vallies, to ſhew <hi>it is the Lord, whoſe hand in that day is ſtrong upon them,</hi> to ſtrengthen their loins, and make the ſword and ax ſharp for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. (6.) Amidſt theſe various ſtrokes which come on a land, can men paſs that of the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> without ſome ſpecial note? where <hi>God'</hi>s immediate hand, ſomething ſupernatural, above ordinary or natural cauſes, may be clearly ſeen, in its ſtrange progreſs and ſpreading, which like lightning doth oft go through cities and countrys in a ſmall time! Do not theſe tell, aloud to the World that they come not unſent, and without ſome ſpecial commiſſion; and that there is no ſtriving againſt them, nor are ordinary means effectual in ſome ſuch extraordinary plagues, until he who brought it on, do alſo by his own hand take it off.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Very obvious even to the world is that clear <hi>reſemblance,</hi> which is oft betwixt <hi>ſin,</hi> and the ſtroke: how holy juſtice doth keep a proportion,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:005185_0275_1016DC126CB265E8"/>
and doth ſhape out the judgment ſo exactly, both in meaſure and kind, that it may be eaſy to ſee the <hi>ſtroke</hi> pointing (as with an hand) to the <hi>cauſe,</hi> by its diſcernable likeneſs; and both at the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which thus meaſure out to men, as they have dealt with others. We ſee how the Lord judged <hi>Agag,</hi> and <hi>Adonibezeck;</hi> how <hi>Sodom'</hi>s burning luſt was puniſhed with fire from heaven: Yea, what even <hi>David</hi> had meaſured out for his murder and adultery; for the one, <hi>the ſword ſhall not depart from his houſe,</hi> and for the other, his <hi>wives</hi> by his own ſon <hi>abuſed.</hi> And truly every age's obſervation can witneſs this truth from many convincing examples, <hi>that there is a God who judgeth in the earth.</hi> It being oft ſeen if men would ſeriouſly obſerve, (1.) How an univerſal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreading of ſin in a land, hath uſually ſome national and univerſal ſtroke following.—(2.) That <hi>blood</hi> wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on <hi>bloody</hi> men, and ſuffereth them not oft to live out half their days; one oppreſſor puniſhed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the unmerciful man payed home in his own coin, by ſuch as ſhall ſhew as little mercy to him, or his.—(3.) How the proud and inſolent, who do moſt hunt after outward glory, are uſually puniſhed with ſome humbling abaſing ſtroke. <hi>He poureth Contempt on princes;</hi> and ſuch who will not honour God, ſhall not obtain that honour they ſeek from men.—(4.) That ſuch who have been moſt given up to <hi>Uncleanneſs,</hi> are oft ſeen not to increaſe as to their <hi>Poſterity,</hi> but their iſſue obſervably made to fail; yea, by a divine hand rooted out: ſure many ſuch ſignal examples might be inſtanced.—(5.) How ſuch who have choſen <hi>ſin,</hi> to ſhun <hi>trouble</hi> and ſuffering, have in their ſinful way got as large a meaſure thereof, as that man, who in Q. <hi>Mary'</hi>s time ſaid, he could not burn for the truth, and therefore forſook it, by an unſeen hand, had both himſelf and his houſe in one night burnt.—(6.) That the <hi>treacherous</hi> and deceitful men are thus dealt with by
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:005185_0276_1016DC5FAAC15BB8"/>
others, yea, children who have been <hi>undutiful</hi> to their parents, have from their's met with the ſame recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.—(7.) That whilſt men, to make a <hi>purchaſe,</hi> have even denied themſelves the <hi>neceſſary uſe</hi> of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, they are oft ſeen to leave their eſtate to ſuch, who do quickly <hi>waſte</hi> and <hi>ſcatter</hi> the ſame; and thus the ſinful parſimony of parents is puniſhed with the prodigality of ſuch who ſucceed them.—(8.) That the frequent uſe of ſome dreadful <hi>imprecations</hi> is oft puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord with a <hi>ſuitable</hi> ſtroke, to the conviction both of themſelves and obſervers (9) How ſuch as have <hi>joyned</hi> together, and united themſelves againſt the <hi>truth,</hi> have been viſibly <hi>broken</hi> as to their own private intereſt: and truly we muſt ſay, there is oft ſuch a conjunction of very convincing circumſtances, in ſome acts of the judgment of God, with ſuch a <hi>reſemblance</hi> to the <hi>ſin,</hi> yea, judgment ſometimes purſuing men in the very <hi>place,</hi> where the ſin hath been acted, that it may be eaſy for all who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, to ſay, there is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>God who judgeth in the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Doth it not appear, how very convincing and obvious this truth is even to the World, from thoſe <hi>ordinary remarks</hi> and <hi>proverbial ſayings,</hi> which we find in all ages and in every part of the earth, even the moſt <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> have had, of the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God.</hi> For truly what elſe are theſe but an expreſs witneſs, how univerſally this truth is known, and received by men, how much the World is convinced thereof, through a long tract of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the fathers to the children: yea, thence they have had a divinity of their own, drawn out thereof; how ſuch ſins do not uſe to paſs without ſome exemplary puniſhment. Now I would but name ſome few of theſe remarks, that have been moſt uſual in all times. (1.) How ſome <hi>families have not thriven,</hi> but a ſecret judgment hath been diſcernable thereon, ſince they had hand in ſome groſs acts of
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:005185_0277_1016DC172733D3E0"/>
                  <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> ſuch as bloodſhed; their former proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity from ſuch a day viſibly declining.—(2.) How that an <hi>evil purchaſe</hi> uſeth not to be of <hi>long continuance,</hi> but their eſtate oft in a very ſtrange and unſenſible may made to vaniſh, which their children though frugal can by no means keep up: and the cauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of men do eaſily point at, it was purchaſed by <hi>fraud,</hi> tranſmitted with a curſe cleaving thereto, and ſo there was no warding off the judgment of God.—(3.) Such who do not much conſider God's controverſy, yet are oft forced to remark, that ſince ſome have medled or matched with <hi>ſuch an houſe,</hi> they have ſadly ſmarted thereby, ſomething of a <hi>curſe</hi> even following the <hi>race</hi> and poſterity of ſome.—(4.) How <hi>ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> medling with that which hath been for a pious and publick uſe, hath cauſed a viſible waſte and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in their own eſtate.—(5.) That men's aſking counſel from the <hi>Devil,</hi> &amp; turning to that quarter for their help, doth uſually reſolve in a ſad and <hi>tragick</hi> cloſe; and truly this, many in the ſhutting up of their life have been forced to confeſs.—(6.) That <hi>falſhood</hi> doth not uſe to <hi>keep its feet,</hi> nor a <hi>wicked way long proſper,</hi> what ever it ſeem to at the firſt view: yea, I may add, as one of the world's remarks, which they cannot well ſhun, that which ſeemeth was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſaying in the time of <hi>Eſther,</hi> that it is not ſafe <hi>troubling the Church,</hi> or for men to ſtate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in oppoſition to that party; &amp; I dare not queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but this ſhall be yet as convincing and obvious to the World, as it hath been in any former ages.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Is not the appearance of a divine hand oft very obvious to the World in the <hi>diſcovery of ſin,</hi> and bringing to light ſome groſs acts of wickedneſs, even in extraordinary way? while its ſeen, (1.) By what <hi>ſtrange unexpected means</hi> theſe have been brought forth; ſuch an aſtoniſhing affliction, &amp; concurrence of things therein, as hath forced not only lookers on to
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:005185_0278_1016DC6404AFE7C8"/>
ſome ſpecial remark, but hath even ſtruck the guilty party through the heart with wonder, and conviction of the ſame.—(2.) How the hand of Juſtice purſuing men for ſome notorious, and publick crime, doth oft bring to light ſome that have been moſt <hi>ſecret,</hi> which they thought the World could never reach: yea, it may be frequently ſeen while men have been in <hi>one</hi> fin found out, it hath alſo brought forth the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſome <hi>other,</hi> and forced them to confeſs, that it was a righteous judgment purſuing them for the ſame. It is a thing alſo known, yea, by many undeniable inſtances witneſſed, that marvellous diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of concealed <hi>murder,</hi> by the bleeding of the body upon the touch of the murderer. I confeſs, it ſhould be hard to aſſert the lawful and warrantable practice of ſuch an appeal to ſo extraordinary and ſtupendous a ſign from the Lord, where Scripture goeth not clearly before us: but on the other hand, ſuch a thing ſo ſurely tryed for ſuch an end, and in the caſe where all ordinary means of diſcovery have been wanting, I think, calleth us to a ſerious remark thereof, while it ſo viſibly ſeemeth to witneſs his hand, who doth <hi>make inquiſition for blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Is not the dreadful <hi>conſternation,</hi> thoſe torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>fears,</hi> which men after ſome groſs acts of <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi> do bewray, a very obvious witneſs to this truth, <hi>that there is a God who judgeth on the earth, in whoſe hands it is a terrible thing to fall,</hi> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, how great a <hi>puniſhment</hi> wickedneſs is to <hi>its ſelf?</hi> Truly if Atheiſts turn not brutiſh and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, they muſt notice this, and confeſs a thing which doth ſo oft reach their ears, what have been the horrid <hi>crys</hi> of many <hi>dying</hi> men, who have moſt ſported with ſin in their life; that may tell ſtanders by, there is a <hi>Judge</hi> who can <hi>ſtretch forth his hand</hi> on the <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> whereto no rack or outward torment is any way comparable.</p>

I would further add; thoſe extraordinary <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>prodigies,</hi> which do uſually go before ſome ſtroke and judgment on a land, do they not clearly point at a <hi>divine hand</hi> in the ſame? For as theſe are a ſolemn forewarning from Heaven, to give men an alarm, before remarkable changes, the truth whereof the World cannot deny; ſo we muſt ſay, they are a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing teſtimony, that theſe judgments are no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual things, which the Atheiſt cannot anſwer; it being ſo clear, (1.) That ſuch ſigns and prodigies have been in <hi>every age</hi> viſible to the World's experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the graveſt hiſtories both of ancient and latter times, do fully witneſs.—(2.) That ſuch things ſhould alſo be previous to great revolutions in the World, we know the <hi>Scripture</hi> is moſt expreſs, <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. 30. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 11. And as we ſhould guard againſt any ſuperſtitious reſpect, we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo beware of ſtupid Atheiſtical inadvertency at theſe ſtrange works of the Lord, which call both for fear and obſervation.—(3.) That ſuch have been uſually previous to <hi>great</hi> calamities and judgments on a People, is a thing that all ages muſt witneſs; even thoſe, who have been moſt cautious and diſcerning in their time, who could not ſhun this as a remark. <hi>Herodotus</hi> doth ſet that down as a thing moſt ſure, in his ſixth Book. <hi>Cum Deus puniturus eſt gentem &amp; urbem prodigiis, id ſolet ſignificare.</hi> And <hi>Lucan</hi> could tell what went before the Romans civil wars,—<hi>Superique minaces Prodigiis terras implerunt.</hi> Yea, it can hardly be inſtanced any great change or revolution in the earth, which hath not had ſome ſuch extraordinary Herald going before.—(4.) Can the World deny how ſometimes theſe prodigious ſigns have been ſhaped out to <hi>point at the very nature of the ſtroke</hi> then imminent, by a ſtrange <hi>reſemblance</hi> to the ſame; ſuch as a flaming ſword in the air, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of armies fighting even ſometimes upon the

earth, to the view of many, moſt ſober and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spectators, alſo ſhowers of blood, the noiſe of drums, and ſuch like, which are known uſually to go before wars and commotions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NINTH. That there are evil ſpirits, (Eph.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2, 3.) and <hi>a Diabolical power,</hi> ſuch as the Scripture hath held forth, <hi>whoſe conſtant work is the ruin and undoing of man,</hi> is a truth, not only wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed from that experience Chriſtians have of their aſſault but is undeniable by the world, and greateſt Atheiſts, except they deny the diſcovery of ſenſe, as well as reaſon.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, it may cauſe fear &amp; aſtoniſhment, to think on this, that ſpirits ſo knowing and once originally excellent, have fallen thus into ſuch an height of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt infinite goodneſs, that it is now their only aim and pleaſure, to <hi>diſhonour God,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy his image in man.</hi> It ſhould indeed cauſe us to fear him, that <hi>ſpared not the Angels who ſinned.</hi> But the truth it ſelf is ſure, that ſuch a party is at this day encompaſſing the earth, and trafficking up and down there: to prove which by arguments, were to light a candle to let men ſee that it is day, while it is known what ordinary familiar converſe many have therewith, and alas too eaſy to diſcern that <hi>power,</hi> which the <hi>prince of this World</hi> hath upon the <hi>children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</hi> How obvious are the marks of his conqueſt almoſt every where; Thouſands lying in his chains! How far do we ſee many transformed into the very image of the Devil; which in thoſe deſperate prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious acts of wickedneſs that are oft in the world, may appear; ſuch, whereat we ſhould think human nature, though corrupt, could not but tremble, yea, look on with horror! how many in all ages have even been in an expreſs <hi>covenant</hi> with them? and is not there a great part of the earth, where the <hi>Devil</hi> is viſibly and
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:005185_0281_1016DC1C9C013C38"/>
audibly known, where he hath a kind of neighbourhood with men? But there being no need for ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, I only here aim to hold forth what a concerning truth this is, and of great conſequence, if ſeriouſly conſidered; yea, how both the Scripture, and Chriſtian Religion, is hereby evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſince theſe things muſt neceſſarily follow,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in this the Scripture is truly fulfilled, which doth witneſs <hi>what</hi> theſe Spirits are, <hi>adverſaries</hi> to man; in their nature and Inclination deſperately evil; whoſe actings in the earth have a viſible ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to men's hurt and ruin; yea, their pretended ſavours always directed to that end; whence we ſee ſuch a natural inbred horror, which is in man againſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is no <hi>common</hi> thing, which they ſo much purſue; ſomething more precious than the body, for which ſo great and cruel an adverſary is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual labour; for their actings have no ſuch tendency to ruin men's eſtate in the World: no, it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, this is the <hi>ſoul,</hi> the immortal ſoul, to undo them in that great intereſt, is the mark, whereat they level; that poor man might be ſharer of that miſery, under which <hi>they</hi> are concluded.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it not an undeniable conſequence of this truth, that there muſt be an <hi>inviſible World,</hi> that hath inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>another kind</hi> than ſuch as are here; that ſure there is ſome being above man; yea, a real correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt men and Spirits? And ſhould not man, thus placed in a middle eſtate betwixt the Angels and the beaſts here below, partaking in his <hi>body</hi> with the one, but in his reaſonable <hi>ſoul</hi> with the other, thence raiſe himſelf to thoughts of ſome more <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> condition, for which he is framed, than a <hi>ſenſual</hi> life; and that ſurely the <hi>ſoul</hi> hath an intereſt in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world, which he ſhould moſt look after?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="247" facs="unknown:005185_0282_1016DC69C0AA9FB0"/>
4. Muſt not this alſo be ſure, that there is an <hi>inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble guard;</hi> and theſe deſperate Spirits are under <hi>reſtraint,</hi> by a power ſtronger than they, which can bound their malice? For, this may be certain, that theſe who have ſo great enmity to man who are ſo near, and have ſuch advantages over us, could not keep at ſuch a diſtance, but that they are kept in chains by a higher power.</p>
               <p n="5">5. How is it that <hi>now</hi> by the Goſpel and within this precinct of the Church, <hi>Satan's</hi> power is ſo much <hi>reſtrained,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>former</hi> times; while it is known, what a familiar converſe they had with men, did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven haunt their houſes, and were ſo publick in their appearance under ſuch names of <hi>Faries</hi> and <hi>Brounies,</hi> which ſince the breaking out of the light of the Goſpel hath not been? Yea, hath not the Devil to this day an open throne and dominion in thoſe parts of the earth, where Chriſt is not worſhipped? It is alſo known, how the oracles of old did ceaſe, and that publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which the world for many ages had given them, with the very time of Chriſt's appearance, and breaking out of the Goſpel; theſe night-beaſts getting to their dens, when once the day was broke. <hi>Plutarch</hi> and other heathen writers are witneſs to this.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whence is it that <hi>within the Church,</hi> where Satan is moſt reſtrained, yet there he doth <hi>more ſtir,</hi> than in all the world beſides? Doth it not ſhew, that that is the party with which he is <hi>at war?</hi> Hence doth he more <hi>rage,</hi> the more clear the light ſhineth: yea, is there not ſeen ſomething, beſides men's natural en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity at the truth, even a fury and violence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome are viſibly driven, in their acting with ſuch an unſatiable cruelty againſt the followers of Chriſt, without the leaſt ſhadow of provocation, as holds forth a lively reſemblance of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent preſſure and incitement from that quarter!</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="248" facs="unknown:005185_0283_1016DC1E876232A0"/>
7. Is it not ſure, that there is ſuch a party, by this, that he is an adverſary to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>holineſs;</hi> for which reaſon he doth ſo impetuouſly tempt and preſs men to the outward acts of <hi>ſin?</hi> Yea, that there is a <hi>Spirit of blaſphemy,</hi> which ſo viſibly rageth in the world, and acts men to war againſt Heaven with their tongues, by curſing and blaſphemous oaths, which hath no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal pleaſure or gain, but yet they can not forbear; from a violent <hi>incitement,</hi> which may be ſeen ſwaying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o the ſame.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whence is it, which is ſo very known and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious that thoſe horrid wretches who <hi>give themſelves to the Devil,</hi> cannot enter in any formal engagement without <hi>renouncing Chriſt</hi> and their <hi>baptiſm?</hi> doth at not ſhew that direct oppoſition he ſtands in to Chriſt, yea, to the very name and ſhadow of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whence is it that even the groſſeſt <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> upon any appearance of the <hi>Devil,</hi> or apprehenſion from that quarter, will not <hi>then</hi> make ſcorn of prayer, but burn in earneſt to that, which at <hi>other</hi> times they mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? O doth it not ſhew, men's Atheiſm is their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that not only there is a dreadful horror and fear, which by nature men have of theſe <hi>evil Spirits,</hi> but ſome inbred ſenſe alſo and impreſſion of a <hi>Deity,</hi> which doth bewray it ſelf, whither they will or not, in a preſſing ſtrait and extremity!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>TENTH. That there is ſuch an enmity betwixt the ſeed of the woman, and the Serpent,</hi> as the Scripture hath held forth, is very manifeſt: a truth, wherein the world may ſee the Scripture clearly verified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29.</p>
               <p>It is truly ſtrange, that this putteth not men to more ſerious thoughts, to purſue ſuch a thing to its true riſe, what ſhould cauſe ſuch a violent and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable contrariety againſt the ways and followers of God; for here, upon grave reflections, they muſt needs

ſee, that their way in this is a convincing witneſs to the truth of the Scripture, which might put them in ſome other humour, yea, help to turn this poiſon into an antidote againſt it ſelf. But this is ſure and undeniable, the diſcovery whereof cannot but ſtare the greateſt Atheiſt in the face, from theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is ſeen, no <hi>private quarrel</hi> which ever was among men, hath been with ſuch <hi>vigour</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> purſued, as this upon the account of <hi>religion;</hi> which hath ſtill put the World more in a flame, than any private intereſt: yea, it is very manifeſt how men are carried with the ſtream of their own natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to oppoſe the Church and People of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this ſeed and enmity could <hi>

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

No, the moſt ſage and wiſe amongſt men, the greateſt Peace-makers, could yet never fall on a way to reconcile theſe two parties; but the children have ſtill ſerved themſelves heirs to the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel and hatred of their fathers againſt the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is it not ſeen, that thoſe who are more <hi>civil,</hi> and can hold a little up with the <hi>form</hi> of religion, yet will break forth in greateſt <hi>rage</hi> againſt the <hi>power</hi> thereof, when once it begins to appear? It is indeed here, that inbred contrariety, which is in men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt holineſs, doth bewray it ſelf, even in thoſe who are otherways noted for a <hi>calm</hi> and peaceable diſpoſition, while once they begin to be <hi>ſcorcht</hi> with its heat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What ſtrong natural <hi>antipathy</hi> is this, which cauſeth men to purſue with ſo much <hi>bitterneſs</hi> thoſe from whom they never had any perſonal <hi>injury?</hi> Sure their conſcience muſt oft tell, that they have no reaſon, or any other provocation, than what is from the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:005185_0285_1016DC21241A89D8"/>
of the <hi>image of God</hi> in ſuch: but this is their <hi>nature</hi> and diſpoſition, an <hi>enmity</hi> which they can no more help, than they can change their <hi>nature,</hi> or the <hi>Leopard can change its ſpots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Form what a <hi>ſtrong inclination,</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> principle, doth the World thus act in its oppoſition to the Church and followers of God? whileſt it is clear, though theſe were never ſo quiet and peaceable yet their enemies are ſtill reſtleſs, and cannot ſleep beſide them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is ſeen, how this doth <hi>ſeparate</hi> betwixt neareſt <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>relations</hi> and alienate ſuch who have ſometimes been moſt dear to other: no bond in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo ſtrait, which it will not break. It doth oft ſet the huſband againſt the wife, and the parents againſt the children; Yea, when <hi>religion</hi> once breaks out in a corner of a land, or a family, doth it not then make a viſible <hi>jar,</hi> and put all in a <hi>flame.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. It is clear, that when once <hi>grace</hi> appeareth in men, they are as a <hi>ſign</hi> and <hi>wonder</hi> to a profane gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. The World doth then ſenſibly change her countenance, and looketh like a ſtep-mother: while on other hand it is clear, that profeſſors turning <hi>looſe,</hi> and running to an <hi>exceſs of riot</hi> with others, will cauſe their old adverſaries to warm towards them; and alas, proveth the ſureſt way to gain men's <hi>friendſhip,</hi> while the World thinks, they are their own, when once they turn profane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>ELEVENTH. That the Creature is made ſubject to vanity, becauſe of ſin:</hi> which not only the wiſeſt of men, but the Spirit of God, doth witneſs, that things here beneath the ſun, are indeed <hi>vanity, and vexation of ſpirit, (Rom.</hi> 8. 20. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2. 11.) is a piece of the Scripture, in ſuch great letters written forth to the view of men, that none can be ſtrangers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="unknown:005185_0286_1016DC6FB4D91550"/>
It is true, the cauſe, and ſolid remedy of this ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral a complaint, are only reached by the <hi>Godly</hi> man; who knoweth how to read the vanity of the creature, as a piece of the fulfilling of the word, and doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider things as they are, and not as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. But it is alſo ſure, that in every age through the various changes of man's life this is ſo clearly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, that the moſt groſs and brutiſh cannot ſhift the conviction thereof: but in one of theſe two times have been forced to a publick acknowledging of the ſame; at <hi>death,</hi> when they are leaving the World, or in a day of <hi>ſtrait,</hi> when the World is leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.

               <p n="1">1. Have not the greateſt inſtances of the <hi>glory of the World,</hi> been uſually the greateſt examples of its <hi>vanity,</hi> and <hi>change?</hi> How few hath ambition raiſed, but it hath alſo ruined; yea, given the ſoreſt fall to thoſe it had lifted moſt high? What ſudden changes do attend great men, and high places; which thoſe who ſit low, do eſcape? Sure, if the tragedies of Princes, and ſuch who in their condition have been raiſed above others, were put by themſelves in record, it would make a great volumn, and ſhew how their <hi>glory</hi> and proſperous eſtate did only make their <hi>fall</hi> the more obſervable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it not obvious, what a <hi>frail dying diſpoſition</hi> is in all worldly things; that even the greateſt King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and politick bodies, to maintain which neither policy nor ſtrength was wanting, yet like natural bodies of men had their inevitable <hi>periods,</hi> their youth and flouriſhing times, their declining and old age, and at laſt been brought to their <hi>grave?</hi> Hath not the glory of greateſt Empires and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies ſunk in the duſt? yea, ſcarce a heap of ſtones left this day, to tell us where once famous cities have ſtood, <hi>Nun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

So that the morning hath ſeen ſome happy and flouriſhing in the World, whom the evening hath ſeen miſerable: and in a moſt ſhort time, ſuch who have been objects of envy and admiration, made the object of men's contempt and pity; yea, have ſo ſuddenly diſappeared, have ſunk into ſo little bounds, that men have been put narrowly to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and with admiration aſk, <hi>Are theſe they who were once a terrour in the land of the living!</hi> And their place hath not been found, who a few days before ſeemed to <hi>place themſelves alone in the midſt of the earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4.

Is there any thing ſo <hi>pleaſant,</hi> which hath not a <hi>worm</hi> at the root thereof, a <hi>moth</hi> which naturally breeds in the moſt ſatisfying enjoyments, that quickly eats out the heart thereof, and blaſts their hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the harveſt? How oft is greateſt longing, in the purſuit of things, turned to loathing and wearineſs, when obtained? becauſe it is not the nature of the thing, ſo much as an humour, and the novelty thereof,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:005185_0288_1016DC72A375C628"/>
that maketh them pleaſant. Hence many ſenſual men have turned Monaſtick, and greateſt. Monarchs become melancholy; yea, how uſual is it for many to ſurvive their pleaſures, and bury their joy and delights in the World, even before themſelves; while nothing remains of all their former enjoyments, but ſome ſad ſighs and groans with a heavy fare-well.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Is it not found that <hi>riches,</hi> and abundance of the earth doth <hi>load</hi> more than it fills, &amp; men's <hi>wealth</hi> only further heighten their <hi>wants?</hi> How very <hi>poor</hi> are ſome amidſt their <hi>fulneſs;</hi> more than thoſe who earn their bread with ſore labour; whom the world doth wholly poſſeſs, while they do not all poſſeſs it, neither is it in their power to make uſe of that they have. Yea, are they not ſick and dy in Princes courts, as well as in the meaneſt cottage, and the complaints of the great and rich uſually more than thoſe of the poor? Sure it is known, that the great man doth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner want a ſtomack and reſt, than the poor want meat and a bed to ly in.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In what an <hi>endleſs circle</hi> do <hi>voluptuous</hi> man move, from one thing to another; in a perpetual ſearch after other enjoyments, to ſatisfy their ſpirits?

What torment doth a ſmall ruffle and affront oft prove to the proud man, even in the midſt of his glory? is it not alſo found, how carnal mirth and joy of men wallowing in the delights of the World, hath ſtill in the cloſe a bitter ſting and harſh reflection, which as the ſhadow attends the body, is the native and unſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequent thereof.

                  <hi>TWELFTH.</hi> There is this truth, which hath in all ages been clearly witneſſed, even to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the World, <hi>that the end of the upright man is peace;</hi> and integrity, what ever rub it may ſeem to have by the way, yet hath a ſweet and comfortable cloſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 37.</p>
               <p>This is an undeniable truth, not only becauſe the ſaints are then entring into perfect peace: but it is alſo clear, that however the godly man may have very ſharp aſſaults in the cloſe of his days, and ſome who have ſhined very bright, do ſet in a dark cloud, their evening full of ſorrow and bitterneſs, yea, their reflection on ſome ſad ſlip, which they have made by the way, bearing them company even to the grave; yet this truth is ſtill verified, yea, may be deſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the conviction of the world, that integrity and an upright walk hath much peace in the end, and doth land men upon a comfortable harbour: as to which, I can appeal to the World, and the moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary obſervers, if this hath not been oft very convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſcernable to them; from many inſtances of the Lord's uſual way with thoſe who have been faithful in their generation, at their death; from that teſtimony which they have then given to this, yea, from moſt viſible ſigns and evidences hereof, even upon their countenance and carriage: whilſt it is ſeen,—</p>

1. How great an <hi>advantage</hi> ſuch uſe to have <hi>above others,</hi> when <hi>Death</hi> approacheth; ſo that it hath not been <hi>Balaam's</hi> wiſh alone, <hi>to die the death of the righteous, and to have his latter end like theirs,</hi> but the worſt of men are ſtill forced to witneſs their reſpect to the lot of a dying Chriſtian, and would wiſh a ſhare thereof when it comes to their turn; about which I may aſk the greateſt <hi>mockers</hi> at Religion and at the life of a Godly man, if they can poſſibly ſhun this conviction, that ſurely ſuch are at the beſt eſtate, and at the greateſt advantage, in their end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This I am ſure cannot be hid from the World, that <hi>abundant peace</hi> the ſaints do then teſtify in their <hi>choice;</hi> what a preſent unſpeakable <hi>complacency</hi> they have with this, that they valued <hi>Chriſt</hi> above all other advantages, did <hi>chuſe affliction rather than fin;</hi> and now while they are turning their face to the wall, find the witneſs of a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> and in God's approbation ſo ſweet a <hi>feaſt,</hi> that their joy and peace on this account, they can not ſmother or keep in, but declare to all who ſtand by, what they find. And truly it hath been oft ſeen, how the inward joy which ſome of theſe have had, hath exceeded their outward pain, been more ſenſible to them, than their ſickneſs; yea, they have been in leaving the World much more chearful than thoſe whom they left behind.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is alſo known, and may be very obvious to ſtanders by, how with a <hi>ſweet compoſure</hi> and <hi>recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bency of ſoul</hi> ſuch have laid themſelves upon the <hi>promiſe,</hi> in that hour, while they were grapling with the <hi>king of terrors;</hi> their ſpirit then quiet and calm, having taken the truth and teſtimony of God for their ſhield and buckler: which may tell the World what another kind of ſecurity and confidence theſe have beyond others; yea, that ſurely the the ground on which this confidence is founded,
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:005185_0293_1016DC2D95CF2910"/>
muſt be a thing that is able to bear out the greateſt ſtorm and aſſault, and is ſomething above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is it not clear, that even an <hi>untimely</hi> and <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> death could not hinder or fruſtrate that peace, which integrity cauſeth in the cloſe? For innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtances can witneſs what marvellous joy and ſatisfaction the Saints have ſhewed at a ſtake, and upon a ſcaffold; and thence have had more chearful going out of time, than the rich man ſtretched upon his ſoft bed, or the greateſt Monarch amidſt all outward advantages. Sure we muſt ſay, that ſweet refreſhing cloſe of the upright man hath never been more viſible, and writ in greater letters, than in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What very ſad <hi>conflicts</hi> have ſome of the Saints had in their <hi>life:</hi> yea, even upon the ſetting of the ſun have been put to cry out through fore perplexing <hi>fears,</hi> and <hi>doubts,</hi> wherewith they have been aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who have at laſt had this turned into a <hi>ſong,</hi> and ſuch a marvellous change in their caſe, as hath not been more ſenſible to themſelves, than diſcernable to all lookers on, like a ſudden calm and ſunſhine, after ſome dark ſtorm. I muſt here aſk the Atheiſt, and ſuch as reckon Godlineſs but a fancy, whence ſhould ſo ſtrange, ſo ſudden and great alteration proceed; that thoſe who a little before were under ſuch horror, could have no reſt, no arguments could ſerve their turn, do thus witneſs the abundant peace of their ſouls; yea, (which is oft ſeen) that <hi>fervent deſire,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome of the Saints are taken away, the very luſtre of heaven being upon their countenance! How mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous and piercing are their words, which may clearly tell that now they feel, they ſee, and have got ſome glance of that, which lookers on cannot reach, though they cannot deny an acknowledgment of this.</p>

                  <pb n="259" facs="unknown:005185_0294_1016DC7D1D4992E8"/>
6. Muſt not the World grant, yea, the greateſt enemies to godlineſs allow this charity, that ſure this <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> which ſuch have witneſſed at <hi>death,</hi> can be <hi>no counterfeit?</hi> That there is no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could thus byaſs them to deceive others, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in a matter of ſuch high concernment; and at a time, when it is expected, the groſſeſt of men would ſpeak truth; yea, that this doth appear, while men cannot in the leaſt charge dying Chriſtians, with any diſtemper in their judgment, but while they have been moſt compoſed, ſtayed, and preſent in mind, and as to other things of their concernment, moſt deliberate and ſober; even then they have born this witneſs.</p>
               <p>(¶) Since that peace and joy, which integrity hath in the cloſe of the day, when the Saints are dying, is undeniable, even to the conviction of the World, I would add ſomething about that great truth, <hi>The immortality of the ſoul, and its ſubſiſting after death:</hi> to which this joy, when the Chriſtian is finiſhing his courſe, hath a ſpecial reſpect; and is a truth, wherein the Scriptures accompliſhment, and the certainty of that bleſſed record, may be convincingly witneſſed, and demonſtrated to the World. For it is thus (I mean, by the light of the Scripture) that <hi>life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality is brought to light,</hi> and made known to the ſons of men. I know, this ſeems ſo common and uncontroverted a thing, an after-being of the ſoul, and its eternal ſubſiſtence, that to eſſay more than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of it may be looked on as impertinent. But oh, how <hi>unknown</hi> a truth is it! of which there needs no more to ſhew the little ſolid perſwaſion men have, but that it is ſo uſually paſſed with ſo <hi>few,</hi> and theſe very <hi>common thoughts.</hi> It is not indeed much queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, not becauſe it is believed and men are ſure thereof, but becauſe they are not in earneſt about ſuch a thing. It concerns the World to keep at a diſtance
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:005185_0295_1016DC31DC497C50"/>
from a thorough <hi>knowing</hi> of that which would be their <hi>torment</hi> to know; and there is cauſe for this ſad regret within the Church, that the moſt great and fundamental truths, wherein our comfort is moſt concern'd, are uſually leaſt ſtudied. But O ſhould it not put us to other thoughts, if we could have a ſerious view of this? It may truly be ſaid, the better part is ſo buried in the worſt part, that until men are dying, few <hi>lay this to heart,</hi> that their <hi>ſouls</hi> muſt live for ever, yea, muſt once part fellowſhip with the body, and enter in another World, and an unknown ſtate, until the reſurrection. What I intend here, is only a ſhort touch at this great truth, as it is a convincing witneſs to the Scripture, and the accompliſhment thereof; about which I would offer theſe three to be conſidered. 1. How expreſs and clear a teſtimony the Scripture gives to this. 2. On what plain and undeniable grounds of reaſon this truth is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the world. 3. How great a thing it is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and be aſſuredly perſwaded thereof: for it ſeems, men rather dream, than have their judgments ſeriouſly exerciſed, or are in earneſt about ſuch a thing.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> It is undeniable that not only the <hi>Scripture</hi> holds this forth, but that <hi>there only</hi> men have a clear and right diſcovery of it. It is indeed known, what glances the world hath had of this, yea, what hath been writ thereon, by ſome whoſe ſole guide was the light of nature, in this ſearch. But it is no leſs evident, how very dark and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, theſe have been: they could not ſhift ſome conviction thereof, but it was through a dark cloud, and as ſome pleaſant dream, they looked thereon; becauſe they did not know its riſe and original, and what the end was, to which in its actings it ought to be directed; they knew not what its after-condition could truly mean. Hence with ſuch wavering and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainly do they expreſs their thoughts. I do not
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:005185_0296_1016DC7EA88C5730"/>
here mean the ſchools of <hi>Epicurus</hi> only, to whom the ſoul was but a complexion of atoms; but ye ſee how perplexed and uncertain both <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of thoſe famous ancients have ſhew'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about this: which ſpeaks out more ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd and diſordered notion, which they could not ward off, than any clear and certain diſcovery which they had on ſolid grounds thereof; for they knew not the Scripture, where its original, whence it is and whither it muſt return, is ſo clearly held forth. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 7. And you may further ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 22, 23. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9</p>
               <p n="2">2. This grave teſtimony, which the Scripture of God do's bear to ſuch a truth, may be alſo held forth to the world from ſuch a <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>rational demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> that the moſt brutiſh of men can hardly ſink ſo far into the condition of a beaſt, as to deny they have a never-dying ſoul, which will not go to he duſt or inherit corruption with the body. I ſhould be loath to borrow ſo much of your time, by any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on a ſubject, which by others hath been ſo much handled; for which there are many, many arguments, unanſwerably demonſtrative of this truth, both Phyſical and Moral; yet having mentioned it, I cannot altogether paſs the ſame without a touch at ſome few, that may be moſt convincing and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. (1.) If you ſhould queſtion the being and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of the ſoul after death, you muſt alſo deny its <hi>frame;</hi> that it is a ſimple, immaterial and active ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which hath neither quantity nor parts, and is not compounded of any principles, and therefore can be reſolved to none.—(2.) Do but conſider, if the ſoul have <hi>no cauſe of corruption,</hi> and from to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries can ſuffer oppoſition, at the body do's, through the prevalency of heat or cold, how ſhould it then admit of a diſſolution with the body! For you know generation and corruption they are by contraries. And
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:005185_0297_1016DC362E0E19A0"/>
if you argue from any natural cauſe, it muſt ſurely be one of two, which makes the ſoul partake with the body in its decay and mouldering down; either a <hi>dependance on matter,</hi> as the ſoul of the beaſt hath, which is but a material form, or a <hi>conflict from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary qualities,</hi> which you know helps the bodies waſting and its fall: but I think, you would not ſo far contradict reaſon, as to alledge any of theſe concerning the ſoul of man.—(3.) Conſider, if by thoſe <hi>diſeaſes</hi> to which the body is ſubject, the ſoul is not reached, muſt it not alſo have a diſtinct exiſtence from it? And I am ſure, you muſt grant, the ſoul doth not directly ſuffer from any outward diſeaſes; but the body may be under expreſſible pain and anguiſh, when there is a ſweet calm and ſerenity within.—(4.) Does not this witneſs, that the ſoul lies not a dying with the body, nor falls with it, ſince it ſuffers no <hi>decreaſe,</hi> but is found ſtrong and vigorous in its actings, when the fleſh is brought low, &amp; on a viſible decay? Yea, is it not at the greateſt advantage in its exerciſe and diſcerning, the more ſeparate from the body, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things? Now it is ſure, that cannot be deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the ſoul in its being, which is ſo ſubſervient to it in its operation. I think, thoſe who ever obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the joy and peace of a dying Chriſtian, &amp; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent frame and compoſure of his ſoul, under a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and languiſhing body, through many diſeaſes, may clearly ſee this truth, and there read a lecture of the immortality of the ſoul.—(5.) Will you conſider, can the ſoul of man have a dependence on the body in its <hi>being,</hi> when it does no way depend thereon in its <hi>acting</hi> &amp; <hi>exerciſe?</hi> For it is ſure, it does truly act, yea hath a clear ratiocination, even when the body ſleeps: and O does it not prove, that this ſoul that is found waking, when the other is aſleep, muſt have a diſtinct ſubſiſtence, and live when that dies. (6.) If you admit that there are <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>incorporeal</hi> beings, which
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:005185_0298_1016DC81AA7B07D0"/>
do act without a body, and yet have a true and real ſubſiſtence, can you doubt or queſtion the exiſting of the ſoul, or its exerciſing the faculties thereof, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the body, though you do not reach how this ſhould be? And if there be indeed a converſe &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe betwixt us and Spiritual beings, yea, a truth in fellowſhip with God the Father of Spirits, O may not this ſatisfyingly demonſtrate that exiſtence and acting of the ſoul; even when the body is at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and in the grave!—(7.) Conſider, that which you muſt grant hath a <hi>dominon</hi> and praeminence over the <hi>body;</hi> by its making a rational choice of good when it is moſt croſs to the deſire and delight of the fleſh; yea can not only determine it to endure moſt grievous torments, but does oft witneſs a ſpecial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation therein, muſt it not be ſomething truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the body, and what can have a ſubſiſtence without it? Now this, I am ſure, you will not deny, that there is ſuch a dominion over the fleſh, and a captiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it to the law of the mind; which the moſt ſenſual and brutiſh will not deny in many inſtances, how little acquaintance ſoever they have with it themſelves.—(8.) Since there is a diſcovery and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things, not only <hi>above</hi> the reach and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> but even <hi>contrary</hi> thereto, that men do rationally judge and aſſent to truths, which truly contradicts their ſenſes, as the rotundity of the earth, which ſems to us a plain, &amp;c. O does it not ſhew, that this ſoul in man, which can ſo far ſoar above the earth, and does ſo far exceed the body, muſt be of a more excellent mould, and ſomething truly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from it? I ſhall but add, what means that <hi>war</hi> and <hi>ſtrugling</hi> which to every Chriſtian is known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Spirit;</hi> yea, to every man is known betwixt <hi>him</hi> and his natural <hi>conſcience?</hi> what mean thoſe <hi>reflex</hi> acts of the ſoul on its ſelf, thoſe marvellous products of the underſtanding, and
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:005185_0299_1016DCC16AE162F0"/>
                  <hi>new diſcovery?</hi> why are men ſo anxious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about their ſurviving <hi>name,</hi> which is a moſt poor airy accident, not worth the regarding, if there were a deſtruction of the whole? what means that marvellous deportment of ſo many <hi>martyrs</hi> for the truth, that they ſhould ſhew ſuch a joy &amp; ſatisfaction amidſt their torments, as though they had no bodies; the pleaſure of the ſoul ſo far overcoming the pain of the fleſh? what means ſo <hi>univerſal</hi> a <hi>conſent</hi> to this truth, that thoſe who hate and fear it, yet cannot be rid thereof? &amp; I muſt alſo aſk, how are the <hi>choice</hi> and the <hi>excellent</hi> of the earth ſo oft cruſh'd under the feet of their <hi>oppreſſors,</hi> whilſt theſe wretches do oft wallow in all ſatisfying outward delights; yea, ſometimes go hence <hi>without bands in their death?</hi> In a word, O what is it that makes ſo vaſt a <hi>difference</hi> betwixt <hi>men</hi> and <hi>beaſts,</hi> ſince theſe you ſee have a ſenſual life, want not ſome natural ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and have their enjoyments by the ſenſes as well as man?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let us conſider how <hi>great</hi> and <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi> a truth this is. O <hi>immortality,</hi> do men believe it (the ſoul's ſurviving the body, and that condition wherein it will enter) and yet have ſo <hi>few thoughts</hi> thereof! For this is a matter of ſuch concernment, that may turn much of our life in a continued wondering. I muſt ſay, can this be believed, our having an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſoul, which is of a more excellent nature and ineſtimable value, than theſe viſible heavens, ſun, moon and ſtars; and which no leſs than the blood of him who was truly God, could ranſom from everlaſting wrath, &amp; yet that we put ſo ſmall a price thereon! Is it indeed believed by men, whilſt they are ſo hot in their purſuit after the world; ſince here is a queſtion may ſilence all fleſh, <hi>What ſhould it avail a man to gain</hi> were it <hi>the whole world,</hi> when it is purchaſed with the <hi>loſing of the ſoul?</hi> It is ſure, there is no imaginable
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:005185_0300_1016DC83C4D52EC0"/>
proportion betwixt that and a piece of red earth, or betwixt a few years of time and long eternity. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member a paſſage of worthy <hi>Mr. Blair,</hi> our own country man, who the firſt time he heard <hi>Mr. Bruce</hi> preach, ſaid, The ſame of ſo great a man cauſed him to expect ſomething very extraordinary from him; but his whole Sermon did preſs this truth of the ſoul's being immortal, and that it was a great thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it; he confeſſed, it did at firſt ſome way amuſe him, why he dwelt ſo much upon ſo known and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a ſubject: but after, he found it was ſome other thing than appears at the firſt look; for which men may diſpute, and toſs it as a notion in the ſchools, who never knew what it was to believe the truth thereof; and that a ſerious impreſſion of it on the heart is ſomething elſe than a ſwiming of it in the head, by ſome ordinary ſpeculation of this. O what a truth would it appear, and what aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment would it cauſe, if men would but ſome times go alone, and conſider,—(1.) What it is they have thus held out to them, and how <hi>great a change</hi> is before them which ere many days muſt be in their condition, when once that ſtrange ſtep is paſſed, betwixt time and another world, which they can ſtep but once.—(2.) That this marvellous change is truly <hi>near;</hi> time making long ſteps, the veſſel under full ſail, which carries men forward, whether they ſleep or wake, to that port: for it is ſure, this cannot be long deferred, and it is very unſure, but this night thy ſoul may be required.—(3.) That this change muſt be <hi>in a moment,</hi> in the very twinkling of an eye, and no interval, but a preſent entering of the ſoul into that <hi>after-ſtate,</hi> which ſhall then put the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in the fulneſs of an inconceivable joy, in the immediate preſence of God, in the embracements of the Mediator, amongſt the angels, and ſpirits of the juſt made perfect; but one moment alſo muſt put <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>

Oh! if men would conſider, what <hi>thoughts</hi> they ſhall <hi>then</hi> have in another world, <hi>of that other world,</hi> and what other thoughts of their <hi>former</hi> ſtate and condition; how far they will find this beyond all they ever thought or conceived at a diſtance.—(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now to ſhut up this argument, I ſhall offer one inſtance more, wherein the world may ſee the truth of the Scripture, and therewith of a divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, convincingly demonſtrated, if prejudice did not draw a vail and obſtruct ſo excellent a diſcovery: it is this, <hi>That the way of God is perfect</hi> (Pſal. 18. 30.) <hi>and that his works are perfect; and his ways, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> (Deut. 32. 4.) yea, <hi>that he do's all things well</hi> (Mark. 7. 37.) which teſtimony then the <hi>multitude</hi> was forced to bear to this great truth: And O how great a truth is it! which can be ſaid neither of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels nor men, but to Him hath a peculiar reſpect, even to him alone, in whoſe way there is nothing crooked, no miſtake, no inequality, nothing too much or ſuperfluous, nothing out of due time, that is either too ſoon, or too late, nothing incongruous,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:005185_0302_1016DC8C86161330"/>
nothing miſplaced; yea, in all he do's nothing which is not beſt done, which any could rectify or make better, but in every piece of his work leaves matter of wonder behind, and thus declares himſelf to be God! I know, this is a truth the World cannot well bear, but pretends a viſible contradiction from the great <hi>diſorder,</hi> that things here ſeem to be in; for men will oppoſe to this, what a miſcarrying there is of inſtruments, what a ſtrange emergency there is of moſt grievous and croſs accidents, the moſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing means frequently blaſted; yea, how good and evil are ſo ſtrangely interweaved; and is not the preſent day oft undoing the work and labour of the former? Yet whatever the World can ſay to darken this great truth, <hi>That the way of the Lord is abſolutely perfect,</hi> it muſt ſhine: yea, it do's not want clearneſs, when by a thick interpoſition betwixt us and the ſame, there may be need of clearing it. The ſun ceaſes not to ſhine, when the clouds obſtruct its brightneſs, as to us. O that thoſe who will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>I ſhall touch a little this demonſtration, how this piece of divine truth is verified and writ out in the event, to the obſervation of the World, that they who cannot ſpiritually diſcern the ſame, yet have ſo much witneſſed is to dazle their eyes, and force this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, that <hi>the way of the Lord is perfect,</hi> and <hi>he hath done all things well!</hi> and for clearing, I would offer ſome particulars, though few, yet ſo very comprehenſive, that in a large meaſure they reach not only th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> you may ſee this clearly verified, that <hi>the way of the Lord is perfect, in the whole frame and ſtructure of the Church of Chriſt here;</hi> which is made a great wonder, and an aſtoniſhing piece of the work of God, beyond the moſt exquiſite humane contrivance, that ever was. It is true, <hi>her glory,</hi> that do's moſt affect the eye, and raviſh the heart, it is <hi>within,</hi> and lies not in the common road of men's obſervation: yea, ſome parts of this excellent body oftimes are in ſuch a diſorder, as darkens the beauty of the whole; there is ſuch an intermixture of the <hi>hay and ſtubble</hi> of humane inventions, with this choiſe building, that helps to mar its order and beauty; the carved work alſo may be ſpoil'd and broken down, as with axes and hammers; yet with all theſe diſadvantages, there is a glory on the Church of Chriſt, an awful Majeſty, ſuch convincing marks of its grandeur, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven under its ruins, as have forc't the World, and the great men thereof, to conſider that ſight with wonder and amazement, which you ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48. <hi>they ſaw, they marvelled, and haſted away.</hi> And the preceeding words give clear reaſon, <hi>for God was known in her palaces for a refuge.</hi> They ſaw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing both in the grandeur and frame of the Church, and in her preſervation, that forc't them to ſee that it was ſomething more than humane. Now to clear this a little, do but conſider theſe few inſtances, wherein you may ſee the great and ſtupendious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the Church, and how all things are there well ordered by him who hath framed it.—(1.) You may ſee on what a <hi>ſure foundation</hi> it is built, even that <hi>of the Prophets and Apoſtles</hi> which is the Scripture of God, whereon as it is manifeſtly found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:005185_0304_1016DC91804F48E0"/>
it is no leſs marvellouſly <hi>united</hi> and <hi>joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>chief corner-ſtone:</hi> will you ſeriouſly conſider the <hi>form</hi> of the houſe, and the <hi>faſhion</hi> thereof, its <hi> goings out</hi> and <hi>comings in,</hi> with all its ordinances, and there you may ſee how marvellouſly exact and uniform this building is. (2.) Is it not likewiſe obvious, that the Church, thus <hi>fitly joined together and knit, by all that the joynts do ſupply,</hi> in its whole complex frame <hi>groweth up as a building to the Lord?</hi> Yea, is there not a very ſtrait union and correſpondence betwixt all the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the ſame faith and worſhip; that tho' divided in ſo many parcels through the World, yet is ſtill one intire body, the union whereof, the variety of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and theſe of ſuch various ſizes, that great inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity amongſt them in their growth, the remoteneſs of place, different languages, exile or change of countries, yet cannot break off that near tie, that joins the Church of Chriſt together.—(3.) What a wonderful contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is it, which is <hi>in</hi> the World, yet not <hi>of</hi> it? that ſpreads itſelf among the Nations, yet loſeth not its own diſtinct being; is mixed with humane ſocieties, yet an incloſure and incorporation by her ſelf; a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſweet waters ſealed, though ſurrounded with this great ſalt Ocean of the world; is made up of many particular Churches, yet every part homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of the ſame nature with the whole; and though it ſeems to be open to ſore aſſaults, yet is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenced city, which is impaled, hath both her walls and watchmen, her bulwarks and ſtrong towers! (4) This is of ſuch a frame, that is both <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>inviſible,</hi> yet <hi>not two diſtinct</hi> Churches; though, under diverſe conſiderations, it comprehends both without any jar, and hath communion with Jeſus Chriſt as her head for life; ſtanding related to him as his myſtical body, and yet as a viſible politick body, is related alſo to him, as its ſupreme head, by a political go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

and guidance, and hath an expreſs charter granted for its extents and rights.—(5.) This muſt be ſaid of it, <hi>though black, yet comely;</hi> though it does not want ſome <hi>ſpots</hi> they do not ſo far mar its beauty, but, that in all its ſeveral adminiſtrations there appears a ſingular grace. It hath indeed its blemiſhes and failings, yet every meaſure and degree thereof does not forfeit her relation, rights, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.—(6.) Is it not a marvellous frame, which does not want a corrupt mixture, yet in its <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> does <hi>allow</hi> no corruption; and though many are found groſs within, yet does it difference betwixt the <hi>precious</hi> and the <hi>vile;</hi> yea, ſhuts its gates, as well as it opens, and is no more tender and eaſy in her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, then awful and authoritative in her rejection?—(7) Its ſo well conſtituted, that all her <hi>officers</hi> have their appointment, and each their work and charge deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet no greater <hi>variety</hi> of ſervice and imployments, than there is of gifts, which from her head are diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſuted to the ſame.—(8.) She is of ſuch a mould and frame, that though ſhe can boaſt of an <hi>intrinſick power,</hi> within her ſelf, yet muſt derive it from <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> fountain; yea, muſt have a <hi>directory</hi> and rule from her ſupreme <hi>head</hi> and lawgiver, for exerting the <hi>acts</hi> of that power: which alſo hath its proper <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> even the inward man, and its peculiar <hi>end,</hi> the edification of the body, to which this power and the exerciſe thereof is directed.—(9.) This is ſuch a body, the members whereof are indeed ſubject to the <hi>magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,</hi> and denies no due obedience to that power, yet without any ſubordination or ſubjecting of the <hi>Church,</hi> as ſuch, to an humane power: and though it hath not its authority or juriſdiction from men, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies no juſt reſpect to theſe: it does <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>looſe</hi> upon the earth, which no humane power can make void; and though caſt in among the nations, yet by peculiar bounds is kept from all other ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:005185_0306_1016DC974EE51088"/>
diſtinct: ſhe hath her judicatories, and there a ſubordination of the leſſer to the greater, yet no allowed preeminence and inequality amongſt her officers: yea, though her government is trnly <hi>monarchick</hi> with reſpect to her head, for there is but one ſupreme Lord; yet with reſpect to the ſervants and officers, it is a moſt excellent well tempered <hi>ariſtocracy,</hi> which holds off thoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual differences of power and greatneſs amongſt them, which are ſo much in uſe amongſt the nations. In a word, O do you conſider this choice and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite frame, and you will ſee how both <hi>tenderneſs</hi> and <hi>ſeverity</hi> do here concur; what a healing there is here in her ſharpeſt rebukes and cenſures, whilſt a private eſſay for gaining, is to go before a publick and judicial procedure; yea, her authoritative deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations without prejudice to the judgment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian prudence and diſcretion, which belongs to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of her members. Conſider alſo how ſhe <hi>wears not out,</hi> but hath ſtill a ſpring after the winter, hath both her ſigns and her ſeaſons, and whilſt ſhe is lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and in a decay as to particular members, ſhe is ſtill <hi>travailing in birth</hi> for a new off-ſpring and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. O that they who ſtand afar, would but come near, and ſeriouſly look on this rare piece of work! <hi>Go about Zion, conſider well her towers and bulwarks,</hi> &amp;c. that you may ſee, this is a fabrick the Lord hath founded, &amp; raiſed up, &amp; that ſurely this piece of the word is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in fulfilled, <hi>His way is perfect, &amp; he does all things well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is not this great truth clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, not only in the frame, but in the whole <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and adminiſtration of providence about the Church?</hi> Which is indeed one of the moſt marvellous diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we have of God here; yea, even to the world, is oft convincingly obvious, through what a varietie of diſpenſations he uſeth to bring forth his work, and makes his way oft break out of the boſome of a
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:005185_0307_1016DC98EB727F60"/>
dark cloud; yea, ſo unexpectedly can make thoſe perplexed changes, with which the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is toſſed, reſolve in ſuch a ſatisfying cloſe, that it may be ſeen they were all directed for her intereſt and advantage. I know, this is a great deep, and we cannot have ſuch a diſcovery of the providence of God about the Church, nor reach the meaning of things in their firſt mould, as in their after-tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and product. O that marvellous ſight, which ſhall once be, when that great work of providence, that now is put over into the hand of the Mediator, hath its perfect cloſe; and the whole frame and contexture ſet up together as one entire piece to look upon, that is now by ſeveral pieces and through a various ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ages carried on! Yet we muſt ſay, the Lord herein comes ſo near, even in the darkeſt times, and makes the glory of this truth in ſuch a meaſure ſhine forth, as may convincingly witneſs to any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervers, the way of the Lord is <hi>perfect</hi> in all that he does. I ſhall here offer ſome few things, that in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time are obvious to thoſe who take pleaſure in ſuch a diſcovery, and deſire not to keep at a diſtance therewith. (1.) Muſt it not be ſaid of his way, that <hi>he does nothing in vain,</hi> but makes all things <hi>congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his end,</hi> even things that amongſt themſelves do moſt croſs one another? Does he not carry on his deſign by the miſcarrying of inſtruments, and bring forth his greateſt works by means moſt ſmall and contemptible? I know, the world would object, they can ſee no ſuch thing; and indeed providence cannot be underſtood, or the meaning thereof by one look: but I muſt aſk, do you diſcern the motion of the hand upon the clock, even whilſt it is certainly going forward? yet when it comes to the hour, and ſtrikes, you will ſee it was then moving. It is ſure, there are ſuch periods, that providence hath, where its meaning does not clearly break forth, until
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:005185_0308_1016DC9A8ECB71F0"/>

all the ſteps thereof, &amp; after-product; would ſeem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant; yet no real jar. For the Church ſinking, yet do's not periſh; in a flame, yet not conſumed, but is thereby kept alive; brought under the yoke of the oppreſſor, to make her grow and flouriſh; is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſmitten, for her further healing, and a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God's tenderneſs to her thereby; hath a greater weight and burden put on, to give her thus eaſe and enlargement; yea, is chaſtned and meets with ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to prevent ſuffering, <hi>that ſhe may reſt in the day of trouble!</hi> Sure theſe are <hi>a part of the ways of God,</hi> and may be viſibly demonſtrated in the conduct of his providence about the Church, even to the conviction of the world. But oh! it is hard to ſee, when men will ſhut their eyes.—(5.) Is it not obvious, what ſtrange things do ſometime fall in <hi>betwixt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and cloſe</hi> of ſome ſpecial piece of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about the Church, that do paſs humane reach to give a preſent reaſon for the ſame: yet in all theſe may there not be diſcerned a remarkable <hi>dependance</hi> and <hi>connection</hi> of things? how in ſuch a variety of croſs events, and in a long continued tract of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, every thing falls in aright, in its own place; yea, every ſtep, every circumſtance, ſo proportioned by a marvellous diſpoſal and conduct thereof, to ſute another, for making the whole complex pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence beautiful; that on a ſerious review the world muſt confeſs, this is a concatenation ſo ſtrange, that it muſt be his work, &amp; his alone, who <hi>ſees things from the beginning to the end!</hi> (6.) How perfect is his way, who can <hi>haſten</hi> and <hi>diſpatch</hi> his work by <hi>delays;</hi> and when he ſeems to take a long circuit in bringing about his deſign, yet loſes no time, but in ſuch a viſible going back do's moſt effectually move for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward! Yea, is it not ſeen, how he makes things fall in, that are very <hi>unexpected, croſs</hi> and <hi>remote</hi> (that would never have entred in our thoughts) to

                  <hi>anſwer</hi> his bleſſed end? and even diſpoſe that which above all might ſeem moſt directly <hi>deſtructive</hi> to the Church, to be of all other things moſt effectual and ſubſervient to her <hi>advance;</hi> brings her more quickly forward to the harbor by a ſtorm, than a calm! O have we not ſuch great things to obſerve in the way of the Lord, that may ſhew it is indeed perfect!—(7.) It is alſo very clear, though not on the firſt view, yet in the cloſe and iſſue, what a <hi>certain ſteady motion</hi> providence hath, and keeps on its courſe, whilſt the World is reeling to and fro: how the Church's mercy hath by greateſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments been more fully anſwered, than in the moſt probable way; yea, when her relief ſeem'd furtheſt off, and had been much followed with many a weary look from ſome other quarter, with what a ſtrange ſurpriſal do's providence oft break out at her hand, as it were from under the ground, with an unexpected mercy?—(8.) You may ſee his way is perfect, who puts a <hi>peculiar beauty</hi> upon every occurrent of providence, and brings it forth in the very <hi>fit opportune time,</hi> that it could not fall out more ſeaſonably and with more advantage to the Church. Is there not a ſeen cauſe for her ſharp trials, and the neceſſity thereof no leſs diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, than there is of the winter, for the profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the earth? and is it not alſo manifeſt, her reviving came never too late, but in the very fitteſt time? I know, the World may object, they can ſee this in the revolutions of the <hi>Year,</hi> but not in any ſuch changes of the <hi>Church:</hi> yet I am ſure, this is manifeſt, that the Church of Chriſt hath her <hi>ſad</hi> and her more <hi>comforting</hi> times here, with as deſcernable a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of the one to the other, as there is of the Summer to the Winter; yea, that under theſe <hi>viciſſitudes</hi> of her condition ſhe is ſtill ſeen to look forth with a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>advantage.</hi> I ſhall add; what a mavellous <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi>

and <hi>temperament</hi> of <hi>contraries</hi> is diſcernable in this excellent frame of providence? There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here incongruous; nothing here too ſmall, which doth not fall under its reach, and nothing ſo great that can over-reach it; here is no jar or diſagreeing with the diligent uſe of means, yet does this riſe ſo far above the ſame, that no human care can bend it to their will, nor is there any running croſs to ſuch a current. Here is indeed an unſearchable deep! Yet ſo much is there broken forth and made clear, that may convincingly witneſs and verify this truth, even to ordinary obſervers, <hi>the way of the Lord is perfect.</hi> And what now we cannot attain in its diſcovery we ſhould learn to admire and ſolidly believe a more clear mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation thereof.</p>

This is indeed far above nature, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a divine illumination it cannot be known, or underſtood: yet we muſt ſay, ſo much is brought forth and diſcovered, that thoſe who have only report, and thence give ſome ordinary aſſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, cannot have their reaſon and judgment in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe without ſome ſuch conviction upon their ſouls, that ſurely this is a contrivance above humane teach, and worthy of the great God; yea, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>his way is</hi> moſt abſolutely <hi>perfect:</hi> and no ſight can be like this, where we may ſee ſo excellent a correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence

between the foundation and ſuperſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the whole tract of the Goſpel is but one intire and compleat mean for glorifying God, and does in this as the ultimate end reſolve.

It is on this bleſſed contrivance we may ſee men brought under a conſtraint by irreſiſtible grace, yet without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; their reaſon further raiſed and refined, yet not broken, and its true liberty not taken away, but reſtored; yea, a notable conſiſtency betwixt moral perſwaſive arguments and the efficacious power of grace; betwixt men's planting and watering in the uſe of means, and the alone increaſe thereof from the Lord; betwixt a phyſical and moral concurrence in producing one and the ſame effect; betwixt thoſe two deſires in prayer, <hi>Da</hi> (<hi>Domine</hi>) <hi>quod jubes, et jube quod vis.</hi> Is there not likewiſe here a moſt excellent ſutableneſs and congruity, betwixt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſins, without prejudice to the freedom of grace; ſince he gives repentance, as well as requires it, and makes his people what he would have them to be!

How manifold is the uſe of the <hi>air,</hi> which fills up that vaſt ſpace betwixt the heavens and earth, and is ſo fit a medium for correſpondence betwixt the higher and lower world?

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> particularly to this argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though the Scripture is thus wonderfully ſuited by the Lord, and taketh place in <hi>every</hi> generation, as if it were alone directed to <hi>that</hi> time; yet it is alſo clear, that a <hi>ſpecial part</hi> thereof hath its <hi>proper accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment</hi> in thoſe ages and periods of time, to which it doth in a <hi>peculiar</hi> way relate: ſome part of it, which did concern the times of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> ſome that doth alſo anſwer to the times of the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi> and a part of it which hath a peculiar reſpect to theſe latter days, which the Lord is now bringing forth, and we wait for a more full accompliſhment, that it is on a near approach.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo ſure, that the <hi>whole work</hi> of God, and <hi>his</hi> providence about his Church here in the World, which was perfect from the beginning, and before him from eternity, is comprehended under the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>word;</hi> where the Lord hath fully revealed his mind and counſel about every event and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; though we oft be in the dark, in finding out the ſame, but the event will in due time ſpeak for it ſelf, which ſhould cauſe us until then
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:005185_0323_1016DCC89AEBFF90"/>
with much ſobriety to paſs our judgment on ſome of thoſe truths, that are not yet fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is clear, that the Prophets of old did not only foretel ſuch great changes and revolutions, as were to go over the Church's head, and declare the certainty thereof, but we find theſe prophecies oft point at the <hi>times</hi> and <hi>periods of time,</hi> whereto they did relate; and though ſometimes in dark terms, yet did clearly ſhew that there was a certain prefixed time, and not at every time could they have their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We ſhould conſider how the full <hi>accompliſhing</hi> of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>perfecting</hi> the Lord's <hi>work</hi> about his Church, will be at once, and doth keep pace together, and then ſhall a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>ſatisfying diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery</hi> of God's way and providence and all that he hath been doing in the World, clearly break forth, when the <hi>great myſtery of God</hi> in his written <hi>word</hi> is <hi>finiſhed,</hi> and the Church ſo near to land.</p>
               <p>That I may ſpeak a little to ſo grave a ſubject, I would lay down theſe two things to be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>How much</hi> of the Scripture, and predictions thereof, may be <hi>now</hi> ſeen clearly <hi>verified</hi> in the event.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What doth yet <hi>remain</hi> to have an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe laſt times; by which we may certainly judge, how near the Lord's work about his Church is to a <hi>cloſe.</hi> Under the firſt I ſhall point at ſome of thoſe moſt concerning events and changes, which the Church hath met with, wherein we may ſee what of the Scripture may at this day be read in the hiſtory of providence, and is certainly fulfilled.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> thing to be conſidered, is,—WHAT IS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED.</p>
               <p>I. Let us go back to thoſe firſt times after the fall; and ſee <hi>that dreadful ſtroke, which came upon the old
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:005185_0324_1016DCCD30FCE8A8"/>
World by the flood, after an univerſal defection from God,</hi> and we ſhall there find the fulfilling of that which <hi>Noah,</hi> that great <hi>Preacher of righteouſneſs,</hi> had oft fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, and of thoſe threatnings which by <hi>Moſes</hi> were there recorded: Wherein it may be very manifeſt, (1.) That this truth, beſides Divine authority, no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of ancient Times</hi> (no antiquity) could ever <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict;</hi> yea, ſome of the eldeſt writers do clearly <hi>witneſs</hi> ſomething of an univerſal <hi>deluge</hi> over the earth, with the ſtrange <hi>preſervation</hi> of ſome from it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were in the dark as to many circumſtances of it. <hi>Joſephus</hi> doth cite <hi>Beroſus</hi> the Caldears about this, who without doubt had then ſome of thoſe oldeſt records true and uncorrupt. <hi>Euſebius</hi> alſo doth mention ſome fragments of <hi>Abidenus,</hi> and <hi>App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>idorus,</hi> which in his time were extant, clearly pointing at the flood, and at <hi>Noah</hi> under the name of <hi>Ziuthrus,</hi> with his ſending out of birds to ſee if the waters were aſſwaged.—(2.) There is nothing here doth contradict <hi>reaſon,</hi> how this might be brought about, even in the way of ordinary natural cauſes, which the Lord did make uſe of for that end. For we find, <hi>the windows of Heaven were opened,</hi> the air being condenſed into clouds, and their retentive power looſed, theſe great floodgates were thus ſet open; which falling not in drops, but all in a full bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, like the ſpouts and cataracts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> might ſoon overwhelm, the earth with abundance of water; while thoſe <hi>fountains alſo of the great deep</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath were broken up, which was not only the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean let forth to go over its banks, but an univerſal vent to all the veins of the earth, and that great maſs of waters which is in the bowels thereof, which from beneath meeting thoſe that were from above, may give men a clear and rational account how ſuch a thing might be.—(3.) This piece of the Scripture is moſt <hi>congruous</hi> and agreable to the <hi>whole,</hi> and the
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:005185_0325_1016DCD15B2DE6A8"/>
great <hi>ſcope</hi> and <hi>drift</hi> of the ſame. For it points out an <hi>univerſal defection,</hi> and an <hi>univerſal ſtroke</hi> meeting together: it leads us forward to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of whom the <hi>ark</hi> was an excellent ſhadow, and of that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which in and by him the Church hath from eternal wrath: and is a very manifeſt pledge and ſign of that <hi>laſt deſtruction</hi> of the World, which though not in that manner, yet ſhall once ſurely be, and find men in ſuch a condition, as this flood found them into in the days of <hi>Noah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(¶) II. What we find expreſly threatned by the Lord (<hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 7.) as a ſtroke and judgment upon men for their ambition and pride, <hi>The confounding of their languages,</hi> is it not alſo moſt clearly verified and writ forth to the view of the world in the event? that whilſt men cannot deny or debate a thing which is ſo conſpicuous and undeniable, they muſt alſo ſee a fulfilling of the Scripture, and that there was a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine hand in this ſtrange ſtroke; which may be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing refutation of Atheiſm, if ſuch do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſhut their eyes at theſe clear evidences.—(1.) That it is ſure, there is ſuch a <hi>confuſion</hi> and variety of <hi>languages</hi> in the earth <hi>at this day;</hi> whence it is <hi>divided,</hi> one part thereof ſo much rent from another, commerce and correſpondence thus made difficult, and a bar drawn betwixt nations, by a different ſpeech. And do not the moſt ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the world witneſs the ſame to have been in <hi>former</hi> ages?—(2.) It is alſo ſure, that <hi>no tradition</hi> or humane hiſtory, but the Scripture only, gives us an <hi>account</hi> of this ſtrange thing how it ſhould be, or whence its true riſe is; yea, thoſe who have writ moſt of other things, yet can give no reaſon why they write in one language more than in another, but that it is proper to their country, where they had their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation. But how the race of men, who have ſuch
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:005185_0326_1016DCD2F135ABE8"/>
a community in other things, ſhould be thus divided, is indeed a myſtery, which divine truth can only unvail and ſhew its meaning.—(3.) It is ſure, there is no lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage one more than another, that is <hi>natural</hi> to men, but what <hi>ex inſtitutio</hi> is acquired, whether by long continued <hi>uſe</hi> as children doth their mother tongue, or by ſet rules. It is true, <hi>Adam</hi> who was the firſt man, had his by ſome extraordinary infuſion: but it is found a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful fancy alledged by ſome, that young children, who have never heard ſpeech, and have been thus kept at a diſtance, would ſpeak the firſt language of the world, and conſequently <hi>Hebrew;</hi> for the contrary of this is certainly prov'd.—(4.) Is not this <hi>confuſion</hi> and diverſity of languages, which is in the world, a <hi>moſt ſtrange</hi> and <hi>marvellous</hi> thing, which in no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, yea not without ſomething of a miracle, could be brought about, and to no continuance of time or invention of men can be attributed, if we conſider theſe things.—(1.) It is clear, that if man can be traced back to ſome <hi>original</hi> and beginning, there muſt then have been ſome <hi>one</hi> language, whilſt the world was but in a family; ſo that if you will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the truth of the creation, you may ſee it was not ſo at the beginning.—(2.) Is it not undeniable, that men could not <hi>chuſe</hi> ſo great a plague and judgment on themſelves, if they had any uſe of reaſon? which would divide betwixt them and the greater part of mankind, hinder trade and mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with other countrys, either in exporting or importing moſt neceſſary commodities; that which alſo would obſtruct humane knowledge, and the diſcovery of thoſe excellent inventions and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of other places; yea, give man, whoſe days are ſo few, ſuch a ſore toyl and labour to acquire but a few of thoſe many different languages, which are in the world.—(3.) Is it not alſo clear, that this is above human reach, which men cannot judge, <hi>how</hi> in an
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:005185_0327_1016DCD4E74D2458"/>
ordinary way ſuch <hi>different</hi> languages could have been <hi>found out,</hi> and afterwards acquired by the body of nations, yea, how there ſhould be ſuch an <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in this amongſt a vaſt multitude of different tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and capacities. For it is obvious, there ſhould have then been an inventing of thoſe firſt radical langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; I mean theſe that are not dependant upon, or interwoven one with another, but are wholly diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> &amp;c: And therewith ſuch a vaſt <hi>Dictionary,</hi> of words with their ſignifications, and rules to enjoin them in ſentences, muſt have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily been framed, and abandoning alſo and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning off of ſome former language, ſo far as to the bringing of it in oblivion: yea, would the univerſal conſent and concurrence of the multitude in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be required? I confeſs, this were not ſo ſtrange, if ſuch a difference betwixt Languages were but in ſome peculiar mode or propriety of phraſes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of words according to the various tempers, and climates of the earth: but we may ſee what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent languages there are, wholly independant on one another, not only in original words, but in the very whole frame and bulk, which can be no compound of other languages, as many of our modern tongues are, which does truly ſtate the caſe in ſuch a manner, that the Scripture only can reſolve how this ſhould be; yea, it is known, beſides many branches, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures and variations of languages, which through continuance of time, thro' conqueſt and mingling of nations together, are in the World, there is alſo a vaſt number of thoſe that may be on cleareſt ground judged <hi>original</hi> and <hi>mother-tongues,</hi> of which (whatever leſſer variation there hath been by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſome new words, or the quitting of old, yet the whole bulk does remain intire.—(4) What a ſtrange and marvellous thing m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt this be, if we conſider that moſt of <hi>ancient</hi> maternal languages were <hi>previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="unknown:005185_0328_1016DCD7B1AF1208"/>
to the uſe of <hi>letters,</hi> whence rules or a method could be conveyed from one to another, if it had been only ſome humane invention? For we may know from ſureſt antiquity, how long it was ere ſeveral na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reached a further way to communicate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and repreſent their conceptions, than by ſpeech and a vocal tradition, or ſome ſignificant ſymbols or Hieroglyphicks, which were then much in uſe to ſupply the want of letters. Is it not know how little either by pen or printing hath been diſcovered to the World, but of ſuch late time, as is from cleareſt hiſtories written to us? Thence we find very little of the <hi>Greek</hi> language upon record before <hi>Homer's</hi> time. Now may not this clearly demonſtrate, that in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way theſe languages could not then have been acquired?—(5) It may be very convincing, what the Scripture about this holds forth, that by theſe <hi>different</hi> languages, nations and families were at firſt <hi>divided. Genes.</hi> 11. yea, that this was the firſt riſe of bounding one of them from another, for which the World could never give another cauſe. Thus did the Lord incloſe his Church in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and by this diverſity of languages did out-law the reſt of the earth; for <hi>there</hi> was that venerable firſt language of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> kept up, by which theſe ſacred oracles of the Old Teſtament were made known. I ſhall further add. Is not a divine hand eminently ſeen in this? that ſo great a bar, which for ſo long a time was betwixt the Church and the world, ſhould not only at laſt be taken off, but ſuch a <hi>curſe</hi> turn'd into a <hi>bleſſing;</hi> that the power of God and his very immediate work in ſpreading the light amongſt ſo <hi>many people of a ſtrange language,</hi> might now under the goſpel be more conſpicuous, that once ſuch an interdiction hath been ſerved on the world thereby, to ſhut the nations out from the Church: for we may ſay, there hath been as ſignal a miracle in the <hi>gift of
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:005185_0329_1016DCDC014D57F0"/>
tongues</hi> under the New Teſtament, as there was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in the <hi>confuſion</hi> thereof. (¶)</p>
               <p>III. What we have expreſly promiſed in the word of the <hi>Church's delivery from Egypt,</hi> and was foretold by <hi>Joſeph</hi> at his death, that <hi>God would ſurely bring back his People out of that land,</hi> for which he left his bones to lie unburied as a pledge thereof, hath now many ages paſt been fulfilled. It is long ſince that remarkable day, when God made a way for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple through the red ſea, and his power known upon <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> with the Church did ſing that triumphant ſong, <hi>The horſe and his rider he hath caſt in the ſea.</hi> Wherein theſe things are moſt clear,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this was a deed <hi>known</hi> and <hi>publick in the time;</hi> which was not done in a corner, but in the view of the World, and before all the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and by them atteſted, and with greateſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs tranſmitted to their children, and by theſe to the following generations, as a thing never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Was teſtified by <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo great a perſon, and <hi>eye witneſs</hi> thereof; one whom even the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of heathen writers do mention with much reſpect, and in this did never challenge his teſtimony, though a matter of fact, and of that moment, which all the nations about could not but know, and both in the preſent and after-ages have the remembrance thereof kept up; ſo that they might eaſily refute ſuch a thing, if falſe. And we may judge, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and many others could want no good will to put diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace on a People, they ſo much hated, nor be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of that which <hi>Moſes</hi> publiſhed in his own time; to whoſe works ſome of the ancienteſt heathen writers do ſhew they have been no ſtrangers.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="295" facs="unknown:005185_0330_1016DCDFEFCA0240"/>
3. A truth, which by <hi>Moſes</hi> was put in <hi>record,</hi> and this delivered to the <hi>Jews</hi> to be kept by them and their children in all ſucceeding ages: a record, which they did ſo narrowly look to, and had in that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and eſteem, that all the <hi>ſyllables</hi> and <hi>letters</hi> thereof were by them <hi>numbred,</hi> leſt in the ſmalleſt point it ſhould be wronged; yea, were more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preſerve it than any nation can be of their moſt concerning rights, and charters.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A thing, whereof the <hi>remembrance</hi> was <hi>yearly</hi> from that time <hi>celebrated</hi> by the Jewiſh Church: whence the inſtitution of the <hi>paſſover</hi> had its riſe; that deliverance being as a ſign and ſacramental pledge of that <hi>great ſalvation</hi> by him who is our true paſſover.</p>
               <p>IV. What is held forth in the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the more full growth of the Jewiſh Church;</hi> that <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould enjoy a <hi>Scepter,</hi> which was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by dying <hi>Jacob;</hi> and promiſed once and again to <hi>Abraham</hi> by the Lord, that <hi>his ſeed</hi> ſhould be as the <hi>ſand of the ſea,</hi> and enjoy <hi>Canaan</hi> for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; hath it not long ſince been fulfi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>led? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe things are clear,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That for many ages <hi>Iſrael</hi> did <hi>enjoy</hi> that land in a moſt <hi>flouriſhing</hi> condition; which doth in part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from thoſe very ruins and deſolations, over which they have ſo long lamented, the glory of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> once ſo famous, which cauſeth ſuch reverence amongſt them to the very rubbiſh thereof at this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they were once <hi>a people by themſelves,</hi> who were not mingled with the Nations but kept at a diſtance, by their <hi>Religion</hi> and Laws, from
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:005185_0331_1016DCE181656818"/>
the reſt of the World, as a <hi>peculiar people to the Lord</hi> is a Thing undeniable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That whilſt <hi>they</hi> enjoyed it, there was a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bleſſing of <hi>fruitfulneſs</hi> thereon above other places; ſo as that ſmall piece of ground was enough for an innumerable multitude of inhabitants; but the ſame is now at this day a barren land, an extraordinary curſe no leſs ſeen thereon, than the bleſſing was in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is alſo evident, that ſomething in the <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>carriage of this people,</hi> even in their low wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering condition, doth diſcover they have not forgot what <hi>once</hi> they were, nor their former grandeur and flouriſhing, but ſtill keep <hi>by themſelves,</hi> with ſome reſpect to their own land, which their fathers did enjoy.</p>
               <p>V. That piece of the Scripture, which did concern the <hi>declining times of the Church under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> what <hi>Jeremiah</hi> foretold of the <hi>Babyloniſh Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi> hath now many ages ſince been fulfilled: a truth, which we have atteſted by ſacred hiſtory, an hiſtory which doth clearly juſtify itſelf and its authority by ſuch convincing marks thereof, that we may ſay thoſe who do ſeriouſly converſe with the word, cannot take up Atheiſm without the laying down of reaſon, and putting a Force upon their own light.</p>
               <p>Now as to this particular prophecy we would but ſeriouſly conſider,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> did foretell about the <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,</hi> was not its accompliſhment put on <hi>record</hi> in a book of the Church's <hi>lamentations?</hi> Where this truth may be read in her tears; and truly ſuch as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew grief in a high meaſure, may eaſily know what is there expreſt, to be ſad earneſt, and read the lively motions of an afflicted caſe herein. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:005185_0332_1016DCE4E1853128"/>
hath not this been witneſſed to after-ages by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible monument, even the deſtruction of the <hi>Temple,</hi> that great and excellent work, which tho' after rebuilt did never attain its former ſplendor.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This was a matter of fact of <hi>great note,</hi> and <hi>famous in the time,</hi> done in the view of all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a conſiderable piece of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> conqueſt a yea, that teſtimony the Scripture beareth to the ſame, was it not a few ages after made publick to other parts of the world by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> tranſlation, ſo that it had been eaſy for <hi>Ptolemy</hi> or any in that time to have diſcovered the falſhood of a thing ſo lately done: yet, thoſe times, nor the moſt profeſſed enemies to the Church therein, could not in the leaſt contradict the ſame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though much of <hi>humane Hiſtory,</hi> and thoſe records of ancient times that we now have, are both corrupt and defective, yet there wants not ſome <hi>conſent,</hi> from the <hi>ſureſt of theſe,</hi> to many of the moſt obſervable things that we have of the hiſtory of the <hi>old teſtament;</hi> and as to the certainty of this truth, beſides its own authority, we ſhall find ſome of theſe oldeſt Writers, <hi>Beroſus, Herodot,</hi> and <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> give ſome light to the ſame, whoſe witneſs the Atheiſt cannot challenge; yea, is it not clear that <hi>Joſephus,</hi> not only from ſacred hiſtory, but from theſe old records and fragments of former times, which were then extant (tho' ſince have been much loſt) compoſed his <hi>Jewiſh antiquities,</hi> which give ſo particular a relation of this truth.</p>
               <p>VI. What was foretold by <hi>Daniel</hi> concerning <hi>the riſe and fall of the Monarchies,</hi> and change of thoſe great Empires, which had been ſo ſore a rod upon the Church, hath it not many ages paſt had a moſt punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual performance? It is now long ſince that great <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> ſhewed to the Prophet in a viſion, hath been
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:005185_0333_1016DCE92099D728"/>
brought down and broken, ſo that ſcarce the <hi>toes</hi> thereof do now remain: which, beſides the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may be clearly demonſtrated upon other rational grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's being granted, that the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel</hi> was tranſlated in <hi>Greek,</hi> and laid up in that great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> long before much of it was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, before <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and the riſing of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, of which <hi>Porphyrius</hi> could not be ignorant, though all he could anſwer to that evident agreement betwixt his Propheſie and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent was, that it muſt have been writ after theſe things were accompliſhed; whileſt it is clear, that a part of the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>fourth</hi> Monarchy, was not even in his times fully made out, yea we muſt ſay, ſomething thereof doth reach to the laſt end of time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo undeniable, that in theſe great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of the Monarchies there is a diſcernable <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>harmony</hi> betwixt the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and theſe <hi>ancient records,</hi> which we yet have of thoſe times: ſo that not only the things themſelves, but ſome of the moſt obſervable circumſtances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which are particularly mentioned by <hi>Daniel,</hi> we may read in <hi>Xenophen, Herodot,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It muſt alſo be granted, that ſome things which in <hi>Daniel's</hi> Propheſie would ſeem moſt ſtrange and improbable, ſuch as <hi>Belſhazar's</hi> death in that very night the hand writing was ſhewed to him, may be particularly underſtood in <hi>Xenophon's</hi> hiſtory; how <hi>Cyrus</hi> took the advantage of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> ſecurity, whileſt they were in the midſt of a ſolemn Feaſt, and by diverting the channel of <hi>Euphrates</hi> did enter the city without oppoſition; alſo how that <hi>great horn of the high goat</hi> was ſo ſuddenly broken, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming up of <hi>four in his room,</hi> which by <hi>Daniel</hi> are
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:005185_0334_1016DCEAAEC92470"/>
expounded of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy, and the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding</hi> of that Empire after <hi>Alexander's</hi> death, is it not punctually held forth by all the hiſtories of that time?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Was there not a very convincing appearance of a divine hand, both in the <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>fall</hi> of theſe <hi>Monarchies,</hi> and an extraordinary providence which we cannot but ſee, when we read theſe hiſtories, that ſurely ſomething above ordinary means and ſecond cauſes was both in <hi>Cyrus'</hi>s conqueſt over the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> and the marvellous ſwift progreſs and ſucceſs of <hi>Alexander</hi> againſt the <hi>Perſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. That which was the great ſcope of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies under the Old Teſtament, <hi>The coming of the Meſſias,</hi> is ſurely verified, and now many ages paſt hath had an accompliſhment. <hi>The Lord is come unto his Temple,</hi> even he whoſe day <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Saints under the law did long after: this was the moſt happy and notable criſis, that ever the Church was under, the great Epocha and period of time, from which ſhe doth now reckon. We know, this is <hi>no fable,</hi> or cunning device of man, <hi>that God was manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> did make his abode for ſome time in the earth, <hi>ſuffered</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the view of the World, before many witneſſes, did <hi>ariſe</hi> from death on the <hi>third day,</hi> was ſeen and known by his Diſciples thereafter, and having <hi>finiſhed the work</hi> for which he came, was <hi>received up again into glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is indeed a great truth, which concerneth us no leſs to know, and be ſure of, than our ſoul is worth, and our intereſt through eternity: the fulfilling whereof, beſides the authority of ſacred writ, the witneſs and records of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who teſtify what they certainly knew, is a truth which from ſuch convincing rational
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:005185_0335_1016DCEDD808D118"/>
grounds may be demonſtrated, that the greateſt height of Atheiſm knoweth not how to ſtate it ſelf in a direct oppoſition to the ſame. And truly in this, we may ſay, the Lord hath ſo tendered the ſtrengthning of his people's faith and their encouragement, that as it is the moſt concerning <hi>promiſe</hi> of the Scripture, on which our whole hope and bleſſedneſs depends, ſo is it alſo moſt clear and conſpicuous in the <hi>event.</hi> I ſhall but only touch this, whereof ſo much hath been ſaid by others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is undeniable, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was <hi>to come:</hi> to whom all the <hi>ſacrifices</hi> under the Law, thoſe ancient types and ſhadows, did clearly point; to whom the <hi>Prophets</hi> bear witneſs; and it was the faith of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, of which promiſe they were <hi>perſwaded,</hi> even whilſt they ſaw it but a far off, yea, did <hi>embrace</hi> it and repoſe themſelves thereon. And is there not a moſt clear and exact portraicture drawn forth under the Old Teſtament, of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> what an one he ſhould be, and by what peculiar charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he ſhould be known, who was to be revealed to Iſrael?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſpecial ſeaſon,</hi> and period of time, wherein Chriſt ſhould come, we find prefixed and ſhewed to the ancient Church: which, though under ſome figurative expreſſions ſeemed then dark, yet was ſo far revealed, that upon diligent a ſearch and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and particular collation of the times, it might be eaſy to diſcern the <hi>Meſſiah'</hi>s coming and near approach. <hi>Of which ſalvation the Prophets did enquire,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. And truly the fall of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, and right underſtanding of <hi>Daniel'</hi>s weeks, were ſure and ſolid grounds for a clear compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Thence was it, that ſo general an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was among the <hi>Jews,</hi> at that very time when he came; ſo as divers impoſtors did ariſe, who in the People were ready to follow; and
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:005185_0336_1016DCEFF43E6B90"/>
we ſee with what amazement the Phariſees did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>if he were the Chriſt, or not;</hi> yea, <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſheweth how the perſwaſion of this did moſt excite that People to war with the <hi>Romans</hi> from the prophecies they had in holy writ, that from <hi>Judea</hi> ſhould about that time come he who was to be Emperor of the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is alſo ſure, <hi>there was ſuch an one,</hi> who in the days of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and under the reign of <hi>Herod,</hi> was <hi>made manifeſt to Iſrael:</hi> and came with no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew and obſervation, but did great and marvellous things before all the People; was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> under <hi>Pontius Pilate;</hi> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ignominy of his death, was after ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and followed, both by many of the Jews and the Gentiles; whoſe doctrine did alſo in ſhort time ſpread through the World: a truth, which the greateſt adverſaries of the Goſpel have ever confeſſed, and do atteſt the hiſtory thereof, <hi>de facto,</hi> to be a faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Not only Jews, but the heathen writers, <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Plinius</hi> the younger, that lived near, and ſome of them contemporary with the Times of the Apoſtles, do witneſs that this JESUS, whom the Chriſtians worſhip, did truly ſuffer in the time of <hi>Pilate's</hi> juriſdiction over the Jews.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is it not clear, how this appearance of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the World did exactly fall in with the very time, <hi>foretold by the Prophets</hi> therefor? Was not <hi>Jacob</hi>'s prophecy thus accompliſhed? For until that time it is clear, the royal line of <hi>David</hi>'s houſe did not ceaſe, until <hi>Herod</hi> a ſtranger came to reign, by whom it was utterly cut off. And it is manifeſt, thoſe 70 <hi>weeks</hi> mentioned by <hi>Daniel,</hi> muſt be underſtood of <hi>years;</hi> elſe they could admit no other ſenſe: which reckoning from the decree given out by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to rebuild the temple, are 490 Years, and doth anſwer
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:005185_0337_1016DCF56F03C828"/>
to the very time of Chriſt being in the World, and his death, which neceſſarily falls in the laſt of theſe weeks, a thing ſo manifeſt, that <hi>Porphyrius</hi> an avowed enemy to the Chriſtian Religion, could have no anſwer, but that this prophecy had been deviſed after the event: which I am ſure; the Jews, though as direct adverſaries, would be loath to admit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is moſt clear, that <hi>in him,</hi> who at that time was revealed to Iſrael and whom the Chriſtian Church doth this day worſhip, was <hi>exactly accompliſhed</hi> whatever was by the <hi>Prophets</hi> told concerning the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> And it is no ſmall advantage for the Chriſtian cauſe, that it needs but appeal to thoſe records, which have been kept in the hands of her adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, where there is ſo clear a portraicture of him held forth, as to his perſon, his way of coming, the place whence, the entertainment he ſhould have, and his death, that I muſt think it a contradiction to reaſon, men ſhould acknowledge the <hi>Old</hi> Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, and not grant the <hi>New;</hi> ſince it is clear, the <hi>Jews,</hi> look for no other <hi>Meſſias,</hi> than ſuch an one as is held out by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alſo the divine authority of <hi>Iſaiah, Daniel, Micah Malachi,</hi> &amp;c. who do by ſuch clear marks point him forth, and ſhew the Church how they ſhould know him when he cometh. For truly it may thence appear, that it is not more certain, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould come, than that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is he. I would but ſeriouſly aſk, what do the Jews this day miſs in our bleſſed Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alloweth them to expect in the <hi>Meſſias!</hi> Is it that he came not with <hi>outward</hi> ſhew and glory? ſure, according to the Scripture, ſuch an one we ought <hi>not</hi> to acknowledge; no, ſhould he not be <hi>the ſeed of the woman</hi> (<hi>Gen.</hi> 2.) who ſhould be <hi>born of a virgin,</hi> as, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſheweth: <hi>his voice not heard in the ſtreets; deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:005185_0338_1016DCF6FB4AF098"/>
ſorrows?</hi> Such an one, as was ſhadowed out under the Law, who ſhould be made a ſacrifice for ſin; yea, come with no outward pomp, but <hi>meek and lowly, and riding upon an aſs,</hi> was to be betrayed, and ſold (and <hi>his price</hi> ſhewed by <hi>Zachariah</hi>) for 30 pieces; a crucified dying Chriſt, that ſhould be <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the houſe of his friends,</hi> and <hi>cut off from amongſt the children of his People!</hi> O! can men poſſibly deny ſo clear an accompliſhment of theſe in our bleſſed Lord?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Is it not undeniable, that the <hi>Jews</hi> now, in their <hi>preſent caſe, cannot poſſibly expect</hi> the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>this</hi> promiſe; that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> cannot this day come, <hi>according to the Scripture,</hi> except they could be put in ſuch a condition, as they were in then at Chriſt's coming? Certainly it is impoſſible, that the Old Teſtament be ever fulfilled about this, if it be not already. Can he come forth out of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> whilſt now no ſuch place is known by that name? Can he come into his <hi>Temple,</hi> that is utterly deſtroyed? Is there not now a ſubverſion of the Tribes, and the family of <hi>David</hi> not known at this day? Yea, are not the <hi>gentiles brought in,</hi> whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſheweth ſhould be <hi>gathered under the ſtandard of the Meſſias?</hi> Doth not the <hi>daily ſacrifice ceaſe?</hi> which, the Jews will confeſs, hath been ſo for many ages; and this was to be after his coming. And I would aſk, how was that ever fulfilled, that <hi>the glory of the ſecond Temple</hi> ſhould <hi>exceed</hi> the glory of the <hi>firſt?</hi> for this cannot be on the account of its ſtructure, or outward magnificence; ſure there is nothing, wherein this glory could appear, but as it points at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the breaking out of that <hi>glorious light,</hi> which was before its deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="7">7. There is an innumerable company, who have <hi>embraced the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>received the ſpirit</hi> by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry thereof, ſince the times of the Apoſtles, who
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:005185_0339_1016DCFA2BEAD7F8"/>
have put this ſeal thereto in all ages, that it is <hi>the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and wiſdom of God.</hi> And truly without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reſpect (which the conſciences of the worſt of men have been forced to juſtify) it may be ſaid, theſe were <hi>the excellent of the earth</hi> in their time: many of greateſt outward parts and abilities, whoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral integrity and candour was beyond queſtion even with their adverſaries; and theſe both of Jews and Gentiles, of all ranks of men, of all nations and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; who not only by a naked profeſſion, but by their walk and ſufferings did ſhew forth the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and vertue of a <hi>crucified Chriſt;</hi> yea, <hi>ſhine as lights</hi> whilſt they were in the World, to the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpectators. And is not this a convincing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truth of the Goſpel, which its enemies cannot poſſibly deny?</p>
               <p n="8">8. That excellent <hi>doctrine,</hi> delivered to the Church in the New Teſtament, by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, doth it not clearly ſhew whence it is, and witneſs its own authority? For here we may ſee a manifeſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt this and the doctrine of the ancient Jewiſh Church; that as the five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> hold forth the ſum of the Goſpel, the Covenant of grace, and that myſtery of Salvation by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo the Prophets do carry it on with further clearneſs, and the Evangeliſts bring it forward: like an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent edifice that is founded and advanced in the one, but perfected in the other: all breathing the ſame ſpirit, with a convincing tendency to the ſame end. So that we may ſay the old <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law were in effect <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the followers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> now under the Goſpel in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect are <hi>Jews;</hi> being one in the ſubſtantials of their religion. For it is clear, that poor Apoſtate people now of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation hath wholly departed from their own doctrine, and <hi>will not come to the light,</hi> that they may be judged according to the Old
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:005185_0340_1016DCFC411A9F90"/>
Teſtament. Now in this I would ſeriouſly atteſt the adverſaries of the Goſpel, if <hi>paganiſm,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> Alcoran, or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Talmud hold forth any ſuch doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or rule as that which the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion doth! ſuch pure, and excellent precepts, to reſtrain the inordinacy of corrupt affection, backed with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments becoming an immortal ſoul; a doctrine ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ſolid, and rational, ſo conſiſtent with it ſelf, and agreable to the true ſcope and drift thereof, which holds forth the moſt exquiſite rule of perfection, for men to preſs after; yea, where every page and line breatheth forth holineſs towards God, and righteouſneſs and humanity towards man!</p>
               <p n="9">9. I ſhall add, thoſe clear convincing <hi>evidences</hi> of the truth of the Goſpel, which did attend the <hi>firſt publiſhing</hi> thereof were ſo manifeſt and undeniable a <hi>ſeal</hi> from the Lord, as may force the greateſt Atheiſt to ſilence. For,—(1.) They were <hi>Jews</hi> as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the Religion of their Fathers as any, who did <hi>firſt</hi> publiſh the Goſpel; none more zealous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, than <hi>Paul</hi> was before his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; none alſo could challenge their driving an outward intereſt hereby, ſince perſecution and bonds, yea, greateſt hazard was that which they muſt expect.—(2.) It is clear, they walked by <hi>no</hi> rule of <hi>human</hi> policy, nor thoſe ordinary ways of <hi>inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> which the World doth uſe, to engage men, and make a party <hi>to themſelves:</hi> but did deliver the <hi>truth,</hi> truth moſt repugnant to the fleſh and its intereſts, with greateſt <hi>candour</hi> and <hi>ſimplicity,</hi> though likewiſe with a convincing <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>confidence;</hi> yea, came with a meſſage to the World, which had no other convoy, or perſwading argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the evidence of its own truth, yet withal ſuch a <hi>power</hi> accompanying the ſame, before which men could not ſtand.—(3.) <hi>What is publiſhed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt</hi> by the Evangeliſts, the great works he
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:005185_0341_1016DD019DBC03C8"/>
did, his dying at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with all the ſtupendous circumſtances thereof and ſigns from Heaven, was <hi>not a thing done in a corner,</hi> but in the publick view of men, which in thoſe days was moſt known and famous: but yet there cannot be produced one <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory</hi> teſtimony, to the truth of theſe relations, by any adverſary of the Goſpel, either at that time, or ſince. Sure the World wanted no malice, and theſe great things were early publiſhed by the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts and Apoſtles, whileſt much of that generation was alive; yet it is clear, though in a matter of that concernment, which made then ſo great a noiſe, and was at that time putting the earth all in a flame, none was found either among Jews or gentiles, who could or durſt put forth a manifeſto, to diſcover the leaſt cheat or falſhood in thoſe things atteſted in the Hiſtory of the Goſpel.—(4.) Whatever different <hi>parties</hi> and <hi>ſects</hi> did break out with the firſt time of the Church, to <hi>oppoſe</hi> the truth in <hi>other</hi> things, yet in this they had <hi>all one conſent,</hi> that <hi>he who was crucified at Jeruſalem,</hi> was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Which truly did witneſs the clear irreſiſtible manifeſtation of this truth in thoſe times; ſince, if there could have been the leaſt ground to challenge any impoſture or deceit in this great foundation of the Chriſtian faith, it is more than probable, thoſe bitter contentions, followed with ſuch animoſity and heat and irritation, of thoſe whom the Apoſtles and Church in that time did with much zeal and ſharpeſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures purſue, would have engaged them to put all the diſgrace upon the truth, which they could, if they might have had where to faſten their teeth. I would further add, that even the <hi>arguments</hi> and <hi>objections,</hi> which the adverſaries of the Goſpel could ever bring, to oppoſe the ſame, are indeed a convincing witneſs and confirmation, and ſhew how <hi>little</hi> they could any way ſay, in giving their malice a vent. We find
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:005185_0342_1016DD0329F7AAE8"/>
that abſurd allegation of the Jews, that the great <hi>works</hi> Chriſt did in the days of his fleſh, were <hi>by ſtealing the name</hi> JEHOVAH <hi>out of the templ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> which they alledge he ſewed up in his thigh: which truly needeth no further refutation but the reciting thereof. And here they are even forced to witneſs the truth of thoſe relations held forth by the Evangeliſts, as to the matter of fact, which we find alſo theſe later Atheiſts, ſuch as <hi>Vanninus, Cardan,</hi> &amp;c. dare not challenge or debate: only they would aſcribe theſe great works which Chriſt then wrought, to the influence of the <hi>ſtars;</hi> a challenge ſo abſurd, that needs no other anſwer but to relate it.</p>
               <p>VIII. We have that remarkable Prophecy of <hi>the incoming of the Gentiles,</hi> a truth indeed great and marvellous, which is expreſly held forth in the Old Teſtament (<hi>Iſ.</hi> 54. 1, 2. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 60. 3, 9.) is a thing ſo clearly now written forth in the <hi>event,</hi> that I am ſure, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Atheſts can have no ſhift here; but muſt own that in this ſtrange work of God about his Church, the Scripture hath an undeniable accompliſhment. Now to clear this let us but conſider,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>for many ages</hi> this truth about the incal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the gentiles was <hi>ſealed up in a prophecy;</hi> a thing ſo great and aſtoniſhing to the ancient Jewiſh Church, that they could not well comprehend the ſame, until once the event brought it forth. For this was indeed <hi>a myſtery hid from ages,</hi> how <hi>the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhould be fellow-heirs, of the ſame body, and Partakers of the promiſe in Chriſt;</hi> when the bounds and extent of the Church did not exceed <hi>Judea,</hi> that ſmall incloſure, whileſt the whole World beſide did lie buried, like an outfield, in dark Paganiſm. For it is well known, that the moſt pleaſant places of <hi>Africa, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> where afterwards many famous
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:005185_0343_1016DD068A3B7608"/>
Churches were, within theſe 1600 years was but a ſavage wilderneſs: <hi>Britain, Germany</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> did then worſhip the ſun and ſtars, they ſacrificed to the Gods of the heathens; yea, thoſe eaſtern parts on which the ſun did firſt riſe, did not then know th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>God of Iſrael:</hi> a truth, which not only the Roman and Grecian Hiſtories, but the records of particular Nations can clearly atteſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is clear, that this prophecy was not held forth only in general; but we find the <hi>time</hi> alſo prefixed (with other ſpecial circumſtances) when it ſhould have its accompliſhment, <hi>at the appearing of the Meſſias.</hi> He ſhould be <hi>revealed to Iſrael;</hi> before which time a bar was drawn in the way of <hi>the Nations,</hi> and a <hi>wall of partition</hi> betwixt them and the Church, <hi>until he ſtand up</hi> who ſhould hold forth <hi>an enſign to the People,</hi> and <hi>gather the Gentiles under his ſtandard;</hi> which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth clearly ſhew, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 11. 10. <hi>and</hi> 34. 1, 2. <hi>and</hi> 60. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then muſt the <hi>mountains flow down at his preſence, Nations be born at once;</hi> yea, the <hi>light break forth to the Eaſt and the Weſt;</hi> then ſhould <hi>the Children of the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late be more then of the married wife,</hi> when this time even the ſet time for the gentiles is once come. And it may be very convincing, which is moſt obſervable, that notwithſtanding of a more flouriſhing condition of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in former ages, when her grandeur and proſperity was more tempting, and the neighbourhood and commerce which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about had with that People, yea, though by the captivity they were ſcattered among the <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians;</hi> yet was there no ſuch ſtir or change of the World, until the <hi>appointed time</hi> once came.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may be eaſy to prove the <hi>event</hi> of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and its manifeſt <hi>accompliſhment,</hi> even <hi>at the time</hi> thereof. For this men cannot deny,
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:005185_0344_1016DD09C8B71058"/>
                  <hi>that the Lord did viſit the Gentiles</hi> with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his truth: Which then cauſed ſuch a change in the earth, as a great part of it hath been brought from heatheniſh idolatry, to worſhip the <hi>God of Iſrael;</hi> and ſuch who once were ſtrangers and aliens, now made to profeſs the ſame faith (as to the ſubſtance thereof) of the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church. Sure this truth needs not want a witneſs, whilſt Nations and much of the known World have been for ſo long a time, and yet to this day are, a viſible proof thereof; a truth of ſuch concernment, that in former ages made a great and ſtupendous change up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face of the earth, ſo that not only an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company out of all Nations and languages, but the generality, the very complex body of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> can bear Witneſs thereto. And now the Goſpel hath been preached through much of the World; yea, we may ſay, there are few parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, where there hath not been ſome face of a <hi>Church:</hi> Though the promiſe hath not yet had it's full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, but we wait for (according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) a more flouriſhing time, and great harveſt among the Nations, when <hi>Iſrael ſhall be gathered:</hi> however, it is ſure, the Lord hath in a great part ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled this his promiſe, ſo that the Church might then with aſtoniſhment cry out, <hi>Who hath begotten all theſe Children! Who are theſe that flee as a cloud, like the doves to their Windows!</hi> O bleſſed day, in which the light did firſt break forth on the poor off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of <hi>Japhet,</hi> who then dwelt in the ſhadow and region of death! O bleſt day, that <hi>brought ſalvation</hi> with it to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> wherein the Lord did <hi>viſit thoſe dark places of the earth, which were full of the habitations of cruelty.</hi> I think, the ſenſe of ſo great a mercy ſhould never let us want an errand for giving thanks, yea, put much to ſilence our other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
               <p n="4">

4. It is not only as to the time, but thoſe very <hi>places</hi> of the earth, which <hi>Eſaias</hi> &amp; other of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets did particularly point at, this promiſe had an exact accompliſhment? For it is this day manifeſt, as to the <hi>Iſles,</hi> which we find ſo frequently mentioned, that theſe ſhould <hi>wait for his Law,</hi> &amp; the <hi>uttermoſt parts of the earth, whence he ſhould bring the Daughter of his diſperſed,</hi> we may get a clear commentary upon the ſame, from what the Lord hath done to <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with other remote parts of the earth: yea, have not <hi>AEthiopians</hi> been made to <hi>ſtretch out their hands</hi> even in thoſe ſun-burnt places of <hi>Africa?</hi> Hath not Chriſt alſo had a conqueſt, where many a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For it is indeed clear, that the bounds of the Church was then of a larger extent, than it is now at this day.—(2.) It is alſo undeniable, that in this ſolemn day of the Goſpel's ſpreading amongſt the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>ſuffering</hi> and <hi>perſecution</hi> did all that time <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Church;</hi> yea, in ſuch a meaſure, that as the writers of thoſe times do witneſs, neither famine, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor the ſword did deſtroy ſo many of the World, as then were of Chriſtians in the two firſt centuries put to death for adhering to the truth: and it is clear, that this great work of God, in ſuch a ſwift ſpreading of the Church, was <hi>moſt diſcernable</hi> in thoſe times of hotteſt perſecution; yea, then was her moſt <hi>effectual growth</hi> and <hi>increaſe,</hi> which upon her getting ſome reſt, and beginning to flouriſh with external peace, was at a viſible ſtand.—(3.)

(which is the great advantage we require, to have its authority admitted, and their Religion brought to this teſt) which is the alone rule of all true Religion; and ſince they muſt grant that to be joined with <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> or partaker in ſuch a way, is moſt dreadful, and involves them under the greateſt of judgments; for it is a matter of no leſs weight, than an eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or damnation: yea ſince this concerns Miniſters of the Goſpel, as one ſpecial part of their work now in the laſt times, to bear witneſs againſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> (that <hi>great,</hi> we muſt ſay the <hi>greateſt</hi> adverſary, which Chriſt ever had in the earth) to warn and purſue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing this call, whatever ſucceſs it have, <hi>that men would come out of Babylon,</hi> and haſte from under an approaching wrath and vengeance, which on ſome other ground, than appearance, we are ſure, now makes haſte; I would here in behalf of the truth offer ſome queries on this ſubject. (beſides any thing hath been already mentioned) and herein appeal the adverſary to the Scripture of God, that great and uncontroverted judge &amp; to their own conſcience, yea to the ſober &amp; retired tho'ts of ſuch, who are under any awe or impreſſion of a Deity, when they are alone with themſelves, if this ſo remarkable a Propheſy, about the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> &amp; his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, be not now clearly verified, that men may ſee him with their eyes, or elſe muſt ſhut them at ſuch a ſight.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Is there not a very <hi>full</hi> and <hi>particular diſcovery</hi> which the Scripture gives of this great <hi>Adverſary,</hi> both in his riſe &amp; growth, his reign and fall; and not meerly by a paſſing word: whom the Apoſtle, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 3, 4. points out by ſuch peculiar marks; whom <hi>John</hi> do's deſcribe and difference from all other <hi>Antichriſts,</hi> that were only to be his forerunners, &amp; ſhews him a more noted and principal adverſary of Chriſt above others; yea, we have through the whole <hi>Revelation</hi> moſt clearly diſcovered, under different ſtiles, what he ſhould be, and what a ſore and long trial the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:005185_0357_1016DD260F569ED8"/>
Church was to have under his reign. I profeſs, when I read the Scripture, and there ſee ſo expreſs and clear a forewarning, which many ages before we have about the <hi>coming</hi> of this adverſary, with ſuch pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar diſtinguiſhing circumſtances and marks, as are at this day moſt exactly verified in the event, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to admire at ſo convincing and unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a witneſs to the Scripture's divinity; and muſt think it ſtrange, how men at ſuch a rate can wreſtle againſt the truth, except by getting a victory over their conſcience, and putting the light in fetters, whilſt they own theſe Propheſies of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be of divine verity; which yet they ſo evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtort, againſt the clear ſenſe and meaning thereof; yea, do adventure ſuch a commentary on the ſame, that manifeſtly deſtroys the text.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Can you poſſibly expect <hi>Antichriſt's coming</hi> to the world <hi>now</hi> according to the Scripture, if he be <hi>not already revealed;</hi> when his forerunners were ſo many ages before, even in the times of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, to ſhew he was then coming? I muſt aſk, if this adverſary ſhould this day begin to appear, could you judge this is he, or reconcile ſuch a contradiction, how he is <hi>now</hi> breaking out, who was <hi>beginning</hi> to diſcover himſelf 1500 years ago? For it is ſo long ſince the Apoſtle ſhew'd, <hi>this myſtery of iniquity was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> (2 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. 7.) which clearly points at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> who then was hatching, though not on ſuch a growth and aſcendant, as after; and could he be yet latent, yet in the bud? Hath there been no further advance, after ſo many ages? Hath this myſtery yet not wrought it ſelf above ground? O where hath he been? that ſuch a <hi>working</hi> thing, ſo dreadful a ſpark could keep ſo many ages under aſhes, and no flame, no fire perceived? For it is ſure if he was then <hi>at work,</hi> he hath not yet ceaſed. Yea, if you admit the Scripture, is not the riſing of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi>

               <p n="3">3. Is not this unanſwerably manifeſt, that <hi>he who did withold,</hi> and as a bar reſtrained <hi>Antichriſts coming for a time,</hi> cannot now be ſtanding in the way? You ſee, the Scripture ſhews expreſly there is a bar muſt be <hi>removed,</hi> and then ſhould this <hi>man of ſin</hi> be <hi>revealed</hi> and this cannot be doubted, but that ſome temporal power was hereby meant, which did then <hi>forcibly withſtand</hi> (as the original word KATEX<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. This query I would ſeriouſly offer; if ſuch a party can be found <hi>this day,</hi> to whom all the <hi>marks</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> held forth by the Scripture, do truly <hi>agree,</hi> could you then <hi>deny</hi> that he is <hi>come;</hi> if ſo be you look for <hi>ſuch</hi> an Antichriſt, and under that cogniſance, as the holy Ghoſt points him forth in the world? O will you be ſo much in earneſt with your conſcience, as to ſuffer the truth to come thus near, that you may impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially

judge what is there of the <hi>Propheſies,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns <hi>Antichriſt</hi> coming in the world, which is not now verified in the <hi>event</hi> before your eyes; and admit the Scripture but judge therein, whether there is any ſuch particular diſtinguiſhing badge and mark, held forth in that bleſſed record for his diſcovery, which does not convincingly quadrate with the <hi>Pope,</hi> and his followers.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I ſhall in this alſo appeal your conſcience, if there be now or hath been under the new Teſtament an <hi>other</hi> party, or ſuch an <hi>adverſary</hi> to the Church of Chriſt, to whom theſe diſtinguiſhing characters of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> could agree: ſuch an one who ſhould be no open adverſary, but <hi>ſit in the temple of God</hi> under the vail of a friend, with a ſhew of great <hi>wonders</hi> and <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> and yet under that ſhew <hi>exalt himſelf againſt God.</hi> I know, you will deny that this hath a clear reſpect to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party, or is juſtly applicable to them: but I am ſure, if without a prejudicate byaſs you would ſeriouſly judge, and abſtract from appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in this you could not deny an aſſent, that <hi>ſuch a party</hi> (whoſoever he be) bears that great badge of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in <hi>exalting himſelf againſt God?</hi> who, as a friend, doth aſſume thoſe <hi>titles</hi> only due &amp; compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the glorious God, and to the Mediator, to be <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>chief Doctor</hi> of the Catholick Church, and alledges her for <hi>his ſpouſe,</hi> who challengeth an infinite power, by making uſe of that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>All power is given unto me,</hi> &amp;c.

who is the great Prophet and teacher of his Church, yea, a making his authority void? Now, beſide theſe diſtinguiſhing characters, which the Scripture, ſo expreſly gives of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> are not theſe alſo ſo notorious and plain, that I think it ſtrange how men can have their reaſon and judgment in exerciſe, and not know to whom they belong; I mean, <hi>the forbidding of marriage,</hi> and of <hi>the uſe of meats,</hi> which the Apoſtle holds forth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. and in <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 13. you have there a <hi>merchandiſe with the ſouls of men.</hi> And O can any be in the dark, <hi>who</hi> theſe are, that have ſuch a peculiar traffick with this ware, by redeeming ſouls for money, and making a ſale of pardons and indulgences, which concern men's ſouls. I ſhall add that likewiſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 20. <hi>the worſhiping of idols of gold and ſilver;</hi> and herein crave the world to be judge, yea, can appeal to ſome of their own greateſt writers, if this be not both the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and the practice of the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi> which one of the moſt learn'd among them does expreſly aſſert, that the <hi>images</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> are not ſet up for a ſhew, but for Religious <hi>Adoration.</hi> And is not this a moſt direct making void of the moral law? which ſo expreſly forbids any worſhipping of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God under the <hi>ſimilitude of a corruptible man,</hi> or under any viſible repreſentation.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Is not this foretold of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> what a <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> he ſhould have over the <hi>Kings</hi> of the earth (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 18.) unto whom they ſhould <hi>agree,</hi> and <hi>give their power and Kingdoms,</hi> to ſupport his intereſt? Now if this be not convincingly verified, and hath been for many ages in the <hi>Pope,</hi> it is eaſy to judge: and I am ſure, his followers would be loth to deny a thing, in which they ſo much boaſt. I confeſs, were it not thus foretold by the Scripture, we could not think it credible, how the <hi>Kings</hi> and great men of the earth ſhould be in ſuch a meaſure <hi>bewitched,</hi> to enſlave
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:005185_0361_1016DD2ACFF69028"/>
themſelves and their intereſt to that party, and yield to ſo ſtrange a ſubjection under their yoke; it ſeems ſo very irrational, yea, like an infatuation, ſince they cannot but ſee under what a terror he keeps them by his interdictions, by aſſuming a power to looſe ſubjects from any tie to their Princes; and thus binding and looſing their conſcience at his pleaſure, what intereſt he hath in their counſels, by that ſubtile device of auricular confeſſion; what intollerable ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and ſervice he requires from Princes; what vaſt treaſure he draws for ſupport of his Hierarchy, from thoſe places where he hath power; yea, what a viſible tendency his actings have to promote a worldly intereſt, and make the great men of the earth dependent on him; how eaſily he can diſpenſe with the greateſt breaches of the moral law, whilſt moſt cruel and inexorable in any thing that interferes with his power and ſupremacy; O how aſtoniſhing might this blind devoting of great men, both themſelves and their power, to the ſupport of ſuch an intereſt be, if we had not a clear reſolution from the Scripture, that this is <hi>from the Lord,</hi> who hath <hi>put it in their heart,</hi> and ſo far gives them up in his ſecret judgment!</p>
               <p n="7">7. I muſt aſk, is not that a convincing witneſs to the Scripture, and a clear argument for the <hi>Proteſtant reformed Church,</hi> which you ſo much object againſt her, that <hi>her condition</hi> for ſo many ages hath been <hi>low</hi> and <hi>abject,</hi> and did ſo little appear, whilſt the <hi>Popiſh</hi> intereſt was reſplendent and flouriſhing; For it is ſure, ſuch a long continued ſuffering, and latent condition of the Church under <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly foretold, wherein the <hi>witneſſes</hi> ſhould be put to <hi>propheſy in ſackcloth,</hi> and the poor <hi>woman</hi> (which is meant of the Church) put to <hi>flee to the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and be there <hi>hid:</hi> ſo that you cannot ſay, the Church and followers of Chriſt have been more low in theſe worſt and darkeſt times, than the word

holds her out to be. Yet, hath there been ſtill a <hi>ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> and ſome witneſs for the truth, and the Church thus continued in all theſe times, which (as one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently ſays) was like a freſh river that made her way through that horrid lake of Antichriſtianiſm, without mixing therewith, and at laſt did break out glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Is not the <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in a ſpecial way pointed out in the Scripture, by ſome <hi>proper mark?</hi> ſome <hi>viſible ſign</hi> and <hi>cogniſance,</hi> which his <hi>followers</hi> ſhould <hi>receive,</hi> for <hi>differencing</hi> them for any other party, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 16. Now in this I deſire the World and commoneſt obſervers to judge, if thoſe many ſtrange <hi>ceremonies</hi> and rites of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, their diſtinguiſhing ſigns and badges (which they ſo much own and indiſpenſibly require, as viſible charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their profeſſion, yea, are ſo peculiar to that party beyond others) do not convincing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quadrate with the Scripture herein, and moſt clearly verify the ſame in the event. The World knows, and the ordinary way and practice of theſe can witneſs, that frequent uſe (oh a moſt horrid, idolatrous abuſe!) of the ſign of the <hi>croſs;</hi> which not only in a ſpecial manner they take as a <hi>differencing badge</hi> of their party from others, by ſo frequent a croſſing of their forehead and breaſt, and putting this as their mark on all they baptiſe, or receive by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation; but do aſcribe alſo to it an <hi>effective</hi> and <hi>operative</hi> power, and as a charm or magical ſign makes uſe of it to effect things ſurpernatural, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain ſin, drive away the Devil. For thus they conjure ſpirits, thus they wear it in their rings, and pendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; yea, is it not by them adored and worſhiped, and made uſe of for the bleſſing and conſecration of all other things: Sure, this can be no matter of debate, ſince it is ſo known and obvious, and that it is eaſy thus to diſcern a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> if he but avow

his profeſſion, by ſuch a viſible ſign, and find him but by his mark; which that party does purſue with greateſt fervour, and thereby correſpond and diſcover themſelves one to another.</p>
               <p>I ſhall further add, Is not this the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> whoſe <hi>name</hi> muſt be underſtood, and reckoned by the <hi>number</hi> thereof, which is the <hi>number of a man! Rev.</hi> 13. 18. It is true, this ſeems very dark and myſterious, and in ſtead of a more clear diſcovery, might rather be judged a drawing a vail over this adverſary: but ſince we have the Scriptures expreſs call and warrant, to make a ſerious inquiry and ſearch about its meaning, yea, does not only hold it forth as duty, but ſhews ſuch a thing is attainable, and may be underſtood, I ſhall deſire in humble ſobriety, without peremptory aſſerting, to offer ſome few thoughts on this Scripture, both as to its meaning, and how clearly <hi>the man of ſin</hi> is thus pointed out and his <hi>name</hi> made known by the <hi>number</hi>

                  </gap> about which I humbly judge (and muſt therein crave liberty to differ from others, and thoſe whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I moſt highly reſpect) that this <hi>number</hi> (as it is here ſet down) is explicatory, and given as the very key to the Church, for opening the myſtery of this <hi>name,</hi> and of that <hi>man</hi> of whom alſo it is the number; and thus ſhew's, it is not to be reckoned as the name of a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon, nor is it to be found by Arithmetical computation in the numeral letters of a man, but is the name of a <hi>politick body,</hi> a name which comprehends a plurality, ſuch as thoſe nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous orders and degrees of the <hi>pontifical</hi> Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy are; and by ſuch a ſcale, his number does remarkably aſcend in ſo many degrees, until it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in <hi>a man,</hi> even in one abſolute Monarch and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Head, as the very <hi>Summa totalis,</hi> in whom that whole number reſolves, and therefore it is <hi>the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of a man.</hi> Yea, by this reckoning, we may thus
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:005185_0364_1016DD793B61C458"/>
clearly know <hi>what</hi> a man that is; that as he cannot be known, if we take him alone, without reſpect to a politick body and the whole complex <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> of which <hi>number</hi> he is made up, as the conſtituent parts, we muſt alſo underſtand, by this computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> with reſpect to a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued <hi>ſeries</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſion,</hi> which here the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhews to the Church: that he is not a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual perſon only, or ſuch a politick body, of many numerous degrees, reſolving in one head, which ſhould be but for an age, or of a ſhort duration; but that he is an adverſary who is to be continued, in a <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſucceſſion,</hi> through a ſeries of many ages. And thus may the <hi>man of ſin</hi> and <hi>his name</hi> be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by this <hi>number,</hi> of which he is made up. Now in this, I humbly judge, the ſcope of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is clear, in ſetting down ſuch a rule to count An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt by <hi>his number,</hi> and thus does prophetically ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate that great miſtake, after-ages would fall into, and is to this day entertained, that this adverſary is but one individual perſon, who ſhould get up, and cauſe a remarkable Apoſtacy in the Church; therefore it is, that the World will not know this is he, when they ſee him before their eyes; not conſidering that ſuch a <hi>numerous</hi> body and ſucceſſion is contained in his <hi>name,</hi> from which he cannot be ſeparate.</p>
               <p>But for further clearing, I ſhall offer ſome few things to be ſeriouſly conſidered in his reckoning. (1) Here is a <hi>number,</hi> and plurality, by the Holy Ghoſt particularly ſet down, by which <hi>Antichriſt</hi> muſt be known and counted: and the tie is ſo cloſe betwixt him and his <hi>number,</hi> that both the man, and his name is formally made up thereof.—(2.) Here is a <hi>number</hi> which is not to be ſought after by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile computations of <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> or any curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry in the numeral letters of a man's name; ſince thus we cannot know the true uſe of Chriſtian wiſdom
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:005185_0365_1016DD32D7058A18"/>
and prudence, which the Scripture requires; yea, it is clear, this way might anſwer ſeveral other names, as well as <hi>Lateinos,</hi> which could not in an ordinary way be determined, without a pretending to ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary revelation and diſcovery. But here may be judged work for ſpiritual <hi>wiſdom,</hi> to count this <hi>number</hi> of Antichriſt, and his <hi>name,</hi> with reſpect to his nature, frame, and compoſition.—(3.) Here is ſuch a <hi>number,</hi> which is all ſummed up in <hi>one man,</hi> and cannot otherways be counted or underſtood, but as it hath a reſpect to a ſingle perſon, in a continued <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,</hi> wherein it reſolves. Now, is there not ſuch a <hi>number,</hi> to which the <hi>Pope</hi> ſtands as nearly related, as the total ſum is to thoſe degrees, and leſſer num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, of which it is made up? And here is <hi>wiſdom,</hi> to join aright that <hi>man of ſin,</hi> and his <hi>number,</hi> and there ſee how exactly they quadrate in the event, and each gives light to an other.—(4.) We find here a <hi>large number,</hi> wherein there is a plurality of many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees, riſing one above other, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore definitely expreſſed by ſo great a number as 666.—(5.) This is alſo a <hi>number</hi> (and herein there ſeems clear ground for ſuch a remark) which is moſt <hi>unite</hi> and <hi>compact,</hi> with a cloſe concatenation, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>order,</hi> and riſing from a lower to a higher degree, with a ſpecial ſubordination and dependance on other; yea, is thus knit, that one part compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the other; ſuch as is moſt clear and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in that ſubtile politick conſtitution of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> State, and that numerous <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> with which this definite number of 666 ſeems marvellouſly to quadrate: where by a ſcale of ſo many ſteps and degrees, you may follow up this number, as it were from ſix to ſixty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by Deans, Provincials, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of Orders, to Biſhops, thence Archbiſhops, Primates, Patriarchs, Cardinals, until you find all reſolve in one man; who is as ſtraitly related to it, as
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:005185_0366_1016DD7BF706A798"/>
a <hi>name</hi> can be to ſo many <hi>ſyllables,</hi> whereof it is made up. I know, this may ſeem too curious an inquiry, and not ſo ſuiting the gravity and weight of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but ſince the Spirit of God hath choſe ſuch a definite number before another, wherein there is ſo ſtrange an order and quadration, to diſcover that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and gives us ſuch ground that his <hi>number</hi> points at his <hi>frame</hi> and compoſition, I think, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any challenge of unſobriety, ſuch a remark very ſutable.—6. Whilſt the Scripture ſhews, this is <hi>the number of a man,</hi> and <hi>of his name,</hi> does it not alſo ſhew, it is ſuch a number that lies neareſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and is moſt ſtraitly related to him; and as the formal cauſe, does moſt ſpecially concur in his conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea, gives as it were life to that image? Now let it be ſeriouſly conſidered <hi>what</hi> this is, yea, whither that myſtery of Antichriſtianiſm does not in a peculiar way lie in his <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and being <hi>infallible</hi> and the ultimate <hi>judge</hi> of controverſies, which he claims as abſolute <hi>Head</hi> of the Church univerſal, and that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whence all thoſe degrees of power in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Hierarchy do flow, and in whom they fully termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. For it is clear, thence are all thoſe groſs tenets, and corruptions in doctrine. Thus he moſt directly <hi>exalts himſelf againſt</hi> God, and puts the Mediator off his throne: thus he does exerciſe authority over men's conſcience; thus Antichriſtianiſm, and that avowed oppoſition to Jeſus Chriſt, takes life, is nouriſhed, and hath its ſtrength, even under thoſe wings of his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſupremacy. Now if it be clear that this is the <hi>number</hi> which lies neareſt to <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> from which he can no ways be ſeparated, and does moſt formally make up that <hi>man of ſin,</hi> then by the exerciſe of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian <hi>wiſdom</hi> may that number, and its true meaning be thence underſtood.—(7.) Is not this ſuch a <hi>number,</hi> that is peculiarly reſtricted, in a claſs by it ſelf, which the 18th Ver. does ſhew, wherein that great Bulk of the
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:005185_0367_1016DD3466E9DE48"/>
                  <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church is not to be ſought? For though it is there clear, that ſuch who receive the mark, and by ſome viſible profeſſion own the doctrine of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> Church, are of the largeſt extent, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, great and ſmall, rich and poor, muſt come that length, yet as to the <hi>number</hi> of the beaſt, and of his <hi>name,</hi> it is expreſſed by its ſelf, and as a higher claſs, in which all of the common rank who muſt receive the mark, do not fall: but as lying more cloſe and near to <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> is in a peculiar manner reſtricted by a diſtinguiſhing note; which a ſerious ſtudy of that Scripture will help to clear. (¶)</p>
               <p>XI. What was propheſied about <hi>the killing of the witneſſes under Antichriſt, (Rev.</hi> 11. 3, 7, 8.) we may ſay, hath clearly come to paſs, and at this day may read the ſame in the event. For it is manifeſt,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That during <hi>Antichriſt</hi>'s reign, even in the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt times, there <hi>wanted not ſome to ſeal the truth,</hi> and bear witneſs thereto, both by open confeſſion, and ſuffering on that account, which the Church-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories can abundantly make out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That during that dark night thoſe who did give a teſtimony, and any way appeared againſt the grievous encroachments of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in behalf of down-born truth, were put to <hi>prophecy in ſackcloth,</hi> when there was nothing left, but to weep over the Church's ruins, and witneſs their deteſtation and grief for the growing Apoſtacy of ſuch times.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is clear, that as the <hi>prophecy</hi> doth point at ſome more <hi>remarkable ſuffering</hi> and <hi>perſecution,</hi> which the Church was to meet with from <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all it had endured from that adverſary in former ages; yea, a ſpecial permiſſion from the Lord to that party, to vent their rage and cruelty againſt the Saints, which ſhould fall out after the witneſſes <hi>finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:005185_0368_1016DD7EF0601820"/>
their teſtimony,</hi> who had ſo long in an abject low condition, as in ſackcloth, prophecied; yea, when Antichriſt ſhould be at his height, and his Kingdom upon the turn, that then muſt this remarkable <hi>killing of the witneſſes</hi> be accompliſhed: ſo likewiſe did the <hi>event</hi> convincingly verify the ſame. For it is known that upon the cloſe of <hi>Antichriſt</hi>'s reign, whilſt the truth began to break out, this ſoreſt ſtorm of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution beyond all that had been before, did then break upon the Church, even in its budding forth, that we may ſay, that adverſary did not only put forth the utmoſt of his power and rage againſt the Saints, but ſeemed in ſome meaſure to bring his cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to paſs; which the dreadful maſſacres in <hi>France, Provence,</hi> and the Valleys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> the ſore and violent perſecution of the Church thro' the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi> after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> can clearly witneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is it not alſo clear, how this remarkable <hi>ſtorm,</hi> and cutting down of the Saints, over whoſe dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies their adverſaries did rejoice, was according to this prophecy to be <hi>previous</hi> to ſome eminent <hi>enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>reviving</hi> of the Church, which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly fall out in the event, like a <hi>reſurrection of the witneſſes</hi> from the dead, to the aſtoniſhment of the World, that immediately followed upon the back thereof? ſo that when their enemies thought they had gained their end, as they did conclude by ſuch perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, particularly that <hi>French maſſacre,</hi> that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> intereſt ſhould be quite ruined, they were yet forced to ſee their labour in vain, and the Church more eminently flouriſhing after the ſame.</p>
               <p>I ſhall further add, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> hath not only been <hi>revealed,</hi> and his Kingdom come to its height: but it is clear this day, that it is on the <hi>falling</hi> hand, and
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:005185_0369_1016DD374BC78C78"/>
his <hi>ruin</hi> is now begun. Upon which account we may ſay, yea, have cauſe to ſing, that <hi>the winter is paſt, the fig-tree putteth forth her leaves,</hi> that ſheweth the ſummer's approach; yea, the <hi>ſinging of birds is heard in our land:</hi> let us go forth, and meet him, who is now gone out as a mighty man, for the ſalvation of his Church, and takes the fields againſt this great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of his truth and people, on whoſe ſide victory doth ſurely wait.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing propoſed, was to conſider,—WHAT IS YET TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.</p>
               <p>Having touched a little ſome of the moſt concerning prophecies of the Scripture, both under the New and Old Teſtament, which are <hi>already</hi> fulfilled, and the truth thereof ſo clearly written forth in the hiſtory of providence; that we may ſay, the moſt ordinary obſervers, if they will not ſhut their eyes, cannot want a conviction thereof: I ſhall now in the next place point at that which yet <hi>remaineth</hi> of the prophetical part of the Scripture, to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; thoſe prophecies which concern the Church in theſe <hi>laſt times.</hi> Whereby we may have a ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, how <hi>far the night is ſpent,</hi> and of the near <hi>approach</hi> of that bleſſed <hi>day</hi> of the <hi>liberty of the ſons of God:</hi> for this doth <hi>finiſh the myſtery of God,</hi> and fully prefecteth his work, if once that which remaineth of the prophecies of the word were fulfilled.</p>
               <p>There are thoſe truths, the accompliſhment where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have a ſure warrant to expect <hi>before the end.</hi> As (1.) The full ruin, and downfal of <hi>Babylon.</hi> (2.) The converſion and incalling of the <hi>Jews</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt.—(3.) A ſolemn day of the Church's flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the making out of the former promiſe. (4.) The
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:005185_0370_1016DD822EB34AB0"/>
fall and deſtruction of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire, that cruel party who have been raiſed up and eſtabliſhed for judgment, with whom the Lord ſhall yet rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon, for all that Chriſtian blood by them ſo unjuſtly ſhed, as ſeemeth clearly held forth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12. (5.) We are alſo to expect, after all theſe, that full and laſt ſtroke upon <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog:</hi> and then <hi>the Lord is at hand,</hi> and that great <hi>myſtery</hi> of the prophecies and promiſes of the Scripture ſhall then be <hi>finiſhed,</hi> and at a bleſſed cloſe.</p>
               <p>I. We have <hi>the full ruin and deſtruction of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt and his Kingdom,</hi> clearly propheſied, and in very expreſs terms promiſed to the Church (2 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. 2, 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 10, <hi>and</hi> 17.) the accompliſhment whereof we do yet according to the Scripture wait for; which the God of truth, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie or repent, ſhall in due time aſſuredly bring about, and which approacheth when that ſolemn cry ſhall be heard, <hi>Babylon is fallen!</hi> about which we would conſider,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this judgment is <hi>already begun,</hi> and the firſt ſtep thereof viſible is now clear; wherein men may ſee the event moſt exactly anſwer the prophecy. For the Lord hath begun to <hi>conſume Antichriſt by the breath of his mouth:</hi> and ſince the firſt breaking out of the light, his Kingdom hath been moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down before the Word. Have not Nations fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len off, at the voice of the preached Goſpel? It is true, the Church wanteth not ſore conflicts, even under the <hi>Vials:</hi> and it is the Lord's way, to try his People with ſuch various uncertainties, that when things have been moſt promiſing, another providence cometh like a croſs wave, which ſeemeth to drive them as far back, as once they ſeemed to be forward. Yet it is ſure, and ſhould be beyond debate, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's overthrow is upon a preſent <hi>advance,</hi> and that
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:005185_0371_1016DD38F6F580F8"/>
work of the Lord for his Church's deliverance is going forward. For if we believe ſalvation by Chriſt upon the warrant of the word, ſhould we not alſo with much aſſurance believe that Antichriſt's wound is deadly and incurable, which he hath got by the preaching of the Goſpel, which all the Phyſicians of the earth ſhall never help.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is one of the <hi>greateſt</hi> and moſt <hi>ſignal</hi> acts of the judgment of God on his Church's enemies; one of the moſt eminent manifeſtations of his glory, which he hath reſerved for <hi>the laſt times,</hi> wherein the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of his hand and great power ſhall be very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; and we are to expect by this remarkable ſtroke that way ſhall be made for that <hi>glorious houſe,</hi> which Chriſt is to have for himſelf in the latter days, which ſhall be built upon Antichriſt's ruins, when that <hi>new bride,</hi> both of Jews and Gentiles, ſhall be prepared for the <hi>marriage-ſupper of the Lamb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Though we are to expect, on clear ground from the word, <hi>the Lord's eminent appearing by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate hand in this great work,</hi> which ſhall be ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing in that day, and witneſs an extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that all lookers-on muſt with fear and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment confeſs, that this is God's own work: yet it is alſo clear, that <hi>he will therein make uſe of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> fitted and choſen for that end, who ſhall be raiſed and acted forth with a more than ordinary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to <hi>execute the vengeance of the Lord, even the judgment written:</hi> amongſt whom <hi>the feeble</hi> ſhall then be <hi>ſtrong.</hi> Yea, we have ground to expect, that of the <hi>Kings</hi> of the earth, and the race and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of thoſe who in former times had <hi>given their power to the Beaſt,</hi> ſhall the Lord raiſe up, to <hi>hate the whore, and make her deſolate.</hi> O bleſſed are they, who ſhall have a hand in ſo noble a work, to ſack and deſtroy that accurſed City, built up with the blood of the Saints and martyrs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="337" facs="unknown:005185_0372_1016DD86531F0CD0"/>
4. We are not to <hi>bound the Lord,</hi> as to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>time</hi> for accompliſhing this piece of his word: yet, we have clear ground to believe, that <hi>Babylon's ruin maketh haſte,</hi> and <hi>the day of the Lord upon her is near;</hi> whoſe <hi>ſword is bathed in Heaven,</hi> and that the inſtruments of his vengeance are making ready. One ſtroke upon that party is already paſt; Antichriſt hath begun to fall before the word, and muſt fall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther until that great ſtroke, which ſhall deſtroy his ſeat and lay waſte that land, be accompliſhed. Some promiſing evidences of its near approach I would here point at. (1.) The many <hi>prayers</hi> of the ſaints, which are now before the throne, and cannot ſail of a return. Many who wreſtled oft with the Lord on this account, though they are gone, yet are their prayers on the file, and wait for this ſolemn mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the judgment of God: and the <hi>blood</hi> of the Saints doth not ceaſe to <hi>cry,</hi> yea, hath as loud a cry as ever.—(2.) It is clear, that the <hi>preached Goſpel</hi> now ſince the light began to break forth, doth ripen and help to make the <hi>harveſt</hi> more <hi>white,</hi> than many ages formerly. And truly, if we conſider how long the word hath been ſounding a retreat to that party, to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that for theſe 150 years they have been ſtill acting in oppoſition to ſo clear a light, to ſuch a ſolemn call, ſo many warnings, yea, to ſuch convincing diſcovery of the Lord's being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them in very remarkable providences, doth it not ſhew, at what an height their ſin this day is, and an obſtinate rejecting of cure?—(3.) We cannot but ſee how that judgment which ſhould be poured forth on Antichriſt under the <hi>vials,</hi> is in a great meaſure now verified in the event.—(4.) It is clear, and conſonant to the Scripture, that the Lord's <hi>work</hi> is now <hi>haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the latter days, providence in a ſwift motion and making great advance, more quick changes in the caſe of the Church, both as to ſtorms and calms,
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:005185_0373_1016DD3D27BBFB58"/>
and her trials now muſt not be ſo long as in former time. <hi>Rom</hi> 9. 28. <hi>He will out ſhort his work in righteouſneſs; for a ſhort work will the Lord make in the earth.</hi>—(5.) That <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his followers do this day ſeem to be at ſuch an <hi>advantage;</hi> the Lord's work as it were at a ſtand, yea, rather going back. This late reviving of Antichriſtian Prelacy in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with ſo viſible a growth of Popery there, and ſo dark an hour upon the reformed Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, I think, on very ſolid grounds, is a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing evidence of the near approach of a further ſtroke on that party. For it is clear, both from the word and God's ordinary way of procedure, how a ſharp <hi>ſtorm</hi> is uſually <hi>previous</hi> to ſome remarkable <hi>enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the Church; a very low ebb, before the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the tide; yea, that every ſtep of her advance, whereby ſhe hath gained ground on Antichriſt, hath ſtill had ſome conflict and wreſtling going before: and thus the Lord, by ſuffering, doth ripen his People for ſuch times of mercy. For which times, O let us pray and wait, when the ſmoke of that accurſed City ſhall aſcend up to Heaven, and his People be made to triumph in his praiſe, and ſing that ſong, <hi>Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and honour to the Lord God, who hath judged the great whore! Rejoyce over her, thou Heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets: for God hath avenged you upon her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. We have a clear prophecy about <hi>the incalling of the Jews,</hi> and their converſion to Chriſt in the latter days, held forth by the prophets, and in the New Teſtament very expreſly mentioned; the fulfilling whereof the Church muſt yet wait for, and long after, when God ſhall <hi>bring again the captivity</hi> of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient People, and ſay to that <hi>valley of dry bones. Live!</hi> about which we would conſider, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 11. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="339" facs="unknown:005185_0374_1016DD87DEDCC5A8"/>
1. That this promiſe doth not only concern par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, or a few, but the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of that people, is moſt clear from the Scripture, if men would compare <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 11. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25. Where it is undeniable, that their <hi>gathering</hi> muſt be as full and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as their <hi>ſcattering:</hi> and as there is no nation ſo <hi>remote</hi> whither ſome of them are this day driven, <hi>that</hi> ſhall not hinder the fulfilling of the promiſe; but as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſheweth, <hi>the Lord ſhall then aſſemble the diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and outcaſts, and bring them back from the four corners of the earth,</hi> and furtheſt places thereof. Yea, doth not the Apoſtle expreſly ſhew, that it is <hi>all Iſrael,</hi> whereat this promiſe pointeth? For <hi>though they are enemies concerning the Goſpel, yet are they beloved for the fathers ſakes,</hi> becauſe of the Covenant which was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed. And truly we have in this, ground alſo to expect ſomething further than their converſion; that in this day the Lord ſhall <hi>raiſe up the tabernacle of David which is fallen,</hi> and plant them upon their own land, <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 11, 15. Not only bring them to a viſible Church-ſtate, but even therewith ſome temporal reſtitution and recollection of them as a <hi>Nation:</hi> yea, we may expect a return of the old bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that land's <hi>fruitfulneſs,</hi> which I think is clearly held forth in that of <hi>Amos.</hi> 9 14. that the very <hi>hills ſhall drop down ſweet wine,</hi> and melt as it were in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bleſſings on them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this promiſe hath <hi>not yet</hi> had an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, is alſo clear from the Word. For it muſt follow the rejection of that People, and ſhould not take place until <hi>the fulneſs of the gentiles be brought in:</hi> which harveſt for many ages after was not to be reaped. Yea, did not the Apoſtle hold this forth as a <hi>myſtery,</hi> a piece of the Scripture which the ancient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church could not well comprehend, when it
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:005185_0375_1016DD400B202118"/>
was pointed at Prophets, and even at that time was not underſtood? Which ſurely could have been no <hi>myſtery,</hi> if their converſion had reached no further then the Apoſtles time; and it is known, how ſmall a number ſince of that People hath yet been brought into Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have much ground from the Scripture, that this day, this great day of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> ſhall be a very <hi>remarkable</hi> and <hi>ſolemn</hi> time: which will cauſe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the <hi>Nations</hi> round about, &amp; make a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change on the face of the earth; a time of God's eminent appearance for that People, when his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reſpect ſhall be as manifeſt, as formerly his great diſpleaſure and anger was; a time, on which many of the choiceſt mercies of the Church do certainly wait, the return of many prayers, a large <hi>pouring forth of the Spirit,</hi> even on the body of that People and on all ranks, not only the families of <hi>David Nathan,</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> but alſo the families of <hi>Shimei,</hi> with a large Diſpenſation of gifts; yea, ſuch a time, wherein the converted of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall then ſee and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how far <hi>the glory of the ſecond Temple</hi> doth <hi>exceed that of the firſt,</hi> and ſhall be a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous part of Chriſt's univerſal Kingdom, eminent for the power and purity of the ordinances, to which others ſhall look as to a moſt choice and excellent pattern of a purely reformed and glorious Church.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Beſide the promiſe of him, who is not like man to lie, or the ſon of man, to repent, there want not ſome very convincing <hi>providences,</hi> to confirm our faith concerning this: if we conſider how this People are ſtill <hi>kept by themſelves,</hi> amidſt all their ſcatterings not mixt or incorporated with other Nations, which is moſt uſual thro' long converſe, that people of ſeveral parts of the earth will unite &amp; join in one. Is not their great <hi>increaſe</hi> alſo remarkable? What great multitudes of them are in the eaſtern parts, yea, through moſt of
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:005185_0376_1016DD898AF38338"/>
                  <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and in thoſe places of <hi>Europe</hi> where the Chriſtian Church is? &amp; all this time their land not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, but by a rabble of the <hi>Turks,</hi> under whoſe yoke they groan. And though the <hi>genealogies</hi> of particular families are at this day much loſt, yet there is ſtill ſo much ſure and evident, as to the ſeries and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy of the Nation, that doth <hi>difference</hi> them from any other People.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is true, the authority of the word ſhould ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence all our thoughts <hi>how</hi> ſo great a thing ſhall be brought about: yet we may judge, that (as a mean) <hi>this</hi> ſhall eminently contribute to the ſame, ſuch a convincing <hi>ſtroke upon Antichriſt</hi> which muſt go before their converſion, wherein ſo manifeſt an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of God, and the fulfilling of one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt promiſes of the New Teſtament, cannot but ſtare them in the face; and with this the taking away of that ſtumbling block of <hi>idolatry,</hi> which hath ſo long helpt to harden them againſt the profeſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>I muſt ſhut up this with a ſad regret that whilſt we have ſo clear a promiſe, there is no more tender reſpect, and further eſſay to promote the good of that People. Who knoweth, what a bleſſing might attend the uſe of ordinary means? ſince this is an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable duty, and men know not, when they <hi>ſow the ſeed, whether this or that ſhall proſper,</hi> alas! that the uſual deportment of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> with whom they converſe, doth oft further help to highten their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt Chriſtianity; let us long and pray more for this day, a day which ſhall bring ſo great a bleſſing with it to the <hi>gentiles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. There are many prophecies both in the Old and New Teſtament, that do clearly point at <hi>a great flouriſhing &amp; proſperity in the days of the Goſpel:</hi> which I humbly conceive, are not yet fully made out, but
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:005185_0377_1016DD42D0EBA658"/>
ſhall have a more remarkable accompliſhment before the cloſe of time. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65. 25. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66. 12. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, the event will be the ſureſt commentary; and until this appear, men ſhould be ſober and cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that they <hi>darken not the counſel of God,</hi> and his truth, with any wild fancy, and aim to be <hi>wiſe above that which is written:</hi> yet I muſt think, that there are <hi>great things laid up</hi> in theſe promiſes for the <hi>Church,</hi> that we cannot now well reach; yea, would ſcarce get believed, until the appointed time unvail their meaning. I ſhall here but only touch how it may appear theſe promiſes are <hi>not yet</hi> fully accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, and <hi>what</hi> with a ſafe warrant we may expect in their accompliſhment. As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> we would conſider theſe things,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That theſe great promiſes, which hold forth ſo eminent an enlargement and flouriſhing of the Church, do alſo point at ſome <hi>particular limited time;</hi> ſome period and revolution of the Church's condition, which is not agreeable and common to other times; until which theſe promiſes do not take place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This promiſed flouriſhing concerneth both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the word doth clearly point at ſome further encreaſe of the <hi>gentile</hi> Church by the calling of the <hi>Jews:</hi> which muſt have a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to that ſolemn time of <hi>Iſrael's</hi> reſtoration, and <hi>Antichriſt's</hi> ruin; a time, on which the return of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers, and the fulfilling of many promiſes in the behalf of the Church, do ſurely wait. So that as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and other of the Prophets do put over this great flouriſhing of the Church to the days of the Goſpel, the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. doth point at a more preciſe time, wherein this in a larger meaſure ſhall be made out.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We cannot find the <hi>Chriſtian Church did ever</hi>

               <p n="4">4. It would appear, ſo ſolemn a time of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches flouriſhing, whereat the <hi>Prophets</hi> did ſo oft point, as it hath an undoubted reſpect to the days of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſo in its full accompliſhment muſt <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi> to that remarkable day of <hi>Satan's binding</hi> and the <hi>Saints Reign with Chriſt,</hi> when <hi>the Kingdoms of the Earth become the Lord'</hi>s; which we find doth immediately preceed <hi>Satan</hi>'s laſt <hi>looſing,</hi> and his going forth to gather his broken forces, for that <hi>great battel,</hi> which is to be very near <hi>the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall but add, we have ground to judge, the Lord will uſher in that glorious everlaſting ſtate of the Church, even by ſome <hi>preparative degrees</hi> here: the <hi>latter</hi> times are there to be reckoned the more bleſſed, the more near they approach to the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of glory.</p>
               <p>Now, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, I ſhall but point at <hi>ſome things,</hi> which with a ſafe warrant we may underſtand and look after <hi>in the accompliſhment of theſe promiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very clear, they hold forth a great enlargement to the <hi>univerſal</hi> Church, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Particular Churches may be in a ſad withering condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whilſt other parts do flouriſh: but theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſeem to point at a day, which will concern the ſaints in all corners of the earth, who ſhall not want their ſhare with the reſt of that bleſſed time.

be alſo clear, ſome more <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>hot ſun-ſhine of the Goſpel</hi> is held forth; ſome ſuch remarkable <hi>ſpring-tide of the Spirit,</hi> that ſhall be as diſcernable, as the Churches low ebb ſometimes was; a day of the <hi>great power of God,</hi> his preſence very manifeſt among his people and with the ordinances, beyond former times; ſo that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. 35. <hi>The name of that place ſhall be called</hi> Jehovah Shammah, <hi>the Lord is there.</hi> Yea, that in this day Chriſt's <hi>viſible</hi> Kingdom, in a <hi>ſetled Church-ſtate,</hi> ſhall more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently <hi>flouriſh:</hi> and the flowing in of people and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with much fervour, who ſhall <hi>joyn themſelves to the Lord,</hi> pure ordinances, a more univerſal oneneſs amongſt the worſhippers of God, the walk of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with a diſcernable luſtre of holineſs, will be made to commend the Goſpel; <hi>Chriſt's goings</hi> full of Majeſty, and <hi>the ſhout of a King</hi> which then ſhall be heard among his People; the noiſe of ſuch ſad complaints and bitter exerciſes from the ſpirit of bondage, not ſo much among the ſaints, as in former times.

(¶) IV. There is a ſpecial prediction of <hi>Satan's binding up,</hi> or reſtraint, and of ſome remarkable <hi>reign of the Church with Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> held forth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 2. The full accompliſhment of which we on clear ground may judge, is not already come: yet is ſo far now verified in the event, as may clearly witneſs its meaning, and let us ſee how at this day it is taking place. I confeſs, this ſeems one of the moſt dark and abſtruſe propheſies, we have in the Scripture; on which there hath been many ſtrange thoughts and gloſſes held forth: but to ſet down theſe various judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men on the truths of God, I humbly think, may tend to a further darkning of the ſame, more than to any ſolid edification. I ſhall only offer ſome things to be conſidered, which by undeniable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from the Scripture ſeem moſt clear and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, and may only help to the underſtanding this Propheſie, but that manifeſt correſpondence which is betwixt it and the event at this day.</p>
               <p>(1.) There can be no debate, this ſolemn time of the <hi>Saints reign with Chriſt</hi> concerns the <hi>militant</hi> condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, and muſt be expected here on the <hi>earth,</hi> not in heaven. And therefore we find imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after, there is a very ſore aſſault of the <hi>Devil</hi> held forth, who ſhould occaſion a new trial to the Church; and he for a time let <hi>looſe,</hi> to <hi>deceive the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>—(2.) Since the Scripture is the beſt interpreter of it ſelf, we muſt here underſtand (comparing one place with another) this raiſing of the Saints and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Jeſus Chriſt to reign with him, <hi>figuratively,</hi> and in ſuch a ſenſe as that is <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 11. muſt be underſtood; to wit, a riſing of the witneſſes in the <hi>ſame ſpirit and power,</hi> and of ſuch a party who ſhould bear the <hi>ſame teſtimony.</hi> To which alſo that in <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 5. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 14. about <hi>John's</hi> coming in the ſame Spirit of <hi>Elijah,</hi> with which he did appear to the World, gives light. So that we ſee how conſonant and
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:005185_0381_1016DD4A1ABD94C0"/>
agreeable the Scripture is with it ſelf. (3.) Is not the meaning of the Spirit in this propheſy clear, that the <hi>greateſt enlargement</hi> of the Church, yea, &amp; of the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt duration and continuance, that it ſhould have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament unto the ſecond coming of Chriſt, is held forth in the <hi>reign of the ſaints?</hi> So that it manifeſtly points at a more ſolemn time, a more ſweet refreſhing interval, which ſhall be remarkable both in meaſure and duration beyond all ſhe formerly had: and ſhews, that there is no ſuch happy time elſe to go over the Church's head, till ſhe be <hi>trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi> in heaven. Therefore it is called, by way of eminence, the Church's reign, conſidered <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> with any other ſuch change. (4.) Is it not very clear, that this ſo remarkable time cannot be judged <hi>previous</hi> to <hi>Antichriſt's</hi> coming, nor <hi>under</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and growth? Since, firſt, this points expreſly at thoſe who were <hi>beheaded for the witneſs of Chriſt,</hi> and had <hi>not worſhiped the beaſt and his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> nor <hi>received his mark,</hi> who ſhould thus be raiſed to reign with Chriſt.—(2.) We find that it doth very immediately preceed that <hi>laſt aſſault</hi> the Church ſhall have, upon <hi>Satan's looſing,</hi> to gather the nations to that <hi>great battel,</hi> and ſo muſt concern theſe <hi>laſt times,</hi> when the Lord is pouring out his <hi>vials</hi> upon the throne and Kingdom of the <hi>beaſt.</hi> It is ſtrange, when the Scripture is ſo plain, that ſome choice and excellent men, writing on this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy, will have it contemporary with the Church's condition <hi>before</hi> Antichriſt's appearance: for it is ſure if by <hi>the beaſt and his image and mark,</hi> Antichriſt muſt be underſtood, and if there be but <hi>one</hi> great aſſault mentioned <hi>after</hi> this, which the Church militant ſhall have before the cloſe of time, this propheſie muſt <hi>now</hi> be fulfilling, and with no other time before this could quadrate, according to the Scripture.—(5.) Is it not clear, that this great reſtraint of <hi>Satan</hi> is no ſuch
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:005185_0382_1016DD924CE87950"/>
                  <hi>abſolute</hi> binding, that will put the Church wholly beyond trouble and reach of his aſſaults? No, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to <hi>heaven,</hi> and is there only to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But the Scripture very evidently ſhew's, this ſhall be ſuch a <hi>binding up of Satan,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>not deceive the nations,</hi> nor have that wonted power to darken the face of the Church by any great or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal apoſtacy, during this time. And I am ſure, it is undeniable, that ſince the Church's raiſing from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Antichriſt, Satan hath been thus reſtrained: &amp; by all his violent aſſaults, he hath not reached the <hi>full</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of any one <hi>nation,</hi> which was brought under the yoke of the Goſpel; whatever may be ſaid of poor <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by a violent courſe of perſecution ſo born down, that this once famous Church is now ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in other places where there are yet conſiderable numbers, yea, it is not altogether without hope, that the great avenger of blood will yet viſit her cruel uſage on that bloody <hi>Auſtrian</hi> family, and return yet her captivity again, when it ſeems now furtheſt off and hopeleſs.—(6.) Muſt we not ſee, that this great ſunſhine, as it takes in <hi>Antichriſt's</hi> fall, hath a ſpecial reſpect alſo to <hi>Iſrael's</hi> return and converſion? Which, according to the Scripture, is one of the moſt ſolemn and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times that the Chriſtian Church ſhall have, and therefore ſhall be to the <hi>gentiles</hi> as <hi>life from the dead.</hi> Now, do but ſeriouſly judge what the Church's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>hath been</hi> through all the times of the New Teſtament, firſt under <hi>Heathens,</hi> and after under the tyranny of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and now how far providence does unfold the meaning of this prophecy in the event, ſince the <hi>man of ſin</hi> began to decline; and I humbly judge, it may be eaſy to ſee, that at <hi>this day</hi> it is clearly <hi>taking place,</hi> though this ſolemn <hi>reign</hi> be not yet advanced to its greateſt pitch, but will have a more remarkable period ere this prophecy be fully made out. I ſhall but add, this <hi>reſurrection</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:005185_0383_1016DD4BA6D8C360"/>
in the prophecy, muſt be in a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſenſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and can be no bodily raiſing of the Saints; ſince it is ſo expreſly there called <hi>the firſt reſurrection,</hi> to difference it from the ſecond, and is held forth in an oppoſition to the firſt death. (¶)</p>
               <p>VI. We have a prophecy held forth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16. 12. which compared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 13. ſeemeth clearly to point at <hi>the fall and deſtruction of the</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh <hi>Empire,</hi> who have been theſe many ages ſo great a ſcourge to the Chriſtian World. For it's manifeſt, that this <hi>drying up of the river Euphrates</hi> muſt relate to the very party, which we find in that 9<hi>th Chap.</hi> raiſed up from about that river, where the <hi>Turk</hi> hath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a part of his dominions. It is true, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent will more clearly make this known: Yet theſe Things are undeniable,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>ſuch a Party</hi> was foretold by <hi>John,</hi> in that 9th Ch. and a ſolemn warning given to the Church, of ſo dreadful a ſtorm; the <hi>time</hi> alſo there pointed forth, when <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhould be at a great height; yea, the <hi>portr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icture</hi> of ſuch an adverſary moſt evidently held forth, ſuch as indeed they were found to be, a <hi>terrible cruel deſtroying</hi> party, and therefore are ſaid to have <hi>breaſt-plates of fire;</hi> their <hi>number</hi> alſo there held out to be a <hi>very great multitude,</hi> which thoſe huge armies uſually brought by the <hi>Turk</hi> to the field, can witneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>cauſe</hi> why the Lord ſhould raiſe up ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an enemy, and thus let them looſe, is alſo expreſly declared in that 9th Chap. 20th ver. that it was in judgment, and for a plague on men, for <hi>Antichriſtian idolatry,</hi> which then had ſo much overſpread the earth; and it was no wonder, when ſo much of the viſible Church was turned almoſt brutiſh in their Religion, and from the pure worſhip of God was carried after idols of gold and ſilver, the work of
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:005185_0384_1016DD954EF210A8"/>
men's hands, that ſo brutiſh and barbarous an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſhould be let out for a ſcourge. I truly think, that as <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and the abominations of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hath been hitherto the let of ſucceſs againſt the <hi>Turk;</hi> ſo we are not to expect the proſpering of any ſuch deſign, and his fall and ruin, until the cauſe be removed, for which the Lord did make uſe of this dreadful rod.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſuch a party was raiſed up, according to the <hi>prophecy,</hi> yea, at the appointed time thereof, is very clear, who like a <hi>mighty deluge</hi> did overthrow a great part of the earth, and with ſtrange prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſucceſs did over-run much of <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſome parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and brake in on <hi>Europe,</hi> to give work to thoſe <hi>kings</hi> and <hi>great men,</hi> and be a ſcourge to them, who had <hi>given their power</hi> to uphold the throne of the <hi>Beaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. There is alſo clear ground from the Scripture, that the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall as eminently appear in the <hi>fall</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> of this adverſary, as in the raiſing of them up; and that by <hi>their fall,</hi> he is to make way for the accompliſhing of his promiſe, about the <hi>Church's</hi> further <hi>increaſe,</hi> his ancient people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this prophecy ſeems to have a particular reſpect. This we are to look for, as one of the great works of the Lord, that is reſerved for the <hi>latter days,</hi> which ſhall no leſs ſhew forth his power and glory, <hi>even the drying up of that great Euphrates,</hi> than in the day that he divided the ſea, and made <hi>Jordan</hi> a dry channel for his people to go through. We are not to be further poſitive about means and inſtruments, how ſuch a thing ſhall be brought about: it is enough, what the Lord hath ſpoken; and the word that is gone out of his mouth, ſhall <hi>not return empty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VII. Now to cloſe this, there is yet one <hi>great aſſault,</hi> which we find the Church ſhall have <hi>before
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:005185_0385_1016DD4EF886EE98"/>
the end,</hi> and then <hi>her warfare</hi> will be near <hi>finiſhed:</hi> about which the Scripture is clear, that <hi>Satan</hi> for a little time muſt be <hi>let looſe,</hi> and that ſolemn and perfect <hi>victory,</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> in the cloſe of time will get over all her adverſaries, ſhall be uſhered in with a very ſharp trial, &amp; once again this <hi>ungodly World</hi> will ſhew its <hi>rage,</hi> rally its broken ſcattered forces, in a general muſter (<hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 8.) with as much fury as ever: and then ſhall the <hi>Lord</hi> eminently appear, that by one full ſtroke he may for ever decide that long continued war and feud betwixt the Church and her enemies. A deliverance, which as it will be the laſt, ſo one of the greateſt that ever the Church had; the Lord thus finiſhing his work of providence, by ſo ſtately and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a cloſe? And truly, after this, we know no more of Canonick Scripture to be fulfilled, but the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord,</hi> when the poor, toſt, afflicted Church ſhall enter into a <hi>triumphant</hi> eſtate, above all the violence &amp; oppreſſion of men. O bleſſed, &amp; long looked for day of Chriſt's return to judgment, when <hi>the duſt of the Saints,</hi> that for ſome thouſand years paſt have been <hi>reſting in hope,</hi> ſhall <hi>awake;</hi> and this earth and all the glory thereof, like a poor vain ſhew, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear! O bleſſed and comfortable time, in which the ſaints ſhall then fully know what <hi>Heaven</hi> is, which they have ſo oft admired at a diſtance! ſhall <hi>behold his face, in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joy!</hi> and ſhall need no further confirmations of the truth of the word, when once this great promiſe of the Lord's return is verified, a promiſe; wherein all thoſe precious truths, which concerned the Church in her journey, as ſo many ſtreams, ſhall empty themſelves in this great deep! Then there is no more to do, the work of the Goſpel is finiſhed, the redeemed all brought in, and the Bride made ready to go forth and meet him, who ſhall fully ſatisfy and comfort his
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:005185_0386_1016DD975BD20E18"/>

(¶) I. Is not <hi>the being of the world, yea, the heavens and the earth which we ſee,</hi> with the continued courſe of nature, <hi>given from the Lord,</hi> and held forth, to his people, as a <hi>witneſs</hi> to his truth, and a ſure <hi>pledge</hi> to confirm their faith of its accompliſhment?

We have this clear, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 20. that <hi>the Covenant with the day and the night</hi> is there given to the Church to confirm that Covenant betwixt the Lord &amp; his people. This alſo is held forth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 35. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, who giveth the ſun for a light by day, and the moon &amp; ſtars by night, if theſe ordinances ſhall depart, then may the ſeed of Iſrael ceaſe and fail from being a nation.</hi> It is alſo clear, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89. 2. <hi>That the faithfulneſs of God is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the very heavens;</hi> and theſe given as a ſpecial convincing pledge, to confirm the faith of his people in the matter of his truth, and of the performance of his word: for which, we will find in <hi>ver.</hi> 37<hi>th</hi> of that <hi>Pſalm</hi> the <hi>ſun</hi> and <hi>moon</hi> given to the Church as a <hi>witneſs.</hi> Is not the <hi>rainbow</hi> alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.

               <p>I muſt think it ſtrange, that we do not conſider <hi>this world,</hi> and look on the frame thereof with more aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment, yea, that it is not a greater and more marvellous thing in our eyes, if we would but think ſeriouſly, <hi>Whence</hi> it is, and how i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Something which muſt be <hi>previouſly</hi> known and believed, that thoſe viſible <hi>heavens</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> are the very work and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>this God,</hi> whoſe word and promiſe we have in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and have their being and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from him: for otherwiſe there could be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning from theſe, about the truth of his word. (2.) We ſhould alſo conſider, what a convincing <hi>pledge</hi> is here, for confirming our faith of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and of the ſure performance of all that is yet remaining thereof to be accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> it might ſeem unneceſſary ſo much as once to mention it, ſince it is ſo little queſtioned, or under debate; but oh<hi>!</hi> it is too clear, that many truths are eaſily admitted, which are not really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. I know the world would find it hard to ſhift ſo manifeſt a demonſtration, that this <hi>univerſe</hi> is the work and product of the <hi>great God,</hi> when there is in it ſo bright a diſcovery of infinite <hi>power</hi> and <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> Truly it is ſtrange, how men could admit its being, who have denied its beginning, which not only <hi>by Faith we underſtand,</hi> but is moſt evident from ſolid grounds of <hi>reaſon:</hi> And though men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done with implicit faith and a common aſſent to the greateſt fundamental truths, without any ſolid perſwaſion thereof, yet the greateſt Atheiſts cannot keep off the diſcovery of this, but by keeping at a diſtance from it. Which truly <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and others of thoſe ancients did not ſo much deny the ſame, but <hi>not knowing the Scripture</hi> they could not know how it ſhould be. Thence <hi>Epicurus</hi> and others of his followers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that they could not ſolve the <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>

of nature, and ſhun unanſwerable abſurdities, if they admitted an <hi>eternity</hi> of the world, did fall on ſuch an irrational fancy, to avoid this, of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous concourſe of atoms;</hi> yea, ſome held an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal praeexiſtence of the <hi>firſt matter:</hi> which pitiful no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may ſhew what ſad caſe men are in, who grope after the truth by the twilight of nature, and are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Scripture. But I leave this, and ſhall only touch a little ſome moſt clear and ſatisfying evidences of this truth, that the beginning and original of the world is not more clear from the Scripture, then it is alſo demonſtrable from ſolid convincing grounds of reaſon. And truly a clear, diſcovery of this hath a further reach, than may be apprehended, to give the Atheiſm of men a deadly ſtroke, and ſhake all its grounds. Now let theſe few things be ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, (1.) If you confeſs there <hi>is</hi> a Deity, that <hi>God bleſſed for ever</hi> is, muſt you not neceſſarily admit a <hi>creation</hi> and <hi>beginning?</hi> ſince eternity is a thing, that is only communicable to the firſt cauſe: and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive that the earth could produce it ſelf; for to exiſt, &amp; not to exiſt at the ſame time, is a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I am ſure, they muſt ſhut their eyes, who do not every where diſcern ſome witneſs of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious being of God. (2.) You cannot deny, that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>time;</hi> ſince there is no judging days &amp; years &amp; ages to be infinite, or how one thing in a continued order ſhould go before another, without coming to ſome firſt &amp; beginning.—(3) Does not this gradual advance of human <hi>knowledge</hi> in the earth and that further diſcovery which <hi>arts</hi> and <hi>ſciences</hi> have made, by a continued improvement of the ſame, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs very clearly a beginning and original of the world? For ye could not conceive a <hi>perpetual ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of mankind,</hi> with a conſtant eſſay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>further knowledge,</hi> with ſuch a <hi>continued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in experience,</hi> as an <hi>eternity</hi> (ſuppoſed before
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:005185_0390_1016DD9D894CD048"/>
this) would produce, <hi>and yet</hi> the moſt concerning <hi>arts</hi> and <hi>ſciences,</hi> yea, the choiceſt <hi>experiments</hi> and <hi>inventions</hi> we have in the world, to be of ſo <hi>late</hi> a riſe and date; ſuch as the uſe of printing, and of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners compaſs by the load-ſtone, the uſe of guns, the improvement of minerals in Medicine; yea, the very motion and convoy of the blood in man's body; which are but of late diſcovery. (4.) May not ſo <hi>ſhort a hiſtory</hi> which to this day we have of the world, witneſs its <hi>late Original,</hi> and that it is of no eternal duration? ſince the ancienteſt records of time, or of things paſt, do not exceed ſome thouſands of years. And could this be poſſibly conceived, that <hi>infinite</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges preceeding (if ſuch had been) ſhould give <hi>no</hi> account nor leave a remembrance to poſterity, when theſe <hi>late</hi> ages holds ſo <hi>much</hi> forth?

For, if you ſhould this way turn back on an <hi>infinite</hi> number of ages, and ſuppoſe that every age, ſhould but add and multiply to the race of man two or three, it would come at laſt to this, <hi>the earth could not bear them:</hi> ſince we muſt thus ſuppoſe ſome <hi>infinite increaſe,</hi> from an infinite continuance of the world, which no wars or conſuming ſtrokes could in ſuch a meaſure diminiſh.—(9.) Can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>that</hi> ſhould be <hi>eternal,</hi> which is wholly made up of <hi>corruptible</hi> and <hi>periſhing</hi> things? ſince the things of the world have all their ſet times and ſeaſons, wherein they appear, and are quickly gone. In a word, muſt not men deny a <hi>diſſolution</hi> of this world, or an <hi>after-judgment</hi> and <hi>life to come,</hi> yea, the whole truth of religion, if this great truth be not received and believed?</p>

                  </gap> certainly <hi>true,</hi> and muſt have an accompliſhment; ſince from the very being and beginning of the world, we may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reaſon to thoſe things which by undeniable <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> follow.</p>
               <p>(1.) That the world now is, is a ſure and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming witneſs to its <hi>laſt cloſe,</hi> and of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that promiſe of its <hi>diſſolution</hi> in the end of time. We know, it is not long ſince there was no earth, no ſun, moon or ſtars. Now, upon no leſs ſecurity than that word, by which it was formed, we muſt
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:005185_0392_1016DDA010179930"/>
believe it ſhall ere long ceaſe to be what now it is; and thus when we look upon the world, and ſee ſuch a thing before us, ought we not to read that promiſe of its after diſſolution, clearly written thereon before our eyes?—(2.) It is a very clear conſequence, that this God, <hi>can</hi> bring his word unto performance, and his <hi>power</hi> therein cannot fail or fall ſhort; yea, that <hi>his counſel</hi> and purpoſe hath no dependence on <hi>means</hi> or inſtruments, who did once bring this world out of nothing, and ſaid, Let there be heaven and an earth, when there was none. O when we open the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and read the great promiſes thereof, ſhould we not have that impreſſion on our ſouls, <hi>Theſe are the true and faithful ſayings of God,</hi> and <hi>his</hi> word, with whom the <hi>doing</hi> thereof is as eaſie as to <hi>ſay</hi> it; who without the concurrence of inſtruments, or any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers, could bring this great creation forth! We truly ſo far miſtake the meaning of the heavens, and theſe great celeſtial bodies, with the marvellous or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that is there, when we cannot read the truth and faithfulneſs of God in all his promiſes writ thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for they are held forth to men as a confirming <hi>pledge</hi> of the ſame; and this were indeed an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtudy and improvement of Aſtrology.—(3.) Since it is ſure and undeniable, that this <hi>earth doth hang in the empty place,</hi> though men ſee not whereon it leans and reſts, O what a ſtrange thing is it! Could the air bear up ſo vaſt and ponderous a body! But herein is a marvellous divine power convincingly witneſſed, which hath ſo <hi>eſtabliſhed it, that it cannot be moved.</hi> Now, is not this <hi>his</hi> very word, that bears up ſuch a weight? And thence, with as clear ground, we may reaſon for adventuring of the Church with its weight, and every Chriſtian's burden, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be, on the promiſe of this God, on whoſe word the great bulk of the earth doth this day lean. I muſt ſay, no mathematical demonſtration does
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:005185_0393_1016DD5B5B7ACA40"/>
follow by a clearer evidence, than this conſequence from ſuch premiſſes is undenyable.—(4.) We ſee the Lord keeps <hi>covenant</hi> with the <hi>day</hi> and the <hi>night,</hi> yea, that <hi>ſummer</hi> and <hi>winter</hi> do not fail before him, according to his promiſe: and are not theſe a viſible witneſs for God, that his truth and <hi>Covenant with his Church</hi> ſhall not fail? For it is ſure, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued courſe of nature hath ſuch an audible voice, if we could but liſten thereto.—(5.) Does not the Lord clearly witneſs by ſuch a ſtrange <hi>contrariety</hi> that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>elements,</hi> and thoſe <hi>different qualities,</hi> whereof he <hi>ſerves himſelf,</hi> in this great frame and compoſure of the world, that this promiſe ſhall not fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, but it is eaſie for him to verify the ſame, <hi>in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things work together,</hi> were they never ſo <hi>croſs</hi> and <hi>diſagreeing</hi> among themſelves, for an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of his deſign?—(6.) When we ſee the rage and violence of the great <hi>Ocean</hi> bounded by a bank of <hi>ſand;</hi> for which there could be no true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given, how ſuch an impetuous and furious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could be reſtrain'd, and the ſand be a bridle to the ſea, if it were not to make out the faithfulneſs of <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>by a perpetual decree hath thus bounded it;</hi> O is there not thence a viſible confirmation of his truth! that he can alſo <hi>reſtrain the rage of man,</hi> and <hi>turn it unto his praiſe,</hi> and for attaining this end, ſerve himſelf of moſt improbable means. It was a notable ſaying of a grave Miniſter of Chriſt, when he was upon the ſea in a ſtorm, O ſhall I fear (ſays he) the face of a tyrant, that ſerve him who can reſtrain and tame the rage of this ſwelling ſea!—(7) If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>earth</hi> and its original, and look aright on that ſo oft repeated diſcovery we have of the <hi>ſeed-time</hi> and <hi>harveſt,</hi> &amp; of the earth bringing forth ſuch innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kinds of vegetables in the ſpring, after a dead winter, as out of their graves, may we not thence have a very clear confirming ſeal of that great truth

of the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> and of the raiſing of the duſt of men's bodies, that is buried under the earth? I ſhall but ſay, does not God thus give a continued wonder, and ſet the ſame before our eyes in the continued courſe of nature, to aſſure us of his truth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that it ſhall not fail, though there were no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance how in an ordinary way it could be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed? (¶)</p>
               <p>II. Ground, whence we may be thus confirmed in our faith is this; that not only the moſt part of the Scripture is already proved and verified in the event, but alſo <hi>Thoſe truths, which of the whole Scripture are moſt ſtrange and marvellous, yea, would have much ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered our faith, if they were yet ſtill in a promiſe, are this day certainly accompliſhed.</hi> I ſhall but only inſtance in <hi>the coming of the Meſſias,</hi> which the Prophets of old foretold; that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be <hi>manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> and a <hi>virgin</hi> bring forth a <hi>ſon,</hi> whoſe name ſhould be <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> that was to dye and be <hi>cut off of out of the land of the living, not for himſelf, but for the tranſgreſſion of his People:</hi> is not this now ſurely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed? Which, we may ſay, is the greateſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the moſt aſtoniſhing thing that ever was or ſhall be; and ſhould <hi>fully</hi> ſilence our thoughts about any other Scripture-truth, that is yet to be made out. For we know, that the great buſineſs of redemption is put to a cloſe; the ranſome and price thereof fully told down; now is the doctrine of the Goſpel ſealed and atteſted by blood, even the blood of the Teſtator: it is now ſure, the promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> hath come, and this is he, who in the days of <hi>Pilate</hi> ſuffered at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> in whom all things which were written by the Prophets, where truly accompliſhed. And is not this a great pledge, to aſſure us o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

croſs he cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghoſt. O here lieth the greateſt cauſe of wonder; not what doth yet remain of the Scripture, but that which is already fulfilled; not that Chriſt ſhould come again to judge the World, but that once he did come to the World, and become man! For <hi>God</hi> to be found <hi>in the form of a ſervant, and die,</hi> this is beyond expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wonderful: for the other muſt neceſſarily as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

I confeſs, what we do yet expect according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, are great and aſtoniſhing truths, the full overthrow of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his Kingdom, that the dead bones of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church ſhould again live, but ſpecially <hi>Chriſt's</hi> return to <hi>judgment,</hi> who ſhall be <hi>revealed from heaven with flaming fire, the ſound of the trumpet, and voice of the Archangel:</hi> yet, how great ſoever they are, and may ſeem hard for us to believe, O how ſmall comparatively are they with that which is already done and accompliſhed, the <hi>Incarnation of the Son of God,</hi> a myſtery hid from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherein the Angel's with wonder do look! Which, we may ſay, is unſpeakably more great than to create this World, and turn it again to nothing. It may be truly ſtrange, whilſt we read theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies about Chriſt and his Kingdom, in ſo plain an hiſtory, and profeſs that we believe he did die and riſe again, we ſhould have ſuch heſitation about the performance of any other Scripture promiſe. Is it not at this day much more eaſy, to believe the Scripture and fulfilling thereof, than it was of old for the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Church before Chriſt's coming? And now may we not with as much aſſurance wait for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of the Lord, and a full perfecting of his
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:005185_0396_1016DDA5B1CBD168"/>
word, even from that which is already verified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as we are ſure of the return of the ſun after it is gone down, and of the breaking of the day when once the night is paſt!</p>
               <p>III. Ground, whence the godly in theſe times ſhould be confirmed about the full performance of that which is yet remaining of the Scripture, that it is ſure, yea, now nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>This is a grave truth, which might give us very ſweet refreſhing thoughts in ſo ſhaking a time, that whilſt we have ſeen the Lord's appearing by a great and outſtretched hand for his people, have ſeen thoſe terrible ſtirs and concuſſions of the nations, have ſeen him <hi>ſtrike through Kings in the day of his wrath,</hi> and <hi>fill the places with the dead bodies</hi> of his adverſaries, we may alſo on clear Scripture-grounds conclude, that the Lord is now <hi>awaked as a mighty man,</hi> and upon the fields; yea, that the war is ſurely begun againſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and all the adverſaries of his Church, which ſhall not ceaſe until the full vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory be obtained. For indeed thoſe providences which in theſe laſt times ſhould be very affrightning and terrible, when we go into the <hi>word,</hi> we ſhall find they have a <hi>comfortable</hi> aſpect on the <hi>Church,</hi> and do preſage her greater enlargement; as the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der buds and leaves of the fig-tree are put forth to ſhew the ſummer's approach. <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28. It is true, the Church is now low, and the work of God meets with very ſad interruptions, which are needful, both for trial, and rebuke: But this alſo is ſure, which none can deny, that the Lord hath emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently appeared, and <hi>done great things</hi> for his Church;
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:005185_0397_1016DD617087C078"/>
yea, we muſt ſay, he hath by a confluence of very remarkable providences thus condeſcended to ſtrengthen his people's hands, to confirm ſuch who are ready to ſtagger, even as it were by crutches, about the greatneſs of theſe things which are yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
               <p>Now to clear this truth a little, we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, (1.) How it is very conſonant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and expreſly held forth in the ſame, that in the <hi>laſt times,</hi> and turn of the Church's caſe from <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>Lord will thus appear,</hi> in his great ſtrength, and <hi>ſet up his ſtandard</hi> againſt his adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yea, will then in a ſpecial way call forth his people, to glorify him by an active teſtimony. (2) That <hi>the Lord hath thus begun to appear,</hi> according to his word, is a truth that is alſo undeniable; and ſhould much help to confirm our faith, about the performance of that which further remains of the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That the Lord will thus appear in the laſt times,</hi> this is manifeſt from the word. To clear which obſerve, 1. Though the Church militant muſt not want an adverſary, and ſome perſecution from the World, even in her beſt eſtate: Yet we have a ſafe warrant to expect that the Lord will <hi>glorify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> in a peculiar way in his people now in theſe <hi>latter days,</hi> by their <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> for the truth, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages his glory did moſt appear, during <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt's</hi> Reign, in his Church's <hi>ſuffering;</hi> for then <hi>the faith and patience of his Saints</hi> was to be witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in its ſeaſon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 10. And thus he would ſerve himſelf of his people, and bring forth his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, until that time of retribution, when <hi>thoſe who had killed with the ſword, ſhould be killed by the ſword,</hi> and thoſe who <hi>led unto captivity,</hi> be <hi>ſo</hi> dealt with: which doth alſo clearly promiſe ſome ſpecial <hi>out pouring of the Spirit,</hi> for acting with theſe gifts of courage and reſolution, ſutable to the ſervice of the
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:005185_0398_1016DDA870C4D530"/>
Church in the latter days. And truly I think it is a great defect, we ſtudy not more the accompliſhing of the promiſes, and how to improve the ſame, for gifts, as well as grace, in order to the ſeveral times and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is very clear from the Scripture, that in the <hi>laſt days,</hi> when Chriſt is to <hi>raiſe</hi> his Church from under the power and tyranny of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> he ſhall then appear in a <hi>warlike poſture.</hi> Which <hi>John</hi> had ſhewed to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 13, 14. as one at the head of his forces, <hi>with his veſture dipped in blood,</hi> to ſhew when once the war is begun againſt his adverſary, and this <hi>Lion of the tribe of Judah</hi> begins to rouze himſelf up, what a terrible appearance he will have in that undertaking. And it is clear, that the Lord hath declared in this his counſel and will, that his Son <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould in the latter times <hi>take unto himſelf his great power, and reign</hi> (Rev. 11. 17.) yea, cauſe the World to know him to be <hi>Head of principalities and powers,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Church.</hi> For his glory in this truth as a <hi>King,</hi> which former ages ſeemed in ſo great a meaſure to darken, muſt then clearly ſhine forth.

Surely, when we conſider what the Lord <hi>hath</hi> done, and how exactly that doth anſwer the <hi>Scripture,</hi> we may have much to confirm us about the <hi>further</hi> accompliſhment of his word; and be aſſured, that the term of his long ſuffering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Babylon</hi> is at an end, war is denounced, and the execution already begun, which muſt not have a cloſe <hi>until judgment be accompliſhed into vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi>

of the Scripture, yea, that this is near, is this, That <hi>the day is now turned, and that propheſied victory, which the Church ſhould have over Antichriſt before the end, is not only begun, but in a great meaſure advanced.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is indeed a great confirmation, when we ſee ſo marvellous a <hi>criſis</hi> in the Church's caſe, her <hi>recovery</hi> from ſo deſperate and hopeleſs a diſeaſe already <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun,</hi> that it ſhall be further <hi>perfected.</hi> We are apt to wonder at the greatneſs of thoſe things yet <hi>promiſed,</hi> but why ſhould we not alſo wonder at that which God hath <hi>already done</hi> for his Church, in <hi>our</hi> days? The Scripture doth ſhew, that Antichriſt's ruin muſt begin by the word: that this ſtroke ſhall be gradual; and however that great work of God meet with much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, yet it ſhall no more go back in the whole. And muſt we not ſay, in all this the word is fulfilled; it hath not hitherto failed the Church, but the event in every circumſtance is made to anſwer to the ſame?</p>
               <p>Now to clear this, we would conſider theſe two. Firſt, that the <hi>Church's victory</hi> over Antichriſt is <hi>this day</hi> ſo far <hi>advanced.</hi> 2. How the <hi>Lord's</hi> very imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>hand</hi> hath been moſt <hi>diſcernable</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> I need but name, whilſt it is To mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, <hi>what the Lord</hi> hath <hi>wrought for his Church.</hi> For we have ſeen Kingdoms and Nations ſubject themſelves to the truth: the kingdom of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> grow dark, with the breaking out of the light, and many of his followers made to <hi>gnaſh their teeth,</hi> being <hi>ſcorched</hi> with the heat and power of the goſpel; in how great a meaſure is that intereſt now ſhaken, if we conſider what the Lord hath wrought, what a great <hi>reformation</hi> hath been in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> thro' much of <hi>France, Germany, Sweden,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, Poland, Denmark,</hi> yea, even in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania!</hi> Sure this was a great work, which ſhould be marvellous in our eyes, how that <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian

Empire,</hi> contrived with ſuch wiſdom, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derpropt with ſo great ſtrength, whoſe commands not long ſince were received as Oracles, with an awe and reſpect only due to God, hath in ſuch a meaſure begun to fall before the Power of the word! O the <hi>righteous judgment of the Lord,</hi> which he hath ſhewed forth upon that adverſary, and ſhould be a pledge to us of the further manifeſtation thereof; an adverſary, we may ſay, the greateſt that ever the Church had: whoſe <hi>little finger</hi> hath been heavier than the <hi>loins</hi> of all who went before, if we conſider his cruelty over men's bodies, tyranny over their conſciences, with ſo long a continuance of that trial! in reſpect of whom it may be ſaid, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was an eaſy taſk-maſter; <hi>Antiochus</hi> and the Roman Emperors mild, who for near 1200 years did carry on a deſperate and bloody war againſt the Church.</p>
               <p>The ſecond which I would at ſome more length proſecute, is this, <hi>How the Lord's hand and ſomething of an extraordinary providence hath been no leſs diſcernable in this late</hi> raiſing <hi>of the Church, and her begun victory ever Antichriſt, than in the firſt</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>of Chriſtianity by the Apoſtles.</hi> This is a truth, which to many may ſeem ſtrange: but when ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, if prejudice do not darken men's judgment, will appear from ſure and ſolid grounds. Now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate this, I would here offer ſome very <hi>convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> WITNESSES, which may help to ſtrengthen the faith of the Godly, and give Atheiſm ſome daſh.</p>
               <p>FIRST Witneſs to this truth, is <hi>that wonderful ſucceſs which the Goſpel in theſe laſt times hath had:</hi> wherein men muſt ſee the great <hi>power</hi> of God, and efficacy of the Spirit, in ſome meaſure as manifeſt, as in the firſt riſe of the Chriſtian Church, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>

9. I muſt add, that which was as ſore an aſſault to the Church as any, ſo greivous a <hi>difference</hi> which with the firſt breaking out of the work of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did begin betwixt <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> about Chriſt's preſence in the Sacrament; yea, come to ſuch an height and with ſo great heat and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity was followed, as in appearance would have whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruſtrated the work they were about.</p>
               <p>THIRD Witneſs to this truth is <hi>that wonderful patience and reſolution of the Saints, yea, with much chearfulneſs in their greateſt ſufferings, which in theſe late times did appear.</hi> Wherein the world muſt confeſs, that ſame immediate ſupport from Heaven, yea, the Lord's owning his People in a very extraordinary way, was no leſs manifeſt, than in thoſe primitive ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Church from heathens. Sure, no paſt times, even in thoſe bloody days of <hi>Nero! Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> &amp;c. can ſhew more horrid, more ſtrange en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of torment and cruelty, than what in theſe laſt ages the Church did endure from the <hi>Popiſh</hi> party: whoſe ſavage and barbarous uſage of the poor flock of Chriſt, where ever they had acceſs, may witneſs a cruelty more than human. And as to the <hi>number,</hi> are they not almoſt without reckoning, who in <hi>France, Germany, Britain,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> beſide other parts, were ſlain within this 150 years, <hi>for the word of God, and the teſtimony of his truth?</hi> Now, as this is moſt manifeſt, it is alſo known what a divine and an invincible ſpirit, with an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing courage, and reſolution, did appear in the carriage of the People of God, under this ſore perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; how they triumphed over their oppreſſors, and did chearfully meet death in its moſt terrible ſhape; a thing which the Schools of <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Plate</hi> with all their rules could never reach: yea, ſhould be reckoned amongſt the miracles of theſe

latter days. About which we would conſider theſe things.—</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſomething <hi>more than nature,</hi> a ſpirit and reſolution <hi>above</hi> the ordinary rate of <hi>men,</hi> yea, ſome thing much <hi>above themſelves,</hi> their own natural temper and diſpoſition, did in their moſt extream ſufferings oft appear; and this without the leaſt ſhadow of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation, and deceit. I am ſure, the World in theſe laſt ages, yea, the conſcience of their perſecutors, and of the greateſt Atheiſts, muſt witneſs this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That many of the moſt <hi>ſoft</hi> &amp; <hi>tender</hi> diſpoſition, many <hi>women,</hi> whoſe complexion would declare more weakneſs than others, yet in this late <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> perſecution did endure greateſt <hi>torments,</hi> and by ſuffering <hi>triumphed</hi> over the fury and rage of their adverſaries; whereof we have many inſtances upon record.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The World hath been alſo witneſs, how <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>deliberate</hi> the Saints were in this, that they made <hi>ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> their <hi>choice;</hi> which they could eaſily have ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at the rate of yielding ſomething in the truth: but ere they would do this, or give the adverſary ſuch a bribe, they choſe to embrace death, and go to a ſtake for Chriſt, even when they wanted not moſt perſwading offers to turn them aſide. For inſtance, I would here mention that excellent man in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, <hi>Julius Palmer,</hi> who not only had life, but preferment offered, if he would recant; to which his anſwer was, that he had quitted his <hi>living</hi> in two places for Chriſt, and now was ready to yield his <hi>life</hi> alſo on that account. Likewiſe one <hi>William Hunter,</hi> whom Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> did urge with many offers to recant, told him, it muſt be by <hi>Scripture,</hi> and not perſwaſions of that kind; for he reckoned all earthly things but droſs and dung in reſpect of Chriſt; and at the ſtake, when a pardon by the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff was offered upon ſuch an account, did peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:005185_0410_1016DDF5DBB5A0C0"/>
reject the ſame. <hi>Antonius Riceto,</hi> a Venetian, who condemned for the truth had a large offer to have his patrimony reſtored, which was much mortgaged with debt, and made free, beſides his life, if he would but a little yield, and likewiſe had his ſon weeping on him for that cauſe, gave this anſwer, he was reſolved to loſe both Children and eſtate for Chriſt. I ſhall add what we have related of one <hi>Herwin,</hi> who ſuffered in the <hi>Low countries,</hi> to whom the Magiſtrates made great intreaties with large promiſes to recant, which he wholly ſlighted. Many more inſtances of this kind here might be ſet down.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is known, that ſuch who were of <hi>great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute</hi> in the World, and had a <hi>large ſhare of outward things</hi> to tempt them, did in theſe laſt times moſt chearfully <hi>part</hi> with the ſame, and <hi>choſe rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for the truth.</hi> We may inſtance thoſe two great witneſſes, <hi>John Frederick</hi> of <hi>Saxon</hi> and the <hi>Landtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> who under that long impriſonment by <hi>Charles</hi> the 5 bare out many ſharp aſſaults, both by threatnings and offers, without yielding in the leaſt to the prejudice of the truth; yea, on this account did the <hi>Duke of Saxon</hi> forego his eſtate and dignity. <hi>Annas Du Burg,</hi> counſellour of the Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> of great parts and repute, who before <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the II. had an excellent ſpeech in Parliament, for the Proteſtant party, for which by him being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, did forego all his honours and intereſts in the World (which otherways he might have kept) and embraced death for Chriſt. The Prince of <hi>Condee</hi> at the maſſacre of <hi>Paris,</hi> when the King expreſly ſhewed him he ſhould within 3 days die, if he did not renounce his Religion, told him, his eſtate and life were in his hand, but ere he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the truth he would quit both. <hi>Charles de Zer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Likewiſe <hi>Annas du Burgh,</hi> whom we before mentioned, being through fear and diſcouragement drawn to recant, had no reſt in his ſpirit until he retracted the ſame, and after did chearfully undergo death.

               <p>FOURTH Witneſs is, <hi>theſe great and remarkable judgments of God, which in theſe laſt times have befallen the adverſaries and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This is indeed a grave ſubject, wherein we ſhould be very ſerious and ſober; for <hi>the judgments of God are a great depth,</hi> nor can we determine from events but in ſo far as they anſwer to the word. It may ſometime <hi>happen to wicked men according to the work of the righteous;</hi> but on the other hand it is a ſure truth, that <hi>God is known by the judgment he executes,</hi> and in every age doth point out ſin to the World by remarkable ſtrokes, ſome great examples of judgment, which as a beacon are ſet forth for men to obſerve. And truly we may ſay, thoſe remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable inſtances of the judgment of God, ſince he begun to found a retreat to his Church from <hi>Babylon,</hi> are far beyond other preceeding ages. I would be ſparing to repeat what of this kind is publiſhed by others, but that in ſpeaking to this truth, I cannot paſs it in a general, whilſt there are ſo many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherein the Lord hath made himſelf known, and theſe ſuch a convincing ſeal and confirmation of the truth.

                  </gap> ſince there are many examples of this kind already upon record, I do the more briefly touch it; and ſhall only add ſome few which are worthy of a remark in our own land (<hi>Scotland</hi>) how viſibly the Lord did purſue by his judgment ſome who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the truth, and turned oppoſers and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors thereof in their promoting <hi>Antichriſtian Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> contrary to their former profeſſion and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall inſtance Mr. <hi>Patrick Adamſon,</hi> a Preacher once of great repute in this land, but one whom am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and private intereſt ſwayed more than the intereſt of Chriſt, who inſinuating himſelf in the King's favour, made it his work to overturn the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed government and diſcipline of the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he got himſelf ſettled Archbiſhop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> and Prelacy by his means advanced, which the Church from her firſt Reformation from Popery had diſclaimed; yea, in this height of his power and grandeur, turned an avowed perſecutor of his brethren: at which time he uſed to boaſt of 3 things that he ſaid could not fail him, his <hi>riches, learning</hi> and the <hi>King's favour.</hi> But a little after, as was then moſt known, he was by the righteous judgment of God brought to this paſs that his <hi>parts</hi> did ſo far wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and dry up, that in ſeeking a bleſſing on his meat he could ſcarce ſpeak a few words of Senſe, though once admired for his eloquence: as for his <hi>riches,</hi> he was forced to get charity from thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters whom he before perſecuted: and for the <hi>King's favour,</hi> he was ſo abhorred by him, that as he himſelf profeſſed when the ſtroke of God brought him to ſome ſenſe of his condition, <hi>he was ſure the King did care more for the worſt of his dogs than for him.</hi> And thus in great miſery he died, caſt off by the World whoſe favour he had only ſought.

Lord's hand purſuing the ſame, was by himſelf ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, before divers eminent and worthy Miniſters of the Church, who did alſo by their ſubſcription atteſt the ſame, and was afterwards printed.</p>
               <p>It is alſo manifeſt, how the Lord in his judgment did purſue that wretched man, his ſucceſſor, Biſhop <hi>Spotſwood,</hi> who in a more ſubtile way did endeavour the overturning the diſcipline and liberties of the Church, for ſetting up of Prelacy, and by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand-dealing got himſelf firſt thruſt into <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> and after to be Archbiſhop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> yea, at laſt was chancellour of <hi>Scotland,</hi> his eldeſt Son a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron in <hi>Fife,</hi> and his ſecond Son Preſident of the Seſſion, his Daughter alſo married to <hi>Roſline</hi> then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Barron.

ſome of theſe wretches) a ſmall ſum indeed to ſell the cauſe of Chriſt, and by him very dear bought. For after his return, he falleth into ſickneſs, and upon his recovery from that was ſeiſed with horror of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſo that he run out of the pulpit whilſt he was going to preach, confeſſing he had <hi>ſold Chriſt</hi> at that Aſſembly for money; that being poor and having a numerous family, he had choſen rather to <hi>make haſte,</hi> than <hi>believe;</hi> and thus laid aſide his miniſtry, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mr. John Murrey,</hi> who then was ſilenced by the Biſhop, that for Chriſt's ſake he would take the charge of that place. After which he fell into a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and became in ſome meaſure mad: and though he did ſomething recover, yet died in great infamy, poor, and drowned in debt, a very convincing example of the judgment of God. This, old <hi>Mr. Row</hi> of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> being then a miniſter in the ſame Preſbytery, ſets down under his hand, which he moſt certainly knew.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add two remarkable inſtances of the Lord's judgment within theſe few years, that ſhould not be paſt without a remark.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> relates to a <hi>conſiderable family</hi> in this country, who made it their work to trouble and perſecute the Miniſter of that Pariſh, an eminently holy and faithful man; yea, upon the account of his faithfulneſs the old <hi>Laird</hi> of that houſe out of malice doth purſue him with a falſe libel before the Synod, uſing all means he could to reproach his name, having it as his deſign, either to get him broken and put out of the Pariſh, or at leaſt to cruſh his ſpirit, and weaken him in the exerciſe of the miniſtry; but doth there meet with a diſappointment, the Lord clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the innocence of his ſervant, and the malice of the other, ſo that even ſuch who other ways wanted not a prejudice at him, were forced to acknowledge this; at which time that Gentleman, whilſt he went to the ſtable where his horſes were, being then
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:005185_0424_1016DE089A56A918"/>
at the Synod upon that account, is in the place ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſickneſs, forced to haſte home and take bed, and there ſeized with horror of conſcience, which made him oft cry, intreating moſt earneſtly for his Miniſter whom he had thus perſecuted, and oft had theſe words, <hi>O to ſee his face,</hi> yea, told his friends that if he would not come to him, they ſhould carry him to his houſe; but his <hi>Lady</hi> out of malice did in a moſt rude and violent way hinder the Miniſter's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to him, and thus that poor Gentleman in great horror and anguiſh dieth. After his death his Lady doth ſtill purſue the quarrel, with no leſs malice, until ſhe alſo falleth ſick, and therewith had much terror upon her conſcience; yea, did no leſs cry out for the Miniſter, who then was providentially abſent, ſo that ſhe was put to cry, and in that denied, which ſhe did hinder to her poor huſband; though at laſt, he came to her before her death, to whom ſhe with much bitterneſs confeſſed her wrong. After this a young man their <hi>chaplain,</hi> who had been engaged by them to appear as a <hi>witneſs</hi> againſt that godly man, was ſo terrified in his conſcience, that he could get no reſt until he went to the next Synod, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that horrid ſin in bearing <hi>falſe witneſs</hi> againſt his Miniſter; but being there kept by ſome from a publick appearance, he went to another part of the country, where, it is certainly reported, he died diſtracted. Now laſt of all the <hi>young Laird,</hi> who did ſucceed in that eſtate, would needs purſue the quarrel, and finding more acceſs, through the change of the time, did ſo endeavour with ſome who were in power, that an order was paſt for baniſhing him out of that Pariſh: and though he was then otherways ſtaged, upon the account of the publick cauſe yet, it was known, the violent purſuit of that Gentleman was the main cauſe of this ſentence, which thoſe who had hand in paſſing it, did themſelves confeſs. For he
<pb n="390" facs="unknown:005185_0425_1016DDC73A058FB8"/>
had ſolemnly ſworn, that if he lived in that place, that man ſhould not be Miniſter there: but lo! a few days after, having returned to his houſe, and boaſting, how he had kept his word, and now got his Miniſter caſt out of the pariſh, he was ſuddenly ſtruck by the Lord with an high fever, which plucked him away in the very ſtrength of his years. This I had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as it is here ſet down, from a grave Chriſtian, the party himſelf being preſent, which he did humbly decline to relate, though he could not but aſſent thereto.</p>
               <p>The Second is one <hi>David Macbryar,</hi> who was a member of the late Parliament, being one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Burrowes, a man moſt notorious in the country where he lived for a lewd and groſs prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but moſt remarkable and known beyond others for his violence and rage againſt the Godly, as he ſhewed by his carriage, both in the Parliament, and afterwards where he could have acceſs, did ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to trouble and perſecute ſuch under that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful name of <hi>Fanaticks;</hi> but within ſome time there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, whilſt we was forced to retire by reaſon of debt, for fear of caption, he was found one day walking alone, by one who was then come out of the North to that country, and had ridden forth, to ſee if he could catch any of that party whom he judged was then lurking, and ſuppoſing upon his rencounter that he was ſurely one of theſe, would needs appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, but he upon his reſiſtance and ſtrugling againſt him was by him run through with a ſword, and immediately killed on the place, upon that very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and perſwaſion, that he was a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> and <hi>Rebel,</hi> as he then termed him. Thus he who had declared himſelf an enemy to the people of God, whom he was wont in reproach to call <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> was himſelf under that very notion and upon that ground cut down by one of his own ſtamp and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:005185_0426_1016DE0A63E112E8"/>
O was not this <hi>the finger of God,</hi> and a convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof of his righteous judgment!</p>
               <p>FIFTH Witneſs, which holds forth the Lord's eminent appearing, and ſomething of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power, in the late raiſing and reformation of the Church from Antichriſtianiſm, is this, <hi>that large meaſure of the Spirit, and outpouring thereof, which did convincingly follow the Goſpel and miniſtry of the word in theſe laſt times;</hi> a truth which, we muſt ſay, hath been manifeſt, and by many ſolemn proofs thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, no leſs than in the firſt planting of the chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>It is undeniable, how great a witneſs to the truth, the <hi>Spirit</hi> and down-pouring thereof is. For this is God's own <hi>ſeal,</hi> which is not put to a lie, or falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Thus he bears witneſs to his <hi>work</hi> in the hearts of his people, and by this alſo the Lord doth ſeal and atteſt the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the Church, and the <hi>commiſſion</hi> of his ſervants who publiſh the ſame; yea, at ſome <hi>ſpecial ſeaſons,</hi> as when the truth hath leaſt countenance or encouragement from without, times of contradiction when men will not receive its teſtimony, and a ſtrong current of oppoſition is to the Goſpel, then hath this in a more full <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

the adverſaries, to their own conſcience, if without ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their eyes they could ſhift the conviction of a convincing appearance of God, in the power and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> even in a more than ordinary way accompanying the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>ordinances;</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which carried kingdoms and cities before it, yea, in a very ſhort time againſt the greateſt violence and oppoſition.

Surely this was the very <hi>power of God,</hi> a convincing <hi>ſeal</hi> to the truth, and miniſtry of his Servants, who were then perſecuted by the Prelates; yea, a thing which (as it was known) had an awful impreſſion, and was a <hi>terror to their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> I remember amongſt other paſſages, what a worthy Chriſtian told me, how ſometimes <hi>in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> the word, ſuch a <hi>power</hi> and <hi>evidence of the Lord's preſence</hi> was with it, that he hath been forced to riſe, and look through the Church, and ſee what the people were doing; thinking, from what he felt on his own ſpirit, it was a wonder how any could go away without ſome <hi>change</hi> upon them. And then it was ſweet and eaſy for Chriſtians to come 30, 40 <hi>miles</hi> to theſe ſolemn Communions, which they had; and there continue, from the time they came, until they returned, without <hi>wearying,</hi> or making uſe of <hi>ſleep,</hi> yea, but little either meat or drink, and as ſome of them profeſſed, did not feel the need thereof;

Some of his words are theſe; I <hi>ſhall ſhine, I ſhall ſee him as he is, and all the fair company with him, and ſhall have my large ſhare; it is no eaſy thing to be a Chriſtian, but as for me I have got the victory, and Chriſt is holding forth his arms to embrace me.

SIXTH Witneſs is <hi>that convincing appearance of an extraordinary and Apoſtolick ſpirit on ſome of theſe inſtruments, whom the Lord raiſed up in theſe laſt times, and thoſe great endowments wherewith they were ſent forth for the ſervice of the Church, and the overthrow of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Antichriſt:</hi> a truth which, we muſt ſay, if not in ſuch meaſure, yet hath been no leſs evident, than in thoſe primitive times, when the Chriſtian Church was planted.</p>
               <p>It is clear, that extraordinary gifts &amp; endowments have been given, forth to the Church under the New Teſtament, for with the firſt dawning of the Goſpel there were both Apoſtles, &amp; Prophets raiſed up. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be alſo denied, that <hi>ſince</hi> the Cannon of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was cloſed, yea, in theſe <hi>late</hi> ages, there have been very <hi>extraordinary men</hi> given to the Church, who had <hi>ſpecial revelations</hi> from the Lord, of his mind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things to come; which though we ſhould not now <hi>look for,</hi> yet wherein did the Lord <hi>remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly condeſcend,</hi> when ſome great piece of ſervice, and neceſſity of the Church did more call for it. And truly theſe were led in no other path than that of the <hi>Word;</hi> though they had a more ſpecial diſcovery and immediate inbreathing of God's mind, as to the <hi>application thereof in particular caſes:</hi> neither did they preſs upon men's conſcience, to credit the ſame, but were moſt cautious, witneſſing much <hi>humble ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety</hi> on that account.</p>
               <p>It is known, what extraordinary inſtruments, how wonderfully called and qualified, <hi>Luther, Zuing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Calvin, Wiſhart,</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> were, whom God ſent in theſe latter days to grapple with Antichriſt, and ſound a retreat to his Church from <hi>Babylon;</hi> likewiſe <hi>Melanthon, Beza, Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Martyr,</hi> with divers in <hi>England,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Latimer, Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Bradford, &amp;c.</hi> who indeed were burning and ſhining lights in their time, mighty in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

fervent in ſpirit, were cloathed with the power and authority of God, before which the World could not ſtand. But beſides theſe famous wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, of whoſe life we have ſomething this day on publick record, I muſt here crave liberty to ſet down a few more, more late inſtances of our own Church in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to confirm this truth; ſuch as are but little known to the World, nor any thing of their lives publiſhed, which I think a great loſs to after-generations; who, we may ſay (and this with a warrant and in ſobriety) were men <hi>truly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,</hi> eminently ſerviceable in the work of the Lord, yea, of a <hi>Prophetick</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick Spirit,</hi> and ſuch who through grace did not even come ſhort of the <hi>firſt three;</hi> I mean not only thoſe before mentioned, but alſo ſome of thoſe great lights, who were in the <hi>firſt age</hi> of the Church after the aſcenſion of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I. I ſhall inſtance Mr. <hi>John Welſh,</hi> whom the Lord called forth to the miniſtery at <hi>Kirckcubright</hi> in <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway,</hi> and afterwards was tranſported to the Church of <hi>Air,</hi> whom Mr. <hi>Rutherford</hi> in one of his books called that heavenly Prophetical and Apoſtolick Man of God, and ſheweth that from the witneſſes of his life, he had this account, that of every 24 hours he gave uſually eight to prayer, if other neceſſary and urgent duties did not hinder; yea, ſpent many days and nights which he ſet apart, in faſting and prayer for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church, and the ſufferings of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches abroad. I can alſo add this, from very ſure information (and truly about any of theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, I ſeriouſly ſtudy to have ſatisfying grounds of the certainty thereof) that it was his uſage even in the coldeſt winter-nights, to riſe for prayer; and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his wife, who was an excellent woman, hath riſen to ſeek after him, where he hath been found lying on the ground weeping and wreſtling with
<pb n="401" facs="unknown:005185_0436_1016DE17C4282DB0"/>
the Lord; yea, ſometimes he would have been much of the night alone in the Church of <hi>Aire</hi> on that account. One time eſpecially his wiſe finding him overcharged with grief, he told her, <hi>he had that to preſs him,</hi> which ſhe had not, <hi>the ſouls of</hi> 3000 <hi>to anſwer for, whileſt he know not how it was with many of them.</hi> And an other time whileſt ſhe found him alone, his ſpirit almoſt overcharged with anguiſh and grief, upon her ſerious enquiry, ſaid, that the times which were to come on <hi>Scotland,</hi> were heavy and ſad, though ſhe ſhould not ſee them, and this for the contempt of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Whileſt he was priſoner in the <hi>Blackneſs,</hi> in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Chriſtian lady, he giveth this account, <hi>What large joy he had, to ſuffer for ſuch a truth, that Jeſus Chriſt was a King, and had a viſible Kingdom in the World, even his Church, which was as free to keep its Courts, and exerciſe diſcipline by vertue of an intrinſick power from Chriſt, as any Kingdom on the earth, for which he was ready to lay down his life, yea, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to be offered up a ſacrifice on ſo glorious a truth.</hi> In the cloſe of that letter, he doth alſo forewarn, that <hi>judgment was coming to</hi> Scotland, <hi>which ſhould be</hi> blood, <hi>firſt by an inteſtine ſword, and then by the ſword of a ſtranger, and that a great ſacrifice ſhould be there, both of great men, and mean.</hi> The fulfilling whereof hath ſince been very ſenſible, and is known by many alive, who had that letter long before the late troubles begun. Whilſt he was thus priſoner, ſeveral remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſages I have had confirmed by divers worthy of credit, ſome of whom ſhewed me they had them from thoſe who were moſt familiar with the perſons themſelves; they are indeed ſtrange, but we muſt alſo conſider he was an extraordinary man.</p>
               <p>The firſt was this, that one night whileſt he did expound the Scripture after his ſupper, in the priſon (as his cuſtom was) whileſt he with much
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:005185_0437_1016DDD768680650"/>
power and authority was preſſing home the truth, one of the company who had ſome charge in the Caſtle, fell a jearing; which <hi>Mr. Welſh</hi> obſerving, and looking earneſtly to him, did preſently cloſe the Bible, and ceaſe, and a little after having a drink in his hand, be ſaith to a friend at the table before all that were preſent, <hi>There is one ſo profane and groſs, as to contemn and mock at the word of the Lord, but ere a little God ſhall ſmite him with a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtroke of his judgment.</hi> Which accordingly fell out, to the aſtoniſhment of the company; for <hi>that man did preſently drop down to the ground, and died.</hi> A <hi>lady</hi> that was then Popiſh, being preſent by reaſon of a friend of her's that was priſoner in the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, was ſo moved therewith that it proved an help to her after-converſion.</p>
               <p>The other paſſage is this, one <hi>John Steward,</hi> an eminent Chriſtian, who lived at <hi>Aire,</hi> having come to viſit Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> in priſon, found him in a more than ordinary way troubled and ſad, and upon his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry thereabout, he ſaith," <hi>John,</hi> ye ſhould not be here, go home to <hi>Aire,</hi> for the <hi>plague</hi> of God is broken out in that place, and cauſe <hi>Hugh Kennedy</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt of that town (who was alſo a very ſingular Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian) to convene the people to the ſtreets, and pray together; and the Lord ſhall hear <hi>Hugh Kennedy,</hi> and remove that ſtroke. This at the firſt did ſomething aſtoniſh the ſaid <hi>John,</hi> and put him to queſtion its truth, having ſo lately come out of that place: but at his return found it ſo, and accordingly in every thing it fell out as the man of God had ſhewed.</p>
               <p>After his baniſhment, to which the King did change the ſentence of death paſt upon him at <hi>Linlith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> he in a very ſhort time acquired the <hi>French tongue,</hi> with ſuch a facility therein, as was thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

To whom in a humble way, as one more dejected, than lifted up, he gave that anſwer, When he conſidered his being before the LORD, &amp; that he was delivering his meſſage, he could not regard, either great or ſmall, but all fleſh did then go out of his mind.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was Miniſter at <hi>St. Jane de Angeli,</hi> a Proteſtant town in <hi>France,</hi> where his Miniſtry was much bleſſed with ſucceſs, the civil wars did break out, where that city was twice beſieged on the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant intereſt; during which time theſe paſſages fell out moſt remarkable: one was, the town being ſore ſtraited, and ready to be taken, the enemies having raiſed a battery, and by a cloſe approach had made a great breach in the wall, Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> hearing thereof (who had much encouraged the people, that their adverſaries ſhould nor then prevail) went himſelf with the Canonier up the walls, and deſired he would charge ſuch a piece of cannon, and ſhoot, for <hi>God ſhould direct that ſhoe and cauſe to proſper:</hi> which accordingly did, to aſtoniſhment of lookers-on, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount that battery, and the Lord ſo ordered things after, that the King did parley on favourable terms with the city, and did only himſelf with his court come in without doing any violence. Another marvellous paſſage was this; the following Sabbath ſome of the godly in that place, fearing Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> his hazard, did ſeriouſly deal with him, that he
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:005185_0439_1016DDD91DBC8C80"/>
would forbear to go forth, and preach, the Court being there; from which he by no intreaty would be hindred, but ſhewed them he would adventure to preach the word to his People, and truſt the Lord with what concerned himſelf, being more grieved at their fear and deſpondence: and that day had a very great auditory, both of friends, and others who came upon the fame of ſuch a man; but in time of ſermon, a great man of the Court with ſome of the King's own guard was ſent to bring him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with before the King, and whilſt he was entring the Church, which had ſome difficulty by reaſon of the multitude, <hi>Mr. Welſh</hi> did turn himſelf toward that entry, and deſired the people to give way to one of the great <hi>Piers</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that was coming in; but after whilſt he was coming near the pulpit, to execute his commiſſion, by putting force on the Servant of Chriſt, for his deſiſting, <hi>he did with great authority ſpeak to him before all the people, and in the name of his Maſter Jeſus Chriſt charged him that he would not diſturb the Worſhip of God;</hi> wherewith that man was ſo affrighted, that he fell a ſhaking, yea was forced to crutch down, and make no further trouble.—A third paſſage no leſs remarkable was upon the cloſe of Sermon, whilſt <hi>Mr. Welſh</hi> with much ſubmiſſion went to the <hi>King,</hi> who was then greatly incenſed, and with a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning countenance aſked, What he was, and how he durſt preach hereſy ſo near his perſon, and with ſuch contumacy carry himſelf? To which, with due reverence bowing himſelf, he did anſwer. <hi>I am, Sir, the Servant and Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe truth I preached this day, which if your Majeſty rightly knew, ye would have judged it your duty to have come your ſelf, and heard: and for my doctrine I did this day preach theſe</hi> 3 <hi>truths to your People.</hi> (1.) <hi>That man is ſullen,</hi> and by nature in a loſt condition,
<pb n="405" facs="unknown:005185_0440_1016DE1EB24A7748"/>
yea, by his own power and abilities is not able to help himſelf from that eſtate. (2.) <hi>That there is no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> or deliverance from wrath <hi>by our own merits,</hi> by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his merit alone. (3.) I did alſo preach this day the <hi>juſt liberties of the Kingdom of France,</hi> that <hi>your Majeſty oweth obedience to Chriſt</hi> only, who is <hi>Head</hi> of the Church; and that the <hi>Pope,</hi> as he is an <hi>enemy to Chriſt,</hi> and his truth, ſo alſo to the Kings of the earth, whom he keepeth under ſlavery to his uſurped power. Whereat the <hi>King</hi> for a time keeping ſilence, with great aſtoniſhment, turned to ſome about him, and ſaid, <hi>Surely this is a man of God!</hi> Yea, after did commune with him, and with great reſpect diſmiſſed him. The year following, whilſt the differences betwixt the King and Proteſtant party did grow, that city was again beſieged, taken, and in part ſacked as Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> did publickly foretell: at which time, it is known, how the <hi>King</hi> paſt a ſolemn <hi>order,</hi> that none ſhould in the leaſt wrong Mr. <hi>Welſh,</hi> or any thing that belonged to him, under high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pains, and did after give a <hi>ſafe conduct</hi> to him, for tranſporting himſelf to <hi>England,</hi> where he died; King <hi>James</hi> refuſing his return to his own country, though earneſtly petitioned by his wife, for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's health.</p>
               <p>During his ſickneſs, he was ſo filled and overcome with the ſenſible enjoyment of God, that he was ſometime overheard in prayer, to have theſe words, <hi>Lord, hold thy hand, it is enough! thy ſervant is a clay veſſel, and can hold no more!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. I ſhall alſo here inſtance Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce,</hi> who in a very extraordinary way was called to the Miniſtry, having for a long time followed the ſtudy of the <hi>Law,</hi> both in this country and in <hi>France,</hi> yea, had ſome ground to expect a place amongſt the Lord's of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="406" facs="unknown:005185_0441_1016DDDDE8DF1E98"/>
who had many friends: but a more preſſing and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible call from God did otherwiſe determine.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was in the Miniſtry at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he ſhined as a great light through the whole land: the power and efficacy of the SPIRIT moſt ſenſibly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the word he preached, he was a terrour to evil doers: and the authority of God did ſo appear up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and his carriage, with ſuch a Majeſty in his countenance, as forced fear and reſpect from the greateſt in the land, even thoſe who were moſt avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed haters of Godlineſs; yea, it was known, what an awful impreſſion King <hi>James</hi> had of him, and did once give him that teſtimony before many, that he judged Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> was worthy of the <hi>half of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a man that had much <hi>inward exerciſe</hi> about his own perſonal caſe; had been oft aſſaulted about that great foundation of truth, if there was a God; which coſt him many days and nights wreſtling, and when he hath come up to the pulpit, after being ſometimes ſilent, which was his uſual way, he would ſay, <hi>I think it is a great matter to believe there is a God;</hi> telling the People, it was an other thing to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that,</hi> than they judged. But it was alſo known, by his friends with whom he was familiar, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>confirmations</hi> he had from the Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, what near familiarity he did attain in his ſecret converſe with God: yea, truly ſome things, I have had from perſons worthy of credit thereabout, would ſeem ſo ſtrange and marvellous, that I forbear to ſet them down.</p>
               <p>The great ſucceſs of his Miniſtry at <hi>Edinburgh, Inverneſs,</hi> and other places whither providence cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, is abundantly known. Whilſt he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined at <hi>Inverneſs,</hi> that poor dark country was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly enlightned, many brought in to Chriſt by his Miniſtry, and a ſeed ſown in theſe places, which
<pb n="407" facs="unknown:005185_0442_1016DE214D1C4ED8"/>
even to this day is not wholly worn out. I ſhall here ſet down one paſſage of famous Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> who at his firſt entry to the Miniſtry at <hi>Leuchars,</hi> was very prelatick, and by the Biſhop of <hi>St. Andrews</hi> brought in againſt the pariſh's conſent, ſo that on the day of his admiſſion, the Church doors being ſhut by the People, they were forced to break in by a window to get him entrance. But a little after this, upon the report of a Communion, where Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> was to help, he would needs from a longing he had to hear and ſee ſuch a man, go <hi>ſecretly</hi> there; and placed himſelf in a <hi>dark</hi> part of the Church, where he might not be known: when Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> was come to the pulpit, he did for a conſiderable time keep ſilence, as his maner was, which did ſome way aſtoniſh Mr. <hi>Henderſon,</hi> but much more when he heard the firſt words wherewith he begun, which were theſe, <hi>He that cometh not in by the door, but climbeth up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, the ſame is a thief and a robber.</hi> Which did by the Lord's bleſſing at the very preſent take him by the heart, and had ſo great an impreſſion on him, that it was the firſt means of his converſion.</p>
               <p>He was one that had <hi>the ſpirit of diſcerning</hi> in a great meaſure, did <hi>prophetically</hi> ſpeak of many things which afterwards came to paſs; yea, which I had atteſted by ſober and grave Chriſtians, who were familiar with him, that divers perſons diſtracted, and of thoſe who were paſſed all hope of recovery in the falling ſickneſs, were brought to Mr. <hi>Bruce,</hi> and after prayer by him in their behalf were fully recovered. This indeed may ſeem ſtrange, but it is alſo true; Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> was a great wreſtler, who had more than ordinary familiarity with his Maſter.</p>
               <p>A little before his death, when he was at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and through weakneſs kept his chamber, there was a meeting of divers godly Miniſters at that time there, on ſome ſpecial ground of the Church's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
<pb n="408" facs="unknown:005185_0443_1016DDE0903AD4B8"/>
who hearing he was in the town came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and gave him an account of the actings of thoſe times, the Prelates then deſigning the ſervice book: after which Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> prayed, and did therein tell over again to the Lord the very ſubſtance of their diſcourſe, which was a ſad repreſentation of the caſe of the Church, at which time there was ſuch an <hi>extraordinary</hi> MOTION <hi>on all preſent, ſo ſenſible a downpouring of the</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>that they could hardly contain themſelves;</hi> yea, which was moſt ſtrange, even ſome <hi>unuſual motion</hi> on theſe who were in <hi>other parts of the houſe,</hi> not knowing the cauſe at that very inſtant. One Mr. <hi>Weemes</hi> of <hi>Lothaker</hi> being then occaſionally preſent, when he went away, ſaid, <hi>O how ſtrange a man is this! for he knocked down the Spirit of God on us all.</hi> This he ſaid becauſe Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> did divers times <hi>knock with his fingers on the table.</hi> I had this from a worthy Chriſtian Gentleman, in whoſe mother's houſe this was.</p>
               <p>He was deeply affected with the naughtineſs and prophanity of many <hi>Miniſters</hi> then in the Church, and the unſuitable carriage of others to ſo great a calling; and did expreſs much his fear, that the miniſtry of <hi>Scotland</hi> would prove the greateſt perſecutors of the Goſpel that it had. If there were a full collection of thoſe remarkable paſſages, which have been known to others in his life, it would further witneſs what an extraordinary man that was.

III. Mr. <hi>Davidſon,</hi> Miniſter of the Goſpel at <hi>Salt-Preſtoun,</hi> may be truly here inſtanced as one of an <hi>extraordinary, prophetick Spirit,</hi> who was likewiſe eminently zealous and faithful for his Maſter in a time of the Church's defection; as <hi>Didoclavius</hi> in that forementioned preface terms him, <hi>Cato et conſtans Cato ſui temporis.</hi> He did then foreſee Prelacies breaking in upon the Church, when King <hi>James</hi> were preſſing the ſetting up of <hi>Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents</hi> under a very ſpecious pretext, and was for that end himſelf preſent at the Aſſembly in <hi>Dundee,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged many, alaſs too many! to conſent thereto, but Mr. <hi>Davidſon</hi> with great boldneſs roſe up, and warned the aſſembly of the hazard, and told them he ſaw the <hi>knave Biſhop,</hi> with his mitre, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in under that maſk, yea, did ſolemnly in his own name, and name of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a proteſtation againſt that ſtep of defection, and their yielding up in ſo far the liberties of the Church, to pleaſe men.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was Miniſter at <hi>Salt-Preſtoun,</hi> the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church was by him much endeavoured, which he did advance much out of his own private intereſt; my Lord <hi>Newbatle</hi> who then had a great intereſt in the Pariſh engaging to help it forward: from which he after reſiled, and thereby fruſtrated the work. Whereupon Mr. <hi>Davidſon</hi> told him, theſe walls that were then begun to be builded, ſhould ſtand as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt him, and that ere long God ſhould root out him and his eſtate out of that Pariſh, and he ſhould not have a piece of land in the ſame! which ſhortly after had a viſible accompliſhment. It was very clear from many paſſages of his life, that <hi>the ſecret of the Lord</hi> was in an extraordinary way with him. Some of thoſe which have been tranſmitted from them who particularly knew the ſame are indeed moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a remark.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="unknown:005185_0445_1016DDE368AFA640"/>
At a certain aſſembly of the Church, Mr. <hi>John Spotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> &amp; Mr. <hi>James Law,</hi> who were then entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miniſtry, were proceſſed for ſome groſs acts of prophanity: where Mr. <hi>Davidſon</hi> finding the aſſembly too eaſy to paſs the ſame, in regard of their parts and gifts, only with a rebuke, he did with much vehemency preſs their depoſition; and after being croſſed therein, ſaid, <hi>You will needs ſpare theſe two men, whereat I am grieved, but the time is coming when they ſhall trample upon your necks and upon the Church of</hi> Scotland. And it is well known what an accompliſhment this prediction had.</p>
               <p>Being with Mr. <hi>Bruce</hi> one time at dinner, who was then in great favour with the King, he had theſe words in giving thanks after meat. <hi>Lord, thy ſervant here is now a great favourite of the Court, and in much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect: but he ſhall be within a little as much perſecuted as he is now in favour, and go down the ſtreets, when many who have him this day in eſteem will not give him a ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Which was very manifeſt afterwards. And at another time, whilſt Mr. <hi>Robert Bruce</hi> and he were dining together in the houſe of one of the Magiſtrates of the town, who was then a cordial friend to godly Miniſters, he did alſo in his plain and free way break forth with theſe words, whilſt he was giving thanks, <hi>Lord, this good man hath reſpect for thy ſake to thy ſervants, but he little knoweth that in a ſhort time he muſt carry us both, who are here to priſon.</hi> Which words did much trouble that honeſt man, tho' afterwards it came moſt exactly to paſs.</p>
               <p>There is one more remarkable paſſage, which I ſhould fear to ſet down, it is ſo ſtrange, but that I had the ſame confirmed by ſome worthy of credit, who ſhewed me, that from thoſe that were preſent, and familiar with Mr. <hi>Davidſon,</hi> they had it related. A <hi>Gentleman</hi> nearly related to a great family of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="411" facs="unknown:005185_0446_1016DE26D4A752B0"/>
but a moſt violent hater of piety, did upon that account beat a poor honeſt man who lived there, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not the leaſt ſhadow of a provocation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other ſore ſtrokes gave one upon the back with theſe words, <hi>Take this for Mr.</hi> Davidſon's <hi>ſake.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the honeſt man was for a time forced to keep his bed, and complained moſt of that ſtroke, which he gave him on the back, as that which he felt more than all the reſt; but the Sabbath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mr. <hi>Davidſon</hi> ſpeaking in the cloſe of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon about the oppreſſion of the godly, and enmity which wicked men had to ſuch, did very particularly touch that late inſtance, ſaying, <hi>It was a ſad time, a prophane man would thus openly adventure to vent his rage againſt thoſe who were ſeekers of God in the place, whilſt be could have no cauſe but the very appearance of his image;</hi> and with great authority ſaid, <hi>He who hath done this, were he the Laird, or the Laird's brother, ere a few days paſs, God ſhall give him a ſtroke, that all the Monarchs of the earth dare not challenge.</hi> Which was then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known how in the cloſe of that week, ſtanding before his door, he was <hi>ſtruck dead with a thunder-bolt,</hi> and all his bones cruſht.</p>
               <p>A little before the death of this great Servant of Chriſt, having an occaſional recounter with Mr. <hi>John Ker,</hi> a young Gentleman who was lately come from <hi>France,</hi> and had then no thoughts of the miniſtry, but was in a very courtly dreſs, Mr. <hi>Davidſon</hi> did in a ſolemn way charge him to caſt off his ſcarlet cloak, and lay aſide his guilded rapper, and take him to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

IV. Mr. <hi>Patrick Simpſon,</hi> who was once Miniſter of <hi>Cramond,</hi> and after tranſported to <hi>Stirling,</hi> may be here alſo inſtanced, as a very extraordinary man in the Church. In his youth he attained to great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the languages, did much ſtudy Greek and Latin Authors; and gave this reaſon to ſuch who wondred he ſhould ſpend ſo much time in reading thoſe who were but pagans, That he purpoſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate all theſe jewels which he borrowed from the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> to the building of the houſe of the Lord. It is known, with what zeal he did oppoſe himſelf to the corruptions of that time. In the year 1584, whilſt there was an expreſs charge from the King, for acknowledging Mr. <hi>Patrick Adamſon</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>St. Andrews,</hi> or elſe loſe their maintenance, he did with great vehemency appear againſt the ſame, tho' that man was his uncle upon the mother's ſide; and ſome who ſeemed willing to ſubſcribe thereto with ſuch a condition, <hi>according to the Word of God,</hi> he did gravely rebuke, ſhewing them it could be no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo to their conſcience, ſince it was <hi>repugnantia in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecto,</hi> to ſubſcribe to any humane inſtitution accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the word, when the word did expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the ſame.

One very remarkable paſſage of his life I do here adventure to ſet down, having very ſatisfying grounds as to the certainty of it, from thoſe who knew the ſame, and had a particular relation of all its circumſtances from a grave Chriſtian, who had it out of his own mouth, and likewiſe hath it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten under old Mr. <hi>Row</hi> of <hi>Carnock's</hi> hand, who was his familiar intimate friend; it is this.

               <p>Now, beſides theſe great men, many others who at that time did ſhine as lights in the Church, may be here alſo mentioned; who were indeed ſtars of the firſt magnitude, eminently zealous and faithful, and their Miniſtry followed with much of the power and authority of God.

Whereat the ſaid <hi>John</hi> being excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly aſtoniſhed, he ſaith to him; <hi>It is no time to linger, let us go pray, for my ſon with the reſt of our friends now at ſea are at this hour on the very nick of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing.</hi> And after they had ſpent ſome time in prayer, he aroſe chearfully and ſaid, <hi>Now they are ſafe!</hi> Within a little after, <hi>John Steward</hi> who had writ this down, with the day and hour, at the return of the Ships did moſt particularly enquire, and found how it did anſwer in all the circumſtances, and in that very hour of that night they were to appearance paſt hope of ſafety upon a very dangerous place, and by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary unxpected providence then delivered.</p>

               <p>He was famous in his generation for <hi>the power he had in prevailing with God</hi> by prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereof take theſe following inſtances amongſt the many which might be given.</p>
               <p>One is, that being on a certain night under an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary preſſure of ſpirit to go and pour forth his heart to God, he left his wiſe in bed, and going out to a garden, ſpent moſt of the night in that exerciſe (a thing ſo ordinary to him that he uſed to ſay, he wondered how a Chriſtian could lie a bed all night, without riſing to ſpend ſome of the night in prayer and praiſe!) but his wife weary, at laſt went to ſeek for him, but miſſing him in his ordinary place, went into other gardens, by ſuch paſſages as ſhe knew, at laſt ſhe heard a voice, and drawing near to it, could hear him ſpeak a few words, but with great force and fervency, mixed and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with floods of tears; which were theſe, <hi>O God, wilt thou not give me</hi> Scotland! <hi>O God, wilt thou not give me</hi> Scotland!—She being weary, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to interrupt him, went home, and heard not the cloſe. At laſt he came home, and re-entring his bed, his wife began to reprove his unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his own body; then aſked him, what it was he was ſaying? for ſhe told, ſhe heard him. Well, ſaid he, you had better have been in your bed, but ſince ye heard, I tell you, I have indured a great fight for <hi>Scotland</hi> this night, and hardly could I get a remnant reſerved, yet <hi>he will be gracious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="unknown:005185_0459_1016DE38ECED1940"/>
After this he aroſe another night, but went not out of doors, but in a chamber he travelled and groaned ſo, as that his wife impatient did riſe ſeveral times, calling him to bed; but he waited his time: and when he came, ſhe began a modeſt expoſtulation with him for tarrying. <hi>Hold thy peace,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>it will be well with us; but I ſhall never preach another preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in</hi> Aire.—And having fallen aſleep, before he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, the meſſenger was come, who by command carried him priſoner to the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he was priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the Lord <hi>Uchiltry</hi> was Captain, whoſe ſiſter was Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> his mother in law, being <hi>John Knox's</hi> wife; Yet being much taken up in King <hi>James</hi> his Court, he took not time to be ſo comfortable to his couſin <hi>Welſh</hi> as he ſhould: But being convinced of his own unkindneſs, he cauſed Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> to ſup with him one night in the Caſtle, where were alſo ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentlemen, and amongſt them a <hi>Popiſh youth</hi> ſat toward the lower end of the table; Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> being by the Captain ſet at the upper end, entertained the company with grave and edifying diſcourſe, which all delighted to hear, ſave this young Papiſt, who with laughter and deriſion laboured to ſilence him, which was little regarded by Mr. <hi>Welſh.</hi> But after ſupper, while the gueſts ſat a little, this youth ſtood up at the lower end of the table, and while Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> proceeded from grave to gracious entertainment of his company, the youth came to that height of inſolence as with the finger to point at him &amp; with the face to make flouting grimaces, whereby he grieved the holy Man, ſo as on a ſudden he was forced to a ſilence.—</p>
               <p>The whole company, who had heard him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, were ſilent with him. Within a little, Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> as moved by the Spirit of God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And while every man feared himſelf, except the inſolent youth, <hi>he</hi> fell down dead ſuddenly at the foot of the table, to ſhew the power of God's jealouſy againſt the mockers of his Spirit and of the offers of his grace.

               <p>One day while Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> looked out at his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-window in the Caſtle, he happened to ſee the Captain, and called unto him, ſaying, God ſave you, my lord! The Captain acknowledging his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, and aſking for Mr. <hi>Welſh</hi> his welfare, deſired to know how he might ſerve him. <hi>In nothing,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Welſh, if you be well, except you would carry my petition to his Majeſty, intreating for liberty to preach the Goſpel.</hi> I willingly will, ſaid the Captain, therefore ſend it to me. Nay, ſaid Mr. <hi>Welſh,</hi> I am your Kinſman, I love you ſo well as to warn you not to take it in charge, except you reſolve to deal truly in delivering it and in getting me an anſwer. I ſhall bear the blame, ſaid the Captain, if I do it not. I beſeech you, my lord, ſaid the other, undertake not unleſs you mind to do it, for the hazard is great. Well, <hi>Uchiltry</hi> takes it: but not coming in an opportune ſeaſon (for he came when the King was paſſionately moved on another occaſion) he thought not fit then to give it; &amp; as at that time he deferred, ſo thereafter he neglected, and at laſt quite forgot to deliver it at all.

Nay, my lord, ſaid Mr. <hi>Welſh,</hi> you ſhould not <hi>lie to God,</hi> and to me: I know you delivered it not, I am ſorry (my lord) for your lot, I warned you not to be falſe to God; and now I tell you, God ſhall take your eſtate and honours in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſhall <hi>give them to your neighbour,</hi> and this in your own time.—This troubled the lord <hi>Uchiltry,</hi> and came truly to paſs: for he being the eldeſt ſon of the good Lord <hi>Uchiltry,</hi> a reformer, was forced in his own time to quit all, and give both eſtate and honours to <hi>James,</hi> the ſon of Captain <hi>James,</hi> the ſecond brother, who was the laſt of that houſe.</p>
               <p>III. Concerning Maſter <hi>John Scrimger,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Kinghorn.</hi> There was a godly Woman under his charge, called—who fell ſick of a very lingring ſickneſs, and was all the while aſſaulted with ſtrong temptations, apprehending ſhe was a caſt-away (yet had ſhe not only given ground for charity, but her Chriſtian converſation for a long time had put the reality of the grace of God in her beyond debate with the more diſcerning who knew her) Mr. <hi>Scrimger</hi> often viſited her, while in this deep exerciſe, conferred with her, prayed over her; but her trouble remained notwithſtanding, and the terrors of God ſtill lodged with her. When ſhe drew near her diſſolution, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came worſe both in body and ſpirit; and ſent for Mr. <hi>Scrimger,</hi> who at that time took two of his elders with him, and in their preſence firſt endeavoured to comfort her by exhortation and conference, then he pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

this! our laying before her grounds of comfort will not do it, conference will not do it, prayer will not do it, we muſt uſe another remedy. Sure I am, this is <hi>a Daughter of Abraham;</hi> ſure I am, I am the <hi>Elder;</hi> ſure I am, ſhe hath <hi>ſent for me.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>in name of God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who ſent him to redeem ſinners: <hi>in name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who obeyed the Father, and came to ſave us: <hi>in name of the holy and bleſſed Spirit,</hi> our Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>An Example it is of God's power in that time, to make our hair ſtand, at the force of faith and boldneſs of Spirit; rather than to be imitated by ſuch as want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient holineſs would rather have a Spirit for miracles, than for ſalvation.</p>
               <p>IV. I ſhall here inſert ſome ſpecial and edifying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of the life of that great and worthy ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Robert Blair</hi> (well known to this Church, it being but a few years ſince his death) who was deſervedly numbred among the firſt of thoſe great and worthy inſtruments, whom the Lord raiſed up amongſt us for carrying on the late bleſſed refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. Some of which I knew from himſelf (tho' from much humble modeſty he too much in theſe things concealed himſelf, and ſhunned the ſetting down thereof under his own hand, whereto he was much preſſed) but the moſt of them I had from one of his ſpecial intimate friends, and a grave and eminent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of this Church.</p>
               <p>In his younger years, it was known, how much he outrun others in his ſtudies, and gave thoſe who knew him ground to hope, what after was ſeen; the Lord was pleaſed to call him by the Miniſtry of famous

                  <hi>Trochrig,</hi> in whoſe hand (theſe were his own words) did the Lord put the key that firſt opened his heart. Upon his firſt coming forth to preach, he by a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable providence had Maſter <hi>Bruce,</hi> whom you have formerly mentioned, to be his hearer; and as I heard himſelf declare, it was his deſire to have the judgment of ſo great a man upon his diſcourſe; whoſe cenſure, he ſaid, he would never forget, it had been ſo much bleſſed. Which was this, <hi>I found</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your Sermon very poliſhed and digeſted</hi> (which was indeed eaſie to one of his parts) <hi>but there is one thing I did miſs in it, to wit, the</hi> Spirit <hi>of God; I found not that.</hi> This grave Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> did often ſpeak to others, which then took a deep impreſſion upon himſelf, &amp; helped him to ſee it was ſomething elſe to be a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt than to be a knowing &amp; eloquent preacher. He was for divers years <hi>Regent</hi> in the colledge o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Glaſgow;</hi> where he made it his work, to train up thoſe under his charge in the ſtudy of <hi>godlineſs,</hi> as well as of humane learning: but by reaſon of the prejudice of ſome who had power in that place, he could not long ſtay. One paſſage whilſt he was there, I did hear him relate: upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſome ſinful oath to be preſſed upon the Maſters of the college, he inquired at a fellow-Regent of his, Mr. <hi>Gawin Forſyth,</hi> what he would do in that matter? whoſe anſwer was, <hi>By my faith, I muſt live.</hi> To whom Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sir, I will not ſwear by my faith, as you do; but truly I intend to live by my faith. You may chooſe your own way; but I will adventure on the Lord.</hi> That wretched man did continue, to whom the matter of an oath was a ſmall thing, after he was gone: but which is worthy of a remark, many years after, Mr. <hi>Forſyth</hi> fell into ſuch poverty, as forced his ſupplicating of the general aſſembly of the Church for ſome relief, where worthy Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> was then made choiſe of to preſide as Moderator, &amp; upon his appearance in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable caſe could not ſhun the obſerving o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When he came to the place, he found, the <hi>Dean</hi> was indeed lying ſick, and though a moſt naughty man, made him not only welcome upon his viſit, but incouraged him to hold on in his way, and told him he was to ſucceed him in that change; yea, he ſpoke ſo unlike himſelf, and in a ſtrain ſo different from what was uſual unto him, that a Gentlewoman ſtanding by ſaid to ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others, an <hi>Angel</hi> is ſpeaking out of the Dean's bed to Mr. <hi>Blair;</hi> thinking, it could not be ſuch a man.</p>

Maſter <hi>Blair</hi> bleſſing the Lord, exhorted him to choſe him for his refuge. He was after threatned and much terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Devil, but nothing more followed.</p>

up publickly in the congregation, and with great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority did cite the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to appear before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Jeſus Chriſt, to anſwer for what he was doing, contrary to his own light and conſcience, againſt thoſe whom he knew to be faithful Miniſters of the goſpel: whereupon the man was ſo aſtoniſhed, that he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cried out, I appeal from the tribunal of the juſtice of God to the throne of his mercy! To whom Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> replies; Sir, your appeal is rejected: for you know, what you are doing is directly againſt your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which hath made you bear witneſs to us as the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt. A few months after, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> fell ſick; and the phyſicians inquiring about his caſe, he only could ſay, <hi>My conſcience!</hi> and ſo died.</p>
               <p>Whilſt under reſtraint, he was by his brethren ſent to <hi>England,</hi> to deal with the <hi>King</hi> for their liberty. When he was on the road, he was taken with a mighty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And in this poſture he turned to the Lord in prayer; but immediately after, eſſaying if he could poſſibly lift up his back, he found to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

A few days after, in the ſame journey, his horſe fell very lame; which did in ſome meaſure trouble him, having no convenient acceſs to provide himſelf of an other: and even upon this, did addreſs to the Lord by prayer, that in ſuch a ſtrait he might be helped, which he graciouſly condeſcended to do, ſo that the horſe was to his amazement healed, and without the leaſt halt did carry him to <hi>London.</hi>

yet he reſolved to continue, and roll the buſineſs over on the Lord, for whoſe ſervice he was only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuning an open door. And one day having gone to <hi>Greenwitch,</hi> where the court then was, being wearied with waiting without acceſs, he retired into the park to pray, where after much wreſtling with the Lord, he was in a more than ordinary way brought near, and had ſo clear a return, that he could not withſtand the aſſurance he got, that his way ſhould be ſucceſsful: but the appearance thereof in an ordinary way being ſo ſmall, preſſed him to adventure humbly the aſking of a <hi>ſign</hi> from the Lord; and immediately, after there being a conſiderable <hi>wind</hi> that blew hard and made a noiſe among the bulruſhes that grew there, ſo great a <hi>calm</hi> did preſently follow, that not the leaſt plant of the ground did any ways move or ſtir.

V. This ſeems an eminent inſtance of the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and worthy to be on record, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Laird of <hi>Raith,</hi> of a known and ancient family in this country, who in the beginning of the reformation was a profeſſed <hi>Papiſt;</hi> but the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting that great ſervant of his, Mr. <hi>Wiſhart,</hi> one night very late to his houſe, who after ſome repulſe from a ſervant got acceſs to this Gentleman, and told him, He was come with the offer of the Goſpel of Chriſt to him, and his family, if he would receive it; which was in that manner backed with the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, and his power on that Gentleman's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that he moſt kindly received Mr. <hi>Wiſhart,</hi> and told him, His offer was welcome. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this viſit was made ſo ſucceſsful, upon Mr. <hi>Wiſhart</hi>'s inſtructing him and his family in the truth that they publickly profeſſed the ſame; and this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman evidenced his being truly taken by the heart. But ſometime after, upon a ſnare laid for him by Cardinal <hi>Beaton,</hi> he was ſeiſed upon in the Laird of <hi>Grange</hi> his houſe, and thence carried priſoner to the caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and ſo hotly purſued by this wretched man's rage, who then was in his greateſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that in a ſhort time he was ſentenced to die; his <hi>Lady</hi>'s being overwhelmed with grief, upon her huſband's ſuffering and the forfeiture of that eſtate, having five ſons, beſides ſome daughters, to provide, did move him.

<pb n="435" facs="unknown:005185_0470_1016DE8D128B48B0"/>
much delight: at dinner <hi>Faber</hi> became exceedingly ſad, and now and then fell out in bitter weeping; at which the Queen complained, and inquiring the cauſe, why he weeped whilſt ſhe had come to be merry with him, he in the end ſaid, Moſt ſerene Queen, how can I be glad, or make others glad, who am as wicked a man as the earth bears<hi>!</hi> And what is that wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſays ſhe, you have committed, who are known from your youth to have lived ſo holy? He anſwered, I am now the age of an hundred years, free from the touch of any woman, and remember not that I have committed what would burthen my conſcience, or make me afraid to leave the world; except one ſin, for which I am aſſured propitiation is poſſible. And as ſhe preſſed him to tell it, whilſt he could ſcarce ſpeak for abundance of tears, He ſaid, How can I ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne of God? who having taught others in purity and ſincerity the holy Evangel of the Son of God, many of whom having followed my doctrine, have conſtantly ſuffered a thouſand tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp; death it ſelf, &amp; in the mean time I, an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Doctor, did flee; and though I had lived long enough, and ſhould not have feared death, but rather deſired it, did yet withdraw, and thus cowardly tranſgreſſed the command of my God! Whereupon the Queen, as ſhe was moſt eloquent, did by reaſon and example ſhew him, this had befallen others of the holy ſervants of God: and others there alſo, did add ſuch conſiderations, as that he became more chearful, &amp; ſaid, there remains nothing, but that I go from hence to God, and after I have now made my Teſtament, I have that <hi>impreſſion,</hi> I muſt delay no longer, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Lord calls for me.</hi> After, he fixed his eyes on the Queen, and ſays, Madam, I make you my heir: and to your preacher, <hi>Gerard,</hi> I leave my Books: and my cloaths, and other things I have, I leave to the poor. Whereupon the Queen ſmiling, aſked, What

then <hi>Mr. Faber</hi> ſhall I have? The care, ſaid he, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, to diſtribute this to the poor. It is well, ſaid ſhe; I ſolemnly profeſs, this Legacy is more acceptable to me, than if the King, my Brother, had named me his heir. Thereafter they ſaw him more joyful; then he ſaid, I have need of ſome reſt, be you merry and joyful, and in the mean time <hi>adieu;</hi> and having ſpoke this, he turned him over on a bed that was near; where, as they judged, he lay ſleeping, but was indeed <hi>fallen a ſleep in the Lord,</hi> without the leaſt ſign of a previous indiſpoſition: for when they were about to awake him they found him to their admiration <hi>dead.</hi> Such was the end of this perſonage undoubitably holy, which the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> did her ſelf relate to the Elector <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Palatine,</hi> when he was ſick at <hi>Paris,</hi> in his return from <hi>Spain,</hi> from the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and it was communicated by a worthy Gentleman <hi>Hubertus Thomas,</hi> a counſeller <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="438" facs="unknown:005185_0473_1016DE4C9DABDB10"/>
ſaid, I have been taking my leave of the Church of <hi>Dunagor;</hi> and I was there taking timber &amp; ſtones to witneſs, that in my ſhort time I had laboured to be faithful, and that according to my light I have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the whole counſel of God</hi> to the People. (How great a teſtimony of the conſcience was this!) After fourteen nights lying, Mr. <hi>Ridge</hi> a choice En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Miniſter there came to viſit him, and ſaid, I hope, Sir, you do not now rue that ye have been faithful. He anſwered, I rue nothing, but that I was too long in beginning (he mean'd his reſiſting, for ſeveral years, a call to the miniſtry, to which he had been much preſſed) and I will tell you a ſtrange thing, which hath helped me to be faithful. Theſe laſt ſeven years there hath not one <hi>day</hi> paſſed me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoughts of <hi>death,</hi> and renewed <hi>ſubmiſſion</hi> to it; yea, this made me neglect my body, which ſhould have ſerved the Lord, as if it hath been mire in the ſtreet; which now troubleth me.—That night when he died, ſeveral godly and grave Chriſtians were with him; where for a long time he fell in a deep ſilence; which ended with heavy groanings often reiterated: at laſt a Chriſtian there deſired to know, what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him? but he refuſed to tell. At laſt being urged he ſaid, I ſhall tell you, My hair ſtands, to behold what I ſee coming on theſe Lands (this was in the Year. 1634.) and being further preſſed, he ſaid, <hi>the bloody</hi> wars of <hi>Germany</hi> ſhall never be ballanced with the wars of theſe three Kingdoms. What do you ſpeak, Sir! ſaid one of the company. To whom he anſwered, <hi>The dead bodies of many thouſands, who this day deſpiſe the glorious Goſpel, ſhall lie upon the earth as dung unburied.</hi> And whilſt aſked, what then ſhall be come of us and our poſterity? He lifted up his voice, and ſaid, <hi>He that is for the ſword, to the ſword; he that is for captivity, to captivity; &amp; he that is for famine, to famine:
<pb n="439" facs="unknown:005185_0474_1016DE92A49E1988"/>
and God ſhall be avenged on theſe Lands.</hi> And whilſt one ſaid, Is there no remedy?

This paſſage alſo I muſt inſtance, of a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble providence to a grave &amp; to this day famous Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in our country, <hi>John Steward,</hi> provoſt of <hi>Air;</hi> who from his very young years did witneſs a reſpect to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. He had a conſiderable eſtate left him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but having ſo great a weight and impreſſion on his ſpirit, of the diſtreſs and ſtraitned condition of many good people whom he knew in the country, and love to Jeſus Chriſt and his truth having got the command over him and all his intereſts, he did deliberatly call them (as he had acceſs) together in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and having ſpent ſome time in prayer, took their ſolemn promiſe, not to reveal while he lived, what he was going to do: he ſaid, he knew in what ſtraits many of them were, to hold up the credit of the profeſſion, and therefore he had brought a little money to lend each of them; yet ſo as they ſhould never offer to repay it, till he required the ſame. This was not known until his death, that ſome of theſe found themſelves obliged to make it known. Some time after he had beſtowed this money, the plague having been ſore in <hi>Air,</hi> and trade much decayed, he himſelf fell under ſome ſtraits, and ſome of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane in that place begun to make it their b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

When he came to <hi>Rechel,</hi> the ſalt and other commodities were become exceeding cheep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there had been no trading of a long time, on which he adventured to fraight a ſhip, and load her upon credit: he himſelf came over the neareſt <hi>to England,</hi> and thence to <hi>Air,</hi> with expectation of the ſhip's return.

At laſt a maid, who had heard amongſt the people, that <hi>John Steward'</hi>s ſhip was arrived in the road, came running, &amp; cried at the door, that <hi>his ſhip was come:</hi> but he being at prayer, could not be moved from his Maſter's company, till he was ſatisfied, and then went forth and ſaw it was a truth. But as a further ground of preſent exerciſe to him, a worthy Chriſtian and great intimate of his, <hi>John Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedy,</hi> who for joy had gone forth in a ſmall boat to the ſhip, was by the ſudden falling down of a ſtorm carried <hi>by</hi> the ſhip, and in the judgment of all that looked on, he and the boat were ſwallowed up; yea, the ſtorm increaſed at that rate, that they feared the loſs of the ſhip alſo: which did ſo deeply affect this gracious man, that for three days he could be ſeen by none, under the weight of a ſuch trial. But at laſt, having gone forth to viſit the widow (as then ſuppoſed) whilſt with that family they were mutually witneſſing grief, <hi>John Kennedy</hi> immediatly comes in; who had not been caſt away, but by a ſtrange providence the boat had been driven a far way to another place of the coaſt. Here, at once many mercies did meet; he vended the commodities of the ſhip; which having paid all his debt, returned him twenty thouſand marks more to himſelf. Thus was that <hi>bread, caſt upon the waters</hi> and to appearance loſt, <hi>after many days returned;</hi> and this witneſſed, that <hi>by liberal devices the liberal man doth ſtand.</hi>—I muſt add a word upon the <hi>death</hi> of this worthy man.

               <p>It is a memorable inſtance, known yet to many in the north of <hi>Ireland,</hi> of a choice and godly <hi>Gentle-woman,</hi> when the rebellion brake out there, <hi>who fled</hi> with ſome other perſons with <hi>her &amp; three children,</hi> one of them upon the breaſt: they had not gone far before they were ſtriped naked by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who to admiration ſpared their lives (it is like, thinking that the cold and hunger would kill them.) Afterwards going on, at the foot of a river which runs into <hi>Locheach,</hi> others met them, and would have them caſt into the river. But this godly woman not diſmayed, aſked a little liberty to pray; and as ſhe lay naked on the frozen ground, got reſolution, not to go on her own feet to ſuch an unjuſt death: upon which having called her, and ſhe refuſing, was dragged by the heels along that rugged way to be caſt in, with the reſt of her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

A boat being at the river, all the eight naked and without meat are turned into that Iſland: where after four days ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſome of the company died for hunger and cold; but not this woman or any of her children, for ſhe <hi>lived by faith, upon the word of God</hi> and <hi>not by bread only.</hi> A day after, the two boys having crept aſide, found the <hi>hide</hi> of a beaſt, which had been killed, at the root of a tree; which the mother and they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get caſt over them, then lying upon the ſnow. The next day a little boat goes by, unto whom ſhe calls, for God's ſake to take her in: but they being <hi>Iriſh,</hi> would not. She deſired a little <hi>bread:</hi> they ſaid they had none. Then ſhe begs a <hi>coal</hi> of fire, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And thus with ſome fallen chips made a little fire: and the boys ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a piece of the <hi>hide,</hi> laid it on the coals; and began to gnaw the leather: but without an exraordinary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſupport, what could this do? Thus they lived ten days without any viſible means of help: &amp; that good woman profeſſed, it was by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>joy in God,</hi> that ſhe did live; nor had ſhe any bread, but ice or ſnow; nor drink, except water: but ſhe thought, God put more ſubſtance into it, and found it as it were clammy. The next day a boat carried her out, to the ſide of the Band water; where ſhe had yet been loſt, but that ſhe could not bear to ſee her children die, in her ſight: and though the two boys were young, and ſo ſtarved, that they had no ſtrength, ſhe preſſed them to go out of her ſight, under pretence of their ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome <hi>fire,</hi> and bid them bend their face to ſuch a quarter, where in that deſolate country ſhe knew they could have no fire; yet in ſuch an extreme leſt room for <hi>God</hi> to work their ſafety.

               <p>IX. There is a ſtrange paſſage of <hi>Judgment,</hi> that amongſt the memorable things of the providence of God I think worthy of inſerting; it concerns a <hi>Noble-man</hi> in our own country (whoſe name, with reſpect to his houſe, I forbear to mention) who for many years by blood and cruelty and oppreſſion made himſelf a <hi>terror</hi> in that place of the country where he lived. One day his ſecond ſon, who after ſucceeded to that houſe, by the death of his brother, found a letter ſealed and directed to his father, bearing the ſtile of his houſe, and without any ſuſpicion whence it came, carried it up to his chamber: which that Lord breaking open, found it of a ſtrange ſtile; for it had theſe words, <hi>I ſummon you—to appear before the tribunal of God, and there anſwer for your murders, oppreſſions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Subſcribitur</hi> DIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BOLUS, Upon which, he being inraged, drew his ſword, to have run his ſon thorow, ſuppoſing it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived buſineſs by him; but he eſcaped, and was forced for many months to withdraw from the houſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever upon the interceſſion of friends, his father did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to admit him again; but that very day, whilſt they were met on this account, that Noble-man waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hands in his bed-chamber (and one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants by) a letter from the roof of that chamber drops down upon his hands, ſealed and directed as before, which being opened, had the very ſame words of the former letter, with that dreadful ſubſcription, DIABO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUS. After which, by immediate ſtroke of the Lord's
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:005185_0481_1016DE5638A432C8"/>
hand, he was ſtruck with a remarkable infatuation, and ſuch an horror and fear upon his conſcience, that upon the appearance of the leaſt boy he would have fled, and with howling ſought to have ſheltered himſelf under a bed, and in this caſe ſhortly died; having been made a <hi>terror to himſelf,</hi> and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſon able to quaſh him, who made it his work to be terrible to <hi>others</hi> in his life. This (far from reflecting upon the houſe or family) with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the holding forth the holy and righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord, I could not omit to inſert the ſame, after ſome ſafe warrant, as to the certainty thereof, from thoſe I had ground to believe. (¶)</p>
               <p>SEVENTH Witneſs to this truth, that the Lord hath in ſo ſolemn and extraordinary a way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for his Church in theſe laſt times, is this; <hi>Thoſe great &amp; marvellous providences (which we may call</hi> Magnalia Dei) <hi>by which he hath witneſſed his truth, and confirmed the ſame ſince the breaking out of the Goſpel in this late raiſing of the Church from Antichriſt.</hi> For we may truly ſay, there hath not wanted a viſible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation from Heaven, and a convincing teſtimony by ſome great works of the Lord, to his truth, as well as in the primitive times of the Church.</p>
               <p>We do here underſtand by ſuch providences, thoſe wherein man cannot but ſee ſomething <hi>above nature</hi> and natural cauſes, yea, above the <hi>ordinary</hi> way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It is true, this is not the Lord's uſual way, neither maketh he uſe of ſuch a ſolemn teſtimony, but on ſpecial and weighty grounds; when the neceſſity of the Church calleth for it; whilſt he is about ſome extraordinary piece of work; or when the Goſpel cometh firſt to a

                  </gap>and that hath been long overſpread with darkneſs; when ordinary means of conviction are wanting; or in times of great oppoſition, when the commiſſion of his Servants needeth ſome extraordinary ſeal; in ſuch a time as that of <hi>Ahab's,</hi> when the People are made to halt betwixt truth, and a falſe way. Thus we find, the Lord did confirm the <hi>firſt</hi> breaking out of the Goſpel, and make uſe of ſuch a mean to ſpread the Chriſtian Church through the World: and ſhould this ſeem ſtrange, that in ſo great a change of the Church's caſe now in the <hi>latter</hi> days, when he was to raiſe her up, after ſo long a ruin and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whilſt Antichriſtianiſm ſo many ages had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſpread the face of the World, that he ſhould thus appear, and give ſome ſignal demonſtration of his power in behalf of his People, ſuch as we have ſeen with our eyes, and our Fathers did tell us!</p>
               <p>It is not miracles, or any extraordinary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, on which men ſhould reſolve their <hi>faith:</hi> nor do we here mention theſe, for laying ſtreſs, thereon in believing the truth. No, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> doctrine and cauſe doth lean on a ſtronger ground: it can with confidence appeal the adverſary, to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> thoſe divine records, which they do not pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. This, even this is the <hi>reaſon of our hope,</hi> which we offer to all that aſk for the ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there let the God of truth, who hath revealed his will and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers men by the written word, be judge; &amp; we ſhall demand no greater advantage or juſtice at the hand of our enemies. We know, miracles cannot authorize a lie, or be a ſeal to any thing repugnant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And truly thoſe <hi>lying wonders,</hi> which have been ſo frequent in the World, which the Apoſtle doth foretell, that ſuch an engine the Devil will make uſe of, to turn men aſide from the truth, beſides other marks of their falſhood, they have this one moſt diſcernable, that they are the ſupport and warrant of
<pb n="448" facs="unknown:005185_0483_1016DE58ED1221B8"/>
that which cannot <hi>ſtand with the Word:</hi> and thence are the <hi>Popiſh miracles</hi> made uſe of, to confirm <hi>ſuch tenets,</hi> which of all their doctrine do moſt direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradict the <hi>Scripture,</hi> as the merit of works, purgatory, praying for the dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as we will not boaſt of ſuch, as the authority or proof of our doctrine: ſo we judge it a grave and concerning duty, to <hi>obſerve the wondrous works of the Lord</hi> in our times; yea, to make a <hi>diligent ſearch</hi> therein, that we may tell poſterity ſome of theſe <hi>great acts</hi> of our God, for his Church, in bringing her again from <hi>Babel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would deſire to be very tender and cautious up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a ſubject: for I judge it horrid divinity, to make a <hi>lye for God.</hi> It is not the truth, but a falſe way which requireth ſuch a help. And truly as to theſe following inſtances (which are but a few of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that might be brought, if there were more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enquiry) I dare atteſt the Lord, the great witneſs, that I have not knowingly ſet down here any thing falſe; yea, not without ſome diligent ſearch, and ſatisfying grounds about the certainty thereof. I judge it not neceſſary, to repeat thoſe which are ſo known already to the World from publick records: and therefore ſhall but briefly point at ſome of theſe, and add a few more particular inſtances of this kind, which I may with ſome confidence bring to the light, from clear evidences of the truth thereof.</p>

in that town, had ſhewed him from ſome who were moſt conſiderable there, as he ſets down in his Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> the IX. of <hi>France,</hi> who was author of that horrid Maſſacre, where the blood of many thouſand Proteſtants at <hi>Paris</hi> and other parts was ſhed, did a very little after die in the ſtrength of his years, by an extraordinary effuſion of blood from all paſſages of his body, that as <hi>Du Serres</hi> and other french writers of that time do ſhew, he was made to wallow in his own blood before his death. O was not this the very <hi>finger of God,</hi> a moſt convincing ſtupendious piece of his judgment?</p>
               <p>What an extraordinary providence was that, which is atteſted by divers witneſſes thereto, in the late bloody Maſſacre of <hi>Ireland;</hi> a young woman, who by the Iriſh was ſtript almoſt naked, and after by one of them threatned, that except ſhe would give him her money, he would forthwith run her thro'; to which ſhe gravely anſwered, <hi>I know you cannot kill me, except God give you leave.</hi> Whereupon he did three times with his ſword run at her naked body, but could not once pierce her ſkin; which did ſo confound this wretched man, that with a kind of horror he went away, and ceaſed to trouble her further.</p>
               <p>Did not God wonderfully appear in the raiſing of the late King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with that aſtoniſhing ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, which did ateend him in breaking the power of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whilſt they were at ſo great an height, and had their hands hot reeking in the blood of the Proteſtants thro' <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and other places of <hi>Germany!</hi> O but the Lord's hand might be clearly ſeen in acting forth and fitting that party of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> for ſuch a piece of his ſervice, even in a more than ordinary way; who like that <hi>He-Geat,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Daniel,</hi> did come ſo ſwiftly, that they tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

not the ground, as it were; but like a mighty Torrent bare down all before them.</p>
               <p>The breaking of that great <hi>Spaniſh Armado</hi> in the Year 88. which had been 3 Years in contriving, did convincingly witneſs a divine hand oppoſing the ſame. And how remarkable was that iſſue of all the Counſels, expence, and cruelty, which <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond had made uſe of to bear down the riſing of the Goſpel in the <hi>Netherlands!</hi> For it is notorious, that after many eſſays the loſs of an 100 Millions of gold, with near 400000 Lives, the reckoning of all his gain and purchaſe was only the loſs of a conſiderable part of theſe countries, and helping forward the eſtabliſhment of the united Provinces. And truly we muſt ſay the Lord did by his great and outſtretched hand won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully appear in raiſing that Common-wealth, ſo that they may date their flouriſhing in outward intereſt from their owning of the intereſt of God. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion did raiſe them, and no People this day hath more cauſe, and are under greater engagements, to be zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the truth, and defence of the Proteſtant Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The breaking of that formidable league of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks in <hi>France,</hi> for rooting out the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion there, was very wonderful, how all their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and deſigns ſhould reſolve in their own ruin; ſo that the moſt ordinary lookers on could not but ſee a divine hand counteracting the ſame. <hi>Davila,</hi> tho' an adverſary, in ſetting down that hiſtory, giveth a large account of this.</p>
               <p>What a great appearance of the Lord's hand, yea, of an extraordinary providence, was there in the throwing down of the <hi>Popiſh images</hi> and <hi>altars,</hi> almoſt in one night, thro' much of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which for ſo many 100 years had been made uſe of for Idolatry? O did not Satan thus <hi>fall as Lightning from Heaven!</hi> it being very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

impulſe did carry out the People in this over all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties or fear of hazard, what a wonderful conſent and agreement amongſt places ſo remote, about one thing, and almoſt at one time; how quickly alſo was it executed through theſe Provinces, almoſt in an inſtant! The authors did never appear, nor any noiſe of their boaſting thereabout; and which was ſtrange, the Magiſtrates of the cities having both power and will to hinder, yet were ſo overruled and ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, that they could not reſiſt. And as <hi>Famianus Strada,</hi> a great enemy to the truth, doth ſhew what fell out in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and other places, conſidering the greatneſs of the work, the multitude, and height of thoſe idolatrous monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it might have been enough for many days, what was done in one night; and yet not any in the leaſt prejudiced or hurt thereby, which made him cry out, that ſure this was the work of the Devil, and his help eminently therein. But I do not wonder, to hear theſe in ſuch a manner blaſpheme, whilſt they are tormented with ſo clear a diſcovery of God's hand againſt them.</p>
               <p>Muſt we not here mention that great deliverance of the town of <hi>Leyden</hi> from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with a ſpecial remark, whilſt it was then manifeſt, if the enemy had made uſe of Cannon in battering the walls, they could not have come ſhort of their deſign? In what an extraordinary way alſo were the winds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined to raiſe the waters, in order to the town's relief, when they were at the utmoſt extremity; yea, for driving the waters back again, when the town was once delivered; and which was very marvellous, that the ſame night wherein the <hi>Spaniard</hi> were forced to retire, a part of the walls fell down, which if it had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>What wonderful providences did attend the actings of that poor handful of proteſtants in the Valleys of <hi>Piemont,</hi> for their neceſſary ſelf-defence! Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> and other writers, give a clear account in ſetting down that horrid perſecution, which they endured in the year 1555. I ſhall here only touch ſome paſſages men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Mr. <hi>Morland,</hi> in his Hiſtory; who upon the account of that bloody Maſſacre, which was there within theſe few years, was then near that place, and from ſure knowledge and information doth very gravely hold forth the ſame. And truly they are providences ſo marvellous and aſtoniſhing, that men cannot but ſee the Lord in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way helping that poor People, his acting forth a ſew to do ſuch exploits, beyond any thing that can be mentioned of thoſe great Heroes, whom the World in former years did admire; ſo that we muſt ſay, as this was a convincing proof of the great power of God, put forth for his People, when help in an ordinary way failed, it was alſo a ſolemn teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to their cauſe, and of the Lord's approbation of his People ſtanding for their own defence, againſt the cruelty and violence of a perſecuting Magiſtrate. We have there held forth, how after that bloody perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, by an order from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> a ſmall number was in a remarkable way raiſed up, and upon their firſt eſſay 7 or 8 under the conduct of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentleman <hi>Joſua Gianavel</hi> (whom God made uſe of as a choiſe inſtrument, to help that poor ſcattered rampant) was made to fight 300 ſouldiers, who were ſent to exerciſe further cruelty in that place, killing many of them, and purſuing the reſt for a conſiderable time. After, a party of 500 being ſent by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſe of <hi>

                  </gap>, were oppoſed by 11 of the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="454" facs="unknown:005185_0489_1016DE6116890EE8"/>
and other 6 with ſlings: and after a ſhort conflict, were forc'd to flee with a conſiderable ſlaughter; the terror of the Lord upon the one, and a ſpirit of courage &amp; reſolution in the other being very manifeſt. After theſe, there was an other party ſent forth of 700 ſouldiers, to ſeize on all the paſſages: upon which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 17 Maſters of families, whoſe hearts God had in ſignal manner ſtrengthned to the battel, for their poor brethren's preſervation, reſolved to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Lord for the ſucceſs of their undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and with ſuch marvellous boldneſs faced their adverſaries, as put them in amazement, and made them draw off, reſolving to take another way; but were ſtill purſued by this little handful, who killed many without the loſs of one man. At an another time the Proteſtants there joyning in a greater number, being 300 under the conduct of the forementioned Captain <hi>Gianavel,</hi> were aſſaulted by 2500 of the adverſaries: but the Lord ſo ordered, that this little party getting the advantage of the place, after ſome conflict did force then to retire, purſuing them into the woods and ſteep rocks with great ſlaughter; and thus with a marvellous courage in a continued fight for eight hours together, did drive the enemy before them. Divers other remarkable paſſages of this kind are more at length mentioned in that Hiſtory; which the Author, after moſt exact ſearch and enquiry, doth ſolemnly atteſt. And truly it might be much cauſe for wonder (as it is there obſerved) that through the Lord's eminent appearance, and his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on his poor people's endeavours, for the intereſt of Religion, and their own preſervation, they did in a ſhort time diſpute the matter with ſuch a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſucceſs, againſt all the forces, which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> ſent, that their enemies at laſt began to fear what effect it might produce: and therefore having no better game to play, were glad by a
<pb n="455" facs="unknown:005185_0490_1016DEA9F22A7010"/>
treaty of peace, to get the ſword out of their hands; however they pretended it as a complement, put on neighbouring Princes, who did interceed for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Have we not alſo to reckon among the great works of the Lord in theſe laſt times, <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. of <hi>England,</hi> moſt violent in oppoſition to the truth, who by the Pope was ſtiled <hi>Defender of the Faith,</hi> upon that account, and for his writing againſt <hi>Luther:</hi> and yet the ſame man ſhall be the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made uſe of by the Lord, to throw down the Pope, and his power in his Dominions, and give ſome beginning to a great Reformation of the Church there.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vergerius,</hi> the Pope's Nuncio, for many years in <hi>Germany,</hi> whilſt he is writing againſt this truth, is even then converted, and forced to yield to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſame, turns Proteſtant, and a zealous Preacher of the Goſpel to his death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galeacaeus Carracciolus,</hi> an Italian Marquiſe, of great place and eſtate in the World, was ſo taken by the heart with one word, hearing <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> as made him quit not only all his hopes of preferment, a moſt pleaſant place as was in the earth, and a great inheritance; but to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the moſt preſſing intreaties and inſinuations of his friends, the weeping cries of his Lady and Children, and go to a ſtrange place quitting all, that he might preſerve his conſcience, and enjoy fellowſhip with the Church. O what a ſolemn witneſs was this to the truth, and of the conquering power of Chriſt!</p>
               <p>And in a word, what a marvellous thing was it, that poor <hi>Luther,</hi> againſt whom ſo much of the World was aloft with greateſt rage and violence, ſhould yet live to an <hi>old age,</hi> and <hi>go to the grave in peace!</hi> And truly the ſpirit and appearance of this great and
<pb n="456" facs="unknown:005185_0491_1016DE62B64CD548"/>
firſt witneſs to the truth, might be a convincing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the Lord was then about to <hi>raiſe up a people to himſelf,</hi> in whom he would be glorified, by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive teſtimony, as well as by ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe inſtances, I would here mention ſome remarkable providences, worthy indeed to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tho' they are little known to the World: which, we may ſay, do not only witneſs the power of God, but are a convincing ſeal to his truth, and the Church's Reformation in theſe laſt times.</p>
               <p>It is a remarkable paſſage, which worthy Mr. <hi>Forbes</hi> ſets down under his hand, whilſt he was baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the truth; whoſe words are theſe. In the year 1607. being at <hi>Ruan</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and meeting with <hi>Monſieur Figureus,</hi> that ancient and famous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and then Paſtor of the Reformed Church in that city, he had from him this following relation. After the cloſe of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> in the time of <hi>Pius</hi> the V. there was a conſultation in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the Pope and Cardinals, for an utter extirpation of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches in <hi>Europe:</hi> and to this end every Prince, of the Romiſh Religion, had a certain part aſſigned where this great project ſhould be put in practice: The death of <hi>Pius</hi> the V. hindred a preſent proſecuting of this deſign. And his ſucceſſor <hi>Gregorins</hi> XIII. did ſuffer it to lie dead, having no heart that way; and ſo until that time of <hi>Clemens</hi> VIII. it was not revived; but then this bloody reſolution was of new ratified by him and his Cardinals, under their hands and ſeals. The only difficulty was in this, to find a fit and truſty perſon, whom they ſhould make uſe of to the Princes of the <hi>Romiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Religion, for engaging them to ſubſcribe the ſaid ordinance, and ſet about the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof. At length a Gentleman of good parts, near in blood to the Cardinal <hi>

Religion. But this grief in his countenance and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage put his friends, who obſerved the ſame, to ſtrange tho'ts; and ſo much the more, that he did expreſly declare to ſome of thoſe who aſked thereabout, that what to them ſeemed a cauſe of rejoicing, was to him a juſt occaſion of grief. Yet at laſt finding his haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, upon a bitter challenge from the foreſaid Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal who had heard thereof, he judged it his wiſdom to diſſemble: ſhewing him, his unſuitableneſs to ſo great an employment could not but be ground of trouble and fear; and ſo was ſomeway forced to engage, getting his commiſſions, the decree of the Conclave, with letters to the foreſaid Princes, ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſubſcribed. But lo! whilſt this poor Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is on his journey, having found ways to free himſelf of his ſervants and other company, his ſpirit was in great perplexity betwixt theſe two grievous temptations, either to be inſtrument of utter ruin to the truth and Churches of Chriſt, or to forſake his country, inheritance and all he had in the World. Upon which he reſolved to retire himſelf out of the high way to an obſcure village, where for three days he gave himſelf to faſting and prayer for direction and reſolution from the Lord: and after this had his heart ſo ſtrengthned againſt the care of his worldly eſtate, that he reſolved to forſake all, and to reveal this bloody conſpiracy to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, and caſt himſelf on God's hand for his future ſtate. So that he turned his face from <hi>Spain,</hi> and took journey to <hi>France,</hi> and to <hi>Paris,</hi> where at that time remained the ſiſter of <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Princeſs, afterwards Dutcheſs of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> to whom the foreſaid Monſieur <hi>Figureus</hi> was her prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher: and unto him he made his addreſs (tho' after divers refuſals of admiſſion upon ſuſpicion) ſhewing him the whole buſineſs, and delivered the ſealed decree, with his letters of commiſſion for that effect; and
<pb n="458" facs="unknown:005185_0493_1016DE68716278A8"/>
did likewiſe ſhew him (who was then aſtoniſhed at ſuch a wonderful providence of God, in foſtering ſome of his own Children in the midſt of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that to ſo comfortable an uſe for his Churches ſafety) that there were many others in <hi>Italy,</hi> yea, in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, of the Reformed Religion, who had their ſecret meetings, and even <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII. before his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Papacy, was throughly clear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about in his judgment, whereof he gave him divers evidences. This foreſaid relation did ſo affect Mr. <hi>Forbes,</hi> that he ſhewed his marvellous deſire to ſee that man who had done ſo worthy and gracious a work for the glory of God and good of his Church; and by a recommendation from Monſieur <hi>Figureus,</hi> he did afterwards go of ſet purpoſe to that place, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt opportunity for <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> where this Gentleman was then retired for his further ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and honourably entertain'd by that Prince, where he ſheweth that he ſaw him, and from his own mouth received the aſſurance of this former narration, to his great ſatisfaction and comfort. This is the very ſum, which I have here ſet down and truly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed off the orginal; which I had beſide me, both written, and ſubſcribed, by Mr. <hi>Forbes</hi> his own hand.</p>
               <p>A remarkable providence I ſhall alſo here ſet down which was attended with ſome very convincing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, at the Parliament 1621. at their bringing in of <hi>Popiſh Ceremonies</hi> upon the Church, which was then a ſad ſtep of the land's defection from the truth, contrary to their engagements; whilſt the faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt at that time did with greateſt ſeriouſneſs and freedom obteſt and warn thoſe who were in power (alaſs! that now there is little of ſuch a Spirit appearing) that they would not, to pleaſe men, corrupt the Worſhip of God: but the current being violent, it did at laſt reſolve in a <hi>Law.</hi> At which
<pb n="459" facs="unknown:005185_0494_1016DEAE3465DD38"/>
very time, whilſt the <hi>King's Commiſſioner</hi> did riſe from the throne to ratify this woful act, by the touch of the Scepter, even in this moment of that rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, the God of Heaven ſent extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>lightnings,</hi> with very unuſual great claps of <hi>thunder,</hi> and theſe followed with a moſt ſtrange and extraordinary <hi>darkneſs,</hi> which both for the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs and greatneſs of the ſame did aſtoniſh and affright all who were preſent; and after all ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a downpouring of <hi>rain,</hi> as made the ſtreets to run like a river, impriſoning the Lords within that houſe for an hour and an half. And truly as we are not hereon to lay ſtreſs, or be peremptory in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of particular providences, yet this was ſo very convincing, as ſhould not be paſſed without a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial remark; conſidering (firſt) how at that time many of the choice <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Land were together near the town, at <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> bewailing before the Lord ſuch an avowed defection from the truth—(2.) That likewiſe this horrid tempeſt and darkneſs appeared to thoſe who were at ſome diſtance to be moſt directly above the town, the darkneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowing that part only, and was not ſo in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places—(3.) That they had, by the inſtigation of the Prelates, <hi>guarded</hi> the entry to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that day, leſt any Miniſters ſhould have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred a proteſtation in behalf of the Church againſt theſe Articles; and thus thought themſelves ſecure from any <hi>oppoſition</hi> of that kind: but whilſt they leaſt ſuſpected, they are met with a more publick and viſible witneſs from <hi>Heaven</hi> againſt the ſame.

               <p>The breaking of that journey to <hi>New-England,</hi> which about the year 1636. was ſeriouſly intended by ſome of the choice Miniſters and Chriſtians in <hi>Ireland;</hi> who were then much perſecuted by the Prelates, tho' not from any fear of their own ſufferings, but with a reſpect to a further liberty to ſerve the Lord in the work of the Goſpel, when that door was ſhut upon them in their own country. This was truly a ſtrange and remarkable providence, and their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in ſome kind miraculous: about which theſe circumſtances are worthy to be obſerved. (1.) That whilſt their <hi>veſſel,</hi> amidſt a tempeſtuous ſea, and far from any land, was like a riddle with ſo many lakes; yea, the rudder of the Ship breaking, ſo that the <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> were turned wholly hopeleſs, and could not ſee any ground of ſafety in an ordinary way, a <hi>poor ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> by a remarkable providence, whoſe company they had much ſhunned, was made the inſtrument of <hi>preſerving</hi> the whole veſſel, with a marvellous dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity faſtening the rudder (which others had given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) as one viſibly ſent by the Lord for that end.—(2) The ſtrong <hi>perſwaſion</hi> that ſome of theſe worthy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters had of their <hi>ſafety,</hi> which with great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they declared before the paſſengers; whilſt the Maſter and others were giving it over as a hopeleſs buſineſs, and ſeeing a convincing neceſſity for a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> though it was very aſtoniſhing and bitter at the firſt look, yet was afterwards followed with a <hi>clear diſcovery from the Lord,</hi> as one of them with much freedom did expreſs his aſſurance to the reſt of his brethren, that ſince the Lord would not accept their ſervice in <hi>America,</hi> they ſhould not <hi>want work</hi> and <hi>ſervice,</hi> where he was ſending them back by ſo remarkable a providence: as within a ſhort time was evident, the downfall of the <hi>Prelates</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi>
                  <pb n="461" facs="unknown:005185_0496_1016DEAFCDCC2290"/>
and after in <hi>Ireland,</hi> falling out ſhortly upon the back thereof. So that it may be ſaid, this was a convincing preſage thereof, the Lord by a ſtrong hand bringing back ſuch choice and uſeful inſtruments, for that great harveſt, which did after follow: So that they could not but ſay, The Lord did in a very marvellous and immediate way appear in that croſs-wind and ſtorm; and thereby, as if with an audible voice, did witneſs his mind in ſuch a diſappointment.—(3) It was alſo moſt obſervable, that none of thoſe, who on the account of their conſciences (that they might enjoy the purity of the ordinances) went in that journey, were the worſe, but had a ſafe <hi>return;</hi> only ſome perſons, who upon another account, expecting a fat ſoil and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantage in that place, and had unexpectedly ſlipt into the veſſel, did all <hi>die</hi> upon the ſea, ſave one, being 5 in number: and it was alſo wonderful, upon their return, how the Lord as he had <hi>ſtayed the rage of the ſea,</hi> did alſo <hi>ſtill the tumults of people;</hi> which they found by experience, ſo that it did evidently give a daſh, and became a terror to their adverſaries.</p>
               <p>I muſt here alſo ſet down a very ſingular and ſtrange inſtance, we may ſay, both of <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>mercy,</hi> which was in this land not many years ago. A Gentleman, whoſe ſtyle was <hi>Waſtraw,</hi> a moſt bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy man, and otherways notorious for profanity, but moſt in this, that it was his great work and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to put difference betwixt men, and as it was at that time very eaſy to engage them in blood, whilſt he had thus ſtirred up a neighbour-Gentleman to <hi>kill</hi> another in that place: finding him afterward ſore trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in mind thereabout, he told him, <hi>more</hi> of that <hi>practice</hi> would be the <hi>beſt cure:</hi> for he himſelf had killed 6, &amp; that the firſt time he was much diſquieted, but the longer he did continue, it became the more eaſy.

riding to a place, where two had appointed to decide a private quarrel by fighting, his horſe ſtumbles on the ſide of a ſteep rock, and he falls a great way down, his ſword falling out before him, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hurt: and here by ſuch a ſtrange piece of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence did the Lord ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And that day he died, having no viſible appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance thereof to thoſe who looked on, he was heard in his chamber at much wreſtling in prayer: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long continuance, thoſe of the houſe were forced to break open the door, getting no anſwer after long knocking; they find him dead in the room, but upon his knees in a prayer poſture; and the whole blood of his body, which from every paſſage thereof had iſſued out, flowing about him on the floor; it being viſible how all theſe paſſages were opened for that effect. A moſt aſtoniſhing inſtance! declaring this to the World; though God <hi>pardon the iniquity of his People,</hi> yet ſome ſins he will not let paſs without a viſible mark of his anger, but will <hi>take vengeance on their inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>

               <p>What an obſervable paſſage is that alſo, known to many yet alive, about a notorious <hi>robber</hi> in the ſouth parts of this land, called <hi>John of the Score,</hi> who for many years having driven that woful trade; did one day rencounter a poor man travelling with two hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which he according to his cuſtom takes away. The poor countryman falling down on his knees, did earneſtly beg, that for Jeſus Chriſt ſake he would give the one again, for he had no more to maintain his poor family, but what he could gain by them; but it was in vain. He carrieth them home with him,
<pb n="463" facs="unknown:005185_0498_1016DE6C9D5FBAC8"/>
leaving the poor man in that deſolate condition: but a little after, he turns dumpiſh and melancholy, could get no reſt or quiet, not knowing the cauſe but as he profeſſed, that thoſe <hi>words</hi> which the <hi>poor man</hi> had ſpoke to him (though he was ſo great an <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt,</hi> that he underſtood not what he meant when he ſpake of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) were lying like a heavy <hi>weight</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſpirit; and whilſt he was ſought after for his robberies, he deſired his ſons to ſhift for themſelves, for he could not go out of the way, there being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon him, and ſomething within him that in a ſort bound him from going out of the way: and thus ſtaid at his houſe until he was apprehended, brought in to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and there put up in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Upon which a godly Miniſter, Mr. <hi>Henry Blyth,</hi> with a Chriſtian Gentleman <hi>William Cuningham,</hi> Tutor of <hi>Bonitoun,</hi> who had ſometimes known him, make a viſit; holding forth to him his miſerable eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, and the hazard of his ſoul (for he was judged by the Law to die) and amongſt other words, ſhewing him the neceſſity to <hi>flee to Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he doth ſuddenly break out with a cry, <hi>O what word is that! for it hath been my death: That is the word, that hath lien upon my heart, ſince the poor man ſpake it to me; ſo that I had no power from that time to go out of the way.</hi> And after being told what an one <hi>Chriſt</hi> was, without whom he could not be ſaved, he crieth; <hi>O will he ever look to me! and ſhew mercy to one that for his ſake would not ſhew mercy to that poor man, and give him back his horſe!</hi> But after further inſtruction, a moſt real and gracious <hi>change</hi> did appear upon him; he gave moſt convincing <hi>evidences</hi> of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity thereof; attained to great <hi>aſſurance,</hi> before his death; and upon the ſcaffold, in the publick ſtreets where he was executed, did ſpeak ſo wonderfully of the Lord's dealing with him, and with ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and judgment, as left a conviction on all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,

               </p>
               <p>Another notable inſtance of <hi>grace,</hi> with a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage in his condition, I ſhall here mention, one <hi>Patrick Mackelwrath,</hi> who lived in the Weſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe heart the Lord in a remarkable way touched, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his converſion (as he ſhewed to many of his Chriſtian friends) was in ſuch a frame, ſo affected with anew World wherein he was entred, the <hi>diſcoveries of God</hi> &amp; of a <hi>life to</hi> come, that for ſome months together he did ſcarce ever ſleep, but was ſtill taken up in <hi>wondring:</hi> His life was very remarkable for tenderneſs, &amp; near converſe with God in his walk; &amp; which was worthy to be noticed, one day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſharp trial, having his only ſon ſuddenly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by death, he retir'd alone for ſeveral hours, &amp; when he came forth, did look ſo chearfully, that to thoſe who aſked him the Reaſon thereof, &amp; wondered at the ſame in ſuch a time, he told them, <hi>He had got that in his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Lord, that to have it afterwards renewed, he would be content to loſe a ſon every day!</hi> This one remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage I would ſet down: it had been long his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the want of <hi>memory,</hi> that he could retain almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what he heard from the word, &amp; bitterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining thereof to worthy Mr. <hi>James Engliſh,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Daly,</hi> his counſel to him was, when he heard any <hi>truth</hi> which he deſired to <hi>remember,</hi> to hold it up to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and deſire him to <hi>keep</hi> it for him, &amp; <hi>give him it back</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his need; which accordingly this bleſſed Man did with much ſeriouſneſs practice: &amp; on his death-bed, to his Miniſter, &amp; divers Chriſtians that were preſent, he did ſolemnly declare, how wonderfully the <hi>Lord</hi> had <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi> &amp; condeſcended to him in that particular. For as they knew how much formerly it had been his burden, the want of memory, now the Lord had given him back all thoſe truths that he had put in his keeping: ſo that what for <hi>many years</hi> before he had heard, was now moſt clearly bro't to his <hi>remembrance;</hi> which he witneſſed by repeating many particular truths, and notes of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which at ſuch and ſuch times he had heard.</p>

                  <pb n="465" facs="unknown:005185_0500_1016DEF48B905F78"/>
Now to ſhut up this, we have truly cauſe to ſay even from <hi>late experience,</hi> ſince this dark night came upon the Church in theſe Nations, with ſo ſharp a ſtorm of <hi>perſecution,</hi> there have not wanted ſome very ſignal and convincing providences, witneſſing the <hi>Lord's appearance</hi> for his people and againſt their enemies, which are worthy of a remark, and may let men ſee that there is <hi>One higher than the higheſt, who ruleth in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Children of men.</hi> For it is manifeſt,—</p>
               <p n="1">1. How eminently the Lord did appear in <hi>breaking that party,</hi> who had been the great inſtruments both in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil &amp; Action, to break the government of the Church of Chriſt in this land, &amp; lay ſo much of his vineyard waſte and deſolate, &amp; this in the height of their power &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whilſt they ſeemed moſt firmly rooted. O how evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was a divine hand there, that this <hi>Cabal,</hi> who made it their work to raiſe up <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and oppreſs the poor Church, &amp; like a violent tempeſt did carry all before 'em, in a moment when they could have left expected, ſhould be made to fall; yea, in ſo ſhort a time be turned out of their places &amp; offices, who but a little before had turned out ſo many of the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt! and that <hi>great man,</hi> who put forth his power &amp; authority ſo much to turn many of the godly of the Land, both Miniſters &amp; others, out of their houſes &amp; families; toſſing them from place to place, ſhould thus be dealt with from the Lord, and recompenced with that meaſure; being forced to quit his lodging once &amp; again, yea, even to baniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the country, who had been the chief inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to baniſh ſome of the moſt choice ſervants of Chriſt! &amp; this ſtroke alſo made to come upon them from that hand whence they could have leaſt expected, whoſe intereſt they ſtudied to promote in oppoſition to God's! I ſhould deſire to ſtudy ſobriety and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

2. Should we paſs without a remark, ſo ſolemn a witneſs from the Lord of <hi>his reſpect</hi> to his <hi>People's ſufferings</hi> in this late time? for it is known, with what marvellous reſolution and chearfulneſs, thoſe have been carried through, who were called forth to <hi>reſiſt unto the blood</hi> in their adherence to the truth; witneſſing to the conviction of lookers-on, even their greateſt enemies, ſomething above <hi>Roman</hi> Gallantry, yea, ſomething above <hi>nature,</hi> in that ſtayedneſs and elevation of their Spirits. And as ſome of all ranks in the land the Lord would have brought forth to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eal and witneſs his truth, and the work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: ſo it hath been alſo clear, that none wanted a large meaſure of ſupport &amp; ſtrength for the trial, their ſuffering ſtill giving a further daſh to their adverſaries.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is alſo manifeſt, and may be truly matter of wonder, by what a marvellous providence ſo many ſuffering and deſolate <hi>families</hi> have been carried through without any obvious noiſe of their <hi>ſtraits,</hi> now for theſe divers years, with ſuch convincing <hi>chearfulneſs;</hi> yea, the experience of many made to witneſs, that they never leſs knew a ſtrait, than ſince they were put from the ordinary means of their ſupport; and others who have been more ſharply tried, could not reckon any ſuch plunging ſtrait and difficulty, but have alſo found relief by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable providence occurring. I am very ſure, amongſt other advantages yet of theſe times, this ſhall be one, a large <hi>Regiſter</hi> of <hi>Experience,</hi> and remarkable confirmations of the truth of the word and promiſe, which the goldly have had under this ſharp trial; that will be ſweet matter for an after-reckoning, and a greater gain than any loſs their former ſufferings did occaſion. Yea, have we not ſeen, what in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way looked as irrecoverable, a <hi>ſtroke</hi> which a <hi>generation</hi> could not have made up, hath been a mean the Lord hath chooſed to promote <hi>his glory,</hi> and thereby declare himſelf to be GOD? Hath he not
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:005185_0502_1016DEF746DD1C50"/>
made us ſee, how eaſy it is for him to turn the ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt ſtorm to the great advantage of his Church, that he can act in deſperate caſes, above the ſkill both of Angels and men? And truly, though we ſhould be brought yet more low, even to the <hi>place of Dragons,</hi> this may uphold the ſhaking hearts of his People, and be ſolid ground of confidence, that Chriſt's po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and faithfulneſs is this day engaged for his Church, and truth! <hi>He muſt increaſe,</hi> his Kingdom is upon the riſing hand, and ſhall yet have a more glorious appearance in the World, whatever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of inſtruments; the <hi>reviving of his work</hi> is not in the reverence of men. And ſince we know, the Lord hath ſolemnly declared war againſt <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and all who will oppoſe the ſpreading of the Goſpel in theſe laſt times, yea, hath paſt his word to the Church for the fall and ruin of that adverſary, fall he <hi>muſt,</hi> though the duſt of the earth ſhould riſe for that end: and it is ſure <hi>Prelacy</hi> muſt alſo wither, that hath its life and ſap from that accurſed root! They have this day a <hi>deſperate cauſe</hi> in hand, who do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their power to ſupport the throne of the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> for they run in the way of the wrath and vengeance of the Lord, and ſhall ſurely involve themſelves in that ruin; though they were the <hi>greateſt Princes</hi> of the earth. I ſhall only add, we have much ground in theſe times to believe, that the Lord ſhall yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and make himſelf known in the earth, by as great and convincing providences, both of Judgment and mercy, as in any former ages, &amp; thus vindicate his glory, and refute the Atheiſm of this generation, by ſuch an argument, as ſhall force <hi>iniquity</hi> to <hi>ſtop its mouth.</hi>
               </p>

who is the <hi>God of truth.</hi> As a witneſs thereto is this ſmall eſſay directed, and now again comes forth to the World with an enlargment; Which I may ſay, was not intended, if there had not been a preſſing motive from the uncorrectedneſs of the firſt impreſſion; and for this I ſhall make no further Apology. But if a ſubject of ſo great an import, ſuffer no prejudice from ſuch an unfit pen, the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able teſtimony of men, or their cenſures, I ſhould deſire to look on (as they are indeed) at a diſtance, and far below that ſolid peace of the ſoul, which in the acceptation of God is alone to be found.

            <p>
               <hi>Inference</hi> I. Which we may ſee clear, is this, <hi>the great advantage a Chriſtian hath for his eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> that his ſecurity is indeed greater than his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or any thing he hath to adventure thereon: and ſure, that is not ſmall; ſince the matter is of no leſs earneſt (beſides his concernments through time) than an eternity, a <hi>Heaven,</hi> or the hazard of <hi>hell</hi> for ever. This muſt require a ſolid and ſure foundation, yea, we may judge, the furtheſt degree of certainty,
<pb n="470" facs="unknown:005185_0505_1016DEB8FB2B6A48"/>
where the ſuperſtructure is ſo great: for it is not opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or a probable conjecture, can be a ſutable baſis, to bear up that weight. But here, to anſwer ſuch an Intereſt, and give thorough quiet and repoſe to the ſoul, we have the truth and teſtimony of <hi>God,</hi> with this great Witneſs thereto, that it aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly takes place, and not one ſyllable falls to the ground, without an evident performance. There are <hi>two</hi> things, which, I am ſure, men could not with ſuch ordinary thoughts conſider, yea, nor think thereon without amazement, if they made it not their choice, to keep at a diſtance. <hi>One</hi> is, that ſuch a Thing <hi>is</hi> in the World this day as the very <hi>Word of God,</hi> that is more ſure than an audible voice from Heaven, to <hi>declare his whole counſel,</hi> and hold forth unto men the true way up towards that country; and does thus marvellouſly diſcover itſelf, (1.) To come ſo low, down, even his word and teſtimony who ſpeaks from Heaven, that therewith it hath a ſolemn appeal to men's <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> about its certainty. (2.) Which commends it ſelf upon the <hi>neareſt approach,</hi> and is found the more invaluable and of the greater price, the more it is <hi>ſearched</hi> into by an inquiry. (3.) That though clear and plain in it ſelf, yet by a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> light and evidence can only be known, which no humane ſagacity nor reaſon in its higheſt elevation, without this, can reach: but riſeth far above the greateſt capacity and endowments, of which by nature the moſt excellent ſpirits of men can boaſt.

O is it ſmall to be the <hi>ſon of a King!</hi> But the hope and claim of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> riſeth higher, and hath another reach; that ſuch within a ſhort time, whilſt now in ſo mean a garb, ſhall be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly <hi>entred into glory,</hi> in the immediate injoyment of God, and of the <hi>fulneſs of joy,</hi> among that trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſociety of the Angels, the Prophets, and Apoſtles, and all thoſe who are <hi>before the Throne, waſhed,</hi> and <hi>made white in the blood of the Lamb,</hi> and thus continue thro' the ages of eternity; yea, in that very inſtant of the ſoul's quitting the body, muſt admit ſo great a change, and enter there, where Heaven only can make us know what Heaven is! It is ſurely a <hi>ſtrange ſleep</hi> men are in, who in ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments are not awaked to a further inquiry. It were well, if ſome would but allow <hi>reaſon</hi> its true uſe (whilſt they travel betwixt the Poles, and can adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the furtheſt parts of the earth to purſue that which they muſt ſo ſhortly forego) to judge ſeriouſly and bring the thoughts of this near, what a greater intereſt, and at a more eaſy rate, and of an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly greater value, than that gold and treaſure which ever came from the <hi>Indies,</hi> does offer itſelf! I ſay the profeſt <hi>Atheiſm</hi> of ſome gives not more cauſe of wonder, than the ſtrange <hi>ſtupidity</hi> of others, and that common and eaſy way men have in giving an aſſent to divine truth: I do not mean, from the want of evidence and perſpicuity, but becauſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the things here held forth. This was not ſo ſtrange, that we find <hi>two of the Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt at a ſtand, from joy and wondering, to credit his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, even whilſt they ſaw it verified; ſo
<pb n="472" facs="unknown:005185_0507_1016DEBAFB41B168"/>
great was this in their eyes. Now to this, I muſt further point at two or three things, which ſeriouſly conſidered, may ſeem a ſtrange contradiction to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. (1.) how men can find a pillow to reſt on, who certainly know, <hi>their breath</hi> (for theſe few hours in in the night) <hi>is not made ſure;</hi> but if by a ſudden arreſt of death it ſhould be ſtopt, which is no ſtrange thing in the World, they know not what is next; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the next day in an irrecoverably loſt eſtate! Yea is not here cauſe of wonder, that whilſt we ſee time make ſuch ſwift diſpatch, dying men can be in that meaſure eſtranged from the thoughts of death; who ſo oft may hear it ſound, and the bell ringing for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yea, by previous aſſaults diſcern its approach on themſelves, which once come, then man goes off the ſtage, to return no more, nor ſhall he for all the ages of eternity ever act that ſcene of life here over again.—(2.) How ſtrange it is, that the <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> and certainty of the Scripture, that ſuch a thing <hi>may</hi> be, does not more alarm men, and mar their quiet; or that they can ſo much as think of an <hi>eternal</hi> eſtate without trembling, whilſt they are at no ſolid determination in ſuch a matter: yea, when the Scripture of God does not only witneſs a <hi>Heaven</hi> and Immortality, but ſhews the World, there is ſuch a thing as the <hi>firſt fruits</hi> and earneſt of it; whereof men here may be fully aſſured. I would know, if ſuch an Atheiſm is to be found, that puts the Atheiſt <hi>beyond fear</hi> and <hi>doubting,</hi> even in his moſt profeſſed confidence, and ſcoffing at the truth: or can ſufficiently ſalve that heart-aking and continued heſitation he is under, that ſuch a thing may be true.—(3.) I ſhall add, it is matter of wonder, men ſhould <hi>admit the report</hi> and atteſtation of <hi>others,</hi> about the truth and reality of godlineſs, who yet live <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to it <hi>themſelves;</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Inference</hi> II. Which from the Scripture's accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment is clear, is this, <hi>that there is a ſpecial debt on each Chriſtian,</hi> on whoſe ſoul the truth and faithfulneſs of God is ſealed, <hi>to give in his ſeal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and bear witneſs, that God is true.</hi> Thus is there a mutual ſealing; which is undeniably clear you ſee (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22.) the <hi>Lord's</hi> putting to his ſeal, which by all his people is well known: and have you not alſo (<hi>John</hi> 3. 33.) the <hi>Chriſtian's</hi> ſeal and witneſs moſt expreſly held out and call'd for? This is indeed a duty, in which (we may ſay) the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Saints bears his part, who hath that <hi>witneſs within himſelf,</hi> whereby he knows the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the words of truth: which is a great thing, that ſuch on ſolid ground can ſay, He does not more clearly ſee the truth, written <hi>in the Bible</hi> before him, than he knows and can read but by an other charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and engravening) this written <hi>within him;</hi> though none elſe can read the ſame, <hi>but he who hath it.</hi> I know, there is a debt to the leaſt <hi>Scripture-truth,</hi> which thoſe who profeſs the ſame, do owe, when a witneſs and confeſſion is call'd for, and hath thus ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial acceſs, in a ſuffering time, to ſet to his ſeal by a cloſe adherence thereto. But we muſt ſay, this is ſomething elſe, that concerns the <hi>confirmed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> as a peculiar debt he ows to the truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his God (which <hi>his ſoul knows right well,</hi> and hath had oft confirmed) to <hi>give unto him the glory of his faithfulneſs:</hi> We find <hi>David</hi> (<hi>Pſalm</hi> 89. 1.) thus ſpeaking, as one preſſed upon ſuch a duty. And though ſome have a more ſpecial call and greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to this than others; yet we may ſay, the confirming and ſealing of the truth is like a great
<pb n="474" facs="unknown:005185_0509_1016DEBEB80D80A8"/>
and publick treaſure, wherein the meaneſt Chriſtian wants not acceſs to caſt in his mite. Now for further clearing this, what the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s <hi>ſeal</hi> and <hi>atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth</hi> means, and what acceſs or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he hath for <hi>acquitting</hi> himſelf of ſuch a <hi>debt,</hi> I would point a little at, in theſe few particulars.—(1.) It is clear, that he who <hi>believes,</hi> and <hi>receives the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> does thus ſet to his <hi>ſeal,</hi> that he is <hi>true,</hi> and ſubſcribes (as it were) the truth and doctrine of the Goſpel. <hi>John</hi> 3. 33.—(2.) It is alſo clear, the ſhewing forth of the <hi>power of godlineſs,</hi> and the <hi>virtues of him who hath called him,</hi> is through the tract of a Chriſtian's life, a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and viſible witneſs thereto.—(3.) We may judge, the converted man upon that new and marvellous diſcovery, he hath got of the truth, upon his <hi>firſt</hi> entering into a <hi>Chriſtian ſtate,</hi> when he hath paſt that great ſtep, and is as one come into another World, hath <hi>then</hi> a ſpecial call, and advantage for ſuch a duty, that if it were aſked, <hi>What is the</hi> firſt <hi>ſervice ſuch owes to the truth?</hi> Is it not even this, to <hi>commend</hi> by his ſeal and teſtimony to <hi>others,</hi> what <hi>God</hi> hath ſo marvellouſly <hi>commended to his ſoul?</hi> And thus needs not want acceſs to let the World know, who may wonder at ſuch a change, that <hi>though once he was blind, he does now ſee;</hi> and aſſuredly knows, the truth is the <hi>power of God to ſalvation,</hi> which he no more believes upon the report and teſtimony of others, ſince now he ſees it with his own eyes. He then is to anſwer that call, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. <hi>When you are converted, ſtrengthen your brethren,</hi>—(4.) When a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is confirmed, upon ſome remarkable <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>ſtaggering,</hi> and hath got a <hi>new ſeal</hi> of the faithfulneſs of God, is he not under ſome <hi>new debt,</hi> to reſtore with advantage what he had taken from the credit of the truth, and give that good report and witneſs thereto, which may obviate any reflection he might
<pb n="475" facs="unknown:005185_0510_1016DF0228B9FEB0"/>
have cauſed by his faint? Sure it is, the Chriſtian's teſtimony hath then this ſpecial advantage, <hi>to confirm others in the way of the Lord,</hi> that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fears and ſhakings have been ſo diſcernable. Thus we ſee, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> after ſuch a remarkable plunge and fainting, comes in with his witneſs, <hi>Iſai,</hi> 38. 15. <hi>What ſhall I ſay? He hath both ſpoken, and himſelf alſo hath done it,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 31. 22. How concerned was he in ſuch a duty, <hi>I ſaid I am caſt out of thy ſight; Yet thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt the voice of my ſupplication.</hi>—(5.) When we ſee <hi>Atheiſm</hi> much <hi>abound,</hi> and hath a <hi>publick</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when it is not a <hi>particular</hi> truth, but the truth and faithfulneſs of <hi>God</hi> is challedged, we may judge, it <hi>then</hi> calls and calls aloud to the godly man, for his appearance, even by ſome more obvious <hi>teſtimony,</hi> than at other times, to ſo great an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Sure it is, when the lot of a Chriſtian is in ſuch a time caſt, and amongſt a generation of <hi>mockers,</hi> he will not want acceſs and a ſpecial call, by a chriſtianly grave and prudent witneſs, to own the truth, as that which he is obliged to ſeal, though there were none elſe; yea, we may think, this ſhould be a call and incitement, where zeal for Jeſus Chriſt hath got a command over his ſoul, as might burſt his tongue-ſtrings, which before were tyed, when the <hi>faithfulneſs of his God,</hi> which he ſo oft hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is by men brought in queſtion: which to <hi>David</hi> was like a <hi>ſword</hi> that thurſt him through, and he could not bear it when they ſaid unto him, <hi>Where is your God?</hi>—(6.) Upon the <hi>cloſe</hi> of ſome ſharp and remarkable <hi>trial,</hi> when the Chriſtian af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſtorm comes ſafe to land, ſuch a <hi>new diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> he hath of the truth and faithfulneſs of God, lays then a <hi>new debt</hi> on him, to bear witneſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Is he not thus concerned, not to leave the <hi>croſs of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> at a loſs, which hath left <hi>him</hi> at ſo
<pb n="476" facs="unknown:005185_0511_1016DEC1517767B0"/>
great an advantage; or part therewith without ſuch a teſtimony, that may endear the way of the Lord to others? Thus afflicted <hi>Job,</hi> after a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtorm, comes in the <hi>cloſe</hi> to pay the truth's rent, by his ſeal and teſtimony thereto. <hi>Job.</hi> 42. <hi>I have heard of thee,</hi> &amp;c. I hope, this debt in a large meaſure ſhall be yet found on many of <hi>this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> when this ſtorm is over, to preſs their ſpirits for bearing ſuch a <hi>teſtimony,</hi> that they <hi>thirſted not</hi> when he <hi>led them through the deſerts;</hi> But have oft there been <hi>ſurpriſed</hi> with his <hi>immediate help,</hi> to aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48. 21.—(7.) Is not the experience of a Chriſtian and thoſe grave remarks he hath of the faithfulneſs of God, a ſpecial <hi>truſt</hi> put into his hand, and a piece of <hi>his talent,</hi> that calls for his ſeal, as a <hi>rent</hi> which ſuch owe to the truth; and ſhould have ſome further reach, than his own perſonal eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment? I muſt ſay as to this, none of the ſaints want their peculiar engagements, which they may judge are upon them, even beyond others; yea, ſuch ſingular confirmations they have had of the way of the Lord, and oft with thoſe aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing circumſtances, that to ſmother the ſame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome gain and advantage thence paid in to the truth, might be reckon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſtealth from the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We may judge, ſuch a thing preſſed <hi>David'</hi>s ſoul for a vent, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 66. 16. And truly ſomething of this practice, managed with humble prudence, in a grave <hi>intercourſe</hi> and <hi>communication</hi> of ſome ſpecial confirmations of the truth, were a choice improvement of Chriſtian <hi>Society</hi> and <hi>fellowſhip.</hi> I confeſs, to manage this well, ſeems one of the moſt difficult pieces of duty, a Chriſtian owes to <hi>others;</hi> and I humbly judge, may be miſtaken, in its chief end by too much dwelling ſometimes on the caſes of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and debating theſe, to which their light and judgment may give more ariſe, than a preſent preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="477" facs="unknown:005185_0512_1016DF03C34E3CB8"/>
and weight of the ſame; the multiplying of which I have oft looked on as a darkening the ſolid and plain way of Godlineſs, and making it perplext and thorny, which lies in little bounds, when well underſtood. But we ſee what a ſpecial improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſtian fellowſhip is held forth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. for their mutual joy and eſtabliſhment in the truth, in a time when it was in queſtion; what advantage there is to ſerve the Lord. I ſhould wiſh ſo excellent a means were more direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this end: Nor ſhould this hinder ſuch a duty, that there may be an empty ſhow and counterfeit of that alſo, and the ſhalloweſt brooks ſometime make the greateſt noiſe.—(8.) Here is a ſpecial call for the Chriſtian's ſeal and witneſs to the truth, under ſome <hi>remarkable exigence</hi> and <hi>ſtrait,</hi> whilſt throng'd with manifold <hi>temptations,</hi> then is he concerned by his appearance to ſhew forth the faithfulneſs of God, and his teſtimony thereto; that may let others know, who in ſuch times will be great obſervers of his way, that he is ſatisfied with God, and with the ſecurity of his word, to reſt on, when he hath no reſting place elſewhere; that he thinks not his burden too great, to roll over on the promiſe; but hath this to ſay, in behalf of the truth, <hi>Perſecuted, yet not forſaken; caſt down, yet not deſtroyed.</hi> You may ſee the Apoſtle paying ſuch a debt on this account, <hi>Having nothing, I poſſeſs all things.</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 10.—(Laſtly) I muſt ſay, a call to this duty waits the Chriſtian in a ſpecial manner at the <hi>cloſe of his day.</hi> Then, O then, is he concerned to acquit himſelf of that debt, by commending the way of the Lord, and confirming others therein. Would it not be a choice appendix to the Teſtament and laſt Will of a dying Chriſtian, to <hi>ſeal</hi> with his laſt breath the <hi>faithfulneſs of God;</hi> and then when his words are of more weight than at other times, to bear this witneſs, that through the
<pb n="478" facs="unknown:005185_0513_1016DEC40D425920"/>
various ſteps of his life he knows <hi>God is true,</hi> and <hi>hitherto hath helped.</hi> It is ſure, the preſent day has its duty, and each remarkable time of one's life hath ſome proper work: But this, I muſt ſay, ſeems to fall in, as the laſt ſervice of a <hi>dying</hi> Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian to his generation, to deliver the truth off his hand, which he had received and oft proved, with his ſeal and teſtimony thereto: This were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>It is not here underſtood, that <hi>particular rules</hi> can be given for the practice of this duty: but Chriſtian <hi>wiſdom is profitable to direct,</hi> as occaſion offers, and the preſent caſe is circumſtanced. But ſure it is, each Chriſtian is thus a witneſs, &amp; as it were judicially fiſted in behalf of that Attribute of the <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> of God, to atteſt by his ſeal, as a confirmatory ſign thereof, that <hi>God is true;</hi> and as there is an <hi>implicit ſeal</hi> by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, there is ſomething more <hi>explicit</hi> then called for, in times which ſeem to evacuate the promiſe, when the <hi>reality of godlineſs</hi> is ſo expreſly impugned by the adverſary as <hi>fanaticiſm.</hi> And theſe things I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add; (1.) That thro' the whole <hi>Scripture,</hi> we ſee in frequent inſtances, how much the <hi>ſaints</hi> have been <hi>thus taken up,</hi> and in thoſe times of the Church, when there was not ſuch acceſs another way, to keep up a remembrance of the faithfulneſs of God, and tranſmit a teſtimony thereto, we find a <hi>pillar</hi> and <hi>ſtone of witneſs</hi> erected, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 12.—(2) Thus hath the Chriſtian acceſs, in the returns of <hi>thankfulneſs to God;</hi> no mercy being ſo ſmall, on which his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs is not engraven, as we find <hi>David</hi> often, and <hi>Jacob.</hi> Gen. 32. 10. And ſure it is, the diſcovery of this to an obſerving Chriſtian hath ſometimes a greater joy and ſatisfaction therewith, than the mercy in which it appears. I muſt ſay, it is a great de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ect in that excellent duty when ſome teſtimony to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God is not carried on therewith.—(3) Hath
<pb n="479" facs="unknown:005185_0514_1016DF06B04CCAB8"/>
not the Chriſtian an <hi>occaſional call</hi> thereto, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this lies in his way, to <hi>ſpeak to its credit,</hi> and bear his witneſs? We may ſee, the truth &amp; faithfulneſs of God came never <hi>David'</hi>s way, but we find him ſpeak honourably thereof, from the ſenſe of his peculiar engagements.—(4) There is no piece of a Chriſtian's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſtated on a <hi>particular truth,</hi> but a <hi>confeſſion</hi> is therewith called for of the <hi>faithfulneſs of God;</hi> thus to bear witneſs before the world, that he is not <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> nor is <hi>aſhamed of the croſs of Chriſt,</hi> becauſe he <hi>knows whom he hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inference</hi> III. From the Scriptures accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is this, that <hi>as there is a perſonal debt on the Chriſtian, there is a publick debt alſo on the Church, and a ſpecial truſt repoſed on every age thereof, to</hi> ſeal the truth, and deliver that great intereſt off its hand, to the ages to come, with a witneſs to the <hi>faithfulneſs of God.</hi> The Scripture herein is clear; yea, we have it in an expreſs propheſie held forth (<hi>Pſalm</hi> 145. 4, 5, 6.) that <hi>one generation,</hi> in a continued ſeries, ſhould ſeal the truth <hi>to another,</hi> and thus carry forward a witneſs to the ſame. For each time hath ſome peculiar rent, which it ſhould pay to the poſterity, from a new addition of the great and remarkable works of the Lord: and it is ſure, the greater things he hath witneſſed, by his more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent appearance for the Church, in one age beyond another, do add to this debt, and put ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engagements upon it, to <hi>record</hi> and <hi>tranſmit the works of the Lord</hi> and <hi>the memory of his goodneſs</hi> to after-times. Now with reſpect to this weighty truth, I would offer a few particulars (which this day, we may ſadly regret, are ſo much wanting) wherein ſome
<pb n="480" facs="unknown:005185_0515_1016DEC5B25669E0"/>
thing of this debt, that one age of the Church owes to another, in behalf of the truth, may appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may be judged a <hi>debt</hi> on the Church to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, to purſue that great intereſt of the <hi>truth,</hi> by an <hi>adding</hi> further, for confirming of the faith of the ſaints therein, from that diſcovery and peculiar advantages the <hi>preſent time</hi> affords: &amp; thus effectually endeavour to advance the repute and credit of the truth, on ſolid demonſtrative grounds of its certainty. This hath the greater call, when it is ſo much the work of the time and of not a few labouring therein, to <hi>ſhake</hi> &amp; <hi>unſettle</hi> men, as to this great foundation; yea, ſo much <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> that hath a viſible tendency to this end. One thing particularly ſhould be wiſhed, that the <hi>publick records</hi> of every age, as they concern the <hi>Church,</hi> did carry therewith more clearly ſome hiſtory of the <hi>veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the truth,</hi> by tranſmitting thoſe great &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous remarks of the <hi>way of God with the Church,</hi> to poſterity; by which the <hi>Scripture</hi> then hath been ſignally confirmed: thus ſhould one age declare its faithfulneſs to the next, which were a choice piece of ſervice, being gravely and with caution ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This <hi>debt</hi> does the Church owe to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with reſpect to the <hi>truth,</hi> to endeavour its tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting <hi>purely, and without hurt and prejudice.</hi> For it is to the Church, <hi>the Oracles of God</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; &amp; for that great truſt, muſt ſhe in every time be reſponſible. But as to this, I muſt ſay, <hi>that article</hi> of the truth of God, which is more <hi>ſharply aſſaulted,</hi> and hath endured <hi>greateſt oppoſition</hi> from the adverſe party, makes this debt the greater, to deliver <hi>that</hi> off her hand, with all <hi>care</hi> and circumſpection, yea, with ſome peculiar teſtimony thereto. It is true, there want not in every age ſome to appear upon the truth's intereſt; yea, it is a duty lies at each Chriſtian's door, when called to give a confeſſion of the ſame: but as
<pb n="481" facs="unknown:005185_0516_1016DF0ACFE1FE88"/>
no private appearance can anſwer to a publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and monument, it is thence clear, that in a time of great incroachment on the truth, when a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble breach is like to be made, and the aſſault not from a private adverſary, but a publick formidable <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination</hi> of a party, ſome more ſolemn authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and united <hi>concurrence</hi> is then called for, in the <hi>Church's teſtimony,</hi> for her exoneration; that with ſuch an advantage may witneſs to the ages to come, whereat their fathers left, how they held out, and wreſtled to keep their ground, in defence of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. This, we may ſay, is like the caſting up of a <hi>Bank</hi> to guard againſt a further breach, <hi>when the enemy comes in like a flood:</hi> and it is known, the <hi>confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church</hi> in every age, with ſuch a publick teſtimony to the truth, whilſt followed with viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hazard and ſuffering, have been more effectually ſubſervient to the truth's conſervation, than all the <hi>diſputes</hi> of men. Thus did they <hi>overcome</hi> (Rev. 12. 7.) <hi>by the blood of the lamb, and the word of their teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſpecial <hi>debt</hi> alſo is upon the Church, with a reſpect to poſterity, <hi>to contend for the truth once delivered to the Saints,</hi> and but once, ſince it can admit no change or alteration to the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord. O how bleſſed a debate and ſtrife this is, though in ſuch an intereſt <hi>reſiſting unto blood</hi> ſhould be called for! But whilſt I mention this duty, it cannot be underſtood with reſpect to that great intereſt of Religion only, or <hi>the weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law,</hi> that are more fundamental, whilſt under a profeſſed <hi>zeal</hi> to theſe, a <hi>latitude</hi> and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency in <hi>other</hi> concernments of the truth is ſhelter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is indeed ſtrange; though no ſtrange thing in this time. But let me aſk, can a piece of truth held forth in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> be of that low value, to warrant the quitting or yielding up of it if
<pb n="482" facs="unknown:005185_0517_1016DEC86B45C628"/>
brought in debate; when <hi>one line</hi> of this is of more ineſtimable worth, than the crowns and ſcepters of all the Monarchs of the earth? Sure it is, <hi>the God of truth</hi> hath prized it at another rate; who declares <hi>Heaven and earth ſhould rather fall, ere one tittle of his word periſh.</hi> And can thoſe, in <hi>greater</hi> things be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who are not thus in a <hi>little?</hi> It is too clearly ſeen, how ſmall a yielding makes a great breach. Truths comparatively ſmall may be great in their <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> when they are the <hi>word of his patience;</hi> yea, we may ſay, the leſſer it ſeems, and of mean value with many, it makes the Chriſtian's adherence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a greater teſtimony. It is clear, what a cloſe <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation</hi> there is amongſt the truths of God, held forth in the Scripture; that <hi>one part</hi> thereof cannot be ſtruck at, without a ſpecial prejudice to the <hi>whole:</hi> yea, it may be ſaid, every corruption of the truth hath an aim at the very <hi>ſoul</hi> of Religion, by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency thereto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a great duty the Church owes the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for which this day there ſeems a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary call, to ſtudy the tranſmitting of truth and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>not in a naked form only,</hi> but <hi>in the life and power thereof.</hi> Sure it is now too obvious, which gives ground both for grief and aſtoniſhment, that through a large part of the reformed Church, and in thoſe places where ſometime the truth hath brightly ſhined, with much ſtate and warmneſs; yea, where religion in its purity is yet profeſſedly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, and the worſhip of God owned, even there we may ſee the <hi>power</hi> and ſpirituality of this is a <hi>ſtrange</hi> and unknown thing: that by many within the Church and of ſome repute therein, it might be queſtioned, <hi>Is there indeed a Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and an <hi>inward</hi> teaching of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which by its working and efficacious influences is known upon the ſoul? Or, is there ſuch a thing as real <hi>fellowſhip</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="483" facs="unknown:005185_0518_1016DF0D5C1FF768"/>
with <hi>God,</hi> in the ſecret and the more publick du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Chriſtian, that is aſſuredly found? Oh what cauſe is there to fear, the ſhadow &amp; <hi>form</hi> will be quickly gone, when the <hi>power</hi> thereof is ſo great a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! I know, it is a ſore challenge, and may ſeem ſtrange to ſome. I do here profeſs, it is not to reflect on any place, or particular Church, more than another. But we may ſay, this want and decay is too great and univerſal to be hid; and now the tide ſeems ſo far ſpent and go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But ſure I am (I bleſs the Lord, without debate in this matter) upon a better warrant than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, our ſafety is this day to keep by the veſſel, and not part intereſts with an afflicted and almoſt ſinking Church; a <hi>publick Spirit</hi> may yet be found the choiceſt way to ſecure a <hi>private intereſt.</hi> Oh what do we ſee! Is not almoſt every where <hi>men's hands upon their loins;</hi> and ſo little inquiry in that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme exigence, what point of duty can yet be eſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to get <hi>religion</hi> up again, which now is at ſo ſore a backſet! We might hope, a great outcoming ſhould be, where little is expected, even upon a ſmall ſtirring of duty. Some things, I am ſure, are to be <hi>wiſhed,</hi> that would be of ſingular uſe to promote this intereſt: which I ſhall very briefly point at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It ſhould be wiſhed, this great mean of <hi>Prayer,</hi> yet left to the Church, were with more <hi>ſingleneſs</hi> and <hi>fervency</hi> improved, both by the Chriſtian alone, and in converſe with others. This is well known, in the moſt dark and diſmal times of her condition, what marvellous help it hath brought at an
<pb n="484" facs="unknown:005185_0519_1016DECC115397B8"/>
extremity, when it hath ſeem'd in ſome manner <hi>ultimus conatus eccleſiae,</hi> and all other things gone. O a <hi>ſpirit of prayer,</hi> what advantage hath remarkably followed upon this, to fetch the wind, yea, to get the veſſel as it were put on float, when it hath been a low ebb with the Church! To haſten her delivery, and in the mean time keep her wounds bleeding before the Lord! We may ſay, thus hath the meaneſt of the Saints acceſs to do a great piece of ſervice, even to the Church univerſal, and the recovery again of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs, that is now ſo far gone.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With reſpect to this, it is to be wiſhed, that a greater <hi>Correſpondence</hi> through the <hi>reformed Church</hi> were more effectually purſued; to know others caſe, what eminent hazzard appears to the truth, or ſore trial and aſſault that ſome particular Church may have beyond others; for witneſſing mutual ſympathy; for communication of counſels; the obviating prejudices and miſtakes; a grave incitement and upſtirring of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the duty of the time; and thus a further concurrence endeavoured, in promoting the great intereſt of the goſpel. Oh ſad, that ſince the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation brake up, ſo little of this hath been practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! but now much more gone, that except by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>travellers,</hi> or ſometime publick <hi>Gazzets,</hi> the great concernments of the neighbouring Churches, and the more remarkable occurrents of providence therein, are but little known. I ſhould account it <hi>a token for good,</hi> if ſomething of a publick Spirit, with reſpect to ſuch a mean, did more appear. We know not what advantage might follow this eſſay.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſhould be wiſhed, and might be a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and uſeful help, yea, of no great difficulty (now whileſt there is ſuch plodding in Religion, by airy notions, as if that great intereſt were the eſſay of men's wit and invention) to ſtudy the tranſlating of ſome of our choiſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> pieces, in <hi>other languages,</hi>
               <pb n="485" facs="unknown:005185_0520_1016DF0F19EE59F8"/>
which do moſt nervouſly hold forth the <hi>truth of godlineſs,</hi> both in its ſimplicity, and in the life and power thereof. Such as are moſt fit to put men on an other ſcent, for bringing the naked ſpeculation of truth down to that more near feeling, and abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſoul-converſe therewith; yea, ſuch as with greateſt clearneſs might ſhew the world ſomething of the ineſtimable advantage of that excellent ſtudy, how well godlineſs ſuits, and is a ſingular help in every calling and condition of men, to make their way eaſy and pleaſant, amidſt the plunges of their life: but eſpecially, that may hold forth the indiſpenſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thereof. It is ſad to think in what a meaſure excellent holineſs is wounded, and darkned by ſo great a cloud of prejudice, almoſt through the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church, which is much pretended, upon the extravagance and unſuitable practice of many profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame, and yet ſo little care to obviate and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I muſt further add what, I am ſure, is to be wiſhed, when ſo ſmall ground ſeems of hope therein, and calls now for much prayer, to ſee a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>faithful Miniſtry,</hi> given to the Church; of whom it might be ſaid; <hi>theſe are the Ambaſſadours of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with their Maſter's authority impreſſed on them; who in earneſt do <hi>travel in birth, to have Chriſt formed</hi> in their hearers, and preach with a feeling of that they ſpeak, to themſelves, as well as others; ſuch who truly <hi>watch for men's ſouls,</hi> with an awful impreſſion of that, leſt <hi>their blood be required at their hands.</hi> How great a bleſſing ſhould this be to a decayed Church, and what a ground of hope were it of a recovery! For its ſeen and clearly witneſſed, that connexion which is betwixt the Church's caſe, and the miniſtry thereof. Was it not ſeen at the breaking out of the Goſpel, and the marvellous ſucceſs it had in the beginning of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="486" facs="unknown:005185_0521_1016DECED7FAFA20"/>
after that long darkneſs under Antichriſt's reign, how choice and excellent a miniſtry was then ſent forth; yea, what a remarkable conſtellation of great lights did appear, who did both burn and ſhine in their time. Oh! Theſe are gone; and but a few (comparatively with that time) of ſuch a ſpirit now to be found: but this ſad remark we cannot ſhun, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>at the <hi>greateſt plague</hi> the chriſtian world and much of the reformed Church this day is under, is from the <hi>watchman;</hi> by whom the truth, in its power, hath been more <hi>wounded,</hi> than its moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed adverſaries. I know, there wants not ſuch a <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid party</hi> in this time, who take advantage to reflect on and decry that excellent office and appointment of Jeſus Chriſt for his Church, becauſe of the <hi>abuſe</hi> thereof; whom I dare not, from the aw of God, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in their dialect, which is only <hi>railing,</hi> and is all their ſtrength: but <hi>the Lord rebuke that evil ſpirit,</hi> now abroad in the world! Whilſt I ſpeak to that great advantage, the Church and the power of religion hath by a faithful minſtry, I muſt further add this, as a <hi>debt</hi> the preſent generation owes to the poſterity, to witneſs a particular <hi>care</hi> and <hi>reſpect</hi> to ſuch who are looking forth with ſome aim to this <hi>great calling;</hi> that in ſo ſadning a day <hi>theſe</hi> might be <hi>incouraged</hi> and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up (I mean where there is ſome promiſing appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) to follow their aim, and not faint, when difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſeem to grow in their way, and the ſickle now taken out of the hand of many faithful labourers; but eſpecially for their taking along with other ſtudies that more excellent ſtudy, <hi>ſanctification,</hi> which is ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary to make <hi>able miniſters of the New Teſtament.</hi> Sure thoſe have now a ſpecial ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to witneſs their love and reſpect to Jeſus Chriſt, who keep their face that way forward, when there ſeems no other incitement, but the ſervice of <hi>ſuch a Maſter!</hi> They may have a mean appearance,
<pb n="487" facs="unknown:005185_0522_1016DF11A90261F0"/>
and at this day conflict with many difficulties, on whom great ſervice may yet wait for the Church of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inference</hi> IV. <hi>It is a duty of ſpecial uſe,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a right underſtanding and diſtinct conception of the fulfilling of the Scripture, <hi>to diſcern the times and inquire ſeriouſly thereabout:</hi> ſince it is clear, that in particular ages and periods of time the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt take place, and the Prophecies thereof, which relate to each period of time, have their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and exact accompliſhment therein. It is ſure, this can be no matter of debate, that ſuch a duty is called for in ſo dark an hour upon the Church; yea, the greater the darkneſs grows, it ſeems to have a more preſſing call; when we ſee the clouds ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, that they are like to cover the face of the ſkie; the Church univerſal ſo ſore benighted, that ſhe hath almoſt loſt her way amidſt theſe miſts, and among the multitude of theſe by-paths: for then it is not only incumbent on the publick watchmen, but we may ſay, concerns the godly every where, to be on this account <hi>ſeers,</hi> to <hi>know the times, and what Iſrael ought to do.</hi> Sure it is, no Chriſtian wants his watch-tower, where he may get up, by a near converſe with <hi>God</hi> in the Scripture, and thence as from a great height conſider the preſent time; yea, have a clear view of the moſt ſtrange perplexing oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents thereof, how amidſt theſe <hi>his work</hi> about the Church keeps its way, and moves ſtill forward, without loſing of ground, and <hi>his truth</hi> does convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly take place.</p>
            <p>Now with reſpect to this I ſhall here offer ſome thoughts, what in ſo neceſſary a duty concerns <hi>the godly,</hi> and calls for their ſerious enquiry, for a right diſcovery and <hi>underſtanding of the time;</hi> and ſhall ſhortly touch it in a few particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="488" facs="unknown:005185_0523_1016DED29970C588"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is of great import to know from the Scripture, <hi>what of the night</hi> it is, how far it ſeems to be ſpent, and now <hi>in what watch</hi> thereof the Church is fallen, as to her preſent ſtate. For thus we might know to what period of her condition theſe great and remarkable things, which fall out in the World, do relate. This, I confeſs, Would be a perplext buſineſs, if the appearance of things were our guide, and wanted that bleſſed conduct of the written word, when the Church's way ſeems involved in ſo ſtrange a labyrinth. One thing is ſure <hi>that the Lord hath founded Zion.</hi> and is now <hi>building</hi> her up: which marvellous work cannot halt, but in all ages is in a continued progreſs, wherein the great builder, doth loſe no time. And from the Scripture theſe things ſeem clear and manifeſt,—</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as the whole <hi>election</hi> muſt <hi>obtain,</hi> ſo now are there a great many of that elect Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready entered into a <hi>triumphant</hi> condition, and are now got ſafe on ſhoar. There is this day a great and innumerable company of all Nations, Tongues and Languages, that were of old committed to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator's truſt, and to be brought forth under the times of the New-Teſtament, who are <hi>perfected</hi> and <hi>before the throne;</hi> after whom the Goſpel did follow, and made many a long ſtep to bring them in from the furtheſt corners of the earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This alſo is clear, that the Church <hi>militant</hi> hath now <hi>paſſed</hi> and is <hi>gone through</hi> that long continued and moſt diſmal <hi>trial,</hi> which under the times of the Goſpel and until the cloſe of time was to go over her head, even that ſore bondage from <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and under his reign. It is true, this adverſary does not ceaſe, nor give over the quarrel: for he wants not wrath, when his power is abated; and this day we ſee him in a great ſtir, to raiſe up that accurſed intereſt, and ſet it in its own place, that hath ſo remarkably
<pb n="489" facs="unknown:005185_0524_1016DF154E34DF10"/>
been brought down, and begun to fall before the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. But a ſtep further of that <hi>judgment</hi> (which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly is <hi>not ſleeping</hi>) will end the buſineſs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this is now manifeſt, that <hi>the Winter is paſt,</hi> and the <hi>Church's ſpring</hi> begun, yea, in a large meaſure ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; whoſe growth and tender bloſſom the cold nor ſtorm cannot blaſt, but muſt be ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient thereto, and haſten the <hi>ſummer</hi>'s approach.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon this inquiry, <hi>where the Church now is?</hi> and <hi>in what, or what manner of time, her preſent ſtate ſeems to fall?</hi> I think there are clear and convincing ſymptoms, by which ſome notable <hi>Criſis</hi> in her condition may be diſcerned: that after many conflicts, and ſore wreſtling, ſince her victory begun over <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi> this time of the Church ſeems to fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that more <hi>remarkable aſſault,</hi> which may be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for from this adverſary before the pouring out of the <hi>fifth vial</hi> on his throne and ſeat; which, as the preludium of ſo great a victory, may in ſome propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereto be more dreadful and ſharp, for a time, than any we have ſeen. I humbly judge, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture points clearly at this, which ſhews the wreſtling condition of the Church, and a <hi>war</hi> continued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Antichriſt and the Lamb,</hi> even in his falling ſtate, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 14.) until that laſt deciſion (which is made ſure in the Church's favour) put him off the field; <hi>For the Lamb ſhall overcome, and they that are on his ſide, who are called, &amp; choſen and faithful.</hi> And ſince it is thus, that the Church's intereſt is advanced, by the renewed aſſaults of that adverſary, ſhould it be ſtrange, that the ſeveral ſteps of her riſing have ſome conflict and oppoſition proportioned thereto? Muſt ſhe not be <hi>in pain and labour, as a woman in travel, for her bringing forth?</hi> Yea, do not the ſharpeſt ſhowers both preſage and haſten the delivery? For this doth the Scripture witneſs, which is written for the ages to come, <hi>Micah</hi> 4, 13. <hi>Be in pain, O
<pb n="490" facs="unknown:005185_0525_1016DED426BF6B18"/>
Daughter of Zion, and go forth unto Babylon, for there ſhalt thou be delivered.</hi> I muſt judge, ſo formidable an approach of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> this day, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage he ſeems to have, with theſe ſore ſtruglings of the Church of Chriſt, as in an extream betwixt life and death, do more promiſe, than threaten; and are a hopeful preſage of a further enlargement, and the bringing forth ſome great and important truth in its ſeaſon to a performance; yea, have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency, under the wonderful conduct of the bleſſed diſpoſer of theſe things, to help forward ſuch a mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This we may know from the Scripture, though now it ſeem a contradiction both to ſenſe and reaſon, <hi>that the Church's intereſt is on a preſent advance, and at this day on the prevailing hand.</hi> It is true, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the changes of her condition, and through the whole time of the New-Teſtament, this truth muſt be made out (<hi>Job.</hi> 3. 30.) that Jeſus Chriſt in his Kingdom <hi>muſt increaſe,</hi> even when choiceſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wear out, and to appearance are in a moſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing decay; that intereſt doth then <hi>flouriſh as the Palmtree,</hi> the more it is depreſſed; nor hath the Church bounds ſet to its continued increaſe, until it once come to the <hi>perfect day</hi> when <hi>the Kingdom ſhall be delivered up to the Father,</hi> and all powers ſubdued and brought under the <hi>Mediator's feet.</hi> But this riſe and increaſe of the Church, which is here underſtood, <hi>on the falling of Antichriſt,</hi> I muſt ſay, hath a further reach, and is in a more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>minent conſpicuous way pointed at in the Scripture, as that which waits on a more ſolemn and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able period of the Church's ſtate. It is true, ſuch hours may fall in, with ſome ſad intervals, in which ſucceſs and all advantage appears on the adverſaries ſide; for thus we find the Scripture point forth <hi>Antichriſt'</hi>s ruin, and the progreſs of his judgment
<pb n="491" facs="unknown:005185_0526_1016DF17E58393A0"/>
and down caſting in the various ſteps thereof, with a ſpecial reſemblance to the Lord's way with <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> of whom he appears to have been a type, ſuch judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſtrokes of induration on both, a gradual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure by one plague after another, with the ſame effect and product, to give the Church a new aſſault, on any favourable interval; until the great God <hi>make his power known,</hi> as once he did at the <hi>red Sea.</hi> For there we may ſay, did the Lord firſt found a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, with a ſpecial type of the great works and deliverances he would do for her in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and by this repreſent that marvellous ſtroke he is to bring on Antichriſt. It is not ſtrange, to ſee the truth <hi>brought down to the grave,</hi> yea, as it were <hi>buried,</hi> when even this thing, by the overruling pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of him who maketh <hi>all things work together for her good,</hi> is turned to her advantage, and tends to her riſing with a greater luſtre and brightneſs! Who could in an ordinary way judge the <hi>reformed</hi> Church then upon an <hi>advance,</hi> in the <hi>French maſſacre,</hi> the <hi>Catholick League</hi> there, and the <hi>Low-Country</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution by <hi>Alva?</hi> Yet theſe were an antecedent preparation to her further riſe, which a little time made appear.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This further I ſhall add as to the preſent time of the Church, which from the Scripture ſeems clear, <hi>that bleſſed and much longed for, and glorious day of the ſecond coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> (which, as the laſt period of the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all that is written, will once for all and for ever put a glorious cloſe to the Church's warfare; the ſouldier's ſword and helmet ſhall then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

his months and years, hath ſet time its glaſs alſo, and bounded the duration of this world, that it cannot continue one minute more? And tho' the particular time falls not under our inquiry, which the Majeſty of God hath concealed from the Angels: yet is this clear, there are <hi>ſigns</hi> given of its near <hi>approach,</hi> which in their ſeaſon will be diſcernable, though little noticed by <hi>the world;</hi> it being in ſuch a lethargy, and men then ſo thronged with the cares of this life, that theſe grave forewarnings will not rouſe them up. But it is evident, ſuch <hi>ſigns</hi> are <hi>not</hi> given <hi>in vain:</hi> for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Church</hi> hath a call to diſcern wiſely what appearance there is of the approach of <hi>that day;</hi> yea, on ſuch an account to <hi>lift up their head</hi> with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn congratulation. O what a marvellous truth is this, the ſerious thoughts of which might give men new ſubject for wonder each day, <hi>that the time is haſtening,</hi> when the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the Church ſhall <hi>appear in the clouds of heaven, in flaming fire,</hi> with an innumerable company of the <hi>Angels;</hi> &amp; now <hi>the duſt of the Saints</hi> hath not long to ſleep, before they be <hi>awaked,</hi> with that unſpeakable ſweet and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing ſound of the laſt trumpet! Faithful is he who hath <hi>promiſed:</hi> yea, for further aſſurance, we have a ſolemn <hi>oath</hi> thereto, by him who live's for ever and ever. It is long ſince <hi>John</hi> gave this warning to the Church, <hi>Behold, he cometh with clouds!</hi> and then did theſe primitive Chriſtians ſolace themſelves on that ground. Some few <hi>evidences</hi> of this day's <hi>approach</hi> with a ſafe warrant from the Scripture we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; which as the bloſſoming of the ſpring doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Summer is now near. (1.) If the <hi>whole days of the Goſpel,</hi> ſince that glorious triumph of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator in his ſuffering for the Church and his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, be upon the Scripture's reckoning <hi>the laſt times,</hi> we muſt then judge, <hi>the night is far ſpent,</hi> and <hi>the day at hand.</hi>—(2.) If in the days of the ſeventh
<pb n="493" facs="unknown:005185_0528_1016DF1A9CD414C8"/>
               <hi>trumpet</hi> the myſtery of God ſhall be <hi>finiſhed,</hi> is not this clear, that <hi>two ages</hi> are almoſt paſt ſince it <hi>begun</hi> to blow, under which the intereſt of the goſpel hath a moſt remarkable advance? (3.) If the laſt ſtroke and utter aboliſhing of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall be <hi>by the brightneſs of Chriſt's ſecond coming</hi> (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 8.) is there not ſolid ground thence to judge, this bleſſed day <hi>haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,</hi> when his falling is ſo far advanced? It is ſure, we have ſeen his Kingdom in a great meaſure darkned, <hi>his conſuming</hi> and mouldring down <hi>by the breath of Chriſt's mouth</hi> in the preached goſpel: and now wait in hope for that more remarkable ſtep of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Scripture, I think, gives as a near ſign of the coming of the Lord; even ſuch as the white ſkie and morning-brightneſs is to the watchman, of the days being near. And thus, as we ſee the ruin and downfall of the <hi>man of ſin</hi> advance, there ſeems to be a proportional ground of certainty thence to conclude the near approach of the day of <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second particular,</hi> which in our diſcerning the time calls for a ſerious enquiry is this, <hi>what the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent appearance and ſigns of the time ſeem to point at.</hi> For theſe, as the pulſe to the body, are of ſpecial uſe to give a clear diſcovery of its temper and diſpoſition but this is a prognoſtication, that goeth above the ſtars and all the rules of Aſtrology, which the Scripture only can make us know. I confeſs, this day they ſeem ſad, and every where look with a threatning aſpect on the Church. <hi>We ſee not now our ſigns,</hi> and thoſe <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens for good,</hi> which ſometimes have appeared: but there are preſages, if we could gravely look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that might cauſe us with aſtoniſhment to enquire, What can ſuch things portend, and when will be the end of theſe wonders? Some ſew I ſhall briefly point at, which concern this time; that if we be not much aſleep, might be very rouſing, and make us regard the ſame
<pb n="494" facs="unknown:005185_0529_1016DED89B99F2D0"/>
with an awful and humbling impreſſion; for they truly threaten: Yet I muſt ſay, with a reference to the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> &amp; upon an inquiry into that unerring record about their meaning?—<hi>Firſt,</hi> we have a ſafe warrant from them to conclude, that whatever may befal a particular Church, yet nothing thence can be concluded as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative of a mortal prejudice to the Church uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal. For tho' this or that particular Church may be <hi>cut off,</hi> and <hi>ſpued out of his mouth</hi> (as many have and moſt of the particular Churches may this day meditate terror: <hi>If he ſpared not the natural Branches, take heed left he alſo ſpare not thee,</hi> ſhould ſound an alarm to each Church; thoſe very things with highly aggravating circumſtances, being too obvious and eaſy to be found with them, for which he caſts others off) <hi>yet he muſt increaſe,</hi> and his Kingdom muſt be a <hi>coming</hi> Kingdom: Yea, when he ſeems to loſe ground in <hi>one</hi> place of the world, it is made up with advantage by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the ſame in <hi>another</hi> place; and often out of the very ruins and diſſipation of that Church which he caſts off, he carries materials to build him an houſe elſewhere. In which caſe we are, inſtead of a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous ſaying, <hi>Why is it thus?</hi> to adore and bleſs <hi>the glory of the Lord from his place,</hi> to juſtify his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedure, and be glad, that <hi>they to whom he was not ſpoken of, ſhall ſee, and they who had not heard ſhall underſtand.</hi>—Secondly, we may alſo ſay with the ſame warrant, that even a particular Church, which hath very death-preſaging ſymptoms, and ſcarce a token for good, <hi>can by him who healeth backſlidings and loveth freely, be recovered.</hi> He can make <hi>dry bones</hi> to <hi>flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> as a green herb: for the iſſues from ſpiritual death belong to him. He can make them who had fallen from their firſt love, repent and do the firſt works; whereby the <hi>departing of the glory,</hi> and the <hi>removing of the candleſtick out of his place,</hi> ſhall be prevented. I am ſo much the more preſſed to touch this a little,
<pb n="495" facs="unknown:005185_0530_1016DF1D654317D0"/>
becauſe the very few <hi>ſerious,</hi> who are yet left (or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from that ſpiritual ſopor and ſtupidity, which hath ſeiſed on others) while they lay to heart <hi>the things which concern the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are, upon the frightful aſpect of affairs and on the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what they obſerve in the temper of men and tendency of things, ready to <hi>caſt away all confidence,</hi> and abandon themſelves to a ſimple deſpondency: they almoſt queſtion, whether they ought to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any hope, that we ſhall any more be called by that bleſſed name, <hi>Jehovah Shammah,</hi> the Lord is there; ſeeing nothing apppears at preſent in the diſpoſition of men, or diſpenſation of God, which doth not ſeem to portend a final departure. Notwithſtanding whereof I would deſire ſuch, as to beware leſt in their heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs they <hi>limit the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the ſovereignty of grace within its juſt latitude and limits, ſo for their eſtabliſhment againſt ſuch a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency and for their excitement to a ſerious wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with him in order to his abode with us, to conſider theſe particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> We may call this one of the <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages</hi> of the time, that the <hi>Devil</hi> is now ſo much <hi>aloft,</hi> and <hi>in a ſtrange way beſtirring himſelf</hi> againſt the Church; to beget every where a <hi>prejudice at the truth,</hi> which this day by very remarkable effects of his power may be ſeen.—It is ſure, <hi>he</hi> is a bad neighbour; yet we muſt ſay, he <hi>endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the Church moſt,</hi> when becauſe he makes no great noiſe <hi>he is leaſt diſcerned.</hi> His being apparently <hi>quiet</hi> and ſtill hath been found in experience more fatal to the flouriſhing and real ſucceſs of the goſpel, than his <hi>rage;</hi> and in his <hi>feigned flight</hi> more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, than in his more furious <hi>aſſaults.</hi> But we have the Scripture to aſk concerning this; which makes theſe clear. [1] That his appearing with <hi>great wrath,</hi>
               <pb n="496" facs="unknown:005185_0531_1016DEDBA03456C8"/>
ſhews <hi>his time to be ſhort,</hi> and that it will be no continued or lying ſtorm, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 12.—[2] We thence know, his being let <hi>looſe,</hi> with a more than uſual liberty, to trouble the Church, is <hi>previous</hi> to ſome great and remarkable <hi>reſtraint;</hi> which you may read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.7, 8. where he is in a more ſpecial way let looſe, but we find <hi>v.</hi> 10. his being <hi>chained up for ever</hi> follows.—[3.] We may clearly ſee from the Scripture the <hi>Devil much aloft,</hi> with a more remarkable ſtir and noiſe, when ſome <hi>great thing from the Lord</hi> is to be brought forth for the Church. When the <hi>ſet time,</hi> that ſolemn and bleſſed time, was now come of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating by that <hi>one ſacrifice</hi> for ever the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, ſo that <hi>this hour and power of darkneſs</hi> did introduce an everlaſting ſun-ſhine upon the Church: and <hi>Satan,</hi> by purſuing the <hi>Prince of life</hi> unto the death, had a moſt fatal overthrow. For <hi>by death he overcame him who had the power of death, that is, the devil:</hi> and by being <hi>lifted up</hi> upon the croſs, he <hi>ſpoiled principalities and powers, trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing openly over them;</hi> and thus dying, ſung the victory, and ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed!</hi> whereby a victory over all enemies is eternally enſured to the ſaints. Yea, is it not clear, what an hot alarm the Church may expect from him, upon the approach of that great victory, and the deciſion of the <hi>laſt battle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>the dragon?</hi> ſee <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 9, 10. what an appearance he will then have, and in what a manner will he beſtir himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is not this a <hi>preſent ſign</hi> of the time, about which we may with ſome aſtoniſhment inquire, what it doth mean, and if it hath any favourable aſpect on the Churches, <hi>That we ſee almoſt every where the moſt united and formidable aſſault of the adverſaries of the truth;</hi> and its ſpecial arm at the <hi>kingly</hi> power and Supremacy of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> as Head over his Church: at which great truth the oppoſition of this time ſeems
<pb n="497" facs="unknown:005185_0532_1016DF2021F7DCA0"/>
moſt directly to be levelled; yea, we may ſay, the Crown of Chriſt which becomes him alone to wear, and this piece of his glory, is now betwixt <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and the <hi>Princes of the Earth</hi> divided, each contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his ſhare. Sure, this is too diſcernable: and at preſent the adverſary ſeems to prevail, even to a bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down and bringing under of that great intereſt of our bleſſed Maſter. But it is as ſure there is no ground to fear this (being well underſtood) which is a moſt <hi>hopeful</hi> and <hi>promiſing ſign</hi> to the Church: for we muſt thus reaſon from the Scripture; <hi>if Chriſt muſt reign until all his enemies be brought in ſubjection,</hi> it is then ſure, the greater the oppoſition and aſſault be, the victory muſt be the greater. And if that be not only prayed for, but a clear prophecy, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt will take unto himſelf his great Power, and reign,</hi> muſt we not <hi>then</hi> expect he will take it, yea, in a more eminent and conſpicuous manner, when men are ſeeking, in the height of their rebellion and <hi>rage againſt the Lord and his anointed,</hi> to ſeize on his Scepter, and ſnatch it from him? And if this alſo be ſure, and in the volumn of that record of the Scripture written concerning him, <hi>that his Crown muſt flouriſh on his own Head,</hi> ſhall not then <hi>his enemies be cloathed with ſhame?</hi> Yea, hath not this truth a dreadful aſpect on the crowns and Scepters of many princes, who would rob the mediator of his?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not a ſtrange <hi>preſage</hi> and <hi>ſign</hi> of the time, <hi>that we now ſee moſt hopeful</hi> and <hi>promiſing appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> for the Church's good, remarkably blaſted; things, which in an ordinary way look to be grounds of encouragement, made to fail? We ſee <hi>human props</hi> almoſt every where removed, or broken; the truth deſerted by great men; yea, the families of ſuch fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off this day from the Lord, whoſe anceſtors for a long time had been zealous for his intereſt. I confeſs, this is a threatning appearance, by which
<pb n="498" facs="unknown:005185_0533_1016DEDF4F26A598"/>
many now ſeem to be ſhaken: but I would humbly reaſon on Scripture-grounds, that it is <hi>no bad ſign,</hi> but hath therewith ſome comfortable aſpect on the Church; it being clear, (1.) That ſuch a <hi>connection</hi> is no ſtrange thing in the bible, betwixt an <hi>extream exigence</hi> of the Church's caſe, and the Lord's <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent appearing</hi> for her relief. See <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30. 18. &amp; 63. 5. Iſa. 51. 20, 21, 22. Yea, I muſt ſay, it is hard to find any great mercy and remarkable deliverance of the Church, but hath at ſome ſuch backſet ſurprized her. (2.) Is not ſuch a diſadvantage &amp; forſaken caſe expreſly held forth as one of <hi>grace's opportunities of doing good to his people?</hi> Read <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you will ſee it; that when <hi>none</hi> is to <hi>plead her cauſe, no healer,</hi> and <hi>Zion</hi> called an <hi>outcaſt,</hi> which <hi>no man ſeeketh after;</hi> thence does the Lord allow his people to be incouraged, &amp; to take it as a ground of hope, that he will by his own immediate hand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. (3.) Is it not from the word clear, that a <hi>people</hi> at ſuch a <hi>diſadvantage,</hi> &amp; under moſt viſible <hi>weakneſs</hi> when in God's way, may be <hi>then</hi> made uſe of for <hi>greateſt ſervice?</hi> They were in as ſore diſtreſs, of whom (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 34.) it is written, <hi>Out of weakneſs they were made ſtrong,</hi> &amp;c.—I ſhall further add; Can there be cauſe, from the withdrawing of humane help and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means of ſafety, to fear the Church's ruin, when it falls under his hand, who by things moſt deſtructive can ſerve his intereſt, and bring ſalvation at ſuch a time, when none but God could ſave! And why are thoſe wonderful providences, that have ſo oft met the Church in a forſaken caſe, written before us in the Scripture? Is it not for <hi>after-times,</hi> to witneſs to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, how the Church may be <hi>caſt down, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;</hi> and though ſhe fall, ſhe cannot lie ſtill, but muſt ariſe? <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. Nor have her adverſaries any cauſe of triumph thence, <hi>Micah</hi> 7. 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the preſent appearance of the time, is not
<pb n="499" facs="unknown:005185_0534_1016DF22BA571AB8"/>
this a <hi>threatning ſign,</hi> which hath a very dreadful aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect on the Church, even <hi>that diſcernable loſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage the beſt now ſeem to be at in their frame,</hi> and that under a <hi>growing trial</hi> of the Church; &amp; the <hi>great diſtemper</hi> many of theſe appear to be in, whilſt we may ſee much of that holy fear and tenderneſs, that did formerly ſhew it ſelf amongſt the godly, gone; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aloft; prejudice eaſily taken; a Spirit of jealouſy poured out; yea, very ſtrange and unuſual out-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in offence and ſcandal. And oh! is there not here cauſe of fear, that the righteous God be on a further departure from his people, and that his judgment ſhall yet more hotly purſue ſuch, until he have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed this generation? On which account if he ſhould make us <hi>a generation of his wrath,</hi> we are called to adore and juſtify the unſpotted way of the Lord. Yet even as to this, I muſt adventure with reſpect to ſovereignty of <hi>grace</hi> (which is only like itſelf, and infinitely above our thoughts) to offer ſome diſcovery, from the Scripture, of what he hath done in like caſes. How marvellouſly hath the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and long ſuffering God interpoſed, and at ſuch a ſore extremity helped his Church? For it is clear, (1) That when the Church hath had no argument to make uſe of, no confidence to plead, but broken and confounded under the ſenſe of horrid guilt, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ds one in himſelf, Iſai. 48. 9. <hi>For my name's ſake will I defer my anger,</hi> &amp;c.—(2.) We find the Covenant made uſe of by the Lord, to fiſt a judicial proceedure againſt his people. Pſalm 106. 44. <hi>Nevertheleſs he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry; and remembred for them his covenant.</hi>—(3) We find the rage and violence of the adverſary, and their taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to blaſpheme, made uſe of as an argument by him to own his people, who had otherwiſe for-fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the former grounds of confidence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 26.—(4.) We may read how ſovereign Grace
<pb n="500" facs="unknown:005185_0535_1016B89ED8B56C98"/>
hath thus marvellouſly ſtepped in, when the rod did not humble, and ſmiting would not do the turn. <hi>I ſmote them, and they went on frowardly in the way of their heart, Iſai.</hi> 57. 17. Yet, ſays the Lord, I will not thus quit them, there is one cure for all, <hi>I have ſeen their ways, and will heal them.</hi> Such a diſcovery alſo have we thereof, when a people's ruin is of themſelves, and iniquity hath brought them low. <hi>Hos.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf; but in me is thy help.</hi> Yea, hath not grace reſcued thoſe on whom their mercy muſt be forced, and while on a hot chaſe in departing from God! <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 7, 9.—(5.) Have we not this choice diſcovery of the Lord's way with his people held forth in the Scripture, that whilſt he works all their works for them, <hi>He will work theſe in them alſo, Iſai.</hi> 26. 12. I ſhall add, thus hath the freedom of grace (O marvellous grace!) ſhined forth in former ages of the Church. But they ſadly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take its meaning, who are thus made ſecure, and not thereby led unto repentance.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This looks like one of the <hi>ſigns</hi> of our time, that there is a great ceaſing <hi>of the godly,</hi> yea the choice thereof, even by a more than uſual <hi>diſpatch:</hi> &amp; is not this a ſad Scripture-preſage of evil coming, when ſuch are (as it were) haſtned away, that they may be <hi>hid</hi> in the grave, from a further ſtorm? Yet theſe things ſeem clear alſo, (1.) What a remarkable conſumption did almoſt wear out the Church in the wilderneſs, whilſt even then there was a haſtening of her after-enlargement; and though a ſore judgment yet the Church's mercy, in a greater repair of that loſs, was helped forward; yea, we find <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> with many of thoſe who had been moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent inſtruments in <hi>Iſrael'</hi>s coming forth out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> taken away on a near approach of their entrie into <hi>Canaan.</hi>—(2.) It is ſure, ſome of the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Scripture, waits on the Church, when
<pb n="503" facs="unknown:005185_0536_1016DF244B5D7C20"/>
brought to a very ſmall remnant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6. 8, 9. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 37. 31.—(3.) Hath not the Lord ſaid in ſuch a caſe, <hi>The conſumption determined ſhall overflow with righteouſneſs? Iſai.</hi> 10. 20. That the next tide can bring in as many, with a marvellous increaſe, as theſe former conſuming ſtrokes had taken away; yea is it not ſeen, with a wearing out of the godly, and a declining of religion, in one part of the World, or of a country, where many have been called, that it doth break out remarkably in an other? And thus the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel recovers that intereſt, which it ſeemed to have loſt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Does not the <hi>preſent appearance</hi> of the time, <hi>threaten,</hi> by very unuſual ſigns and preſages, ſome <hi>ſharp ſtorm</hi> to come now upon the World? which in many inſtances we may diſcern, that there is ſome remarkable work of <hi>judgment</hi> to be brought forth, and a great break amongſt the nations near. (Though <hi>the earth</hi> ſeems this day in a ſtrange meaſure <hi>quiet,</hi> yea ſo extraordinary a <hi>calm</hi> as is now through the World, may it not be a preſage of ſome great <hi>ſtorm,</hi> which as too clear and hot a ſunſhine foretels a break of the weather.) Sure it is, there is a <hi>ſound of great wrath</hi> and judgment, in the ears of many, who know what is to <hi>diſcern the times.</hi> It is well, the <hi>Scripture</hi> is near; a prognoſtication that can anſwer all the ages of the Church: and it is <hi>there</hi> we ſhould enquire, what ſuch a <hi>ſign</hi> does portend? We may not <hi>wiſh the evil day;</hi> but on ſuch an appearance of the time, that awful impreſſion (<hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 16.) is called for, to be in a <hi>trembling</hi> frame, when God threatens and does thus <hi>utter his voice:</hi> yet is it clear, that from theſe threatning ſigns there is a comfortable ſound of <hi>much good to the Church.</hi> For, (1.) We find <hi>days of vengeance</hi> on the <hi>World,</hi> held forth as neceſſary for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of the Scripture, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 22. and made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the bringing forth ſome ſpecial truth
<pb n="502" facs="unknown:005185_0537_1016DEE36F7A6758"/>
thereof unto a performance.—2. We find in times of greateſt judgment, the <hi>Church'</hi>s intereſt then ſet apart and <hi>ſecured,</hi> with a large warrant to the godly, not to fear; even whilſt <hi>his garments are dyed with blood. Iſa.</hi> 63. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10.—(3) May we not ſee alſo the Church's <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment,</hi> and ſome of her greateſt mercies, thus uſhered in? which is clear, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 4. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 8. And O what a ſtrange connexion is there? That the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the earth in a flame, and overturning the nations, when the Lord, as a lion does rouſe himſelf up to the prey, ſhould be the very riſe to an accompliſhing of ſome great promiſes for the Church's advantage, yea, and as a preludum to the ſame! Yet nothing more evident to ſuch who underſtand the Scripture; and by ſuch a <hi>ſign</hi> does the Lord ſpeak comfortably to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. We find a dreadful <hi>Winter-ſtorm</hi> on the World, pointed out as a <hi>ſpring-time</hi> to the Church, and the trees <hi>putting forth their bloſſom,</hi> as <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 25. It is clear, her deliverance may be begun, and the ſtorm then breaking, which may for a time put the Church under greater difficulties than before; yea, cauſe the godly to miſtake, and tremble at the ſight of their mercy, becauſe of thoſe things by which it is uſhered in, even when it is before their eyes. I ſhall add no more but this, It is our great concernment, to <hi>fear him</hi> who guides all things, to whom alone the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of events doth belong; and this is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his people, <hi>not to faint</hi> at the ſtrange appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the time or the ſigns thereof, but to <hi>know what is called for,</hi> and thence read perſonal duties, from the ſad preſages of publick judgments, and to purſue more nearneſs with God, and enſure a retreat under his ſhadow until the indignation paſs over. <hi>For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to viſit the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth, and the earth ſhall diſcloſe her blood, and no more cover her ſlain. Iſai,</hi> 26. 21.</p>

               <hi>A third particular,</hi> which concerns the godly with much circumſpection to notice and underſtand, in their <hi>diſcerning the time,</hi> is <hi>the peculiar ſnares and hazards thereof.</hi> This is the Scripture character of the <hi>wiſe</hi> man, to <hi>diſcern time and judgment,</hi> it being ſo oft verified (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 12.) that <hi>in an evil time the children of men are enſnared, when it falls ſuddenly upon them.</hi> Sure it is, there are ſearching times, when the Chriſtian's way is more difficult and narrow (though each day hath its ſnares, which in a ſpecial way waits thereon) and then is it <hi>the wiſdom of the prudent, to underſtand his way,</hi> and know his ground, which the adverſary by ſubtil and indiſcernable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches will ſeek to draw him off; then is a quick ſagacious diſcerning in the fear of the Lord called for, to have their eyes in their head, and be in a watching poſture, when the net is cloſely ſpread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feet. It is a ſad remark, too clearly verified oft times on a people profeſſing the truth, which is ſaid of <hi>Ephraim, Strangers have devoured their ſtrength, and they knew it not;</hi> Yea, their not diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame proves a ſpecial cauſe of their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ruin. And is it not written for the ages to come, in what a ſecure and ſleeping poſture <hi>Sampſon</hi> had his hair cut! He firſt loſt his diſcerning of ſuch a ſnare, ere he loſt his eyes. We find <hi>David</hi> (through many of the Pſalms) in his wreſtlings with God, more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for the preventing the <hi>ſnares</hi> of wicked men, and a delivery thence, than from their <hi>rage</hi> and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. There is a feeling the pulſe of the times, by which the preſent diſtemper and hazard of the Church may be known, as well as of the body of man: and I muſt ſay, this day in a ſpecial manner calls us to this grave ſtudy. I intend no further application, but a very ſhort touch at ſome things in general, which rightly purſued in the godly man's ſerious ſtudy, may help to diſcern ſomething of the publick ſnares of the
<pb n="504" facs="unknown:005185_0539_1016DEE612F20578"/>
time, and how they get advantage in their approach, for theſe cloſely wait their ſeaſon, <hi>for in vain is the net ſpread in the ſight of the bird.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is clear, <hi>each time hath its peculiar diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper</hi> and <hi>evils,</hi> that have then a ſpecial power and prevalency therewith, the <hi>obſerving</hi> of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the godly, for their more watchful adverting to the <hi>ſnares of that time.</hi> For then the temptation of the time goes therewith, as the preſent diſtemper diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers itſelf, whither in a hot boiling feaver, or in a dead lethargy; and follows thoſe evils, which are in that time moſt contagious, where the current of the multitude runs, which is giving the godly the greateſt aſſault, and ſeem to be warmed under the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable aſpect and countenance of great men: yea, thoſe evils, which promiſe ſome outward advantage and ſecurity from trouble, when the queſtion is ſtated betwixt ſin and ſuffering, it is there the preſent ſnare does haunt, and there lies a ſpecial piece of the godly man's work, to hold off and keep a diſtance from the leaſt acceſſion thereto; yea, I may ſay next to the ſalvation of their ſoul, to be ſolicitous all along their way, to have their garments keeped from the ſmalleſt ſtain and ſpot thereof. A touch, a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement from a <hi>publick</hi> prevailing evil, being found to draw more deep on the conſcience, and with more difficulty do men recover and eſcape thence, than from many other <hi>perſonal</hi> infirmities.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is alſo clear, there is ſome piece of the <hi>truth of God,</hi> in each time of the Church, that is more <hi>queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned</hi> and brought in <hi>debate,</hi> by which with greater advantage and clearneſs we may know where a <hi>publick ſnare</hi> doth lie. For here is its aim directed, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle and aſſault the godly man, where in a ſpecial way he is called to his poſt, to contend for ſuch an intereſt: and thus it may be ſaid, if one keep ſight
<pb n="505" facs="unknown:005185_0540_1016DF2B8A730898"/>
well of preſent duty, he will with more facility find out the ſcent, on which the ſnare of the time is, how it directs its motion to darken or caſt an obſtruction in the way of that duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may thus diſcern a <hi>prevailing ſnare,</hi> and its getting ground, by that tendency there is in a day of trial, to <hi>queſtion</hi> and make new inquiry about <hi>duties</hi> which were <hi>once clear</hi> and <hi>unqueſtionable,</hi> when their <hi>judgment was not byaſſed</hi> from any outward incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For this ſpeaks men's finding a ſad invention to be rid of their <hi>conſcience,</hi> by <hi>extenuating</hi> preſent controverſies: a deſign, which (in the righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord) is ſeldom ſet on foot by any, but they too viſibly thrive therein, for their further ruin, and get an anſwer according to the idol of their heart. Thus <hi>Balaam,</hi> we have in divine record as a dreadful inſtance, who tried that way, and therein was ſucceſsful. And is it not a known remark, that a heſitation and <hi>faint upon the heart,</hi> from want of reſolution to ſuffer for the truth, will not long want a <hi>ſcruple in the head,</hi> to cauſe a debate thereabout; and then is it eaſy for a ſnare to enter. O with what fear and tenderneſs ſhould light be guarded; which, as the apple of the eye, may by the leaſt thing be hurt, but is not eaſily healed! Thus is it, men do inſenſibly wear out from under thoſe former Impreſſions they had upon them of duty; and ere they are aware have their judgment by a judicial ſtroke determined in that, which was before their deſire. They know little that <hi>depth of a man's heart,</hi> who are not jealous over a change on their judgment in an hour of trial, when its tendency is, to <hi>ſpare themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We may diſcern a <hi>publick ſnare</hi> in it's approach, by that <hi>advantage the adverſary gets</hi> thereby to <hi>divide the godly,</hi> and thoſe who appear <hi>for</hi> the truth, <hi>amongſt themſelves.</hi> For then it is eaſy to enter by ſuch a breach, and throw in the bait in ſo muddy a
<pb n="506" facs="unknown:005185_0541_1016DEE9C33E5280"/>
water: it being too obvious, what an advantage a ſnare hath, where jealouſy, with theſe bitter effects of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſtrife and quarreling, turns mens eyes off the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hazard, and blunts that edge of contending for the truth, in ſmiting one an other. I do not mean but there may be a neceſſity oft on the godly, to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> their friends <hi>to their face,</hi> yea, the eminenteſt in the Church, were it a <hi>Peter,</hi> (Gal. 2. 11.) when the truth is concerned; but this ſhould be with greateſt caution and tenderneſs, to obviate a breach, or quarrel which is <hi>like the breaking in of waters,</hi> whilſt the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>adverſary</hi> waits his advantage in ſuch a day of their halting. And it is too ſadly known, how ſmall a wedg, that is driven with a tendency to that end, makes way for the entry of a further ſnare; ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. what a ſad connexion there is betwixt a dividing time of the Church, and a further departing from the truth. But we muſt always take heed, that we ſo purſue uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt our ſelves, as that Chriſt and his cauſe be not left alone.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A <hi>preſent ſnare</hi> may be ſeen by the <hi>ſudden change of known adverſaries,</hi> and the <hi>friendly inſinuations</hi> of thoſe who were wont to <hi>threaten.</hi> That in ſuch an appearance there lies an ambuſh, and is but a change of weapons for a ſeen advantage, ſure this ſhould be ground of fear, and a cautious advertence to be much alone with God, that men may <hi>know the voice of the ſhepherd,</hi> leſt they <hi>follow after</hi> a <hi>ſtranger;</hi> it being more uſual, to be ſtolen off their feet in a calm, than blown down by a ſtorm; it is hard to ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blandiſhments of men, where that more endearing and ſweet reliſh of peace with God is not kept on the ſoul, which is a choice mean to make the ear deaf to the moſt charming voice of the enchanter: oft hath it been ſeen, that <hi>adder's poiſon is under their lips,</hi> whilſt wrath is boiling in their heart (<hi>Pſal</hi> 140) yea, that the cruel man can change his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="507" facs="unknown:005185_0542_1016DF2D16138510"/>
when it is fit to lay a ſnare, and with <hi>Joah</hi> embrace them in their arms, whom they intend to <hi>ſmite under the fifth rib.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. May not thus a <hi>ſnare</hi> be ſeen in its <hi>approach,</hi> by that prevalence the <hi>fear of man</hi> hath over the time, and that unuſual command it ſeems to have ſome times over the ſpirits of men, even thoſe whoſe <hi>former zeal</hi> and <hi>reſolution for the truth</hi> hath in other trials with much advantage appeared? Here is indeed cauſe to watch; for <hi>in the fear of man there is a ſnare (Prov.</hi> 29. 25.) which then will take advantage to purſue, when it finds men in a flying poſture, and ſhrunk ſo far below their former appearance. We find the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man hath his <hi>breſt-plate:</hi> but he hath no piece of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for his <hi>back,</hi> when he turns his fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. It's ſad, when the adverſary is taught to follow, by our fainting: and <hi>that ſpirit which is in the World,</hi> ſeems to be upon the aſcendent, with a prevalence even over the ſpirits of the <hi>godly;</hi> yea, thoſe debaſed and made contemptible in their eyes, in whom the appearance of God and his authority upon them at another time would have made the hearts of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to tremble. This is too obvious, in a humbling and judicial time of the Church, until once that hour of her trial go over.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A <hi>publick ſnare</hi> is then to be <hi>feared,</hi> and calls for a watching eye, by that <hi>ſucceſs</hi> which waits on a <hi>ſinful courſe;</hi> eſpecially when ſuch a ſhine is of any <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> For then <hi>new queries</hi> will be ſtarted, <hi>ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi> ſpread, with much ſubtil reflexion on <hi>the way of the Lord,</hi> to make the godly queſtion the ſame. <hi>The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> found it not eaſy to ſtand before this, which put him to bring under debate his principles, and the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his cauſe <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73. 13. And in ſuch a trial doth the <hi>adverſary,</hi> by ſome continued obſervation, know how to aſſault the followers of the truth, and attack them at their weakeſt: then is it the <hi>ſcandal of the
<pb n="508" facs="unknown:005185_0543_1016DEEB4DC24720"/>
croſs</hi> cauſeth many to offend; then it is ſore for ſuch to ſuffer, who <hi>know not the fellowſhip of the croſs of Chriſt,</hi> which is a piece of the greateſt and moſt near fellowſhip with him upon the earth: Yea, then the Church may run more hazard from ſome of her <hi>friends,</hi> then from the profeſſed adverſary. For thus oft is a prevailing ſnare helped forward: it cannot but be a ſearching and hazardous time, when many are turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide, and ſome of underſtanding ſuffered to fall, who are ready to preſs <hi>their ſin,</hi> as duty, <hi>on others;</hi> for ſeldom do ſuch fall off, but are found more ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and active in ſuch a way to ingage others, than they were while holding their former integrity to purſue the truth's intereſt: <hi>thus we have ſeen it, ſo it is, let us hear it and know it for our good</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Thus a <hi>ſnare of the time</hi> may be diſcerned, by the <hi>tendency thereof to corruption in the Church,</hi> and a producing ſtill the ſame effects, what ever be pretended, when by the hands of <hi>Eſau,</hi> it diſcovers itſelf, though it have the voice of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And doth not the ruin of many, who have daſhed on ſuch a rock, and have been thus taken, put a ſad mark thereon? For it may be ſaid, no ſnare or ſubtil contrivance of the adverſary awaits the godly in the preſent time, but if men do not conſent to ſhut their eyes, they may from the Scripture and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Church, ſee at others coſt ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable beacon ſet thereon; what a ſad tendency ſuch a thing hath ſtill had, to a <hi>making ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience;</hi> how hard it is to dance about the fire and not be burned, or ſtand in the way and counſels of ungodly men and not be enſnared.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It ſeems to threaten a ſnare, when <hi>enquiry</hi> about the <hi>duty of the time</hi> is purſued without reſpect to the <hi>preſent caſe</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> thereof. For thus a ſnare may wait in a thing at <hi>other times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> the neglect whereof under ſome ſpecial cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="509" facs="unknown:005185_0544_1016DF2FA25C72A0"/>
may be a quitting their duty; and the doing alſo, or yielding to ſomething <hi>in another caſe warrantable,</hi> at ſometimes may fall under a moral prohibition. As this, when a thing in its ſelf indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <hi>Circa ſacra et cultum Dei,</hi> is preſſed by the Magiſtrate, as neceſſary by vertue of his ſole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and to the ſubjecting the godly in things wherein they are not ſubject and to the prejudice of an other juriſdiction; can there be an enquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this in the <hi>general,</hi> without a <hi>particular</hi> applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>complex caſe?</hi> It may be ſaid a <hi>ſnare</hi> is then on the entry, when that conſideration of the Prophet is not much regarded in the preſent queſtion, <hi>Is this a time for ſuch a thing?</hi> For the diſciples to refreſh themſelves with <hi>ſleep,</hi> was a piece of innocent duty; but that they could not <hi>watch this one hour with their Maſter</hi> in his ſufferings, muſt needs vary the caſe; for it was in ſo far a deſerting him.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I ſhall further add, is not this a ſad appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſome <hi>publick ſnare</hi> getting advantage, which is witneſſed by a <hi>previous diſpoſition,</hi> and that preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence <hi>private ingagements</hi> to an <hi>outward intereſt</hi> hath upon men's ſpirits? For a ſnare enters not without a call, and finds within, its greateſt ſtrength and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yea a <hi>conformity to the World,</hi> with an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible wearing out of ſoul-tenderneſs, is too oft known to have a tendency for conforming to an evil courſe. For the motion is then down the hill; and there is cauſe to fear, the ſnare will follow in there, and lie about that intereſt, which otherwiſe hath got the maſtery over them. How many in embracing the World, have at the next ſtep fallen off from the truth? No weapon hath been more made uſe of againſt the Church, and hath ruined more: ſo that it may be ſaid, where other ſnares have killed their <hi>thouſands,</hi> this its <hi>ten thouſands.</hi> I muſt ſay, ſuch an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a time of the Church's trial is like the
<pb n="510" facs="unknown:005185_0545_1016DEEF1F3AF308"/>
breaking forth of her gray hairs; nor is it eaſy for thoſe to ſtand, or reſiſt, who are ſo far gone back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or keep their feet before a ſnare, where the truth ceaſeth to get a command over their heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A fourth particular,</hi> which calls for a ſerious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, from thoſe who <hi>know the time,</hi> and are wiſe to diſcern the ſame, is this, <hi>What can the righteous do?</hi> when there is a <hi>growing darkneſs</hi> on the Church, and the very <hi>foundation</hi> like to be ſhaken; yea, the hearts of many ſo far down, that they are like to loſe their <hi>hand</hi> therewith, in the matter of duty, and give over, as men aſtoniſhed, <hi>ſeeing this evil is from the Lord.</hi> It is no ſmall thing, to manage well ſuch a time of the Church's trial, and in ſo ſharp a ſtorm there is need of much balaſt: but we know, the Scripture of God is near, which ſtands good for his people's conduct, to let them know how to ſteer their courſe in the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt night, and from that bleſſed record there is one thing clearly held forth to anſwer ſuch a time, which is a great duty; <hi>Let the righteous hold on his way, and he who hath clean hands wax ſtronger, and ſtronger, Job</hi> 17. 9. For it is ſure, they have cauſe and ſolid ground for this, though the earth ſhould in a more ſtrange manner reel, and the pillars thereof ſeem to be diſſolved: ſince it is certain and true,—</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That all is well,</hi> and nothing can fall wrong, whilſt <hi>the foundation of God,</hi> which is his eternal counſel held forth in the Scripture, abides <hi>ſure.</hi> Tho' other foundations be ſhaken, the godly man does then ly at a ſafe anchor, which will not drive in a ſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my day: his great intereſt is beyond hazard, though more than an immortal ſoul were in that adventure: his heaven is ſure, whereof he cannot be beguiled, whilſt things upon the earth ſeem moſt uncertain: and muſt it not then be <hi>well</hi> with the Church, were it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="511" facs="unknown:005185_0546_1016DF32A04F83D0"/>
ſinking in to the grave, ſince the Mediator will bring it up again? Men's evil eye cannot hurt, nor their curſing blaſt that intereſt, which God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For it is then ſure, <hi>there is no enchantment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>nor divination againſt</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Is not the <hi>truth,</hi> and the great intereſt of <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> that <hi>to a Chriſtian,</hi> &amp; in ſuch a manner <hi>known</hi> to him, that it <hi>needs no teſtimony from men,</hi> or incitement from <hi>example</hi> of others? For to theſe it commends itſelf, and does witneſs its reality, though by all the generation amongſt whom they live, it ſhould be cried down. It's ſure, to be a Chriſtian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, requires this, to <hi>know the truth,</hi> and be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch a ground, that can ſupport and quiet the ſoul in the greateſt falling off of others, though none elſe were to walk in that way; that if it were ſuppoſed, <hi>one</hi> ſerious Chriſtian in ſuch an age were in the whole World, and thus <hi>left alone,</hi> there is ſo great a diſcovery and certainly of the truth to be known upon the ſoul, as ſhould oblige him to ſuch a declaration with <hi>Joſhua, But as for me I will ſerve the Lord.</hi> O to ſee a generation of men of ſuch mettal, who with reſolute peremptorineſs would <hi>forſake all men,</hi> and <hi>follow the Lord,</hi> and ſerve him without company, if better might not be; we might by the hand of ſuch expect to be led through <hi>Jordan,</hi> after our <hi>Moſes'</hi>s are dead, by whom we were led thorow the <hi>red-ſea:</hi> but alas, where are they!</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Have not thoſe ground in the <hi>darkeſt</hi> time to be <hi>confirmed,</hi> who may ſee cauſe to <hi>improve the moſt ſhaking things,</hi> which fall out in their day, for their <hi>further eſtabliſhment;</hi> and ſtrengthen their hand in the way of the Lord, by thoſe diſpenſations at which many ſtumble? It is ſtrange, to obſerve what a chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge and upcaſt ſome have in their reflecting on the truth, on thoſe grounds which in their conſcience
<pb n="512" facs="unknown:005185_0547_1016DEF0ADCE68F0"/>
they muſt admit to be a convincing witneſs thereto. But having at ſome length elſewhere touched this, I ſhall but add theſe few things more, which as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>grounds of eſtabliſhment in the way of the Lord,</hi> and for our further ſtrengthning therein, ſhould be improved, which yet are an uſual challenge by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>number</hi> ſeems ſo <hi>ſmall,</hi> who follow the <hi>truth,</hi> and are found <hi>ſerious</hi> in the ſtudy of <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> can be no ground to queſtion this, without a ſtrange miſtake; ſince men muſt either quit the Scripture, or admit, <hi>the way to life is ſtrait, and few enter therein:</hi> Yea, that the ſmall convoy the truth hath in the World is an expreſs verification of it. Is there the leaſt warrant, to make the ſuffrage of the multitude a teſt of the way of the Lord? But it is ſure, we can ſhew them the contrary, that his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers are a ſelect number, choſen out of the World, the great bulk whereof is outlawed, and put out of the interceſſion of the Mediator; elſe the Scripture could not be fulfilled. And is not the falling of many from the truth a great ſeal thereto, no leſs than the incoming of others? and that excellent way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the more diſcernably known by ſuch a character, that it is <hi>every where ſpoken againſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That ſo great <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> does this day attend the truth and practice of Godlineſs, ſhould prejudice none thereat: but be a further ground of ſtrengthening, to help the Chriſtian to hold on his way; ſince it is nothing elſe but what is foretold, and what the moſt excellent of the earth in their time have met with, to be <hi>accounted the filth and off ſcouring of the World.</hi> In no age hath the truth wanted ſuch an aſſault, and in no age hath it wanted a triumph over the ſame: Yea, hath not the greateſt reproacher ſometime been forced to give in his retractation, and

When God comes near by a ſtroke of his judgment, then do the proud change their ſtile; and ſpeak in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other language, upon the awful appearance of death. But this alſo doth witneſs, what a marvellous thing Religion is, which with thoſe who know it, loſeth no weight, when under the greateſt cloud of detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contempt: For then is <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtill <hi>precious,</hi> and his way deſireable, <hi>unto thoſe who believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>ſentence is not ſpeedily executed againſt an evil courſe,</hi> we ſee what improvement the World makes thereof, to be more deſperately wicked: but is not this alſo a <hi>ſeal</hi> and <hi>confirmation of the truth?</hi> and a ground for <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> in the way of the Lord, which verifies the Scripture, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 11. And it is there men may ſee, a ſhort repreival from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is no pardon, or acquittance, whilſt ſin runs on to an after-account; that judgment deferred, when therewith a further hardening appears, doth threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten more, than a quick and preſent diſpatch; &amp; ſhews, the ſtroke will be the greater, when it comes. Surely if this fell not out, whereof the World takes ſuch advantage, it might in ſo far put us to queſtion the truth, of which one ſyllable muſt not fall to the ground.</p>
            <p n="4">4. So great an <hi>abounding of prophanity</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs within the Church,</hi> is it not an undeniable ſeal to the verity of the Scriptures which thus takes place, and ſhould help the godly man to hold on his way; it being unanſwerably clear, there could be no darkneſs, if there were not ſuch a thing as light; or folly, if there were no wiſdom: and is not excellent <hi>holineſs</hi> thus evidently made known in its oppoſite, to which there could be no contrariety, if it ſelf were not moſt real.</p>

ceaſing purſued by error, and the aſſault of thoſe adverſaries, who in every age are ſeeking to darken the ſame, can be no ground of prejudice and ſhaking, without a ſtrange miſtake: but ſhould ſtrengthen the godly in their way, and help them to wax ſtronger, who have the Scripture thus ſo expreſly fulfilled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their eyes. It is ſure, the Lord hath <hi>made his way plain,</hi> nor does that bleſſed record give any ground to <hi>turn aſide unto crooked paths:</hi> for thoſe are clouds of men's own creating, which have ſuch a tendency to darken the ſame. But we ſee truth in all ages wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by error, which (with any brighter diſcovery thereof) breaks out like a thick fog; though theſe can never unite, no more than gold and clay can join together: and it is clear, the notion of error were unconceivable, if the truth had not a certainty and real being; nor doth it conflict with ſuch an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but for its further triumph. Oh if the ſolid <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> were in earneſt purſued, and men's ſouls once brought under the power and authority of the truth, as that which is the word and teſtimony of the <hi>living God,</hi> it would prove a more effectual cure to ſo dreadful a diſtemper of the Church, than all the diſputes of the time; which are of ſpecial <hi>uſe</hi> alſo. May not <hi>Atheiſm</hi> be found, upon a ſerious inquiry, the great riſe of error, and of men's bold adventuring to make the Scripture of God a ſport of their invention, to make it ſubſervient to their intereſt, and run after ſuch a byaſs? And ſhould it not be for a lamentation, that a humble ſerious <hi>inquiry</hi> after the <hi>truth,</hi> under an awful impreſſion of that GOD whoſe word it is, is this day ſo <hi>rare</hi> a thing in the World?</p>
            <p>Now this being ſo ſharp <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> trial of the Church, and one of thoſe things whereat many pretend to be moſt ſhaken, though I have in an other part touched it a little, I would add further ſome few remarks,
<pb n="515" facs="unknown:005185_0550_1016DF39658E6CF8"/>
how clear and expreſs a confirmation of the word even this is, which ſhould more fix and eſtabliſh thoſe who love the truth. (1.) It is manifeſt, that no error or corrupt doctrine aſſaults the Church, but is in ſuch a manner pointed forth, yea, by ſo expreſs an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition thereto, in the Scripture, that we may ſee a <hi>prophetical forewarning</hi> thereof, and of men's endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to corrupt &amp; darken ſuch a piece of the truth. It is ſure, the word is written and in a ſpecial way direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to every time of the Church, and to all her after-trials and aſſaults is peculiarly ſuited, by him who knew &amp; did foreſee what oppoſition his truth in after-ages ſhould meet with: and in this marvellous record men may clearly ſee (if there were ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious inquiry) that there is no poiſon or corruption in doctrine, which infeſts the Church, but hath its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per antidote there provided. I muſt here as to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance ſay, if I were not perſwaded of a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined ſpecies of government for the Church</hi> under the new Teſtament (which is clear in the Scripture holding forth its conſtitution to be <hi>Ariſtocratick,</hi> with a parity amongſt the officers of Jeſus Chriſt in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of their power, and a ſubordination of the leſſer parts to the greater) I could not ſhun ſo clear a remark, of that expreſs <hi>prohibition</hi> of any <hi>diſparity</hi> and <hi>Lordly prelacy</hi> in his houſe; yea, how manifeſtly the allſeeing God, when he was about to found the Chriſtian Church, doth point in ſuch plain terms at this, that we may there read a very direct prediction of that ruin and prejudice, it would on this account ſuſtain in after-times. I ſpeak this on no particular intereſt, or from bitterneſs and prejudice at the perſons of any, but have confidence to ſay, it is from the awe and perſwaſion of the truth. Sure, on politick grounds and with reſpect to an outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, it is eaſy to judge, that way wants not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading bait; if ſomething greater were not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate,
<pb n="516" facs="unknown:005185_0551_1016DF3D426ECD80"/>
and a deſtroying hook did not wait there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which ſhould make the purchaſe too dear, at the rate of <hi>denying Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in a piece of his truth, when a <hi>confeſſion</hi> thereof is called for <hi>before men.</hi>—(2.) Do we not ſee even in thoſe things, which in that marvellous <hi>depth of error and deluſion</hi> on men's ſouls ſeem moſt ſtrange, the Scripture thence moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly comfirmed, and in that <hi>power</hi> and <hi>energy</hi> which attends it, and is to many matter of aſtoniſhment, may diſcern how theſe <hi>clouds are carried about with a tempeſt</hi> (2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 17.) and driven on by a judicial ſtroke. And though it is amazing to ſee at what a rate many are this way turned mad, with a diſcernable bewitching of their judgment, and a beſotting into moſt ſtrange and abſurd extravagancies; yea, how tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and violent in their way, when ſilenced with the cleareſt diſcoveries of the truth: yet is not this alſo witneſſed, <hi>there is a righteous God giving up to ſtrong deluſion,</hi> in which <hi>Satan is let looſe</hi> with a remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power to <hi>deceive.</hi> 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 12. O how dreadful is that ſtroke which is inflicted on the judgment and reaſon, which in ſome reſpect we may ſay is greater than that which is on the affections!—(3.) Find we not the Scripture by a clear prophetical diſcovery points at that influence <hi>humane authority,</hi> and the patrociny of ſuch, who have a name and repute in the Church, ſhould have on the <hi>corrupting the doctrine</hi> thereof? And therefore does the Holy Ghoſt ſo particularly guard againſt the ſame, and oppoſe the authority of the <hi>written word</hi> to the higheſt pretences of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that here an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> muſt not be admitted, or have credit, to the truth's prejudice; not an <hi>Angel,</hi> yea, not <hi>a voice from heaven,</hi> may oppoſe it ſelf to this <hi>more ſure teſtimony</hi> of God in his word.—(4.) Is it not here even in that great depth of error we ſee this truth take place, <hi>deceiving and being deceived;</hi> how ſtrangely theſe meet, and by a marvellous
<pb n="517" facs="unknown:005185_0552_1016DF3FDE1B69A8"/>
ſtroke men's <hi>judgment</hi> made captive to their <hi>will,</hi> and their deliberate acting to <hi>deceive others</hi> have the ſame effect on <hi>themſelves.</hi>—(5.) Thus alſo is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture made out, where we ſee how <hi>hard</hi> it is for men to <hi>fix,</hi> in ſuch a way; or find land, when they are once carried off the truth, and do lanch out in that horrid gulf of error: but <hi>ſeducers wax worſe and worſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inference.</hi> V. <hi>The truth of God revealed in the Scripture is in its import not more marvellous and great, than we may ſay is clear and obvious in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of its verification:</hi> which hath every where ſuch a witneſs, that there can be no eſcape from this diſcovery; but if men will <hi>not receive</hi> its teſtimony, they muſt have it <hi>forced</hi> on them as their <hi>torment.</hi> For it is here invention doth fail, and politicks are found too weak, to ward off ſome impreſſion of that, which with an awful appearance and authority does juſtify it ſelf to the conſcience, without their conſent; nor can this ſecure them from that laſh of inward ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, which will make theſe tremble alone, when they ſeem to have confidence before others; but this advantage the <hi>truth</hi> hath of her adverſaries, that even <hi>Atheiſm</hi> muſt bear a <hi>witneſs thereto,</hi> and againſt it ſelf; which if men would but weigh in the ballance of ſober reaſon, it ſhould appear a ſufficient antidote againſt its own poiſon, and a great ſeal to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which would want a ſpecial confirmation, if it wanted ſuch an adverſary. Now to clear it a little more, and thus ſhut up what hath been on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject held forth, I muſt in behalf of the glorious truth of God (which in all ages of the Church did never want ſome diſcovery of its accompliſhment) atteſt the <hi>reproachers</hi> of this time, who are ſo much at work to challenge his unſpotted way, and call in queſtion his faithfulneſs, to the weakning of the aſſent of many
<pb n="518" facs="unknown:005185_0553_1016DF428363DFC8"/>
thereto, and do appeal them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>tribunal</hi> which the great God hath placed in the <hi>conſcience,</hi> if they can without doing violence thereto, and putting out the eye of reaſon, withſtand the clear evidences of divine truth, and the certainty of its performance. About which theſe few things I ſhall here add.</p>
            <p>(1.) If it be the great <hi>prerogative of God,</hi> and to him alone belongs to <hi>declare things from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end,</hi> and hold forth the various and moſt remarkable events, which ſhould fall out with in time, with their proper circumſtances, yea, to diſcover the great revolutions of the world through all the ages thereof, when ſecond cauſes in their remoteſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereto could not be diſcerned; <hi>is not this</hi> then clear and undeniably true of the Scripture?—(2.) As to ſure and exact <hi>performance</hi> of the ſame, I muſt make that challenge and atteſtation, which that great ſervant of the Lord <hi>Joſhua</hi> did in ſuch a caſe (<hi>Joſ.</hi> 23. 14.) <hi>if any thing hath hitherto failed, of all which the Lord hath ſpoken</hi> in the Scripture! or if men can inſtance, what ſpecial <hi>prediction</hi> or <hi>promiſe</hi> (which to this day ſhould have taken place in the ſeaſon thereof) hath miſcarried, or turned abortive; what <hi>truth</hi> wants its ſeal and confirmation; yea, what ſtep of <hi>providence</hi> can you point at, which does not quadrate and marvellouſly <hi>accord</hi> with the <hi>word?</hi> I challenge an inſtance. But this, I am ſure, men muſt ſee, there are ſuch things fall out in the event, that are particularly foretold in the Scripture; ſo ſtrange and marvellous, that in an ordinary way none could have believed, which they now ſee with their own eyes.—(3.) Do you not ſee the <hi>written word</hi> as a bright <hi>lantern</hi> attend the <hi>Church,</hi> from the very porch and entry of time, in all her journey; and evidently point at the <hi>remarkable times</hi> and <hi>revolutions</hi> of her caſe, which have now in a great part gone over her
<pb n="519" facs="unknown:005185_0554_1016DF44246B8838"/>
head? Yea, is it not demonſtratively clear, that the ſun doth not more truly ſhine on this terreſtrial globe, than the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſhineth, and doth illuminate the whole frame and ſtructure of <hi>Providence;</hi> and in all thoſe ſtrange parts which are acted in the world, moſt certainly takes place; that there is none can walk at random, or by his own counſel direct and ſteer his his courſe! But though it is marvellous, it is ſure alſo, that the innumerable millions of men, who are this day upon earth, in all their various motions, are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fulfilling the <hi>determined counſel of God;</hi> and their actings (what ever they deſign therein) muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick with his great end, nor out of that bounds can they poſſibly move.—(4.) I muſt atteſt the world, if they do not ſee, <hi>this way of godlineſs,</hi> which ſeems to day to be <hi>every where ſpoken againſt,</hi> to be that <hi>good</hi> and <hi>old way,</hi> in which are <hi>the footſteps of the Saints</hi> to be found ſince the beginning; and that it is no <hi>new light</hi> now broke out in the world: but it is clear, through all ages paſt there hath not wanted a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſucceſſion of theſe, who in <hi>this reproached way did ſerve the God of their fathers;</hi> and have ſealed the truth, which now, from one time to another, we find ſtill delivered off their hands, to the preſent generation. And I here challenge the greateſt Atheiſts, <hi>to which of the Saints can they turn,</hi> or whom can they inſtance of that bleſſed company, ſince there was a Church in the earth, who could never contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this, or bear an other witneſs!—(5.) Muſt you not confeſs, there is <hi>no ſuch deep in the heart of man,</hi> or ſo cloſe and ſubtil a convoy of wickedneſs there, which is not found out in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and there <hi>pointed at;</hi> and that none can get themſelves hid, or get beyond the reach of <hi>this,</hi> in thoſe things which they are ſure the obſerving world could never know: but the moſt ſecret haunts of their ſoul are unvailed, which from their deareſt friend they have conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—(6.)
<pb n="520" facs="unknown:005185_0555_1016DF45B4F743E0"/>
Can this demonſtration of the Scripture, and ſo manifeſt a witneſs thereto be denied, that whilſt man is a <hi>free agent</hi> in his actions, and doth therein act ſpontaneouſly, he hath notwithſtanding of this in his own breaſt both a <hi>judge,</hi> and <hi>accuſer;</hi> which, though within him, doth without his conſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe a power over him, and ſuch an authority which he would, yet cannot decline?—(7.) I dare atteſt the conſcience of men, who are themſelves <hi>ſtrangers</hi> to the way of God, if they can ſo far ſhut their eyes, but they muſt ſee that <hi>ſerious godlineſs</hi> is a <hi>marvellous</hi> thing, and that there is ſomething here <hi>above nature,</hi> which by its effects on others, may ſhew a <hi>divine</hi> Spirit and power; that, wherever it comes, makes ſo great a <hi>change,</hi> and one to <hi>exceed</hi> an other moſt diſcernably, though of the ſame parts; that <hi>ſuits</hi> and does accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate it ſelf to the <hi>various</hi> conditions and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men; it puts a ſpecial honour on the greateſt Prince, and does inſtruct the wiſe and prudent, yet will it lodge with the pooreſt artificer in his ſhop, or labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man in the field! And does it not alſo appear, that here muſt be a native motion unconſtrained and from <hi>inward principles,</hi> when on outward grounds there is not the leaſt incitement; which ſhews it is a <hi>living</hi> thing, that hath its diſcernable languiſhing and wearing out, and its more vigorous actings, as well as any living man! It is ſtrange, the <hi>report</hi> of this is not matter of <hi>aſtoniſhment;</hi> to bring men once to queſtion, if ſuch an account as others give of this marvellous thing (<hi>Religion</hi>) can be true; how it is here, the Chriſtian's <hi>joy</hi> is ſown by <hi>weeping,</hi> and his tears the ſeed whence gladneſs of heart breaks forth; how ſweet that <hi>reſt</hi> is, which is found in his <hi>work</hi> and labour; and with his <hi>ſowing to the ſpirit,</hi> the harveſt then begins, in a preſent <hi>reaping;</hi> and his laying forth himſelf, with a giving of the heart unto God, does enrich the giver by ſuch a gift: yea, that here men
<pb n="521" facs="unknown:005185_0556_1016DF4B6D47F6F8"/>
ſhould <hi>differ</hi> ſo much when <hi>alone with God</hi> and brought <hi>near</hi> him, from what they are at other times; and in thoſe retirements of their ſoul, have that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and conception of the truth, which is not to be found in turning over the voluminous tractates of the greateſt writers.—(8.) If men have any ſerious reflection, and do not ſhut up the bible, can they ſhun this remark thereof? How well it <hi>anſwers</hi> the various <hi>ſucceſſions of time,</hi> and ſo marvellous a <hi>variety of things,</hi> that are ſo many ages diſtant from other; yea, that all along there is a <hi>gradual</hi> diſcovery, and breaking out of the goſpel, in the ſeveral times of the Church; where it is eaſy to diſcern the <hi>antiquity</hi> of this excellent record, and ſo great a <hi>diſtance of time</hi> betwixt the <hi>penmen</hi> thereof, yet in its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is <hi>one entire piece,</hi> ſo connex and cloſely knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that men may ſee the <hi>ſame ſpirit</hi> in the whole, and in each part thereof, moving and carrying for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward one great deſign!—(9.) I ſhall but further add, if <hi>Religion</hi> hath a <hi>being</hi> and <hi>reality,</hi> which men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loſe the ſenſe of, and deny, without falling ſo far below reaſon, into the condition of the beaſts, muſt there not be a <hi>rule</hi> alſo? For it is eaſy to judge, in what a ſtrange and monſtrous ſhape this would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, were it left to the <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>arbitrement of men.</hi> Now let the moſt profeſſed <hi>Atheiſts</hi> turn their eyes through the whole earth, and in a calm and ſober compoſure of ſpirit but judge, if there be any thing more <hi>abſurd,</hi> and to aſtoniſhment irrational, than <hi>that face</hi> and <hi>appearance,</hi> which religion hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe where this excellent rule of the <hi>Scripture</hi> is not owned. Yea, could theſe ſubject themſelves to ſuch extravagancies, and therein turn ſo mad, without a <hi>divine ſtroke</hi> on their <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>reaſon,</hi> which the righteous God, in verification of his <hi>word,</hi> inflicts on ſuch as do even ſhut their ears from the report of the truth, <hi>the ſound whereof goes forth through
<pb n="522" facs="unknown:005185_0557_1016DF4CF6FB5CF8"/>
the earth!</hi> And here I challenge men, tho' ſtrangers themſelves to ſerious religion, if at a diſtance it doth not appear, how great a <hi>difference</hi> there is betwixt thoſe parts of the world, where the <hi>goſpel</hi> ſhines in its <hi>power,</hi> and the reſt of the nations.</p>
