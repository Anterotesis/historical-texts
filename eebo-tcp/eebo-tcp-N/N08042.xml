            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Knowledge of the Hiſtory of any Society is very neceſſary to direct the Governors of it, how to conduct with Wiſdom, Uniformity and Juſtice; and may be uſeful and entertaining to many Others.</p>
            <p>At the Deſire of the Reverend Truſtees of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, in the Year <hi>1744,</hi> I compiled the Subſtance of this Hiſtory, to that Time; which was read and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by them.—It was collected principally from the Records and original Papers; but ſeveral Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, tending to ſet the Whole in a clear Light, I received from ſundry Gentlemen, who were contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with the Facts related; among which were ſome of the Founders of the College, with whom I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally acquainted in the Year <hi>1726.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As my principal Deſign, in writing this Hiſtory, was to preſerve theſe important Facts from Oblivion, and to tranſmit them down, for the Uſe of Poſterity; I have confined myſelf to the proper Province of an Hiſtorian; which is to give a juſt and ſimple Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Facts, without interſperſing many Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Obſervations or Reflections; leaving them to be made by the judicious and candid Reader.</p>
            <p>And ſince the Want of a certain and exact Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſome ancient Facts, has oftentimes been the Occaſion of Controverſies and Diſputes, I have been more minute in the Relation of ſome Circumſtantials, than may probably be entertaining to Strangers; yet not more than may, hereafter, be really neceſſary, for thoſe who will be immediately concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:010262_0003_0F7E250FF8E29770"/>I have digeſted this Hiſtory in the Form of <hi>ANNALS,</hi> as ſuppoſing that the chronological Order will be moſt eaſily underſtood and remembered: Yet, ſometimes, where Things are neceſſarily connected, I have put them into the ſame Paragraph, altho' they occurred in different Years.</p>
            <p>The greater Part of this Hiſtory being wrote when the Paper-Currency of <hi>New-England</hi> was in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciating State, it was thought beſt that all Sums of Money ſhould be reduced to the <hi>Sterling</hi> Value. — The College-Accounts, before the Year <hi>1726,</hi> are ſomewhat obſcure; and therefore it is probable that ſome Receipts and Diſburſements of Money, before that Time, have not come to my Knowledge; yet, ſince that Time, they ſtand very fair and clear.</p>
            <p>To render this Hiſtory the more complete, I have recited or referred to all the Acts of the Honorable the General Aſſembly, relating to the College.</p>
            <p>I had Thoughts of adding ſomething upon the civil and eccleſiaſtical Privileges of Colleges and Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but ſhall only refer the Reader to thoſe Authors who have wrote largely on that Subject, <hi>viz.</hi> — Dr. <hi>Ayliffe</hi>'s ancient and preſent State of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford; Wood</hi>'s Inſtitutes of the common Law; Bp. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Diſcourſe in the Houſe of Lords; <hi>Conringius,</hi> de Antiquitatibus Academicis; and a ſhort Piece I printed, in the Year <hi>1754,</hi> entitled <hi>The Religious Conſtitution of Colleges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have made Minutes of ſeveral other Things, which may be uſeful to Some; and may hereafter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Materials for the Continuation of this Hiſtory.</p>

            <p>But afterwards ſome began to doubt whether they were fully veſted with a legal Capacity to hold Lands, and whether private Donations and Contributions would yield a Sufficiency to carry on ſo great a Deſign; it was therefore propoſed to make Application to the Hon. the General Aſſembly of the Colony for ſome Aſſiſtance; and to aſk for a <hi>Charter.</hi> The Expediency of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal was debated at ſeveral Meetings; and ſundry Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were uſed on both Sides: and ſome of the ableſt Lawyers both in, and out of the Government, were conſulted upon it. After mature Conſideration, they concluded that it was ſafe and beſt to have a Charter, <note place="margin">1701</note>notwithſtanding any Change of the Government which might poſſibly happen; and wrote to the Hon. Judge <hi>Sewall,</hi> and Mr. Secretary <hi>Addington</hi> of <hi>Boſton</hi> to prepare a Draught of a Charter, to be preſented to the next Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</p>
            <p>Whereupon a large Number of Miniſters and others, drew up and ſigned a Petition to the Hon. the General Aſſembly, repreſenting, <q>That from a ſincere Regard to, and Zeal for, upholding the Proteſtant Religion, by a Succeſſion of learned and orthodox Men, they had propoſed that a Collegiate School ſhould be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Colony, wherein Youth ſhould be inſtructed in all Parts of Learning, to qualify them for publick Employments in Church and Civil State; and that they had nominated ten Miniſters to be Truſtees, Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or Undertakers for the Founding, Endowing and Ordering the ſaid School, viz. The Rev.

               </hi> one of the Council, ſoon after the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly met, made a formal Donation under his Hand, predicated upon <q>the great Pains and Charge which the Miniſters had been at in ſetting up a Collegiate School; and therefore in order to encourage a Work ſo pleaſing to God, and beneficial to Poſterity, he gave a Tract of Land in <hi>Killingly,</hi> of about 600 Acres; and all the Glaſs and Nails which ſhould be neceſſary to build a College Houſe and Hall: and promiſed to give a more ample Conveyance of the Land, as ſoon as it could be reſurveyed.</q>

                        <p>Whereas it was the glorious publick Deſign of our now bleſſed Fathers, in their Remove from <hi>Europe</hi> into theſe Parts of <hi>America,</hi> both to plant, and (under the Divine Bleſſing) to propagate in this Wilderneſs the bleſſed reformed Proteſtant Religion, in the Purity of its Order and Worſhip; not only to their Poſterity, but alſo to the barbarous Natives: In which great Enterprize they wanted not the Royal Commands and Favour of his Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to authorize and invigorate them.</p>

                        <p>For the orderly and effectual Management of this Affair, we agree to and hereby appoint and confirm the following RULES.</p>
                        <p>1ſt, That the Rector take ſpecial Care, as of the moral Behaviour of the Students at all Times, ſo with Induſtry, to inſtruct and ground them well in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical Divinity; and to that End, ſhall neither by himſelf, nor by any other Perſon whomſoever, allow them to be inſtructed and grounded in any <hi>other System or Synopſis of Divinity,</hi> than ſuch as the ſaid Truſtees do order and appoint: But ſhall take effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Care, that the ſaid Students be weekly (at ſuch Seaſons as he ſhall ſee Cauſe to appoint) cauſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriter to recite the Aſſembly's Catechiſm in Latin, and <hi>Ames</hi>'s Theological Theſes, of which, as alſo <hi>Ames</hi>'s <hi>Caſes of Conſcience,</hi> he ſhall make, or cauſe to be made, from Time to Time, ſuch Explanations as may (through the Bleſſing of God,) be moſt conducive to their Eſtabliſhment in the Principles of the Chriſtian Proteſtant Religion.</p>

            <p>With ſundry other Rules and Orders for the Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid School.</p>
            <p>The Truſtees choſe the Rev. Mr. Abraham Pierſon, who was one of their Number, to take the Care of Inſtructing and Governing the Collegiate School; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title and Character of RECTOR.</p>
            <p>And in as much as it was originally propoſed that there ſhould be ten Truſtees beſides the <hi>Rector,</hi> they <q>choſe the Rev. Mr. Samuel Ruſſel, of Branford, to be a Truſtee to complete the Number of Eleven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame Meeting, they entered upon the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the moſt convenient <hi>Place</hi> in the Colony of Connecticut, in which they might erect and fix the Collegiate School: they were not perfectly ſatisfied or united in it; but after a conſiderable Debate they fixed upon <hi>Saybrook,</hi> as the moſt convenient Place, <hi>at Preſent; unleſs upon further Conſideration they ſhould alter their Minds:</hi> And this Matter was debated at ſeveral Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings afterwards.</p>
            <p>They alſo deſired the Rector to remove himſelf and Family to <hi>Saybrook;</hi> but till that could be effected, they ordered that the Scholars ſhould be inſtructed at or near the Rector's Houſe in <hi>Killingworth.</hi> As this School
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010262_0015_0F7E2518A4D3A490"/>
was ſome Years in forming,<note place="margin">1702</note> ſeveral young Gentlemen were preparing for it under the more private Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome one of the Truſtees or others: After the School became furniſhed with a Rector and a Tutor, eight of them were admitted, and put into different Claſſes, according to the proficiency they had antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently made. So that in a Year or two ſome were qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for Degrees.</p>
            <p>The firſt Commencement was held at Saybrook, on Sept. 13th, 1702. at which four young Gentlemen, who had before been graduated at the College at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and one more, who had a private Education, received the Degrees of Maſter of Arts. This and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Commencements following were held privately in the Houſe of the Rev. Mr. Buckingham, becauſe the Truſtees by a preceding Act, had forbid all publick Commencements; to avoid the Charge and other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences attending them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Nathaniel Lynde of Saybrook, was pleaſed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly to give a Houſe and Land for the Uſe of the Collegiate School, ſo long as it ſhould be continued at <hi>Saybrook.</hi> And James Fitch, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in purſuance of his generous Donation made in October laſt, gave an ample Deed of 637 Acres of Land at Killingly. There was alſo a general Contribution throughout the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,<note place="margin">1703</note> to build a College Houſe at Saybrook, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the College ſhould be finally fixed: But we have no Account what was obtained by it.</p>
            <p>The Truſtees had a ſpecial Meeting at <hi>Guilford,</hi> March 17th, 1703, and wrote a Circular Letter to the Miniſters, propoſing "to have a general Synod of all the Churches in the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to give their joint Conſent to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010262_0016_0F7E25191BC05AD8"/>
the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> after the Example of the Synod in <hi>Boſton,</hi> in 1680." This Propoſal being univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, the Churches in the ſeveral Counties met in a conſociated Council, and aſſented to the <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> or <hi>Savoy</hi> Confeſſions; and drew up ſome Rules of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Diſcipline; as Matters preparatory to the Synod. Then each Council choſe ſix Delegates, that is, three Miniſters and three Meſſengers, to meet in a general Synod. This Synod met at <hi>Saybrook,</hi> in 1708: And having compared the ſeveral Draughts of the Councils in each County, unanimouſly agreed in theſe three general Acts.</p>
            <p n="1">Iſt. They drew up and conſented to <hi>a Confeſſion of Faith;</hi> which is the ſame in Subſtance, and nearly in the ſame Words with the <hi>Westminſter</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> Confeſſions.</p>
            <p n="2">IId. They conſented to the general Plan of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Government, contained in <hi>the Heads of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſented to, by the united Miniſters, in England, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called Preſbyterian and Congregational.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">IIIdly. They drew up ſome particular <hi>Articles and Rules for the Adminiſtration of Church Diſcipline.</hi> The Subſtance of which (ſo far as they ſeemed to contain any Thing new) was this, that whereas in former Times the Boundaries of the ſeveral Councils of Churches Conſociated for mutual Aſſiſtance, were <hi>unfixed,</hi> and left in the general Terms of the <hi>Neighbouring Churches.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">See Cambridge Platform, Chap. XV. Synod at Boſton, <hi>1662.</hi>
               </note> Now the ſeveral Neighbourhoods of Churches were more preciſely bounded, and limited to the reſpective <hi>Counties</hi> or <hi>Districts.</hi> Theſe Acts of the Synod were eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the civil Government: And are called the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches of the Colony of Connecticut:</hi> And are frequently referred to in the Acts of the Truſtees; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the original Plan of the College, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in Page 2d.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:010262_0017_0F7E2519D3E5DB58"/>The Truſtees made ſeveral Eſſays to remove the Rector, with his Family, to <hi>Saybrook,</hi> and propoſed to give him 50 Pounds Sterling, to bear the Charges of his Removal, and 60 Pounds Sterling Salary per Annum. But as this Encouragement was but ſmall, and his Removal was ſtrongly oppoſed by his People, and many of the Truſtees were not ſo well ſatisfied in fixing the College at <hi>Saybrook,</hi> as to act with ſo much Vigour as otherwiſe they would have done; his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval was never effected; but the Students continued at <hi>Killingworth</hi> till his Death;<note place="margin">1707</note> which was in April 1707, to the unſpeakable Grief and Loſs both of the College and of his People.</p>
            <p>He was educated at Harvard College and graduated there Anno. 1668; was a hard Student, a good Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, a great Divine, and a wiſe, ſteady and judicious Gentleman in all his Conduct: He was for many Years a faithful and well reſpected Paſtor of the Church in Killingworth, and after he was choſen Rector, he inſtructed and governed the Infant College with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Approbation; and compoſed a Syſtem of Natural Philoſophy, which the Students recited for many Years.</p>
            <p>Upon the Death of Mr. Rector Pierſon, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Andrew</hi> of <hi>Milford,</hi> was choſen Rector pro Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, until one could be obtained who ſhould reſide at the Collegiate School. Upon which the Senior Claſs were removed to Milford, to be under his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Care and Inſtruction till the Commencement. The reſt of the Students were removed to Saybrook, and put under the Care of two Tutors.</p>
            <p>The Tutors and Students being now about twenty in Number, reſided and boarded in private Houſes, where they could be beſt accommodated. And the Students
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010262_0018_0F7E251CBB244240"/>
every Day came to their Tutors Chambers to Recita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Prayers: Mr. <hi>Andrew</hi> moderated at the Commencements, and ſometimes gave or ſent Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Tutors, in ſpecial Caſes: But inaſmuch as he lived at a great Diſtance, Mr. <hi>Buckingham</hi> of <hi>Saybrook,</hi> one of the Truſtees, (while he lived) was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to have ſome Kind of Inſpection over the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Students. In this obſcure State the College continued at <hi>Saybrook</hi> about ſeven Years, without any remarkable Occurrent or Alteration. And the Truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees not being fully agreed or ſatisfied in their own Minds about the Place of the College; and their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes being ſcarce ſufficient to ſettle and ſupport a Reſident Rector; they made no conſiderable Attempts to procure one in all that ſpace of Time.</p>
            <p>About this Time ſundry Donations of valuable Books were made to the Library,<note place="margin">1713</note> particularly by Sir <hi>John Davie,</hi> of <hi>Groton,</hi> who had an Eſtate deſcended to him in <hi>England,</hi> together with the Title of Baronet: Upon his going to England, he ſent a good Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Books to the Library.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt Donation of all was by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity and Procurement of <hi>Jeremiah Dummer,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Boſton,</hi> then Agent at <hi>London,</hi> who in the Year 1714 ſent above 800 Volumes of very valuable Books; about 120 of which were at his own Coſt and Charge; and the reſt by his Procurement from ſundry princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Gentlemen in England; particularly Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Blackmore,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Steele,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> Dr. <hi>Halley,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bently,</hi> Dr. <hi>Kennet,</hi> Dr. <hi>Calamy,</hi> Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> the Rev.

               <note place="margin">1714</note>The Truſtees and the Colony in general were from the Beginning, not very well agreed in their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about the Place where to fix the College; and moſt Men's Sentiments were influenced by their Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and they generally choſe that Place which would beſt accommodate themſelves. Three or four Places were generally diſcourſed upon viz. <hi>Saybrook, Hew-Haven,</hi> and <hi>Hartford</hi> or <hi>Weathersfield.</hi> The Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars were alſo ſomewhat uneaſy at their Situation, they thought that Saybrook was not compact enough for their Accommodation, ſince many of them were obliged to reſide above a Mile from the Place of publick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,<note place="margin">1715</note> and they were not pleaſed with their Inſtruction and Government; there being no reſident Rector, and the Tutors ſometimes very young.

               <note place="margin">Apr. 4 1716</note> and called the Students before them, and enquired into the Occaſion of their Uneaſineſs and Diſorder.

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> and Mr. <hi>Buckingham</hi> were very deſirous to ſtop the Proceedings of the Truſtees in <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and therefore in <hi>October</hi> following, they entered a Kind of Remonſtrance to the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, then ſitting at <hi>New-Haven:</hi> wherein they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, that the Votes of the Truſtees for fixing the College at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> paſt October 17th, 1716, and April 5th, 1717, were not legal Votes; for that the Major Part of the Truſtees were not in them. That there were Nine Truſtees at leaſt, ſubſiſting in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1716, and but Four of them in the Vote, viz. Mr. <hi>Andrew,</hi> Mr. <hi>Webb,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> and Mr. <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Ruggles</hi> was choſen before he was forty Years of Age, and therefore that Choice was null. And that Mr. <hi>James Noyes's</hi> Conſent to that Act, at ſuch a Diſtance and ſo long after, could be no Confirmation of it. And that in the Act of April 1717, there were but Five Truſtees out of Ten.</p>
            <p>To which the Truſtees, being then convened, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That in October 1716, there were but Nine Truſtees, Mr. <hi>Pierpont</hi> being dead, and none then choſen in his Room; and Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> of <hi>Windſor</hi> had been Bed-rid many Years, and had reſigned the Miniſtry; and therefore could not be look'd upon as a Truſtee. That if it ſhould be granted that Mr. <hi>Ruggles</hi> could not act as a Truſtee, at the Time when he was firſt nominated, yet he was forty Years old before the paſſing of that Vote; and the Truſtees by permitting him, in purſuance to a former Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010262_0024_0F7E25209C399218"/>
to ſit and act with them, thereby <hi>aſſociated</hi> him, according to the Charter. That inaſmuch as the Truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees were not limited in their Way and Manner of acting or voting, Mr. <hi>Noyes,</hi> tho' abſent from the Meeting, might give his Conſent to an Act by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing it at home, within two or three Months after, as well as if he had been preſent. And ſo there was a Majority of Six out of Nine. And in April 1717, after Mr. <hi>Stephen Buckingham</hi> was choſen, there was a Majority of Six out of Ten. But if Mr. <hi>Ruggles</hi> ſhould not be reckoned at either of the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor Mr. <hi>Noyes,</hi> nor any other Truſtee when abſent, then there will be a Majority of thoſe who were preſent, which makes a legal Act.</p>
            <p>Whereupon the upper Houſe were of Opinion, <q>that the Objections againſt the Vote of the Truſtees were inſufficient.</q> And after a long Debate in the lower Houſe, they did not ſee Cauſe to Vote any Thing upon it.</p>

That they look'd upon <hi>New-Haven</hi> to be in itſelf the moſt convenient Place, on the Account of the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of its Situation, the agreableneſs of the Air and Soil, and the Cheapneſs of Commodities; and that very large Donations had been made towards the Building an Houſe there, without which they had not ſufficient to defray the Charge.</p>
            <p>The Major Part of the General Aſſembly, being deſirous to ſtrengthen the Hands of the Truſtees in the preſent Difficulties, paſt the following Vote, in the ſame Seſſion, viz. <q>That under the preſent Circumſtances of the Affairs of the Collegiate School, the Rev. Truſtees be adviſed to proceed in that Affair; and to finiſh the Houſe they have built in <hi>New-Haven,</hi> for the Entertainment of the Scholars belonging to the Collegiate School.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe Votes of the Truſtees and the General Aſſembly, ſome Gentlemen ſtill purſued their Deſign of carrying the College to <hi>Weathersfield,</hi> and therefore encouraged the Scholars there, which were about 14 in Number,<note place="margin">1718</note> to continue there: and in May following they again moved the Affair to the General Aſſembly at <hi>Hartford.</hi> The lower Houſe voted, <q>to deſire the Truſtees, to Conſent that the Commencements ſhould be held alternately at <hi>Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersfield</hi> and <hi>New-Haven,</hi> till the Place of the School be fully determined.</q> The Upper Houſe were of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010262_0026_0F7E252212CB1C88"/>
Opinion that the Place of the <q>School was fully determined already, by the indiſputable Votes of the Truſtees, and the ſubſequent Advice of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thereupon;</q> and therefore did not concur.</p>
            <p>Preſently after this, the Collegiate School at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> received ſundry very large and generous Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; (which were very acceptable at this difficult Time.) The greateſt of which was from the Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable ELIHU YALE, of <hi>London,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of the Eaſt-India Company. He was Heir to a Manor in <hi>Wales,</hi> of the Value of 500 Pounds Sterling per Annum, beſides the vaſt Treaſures he got by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Induſtry while he was in the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> The paternal Eſtate (as it was ſaid) being entailed to the Male Heir of the Family, and he, having no Son, but three Daughters, ſent to his firſt Couſin and next Male Heir Mr. <hi>John Yale</hi> of <hi>New-Haven,</hi> with whom he had been formerly acquainted in <hi>England,</hi> to ſend him one of his Sons, to inherit the paternal Eſtate. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in the Year 1712, he ſent his Son Mr. <hi>David Yale,</hi> to London, who upon his Return was graduated at this College 1724.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things brought Governor YALE into Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Honorable Governor <hi>Saltonſtall</hi> and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Pierpont</hi> of <hi>New-Haven,</hi> which was the Occaſion of his generous Donations. In the Year 1714 he ſent 40 Volumes of Books in Mr. <hi>Dummer's</hi> Collection. Laſt Year he ſent above 300 Volumes, both which Parcels I ſuppoſe to be worth 100 Pounds Sterling. This Summer he ſent Goods to the Value of 200 Pounds Sterling at prime Coſt, beſides the King's Picture and Arms; with ſome Intimations that he would yet add; and accordingly three Years after, he ſent to the Value of 100 Pounds more; both which
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010262_0027_0F7E252333F66DE0"/>
Parcels were ſold here for an Equivalent to 400 Pounds Sterling.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Dummer</hi> at this Time alſo ſent 76 Volumes of Books, whereof 20 were Folios, in Value about 30 Pounds Sterling. The Honorable <hi>Gurdon Saltonſtall,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>Jahaleel Brenton,</hi> of Newport, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> gave, each of them, 50 Pounds Sterling.</p>
            <p>Upon the Receipt of theſe and other large Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Circumſtances of the Collegiate School were very much altered for the better, and the Truſtees were now well enabled to finiſh the large and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious College Houſe, which they had before erected; it was raiſed on the 8th Day of October 1717, and within a Year after was ſo far finiſhed, as to be fit for the commodious Reception of the Students. It was 170 Feet long, 22 Feet wide, and 3 Story high; made a handſome Appearance, and contained near 50 Studies in convenient Chambers, beſides the Hall, Library and Kitchin, and Coſt about 1000 Pounds Sterling.</p>
            <p>On September 12, 1718, there was a ſplendid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement held at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> where were preſent, beſides the Truſtees, the Honorable GURDON SAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TONSTALL, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of the Colony of <hi>Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut,</hi> the Honorable <hi>William Taylor,</hi>

            <p>The Truſtees, in Commemoration of <hi>Governor Yale</hi>'s great Generoſity, called the Collegiate School, after his Name, YALE-COLLEGE; and entred a Memorial thereof upon Record, which is as follows.</p>

                  <p>THE Trustees of the <hi>Collegiate School,</hi> conſtituted in the ſplendid Town of <hi>New-Haven,</hi> in <hi>Connecticut,</hi> being enabled by the moſt Generous Donation of the Honorable <hi>ELIHU YALE,</hi>

            <p>On the Commencement Day Morning, this Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Generoſity and Gratitude was with ſolemn Pomp read off in the College Hall, both in Latin and Engliſh; then the Proceſſion moved to the Meeting-Houſe, to attend the Publick Exerciſes of the Day: Wherein, beſides the Oration made by one of the Bachelors, the Rev. Mr. <hi>John Davenport,</hi> one of the Truſtees, at the Deſire of the Body, made a florid Oration, wherein he largely inſiſted upon and highly extolled the Generoſity of <hi>Governor Yale.</hi> Eight Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates received the Honour of a Degree of Bachelor of Arts; and ſeveral more were created Maſters. And the Honorable Governor <hi>Saltonſtall</hi> was pleaſed to Grace and Crown the whole Solemnity, with an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Latin Oration; wherein he congratulated the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

happy State of the College, in being ſixed at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and enrich'd with ſo many noble Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions; and particularly celebrated the great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of <hi>Governor Yale,</hi> with much Reſpect and Honour.</p>
            <p>After this the Truſtees ſent a very Complaiſant Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Thanks to Governor <hi>Yale;</hi> and gave him a particular Account of all the Tranſactions at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement. They alſo ſent a Letter of Thanks to their great Friend and Patron <hi>Jeremiah Dummer,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> for his late Donation of Books; and another to the Honorable General <hi>Nicholſon</hi> for his Donation of Books in Mr. <hi>Dummer</hi>'s Collection; and for a late Donation, the Number or Value of which I can't find.</p>
            <p>On the ſame Day upon which the Commencement was carried on at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> ſomething like a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement was carried on at <hi>Weathersfield,</hi> before a large Number of Spectators; five Scholars, who were originally of the Claſs, which now took their Degrees at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> performed publick Exerciſes; the Rev. Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> acted as Moderator; and he and Mr. <hi>Buckingham</hi> and other Miniſters preſent ſigned Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, that they judged them to be worthy of the Degree of Bachelor of Arts; theſe Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> delivered to them in a formal Manner in the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe; which was commonly taken and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as giving them their Degrees.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this Irregularity, which wiſe and good Men fell into in a Time of Strife and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet the Truſtees were diſpoſed to condeſcend, as far as poſſible, to gain and reconcile thoſe who had withdrawn from them; and therefore ordered,<note place="margin">Sept. 13.</note> 
               <q>that if any of thoſe Five Scholars ſhould produce to the Rector, a Teſtimony under the Hands of any two
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010262_0031_0F7E4865922E7EC8"/>
Truſtees, of their having been approved by them, as qualified for a Degree, the Rector upon eaſy and reaſonable Terms, ſhould give them a Diploma in the uſual Form, and that their Names ſhould be inſerted in the Claſs, as they were at firſt placed;</q>
which was done accordingly. They alſo directed the reſt of the Scholars remaining at <hi>Weathersfield</hi> to come to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and paid for their Tuition while they were there.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Oct. 9.</note>The General Aſſembly in October following, <q>in Order to quiet the Minds of People, and introduce a general Harmony in the Publick Affairs, ordered that a <hi>State Houſe</hi> ſhould be built at <hi>Hartford,</hi> to compenſate for the College at <hi>New-Haven;</hi> that 25 Pounds Sterling ſhould be given to <hi>Saybrook</hi> for the Uſe of the School, to compenſate for the Removal of the College: That the Governor and Council ſhould, at the Deſire of the Truſtees, give ſuch Orders as they ſhould think proper for the Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Library from <hi>Saybrook</hi> to <hi>New-Haven:</hi> That the Scholars at <hi>Weathersfield,</hi> ſhould go to <hi>New-Haven;</hi> and the College ſhould be carried on, promoted and encouraged at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and all due Care taken for its flouriſhing.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In December following the Governor and Council, at the Deſire of the Truſtees, met at <hi>Saybrook;</hi> and gave a Warrant to the Sheriff, to deliver the Books to the Truſtees. The Houſe where the Books were, was filled and ſurrounded with a great Number of Men, who were determined to prevent the Removal of the Books; and therefore reſiſted the Officer: But he, with his Attendants, broke open the Door, and delivered the Books to the Truſtees, or their
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010262_0032_0F7E4865A9988770"/>
Order; and ſo they were conveyed to <hi>New-Haven.</hi> But in this Tumult and Confuſion, about 250 of the moſt valuable Books, and ſundry Papers of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance were conveyed away by unknown Hands, and never could be found again.</p>
            <p>After this unhappy Struggle, the Spirits of Men began, by Degrees to ſubſide; and a general Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was gradually introduced among the Truſtees, and the Colony in general. The Rev. Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> and Mr. <hi>Buckingham</hi> became very friendly to the College at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and forward to promote all its Intereſts. The Truſtees, in Teſtimony of their Friendſhip and Regard to Mr. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> choſe him <hi>Rector pro Tempore;</hi> and he accordingly moderated and gave Degrees at the Commencement Anno 1723. Yet in this Time of Anarchy and Confuſion, while all College Order and Authority was in a Manner diſſolved, the Scholars contracted ſuch licentious and vicious Habits, as were not wholly ſuppreſſed and extirpated out of the College in ſeveral Years.</p>
            <p>Governor <hi>Yale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1721</note> the great Benefactor to this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege died July 8th, 1721. He deſcended from an ancient and wealthy Family in <hi>Wales;</hi> who for many Generations poſſeſt the Manor of <hi>Plas Grannow,</hi> and ſeveral other Meſſuages, near the City of <hi>Wrexham,</hi> of the yearly Value of 500 Pounds. <hi>Thomas Yale,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Governor's Father, for the Sake of Religion, came over to <hi>America</hi> with the firſt Settlers of <hi>New-Haven,</hi> in the Year 1638. Here the Governor was born, April 5, 1648. He went to <hi>England</hi> at the Age of about 10 Years; to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> at about 30, where he lived near 20 Years; acquired a very great Eſtate, was made Governor of Fort <hi>St. George;</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:010262_0033_0F7E48666EFB2538"/>
married an Indian-Lady of Fortune, the Relict of Governor <hi>Hinmers,</hi> his Predeceſſor; by whom he had three Daughters; viz. <hi>Katharine,</hi> who was afterwards married to <hi>Dudley North,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> commonly called <hi>Lord North. Ann,</hi> who was married to the Lord <hi>James Cavendiſh,</hi> Uncle to the Duke of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi> And <hi>Urſula,</hi> who died unmarried. After his Return to <hi>London,</hi> he was choſen Governor of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company; and made the Donations beforementioned. And it is ſaid, that a little before his Death, he wrote his Will, wherein he gave 500 Pounds more: But afterwards, thinking it was beſt to execute that Part of his Will in his Life-time, he packed up Goods to that Value, ready to be ſent; but before they were ſhipped, he took a Journey into <hi>Wales,</hi> and died at <hi>Wrexham,</hi> in or near the Seat of his Anceſtors. So that the Goods were not ſent; neither could the Will obtain a <hi>Probate;</hi> altho' Governor <hi>Saltonſtall</hi> took much Pains to effect it.</p>
            <p>He was a Gentleman, who greatly abounded in good Humour and Generoſity, as well as in Wealth: And his Name and Memory will be gratefully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated in YALE-COLLEGE.</p>
            <p>After the College was fixed at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> was enriched with ſundry noble Benefactions, and had a handſome and commodious Houſe built for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Students, it began to flouriſh; and was much more taken Notice of in the World, than it was in its more obſcure State at <hi>Saybrook.</hi> The Number of the Students was now about 40, who were under two Tutors, and ſometimes viſited by Mr. <hi>Andrew,</hi> Rector pro Tempore. But yet the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege was under great Inconveniencies both with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Government and Inſtruction, for want of a Reſident Rector.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:010262_0034_0F7E486725D9AE98"/>The Truſtees therefore met at New-Haven,<note place="margin">1719</note> in March 1719, and choſe the Rev. Mr. <hi>Timothy Cutler,</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Stratford,</hi> to be Reſident Rector, till the next Meeting of the Truſtees. He preſently came to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and entred upon the Buſineſs. At the next Commencement the Truſtees voted, <q>that Mr. Cutler's Service hitherto in the Place of a Rector was to their good Satisfaction, and therefore they deſired him to continue in it.<note place="margin">1720</note>
               </q> And after ſeveral Conferences with, and Propoſals to the People at <hi>Stratford,</hi> it was finally agreed, that the People at <hi>Stratford</hi> ſhould have Mr. <hi>Cutler</hi>'s Houſe and Home-lot there, in Conſideration of his Removal; and that the Truſtees ſhould give him 84 Pounds Sterling for it: Which was paid out of the 120 Pounds lately given by the General Aſſembly, by the Sale of Lands.<note place="margin">1721</note>
            </p>
            <p>To accommodate the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cutler</hi> and his Family, the Truſtees built the Rector's Houſe,<note place="margin">1722</note> in the Year 1722, which with the Land and Appurtenances Coſt 260 Pounds Sterling, of which 35 Pounds was raiſed by Subſcription, 55 Pounds by a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, 115 Pounds by Impoſt on Rum, and 55 Pounds out of Governor Yale's laſt Donation.</p>
            <p>The College ſeemed now to be in a ſettled and flouriſhing State, but there was a ſudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Change; for at the next Commencement, it was diſcovered, that the Rector, one of the Tutors, and two of the neighbouring Miniſters had agreed to leave the Communion of the Churches in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and to go to <hi>England</hi> for epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Ordination. This Event was ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing to the Truſtees and to the Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for at that Time there was not one epiſcopal Miniſter in the Colony of <hi>Connecticut;</hi> and but very
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010262_0035_0F7E4867E4D100C8"/>
few of the Laity, who were epiſcopally inclined. Whereupon the Truſtees met, and paſſed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Votes.</p>

In this Interval the Truſtees agreed, that each of them, by turns, ſhould reſide at College, about a Month at a Time, with the Authority of a Rector. But this Form of Government did not very well anſwer the End; for tho' there were ſeveral Inſtances of ſtrict Diſcipline and Puniſhment of Offences; yet the ill Habits for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly contracted by the Students were not eaſily and ſuddenly eradicated, and before the Vice-Rector could have Time to learn ſufficient Experience how to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his Office to Advantage, he reſigned his Poſt. But at the Commencements, Mr. <hi>Andrew</hi> moderated, and gave Degrees, in the Years 1724, 1725 and 1726.</p>

               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:010262_0040_0F7E487126656050"/>The Rev. Dr. GEORGE BERKELEY, then Dean of <hi>Derry,</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Cloyne,</hi> came into <hi>North-America,</hi> in Order to found an Epiſcopal College. He reſided a Year or two at <hi>Newport</hi> in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> where he purchaſed a Country Seat, with about 96 Acres of Land; and became acquainted with the Rev. Mr. <hi>Jared Eliot</hi> of <hi>Killingworth,</hi> one of the Truſtees, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Samuel Johnſon,</hi> Epiſcopal Miniſter at <hi>Stratford,</hi> and ſome other Gentlemen, who informed him of the State and Genius of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; he had alſo a Correſpondence with Mr. Rector <hi>Williams;</hi> all which were the Occaſions of his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Donations. While he reſided at <hi>Newport,</hi> he ſent all his own Works, a Preſent to the College. It ſo happened, that he did not purſue his Deſign of founding a College in <hi>North-America;</hi> but returned back to <hi>London.</hi> And being a Gentleman who was furniſhed with a great Treaſure of ingenious and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Learning, and endowed with a generous Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to promote and propagate the ſame among Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; he ſent a Deed of his Farm at <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> to this College, in the Year 1732. The Deſcriptions and Conditions in the Deed not being perfectly adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the State of the College, at the Deſire of the Truſtees he, next Year, ſent another Deed, in which it was ordered, that the Rents of the Farm, (after neceſſary Charges are deducted,) ſhould be appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the Maintenance of the Three beſt Scholars in Greek and Latin, who ſhould reſide at College, at leaſt nine Months in a Year, in each of the Three Years between their firſt and ſecond Degrees: That on the 6th Day of May annually, or in Caſe that ſhould be Sunday, on the Seventh, the Candidates ſhould be publickly examined by the Preſident or Rector, and the Senior Epiſcopal Miſſionary within

And in Caſe the Preſident and Senior Miſſionary ſhould not agree in their Sentiments, who are the beſt Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the Caſe ſhall be determined by Lot. And that all Surpluſages of Money which ſhould happen by any Vacancies, ſhall be diſtributed in Greek and Latin Books to ſuch under-graduate Students as ſhould make the beſt Compoſition or Declamation in the Latin Tongue, upon ſuch a moral Theme as ſhall be given them.</p>
            <p>This Premium has been a great Incitement to a laudable Ambition to excell in the Knowledge of the Claſſics.</p>
            <p>At the ſame Time the Rev. Dr. <hi>Berkeley</hi> purſuing his generous Intentions, ſent to this College the fineſt Collection of Books that ever came together at one Time into <hi>America.</hi> The Number was near 1000 Volumes, (including thoſe which he had ſent before) whereof 260 were Folios, and generally very large. I judge that this Collection coſt, at leaſt 400 Pounds Sterling. This Donation of Books was made, partly out of the Doctor's own Eſtate, but principally out of Monies which he procured from ſome generous Gentlemen in <hi>England.</hi> Upon the Receipt of them, the Truſtees ſent the Doctor a Letter of Thanks, and have ſince given him repeated Expreſſions of the grateful Senſe which they retain of his Generoſity towards this College.</p>

            <p>He was educated at <hi>Harvard-College</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and graduated there, Anno. 1711: Was furniſhed with moſt Parts and Kinds of aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Literature: And left the College in a much better State than he found it.

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:010262_0043_0F7E4873A447CBC8"/>October 31, 1739, the Rev.

Meſſieurs <hi>Ebenezer Williams,</hi> and <hi>Samuel Woodbridge,</hi> were appointed a Committee to treat with him and his People, in Order to obtain his Acceptance of the Office. The Committee went to <hi>Windham</hi> on the 10th of November; having given previous Notice of their coming and Deſign. The Generality of the People could not be ſatisfied that it was their Duty to part with their Miniſter, on this Occaſion; on the other Hand they were not ſatisfied that they ſhould be in the Way of their Duty to oppoſe his going; ſo that after a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Debate, they did little or nothing, but left the whole Affair to the Conduct of Providence.</p>
            <p>The Committee moved for the calling of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Churches in the County, to adviſe in this important Affair; who after a publick Hearing of the Objections, which ſome of the People made againſt his Removal, gave it as their Opinion and Advice, <q>That it was Mr. <hi>Clap</hi>'s Duty to accept of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Rector of the College, as being a Call of Providence, to greater and more extenſive Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q> The Committee of the Truſtees conſidering the great Inconveniencies which the College had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſuſtained by the long Intervals in which it was deſtitute of a reſident Rector, urged Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> to be ſpeedy in accepting and undertaking the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Whereupon he concluded to accept of it, as a Call of Providence; and accordingly in December made a Viſit to the College.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1740</note>At a Meeting of the Truſtees, on the 2d Day of April following, he was inſtalled, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Manner, viz. He gave his Conſent to <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010262_0044_0F7E48741375DF60"/>
of Faith</hi> and Rules of Church Diſcipline, agreed upon by the Churches in the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> aſſembled by Delegation at <hi>Saybrook,</hi> in the Year 1708: And gave Satisfaction as to the Soundneſs of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, according to the Act of the Truſtees, Anno. 1722. Then they went into the Hall; the Rev. Mr. <hi>Whitman,</hi> the Moderator began with Prayer; and one of the Students made an Oration proper for the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; then the Moderator made a Speech, in Latin, wherein he committed the Care of inſtructing and governing the College to the Rector; and <hi>he</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the whole with an Oration.</p>
            <p>The Truſtees met at <hi>Hartford</hi> in May following; and the Committee of the firſt Society in <hi>Windham,</hi> moved that they might have Recompence for the Removal of their Paſtor; they mutually agreed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to three Gentlemen of the General Aſſembly, to conſider what Recompence they ought to have; thoſe Gentlemen were of Opinion, that inaſmuch as Mr. <hi>Clap</hi> had been in the Miniſtry at <hi>Windham</hi> 14 Years, which was about Half the Time Miniſters in general continue in their publick Work; the People ought to have Half ſo much as they gave him for a Settlement, which upon Computation was about 53 Pounds Sterling. Whereupon the Truſtees put in a Memorial to the General Aſſembly, praying them to grant that Sum to the People of <hi>Windham;</hi> which they readily did.</p>
            <p>The College was now, in the main, in a good State; yet not ſo perfect, but that it would admit of ſundry Emendations. The Rector therefore endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by all Ways and Means in his Power, to bring it forward towards a State of Perfection. The
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010262_0045_0F7E4874A1632E20"/>
firſt Buſineſs of ſpecial Importance, which he entered upon, was the compiling a Body of Laws. At the firſt founding of this College, it was ordered, that where no ſpecial Proviſion was made by the Truſtees, the Laws of <hi>Harvard-College</hi> ſhould be the Rule. About the Time the College was fixed at <hi>New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> a ſhort Body of Laws was drawn up, which was uſually tranſcribed by the Scholars at their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but theſe, in Time, were found to be very defective; and ſeveral of them became obſolete. In the Year 1735, the Truſtees appointed a Committee with the Rector, to draw up a new Body; but he, being in a declining State of Health, did little or nothing upon it. As ſoon therefore as Rector <hi>Clap</hi> was fixed in his Poſt, the Truſtees deſired him to enter upon the Buſineſs; accordingly a large Body was drawn up, partly out of the ancient Laws and Statutes of this College, partly from the principal and moſt important Cuſtoms which had obtained, partly from the Laws of <hi>Harvard</hi> College, and partly from the Statutes of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford;</hi> and ſome few new ones were added. This Body was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed by a Committee, then by moſt of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at their own Homes, and after ſeveral Readings at the Truſtee's Board, paſſed their Sanction in 1745. Theſe Laws were afterwards tranſlated into Latin and printed in 1748: And ſome Additions have been made ſince, with ſeveral new Editions.</p>
            <p>About the ſame Time the Rector collected and wrote down, under proper Heads, all the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of College, which had from Time to Time obtained and been eſtabliſhed by Practice, which made as large a Volume as the Statutes. By all which Means, the Rules by which the Officers and Students of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege were to conduct themſelves, became better fixed
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010262_0046_0F7E4877BA320A70"/>
and known, and the Government of the College was rendered more ſteady and uniform, and leſs arbitrary.</p>
            <p>Before this Time there never had been any perfect Catalogue of the Books in the Library;<note place="margin">1742</note> for want of which the Students were deprived of much of the Benefit and Advantage of them. The Rector there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore placed all the Books in the Library, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Order (but in Honour to the Rev. Dr. <hi>Berkeley,</hi> for his extraordinary Donation, his Books ſtood by themſelves, at the South End of the Library) and put a <hi>Number</hi> to every Book in it's proper Claſs and Box; and then took three Catalogues of the Books, one as they ſtood in their proper Order on the Shelves; and another in an Alphabetical Order; and a Third, wherein the moſt valuable Books were placed under proper Heads, according to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject Matter of them; together with Figures referring to the Place and Number of each Book. By which Means it might be eaſily known what Books were in the Library upon any particular Subject, and where they might be found, with the utmoſt Expedition. This Catalogue was printed, and was a great Incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Diligence and Induſtry of the Scholars in reading of them. About the ſame Time the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly augmented their annual Grant to the College, whereby they were enabled to ſupport three Tutors, one to each Claſs, including the Rector. This removed a great Inconveniency which the College had before been under by one Tutor's hearing two Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſometimes more. And thereupon the Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſtudied and recited much more than they had done in Years paſt.</p>

exerciſe all the Powers and Privileges therein menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and contained.<note n="‡" place="bottom">This Charter ſet the College in a much more perfect and agreable State, than it was before, and the annual Grant of £. <hi>100,</hi> or a ſuppoſed equivalent in Bills, as ſtated by the General Aſſembly, as often as the depreciated State of the Bills ſeemed to require, was paid by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer, till the Year <hi>1755.</hi> When a French War and heavy Taxes came on, and the Bills were ordered to be called in; ſo that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly did not State an Equivalent, and nothing was paid by the Treaſurer to the College, for ſeveral Years. And by Reaſon of the great Number of Students, about that Time, the College, with great Frugality was able to ſubſiſt. After the Charges of the War were in ſome Meaſure abated, (tho' the Colony was ſtill under preſſing Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) the Aſſembly took the State and Exigencies of the College, into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: And thereupon a Queſtion aroſe, in the Honorable Houſe of Repreſentatives, <q>Whether any legal Claim or Demand could be made upon the ſaid <hi>annual Grant,</hi> or the <hi>Arrearages</hi> of it.</q> This Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was debated at ſeveral Seſſions, and the Houſe were ſo near equally divided in their Sentiments upon it, as that a Major Vote could not be obtained for the Payment or Grant of any Money, upon a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Truth of either Side of the Queſtion. Upon a Propoſal made in the Houſe, <q>That the Preſident and Fellows ſhould do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to remove that Difficulty,</q> and a Committee of the Houſe being thereupon appointed; the Preſident and Fellows, upon the Advice of the ſaid Committee, declared in Writing to the Houſe in October <hi>1765,</hi>

               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:010262_0056_0F7E488135F12C70"/>Mr. <hi>Samuel Lambert,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1746</note> of <hi>New Haven,</hi> a Scotch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, by his Will, dated February 19th, 1718, gave almoſt all his Eſtate, for the Benefit of the College; and ordered, that Ten Pounds ſhould be paid to the Truſtees, towards the Building of the College; and the reſt to be paid, three Pounds Sterling to each Scholar graduated at <hi>New-Haven,</hi> who ſhould ſettle in the Miniſtry; and impowered his Executors to ſell his Lands for that End. The Executors paid the Ten Pounds to the Truſtees, but being informed that there was a large Debt due from the Eſtate, in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> paid nothing to the graduated Miniſters; and they living at a great Diſtance, and ſome Difficulties intervening, did nothing further in many Years. In the mean Time many of the young Miniſters grew uneaſy, and ventured to ſell ſome of the Lands, tho' none of them had any Authority to ſell; and the greater Part had no Right to the Money, becauſe, as the Lands were appraiſed in the Inventory, the Money would all be run out, before it came to them. And other Perſons, who had no Pretence of Right, got into Poſſeſſion of ſome of the Lands, and kept them ſo long as to claim them by Poſſeſſion. And it appeared that Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> was cheated in ſome Parcels, becauſe the Perſons who ſold them to him, had no Right. The Preſident being unwilling that the Eſtate ſhould be loſt, as to the End for which it was given, ſet up a Notification in the Hall at the Commencement 1744, deſiring thoſe Miniſters who had any Intereſt, to meet and conſult upon it. They met and choſe a Committee to Manage the Affair; but they found it attended with ſo many Difficulties that they could not do it, to any Advantage; and therefore agreed to reſign it up to the Preſident and Fellows; who would be under a better Capacity to
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010262_0057_0F7E488168F6ADD8"/>
manage it. Accordingly moſt of thoſe who were ſuppoſed to have any Intereſt, freely reſigned it up to the Preſident and Fellows, to be improved for the Benefit of the College, in ſuch a Manner as they ſhould think beſt; and the reſt of the Rights were purchaſed. And the Executors gave to the Preſident and Fellows a Deed of all the Lands of which Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> died ſeized; whereupon with conſiderable Pains and Expence, they became poſſeſſed of about an Hundred Acres of Land in <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and Sixty Two Acres, lying in five Parcels, in <hi>New-Haven;</hi> excluſive of thoſe ſold by the young Miniſters.</p>
            <p>The Honorable <hi>Phillip Livingston,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> one of his Majeſty's Council for the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had four Sons educated at this College, was pleaſed generouſly to beſtow Twenty Eight Pounds and Ten Shillings Sterling, to be put out to Intereſt, and the Intereſt to be appropriated for the Support of a <hi>Profeſſor of Divinity,</hi> or to any other Uſe the Preſident and Fellows ſhould think to be moſt for the Advantage of the College. And they being of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that a Profeſſor of Divinity would be moſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, appropriated the Donation to that Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1748</note>The Number of Students being about One Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Twenty, more than half of them were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for want of Room, to live out of the College; which was upon many Accounts inconvenient. The Preſident therefore projected a Scheme for building a new College Houſe. And accordingly, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with ſome of the Fellows, obtained of the General Aſſembly in May 1747, the Liberty of a
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010262_0058_0F7E488221938CF0"/>
Lottery for that Purpoſe; by which Five Hundred Pounds Sterling was raiſed, clear of all Charge and Deductions.</p>
            <p>The Foundation of the Houſe was laid April the 17th, 1750. And the Outſide was finiſhed in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1752.<note n="*" place="bottom">It took about <hi>230,000</hi> Bricks, and the Coſt of the Outſide was about £. <hi>1180</hi> Sterling.</note> It is 100 Feet long, 40 Feet wide,<note place="margin">1750</note> and three Story high, beſides the Garrets; and a Cellar under the whole, containing 32 Chambers, and 64 Studies. It makes a good Appearance, and was ſet back in the Yard that there might be a large and handſome Area before it, and toward the North Side of the Yard, with a View that when the old College ſhould come down, another College or Chapel or both ſhould be ſet on the South of the preſent Houſe; and additional Lands were purchaſed on the North and on the Weſt for better Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation.</p>
            <p>The General Aſſembly in October 1749, ordered, that 363 Pounds in the Hands of <hi>Gurdon Saltonſtall,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which came by a French Prize, taken by the Frigate belonging to the Government; and in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1751, ordered that the Remainder of the Prize aforeſaid, and the Effects of the ſaid Frigate (which, after the War, was ſold) amounting to 500 Pounds more, and in October 1754, £. 280 in the Hands of <hi>Gurdon Saltonſtall,</hi> and <hi>Jabez Hamlin,</hi> Eſqrs, on ſome old Accounts, ſhould be paid to the Preſident, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards building the new College.</p>

and the College built in a very elegant and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Manner; by Means of his extraordinary Care, Diligence and Labour, through a Courſe of ſeveral Years: All which the ſaid Preſident has generouſly given for the Service of ſaid College.

            <p>The Building of this new Houſe was very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; for, after it was finiſhed, both Houſes would not contain all the Students, which were then in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber more than 170; ſo that more than 50 were obliged to live out of College.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Berkeley</hi> received Information from Time to Time, by Letters, and from Gentlemen who were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally here, concerning the Management and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his generous Donations; particularly from an Iriſh Gentleman, who was preſent at one of his Examinations, and carried to him two Calculations, made by his Scholars, viz. one of the Place of the Comet, at the Time of the Flood; which appeared Anno 1680, having a periodical Revolution of 575½ Years; which Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> ſuppoſes to have been the Cauſe of the Deluge.

And the Corporation being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to put the Lands under ſome profitable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, more eſpecially for maintaining a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of Divinity; the Preſident projected the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scheme, viz. that the Lands ſhould be leaſed for the Term of 999 Years; the Rent to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the preſent Value of the Lands, at 5 per <hi>Centum;</hi> to be forfeited in Caſe of non Payment of the Rent, at the annual Times appointed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable within Six Months after, upon Payment of the Rent, with lawful Intereſt upon it. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Leaſing appeared upon all Accounts, to be the moſt Advantageous both for Landlord and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The Rents were ſecured to the College in the beſt Manner, and they were free from the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Charge of Inſpection and Reparation. And the Tenants had all poſſible Encouragement to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate and improve the Lands, as their own. And the Rents were much higher than moſt other Lands were leaſed for, altho' cleared and fenced; tho' poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly in future Times they may ſeem low. Upon theſe Terms ſundry Parcels were leaſed out, from Time to Time, as there was opportunity.</p>

            <p>The College was in an agreeable and happy State, in moſt Reſpects, but had for many Years been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſome Difficulties and Diſadvantages with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Religion.

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:010262_0066_0F7E488A6C64BF00"/>
contrary to the Doctrines laid down in theſe Compoſures, we are of Opinion are wrong and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If any Doubt or Diſpute ſhould happen to ariſe about the true Meaning and Senſe of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Terms or Phraſes in the ſaid Compoſures, they ſhall be underſtood and taken in the ſame Senſe in which ſuch Terms and Phraſes have been generally uſed in the Writings of Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and eſpecially in their public Confeſſions of Faith.</p>
                        <p n="4">4.

                        <p n="8">8. That inaſmuch as it is eſpecially neceſſary, that a Profeſſor of Divinity ſhould be found in the Faith; beſides the common Teſts before mentioned, he ſhall publickly exhibit a full Confeſſion of his Faith, drawn up by him in his own Words and Phraſes, and ſhall in full and expreſs Terms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all ſuch Errors as ſhall in any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Meaſure prevail at the Time of his Introduction. And if any Doubt or Queſtion ſhould ariſe about any Doctrine or Poſition, whether it be Truth or Error, it ſhall be judged by the Word of God taken in that Senſe of it which is contained and declared in the ſaid Catechiſm and Confeſſion of Faith; as being a juſt Expoſition of the Word of God in thoſe Doctrines or Articles which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them.</p>

And
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:010262_0068_0F7E488BE1DD20E0"/>
it is eſpecially declared, that if any Perſon ſhall deny the Validity of the Ordination of the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Colony, commonly called <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> or <hi>Congregational,</hi> or ſhall hold, that it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or convenient that ſuch Miniſters ſhould be re-ordained, in order to render their Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>valid,</hi> it ſhall be deemed an eſſential Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from our eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution; and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Intentions of the Founders of this College, that ſuch a Perſon ſhould be choſen an Officer in it.</p>

            <p>The Preſident and Fellows met March 3, 1756,<note place="margin">1756</note> and ſpent a Day in examining Mr. <hi>Daggett,</hi> as to his Principles of Religion, his Knowledge and Skill in Divinity, Caſes of Conſcience, Scripture Hiſtory and Chronology, Antiquity, Skill in the Hebrew Tongue, and various other Qualifications for a Profeſſor; in all which he acquitted himſelf to the good Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Corporation. The next Day he preached a Sermon in the College-Hall, upon that Text, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> II. 2; and gave his full and explicit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all the Doctrines contained in our Catechiſm and Confeſſion of Faith, and to the Rules of Church Diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the Churches of this Colony. And alſo exhibited a full Confeſſion of his Faith, of his own Compoſure; and expreſsly renounced the principal Errors prevailing in theſe Times; according to the Act of the Corporation, before recited. Then he was by the Corporation, inaugurated and inſtalled <hi>Profeſſor of Divinity,</hi> in this College; with nearly the ſame Solemnities and Formalities, as are uſual at the Inſtalment of other Miniſters, who have been before ordained. All which are particularly entered in the Records of the College.</p>

            <p>At a Meeting of the Preſident and Fellows June 29, 1757. The Tutors and a Number of the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents made Application as follows, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <q>WHEREAS this Rev. Corporation of their paternal Care and Goodneſs, have ſettled a Profeſſor of Divinity in this Eccleſiaſtical Society, whom we
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010262_0072_0F7E4891477846F8"/>
receive as an able Miniſter of the New-Teſtament; We the Subſcribers, Members of this Society, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been admitted Members in full Communion in ſundry Churches, and conſenting to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conſtitution of the Churches of this Colony, as agreeable to the Word of God in Doctrine and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline; are deſirous to attend upon the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, under the Adminiſtration of the Rev. Profeſſor; and to walk together in ſtated Chriſtian Communion and holy Subjection to all the Ordinances of Chriſt; and deſire the Approbation and Sanction of this Rev. Body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was approved of by the Corporation; and a Sermon was preached in the Hall by the Profeſſor; and all proper Solemnities attended upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is accordingly adminiſtred in the College-Hall, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, on the firſt Lord's Day in each Month; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Practice of the Colleges in <hi>England.</hi> By all which the State and Conſtitution of the College was rendred more perfect and agreable; tho' not pleaſing to ſome particular Gentlemen of different Sentiments.</p>
            <p>In May 1763, nine Gentlemen preferred a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to the Honorable the General Aſſembly,<note place="margin">1763</note> wherein they repreſented, that the General Aſſembly were the <hi>Founders of the College;</hi> and as ſuch, had right to appoint <hi>Viſitors,</hi> to reform Abuſes if any were found. Which right the Memoraliſts ſuggeſted, ought to be ſeaſonably, and moſt explicitly vindicated and aſſerted: or otherwiſe the College might become too independent. And therefore prayed, that the ſaid Aſſembly, would paſs an Act, to authorize an Appeal, from any and every Sentence given by the Authority of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:010262_0073_0F7E48920E3FB098"/>
to the Governor and Council of this Colony; for the Time being. And that the ſaid Aſſembly would immediately iſſue forth a <hi>Commiſſion of Viſitation,</hi> enabling ſome ſuitable Perſons to inquire into all the Affairs of ſaid College, and either of themſelves rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify all Abuſes, which they may diſcover; or make Report of what they ſhall find, with their Opinions thereon, to the ſaid Aſſembly at their next Seſſion.</p>
            <p>The Counſel for the Memoraliſts alledged, that the General Aſſembly <hi>founded</hi> the College by giving a Charter, in the Year 1701: which contained a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of about Sixty Pounds Sterling, to be annually paid out of the publick Treaſury; and by ſundry ſubſequent Donations, eſpecially five Tracts of Land in the Year 1732. And that the preſent Aſſembly, as Succeſſors to the Founders, had a right of Viſitation, by the Common Law. They further alledged, that ſuch an Appeal, and Viſitation were very neceſſary to preſerve the good Order and Regulation of the College, upon all Accounts, and particularly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> in Religion.</p>
            <p>To which the Preſident replied;</p>
            <p>That the General Aſſembly, in their Legiſlative Capacity, have the ſame Authority over the College, and all the Perſons and Eſtates belonging to it; as they have over all other Perſons and Eſtates in the Colony; and all that Power which is neceſſary for the good of the College, or the general Good of the Community. And that an eſpecial Reſpect and Gratitude is due to them, as the <hi>greateſt Benefactors;</hi> yet they are not to be conſidered as <hi>Founders</hi> or <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> in the Senſe of the Common Law. That the <hi>first</hi> Truſtees, Undertakers and Inſpectors, who were nominated by the Miniſters with the general Conſent of the People, and by Compact, became a Society or

               <hi>Quaſi Corporation</hi> (as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays) near two Years before they had a Charter, were the <hi>Founders</hi> of the College; and that they formed it, by making a large and formal Donation of Books; above a Year before they had a Charter from the Government. That the College had a Being, not only in <hi>fieri</hi> in the Purpoſe and Intention of the Undertakers (as Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays) <note n="*" place="bottom">Coke 10 <hi>Rep.</hi>
               </note> but in <hi>eſſe</hi> by the Donation of Books, Money and Land actually made to it, before it <hi>had a Charter. That</hi> Major <hi>Fitch</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> made a Donation, in Writing, to the Undertakers, of Six Hundred Acres of Land, and ſome Materials to build a College Houſe, in the Time of the ſitting of the Aſſembly, ſome Days before the Charter was given. And this Donation he made to the Collegiate School, as <q>
                  <hi>already ſet up by the great Pains and Charges of the Miniſters.</hi>
               </q> That the King, by giving a Licence to found a College, does not thereby, in Law, become the Founder <hi>in Senſu Dotationis.</hi> And that he is the Founder only of thoſe Colleges or Hoſpitals, to which he makes the <hi>firſt</hi> Donation for founding. My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> diſtinguiſhes between <hi>Fundator Incipiens</hi> and <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dator Perficiens;</hi> and ſays, that he only is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>quoad Dotationem,</hi> (to whoſe Heirs or Succeſſors the Law gives a Right of <hi>Viſitation</hi>) who makes the FIRST DONATION. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Coke 10 <hi>Reports.</hi>
               </note> And the Right of Viſitation ariſes in Law, from the Intereſt which the Founder has in the College or Hoſpital by his Donation.</p>
            <p>For if it be eſſentially perverted from the Deſign for which it was given, the Donation becomes void, and reverts to the Donor or his Heirs. That the firſt Donation <hi>only</hi> creates the <hi>Founder;</hi> and all ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Donations are preſumed in Law to be given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:010262_0075_0F7E489364AC84F0"/>
the ſame End and Deſign with the firſt, unleſs ſome particular Limitation be expreſsly made.</p>
            <p>That if a common Perſon makes a Donation to found a College or Hoſpital, tho' ever ſo ſmall, and the King afterwards endows it with large Poſſeſſions, yet the common Perſon is the Founder and not the King. <note n="†" place="bottom">Wood's <hi>Inſtitutes.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>That a <hi>Licence</hi> to found, and a <hi>Charter</hi> of Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, are in their own Nature diſtinct; and either may be firſt, in Law, yet they are often Times both contained in the ſame Inſtrument; and may either preceed or ſucceed the firſt fundamental Donation.</p>
            <p>When the fundamental Donation is made before the Licence to found, there the Licence is only a formal and explicit Confirmation from the Crown, of what was before done by the general Licence given by the Common and Statute Law; whereby every Man may give his Eſtate, for publick, pious and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Uſes; upon ſuch Conditions and Regulations, as he ſhall ſee Cauſe. <note n="‖" place="bottom">See <hi>39</hi> Eliz. C. <hi>5,</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> Laws.</note> And the Feoffees in truſt, are the legal Proprietors of ſuch Donations; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Conditions and Limitations with which they are made. And have a legal Right to hold and leaſe; and to diſpoſe of the Profits as a <hi>quaſi Corporation,</hi> for thoſe particular Purpoſes. And may, by a long Courſe of ſtated and regular Conduct, become a <hi>complete</hi> legal Corporation, by <hi>Preſcription.</hi> And the King's Charter or Licence only makes or declares that to be a legal Corporation, <hi>at the first,</hi> which may become ſuch, by <hi>immemorial Uſage</hi> and Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>In a Licence to found, the Words FOUND, ERECT or any other Words of the like Import, are indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:010262_0076_0F7E48946FF392E0"/>
in Law; and ſufficient to make a Foundation; And in the firſt Charter or Grant to the College, theſe Words are promiſcuouſly uſed, and applied to the <hi>first Truſtees only.</hi> The firſt Charter plainly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes ten Truſtees, Partners or Undertakers <hi>antecedently</hi> exiſting; and a School <hi>already founded, in fact,</hi> (tho' not <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>completely</hi> ſo in <hi>Law</hi>) by Donation of Lands, Goods, and Monies, <hi>before given;</hi> and therefore gives them a <hi>full</hi> legal Right, Liberty and Privilege to proceed, in erecting, endowing and governing the School; which they had a general and imperfect Right to do by the Common Law. And the Charter declares them to be in a legal Capacity to <q>demand, have, hold, and poſſeſs all ſuch Lands, Goods and Monies as have <hi>heretofore</hi> been given, (as well as thoſe which might hereafter be given) for the founding, erecting and endowing the ſaid School.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And there is no Intimation, that their giving to the firſt Truſtees, a Right to receive Sixty Pounds out of the publick Treaſury, a Year after, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and to improve it, at their Diſcretion, for the Good of the School, ſhould be deemed the <hi>ſounding</hi> of it; to be ſure not in ſuch a Senſe as to annul the former Foundation; much leſs could any Endowments made thirty Years after, make them the Founders in the Senſe of the Common Law. Beſides the Preamble to the Charter of 1745, expreſsly ſays, that the firſt Truſtees <hi>founded</hi> the College.</p>
            <p>It was further obſerved, that an <q>Appeal from all and every Sentence given by the Authority of College; to the Governor and Council of this Colony, for the Time being,</q> (as propoſed in the Memorial,) would retard and obſtruct all the Proceedings of the Authority of College. It being found, by univerſal Experience, that in all Inſtances, wherein a Liberty
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:010262_0077_0F7E4894E0E97210"/>
of Appeal is allowed, the Judgment appealed from, is of no Force or Efficacy; except that which may ariſe from the extraordinary Trouble and Charge of bringing the Caſe to a Trial, in the Court ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to. That ſuch a Conſtitution would take the Government of the College wholly out of the Hands of thoſe, in whom it was originally veſted; and be contrary to the Charter. That ſuch a univerſal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Appeals, eſpecially in criminal Caſes, is not allowed in any Community whatſoever; and that thoſe few Caſes in which Appeals are allowed in ſome other Colleges, are under peculiar Conditions and Reſtrictions.</p>
            <p>It was alſo obſerved that the Power of <hi>Viſitation</hi> is, by the Common Law, expreſsly limited to the <hi>Statutes of the Founder;</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Raymond</hi>'s Reports, Vol. I. P. <hi>7.</hi>
               </note> which are the Conditions or Limitations of the Uſe of the Founder's Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the Viſitor can do nothing but rectify thoſe Things which are plainly repugnant to thoſe Limitations; or claim a Forfeiture. But as no ſuch Statutes, made by the General Aſſembly, can be found; ſuch Viſitors would have no Power at all, or be altogether arbitrary, like the Viſitors ſent to <hi>Magdalen</hi> College, by King <hi>James</hi> II.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that there is any Need of any Overſeers, under the Name and Title of <hi>Viſitors;</hi> the firſt Truſtees and their Succeſſors, may properly be denominated ſuch: And in the firſt Plan of the College, they are expreſsly called <hi>Inſpectors.</hi> That to have Viſitors over Viſitors or Inſpectors, would make endleſs Trouble and Confuſion. That Matters of Property muſt be determined by the ſtated, execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Courts, according to the Courſe of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:010262_0078_0F7E48987471C418"/>
Law; but to erect any new Kind of Court over the Affairs of the College, which are committed to the Preſident and Fellows, would be an Infringement on their Charter. Though the General Aſſembly ſtill retain ſuch a ſupreme Power, as that if there ſhould be any plain <hi>Breach of Truſt,</hi> cognizable by a <hi>Court of Chancery,</hi> or any ſuch Miſconduct in the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as ſhould be plainly detrimental to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, they may rectify it in their legiſlative Capacity.</p>
            <p>As to the Advantage of Viſitors to preſerve <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy</hi> in the Governors of the College;</p>
            <p>The Preſident obſerved, that whatever was the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, or Deſign of that Argument, he was glad that ſuch an important Point was moved. That it was well known, that the Preſident and Fellows or Truſtees have from the Beginning, ſhewn a proper Care and Zeal to preſerve Orthodoxy in all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the College; and to ſuch a Degree, as to be diſagreable to ſome Gentlemen of late; who have thereupon endeavoured to obſtruct the Government, and flouriſhing State of the College. That the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy of the College was ſettled and ſecured upon the beſt Foundation, that human Wiſdom, directed by the general Rules of God's Word, could deviſe. That according to the original Deſign of the Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the College, the Preſident, Fellows, Profeſſor of Divinity, and Tutors, are to be admitted upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their Conſent to the <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> agreed upon by the Churches in the Colony, Anno 1708, and eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Government. <note n="¶" place="bottom">See Anno <hi>1753.</hi>

               </note> And as the Governors of the College are ſatisfied that the Body of this Honorable Aſſembly is fully orthodox, and ſo are intirely eaſy under their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendency; relying principally upon the Care of the great Head of Church; yet they can't have the like Security of any other Order of Men, which may be ſubſtituted by them. And one principal Reaſon why they oppoſe all <hi>Innovations</hi> in the Conſtitution and Government of the College, is, leſt they might hereafter, have an ill Influence upon the Orthodoxy of it; which the Preſident and Fellows, according to the Truſt repoſed in them, by the Founders and by the General Aſſembly, are fully determined to maintain and preſerve to the Utmoſt of their Power.</p>
            <p>When theſe Arguments were conſidered by the Honorable the General Aſſembly, but very few ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be of the Opinion, that the Aſſembly
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:010262_0080_0F7E48999229FE70"/>
were the <hi>Founders</hi> of the College; and ſo they acted nothing upon the Memorial. And it is generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that this Queſtion will never be publickly moved again.</p>
            <p>The Rev. Mr. <hi>Jared Eliot,</hi> of <hi>Killingworth,</hi> in his laſt Will, gave Seven Pounds and Ten Shillings, Ster. to be put out to Intereſt; and the Intereſt thereof to be expended in purchaſing Books for the Library from Time to Time, at the Diſcretion of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident and Fellows.</p>
            <p>The Number of Students, for near ten Years paſt being about 170, it became extremely inconvenient to carry on all religious and ſcholaſtick Exerciſes in the old <hi>College-Hall;</hi> and to make Uſe of it for a Dining-Room.</p>
            <p>The Library was alſo too ſmall for the Books and Apparatus. The Preſident therefore propoſed a Scheme to build a new <hi>Hall</hi> or <hi>Chapel,</hi> with a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary over it: And ſet forward a Subſcription for that Purpoſe: the Foundation was laid in April 1761, and the Outſide was nearly finiſhed that Summer: It is built of Brick, fifty Feet long, and forty Feet wide, with a Steeple and Galleries, in which are three Roſtra for Orations, Diſputations, &amp;c. and a Library over the whole. It is ſet near the South End of the Brick College, with a View that when another Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege is built, it will be ſet near the South Side of the Chapel. In June 1763, it was opened with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon preached by the Profeſſor, in the Preſence of the Preſident and Fellows, and a large Number of other Gentlemen. And the Preſident and Fellows voted, <q>that the <hi>Chapel</hi> ſhould hereafter be uſed for the Religious and Scholaſtick Meetings and Exerciſes,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010262_0081_0F7E489A25DB8F10"/>
for which the old <hi>College-Hall</hi> has been uſed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore.</q>
The Conveniencies of it have been found to be very many and great.</p>

               <hi>AN APPENDIX,</hi> Containing the preſent State of the College; the Method of Inſtruction and Government; and a Liſt of Officers, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors and Graduates.</head>
            <p>THIS College is under the Government of a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ten Fellows; who are ſome of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Miniſters, in the ſeveral Parts of the Colony: And ordinarily meet on the ſecond Wedneſday in September, annually, and on ſpecial Emergencies; to confer Degrees, ſettle the College Accounts, appoint ſubordinate Officers, make Laws, and direct in the general and more important Affairs of the College.</p>
            <p>The Preſident has the principal Care and Buſineſs of inſtructing and governing the Students; with the Aſſiſtance of a Profeſſor of Divinity, and three Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The Preſident every Morning and Evening, reads and expounds a Chapter in the Bible, and prays in the Chapel; at which all the Students are obliged to attend. After Evening Prayers, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently makes Diſſertations upon various Subjects in Religion and Learning, and almoſt all the different Affairs and Employments of Life.</p>
            <p>The Profeſſor of Divinity preaches Sermons in the Chapel, every Lord's-Day, in the Courſe of a Body of Divinity, Doctrinal and Practical; and occaſional
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:010262_0084_0F7E489C63331FA8"/>
Diſcourſes or Lectures, at other Times; and frequently gives private Counſel and Inſtruction.</p>
            <p>The Number of undergraduate Students, for many Years paſt, has been about One Hundred and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty; but by Reaſon of the diſtreſſing Difficulties which the Country has been under, of late, the Number has been diminiſhed, for two or three Years paſt. They are divided into four Claſſes; according to the reſpective Years, in which they were admitted. Each Claſs is under the immediate Inſtruction of a particular Tutor; who carries them thro' a Courſe of Studies, for three Years; and the Preſident com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletes their Inſtruction in the fourth. At their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion they are able well to conſtrue and parſe <hi>Tully</hi>'s Orations, <hi>Virgil</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi> Teſtament; and underſtand the Rules of common Arithmetick. In the firſt Year, they learn <hi>Hebrew;</hi> and principally purſue the Study of the Languages, and make a Beginning in Logick, and ſome Parts of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks. In the ſecond Year, they ſtudy the Languages; but principally recite Logick, Rhetorick, Oratory, Geography and natural Philoſophy: And ſome of them make good Proficiency in Trigono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and Algebra. In the third Year, they ſtill purſue the Study of natural Philoſophy; and moſt Branches of the Mathematicks: Many of them well underſtand Surveying, Navigation and the Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eclipſes; and ſome of them are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Proficients in Conic Sections and Fluxions. In the fourth Year they principally ſtudy and recite Metaphyſicks, Ethicks and Divinity. In reciting any Book upon the Arts and Sciences, the Tutor aſks them Queſtions upon all the principal Points and Propoſitions in it; and they give ſuch Anſwers, as ſhew whether they underſtand it; and the Tutor
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:010262_0085_0F7E489D4D0B0128"/>
explains it, as far as there is Occaſion. In all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineations and Calculations, a ſelect Number, with proper Inſtruments in their Hands, are inſtructed at a Table.</p>
            <p>The two upper Claſſes exerciſe their Powers in diſputing every Monday in the Syllogiſtick Form, and every Tueſday in the Forenſick; which gives a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Scope to their Genius, and is better adapted to the common Uſe and Practice of Mankind, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of publick Affairs. In theſe Diſputes we often hear a Summary of the beſt Arguments which can be produced out of any Author, on both Sides of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Queſtion.</p>
            <p>When they have alternately gone through all their Arguments, the Moderator recapitulates thoſe which ſeem to be the moſt plauſible on each Side, ſhews their real Force or Weakneſs, and gives his Opinion upon the Whole. The Queſtions are taken from every Subject, which occurs in the whole Circle of Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and upon almoſt all the doubtful Points, which have been publickly diſputed among Mankind.</p>
            <p>Twice a Week five or ſix deliver a Declamation memoriter from the oratorical Roſtrum; the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent makes ſome Obſervations upon the Manner of Delivery and ſometimes upon the Subject; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gives ſome ſmall Laurel to him who beſt acts the Part of an Orator. Theſe Declamations are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand ſuperviſed by their Tutor, who corrects the Othography and Punctuation. There are alſo two Orations made every Quarter-Day, upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and frequently on ſpecial Occaſions. And to train them up to an agreable Stile and Method of Writing, the Preſident directs them, that when any one has Buſineſs of ſpecial Importance with him, they ſhould make Application in the Form of a Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:010262_0086_0F7E48A0A04955C8"/>Special Care is taken to form the Morals of the Youth; to keep them (as much as may be) from all Exceſſes and Extravagancies; from all vain Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectations of Show, which occaſion unneceſſary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and divert their Minds from the Purſuit of thoſe Things which are of greater Importance; to inſtil into their Minds true Notions of Honor, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, and a Love of Virtue: And to impreſs upon them a Senſe, that the End of their Creation, and of all their ſpecial Advantages, is not ultimately for themſelves, or their own Sakes; but to qualify them for the ſpecial Service of God; and to render them moſt uſeful to their Fellow-Men.</p>
            <p>Above all, Care is taken to inſtil into their Minds, the Principles of true Religion, in Doctrine and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, by publick and private Diſcourſes and perſonal Converſations. To this End they are obliged to attend the publick Worſhip of God in the Chapel every Lord's-Day, and Morning and Evening Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; at which, Occaſion is frequently taken, from the Portion of Scripture read, to excite them to ſome particular Duty, and to Caution them againſt ſome particular Sin.</p>
            <p>The Sons of thoſe, who proſeſs themſelves to be Epiſcopalians, have Liberty to go out on the Lord's-Day, and at other Times, to attend on the Mode of Worſhip in which they were educated, as often as will not be an Infraction on the general Rules of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the College. Perſons of all Denominations of Proteſtants are allowed the Advantage of an Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, and no Inquiry has been made, at their Admiſſion or afterwards, about their particular Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in Religion. Yet, if it ſhould manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that any ſhould take Pains to infect the Minds of their Fellow-Students with ſuch pernicious Errors,

as are contrary to the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and the ſpecial Deſign of founding this College, ſo that Parents ſhould juſtly be afraid of venturing their Children here, it is probable that ſome Notice would be taken of it. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Act of the Truſtees <hi>1722,</hi> and the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>The principal Deſign of the Inſtitution of this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, was to educate Perſons for the Work of the Miniſtry; which Deſign has been ſo far ſucceeded as that above Four Hundred worthy Miniſters have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Education here, of which 40 have been epiſcopally ordained, and four of them have been judged qualified for the Degree of <hi>Doctor of Divinity,</hi> by the Univerſities in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> Yet inaſmuch as more have been educated, than are neceſſary for the immediate Service of the Churches, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for various other publick and important Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in civil Life; the Preſident therefore frequently makes publick Diſſertations upon every Subjects neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be underſtood, to qualify young Gentlemen for thoſe various Stations and Employments; ſuch as the Nature of civil Government, the civil Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> the various Kinds of Courts, and Officers ſuperior and inferior, the ſeveral Kinds of Laws by which the Kingdom is governed; as the Statute, Common, Civil, Canon, Military and Maritime Laws; together with their ſeveral various Origins and Extents; the ſeveral Forms of Eccleſiaſtical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which have obtained in the Chriſtian Church; ancient Hiſtory and Chronology, the Nature and Form of obligatory Writings and Inſtruments, Agriculture, Commerce, Navigation, with ſome general Sketches upon Phyſick, Anatomy, Heraldry and Gunnery, ſo
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:010262_0088_0F7E48A2CF869818"/>
far as it falls under the Rules of Philoſophy and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks; that ſo every one educated here might have, at leaſt, a general and ſuperficial Knowledge of every important Affair of Life; and be directed to thoſe Books which may give him a more complete Knowledge of that particular Art and Science, which may be moſt agreable to his own Genius or Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Almoſt all the Students reſide in the College, and are boarded by the Steward in the Hall, after the Manner of common Families without any Reſtriction of Weight or Meaſure; for which they pay 4<abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>

                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> per Week Sterling. This Proviſion is generally agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo that the Tutors always, the Preſident fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Fellows, and many other Gentlemen, occaſionally are entertained with it.</p>
            <p>The undergraduate Students alſo pay for Tuition and Inſtruction 9 Shillings, for the Rent of their Chambers and Studies 1<abbr>

               </abbr> for Repairs and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Charges One Shilling Sterling, per Quarter: Which Sums are collected by the Steward, and paid out by Order from the Preſident and Fellows. After the neceſſary incident Charges are deducted, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue is applied for the Payment of the Salaries of the Officers, which of late Years have been to the Preſident £. 110, to each of the three Tutors £. 43, and to the Senior Tutor, who is Keeper of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, £. 6 Sterling more. Altho' thoſe Salaries are ſcanty enough, yet inaſmuch as the Incomes are now leſſened by Reaſon of the Poverty of the Country, and the Diminution of the Number of Students, it is feared, that either the Salaries, or the Number of the Officers muſt be diminiſhed, either of which will be inconvenient.</p>
            <p>In the Exerciſe of Diſcipline, Care is taken to impreſs the Minds of the Students with a Senſe of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:010262_0089_0F7E48A33208AF70"/>
the Amiableneſs of Virtue and the odious Nature of all Vice and Diſorder, and the Reaſonableneſs of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving all the Laws and Orders of the Society, from a Principle of Choice, Virtue and Honor. In thoſe Inſtances where theſe Motives have not their deſired Influence, and any are guilty of Miſdemeanors of a leſſer Kind, they are reprimanded, or puniſhed with ſome ſmall Fine, as a Prelude or Earneſt of a greater Puniſhment, if they perſiſt in doing the like: If they do perſiſt, and are guilty of ſome greater Crime, they are publickly admoniſhed or ruſticated, for ſome Months. If they are guilty of an habitual Courſe of Idleneſs and Negligence in their Studies and Attendance on Prayers and Recitations; or if they are guilty of a Courſe of any conſiderable Crimes, after leſſer Puniſhments, they are ruſticated for a Year, and put back in the next Claſs, or wholly diſmiſſed from being Members of College. And if they are guilty of groſs Immoralities, or any Crimes of a hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and atrocious Nature, deſtructive to the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, they are expelled. When any of theſe greater Puniſhments are publickly inflicted upon any, the Preſident makes a ſolemn Addreſs to the Reſt, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon their Minds a Senſe of the evil Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Conſequence of ſuch <hi>Crimes,</hi> and to perſuade them to take Warning not to do the like.</p>
            <p>We have a good Library, conſiſting of about 4000 Volumes, well furniſhed with ancient Authors; ſuch as the Fathers, Hiſtorians, and Claſſicks, many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern valuable Books of Divinity, Hiſtory, Philoſophy, and Mathematicks, but not many Authors who have wrote within theſe 30 Years.—We have a good Air-Pump, Set of Globes, Teleſcope, ſmall Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical Quadrant, Microſcope, Thermometer, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odolite,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:010262_0090_0F7E48A3E1D06710"/>
and an electrical Machine: but no other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus, of any great Conſequence.</p>
            <p>The Students enjoy all neceſſary Means of Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and are under the Advantage of geting all that valuable and uſeful Knowledge, which they can, or will acquire in the Space of four Years.</p>
            <p>In order to diſcover their Proficiency, and to excite them to a laudable Ambition to excel, there is a publick Examination of each Claſs, about once a Quarter; with Orations or Speeches pertinent to the Occaſion. In July, annually, there is a formal Examination of the Candidates for the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, in the Languages, Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and in the whole Circle of Academical Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature: which is carried on publickly in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by the Tutors and any other Gentlemen, of a liberal Education, who ſee cauſe to join with them. After Examination, the Candidates are ſeverally put to Vote, by the Moderator, whether they are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for a Degree? And they accordingly return a formal Certificate to the Preſident. In ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Compaſſion has had a great Influence. On this Occaſion, ſeveral pertinent Speeches are made, in Latin, by the Preſident and Tutors; and two publick Orations, by the Candidates: the one to give a Specimen of their Knowledge in the ſeveral Branches of Academical Literature: and the other to give a grateful and pathetick Valediction to all the Officers and Members of the Society. The Law obliges all the Candidates for the Degree of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Arts to attend before the Commencement, and give ſome Specimen of their Proficiency in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: but this has been two generally diſpenſed with.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:010262_0091_0F7E48A5101EF018"/>The publick Commencement is ordinarily on the ſecond Wedneſday in September annually: at which there is a large Aſſembly, conſiſting of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Fellows, a great Number of Miniſters, and other learned and ſuperior Gentlemen. The Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent begins the Solemnity with Prayer, one of the Candidates, for the firſt Degree, makes a ſalutatory Oration to the Governor and Council, the Officers of College, and the whole Aſſembly: the others give a Specimen of their Learning, by diſputing Syllogiſtically on the Queſtions, printed in their The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; which are then diſtributed. The like is done in the Afternoon by the Candidates for the Degree of Maſter of Arts. Then the Preſident, with the Conſent of the Fellows, gives them their Degrees, three at a Time, in this Form:</p>
            <p>PRO Auctoritate mihi commiſſa, admitto vos ad Primum Gradum in artibus; pro More Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum in Anglia. Vobiſque trado hunc Librum, una cum Poteſtate publice Praelegendi, quotieſcunque ad iſthoc Munus evocati fueritis: cujus, haec in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumenta, <note n="*" place="bottom">The Preſident delivers to each of them a <hi>Diploma.</hi>
               </note> membrano ſcripta, Teſtimonio ſint.</p>
            <p>The like Form is uſed for the <hi>Masters,</hi> only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Primum,</hi> it is, <hi>Secundum:</hi> and inſtead of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legendi,</hi> it is, <hi>Profitendi;</hi> and ſometimes, inſtead of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum,</hi> the Preſident ſays, <hi>Gradum Baccalaureatus;</hi> and inſtead of <hi>Secundum,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Gradum Magiſtralem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then one of the Maſters makes a Valedictory Oration: and the Preſident concludes the whole Solemnity with a Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:010262_0092_0F7E48A5957FA980"/>The Proficiency made by the Students is various; according to their different Genius and Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: a Number in each Claſs are generally finiſhed Scholars in the Languages, and the liberal Arts and Sciences: and if they were dignified with ſome kind of peculiar Laurel, it might be an additional Stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus:<note n="*" place="bottom">It is alſo true, that ſome who have been educated and graduated here, have, by their Conduct, been no Honour to the Society: and ſince the Honour of every Degree, Title, or Office, will finally be to each Individual, according to the real Merit of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of thoſe in the ſame Order; and every Inſtance of Honour, conferred upon an unworthy Subject, is eventually, at the Expence of thoſe who are worthy; it is greatly to be deſired, that more equal Juſtice ſhould be done in that Reſpect.</note> but their ſuperior Qualifications are ſoon known to the World; and they, in a little Time, make a uſeful Figure in Church or State. Moſt of our ſuperior Gentlemen, who have ſhined brighteſt at the Council Board, on the Bench, at the Bar, or in the Army, have had their Education in this Society. And ſome of them, of late Years have applied the Principles of Mechanical and Experimental Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, to the Improvement of Agriculture; and have been able to inſtruct their Neighbours in that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for the publick Good.</p>
