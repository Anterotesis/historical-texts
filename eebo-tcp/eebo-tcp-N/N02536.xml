            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An <hi>Argument</hi> for AND <hi>Perſuaſive</hi> unto the great and important Duty OF <hi>FAMILY WORSHIP.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT having been no ſmall part of the Honour and Glory of my <hi>Country,</hi> from the beginning of it, that it has been famous for the practice of FAMILY WORSHIP, to which under the Grace and Bleſſing of GOD the <hi>Virtue, Religion</hi> and <hi>Proſperity</hi> of it muſt be (if I judge right) very much attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I am therefore moved and inclined to look over the <hi>Arguments</hi> &amp; <hi>Motives</hi> unto, and the <hi>Reaſons</hi> for this great and important <hi>Duty,</hi> and leave them (as they have occurr'd to me) with the Children of my People, that this GLORY <hi>may ſtill dwell in our Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Method,</hi> in which I ſhall diſpoſe my Tho'ts on this <hi>Argument,</hi> ſhall be this:
<list>
                  <item>1. To ſay what I mean by FAMILY WORSHIP:</item>
                  <item>2. To prove it to be a Duty, and ſhow our <hi>Obligations</hi> to obſerve it.</item>
                  <item>3. To
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003008_0003_0FEF9C89024C3608"/>lay down <hi>Rules</hi> for the due Performance of it. And</item>
                  <item>4. To urge the Duty with ſome proper <hi>Motives.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. By FAMILY WORSHIP I mean, That ſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Order,</hi> and Uſage in a <hi>Houſhold,</hi> wherein the <hi>Head</hi> of the Houſe doth ordinarily every Day, at ſtated and appointed Times, call the <hi>Family</hi> together for the performance of ſuch <hi>holy Exerciſes,</hi> as are proper to them in their worſhipping GOD together.</p>
            <p>This is a diſtinct kind of Worſhip from <hi>ſolitary</hi> and <hi>ſecret,</hi> which is a Perſons retiring by himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (into his <hi>Cloſet,</hi> Matth. vi. 6.) to meditate, read, pray to and praiſe GOD. It is alſo a diſtinct thing from <hi>public</hi> Worſhip, in Church Aſſemblies and Congregations, for the Adminiſtration of Inſtituted Ordinances. So likewiſe it is diverſe from the <hi>private Meetings</hi> of religious People at one anothers Houſes, occaſionally to pray together and hear the Word.</p>
            <p>There are parts of <hi>Inſtituted</hi> Worſhip, that do by no means belong to Family Worſhip. GOD never meant the <hi>Sacraments of the New Teſtament</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by Maſters of Families in their houſes. Theſe belong to the public Miniſtry of Religion in the Churches of CHRIST. And excepting Caſes of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> or in times of <hi>perſecution,</hi> there can be no pretence for the Adminiſtration of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> or the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> in private Houſes. And then the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration ſhould be by a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of CHRIST, and to more than a private houſhold. Wherefore Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Adminiſtrations are no part of <hi>Family Worſhip.</hi> — Nor is there any Argument from the Sacraments of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> to thoſe of the <hi>New. Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> and the <hi>Paſſover</hi> were in their Inſtitution a kind of Family Ordinances; but ſo were not the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of CHRIST and his <hi>Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only the Exerciſes and Duties of <hi>natural Worſhip</hi> are proper to Families, as ſuch. Natural Worſhip is
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003008_0004_0FEF9C8E8DD9A398"/>that which the Conſideration of the Being and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of GOD dictate to the Reaſon and Conſcience of Man. <hi>This</hi> alſo belongs both to public and ſecret Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prayer and Praiſe;</hi> Adoration and Thankſgiving; Confeſſion, Supplications and Interceſſion; are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and neceſſary parts of Family Worſhip. So is <hi>reading the Word</hi> of GOD to our Houſholds<note n="‖" place="bottom">Deut. vi. 6, 7. 1 Tim. iv. 5.</note>. Alſo the <hi>ſinging of Pſalms</hi>

Theſe are the principal religious <hi>Exerciſes,</hi> that do properly belong to the Worſhip of GOD in our Houſes.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Now to ſhew our <hi>Obligation</hi> thus to worſhip GOD with our Houſholds, I ſhall argue
<list>
                  <item>1. from the light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and natural Conſcience,</item>
                  <item>2. from <hi>Scripture</hi> Revelations.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the light of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is indeed very <hi>hard,</hi> for us who enjoy the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to ſay, What the bare light of Nature and Reaſon, in this our <hi>fallen</hi> ſtate would teach us. We are ſo <hi>alienated from the Life of God thro' the Ignorance that is in us, by reaſon of the Blindneſs of our hearts,</hi> that probably no one of us would have had a tho't of worſhiping GOD with our Families, had we been born and bred <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Salvages.</hi> But yet I am confident, that <hi>Reaſon</hi> duely exerciſed, and natural <hi>Conſcience</hi> hearkned to thereupon, would ſoon lead and bring Men to worſhip GOD both in ſecret and with their Families. At leaſt <hi>our</hi> Reaſon under the common Illuminations of <hi>Scripture,</hi> is fruitful of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for ſo plain a Duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003008_0005_0FEF9C90505E8188"/>
The light of <hi>Nature</hi> teaches us that there is a GOD, and that he ought to be <hi>worſhip'd</hi> by us, and if ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>apart</hi> by our ſelves, why not <hi>ſocially</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? And if ſocially, why not in <hi>Families,</hi> which are diſtinct Societies? And why not <hi>firſtly</hi> in Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which are the <hi>firſt</hi> Societies that Mankind came and comes into? For Families are the <hi>Original</hi> of all Societies, and conſequently the firſt ſocial Worſhip was of neceſſity in a Family. This is plain and eaſy Reaſoning, level to the Capacity of every Child: But how ſtrongly and irreſiſtibly doth it conclude for the Worſhip of GOD in <hi>Families?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To let in a gleam of <hi>Revelation</hi> here: Who but GOD is the <hi>Inſtitutor</hi> and Founder of Families? He made at firſt but <hi>one Pair;</hi> He put them together and bleſſed them. He could have made <hi>many</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies at once, plac'd them together, and ordain'd the firſt Act of Worſhip to have been from an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of men. But it pleaſed <hi>the</hi> GOD <hi>of the Spirits of all Fleſh</hi> to make at firſt <hi>one</hi> only Family out of which all the Families of the Earth have ſprang. And why did He this? ſeeing <hi>He had the reſidue of the Spirit,</hi> and could as eaſily have made a million Families at once? Why may I not be allow'd to ſay — <hi>That He might ſeek</hi> a godly Family, a religious Houſhold! that this might be his <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> from the Earth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men! that Families might be <hi>ſanctified</hi> unto Him for ever, by the rendring of the <hi>firſt</hi> ſocial Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in them; and that this ſacred <hi>Dignity</hi> might be put and entail'd upon Houſholds, that for the firſt <hi>Ages</hi> of the World the <hi>whole</hi> Worſhip of GOD was in them. And ſhould not his ſolemn Worſhip continue in them to the <hi>End</hi> of the World?</p>
            <p>All the Nations of the Earth own that Families are <hi>diſtinct Societies,</hi> and that they have a <hi>Government</hi> of their own; Laws and Rules proper and peculiar to themſelves, for their own weal and good Order.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003008_0006_0FEF9C93C7F46468"/>Witneſs the famous LAW of King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> directed <hi>to every People after their Language,</hi> both to <hi>great and ſmall, That every Man ſhall bear Rule in his own Houſe.</hi> Eſther i. ult. Say then, ſhall he not rule for GOD? and acknowledge HIM in his Houſe with conſtant dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Devotions? Shall theſe primary, neceſſary, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, perpetual Societies of Men be without the Adoration, Confeſſion and Praiſes of GOD in them? Has the great GOD nothing to do with theſe Societies, nor they with Him? No? tho' He be the Author, Preſerver, Feeder and daily Benefactor of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? the <hi>Health</hi> of it, and its GOD? Is not the Family what it is by his Providence? can it ſubſiſt a day without Him? And yet no Worſhip of GOD in it from day to day! no <hi>Prayer?</hi> as if it had no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on Him! Does it indeed <hi>want</hi> no Benefit or Bleſſing from Him? nor <hi>expect</hi> any? that it craves none! And does it <hi>receive</hi> none from day to day? that there are no daily Offerings of <hi>Praiſe</hi> in the Houſe! Or does GOD indeed keep and feed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily from year to year; and has He no <hi>Altar,</hi> no <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in it? but the doors of the Houſe are ſhut againſt Him! He ſhut <hi>out</hi> of it! This profaneſs, this <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is implied in the want of Family Worſhip; in defiance to Reaſon and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, Can a Society be more <hi>adapted</hi> and <hi>engaged</hi> to worſhip together daily, than a Family is? Is any other Society framed and <hi>formed</hi> like <hi>this</hi> for daily worſhip? living together under one <hi>Roof,</hi> and united in mutual and near <hi>Relations</hi> to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! and tied together by thoſe bonds of Love and Endearment, which ſhould bind them to GOD, whoſe <hi>all Souls are,</hi> the Souls of Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants! — O with what a ſacred <hi>Pleaſure</hi> ſhould a Man call the Family of his Love together, to worſhip GOD? Can he own a GOD, and love his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and not love to pray with them and for them?
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003008_0007_0FEF9C99DC582A20"/>Doth not even <hi>Nature</hi> teach this? — Methinks he muſt be willingly ignorant, who queſtions it, <hi>not lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to retain</hi> GOD <hi>in his knowledge;</hi> his Diſaffection to his MAKER (horrible to ſpeak) overthrowing even his natural Affection to his <hi>Family!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Let Nature and Reaſon judge of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Need</hi> and <hi>Occaſion</hi> of Worſhip in our Families. Are there no Family <hi>Mercies</hi> daily wanted, which GOD only can give? nor any received from Him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Morning and Evening, for which Thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought openly to be render'd? And are there not ſometimes Family <hi>Sins,</hi> for which the Houſhold have reaſon to <hi>humble</hi> themſelves together before GOD?

For tho' they <hi>chang'd the Truth of</hi> GOD <hi>into a lye,</hi> yet their Conſciences <hi>bare a Witneſs</hi> to the Truth before us, and ſhew'd the <hi>Work of the Law written in their Hearts.</hi> How <hi>vain</hi> ſoever theſe their <hi>Imaginations</hi> were, and how groſsly ſoever <hi>their fooliſh heart was darkned;</hi> yet their <hi>Houſhold Idolatries</hi> may riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the more profane <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But I come to argue from <hi>Scripture</hi> and reveal'd Religion.

This being promis'd, I ſhall now gather up ſome of the <hi>Notices</hi> and Intimations of the Mind of GOD from his <hi>Word</hi> about Family Worſhip; amounting to a plain <hi>Revelation</hi> of his Will in the matter; and then go over ſome Scripture <hi>Examples</hi> for the Duty: In both of which I ſhall keep to the <hi>Order</hi> of Scripture.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt Family</hi> was ſanctified to GOD in the day wherein it was form'd and conſtituted. When the LORD GOD bro't <hi>Eve</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> he bleſſed them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thereby ſet them apart for Himſelf to be a holy Pair, a religious devoted Family. And the firſt thing we read of in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Family is his <hi>Sons</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping the LORD in his appointed Way. And tho' it be true, that this was their open worſhiping apart, yet it leads us into the certain knowledge of <hi>Adam</hi>'s worſhiping with them, and of his inſtituting them as well by <hi>Example</hi> as by <hi>Inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Precept</hi> in the appointed Worſhip of GOD.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Sons</hi> came out of the <hi>Ark</hi> the preſerved Family made their ſolemn <hi>Thank-Offering</hi> of every kind. This was indeed as much an Act of <hi>public</hi> Worſhip as could then be render'd to GOD, yet it is as true that it was, and could be, no other than a <hi>Family</hi> Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Afterward the pure Worſhip of GOD was preſerved in the Houſhold and Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who as he journeyed from place to place <hi>built Altars unto the</hi> LORD, <hi>and called on his Name</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xii. 7, 8.</note>. His praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the ſight of GOD was the religious Order of his <hi>Houſhold</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">xviii. 19.</note>. <hi>I know him that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the Way of the</hi> LORD. GOD gave him the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which was a <hi>Family Ordinance,</hi> for the <hi>Conſecration</hi> of the Houſhold to GOD; and indeed of all the <hi>Heads</hi> of all the Families that ſhould
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003008_0010_0FEF9CA47A13A918"/>deſcend from him. Doubtleſs expreſs and ſolemn Worſhip accompanied the Act of Circumciſion, that <hi>Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith.</hi> Every Family therefore from the loyns of <hi>Abraham</hi> were hereby put in the way of Family Worſhip. For were <hi>the Children holy?</hi> And muſt not the <hi>Parent</hi> ſee the mark and ſign of GOD'S Covenant put upon them? And yet afterward might he bring up the <hi>devoted Seed</hi> without praying with them?</p>
            <p>But to paſs to the <hi>Law of Moſes:</hi> The <hi>Paſſover</hi> was the other Seal of GOD'S Covenant from <hi>his</hi> time, and it was a <hi>Family</hi> Ordinance. The <hi>Maſter</hi> of the Houſe had this Care laid upon him. Exod. xii. 3. There was a <hi>Lamb</hi> for a Houſe: They eat it as <hi>holy Societies,</hi> in religious manner; it was <hi>a Feaſt to the</hi> LORD thro'out their Generations. The Family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd their Covenant with GOD, and were anew ſanctified to him, in their celebrating this Ordinance of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>Or let us look into the Law of the <hi>Holy Sabbath,</hi> and it ſeems to caſt a ſpecial eye on the Religion and Worſhip of the <hi>Houſhold,</hi> laying the Head of the Family under the Charge of GOD in that matter; <hi>Thou, thy Son and thy Daughter, thy Man-ſervant and thy Maid-ſervant.</hi> — Look alſo into the Laws for the <hi>Feaſt of Weeks and of Tabernacles,</hi> and they are given in like manner; Deut. xvi. 10, 14. <hi>Thou ſhalt rejoice before the</hi> LORD <hi>thy</hi> GOD, <hi>thou and thy Son and thy Daughter,</hi> &amp;c. Or look into the Rule for ſolemn <hi>Mourning,</hi> as on the day of <hi>Faſting</hi> and Supplication, and it runs thus, Zech. xii. 10. <hi>Every Family apart,</hi> and Perſon <hi>apart.</hi> Truly it is the Will of GOD that on the Sabbath-day, and upon all days of public Faſting or Thankſgiving, there be ſpecial Exerciſes of Religion performed with our Families, as well as in our Cloſets or in public Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:003008_0011_0FEF9CA96BB777A0"/>
Paſs we now to the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and we find there many Precepts and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of GOD our SAVIOUR, which do more plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and infer the Duty of Family Worſhip. Such are thoſe Words of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Epheſ. vi. 18. <hi>Praying</hi> ALWAYS <hi>with</hi> ALL <hi>Prayer, and watching thereunto with all perſeverance. "All Prayer</hi> muſt mean all <hi>kinds</hi> of Prayer; public, private, ſecret; ſolitary and ſocial. But Family prayer is <hi>one</hi> kind of Prayer, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be attended <hi>always,</hi> and watch'd unto with all perſeverance.</p>
            <p>Another Text that ſeems to look to Family Prayer is that, Philip. iv. 6. <hi>Be careful for nothing, but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing by Prayer and Supplication let your Requeſts be made known to</hi> GOD. Men are in a ſpecial manner apt to be <hi>careful</hi> and anxious how to provide for their Houſholds, how to feed and clothe their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; But let Family <hi>Prayer</hi> and ſecret Prayer be the Antidote and ſovereign Remedy againſt this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and painful diſorder of our Minds. Carry the care of your Families to GOD in daily Prayers. But ſhall this be only in Secret? Why not alſo in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with them?</p>
            <p>Another place that has a fair Aſpect on Family Worſhip is Col. iii. 17. <hi>And whatſoever ye do in word or deed do all in the Name of the</hi> LORD JESUS, <hi>giving Thanks unto</hi> GOD <hi>and the</hi> FATHER <hi>by Him.</hi> In the verſe before the Exhortation is, <hi>Let the Word of</hi> CHRIST <hi>dwell in you richly, teaching and admoniſhing one another in Pſalms</hi> &amp;c. And in the verſe after <hi>Wives</hi> are exhorted <hi>to ſubmit themſelves unto their own Husbands as is fit in the</hi> LORD. Whatſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is done <hi>in the Houſhold,</hi> in word or deed, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to be done <hi>in the Name of</hi> CHRIST, with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Thankſgiving to GOD. — And then in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the next <hi>Chapter, Maſters</hi> of Families are required to <hi>continue in prayer, and to watch in the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003008_0012_0FEF9CAB0AB53DD0"/>ſame with Thankſgiving.</hi> Theſe Precepts are directed to <hi>Houſholders</hi> by name, to continue in daily Prayers and Praiſes <hi>with their Families.</hi> This ſeems the moſt fair and eaſy, natural and genuine <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in this place.</p>
            <p>Again we are taught and commanded, I. Theſſ. v. 17, 18. to <hi>pray without ceaſing, and in every thing to give Thanks.</hi> If <hi>in every thing,</hi> then ſurely in our Families, for all Family Mercies. — A like Precept we have I. Tim. ii. 8. <hi>I will that Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands without Wrath.</hi> If <hi>every where,</hi> then ſurely in our <hi>Houſes,</hi> and with our <hi>Houſholds.</hi> This is one of the <hi>firſt</hi> places that occur to us. And the <hi>Caution</hi> of holy Hands, without Wrath, is pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly proper to <hi>Houſholds,</hi> where Angers and Wraths do eſpecially unfit for holy Prayers. — It follows, <hi>Let the Women adorn themſelves with Sobriety and good Works,</hi> and <hi>let the Woman learn in Silence with all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; for Adam was firſt formed and then Eve.</hi> Which ſeems to determine the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s meaning in foregoing <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> to Family Prayer.</p>
            <p>Moreover, That our <hi>Houſes</hi> ſhould be places for Prayer, and that there ſhould be occaſional Prayers with the <hi>Houſhold,</hi> is plain from the Commandment and Direction of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> v. 14, 15. <hi>Is any ſick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him —.</hi> But is <hi>this</hi> the only Occaſion that there is for ſocial Prayer in Families? Should there be Prayer on <hi>this</hi> Occaſion with the Houſhold, and on no other? Or if the <hi>Eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church</hi> muſt be called on this, or the like Occaſion, is not the <hi>Maſter of the Family</hi> to pray and give Thanks with it on many other Occaſions? And are not ſuch Occaſions frequently and daily return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on us? And if on <hi>greater</hi> Occaſions there ſhould be more <hi>ſolemn</hi> and formal Supplications in the Houſe and for it, ſhould there be no prayers in it and for
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003008_0013_0FEF9CAD399D5FD8"/>it on <hi>leſſer</hi> and more ordinary Occaſions, returning every day? Or if <hi>one</hi> of the Family be taken dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly <hi>Sick</hi> once in the year, or in ſeveral years, and this be a loud Call for the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; Is not the continued <hi>Health</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the Family from day to day, and it may be from year to year, as loud a Call for the united daily <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> of the Houſhold?</p>
            <p>But to look into the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter</hi> and cloſe with him. How applicable to Families and Family Worſhip are his Words, I. Epiſt. ii. 5. <hi>A ſpiritual Houſe, an holy Prieſthood, to offer up ſpiritual Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, acceptable to</hi> GOD, <hi>thro'</hi> JESUS CHRIST. The <hi>Church</hi> of GOD is a <hi>ſpiritual Houſe,</hi> and ſo ſhould our <hi>Families</hi> be alſo. <hi>Believers</hi> in CHRIST are a <hi>holy Prieſthood,</hi> but in a ſpecial manner to their <hi>Houſholds;</hi> to offer up <hi>with them</hi> (as well as by themſelves in ſecret) the ſpiritual <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of Praiſe and Prayer. — See alſo I. Peter iii. 7. <hi>Let the Husbands dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the Wife as to the weaker Veſſel,</hi> and as being <hi>Heirs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the Grace of Life, that your</hi> PRAYERS <hi>be not hindred.</hi> The ſeveral <hi>Relatives</hi> in a Family ſhould live together as Heirs of the Grace of Life; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould pray, both together and apart, for one another: But eſpecially the Care about the Prayers of the Houſhold lies on the Head of the Family. It is ſuppoſed that there be Prayers <hi>in</hi> the Family; that the Husband pray for and with the Wife; and why not the latter as well as the former? And the Husband is wiſely directed to treat the Wife with Tenderneſs, to bear with her Infirmities, and by governing himſelf well toward her to keep up love and peace in the Family; That ſo <hi>their Prayers,</hi> and thoſe of the Houſhold, whether together or apart, <hi>be not hindred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the <hi>Notices</hi> and Intimations of the Mind of GOD in his <hi>Word</hi> about <hi>Family Worſhip;</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003008_0014_0FEF9CB239A16EE8"/>amounting (as I judge) to a plain Revelation of his Will in the matter, and ſo to a Precept and Injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning it.</p>
            <p>I conclude this Head with the Words of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> on this Argument; "Let me tell you (ſays he) that it is <hi>Ignorance</hi> to call for <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and expreſs <hi>Scriptures</hi> that require praying in Families, as if we tho't the <hi>general Commands</hi> were not ſufficient, and did not comprehend this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p>I come now to conſider the <hi>Scripture Examples</hi> for Family Worſhip: By which I mean what we find related and recorded concerning one Perſon and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, bearing a favourable Aſpect on this Practice.</p>
            <p>I might name <hi>Adam, Noah</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, having hinted at them before. <hi>Iacob</hi> was a like godly Worſhiper with his Houſhold, having learn'd it of his pious <hi>Anceſtors,</hi> and inheriting the Spirit with the Bleſſing of <hi>Abraham.</hi> He died, as he liv'd, worſhiping with his Sons around him, pouring out Prayers for them, and bleſſing them, one by one, in the Name of the LORD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Job</hi> was a like devout Worſhiper of GOD with his Family. GOD gave him <hi>ſeven Sons and three Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> and as in their <hi>Childhood</hi> he had daily worſhip'd with them, ſo when they were <hi>adult,</hi> and ſetled in Houſes of their own, he frequently call'd them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to worſhip with him: <hi>He ſent for them and ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified them, offering Burnt-Offerings, according to the number of them all: Thus did Job continually.</hi> Theſe were his Family Sacrifices, and he was very conſtant and ſolemn in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſhua</hi> gave his ſenſe of Family Religion, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Worſhip of the Houſhold, in that famous and noble <hi>Reſolve,</hi> Joſh. xxiv. 15. <hi>As for me and my Houſe, we will ſerve the</hi> LORD. He reſolv'd for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Houſhold, thoſe that were his immediate
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003008_0015_0FEF9CB5BAEDA9B0"/>Charge and Care, living under his roof. Himſelf and his houſe he joyns in the Worſhip, for they daily joyn'd in it. <hi>"I and my Domeſtics,</hi> I with them and they with me; I and they together and apart. He ſpake as the Maſter and Head of a Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> the Father of <hi>David,</hi> was a religious <hi>Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder</hi> and worſhip'd GOD with his Family. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of occaſional <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in his Fathers houſe. 1. Sam. xx. 6. They had their <hi>annual</hi> or <hi>monthly</hi> Sacrifices, and why not the daily?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> had learn'd of his pious Father, and was taught of GOD <hi>to bleſs his Houſhold;</hi> i. e. to pray and give thanks with them, to GOD, for his Bleſſing on them. This became ſo great a <hi>King,</hi> and ſo illuſtrious a <hi>Saint,</hi> the <hi>Man after</hi> GOD's <hi>own Heart.</hi> Who would wiſh for a better Pattern or Teacher? Would to GOD that all <hi>Kings</hi> would learn of him, all <hi>Rulers</hi> imitate him, in the Devotions of their Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds. To be ſure all <hi>Saints</hi> will gladly follow his more than <hi>royal</hi> Example. The leaſt and <hi>loweſt</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us may have a Houſhold to rule and <hi>bleſs,</hi> and has this Authority in his own Houſe, as much as the Prince hath in his. II. Sam. vi. 20. <hi>Then David returned to bleſs his Houſhold.</hi> From an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Act of ſolemn <hi>public</hi> Devotion, from bleſſing the Congregation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> both as a Prophet and their Prince, he came <hi>home</hi> and bleſs'd his <hi>Family</hi> in the Name of the LORD. He bleſs'd and prais'd GOD with <hi>them</hi> that day, and implor'd his Bleſſing on them. Every Man is a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Prieſt</hi> in his own Houſe, to <hi>rule</hi> for GOD and to lead in his Worſhip. <hi>He returned</hi> to bleſs his Houſe: It ſeems to ſpeak his Cuſtom and <hi>Uſe</hi> to bleſs it. Was this the <hi>only</hi> time? or the firſt or laſt time that <hi>David</hi> returned from GOD's Houſe to bleſs his own? No, it ſeems to have been no <hi>new</hi> thing to Him or them. He was wont to do ſo on <hi>Sabbaths</hi> and other <hi>Feſtivals.</hi> His Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003008_0016_0FEF9CB8F28BF100"/>no doubt expected Him; and were in waiting to receive his Bleſſing. <hi>Michal</hi> alone was out of frame, but not ſo the <hi>Maids of Honour</hi> attending her.</p>
            <p>I will name but one more <hi>Example</hi> from the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament: It is <hi>Daniel. Three times a day</hi> he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd GOD openly and ſolemnly in his Houſe. How elſe ſhould his <hi>Enemies</hi> have known his Practice, or been able to have convicted him as they did? Had it been the Worſhip of his <hi>Cloſet,</hi> the Rule ever was and is <hi>to ſhut the window and the door, and pray to Him that ſees in Secret.</hi> But <hi>Daniel</hi>'s daily Prayers were open in the ſight and hearing of his Enemies. Doubtleſs it was the Worſhip in his <hi>Chapel,</hi> or of his Houſhold together.. Dan. vi. 10, 11. <hi>Now when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel knew that the Writing was ſigned, he went into his Houſe, and his windows being open in his Chamber to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Jeruſalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave Thanks before his</hi> GOD, <hi>as he did aforetime: Then theſe Men aſſembled, and found Daniel praying and making Supplication before his</hi> GOD. Judge if this be not meant of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Worſhip with his Houſhold, rather than his retired Devotions by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Neither Morning nor Evening prayer were wanting in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s houſe. They that pleas'd might make themſelves <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the Worſhip of his Houſe, nor would he change the <hi>Order</hi> of it for the Kings Decree. The door of his <hi>Chapel</hi> ſtood open for his <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Diſperſion and others. He choſe to <hi>die</hi> rather than ceaſe his Family Worſhip for <hi>thirty days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Scriptures of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> I ſhall only name our LORD Himſelf, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> the firſt-fruit of the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>JESUS is the great <hi>Pattern</hi> to his Church; the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of <hi>Prayer</hi> and Devotion, <hi>alone</hi> by Himſelf and <hi>with</hi> his Diſciples. The Families of the Earth are

               <hi>bleſſed</hi> in Him, with reſpect to his <hi>Example</hi> in this point. He has taught them to pray both together and apart. JESUS had a <hi>Family.</hi> He choſe and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the <hi>Twelve</hi> to be with him. Mark iii. 14. They attended him wherever He went, as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Domeſtics.</hi> Tho' He had not where to lay his Head, yet there was a Family Relation between <hi>Him</hi> and the <hi>Twelve,</hi> of Maſter and Servants, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Scholars. <hi>They left all and followed Him.</hi> He called them his <hi>Houſhold,</hi> and Himſelf the <hi>Maſter of the Houſe.</hi> Matth. x. 25. And as ſuch he <hi>fed</hi> them from day to day, and eat the <hi>Paſſover</hi> with them. Mark xiv. 14. He often <hi>taught</hi> them in private, and <hi>pray'd</hi> with them in private, as his Domeſtics. Luke ix. 18. <hi>As he was alone praying, his Diſciples were with him</hi> i. e. He was praying with them, by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only. He was not alone by Himſelf, for the Diſciples were with him. It was a Family Prayer. It was neither public nor ſecret Prayer, but private with his Houſhold. And ſuch we may call his wondrous Prayer juſt before his Paſſion, John. xvii. What a famous and glorious Inſtance was this of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Worſhip, on an extraordinary Occaſion? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in therefore our LORD was the more inlarged and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate. Thus JESUS is the Pattern for Family Worſhip to all Worſhipers.</p>
            <p>And <hi>whom</hi> ſhall we name after Him? Which of the <hi>Houſhold? Peter,</hi> or <hi>James,</hi> or <hi>John?</hi> Neither of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> tho' doubtleſs they followed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of JESUS in this Duty; But let CORNELIUS (a Gentile Worſhiper, <hi>a Centurion of the Italian Band</hi>) have this Honour; as <hi>a good Soldier of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. We have his excellent Character, Acts x. 2. <hi>A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Man, and one that feared</hi> GOD <hi>with all his Houſe, and prayed to</hi> GOD <hi>always. As he was praying in his Houſe, he had a Viſion of an Angel of</hi> GOD; <hi>behold a Man ſtood before him in bright clothing.</hi> The beſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003008_0018_0FEF9CC0B6E81B48"/>
               <hi>Expoſitors</hi> take it for a pregnant Inſtance of Houſhold Worſhip. And if ſo, it was a good Beginning, a good and leading Example, among the <hi>Gentile</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts. He prayed <hi>always,</hi> with <hi>all his Houſe.</hi> It was at the <hi>ninth Hour,</hi> the time of the <hi>Evening</hi> Sacrifice. If it was a Family Prayer, GOD put a double honour on it; By <hi>one</hi> Viſion he directed <hi>Cornelius</hi> to ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> and by <hi>another</hi> he prepar'd <hi>Peter</hi> to go. But above all, He pour'd out the HOLY GHOST upon theſe Gentile Worſhipers, while <hi>Peter</hi> preach'd to to them. Thus did the HOLY ONE own and honour the Prayers of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his <hi>Houſhold.</hi> Let it encourage and confirm all believing Houſholders in the practice of Family-prayer.</p>
            <p>Methinks the <hi>elect Lady and her Children</hi> were ſuch a Family of Devotion; and <hi>Lydia</hi> and her Houſe; and ſo <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila, Nymphas</hi> and <hi>Philemon, with the Church in their Houſe.</hi> Probably their Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Neighbours might meet for Worſhip at theſe Houſes on <hi>Lord's days</hi> and at other times. But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Families were <hi>as little Churches,</hi> and worthy to be ſo called becauſe of the good <hi>Order</hi> and daily <hi>Worſhip</hi> of GOD in them.

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003008_0019_0FEF9CC24AA99570"/>a godly <hi>Perſon</hi> and his religious Houſhold: Like one of the Epiſtles of <hi>John,</hi> to <hi>the elect Lady and her Children.</hi> "It was the Aggravation of the Fault of <hi>Oneſimus</hi> (as One obſerves) that he left ſuch a Family, and ran away from ſuch a Maſter, where he had been well taught both by Word and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <q>All Families ſhould be Nurſeries of Religion, as <hi>Philemons</hi> was; i. e. Societies in which GOD is daily call'd upon, where he is daily praiſed, where his Word is daily read, and the Sabbaths of GOD are reſted on, and kept religiouſly in the private and public Duties of them:</q> Where GOD's <hi>Law is in the Heart</hi> of Parents, Maſters and Miſtreſſes, and is <hi>diligently taught unto the Children.</hi> Such Families are Nurſeries for the Church and <hi>Table</hi> of CHRIST, to fill them with worthy <hi>Communicants. Oneſimus</hi> upon his Repentance was reſtored in this Family, as a ſinning Member is in the Churches of CHRIST, <hi>above a Servant, a Brother beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have gather'd up the Voice and Senſe of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as truly and briefly as I could, on this important point of Family Worſhip; and have kept very much to the <hi>Order</hi> of Scripture in doing it. From hence have the <hi>Godly</hi> in all Places and Ages of the Church, gone into the practice of this Duty. And all that uprightly practice it have the pleaſure, comfort and profit of it. None ever repented of it, or are like to repent of it. Theſe are <hi>the footſteps of the Flocks,</hi> and thus <hi>the Sheep feed,</hi> and their Lambs with them, <hi>beſides the Shepherds Tents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I come now to give <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Duty of Family Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt be <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>conſtant</hi> in the Duty. Let no day paſs without ſecret and family Prayer, reading GOD'S Word, and ſolemn Thankſgiving to Him for perſonal and relative Mercies. Let GOD
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003008_0020_0FEF9CC50E8BA9D0"/>have his Dues in thy Houſe, his morning and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices. Pſalm xcii. 1 <hi>It is a good thing to give Thanks unto the</hi> LORD, <hi>and to ſing Praiſes to thy Name,</hi> O MOST HIGH! <hi>to ſhew forth thy Loving kindneſs in the Morning, and thy Faithfulneſs every Night.</hi> Pſalm v. 2. <hi>My voice ſhalt thou hear in the Morning, O</hi> LORD! <hi>in the Morning will I direct my Prayer unto Thee, and will look up.</hi> Pſalm cxli. 2. <hi>Let my Prayer be ſet forth before Thee as Incenſe, and the lifting up of my hands as the Evening Sacrifice.</hi> Theſe ſtated Exerciſes ſhould never be omitted, without a plain Neceſſity conſtrain to it; but in extraordinary Caſes, as thoſe of great Affliction and Sorrow, the Family may need to be pray'd with three and four times a day: And <hi>Days</hi> of Prayer may be call'd for in them.</p>
            <p>It was Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s declared Judgment, That the Maſter of a Family ought rather to omit ſecret Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in his Cloſet, than private Prayer with his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. <q>Family Prayer (ſays he) is of greateſt Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, becauſe each Perſon is concerned in it. You muſt rather take up with Family prayer alone, than with ſecret alone.</q> — Let us not on any little pretence, or ſmall occaſion, omit this Duty. Let us walk before GOD in our houſes in this daily Courſe. Let us be conſtant and ſteddy in it, like the <hi>Sun</hi> in its Circuit, as Day and Night in their return. As the Sun <hi>ariſeth</hi> let us get up to worſhip and ſerve GOD, <hi>the Father of Light;</hi> And as it <hi>knows its going down,</hi> ſo let us know and keep our Hour of Evening Prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us be <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> in Family Worſhip. It is doubly <hi>beautiful,</hi> pleaſant and profitable in its <hi>Seaſon.</hi> Out of ſeaſon it very much loſes its beauty, pleaſure and profit. Yet the <hi>Occaſions</hi> of Families may cauſe ſome <hi>Variety</hi> here. One and the ſame <hi>Time</hi> will not ſure all Families, nor always the ſame Family. The <hi>Rule</hi> in general is, When the Houſhold can be beſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003008_0021_0FEF9CC877A554B0"/>and moſt <hi>together.</hi> Another is Not too late in the Morning, nor in the Evening.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> looks too ſlothful, and often comes by drowſing too long in Bed. But let GOD and our <hi>Souls</hi> have the firſt and freſh Tho'ts of the Morning. Let us not ſtay to do a good part of the Mornings Work before we wait upon GOD. Freſh and faſting may be a good Rule; healthful to the Soul and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norary to GOD. Firſt let us ſerve GOD with our Houſhold, and then ſerve our <hi>ſelves</hi> of them. So let all the Work of the Day be ſanctified <hi>early,</hi> by the Word and Prayer. Let GOD'S Work be done before our own. Pſalm cviii. <hi>Awake up my Glory, awake early.</hi> The <hi>Letter</hi> here agrees to a <hi>Morning</hi> Song, from an <hi>early</hi> Riſer. Such have a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage both for ſecret and private Worſhip.</p>
            <p>But more eſpecially let not the <hi>Evening</hi> Prayers be <hi>late</hi> and drowſie, dream'd over half aſleep. It is beſt for Families to be early in bed, and much more to be early in the Evening Worſhip. Late <hi>Viſits</hi> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily cauſe late Prayers in our own and others Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Staying late at the <hi>Tavern</hi> is yet a worſe Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where the Heads of Families too often keep one another till the Seaſon is paſt for the Evening Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and they are unfit for either private or ſecret Prayer. But if we loiter and <hi>trifle</hi> away the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our own Houſes, till it grow late and the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold are half aſleep, it comes near to the ſame thing. — It is therefore a ſpecial <hi>Rule</hi> in the Caſe before us, that we keep Time and Seaſon in praying with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Families. And truly it might have been even better ſometimes to have omitted the holy Service, than to have attended it in the diſorders of Sleepineſs and Yauning. The <hi>Oblation is vain,</hi> and the <hi>Incenſe</hi> becomes <hi>an Abomination.</hi> Both GOD and Man is <hi>weary to bear them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:003008_0022_0FEF9CCC142DAA28"/>
3. We ſhould neither be too <hi>long,</hi> nor too <hi>ſhort,</hi> in Family worſhip. An Error on either hand is hurtful. <hi>Prolixity</hi> ſhould be carefully avoided; much leſs ſhould it be affected. It makes the Duty <hi>tedious,</hi> and is the way to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ak in upon the commanded <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> of the Day, or neceſſary <hi>Reſt</hi> of the Night. — On the other hand, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be <hi>curſory</hi> and ſlighty in Family Worſhip is to make <hi>nothing</hi> of it, or <hi>worſe</hi> than nothing. Let us not grudge to GOD the Time and Pains of a ſutable Supplication and Thankſgiving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Family prayer</hi> ſhould be rather ſhort than long. But let it be long eno' to anſwer the Intention and deſign of it. It is neither to be crouded into a ſingle Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or two, nor ſhould it be drawn out into a great length. In all ſocial Prayer the Rule and Caution to us is that, Mat. vi. 7. <hi>Uſe not vain Repetitions, nor think to be heard for your much ſpeaking.</hi> Yet at ſome times we are called by Providence, and directed by the SPIRIT of Grace, to be <hi>longer</hi> than other. Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is profitable to obſerve and direct. At times again we may and ſhould <hi>ſhorten</hi> our Prayers. But ſee (ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) that formal <hi>Affectation</hi> be not the lengthener of your Prayers at any Time, nor carnal <hi>Wearineſs</hi> the ſhortner of them.</p>
            <p>There are times of Family trials and afflictions, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when Sickneſs and Death come into our Houſes, which call us to inlarge our Supplications, with Confeſſions to GOD, and Humiliations before Him: Again there are times of Family mercies, which call us to abound in Praiſes and Thankſgivings to GOD: Let Providence lead us, and a Spirit of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Devotion act us, and let the Glory of GOD and the Edification of our Houſhold direct and govern us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us be ſure that we be <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>ſincere,</hi> and alſo <hi>reverend ſolemn and fervent</hi> in the Exerciſes of Family worſhip. Let us take heed that we be not
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003008_0023_0FEF9CD09B9D9C50"/>formal and cuſtomary, cold and careleſs, dull and lifeleſs in the Duty. Let it not be a meer Form and round of Worſhip. This can't be too earneſtly warn'd or watch'd againſt. GOD looks to the Heart and Spirit in all our Worſhip. The ſame Exerciſe of Grace he requires from us, in the Cloſet, in the Family, or in the Church. We have to do with the ſame GOD in all places and at all times, and unto Him we muſt <hi>lift up</hi> our Souls, and call upon him <hi>in Truth.</hi> The Precept and Rule to us is, Heb. xii. 28. <hi>Let us have Grace whereby we may ſerve</hi> GOD <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, with Reverence and godly Fear.</hi> He is greatly to be feared in a <hi>Family</hi> of Worſhipers, as well as in the Aſſembly and <hi>Congregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as we muſt <hi>ſanctify the</hi> LORD <hi>in our Hearts,</hi> ſo we ſhould be grave, reverend and ſolemn in our Voice, Geſture, Deportment and Behaviour, while we worſhip GOD in our Families. Indeed we ſhould beware of being noiſie and oſtentatious in it, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Show or the Obſervation of Men; but yet neither let us be afraid of being obſerved, ſeen or heard by others, but deſire to have our <hi>Light ſhine before</hi> them; if they may be excited hereby <hi>to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our</hi> FATHER <hi>which is in Heaven.</hi> Aim at the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and honouring GOD, and the Salvation of thy Self and Family; and by thy <hi>reverend</hi> Example con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Reverence of thy Houſhold; and by thy Earneſtneſs and <hi>Affection</hi> endeavour to move their Affections, and make them in earneſt: And by thy Authority command all in thy Houſe to ſhow Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Reverence. Humility and godly Fear, Faith Love and earneſt Deſire, with holy Pleaſure and Satisfaction, is the Life and Soul of Worſhip; all in all in it; whether it be in ſecret, in private or in public.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Tye not your Self to a <hi>Form,</hi> nor yet indulge too much <hi>Liberty</hi> of Speech, in Family Worſhip. A
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003008_0024_0FEF9CD22D5FE7E0"/>good <hi>Form</hi> may be uſeful and needful for ſome, but it is not to be adviſed or choſen without Neceſſity. The modeſty and baſhfulneſs of ſome underſtanding Chriſtians is not Reaſon eno' for ſuch an Indulgence. It were rather fit for ſome more bold and conceited Perſons. A ſmall Gift may ſuffice for ſutable &amp; pertinent Family Prayer. Let us covet the beſt Gift in it, and do our beſt; and then the leaſt will be accepted of GOD. But if any uſe a Form, let him not be <hi>formal</hi> in it, but ſtill <hi>pray with the Spirit and with Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> To ſuch I would recommend the <hi>Forms</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> in his Book called, <hi>A Method of Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some by taking too great <hi>Freedom</hi> in Family pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, have but ſpoilt the Devotion of the Houſhold, and expos'd the Duty to contempt. It had been much better if ſuch had uſed ſome <hi>good Form of ſound Words.</hi> The wiſe Houſholder muſt think ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, what will moſt honour GOD and edify the Family.</p>
            <p>Both <hi>Miniſters</hi> in public, and Houſholders in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, ſhould take heed what Liberties they allow themſelves in Prayer. And yet, both Families and Congregations muſt make Allowances, at Times more eſpecially, for Infirmity and Weakneſſes in thoſe that lead in Prayer. <hi>Solomon</hi>'s warning and caution is needful to be kept in mind, Eccleſs. v. 2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be haſty, to utter any thing before</hi> GOD: <hi>For</hi> GOD <hi>is in Heaven and thou upon Earth; therefore let thy Words be few:</hi> "well conſidered and digeſted. That wiſe <hi>Proverb</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> is of great Uſe, as well in the religious as common Uſe of Speech; <hi>In the multitude of Words there wanteth not Sin, but he that refraineth his lips is wiſe.</hi> "It is not eno' (ſays Mr. <hi>Henry</hi>) that what we ſpeak comes from the <hi>Heart,</hi> but it muſt come from a <hi>compoſed</hi> Heart. As the Mouth muſt not be
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003008_0025_0FEF9CD5A328FDE8"/>
               <hi>raſh,</hi> ſo the Heart muſt not be <hi>haſty.</hi> We muſt think <hi>twice</hi> before we ſpeak, either from GOD in <hi>Preaching,</hi> or to GOD in <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us be careful and reverend in our coming <hi>boldly to the Throne of Grace.</hi> Let us take with us <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Words and Frame, <hi>Behold I have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to ſpeak unto the</hi> LORD, <hi>who am but duſt and aſhes!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. On the LORD'S-<hi>day</hi> we ſhould ordinarily be more inlarged in Duties of Worſhip, both in the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet and in the Family. <hi>The Day is holy</hi> for this End and Uſe, that we ſhould ſpend it in the "public and private Exerciſes of GOD'S Worſhip. As we muſt needs attend the public <hi>Aſſemblies,</hi> on the LORD'S-day, for <hi>it is a holy Convocation;</hi> So <hi>it is the Sabbath of the</hi> LORD <hi>in our Dwellings.</hi> This is no <hi>Judaizing,</hi> but as it was from the Beginning, is and ever ſhall be. So we <hi>call the Sabbath our Delight</hi> in the beſt manner, and <hi>find not our own Pleaſure</hi> on it; <hi>think not our own Tho'ts, nor ſpeak our own Words.</hi> As the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the <hi>Law</hi> were doubled on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> ſo it is fitting under the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that our Family Sacrifices of Praiſe and Prayer be inlarg'd and doubled on the LORD'S-<hi>day.</hi> If on other days the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD ſhould be read in our Houſes, on <hi>this</hi> more. If Prayer and Praiſe be requiſite every day, ſurely they are more on the holy Sabbath. Then eſpecially we ſhould remember <hi>the</hi> LORD <hi>our Sanciti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,</hi> and be found in all the Means of our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether more private or public. And what is the fruit of the <hi>neglect</hi> of Family worſhip on the LORD'S-days, but <hi>ſports</hi> and <hi>paſtimes</hi> on them, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen profaneſs and debauchery. Hence comes the loſs of all ſerious Religion, and the growth of all manner of Irreligion. Let us therefore be the more abundant and ſolemn in Family Worſhip on the LORD'S <hi>day.</hi> Secret and private Worſhip thereon
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003008_0026_0FEF9CDB46B8FA50"/>prepares for the public, and that again ſhould inlarge us for the other: As <hi>David</hi> returned from the moſt ſolemn Exerciſes of <hi>public</hi> Devotion, <hi>to bleſs his own Houſhold.</hi> Theſe had not tir'd and unfitted him, but the more prepar'd him for his Family Thankſgiving in the Evening.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In our Family prayers let it be a <hi>Rule</hi> with us, that there be much of <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> in the Duty. Indeed GOD ſometimes puts our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies into Mourning, and calls them to ſolemn Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, Confeſſions and Supplications; as hath been ſaid before. Nor ought Confeſſion of Sin, with Supplications for Grace and Mercy, to be ever miſſing in Family prayers. But we are too apt to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the part of Thankſgiving and Praiſe, in our daily Devotions, by our Selves or with Others; which is a very ill and ungrateful thing</p>
            <p>Our perſonal and Family <hi>Mercies</hi> are many and great from day to day, and they call for a religious notice every day. In the days of our Afflictions and Mournings, the darkeſt days that paſs over our Houſes, our Mercies are <hi>new</hi> every morning and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, &amp; ought never to be forgotten or overlook'd. How much leſs in the <hi>Months that</hi> GOD <hi>preſerves us,</hi> and while <hi>his Candle is ſhining on our Tabernacles:</hi> Then ſhould the <hi>Voice of Rejoicing and Thankſgiving</hi> be loud in them, every Morning and Night. — This likewiſe makes the daily Service <hi>pleaſant</hi> to the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, and tends to raiſe and fix the hearts of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the holy Duty; <hi>Praiſe</hi> being <hi>comely for the Upright,</hi> and the joyful Work of Heaven &amp; Eternity. We ſhould never be weary in it now, as we hope ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ceaſe from it hereafter. Pſalm civ. ult. <hi>I will ſing unto the</hi> LORD <hi>as long as I live, I will ſing Praiſes to my</hi> GOD <hi>while I have my Being. My Meditation of Him ſhall be ſweet, I will be glad in the</hi> LORD.</p>

The <hi>firſt</hi> Petition in the LORD'S-<hi>prayer</hi> is, <hi>Thy Name be hallowed,</hi> and Doxology cloſes it, <hi>For thine is the Kingdom, Power and Glory:</hi> So let us be evermore <hi>awaking up our Glory, to give Praiſes and not be Silent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let no Family <hi>afflictions</hi> unfit us and put us out of Tune for this; no Bereavement or Death in our Houſes: But in this Caſe let us learn of the excellent Example of <hi>Job,</hi> who when his Family and Eſtate were deſtroy'd together, fell down in his Houſe and worſhip'd, ſaying, <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>gave, and the</hi> LORD <hi>has taken; bleſſed be the Name of the</hi> LORD! <hi>Shall we receive Good at the Hand of the</hi> LORD, <hi>and ſhall we not receive Evil?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Let <hi>no leven of Wickedneſs</hi> be found in our Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. This is a neceſſary and ſpecial Direction for the effectual and fervent Worſhip of GOD in our Families. For <hi>if we regard Iniquity in our hearts, the</hi> LORD <hi>will not hear our Prayers,</hi> Pſalm lxvi. 18. Sin ſpoils all our Worſhip, of every ſort; mental or oral, ſolitary or ſocial. <hi>The Sacrifice of the wicked is Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi> Moſt wiſe and neceſſary is <hi>Zophar</hi>'s Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to us, Job xi. 13, 14, 15. <hi>If thou prepare thy Heart, and ſtretch out thy Hands to</hi> GOD; <hi>if ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity be in thy hand put it away, and let not Wickedneſs dwell in thy Tabernacle; for then ſhalt thou lift up thy face without ſpot.</hi> It is the Rule and Law in <hi>all</hi> Prayer, and at all Times, James iv. 8. <hi>Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and purify your hearts ye double-minded! draw nigh to</hi> GOD <hi>and he will draw nigh to you.</hi> The Man that had been <hi>blind from his birth</hi> knew this, <hi>that</hi> GOD <hi>heareth not Sinners; but if any Man be a Worſhiper of</hi> GOD <hi>and doth his Will, him He heareth.</hi> Spoken like <hi>a Child of Light.</hi> As therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> were to <hi>ſearch</hi> their Houſes and purge them from <hi>Leven,</hi> in their Preparation for the Solemnity of the <hi>Paſſover;</hi> ſo we muſt <hi>waſh our Hearts from wickedneſs</hi> when we go to pray to our FATHER in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003008_0028_0FEF9CDF8E560370"/>ſecret, and <hi>cleanſe our Houſes</hi> from it, when we go to <hi>bleſs</hi> them in the Name of the LORD; who will not elſe bleſs them at our Prayer. Prov. iii. 33. <hi>The Curſe of the</hi> LORD <hi>is in the Houſe of the wicked, but he bleſſeth the Habitation of the Juſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. In a particular manner watch againſt <hi>Anger, Strife &amp; Wrath</hi> in thy Family, that the Worſhip of GOD in it be not hindred. This <hi>old Leven</hi> ſpoils the Prayers of Houſholds, and makes them become Sin. There is no greater hindrance either of ſecret or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Prayer. It takes away the heart and face for the Duty. The Law to us is, I. Tim. ii. 8. <hi>I will that Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands, without Wrath.</hi> A wrathful Mind can't lift up a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hand to GOD. The diſorder of the Heart pollutes the Prayer. The GOD of Peace and Love can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure the Prayers of a Houſe where there is <hi>Anger and Strife, Confuſion and every evil Work.</hi> The hearts of ſuch a Houſhold cannot <hi>joyn</hi> in Prayer, and how ſhould GOD accept it? The <hi>Rule</hi> is, <hi>Live in Love, and the</hi> GOD <hi>of Love and Peace ſhall be with you.</hi> Only ſuch <hi>Relatives</hi> can pray <hi>as Heirs together of the Grace of Life,</hi> I. Pet. iii. 7. GOD would not hear <hi>Job</hi> and his <hi>Friends</hi> pray together, or for one another, after their angry and quarrelling Diſputes, till they were reconciled: Job xlii. 8. <hi>Take with you ſeven Bullocks and ſeven Rams, and go to my Servant Job; he ſhall pray for you: And the</hi> LORD <hi>turned away the Captivity of Job, when he prayed for his Friends.</hi> Near Relations are moſt of all bound to love and pray for one another; but if they fall in the <hi>Love,</hi> they will alſo in the <hi>Prayers</hi> which they owe to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Families ſhould be <hi>of one Heart and Soul,</hi> as they are of one <hi>Blood;</hi> and then there is Harmony and Power in their Prayers when they make one Voice to GOD. <hi>If two of you agree on Earth</hi> (ſaid our LORD) <hi>it ſhall be done for you of my</hi> FATHER
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003008_0029_0FEF9CE553935658"/>
               <hi>which is in Heaven.</hi> When we ſtand praying we are requir'd to <hi>forgive</hi> our very Enemies, and to <hi>bleſs them that curſe us.</hi> How then can <hi>Families,</hi> which are Societies more eſpecially under the Law and Bonds of mutual Love, unite in Prayers, if <hi>Love</hi> be wanting in them? This is <hi>my</hi> Commandment (ſaid our LORD JESUS) that ye <hi>love</hi> one another: How then can two or three be together <hi>in his Name,</hi> if it be not in the Spirit of Love? There is neither <hi>Church</hi> Communion, nor <hi>Family</hi> Communion, without the <hi>Law of Kindneſs</hi> and Love ruling in the Hearts of the Members. I. John iv. 7. <hi>Beloved, Let us love one another; for Love is of.</hi> GOD, <hi>and every one that loveth is born of</hi> GOD, <hi>and knoweth</hi> GOD: <hi>He that loveth not knoweth not</hi> GOD, <hi>for</hi> GOD <hi>is Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. "Watch your <hi>worldly Buſineſs,</hi> that it do not eat out the Life and Seriouſneſs of daily Worſhip". This is one of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Rules and a very good one. For as <hi>the Friendſhip of the World is Enmity to</hi> GOD, ſo nothing is more Inimical to vital Piety, to ſecret or family Religion, than the Spirit of this World; <hi>the Cares of it and the Deceitfulneſs of Riches.</hi> Theſe <hi>choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful;</hi> and theſe choke and drive away the Spirit of Prayer.</p>
            <p>— Some are ſo taken up with their worldly Cares and Buſineſſes, that they can find no Time or Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for Family Prayer. They <hi>riſe early, ſit up late,</hi> and <hi>eat the Bread of Carefulneſs;</hi> but neither ſeek to GOD for it, nor thank him for it, as they ought in their Families, while he daily feeds 'em. <hi>One goes to his Farm, and another to his Merchandize,</hi> but they deſire to be <hi>excuſed</hi> from the Prayers of the Cloſet and the Family, day by day. They are <hi>cumber'd with many things,</hi> and neglect the <hi>One thing needful;</hi> which is to <hi>ſit at</hi> JESUS <hi>feet, and hear his Word,</hi> and come in his Name to the Throne of Grace. — Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prayer is not of the World, <hi>even as</hi> CHRIST <hi>is not
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003008_0030_0FEF9CE8C1157358"/>of the World.</hi> It is of the FATHER, and ſpiritual, and <hi>the World hates it.</hi> — Let the Object and Manner of Worſhip be wrong and <hi>falſe,</hi> and the <hi>World goes after the Beaſt:</hi> Let it be an <hi>Idol</hi> that is worſhip'd, in a corrupt and carnal manner, only with bodily Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and every Family ſhall have its <hi>Houſhold-God,</hi> of Wood or of Gold; but go to ſet up the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and pure Worſhip of GOD in a Family, and the Spirit of this World riſes againſt it, and can't endure it, can't admit of it; but finds a thouſand Objections againſt it and Excuſes from it: Then Time can't be found for it, or Inability for it ſhall be pleaded, or the Neceſſity of the thing ſhall be queſtioned; whereas all the while it is only the Spirit of <hi>Demas</hi> poſſeſſing the Perſon, even <hi>the Love of the preſent World.</hi> So neceſſary is the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Prohibition and Dehortation, I. John ii. 16. <hi>Love not the World, nor the things of the World; if any Man love the World the Love of the</hi> FATHER <hi>is not in him.</hi> A ſpiritual Mind, abſtracted from this World and the things of it, is abſolutely neceſſary to a Life of daily ſpiritual Worſhip. <hi>This is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Diligence</hi> in our worldly Callings muſt accompany our daily Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in our Families; elſe we tempt GOD and put our ſelves out of the way of his <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> That gives us our daily Bread, and we muſt ask it of GOD. And the <hi>Rule</hi> to us is that, Philip. iv. 5, 6. <hi>Let your Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be known unto all men, for the</hi> LORD <hi>is at hand; Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by Prayer and Supplication, with Thankſgiving let your Requeſts be made known unto</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In the choice of your worldly <hi>Callings,</hi> in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out your <hi>Children,</hi> and in making <hi>Marriages</hi> for your Selves and Them; have a due Reſpect unto this Duty and Priviledge of <hi>Family Worſhip.</hi> Chuſe not to ſettle in ſuch a Way as will not well conſiſt
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003008_0031_0FEF9CEA63E68570"/>with this Duty. Prefer that Buſineſs, and way of Living, which will beſt agree with the Religion of the Cloſet and of the Houſhold. For this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage think it worth while to abate ſomething of worldly Gains. Chuſe not to put your Children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch Families where the Worſhip of GOD is not upheld; and much leſs be willing to marry them to ſuch Perſons who are like to be diſinclin'd thereunto. So let us endeavour to preſerve and propagate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Religion from Generation to Generation.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And laſtly, Let all our Family Sacrifices be preſented to GOD in the Name of JESUS, <hi>in Whom all the Families of the Earth are bleſſed.</hi> Carry thy Houſhold daily, and all thy Family Worſhip, to the Blood of the great Sacrifice, CHRIST <hi>our Paſſover.</hi> Get all the Souls of thy Houſe, and all thy Prayers for them, <hi>ſprinkled</hi> with the blood of the LAMB. That ſhall ſecure thy Houſe from deſerved Wrath, and procure for it all the Bleſſings it needs. By Faith in a ſacrificed <hi>Saviour,</hi> the <hi>Lamb ſlain,</hi> we may plead, and <hi>wreſtle,</hi> and <hi>prevail</hi> for our Selves and Ours, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did. He wreſtled with the <hi>Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> for his Houſhold, and was named <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Go thou, in the Name and Strength of CHRIST and <hi>do likewiſe.</hi> He is <hi>a merciful and faithful High-Prieſt,</hi> to pray for thee, to breathe in thee, and to <hi>bear away the Iniquity of thy holy Things.</hi> If He <hi>waſh not</hi> Us, our Offſpring, and our Offerings, how ſhall we be accepted by the <hi>Holy</hi> GOD? If he put the <hi>Incenſe</hi> of his Merits to thy Prayers, they ſhall come up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD <hi>a ſweet Odour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have given <hi>Rules and Directions</hi> about the Duty of Family Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. An <hi>Exhortation,</hi> with <hi>Motives</hi> to the Duty, do yet remain. Let us be <hi>exhorted</hi> to the Practice of this Duty, in that wiſe and religious <hi>Manner</hi> which
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003008_0032_0FEF9CEC1A8D0EE0"/>has been directed to. Let ſuch as are in this holy Practice in their Houſes, be exhorted to continue therein, in the Fear of GOD. And let thoſe that are Strangers to the Practice be admoniſhed and warned in the Fear of GOD to come into it. And to move both the one and the other, let me plead with them, for GOD'S <hi>ſake,</hi> for the ſake of their <hi>Families,</hi> for their <hi>own</hi> ſake, and for the ſake of the <hi>Public,</hi> both in Church and State. — Theſe are plain <hi>Motives</hi> and powerful <hi>Arguments,</hi> and ſhould ſink down into our Hearts; both to <hi>convince</hi> thoſe that do not daily read the Word of GOD to their Houſhold, and pray with them, of their Sin in this Omiſſion and Neglect; and to <hi>encourage</hi> and confirm Others to perſevere in this Duty by the Grace of GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, <hi>For</hi> GOD'S <hi>ſake,</hi> for the Glory of his Name; from <hi>Love</hi> to Him and from <hi>Fear</hi> of Him; to pleaſe Him, to obtain his Favour, and to avoid his Wrath; let us all come into and continue in this religious Practice of Family Worſhip. The <hi>Honour</hi> of GOD ſhould be ever uppermoſt in our Hearts, and ly with weight there; it being <hi>the chief End of Man:</hi> And all our Endowments, with all the Advantages which GOD puts into our. hands, ſhould be made to ſubſerve thereunto. In like manner, Nothing ſhould come with more force and power on us, to deter us from living in the Allowance of any Evil, or in the Neglect of any commanded Duty, than the <hi>Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> we bring thereby to the Name of GOD.</p>
            <p>Now what doth the <hi>Glory of</hi> GOD call for from us in our Families? Let us put it to our own <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> and let our Reaſon and Underſtanding impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially anſwer. Is it not for the <hi>Honour of</hi> GOD, and for our glorifying Him together, that we daily and devoutly worſhip Him with our Houſhold? And is it no <hi>Diſhonour</hi> to the Great GOD if he is not ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd, day by day? tho' He be the Founder of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003008_0033_0FEF9CEEF73F2C58"/>the Family, its Preſerver and dully Benefactor! tho' It is HE has formed the <hi>Head</hi> and every <hi>Member</hi> of the Family; has brought them together and <hi>built</hi> them up into a Houſhold? His <hi>Secret</hi> has been on the <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> his <hi>Candle</hi> ſhining on it, his <hi>Eyes</hi> watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over it, his <hi>Hands</hi> ſupplying it plentifully; tho' it is HE that has <hi>girt</hi> it with ſtrength, bleſs'd the ſmall <hi>Beginning</hi> of it, and increaſed the latter <hi>End</hi> of it. Or if it be <hi>afflicted,</hi> its <hi>Afflictions</hi> come not out of the <hi>Duſt,</hi> nor does its <hi>Troubles</hi> ſpring out of the <hi>Ground;</hi> but it is the <hi>Rod of</hi> GOD upon it, which he only can <hi>remove;</hi> or <hi>ſanctify,</hi> which is far the better. How then can GOD be glorified in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> if in every Caſe he be not religiouſly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all his <hi>Ways</hi> toward it; and that by all the Houſhold together, as well as every Member apart? — As our Father <hi>Jacob</hi> in all his Family <hi>Mercies,</hi> and in all his Family <hi>Afflictions,</hi> gave the ſame Glory to GOD; in all his <hi>Fears</hi> concerning them, and in all his <hi>Joys</hi> in them. When he look'd upon his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> his Word was, The LORD <hi>has given me</hi> theſe Flocks: When he look'd upon his <hi>Houſhold,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>I paſs'd this Jordan with my Staff, and</hi> GOD <hi>has made me two Bands:</hi> When he <hi>fear'd</hi> for his Family he carried them to GOD and wreſtled in Prayer for them; <hi>O</hi> GOD <hi>of my Father! deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my Brother; for I fear him, leſt he come and ſinite the Mother with the Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is to give <hi>Glory</hi> unto GOD as the GOD of our Families. And thus we teach our <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> to glorify GOD with us; to know Him, to love him, and to fear him, to pray unto and praiſe Him by themſelves alone. This is better done by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Practice before them every day, than any other way we can think of. Not that other ways ſhould be omitted, but this to be ſure obſerved. So <hi>Eleazar,</hi> the Servant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> learn'd to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003008_0034_0FEF9CF1B2B9EA88"/>the LORD GOD of his Maſter in all his ways; to depend on Him, to ſeek him and give him Glory, in every Affair and Concern of the Family; and more eſpecially in the greater and more important ones: When therefore he ſtood by the <hi>Well</hi> he pray'd, Gen. xxiv. 12. <hi>O</hi> LORD GOD <hi>of my Maſter Abraham! I pray thee ſend me good ſpeed this day, and ſhow kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to my Maſter Abraham: Behold I ſtand by the Well &amp;c.</hi> And when GOD had given him the Token of his Favour which he had pray'd for, <hi>the Man won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at the Thing bowed down his Head and worſhiped,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be the</hi> LORD GOD <hi>of my Maſter Abraham, who has not left my Maſter deſtitute of his Mercy and Truth; I being in the Way, the</hi> LORD <hi>hath led me to the Houſe of my Maſters Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Children and Servants learn to honour and reverence GOD by living in Worſhiping Families. And ſo GOD has Glory not only from the <hi>Head</hi> of the Houſe, but from many a <hi>Branch</hi> of it; the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; lower Members of it. So it ſeems to have been in the happy Houſe of <hi>Cornelius, who feared</hi> GOD <hi>with all his Houſe, and prayed unto</hi> GOD <hi>always.</hi> — In a word, By <hi>Family</hi> Worſhip we train up our Families for the Worſhip both of the <hi>Cloſet</hi> and of the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and teach our Houſholds to pray both in ſecret and in public. And ſo the <hi>Glory</hi> given by Ours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to GOD in <hi>both,</hi> may be very much owing to the Worſhip in the <hi>Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For GOD'S <hi>ſake</hi> therefore, and for the <hi>Glory</hi> of his Name, let us be found in the holy Practice of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Worſhip: which is the <hi>firſt</hi> Motive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> For our <hi>Family and Houſhold's ſake,</hi> for our Children and Servants ſake, let us not live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Family Worſhip; but in the daily and devout practice of it. Let me plead with ſuch as neglect this Duty, for the precious <hi>Souls</hi> committed to their Care by GOD the Father of Spirits; which ought to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003008_0035_0FEF9CF50EA033A0"/>dear to them and for whom they muſt give Account to GOD. Be prevailed on by the natural, ſtrong and tender Love which you bear to your <hi>Offſpring;</hi> and by that Care and Concern which you are bound to have for the <hi>Servants</hi> in your Houſe, to keep up the Worſhip of GOD therein.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, That <hi>if any man provide not for thoſe of his own Houſe</hi> (meaning their <hi>Bodies</hi>) <hi>he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi> I. Tim. v. 8. What an <hi>infidel</hi> Houſe then is that, wherein the <hi>Souls</hi> of the Houſhold are utterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and the Children and Servants are train'd up in Ignorance of GOD, in Irreligion and Profaneſs; without reading GOD'S Word to them, and without Prayer to Him for them, from day to day? How ſhould ſuch Children learn the Fear of the LORD, without which they periſh? <hi>O deſtroy</hi> not thoſe <hi>Souls for which</hi> CHRIST <hi>died;</hi> and which ſhould be to thee as thy own <hi>Bowels,</hi> and more than ſo. While you are far from hating their <hi>Fleſh,</hi> why ſhould you not tenderly care for their better and immortal Part, their living <hi>Spirits?</hi> Can you pretend that you love your Family, without a religious and godly Care for their Souls?</p>
            <p>How did <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Love work toward his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold? GOD tells us how he lov'd his GOD and his Family; Gen xviii. 19. <hi>For I know Abraham, that he will command his Children and his Houſhold after him to keep the Way of the</hi> LORD. So <hi>Job</hi>'s Love to his <hi>Sons</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> wro't by his fearing for them, leſt they ſhould ſin againſt GOD, and by his calling them to his ſolemn Sacrifices, which he offered for them. So <hi>David</hi>'s Love wro't, to his Houſhold; even in his <hi>bleſſing them</hi> from time to time in the Name of the LORD; and alſo in teaching and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, I. Chron. xxviii. 9. <hi>And thou S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>mon, my Son, Know thou the GOD of thy Father, and ſerve him
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003008_0036_0FEF9CF6A682DB30"/>with a perfect Heart &amp;c.</hi> Every religious <hi>Parent</hi> feels within himſelf the moving Words of the great <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Elect Lady</hi> concerning her <hi>Children; I have no greater Joy than to hear of thy Children walking in the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, How can <hi>Maſters</hi> be juſt to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as knowing that they have a MASTER in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? or how can <hi>Parents</hi> train up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD; if they do not lead them into the Fear and Worſhip of GOD from day to day? But indeed they wickedly neglect the <hi>private Means</hi> of their ſaving Illumination and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Calling, Converſion and ſpiritual Edification. For ſurely, Parents and Heads of Families are <hi>the Miniſters of</hi> GOD for this within their own Walls, and are to <hi>attend continually on this very thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But does <hi>this</hi> ſeem to be ſo much as aim'd at, while <hi>Worſhip,</hi> the Means of Grace, is neglected in thy Houſe? <hi>How knoweſt thou, O Man, but that thou may'ſt ſave</hi> thy Houſhold, by the reverend Worſhip of GOD among them? Have you never heard of any that have dated their <hi>Converſion</hi> from ſuch a <hi>Prayer</hi> in a Family? The excellent <hi>Lady</hi> ASHURST (of whoſe Piety and great Devotion I was once a Witneſs for many Weeks together) was an Inſtance of this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy<note n="‖" place="bottom">See the <hi>Fryday</hi> Evening Lectures in <hi>Eaſtcheap</hi> on the Duty of PRAYER. p. 303.</note>. And thouſands there are and thouſands, both living and deceaſed, who are bleſſing GOD, and will bleſs Him for ever, that his Providence diſpoſed of them into ſuch Families of Religion. — On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hand, How knoweſt thou, O Man, but the want of Family Worſhip in thy Houſe may turn to the loſs and eternal perdition of thy Soul, and of the Souls of thy Houſhold! And then, How will they and thy own inraged Conſcience riſe againſt thee in
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003008_0037_0FEF95FF8C36F7E8"/>the Day of Judgment, and condemn thee? Which leads me to the <hi>third</hi> Motive,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For <hi>thy own ſake,</hi> for the ſake of thy <hi>own Soul;</hi> for thy Comfort and Peace in Life and Death, and for thy Safety in the Day of Judgment; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Worſhip of GOD in thy Family. On thy doing thy Duty to GOD, and to thy Family, depends thy <hi>own</hi> eternal Salvation. If thou doſt not conſult the glorifying GOD in thy. Houſe, and the Saving thy Houſhold, thou deſtroyeſt thy own Soul.</p>
            <p>You muſt <hi>watch</hi> for the Souls of your Family, as one that muſt give an <hi>Account</hi> for them to GOD: But what Account can you give of the Neglect of Family Worſhip, and therein of the Neglect of the Souls committed to thy Care? Will not GOD require them of thee another Day? And ſay to thee as in I. Kings xxvi. 39. <hi>Thy Soul ſhall go for</hi> theſe Souls if they periſh: Or as it is in Ezek xvi. 20. <hi>Thou haſt taken my Sons and my Daughters,</hi> and haſt ſacrificed them to Satan, to the World and thy Luſts. And thus you and yours may periſh together.</p>
            <p>Not that Family Worſhip will <hi>ſave</hi> a Man or his Houſe; but it is a Means of Salvation that is by no means to be neglected. Nor that all muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>periſh,</hi> who are ſo unhappy as to live in prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Families; but the loſs of eternal Salvation is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd hereby. And if a prayerleſs Houſholder, and ſome of his Houſhold, periſh hereby, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation will be the greater, becauſe of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Ingratitude to GOD, and his unnatural Neglect of his Family. He ſhall be judged as a profane Wretch toward GOD, and an unnatural Father to his immortal Offſpring, and <hi>a deſpiſer of his own Soul and Ways.</hi> His Offſpring and Servants will riſe up in Judgment againſt him, and accuſe him, that he never inſtructed them by Word and Example in the Worſhip and Fear of GOD, nor in the Care of their
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003008_0038_0FEF9CFDB44E84A8"/>own Souls. And how will he ever look them in the face? and much leſs GOD who put them under his Care? His Guilt will fly in his face, and his own Heart riſe and condemn him. The blood of <hi>Souls,</hi> even of his Wife and Children, may <hi>cry</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him from the Earth before he die, as the blood of <hi>Abel</hi>'s body did againſt wretched <hi>Cain.</hi> This puniſhment will be <hi>greater than he will be able to bear,</hi> nor will he be able to ſay, <hi>Was I their Keeper? Abel</hi>'s Soul was not deſtroyed with his Life; but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a murder'd <hi>Soul</hi> (whether thy own or anothers) will be found a more horrid and hideous Guilt, than any meer murder of the Body, and to deſerve eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death.</p>
            <p>And if the Guilt of prayerleſs Houſholders may be found ſuch in the Day of Judgment, what Pain and Terror may their Sin give them in the day of ſore Affliction, or in the day of Death? Suppoſe this Man upon his <hi>Death-bed,</hi> and his Houſhold gathering about him in that dark hour; how will he take <hi>leave</hi> of them whom he has never <hi>pray'd</hi> with? How will he do then to <hi>bleſs</hi> them, or they him? How ſhall his dying lips pray for them, as <hi>Jacob</hi> pour'd out Bleſſings on his Sons, ſitting up in his Bed? O it muſt be a melancholly <hi>parting,</hi> from a Family that you have never pray'd with! Pray conſider it, and let not another Evening or Morning paſs without a Family Prayer For they or you may <hi>die</hi> before to Morrow: This Night may their or your Soul be required or called away: And can you think of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and going into Eternity, without having pray'd together as a Family? How do you think to meet in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and live praiſing and bleſſing GOD together for ever and ever? Or how can you think of being caſt together into <hi>Hell,</hi> &amp; for never bleſſing GOD toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this Life, come to blaſpheme him for ever, and curſe one another eternally, in the World to come?</p>

But before Death comes, how miſerable are ſuch Families, ſuch Relatives, in all their <hi>Afflictions?</hi> What Comfort can they find from one another under them, who have never been us'd to worſhip and pray together? What <hi>miſerable Comforters</hi> are ſuch like to be to each other? How can they pray for one another or ſpeak of the Conſolations of GOD to one another, in the days of their Trouble &amp; Diſtreſs?</p>
            <p>On every Account therefore, preſent or future, <hi>for the ſake of thy own Soul</hi> pray with thy Houſhold dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for thy happy and holy Living here, and for the eternal Well-being and Happineſs (if it pleaſe GOD) both of thy <hi>Self</hi> and <hi>Family.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Good</hi> is unknown that the <hi>Public</hi> receives; unknown is the <hi>Benefit</hi> to a People both in Church and State, by the ſerious <hi>Worſhip</hi> of GOD in Families.

               <hi>that telleth lies to tarry in his Sight.</hi> And it is from Families ſo taught and rul'd that the State, and Church is moſt like to be ſupplied with worthy Perſons, from one Generation to another. Religious Families are the <hi>Nurſeries</hi> for the <hi>Churches of</hi> CHRIST, to ſupply them with worthy Members and <hi>Communicants.</hi> Theſe may be moſt look'd for from praying Houſes. And it is happy for a People when the <hi>State</hi> alſo is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Counſellors</hi> from ſuch Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds; who will be like to be <hi>Patrons</hi> of Religion and <hi>Examples</hi> of it in their Generation.

And the <hi>Bleſſing of</hi> GOD, which makes a People proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, is like to attend a Place for the ſake of ſuch Houſholds. We may bleſs them in the Name of the LORD and ſay, <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>bleſs thee, O Habitation of Righteouſneſs!</hi> As <hi>Godlineſs</hi> has the Promiſe of the Life that now is, ſo the <hi>Remains</hi> of it in a wicked World are very much owing to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Government and good Order of Families. There is the Rice and Foundation of Rule and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the <hi>State,</hi> and ſo of the public Peace and Tranquility.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Unknown is the <hi>Miſchief</hi> and <hi>Woe</hi> to the World, to Church and State, from the <hi>Want</hi> of Family Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Government.

It would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much more than it is, if there were not many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſholds, here and there. Family Worſhip is a mighty Reſtraint upon the Luſts of many, and prevents abundance of Sin. But where Family Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003008_0041_0FEF9D07167680E8"/>ceaſes, the <hi>fountains of the great Deep break</hi> open, and Wickedneſs comes on as a <hi>Flood.</hi> Surely <hi>the fear of</hi> GOD <hi>is not in that Place,</hi> and they live as <hi>without</hi> GOD <hi>and</hi> CHRIST <hi>in the World.</hi> Salvation, in the Means of it, is far from thoſe Houſes, and they count themſelves unworthy of CHRIST'S coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Roof. They ſay to the <hi>Almighty, depart from us;</hi> and Wo unto them if He depart from them.</p>
            <p>Irreligion is propagated from ſuch Houſes, and their <hi>Poſterity</hi> (that come of them) are like to be prayerleſs and graceleſs like their <hi>Anceſtors.</hi> So they become a <hi>Curſe</hi> to the World, and bring down the Wrath of GOD upon the Places where they live.

            <p>If therefore we have any Regard to GOD, to our <hi>own Souls,</hi> to the Souls of our <hi>Houſholds,</hi> and to the Good of the <hi>Places</hi> where we live; to the Weal of <hi>Mankind</hi> and to the Welfare of the <hi>Church of</hi> CHRIST; let us earneſtly come into and be ſtedfaſt, immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and abounding in this great and important Duty of <hi>Family Worſhip.</hi>

How can you ſay that you love, honour or fear GOD if you do not worſhip Him in your Houſholds? Or how can you ſay that you love your <hi>Families,</hi> while you neglect this?
