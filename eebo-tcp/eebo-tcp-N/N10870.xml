            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THOUGHTS UPON SLAVERY.</head>
            <p n="1">1. BY <hi>ſlavery</hi> I mean domeſtic ſlavery, or that of a ſervant to a maſter. A late ingenious writer well obſerves, "The variety of forms in which ſlavery appears, makes it almoſt impoſſible to convey a juſt notion of it, by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition. There are however certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties which have accompanied ſlavery in moſt places, whereby it is eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that mild domeſtic <hi>ſervice</hi> which obtains in our own country <note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Hargrave's</hi> plea for <hi>Somerſet</hi> the negro.</note>."</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Slavery</hi> imports an obligation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſervice, an obligation which only
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013762_0003_0F91A706A8B0C368"/>the conſent of the maſter can diſſolve. Neither in ſome countries can the maſter himſelf diſſolve it, without the conſent of judges appointed by law. It generally gives the maſter an arbitrary power of any correction not affecting life or limb.—Sometimes even theſe are expoſed to his will: or protected only by a fine, or ſome ſlight puniſhment, too inſiconderable to reſtrain a maſter of an harſh temper. It creates an incapacity of acquiring any thing, except for the maſter's benefit. It allows the maſter to alienate the ſlave, in the ſame manner as his cows and horſes. Laſtly, it deſcends in its full extent from parent to child, even to the lateſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The beginning of this may be dated from the remoteſt period, of which we have an account in hiſtory. It commenced in the barbarous ſtate of ſociety, and in proceſs of time ſpread into all nations. It prevailed particularly among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the antient <hi>Germans:</hi> And was tranſmitted by them to the various kingdoms and ſtates, which aroſe out of the ruins of the <hi>Roman</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But after chriſtianity prevailed, it gradually fell into decline in almoſt all parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> This great change began in <hi>Spain,</hi> about the end of the eighth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013762_0004_0F91A7070AE440F8"/>And was become general in moſt other kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> before the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the fourteenth.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From this time ſlavery was nearly extinct, till the commencement of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, when the diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> and of the weſtern and eaſtern coaſts of <hi>Africa,</hi> gave occaſion to the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of it. It took its riſe from the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> who to ſupply the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with men, to cultivate their new poſſeſſions in <hi>America,</hi> procured negroes from <hi>Africa,</hi> whom they ſold for ſlaves to the <hi>American</hi> Spaniards. This began in the year 1508, when they imported the firſt negroes into <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> In 1540 <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, then king of <hi>Spain,</hi> determined to put an end to <hi>negro-ſlavery:</hi> Giving poſitive orders. That all the negro ſlaves in the Spaniſh dominions ſhould be ſet free. And this was accordingly done by <hi>Lagaſca,</hi> whom he ſent and impowered to free them all, on condition of continuing to labour for their maſters. But ſoon after <hi>Lagaſca</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſlavery returned and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed as before. Afterwards other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they acquired poſſeſſions in <hi>America,</hi> followed the examples of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and ſlavery has now taken deep root in moſt of our <hi>American</hi> colonies.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013762_0005_0F91A707C243E138"/>
II. Such is the nature of ſlavery: Such the beginning of negro-ſlavery in <hi>America.</hi> But ſome may deſire to know, what kind of country it is, from which the negroes are brought? What ſort of men, of what temper and behaviour are they in their own country? And in what manner they are generally procured, carried to, and treated in <hi>America?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt, What kind of country is that from whence they are brought? Is it ſo remarkably horrid, dreary and barren, that it is a kindneſs to deliver them out of it? I believe many have apprehended ſo: But it is an entire miſtake, if we may give credit to thoſe who have lived many years therein, and could have no motive to miſrepreſent it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That part of <hi>Africa</hi> whence the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are brought, commonly known by the name of <hi>Guinea,</hi> extends along the coaſt, in the whole, between three and four thouſand miles. From the river <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal,</hi> (ſeventeen degrees north of the line) to Cape <hi>Sierra Leona,</hi> it contains ſeven hundred miles. Thence it runs eaſtward about fifteen hundred miles, including the <hi>Grain-Coaſt,</hi> the <hi>Ivory-Coaſt,</hi> the <hi>Cold-Coaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Slave Coaſt,</hi> with the large king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Benin.</hi> From thence it runs ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, about twelve hundred miles, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013762_0006_0F91A70875186840"/>contains the kingdoms of <hi>Congo</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Concerning the firſt, the <hi>Senegal-Coaſt,</hi> Mons. <hi>Brue,</hi> who lived there ſixteen years, after deſcribing its fruitfulneſs near the ſea, ſays, "The farther you go from the ſea, the more fruitful and well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved is the country, abounding in pulſe, Indian corn, and various fruits. Here are vaſt meadows, which feed large herds of great and ſmall cattle. And the villages which lie thick, ſhew the country is well peopled." And again: "I was ſurprized, to ſee the land ſo well cultivated; ſcarce a ſpot day un-improved: The low lands divided by ſmall canals, were all ſowed with rice: The higher grounds were plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Indian corn, and peas of different ſorts. Their beef is excellent; poultry plenty and very cheap, as are all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life."</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the <hi>Grain</hi> and <hi>Ivory Coaſt,</hi> we learn from eye witneſſes, that the ſoil is in general fertile, producing abundance of rice and roots. Indigo and cotton thrive without cultivation.—Fiſh is in great plenty; the flocks and herds are numerous, and the trees loaded with fruit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Gold-Coaſt</hi> and <hi>Slave-Coaſt,</hi> all who have ſeen it agree, is exceeding fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſant, producing vaſt quantities
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013762_0007_0F91A70A6DE498A0"/>of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm-wine, and oil, and fiſh in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. The very ſame account is given us of the ſoil and produce of the kingdoms of <hi>Benin, Congo</hi> and <hi>Angola.</hi>—From all which it appears, That <hi>Guinea</hi> in general, far from being an horrid, dreary, barren country, is one of the moſt fruitful, as well as the moſt pleaſant countries in the known world. It is ſaid indeed to be unhealthy. And ſo it is to ſtrangers, but perfectly healthy to the native inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Such is the country from which the negroes are brought. We come next to enquire, What ſort of men they are, of what temper and behaviour, not in our plantations, but in their native country. And here likewiſe the ſureſt way is to take our account from eye and ear witneſſes. Now thoſe who have lived in the <hi>Senegal</hi> country obſerve, it is inhabited by three nations, the <hi>Jalofs, Fulis,</hi> and <hi>Mandingos.</hi> The king of the <hi>Jalofs</hi> has under him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral miniſters, who aſſiſt in the exerciſe of juſtice. The chief juſtice goes in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit through all his dominions, to hear complaints and determine controverſies. And the viceroy goes with him, to inſpect the behaviour of the <hi>Alkadi,</hi> or Governor
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013762_0008_0F91A70B05B00630"/>of each village. The <hi>Fulis</hi> are a numerous people; the ſoil of their country repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as rich, affording large harveſts, and the people laborious and good farmers: Of ſome of theſe <hi>Fuli</hi> blacks who dwelt on the river <hi>Gambia, William Moor</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> factor gives a very favourable account.—He ſays, they are governed by their chief men, who rule with much moderation. Few of them will drink any thing ſtronger than water, being ſtrict <hi>Mahometans.</hi> The government is eaſy, becauſe the people are of a good and quiet diſpoſition; and ſo well inſtructed in what is right, that a man who wrongs another is the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all.—They deſire no more land than they uſe, which they cultivate with great care and induſtry: If any of them are known to be made ſlaves by the white men they all join to redeem them. They not only ſupport all that are old, or blind, or lame among themſelves; but have frequently ſupplied the neceſſities of the <hi>Mandingas,</hi> when they were diſtreſt by famine.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The <hi>Mandingos,</hi> ſays Monſ. <hi>Brue,</hi> are rigid <hi>Mahometans,</hi> drinking neither wine nor brandy. They are induſtrious and laborious, keeping their ground well cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and breeding a good ſtock of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Every town has a governor, and he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013762_0009_0F91A70B77A99E58"/>appoints the labour of the people. The men work the ground deſigned for corn; the women and girls, the rice-ground.—He afterwards divides the corn and rice among them: And decides all quarrels if any ariſe. All the Mahometan negroes conſtantly go to public prayers thrice a day: there being a prieſt in every village, who regularly calls them together: Some authors ſay, it is ſurprizing to ſee the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reverence which they obſerve during their worſhip.—Theſe three nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons practiſe ſeveral trades; they have ſmiths, ſadlers, potters and weavers. And they are very ingenious at their ſeveral occupations.—Their ſmiths not only make all the inſtruments of iron, which they have occaſion to uſe, but likewiſe work many things neatly in gold and ſilver. It is chiefly the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who weave ſine cotton cloth, which they dye blue and black.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It was of theſe parts of <hi>Guinea,</hi> that Monſ. <hi>Adanſon,</hi> correſpondent of the royal academy of ſciences at <hi>Paris</hi> from 1749 to 1753, gives the following account, both as to the country and people. "Which way ſoever I turned my eyes, I beheld a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect image of pure nature: An agreeable ſolitude, bounded on every ſide by a charming landſcape; the rural ſituation
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013762_0010_0F91A70EEBE20240"/>of cottages, in the midſt of trees; the eaſe and quietneſs of the negroes, reclined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhade of the ſpreading foliage, with the ſimplicity of their dreſs and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: The whole revived in my mind the idea of our firſt parents, and I ſeemed to contemplate the world in its primitive ſtate. They are generally-ſpeaking, very good natured, ſociable and obliging. I was not a little pleaſed with my very firſt reception, and it fully convinced me, that there ought to be a conſiderable abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made, in the accounts we have of the ſavage character of the <hi>Africans.</hi>" He adds, "It is amazing that an illiterate people ſhould reaſon ſo pertinently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the heavenly bodies. There is no doubt, but that with proper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they would become excellent aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers."</p>
            <p n="9">9. The inhabitants of the <hi>Grain</hi> and <hi>Ivory-Coaſt</hi> are repreſented by thoſe that deal with them, as ſenſible, courteous, and the faireſt traders on the coaſts of <hi>Guinea.</hi> They rarely drink to exceſs: If any do, they are ſeverely puniſhed by the king's order. They are ſeldom troubled with war: If a difference happen between two nations, they commony end the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute amicably.</p>

In particular, the natives of the kingdom of <hi>Whidah</hi> are civil, kind, and obliging to ſtrangers.—And they are the moſt gentleman-like of all the negroes, abounding in good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners towards each other. The inferiors pay great reſpect to their ſuperiors:—So wives to their huſbands, children to their parents. And they are remarkably induſtrious: All are conſtantly employ'd; the men in agriculture, the women in ſpinning and weaving cotton.</p>

They appear likewiſe to have a confuſed appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a future ſtate. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly every town and village has a place of public worſhip.—It is remarkable that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013762_0012_0F91A7100FFA1E50"/>they have no beggars among them: Such is the care of the chief men, in every city and village, to provide ſome eaſy labour, even for the old and weak. Some are employ'd in blowing the ſmiths bellows; others in preſſing palm-oil; others in grinding of colours. If they are too weak even for this, they ſell proviſions in the market.</p>

The accounts we have of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the kingdom of <hi>Benin</hi> is, that they are a reaſonable and good-natured people, ſincere and inoffenſive, and do no injuſtice either to one another or to ſtrangers.—They are civil and courteous: If you make them a preſent, they endeavour to repay it double. And if they are truſted, till the ſhip returns next year, they are ſure honeſtly to pay the whole debt.—Theft is puniſhed among them, altho' not with the ſame ſeverity as murder. If a man and woman of any quality, are taken in adultery, they are certain to be put to death, and their bodies thrown on a dunghill, and left a prey to wild beaſts. They are punctually juſt and honeſt in their dealings; and are alſo very charitable: The king and the great lords taking care to employ all that are capable of any work. And thoſe that are utterly helpleſs they keep for GOD's ſake; ſo that here alſo are

After confirming what is before ſaid he adds, "They ſtarve them to death, with a loaf hanging over their mouths.

                     </gap>) if the horrid pain of ſuch inhuman tortures incline them to rebel." The ſame author gives us extracts of ſome of the laws of <hi>Jamaica</hi> relating to the puniſhment of ſlaves, taken as he ſays, from a general collection of the plantation laws, the printed ſtatutes, or the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary's-office, viz.</p>
                  <p>"If any ſlave by puniſhment from his owner for running away, or other offence, ſuffer in life or limb, none ſhall be liable to the law for the ſame; but whoſoever ſhall kill a ſlave out of wilfulneſs, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, or bloody mindedneſs, ſhall ſuffer three months impriſonment, and pay fifty pounds to the owner of the ſlave. If the party ſo offending be a ſervant, he or ſhe ſhall have on the bare back thirty-nine laſhes, and alſo (after the expiration of the term with his or her maſter or miſtreſs) ſhall ſerve the owner of the deceaſed ſlave the full term of four years. If any perſon kill a ſlave ſtealing or running away, or found by night out of his owner's ground, road, or common path, ſuch perſon ſhall not be ſubject to any damage or action for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>"Thoſe that go out in parties to reduce the negroes, ſhall receive from the treaſurer for every rebellious negro that ſhall be killed, bringing in his head to any juſtice, forty pounds; for every negro taken and brought in alive, and not maimed, ten pounds, to be paid by the owner, who is hereby obliged under the penalty of fifty pounds, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch ſlave ſo taken; and in caſe the owner cannot be found, then the treaſurer ſhall pay the ten pounds, receive the ſlave, ſell and tranſport him, and retain the produce to be employed in the ſaid ſervice."</p>
                  <p>The following advertiſement was taken from one of the <hi>North-Carolina</hi> news papers. "Run-away laſt <hi>November,</hi> from the ſubſcriber, a negro fellow named <hi>Zeb,</hi> about 36 years of age, about 5 feet 8 inches high, a very good cooper by trade &amp;c.—As he is outlawed, I will pay twenty pounds proclamation money out of what the act of aſſembly allows in ſuch caſes, to any perſon who ſhall produce his head ſevered from his body, and five pounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation money if brought home alive."</p>

                     <hi>JOHN MOSLEY.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An advertiſement of the ſame kind was printed in <hi>London,</hi> in the general evening poſt, <hi>Jan</hi> 1, 1774, ſaid to be taken from the <hi>Williamſburgh</hi> gazette, where after deſcribing the negro, the maſter adds, "The ſaid fellow is outlawed, and I will give ten pounds reward for his head ſevered from his body, or forty ſhillings if brought alive." As ſtrange as ſuch publications may appear to ſuch whoſe hearts as are not hardned by the practice of ſlavery, yet I am informed advertiſements of this kind are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the ſouthern colonies.</p>
                  <p>It is alledged by the planters in excuſe for theſe unnatural, theſe monſtrous cruelties, that the greateſt ſeverity, the moſt cruel puniſhments, are abſolutely neceſſary for the management of ſlaves, on account of thoſe train of vices which ſlavery neceſſarily introduces. A late author remarks how ſhocking it is to think that thoſe unhappy victims muſt from the nature of the thing become danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and refactory, in proportion to the greatneſs and generoſity of their minds.</p>
                  <p>Can there be a more dangerous maxim, than that neceſſity is a plea for injuſtice? For who ſhall fix the degree of this neceſſity? What villain ſo atrocious who may not urge this excuſe? or as <hi>Milton</hi> expreſſes it—</p>

                  <p>How many thouſands and tens of thouſands has this dev'liſh plea of neceſſity brought to a cruel and untimely end? What account will in future ſtates of exiſtence, be given to the father of the family of mankind, for the lives of ſo many of our fellow men ſo inhumanly murdered. A particular inſtance of the deſtruction of human beings, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of neceſſity, is related by captain Cook, in his voyage round the world, in company with meſſieurs <hi>Banks</hi> and <hi>Solander,</hi> in the year 1768, being at <hi>Rio Janiero,</hi> one, if not the principal town of <hi>Brazil;</hi> he relates, page 29, "That the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who are very numerous, conſiſts of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, Negroes</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> The townſhip of <hi>Rio Janiero,</hi> which he was told was but a ſmall part of the province, is ſaid to contain thirty-ſeven thouſand white people, and ſix hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-nine thouſand blacks, many of whom are free, in the proportion of ſeventeen to one."</p>
                  <p>Page 34. (he tellsus "The riches of the place conſiſts chiefly in the mines; that much gold is brought from theſe mines, but at an expence of life that muſt ſtrike every man, to whom cuſtom has not made it familiar, with horror. No leſs than forty thouſand <hi>Negroes</hi> are annually imported on the king's account to dig in the mines; and (he adds) we are credibly informed, that the laſt year but one before we arrived here this number fell ſo ſhort, probably from ſome epidemic diſeaſe, that twenty thouſand more were draughted from the town of <hi>Rio Janiero.</hi>"</p>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013762_0026_0F91A71FBAAC4F38"/>few of thoſe Laws for a ſpecimen, and then let any man judge.</p>
            <p>In order to rivet the chain of ſlavery, the law of <hi>Virginia</hi> ordains, "That no
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013762_0027_0F91A720B87D78B8"/>ſlave ſhall be ſet free, upon any pretence whatever, except for ſome meritorious ſervices, to be adjudged and allowed by the <hi>governor and council:</hi> And that where
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013762_0028_0F91A7212F7F1A78"/>any ſlave ſhall be ſet free by his owner, otherwiſe than is herein directed, the church-wardens of the pariſh wherein ſuch negro ſhall reſide for the ſpace of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013762_0029_0F91A721F1E92150"/>one month are hereby authorized and required, to <hi>take up and ſell</hi> the ſaid negro, by <hi>public outcry.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Will not theſe Law-givers take effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual care, to prevent cruelty and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:013762_0030_0F91A723E32D5348"/>
The law of <hi>Jamaica</hi> ordains, "Every ſlave that ſhall run away, and continue abſent from his maſter twelve months, ſhall be <hi>deemed rebellious:</hi>" And by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013762_0031_0F91A72432F06F90"/>law, fifty pounds are allowed, to thoſe who kill or bring in alive a <hi>rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> ſlave." So their law treats theſe poor men with as little ceremony and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as if they were merely brute beaſts! But the innocent blood which is ſhed in conſequence of ſuch a deteſtable law, muſt call for vengeance on the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous abettors and actors of ſuch delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But the law of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> exceeds even this. "If any negro under puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by his maſter, or his order, for running away, or any other crime or miſdemeanor, ſhall ſuffer <hi>in life or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, no perſon whatever ſhall be liable to any fine therefore.</hi> But if any man of WAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TONNESS, or only of BLOODY-MINDED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS or CRUEL INTENTION, <hi>wilfully kill</hi> a negro of his own" (Now obſerve the ſevere puniſhment!) "He ſhall pay into the public treaſury fifteen pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling! And not be liable to any other puniſhment or forfeiture for the ſame!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:013762_0032_0F91A7250E8E6508"/>
Nearly allied to this is that law of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia:</hi> "After proclamation is iſſued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſlaves that run away, it is lawful for any perſon whatſoever to KILL AND DESTROY ſuch ſlaves, by SUCH WAYS AND MEANS AS HE SHALL THINK FIT.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen already ſome of the ways and means which have been <hi>thought fit</hi> on ſuch occaſions. And many more might be mentioned. One gentleman, when I was abroad <hi>thought fit</hi> to roaſt his ſlave alive! But if the moſt natural act of "running away" from intolerable ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, deſerves ſuch relentneſs ſeverity, what puniſhment have theſe <hi>law-makers</hi> to expect hereafter, on account of their own enormous offences?</p>
            <p n="1">IV. 1. This is the plain, un-aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matter of fact. Such is the manner wherein our <hi>African</hi> ſlaves are procured: Such the manner wherein they are remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their native land, and wherein they are treaed in our Plantations. I would now enquire, whether theſe things can be defended, on the principles of even hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then honeſty? Whether they can be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled (ſetting the Bible out of the queſtion) with any degree of either juſtice or mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The grand plea is, "They are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by law." But can law, human law, change the nature of things? Can
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013762_0033_0F91A725E5748428"/>it turn darkneſs into light, or evil into good? By no means. Notwithſtanding ten thouſand laws, right is right, and wrong is wrong ſtill. There muſt ſtill remain an eſſential difference between juſtice and injuſtice, cruelty and mercy. So that ſtill I aſk, Who can reconcile this treatment of the negroes, firſt and laſt, with either mercy or juſtice.</p>
            <p>Where is the juſtice of inflicting the ſevereſt evils, on thoſe that have done us no wrong? Of depriving thoſe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver injured us in word or deed, of every comfort of life? Of tearing them from their native country, and depriving them of liberty itſelf? To which an <hi>Angolan,</hi> has the ſame natural right as an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and on which he ſets as high a value? Yea where is the juſtice of taking away the lives of innocent, inoffenſive men? Murdering thouſands of them in their own land, by the hands of their own countrymen: Many thouſands, year after year, on ſhipboard, and then caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them like dung into the ſea! And tens of thouſands in that cruel ſlavery, to which they are ſo unjuſtly reduced?</p>
            <p n="3">3. But waving, for the preſent, all other conſiderations, I ſtrike at the root of this complicated villainy. I abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny all ſlave-holding to be conſiſtent
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013762_0034_0F91A7289F7BFF60"/>with any degreee of even natural juſtice.</p>
            <p>I cannot place this in a clearer light, than that great ornament of his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, judge <hi>Blackſtone</hi> has already done. Part of his words are as follows:</p>
            <p>"The three origins of the right of ſlavery aſſigned by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> are all built upon falſe foundations. 1. Slavery is ſaid to ariſe from captivity in war. The conqueror having a right to the life of his captive, if he ſpares that, has then a right to deal with him as he pleaſes. But this is untrue, it taken generally, That by the law of nations, a man has a right to kill his enemy. He has only a right to kill him in particular caſes in caſes of abſolute neceſſity for ſelf-defence. And it is plain, this abſolute neceſſity did not ſubſiſt, ſince he did not kill him, but made him priſoner. War itſelf is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable only on principles of ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore it gives us no right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver priſoners, but to hinder their hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us by confining them. Much leſs can it give a right to torture, or kill, or even to enſlave an enemy when the war is over. Since therefore the right of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our priſoners ſlaves, depends on a ſuppoſed right of ſlaughter, that found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation failing, the conſequence which is drawn from it muſt fail likewiſe."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:013762_0035_0F91A728C4B32BB8"/>
"It is ſaid, Secondly, ſlavery may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by one man's ſelling himſelf to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it is true, a man may ſell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to work for another: But he cannot ſell himſelf to be a ſlave, as above defined. Every ſale implies an equivalent given to the ſeller, in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer. But what equivalent can be given for life or liberty? His property likewiſe, with the very price which he ſeems to receive, devolves <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to his maſter, the inſtant he becomes his ſlave: In this caſe therefore the buyer gives nothing, and the ſeller receives nothing. Of what validity then can a ſale be, which deſtroys the very principles upon which all ſales are founded?"</p>
            <p>"We are told, Thirdly, that men may be <hi>born ſlaves,</hi> by being the children of ſlaves. But this being built on the two former rights, muſt fall together with them. If neither captivity, nor contract can by the plain law of nature and reaſon, reduce the parent to a ſtate of ſlavery, much leſs can they reduce the offspring." It clearly follows, that all ſlavery is as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable to juſtice as to mercy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That ſlave-holding is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with mercy, is almoſt too plain to need a proof. Indeed it is ſaid, "That theſe negroes being priſoners of war, our
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013762_0036_0F91A729726A5B58"/>captains and factors buy them merely to ſave them from being put to death. And is not this mercy?" I anſwer, 1. Did Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> and many others, ſeize upon men, women and children, who were at peace in their own fields or houſes, merely to ſave them from death? 2. Was it to ſave them from death, that they knock'd out the brains of thoſe they could not bring away? 3. Who occaſioned and fomented thoſe wars, wherein theſe poor creatures were taken priſoners? Who excited them by money, by drink, by every poſſible means, to fall upon one another? Was it not themſelves? They know in their own conſcience it was, if they have any conſcience left. But 4. To bring the matter to a ſhort iſſue. Can they ſay before GOD, That they ever took a ſingle voyage, or bought a ſingle negro from this motive? They cannot. They well know, to get money, not to ſave lives, was the whole and ſole ſpring of their motions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But if this manner of procuring and treating negroes is not conſiſtent either with mercy or juſtice, yet there is a plea for it which every man of buſineſs will acknowledge to be quite ſufficient. Fifty years ago, one meeting an eminent ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the lobby of the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013762_0037_0F91A72B5F1440C8"/>ſaid, "You have been long talking about juſtice and equity. Pray which is this bill? Equity or juſtice?" He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, very ſhort, and plain, "D—n juſtice: It is neceſſity." Here alſo the ſlave-holder fixes his foot: Here he reſts the ſtrength of his cauſe. "If it is not quite right, yet it <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo: There is an abſolute <hi>neceſſity</hi> for it. It is neceſſary we ſhould procure ſlaves: And when we have procured them, it is neceſſary to uſe them with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, conſidering their ſtupidity, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs and wickedneſs."</p>
            <p>I anſwer, You ſtumble at the threſhold: I deny that villany is ever neceſſary. It is impoſſible that it ſhould ever be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for any reaſonable creature to violate all the laws of juſtice, mercy, and truth. No circumſtances can make it neceſſary for a man to burſt in ſunder all the ties of humanity. It can never be neceſſary for a rational being to ſink himſelf below a brute. A man can be under no neceſſity, of degrading himſelf into a wolf. The abſurdity of the ſuppoſition is ſo glaring, that one would wonder any one can help ſeeing it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This in general. But to be more particular, I aſk, 1. What is neceſſary? And, ſecondly, To what end? It may be be anſwered, "The whole method now
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013762_0038_0F91A72BB92F38A0"/>uſed by the original purchaſers of negroes, is neceſſary to the furniſhing our colonies yearly with an hundred thouſand ſlaves." I grant, this is neceſſary to that end. But how is that end neceſſary? How will you prove it neceſſary, that one hundred, that one of thoſe ſlaves ſhould be procured? "Why, it is neceſſary to my gaining an hundred thouſand pounds." Perhaps ſo: But how is <hi>this</hi> neceſſary? It is very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you might be both a better and an happier man, if you had not a quarter of it. I deny that your gaining one thouſand is neceſſary, either to your preſent or eternal happineſs. "But however you muſt allow, theſe ſlaves are neceſſary for the cultivation of our iſlands; inaſmuch as white men are not able to labour in hot climates <note n="†" place="bottom">It is not propoſed to remove the negroes from labouring in the ſeveral provinces and iſlands where they are now employed; in order to employ white men in their ſtead, what is propoſed, is only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any farther import of negroes, except thoſe who may come voluntarily and in a free condition; and to fall upon ſuch juſt regulations and proper encouragement with reſpect to thoſe already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that from dangerous grudging ſlaves, they may become willing hearted labourers, who having an intereſt in the peace and welfare of the country, will be parties in its ſtrength and ſupport. But whilſt deficiencies by the death of the labouring ſlaves can be ſo eaſily made up by the continual freſh imports from <hi>Guinea,</hi> and the planters find it cheaper to make new purchaſes than to raiſe the children, or ſpare and cheriſh the parents of thoſe already in their ſervice, little amendment can be expected in the hardſhip they are put to, and the cruelties exerciſed upon them. Surely the number already in our colonies and iſlands, which on a calculation made four or five years paſt, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eight and nine hundred thouſand, beſides that there has' been a vaſt number, ſaid to be about an hundred thouſand ſince yearly imported: all theſe, with their increaſe, if well uſed, would certainly be ſufficient to perform all neceſſary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
<p>If an end was put to the import of negroes, and the odious and cruel diſtinction of maſter and ſlaves, with all its attendant horrors ſhould ceaſe, many labouring people from <hi>Europe,</hi> who are now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from an apprenſion of being put on a level with ſlaves, would probably be willing to come ever and engage in the ſervice.</p>

                     <hi>John Miller,</hi> profeſſor of law at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> in his late <hi>obſervations concerning diſtinction of ranks in ſociety,</hi> obſerves, "That the ſlavery eſtabliſhed in our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies is an object of great importance, and is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with difficulties which cannot be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. It has been thought that the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our plantations requires a labour in which free men would not be willing to engage, and which the white people are from their conſtitution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of performing. How far this opinion is well founded according to the preſent maimer of labouring in that part of the world, ſeems difficult to determine, as it has never been properly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who are in a condition to aſcertain the facts in queſtion. But there is ground to believe, that the inſtitution of ſlavery is the chief circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that has prevented thoſe contrivances to ſhorten and facilitate the more laborious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the people, which takes place in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where freedom has been introduced. With regard to the planting of ſugar, experiments have been made in ſome of the iſlands, from which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in ſome ſpecies of cultivation, cattle might be employed with advantage, and that the number of ſlaves might be greatly diminiſhed. But theſe experiments have been little regarded, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the former uſage, and in oppoſition to a lucrative branch of trade which theſe innovaſions would in a great meaſure deſtroy. At any rate, the intereſt of our colonies ſeems to demand, that the negroes ſhould be better treated, and even that they ſhould be raiſed to a better condition—The author of a late elegant account of our <hi>American</hi> ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has propoſed, that ſmall wages ſhould be given them, as an encouragement to induſtry. If this meaſure were once begun, it is probable that the maſter would ſoon find the utility of puſhing it to a greater extent. Nothing can appear more aſtoniſhing than the little attention that has hitherto been paid to any improvement of this nature, after the good effects of them have been ſo fully illuſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the caſe of the villains in <hi>Euroſe.</hi> At the ſame time, it affords a curious ſpectacle to obſerve, that the ſame people who talk in ſo high a ſtrain of political liberty, and who conſider the privilege of impoſing their own taxes, as one of the unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights of mankind, ſhould make no ſcruple of reducing a great proportion of the inhabitants into circumſtances by which they are not only deprived of property, but almoſt of every right whatſoever. Fortune, perhaps never produced a ſituation more calculated to ridicule a grave and even a liberal hypotheſis, or to ſhow how little the conduct of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> is at bottom directed by any philoſophical principles."</p>
                  <p>We have accounts from <hi>England</hi> of ſome regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have taken place in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> colonies, which do the <hi>Spaniards</hi> much honour, and are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly worthy our imitation; they are to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect:—"As ſoon as a ſlave is landed, his name, price, &amp;c. are regiſtered in a public regiſter, and the maſter is obliged by law, to allow him <hi>one working day</hi> in every week to himſelf, beſides ſundays: ſo that if the ſlave chuſes to work for his maſter on that day, he receives the wages of a freeman for it; and whatever he gains by his labour on that day, is ſo ſecured to him by law, that the maſter cannot deprive him of it. As ſoon as the ſlave is able to purchaſe <hi>another working day,</hi> the maſter is obliged to ſell it to him at a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able price, viz. one fifth part of his original coſt, and ſo likewiſe the remaining four days at the ſame rate, as ſoon as the ſlave is able to redeem them; after which <hi>he is abſolutely free.</hi>" This is ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to induſtry, that even the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent would be tempted to exert themſelves. Men who have thus worked out their freedom, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to the labour of the country and are certainly the moſt uſeful ſubjects that a colony can acquire.</p>
               </note>." I anſwer, 1. It were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013762_0039_0F91A72C7022D870"/>that all thoſe iſlands ſhould remain uncultivated for ever, yea, it were more deſirable that they were all together ſunk in the depth of the ſea, than that they ſhould be cultivated at ſo high a price, as the violation of juſtice, mercy, and truth. But, Secondly, the ſuppoſition on which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013762_0040_0F91A72D2DCEC6B0"/>you ground your argument is falſe. For white men, even <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> are well able to labour in hot climates: provided they are temperate both in meat and drink, and that they inure themſelves to it by degrees. I ſpeak no more than I know by experience. It appears from the ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013762_0041_0F91A7305542DB18"/>that the ſummer heat in <hi>Georgia,</hi> is frequently equal to that in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> yea to that under the line. And yet I and my family, (eight in number) did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all our ſpare time there, in felling of trees and clearing of ground, as hard labour as any negro need be employed in. The <hi>German</hi> family likewiſe, forty in number,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013762_0042_0F91A7316DF4C928"/>were employed in all manner of labour. And this was ſo far from impairing our health, that we all continued perfectly well, while the idle ones all round about us, were ſwept away as with a peſtilence. It is not true therefore that white men are not able to labour, even in hot climates, full as well as black. But if they were not, it would be better that none ſhould
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013762_0043_0F91A731B4B410C0"/>labour there, that the work ſhould be left undone, than that myriads of innocent men ſhould be murdered, and myriads more dragged into the baſeſt ſlavery.</p>
            <p n="7">7. "But the furniſhing us with ſlaves is neceſſary, for the trade, and wealth, and glory of our nation:" Here are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral miſtakes. For 1. Wealth is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the glory of any nation; but wiſdom, virtue, juſtice, mercy, generoſity, public ſpirit, love of our country. Theſe are neceſſary to the real glory of a nation; but abundance of wealth is not. Men of underſtanding allow, that the glory of <hi>England</hi> was full as high in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s time as it is now: Although our riches and trade were then as much ſmaller, as our virtue was greater<note n="‡" place="bottom">We are told in <hi>Hill's</hi> naval hiſtory, page 239, That when captain <hi>Hawkins</hi> returned from his firſt voyage to <hi>Africa,</hi> he was ſent for by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who expreſſed her concern to him, leſt any of the <hi>African</hi> negroes ſhould be carried off without their free conſent, <hi>declaring it would be deteſtable, and call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertakers.</hi>—Captain <hi>Hawkins</hi> promiſed to comply with the Queen's injunction, but acted quite contrary to his promiſe, which occaſioned that author to remark, "That here began the horrid practice of forcing the <hi>Africans</hi> into ſlavery, an injuſtice and barbarity which ſo ſure as there is vengeance in heaven for the worſt of crimes, will ſometime be the deſtruction of all who act, or who encourage it."
<p>
                     <hi>Geraldus Cambrenſis,</hi> a noted author who lived about ſix hundred years paſt, in his obſervations concerning the cauſes of the proſperity of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> undertakings in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when they conquered that iſland, tells us, "That a ſynod or council of the clergy being then aſſembled at <hi>Armagh,</hi> and that point fully debated, it was unanimouſly agreed, that the ſins of the people were the occaſion of that heavy judgment then fallen upon their nation; and that eſpecially their buying of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> from merchants and pirates, and detaining them under moſt miſerable hard bondage, had cauſed the <hi>Lord</hi> by way of juſt retaliation, to leave them to be reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the ſame ſlate of ſlavery; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they made a public act in that council, that all the <hi>English</hi> held in captivity throughout the whole land ſhould be preſently reſtored to their former liberty."</p>
               </note>. But,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013762_0044_0F91A732780293C8"/>Secondly, it is not clear, that we ſhould have either leſs money or trade, (only leſs of that deteſtable trade of man-ſtealing) if there was not a negro in all our iſlands, or in all <hi>Engliſh America.</hi> It is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, white men, inured to it by degrees <hi>can</hi> work as well as them: And they <hi>would</hi> do it, were negroes out of the way, and proper encouragement given them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Thirdly, I come back to the ſame point; better no<hi rend="sup">o</hi> trade, than trade pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by villany. It is far better to have
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013762_0045_0F91A733301F4A48"/>no wealth, than to gain wealth, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of virtue. Better is honeſt poverty, than all the riches bought by the tears, and ſweat, and blood of our fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p n="8">8. "However this be, it is neceſſary when we have ſlaves, to uſe them with ſeverity." What, to whip them for every petty offence, till they are all in gore blood? To take that opportunity, of rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing pepper and ſalt into their raw ſleſh? To drop burning ſealing wax upon their ſkin? To caſtrate them? To cut off half their foot with an axe? To hang them on gibbets, that they may die by inches, with heat, and hunger, and thirſt? To pin them down to the ground, and then burn them by degrees, from the feet, to the head? To roaſt them alive? When did a Turk or a Heathen find it neceſſary to uſe a fellow-creature thus?</p>
            <p>I pray, to what end is this uſage neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary? "Why, to prevent their running away: And to keep them conſtantly to their labour, that they may not idle away their time. So miſerably ſtupid is this race of men, yea, ſo ſtubborn, and ſo wicked." Allowing them to be as ſtupid as you ſay, to whom is that ſtupidity owing? Without queſtion it lies altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the door of their inhuman maſters:
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013762_0046_0F91A73406D0B0A0"/>Who give them no means, no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of improving their underſtanding: And indeed leave them no motive, either from hope or fear, to attempt any ſuch thing. They were no way remarkable for ſtupidity, while they remained in their own country: The inhabitants of <hi>Africa</hi> where they have equal motives and equal means of improvement, are not inferior to the inhabitants of <hi>Europe:</hi> To ſome of them they are greatly ſuperior. Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially ſurvey in their own country, the natives of <hi>Benin</hi> and the natives of <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Compare, (ſetting prejudice aſide) the <hi>Samoeids</hi> and the <hi>Angolans.</hi> And on which ſide does the advantage lie, in point of underſtanding? Certainly the <hi>African</hi> is in no reſpect inferior to the <hi>European.</hi>—Their ſtupidity therefore in our planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is not natural; otherwiſe than it is the natural effect of their condition.—Conſequently it is not their fault, but <hi>your's:</hi> You muſt anſwer for it, before GOD and man.</p>
            <p n="9">9. "But their ſtupidity is not the only reaſon of our treating them with ſeverity. For it is hard to ſay, which is the greateſt, This, or their ſtubbornneſs and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."—It may be ſo:—But do not theſe, as well as the other, lie at <hi>your</hi> door? Are not ſtubbornneſs, cunning, pilfering, and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013762_0047_0F91A734EB4D9DF8"/>divers others vices, the natural, neceſſary fruits of ſlavery? Is not this an obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which has been made, in every age and nation.—And what means have you uſed to remove this ſtubbornneſs? Have you tried what mildneſs and gentleneſs would do? I knew one that did: That had prudence and patience to make the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment: Mr. <hi>Hugh Bryan,</hi> who then lived on the borders of <hi>South-Carolina.</hi>—And what was the effect? Why, that all his negroes (And he had no ſmall number of them) loved and reverenced him as a father, and chearfully obeyed him out of love. Yea, they were more afraid of a frown from <hi>him,</hi> than of many blows from an overſeer. And what pains have <hi>you</hi> taken, what method have you uſed, to reclaim them from their wickedneſs? Have you carefully taught them, "That there is a GOD, a wiſe, powerful, merciful Being, the Creator and Governor of Heaven and Earth? That he has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a day wherein he will judge the world, will take an account of all our thoughts, words and actions? That in that day he will reward every child of man according to his works: That "then the righteous ſhall inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world: And the wicked ſhall be caſt into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013762_0048_0F91A7356DE11630"/>fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." If you have not done this, if you have taken no pains or thought about the matter, can you wonder at their wickedneſs? What wonder, if they ſhould out your throat? And if they did, whom could you thank for it but yourſelf? You firſt acted the villain in making them ſlaves, (whether you ſtole them or bought them.) You kept them ſtupid and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by cutting them off from all appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of improving either in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or virtue: And now you aſſign their want of wiſdom and goodneſs as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for uſing them worſe than brute beaſts!</p>
            <p n="1">V. 1. It remains only, to make a little application, of the preceding obſervations.—But to whom ſhould that application be made? That may bear a queſtion. Should we addreſs ourſelves to the public at large? What effect can this have? It may inflame the world againſt the guilty, but is not likely to remove that guilt. Should we appeal to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation in general? This alſo is ſtriking wide: And is never likely to procure any redreſs, for the fore evil we complain of.—As little would it in all probability avail, to apply to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. So many things, which <hi>ſeem</hi> of greater importance lie before them that
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013762_0049_0F91A738B02C5238"/>they are not likely to attend to this. I therefore add a few words to thoſe who are more immediately concerned, whether captains, merchants or planters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And, firſt, to the captains employed in this trade. Moſt of <hi>you</hi> know, the country of <hi>Guinea:</hi> Several parts of it at leaſt, between the river <hi>Sonegal</hi> and the kingdom of <hi>Angola.</hi> Perhaps now, by <hi>your</hi> means, part of it is become a dreary uncultivated wilderneſs, the inhabitants being all murdered or carried away, ſo that there are none left to till the ground. But you well know, how populous, how fruitful, how pleaſant it was a few years ago. You know the people were not ſtupid, not wanting in ſenſe, conſidering the few means of improvement they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Neither did you find them ſavage, fierce, cruel, treacherous, or unkind to ſtrangers. On the contrary, they were in moſt parts a ſenſible and ingenious people. They were kind and friendly, courteous and obliging, and remarkably fair and juſt in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, to tear away from this lovely country; part by ſtealth, part by force, part made captives in thoſe wars, which you raiſe or foment on purpoſe. You have ſeen them torn away, children from
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013762_0050_0F91A73A9EF38DB0"/>their parents, parents from their children: Huſbands from their wives, wives from their beloved huſbands, brethren and ſiſters from each other. You have drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them who had never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſhore. You have forced them into your ſhips like an herd of ſwine, them who had ſouls immortal as your own: (Only ſome of them have leaped into the ſea, and reſolutely ſtayed under water, till they could ſuffer no more from you.) You have ſtowed them together as cloſe as ever they could lie, without any regard either to decency or convenience.—And when many of them had been poiſoned by foul air, or had ſunk under various hardſhips, you have ſeen their remains delivered to the deep, till the ſea ſhould give up his dead. You have carried the ſurvivors into the vileſt ſlavery, never to end but with life: Such ſlavery as is not found among the <hi>Turks</hi> at <hi>Algiers,</hi> no, nor among the heathens in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. May I ſpeak plainly to you? I muſt. Love conſtrains me: Love to <hi>you,</hi> as well as to thoſe you are concerned with.</p>
            <p>Is there a GOD? You know there is. Is He a juſt GOD? Then there muſt be a ſtate of retribution: A ſtate wherein the juſt GOD will reward every man according to
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013762_0051_0F91A73AC2CD6C28"/>his works. Then what reward will he render to <hi>you?</hi> O think betimes! Before you drop into eternity! Think now, <hi>He ſhall have judgment without mercy, that ſhewed no mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are you <hi>a man?</hi> Then you ſhould have an <hi>human</hi> heart. But have you indeed? What is your heart made of? Is there no ſuch principle as compaſſion there? Do you never <hi>feel</hi> another's pain? Have you no ſympathy? No ſenſe of human woe? No pity for the miſerable? When you ſaw the flowing eyes, the heaving breaſts, or the bleeding ſides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures, was you a ſtone, or a brute? Did you look upon them with the eyes of a tiger? When you ſqueezed the agonizing creatures down in the ſhip, or when you threw their poor mangled remains into the ſea, had you no relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Did not one tear drop from your eye, one ſigh eſcape from your breaſt? Do you feel no relenting <hi>now?</hi> If you do not, you muſt go on, till the meaſure of your iniquities is full. Then will the great GOD deal with <hi>you,</hi> as you have dealt with <hi>them,</hi> and require all their blood at your hands. And at that day it ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Comorrah</hi> than for <hi>you!</hi> But if your heart does relent, though in a ſmall degree, know it is a call from
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013762_0052_0F91A73BD2158828"/>the GOD of love. And to day, if you hear his voice, harden not your heart.—To day reſolve, GOD being your helper, to eſcape for your life.—Regard not money! All that a man hath will he give for his life? Whatever you loſe, loſe not your ſoul: nothing can countervail that loſs. Immediately quit the horrid trade: At all events, be an honeſt man.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This equally concerns every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who is engaged in the ſlave-trade. It is <hi>you</hi> that induce the <hi>African</hi> villain, to ſell his countrymen; and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to ſteal, rob, murder men, women and children without number: By enabling the <hi>Engliſh</hi> villain to pay him for ſo doing; whom you over pay for his execrable labour. It is <hi>your</hi> money, that is the ſpring of all, that impowers him to go on: So that whatever he or the <hi>African</hi> does in this matter, is all <hi>your</hi> act and deed. And is your conſcience quite reconciled to this? Does it never reproach you at all? Has gold entirely blinded your eyes, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſied your heart? Can you ſee, can you <hi>feel</hi> no harm therein? Is it doing as you would be done to? Make the caſe your own. "Maſter, (ſaid a ſlave at <hi>Liverpool</hi> to the merchant that owned him) "what if ſome of my countrymen were to come here, and take away my miſtreſs, and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013762_0053_0F91A73C35B69C40"/>
               <hi>Tommy,</hi> and maſter <hi>Billy,</hi> and carry them into our country, and make them ſlaves, how would you like it?" His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was worthy of a man: "I will never buy a ſlave more while I live." O let his reſolution be yours! Have no more any part in this deteſtable buſineſs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly leave it to thoſe unfeeling wretches, "Who laugh at human nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion!" Be <hi>you</hi> a man! Not a wolf, a devourer of the human ſpecies! Be merciful, that you may obtain mercy!</p>
            <p n="5">5. And this equally concerns every gentleman that has an eſtate in our <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> plantations: Yea all ſlave-holders of whatever rank and degree; ſeeing <hi>men-buyers</hi> are exactly on a level with <hi>men-ſtealers.</hi> Indeed you ſay, "I pay honeſtly for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> goods: and I am not concerned to know how they are come by." Nay, but you are: You are deeply concerned, to know they are honeſtly come by. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you are partaker with a thief, and are not a jot honeſter than him. But you know, they are not honeſtly come by: You know they are procured by means, nothing near ſo innocent as picking of pockets, houſe-breaking, or robbery upon the highway. You know they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by a deliberate ſeries of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated villany, of fraud, robbery and
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:013762_0054_0F91A73CF231F1F0"/>murder) than was ever practiſed either by <hi>Mahometans</hi> or <hi>Pagans:</hi> in particular by murders, of all kinds; by the blood of the innocent poured upon the ground like water. Now it is <hi>your</hi> money that pays the merchant, and thro' him the captain, and the <hi>African</hi> butchers. <hi>You</hi> therefore are guilty, yea, principally guilty, of all theſe frauds, robberies and murders. You are the ſpring that puts all the reſt in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they would not ſtir a ſtep without <hi>you:</hi>—Therefore the blood of all theſe wretches, who die before their time, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their country, or elſewhere lies upon <hi>your</hi> head. <hi>The blood of thy brother,</hi> (for, whether thou wilt believe it or no, ſuch he is in the ſight of him that made him) <hi>crieth againſt thee from the earth,</hi> from the ſhip, and from the waters. O, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſts, put a ſtop to its cry before it be too late. Inſtantly, at any price, were it the half of your goods, deliver thyſelf from blood-guiltineſs! Thy hands, thy bed, thy ſurniture, thy houſe, thy lands are at preſent ſtained with blood. Surely it is enough; accumulate no more guilt: ſpill no more the blood of the innocent! Do not hire another to ſhed blood: Do not pay him for doing it! Whether you are a chriſtian or no, ſhew yourſelf a man; be not more ſavage than a lion or a bear!</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:013762_0055_0F91A73DB016BAE0"/>
6. Perhaps you will ſay, "I do not <hi>buy</hi> any negroes: I only <hi>uſe</hi> thoſe left me by my father."—So far is well: but is it enough to ſatisfy your own conſcience? Had your father, have <hi>you,</hi> has any man living, a right to uſe another as a ſlave? It cannot be, even ſetting revelation aſide. It cannot be, that either war, or contract, can give any man ſuch a property in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he has in his ſheep and oxen. Much leſs is it poſſible, that any child of man, ſhould ever be <hi>born a ſlave.</hi> Liberty is the right of every human creature, as ſoon as he breathes the vital air. And no human law can deprive him of that right, which he derives from the law of nature.</p>
            <p>If therefore you have any regard to juſtice, (to ſay nothing of mercy, nor of the revealed law of GOD) render unto all their due. Give liberty to whom liberty is due, that is to every child of man, to every partaker of human nature. Let none ſerve you but by his own act and deed, by his own voluntary choice.—Away with all whips, all chains, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion! Be gentie towards all men. And ſee that you invariably do unto every one, as you would he ſhould do unto <hi>you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. O thou GOD of love, thou who art loving to every man, and whoſe mercy is over all thy works: Thou who art the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013762_0056_0F91A73EBB44BEA8"/>father of the ſpirits of all fleſh, and who art rich in mercy unto all: Thou who haſt mingled of one blood, all the nations upon earth: Have compaſſion upon theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts of men, who are trodden down as dung upon the earth!

            <p>SIMILAR cauſes will produce ſimilar effects; the dreadful conſequence of ſlavery is the ſame amongſt every people and in every nation where it prevails: this truth is veriſied in the following accounts of the inhuman treatment the negroes met with both from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is taken from the late writings of <hi>Edward Bancroft,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> phyſician, who reſided ſome years in that part of <hi>America,</hi> called <hi>Dutch Guiana,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the ſeveral ſettlements of <hi>Surinam, Barbices, Demarara,</hi> &amp;c. The inſenſibility with which this author relates and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates the cruelties and indignities ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> on the miſerable <hi>Africans,</hi> ſhew that the advantage accruing to him from the labour of the ſlaves, as well as his connection with their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, had its uſual and natural effects, in obſcuring his underſtanding, and hardning his heart againſt the dictates of reaſon and humanity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:013762_0058_0F91A743B471B090"/>
The <hi>French</hi> author appears to have been in a very different ſituation; he was an officer belonging to the troops quartered in the iſland <hi>Mauritus,</hi> now called <hi>The Iſle of France,</hi> who not reaping any advantage from the labour of the ſlaves, nor having any dependence on the planters, his mind remained ſo unprejudiced, that the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of reaſon and tender feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, had free liberty to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Bancroft,</hi> whilſt he is giving his readers a genuine relation of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious oppreſſion and cruelty exerciſed on the negroes, advances ſuch arguments in defence of the practice of ſlavery, as are, indeed, a diſhonour to reaſon, and ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to humanity. He tells us, <q>That the labour of the country is almoſt wholly performed by negroes—that they are kept at a ſubmiſſive and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtance, by ſeverity of diſcipline,</q> which he is ſo hardned as to ſay, <q>not only contributes to the ſafety of the white inhabitants, but even the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſlaves, becauſe, adds he, the impoſſibility of attaining is ever found to deſtroy the deſire of enjoyment, and rigid treatment, by annihilating every hope of liberty, renders the ſlaves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the enjoyment of ſlavery.</q>—He
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013762_0059_0F91A744C9883F20"/>acknowledges, <q>That the negroes are indeed ſpurred to induſtry by the whip of correction, which is ever at their heels, and not ſparingly exerciſed; but, that there is no medium: either the minds of the ſlaves muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by abject ſlavery, or the lives of the maſters are in imminent danger: For this reaſon (he ſays) they have been oppreſſed by many humiliating penalties and diſtinctions. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſlaves relating to white perſons are of no validity. An attempt to ſtrike a white inhabitant is puniſhed with death. Their maſters or overſeers have not only the power of inflicting cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment, but are in ſome meaſure allowed to exerciſe a right over their lives, ſince the putting a negro to death is attended only with a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary puniſhment. In which ſituation, he confeſſes, they are ſubject to many complicated ſpecies of miſery, expoſed to the tyranny of the imperious, and luſt of the libidinous; and to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant toil which will have no period but with their lives.</q> Thus this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor thro' the whole of his reaſoning, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſhews the depraving effect which the ſight and practice of thoſe bard and cruel meaſures which are attendant on
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013762_0060_0F91A7452FAC73D8"/>ſlavery, has upon the heart and reaſon of men, otherwiſe of good judgment.—Hence he adds, <q>That tho' this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has the appearance of cruelty, and cannot be reconciled to the principles of juſtice and equity, yet many things which are repugnant to humanity, may be excuſed on account of their neceſſity and for ſelf-preſervation.</q>—Speaking of the proviſion made for the negroes in food and cloathing, he ſays, <q>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of maintaining them in this climate is very trifling—they are aſſigned a piece of ground, from this the ſlave is ſupplied with a ſufficient ſtock for his ſuſtenance; on which however he is not allowed to labour but only on ſundays; receiving from his maſter a weekly allowance of dried fiſh to the amount of a pound and an half; which is all that his maſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes towards his food. The females receive the ſame treatment, and the drink of both is nothing but water: yet from this water and vegetables, with a morſel of dried fiſh, theſe people derive ſufficient nutriment to ſuſtain the hardeſt labour in the moſt enervat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing climate. The cloathing of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes (who work in the fields) is ſcarce ſufficient to anſwer the demands of
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013762_0061_0F91A745F3132648"/>modeſty. If any of them have either ſhirts, breeches, or petticoats, they are the produce of their private induſtry, as their maſters furniſh only a piece of coarſe blue or brown linen, which is applied to the middle, in both ſexes, and a blanket with which the ſlave covers himſelf at night; ſleeping on boards only.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The account given by the <hi>French</hi> officer of the diſpoſition of the blacks, and the treatment they received from his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen on the iſland <hi>Mauritius,</hi> is as affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the former, tho' apparently wrote from a different motive and in a quite different ſpirit. He informs us, that the ſlaves who are employed in the cultivation of that iſland, are brought chiefly from the iſland <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> ſituate about two hundred leagues diſtance.</p>
            <p>"That theſe black men, whoſe features bear a nearer ſimilitude to the <hi>Europeans</hi> than the negroes of <hi>Guinea,</hi> are handy, intelligent, and ſenſible of honour: In their own country they apply themſelves to many little handicrafts with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; they are paſſionately fond of dancing and muſic; their inſtrument is a kind of bow, to which a calibaſh is fixed; from which they draw a ſoft kind of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, accompanied with ſongs of their
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013762_0062_0F91A746B229F310"/>own compoſition. Love is always the ſubject. The girls dance to the ſong of their lovers; the ſpectators beat time.—Theſe poor people in their own country are extremely hoſpitable: when a black in <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> is on his journey, he goes into the firſt houſe that ſuits his exigency, and tho' unknown, the family ſhare their proviſions with him. He is neither aſked whence he comes nor whither he goes: it is the cuſtom of the country. With ſuch arts and ſuch manners theſe black people are brought to the iſland <hi>Mauritius</hi> to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the whites. They are ſet on ſhore quite naked, except a rag that covers their loins; the men are ranged on one ſide and the women on the other, with their little children, who cling about the mother thro' fear. The planter examines the whole, and purchaſes ſuch as ſuits him. Brothers, ſiſters, friends, lovers, are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; they take leave of each other with tears, and depart for the plantation. Theſe blacks are naturally of a joyous temper; but after ſome years of ſlavery they grow melancholy.—The treatment they receive from their maſters is rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: at day break, three cracks of the whip are the ſignal that calls them to work: each ſlave appears in the plantation with their mattock; here they work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:013762_0063_0F91A747AC1B6990"/>naked in the heat of the ſun. For the leaſt neglect they are bound hand and feet on a ladder; their commander arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a poſtillions whip ſtands over them, and gives them on their naked poſteriors fifty, an hundred, or two hundred laſhes. Every laſh brings off the ſkin. The poor wretch covered with blood, is let looſe, and dragged back to his work. Some of theſe miſerable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on being thus chaſtiſed, are not able to ſit down for a month after. The women are puniſhed in the ſame manner. There is a law made by the <hi>French</hi> king in their favour, called the black code: this law ordains that at each puniſhment they ſhall receive no more than thirty laſhes; that they ſhall not be obliged to work on ſundays; that they ſhall have their proviſion weekly, and their ſhirts yearly: but this law is not obſerved. Sometimes when they grow old, they are turned adrift to get their living as they can. One day I ſaw one of them who was nothing but ſkin and bone cutting fleſh from a dead horſe to eat. It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be one ſkeleton devouring another.—They have occaſionally the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religion propoſed to them, and are from time to time baptiſed. They are told that they are made brethren of the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:013762_0064_0F91A7499A927998"/>whites, and ſhall go to heaven; but they hardly know how to believe the <hi>Europeans</hi> ſhould conduct them to heaven, whilſt they are, they ſay, the cauſe of all their ſufferings on earth.—They frequently refuſe us, ſay they, neceſſary meat and cloaths, and beat us cruelly without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: of this I have ſeen many inſtances. A ſlave, almoſt white, threw herſelf one day at my feet; her miſtreſs made her riſe early and watch late: if ſhe chanced to ſleep, ſhe rubbed her mouth with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: and if ſhe did not lick her lips, ſhe commanded her to be whipt; ſhe begged of me to ſolicit her pardon, which ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Sometimes the maſters of theſe wretches grant ſuch requeſt, and within two days double their puniſhment, reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning in tale of laſhes what they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly forgiven. A counſellor of whom ſome blacks had complained to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, aſſured me, that tho' they were exempted from puniſhment that day, the next he would have them ſlead from head to foot.—In ſhort, when thoſe wretched creatures can no longer ſupport their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they ſink into deſpair. Some of them put a period to their lives by poiſon or the halter: others throw themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome petty boat, without ſails, without compaſs, without proviſion: in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:013762_0065_0F91A749C0812E50"/>they hazard a paſſage of two hundred leagues to return to the Iſland of <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſcar,</hi> from whence they were brought. I have known them land there, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and returned to their maſters. In general they take refuge in the woods where they are hunted by detachments of ſoldiers, negroes, and dogs. Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there are who make on ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a party of pleaſure. They are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with the ſpear, like wild beaſts. When they cannot be reached this way they are ſhot. Their heads are cut off and carried in triumph to town on the end of a pole. This is what I have ſeen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt weekly—I have ſeen them hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and broke alive, they went to their puniſhment with pleaſure and ſupported it without complaint. I have ſeen a woman throw herſelf voluntarily from the ladder. They cry <hi>that in another world they ſhall find a happier life, and that the father of mankind is not ſo unjuſt as man</hi>—I have <hi>daily</hi> beheld men and women whipt in the manner before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for having broken a pot, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to ſhut a gate, their bloody limbs afterwards rubbed with vinegar and ſalt to heal them.—I have ſeen them in the exceſs of their anguiſh unable to cry any longer.—I have ſeen them
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:013762_0066_0F91A74A78657060"/>bite the cannon on which they were bound.—I ſicken at the recital of theſe horrors.—My eyes ach with ſeeing them.—My ears with hearing them. Here I ſee poor negro women bending o'er their ſpades, their naked children bound upon their backs: Miſerable creatures that tremble as they paſs before me.—Sometimes I hear the ſound of their drum, but more frequently the ſound of whips cracking in the air like the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a piſtol; and the heart rending cries of <hi>mercy, maſter mercy.</hi>—If the unfortunate creatures would complain that the laws in their favour are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to whom can they complain; their judges are often their greateſt tyrants (witneſs the counſellor before mentioned) It is alleged that without this ſeverity, it is impoſſible to manage the ſlaves, you muſt have puniſhments and pains, iron collars with braces, whips, blocks to bind them by the foot, and chains to go round their necks. They muſt in ſhort be treated like beaſts, that the whites may live like men. Can we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at reaſoning like this? <q>Where there is injuſtice in the principle, there muſt be inhumanity in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</q>

I am mortified when I think that thoſe philoſophers, who have ſhewn ſo much fortitude in their attacks of moral and religious abuſes, have not mentioned the poor negroes—They turn from the view of their misfortunes, they talk of the maſſacre of the Mexicans by the Spaniards, as if that crime were not the guilt of their own days; a guilt in which half Europe is concerned. Is it a greater crime at once to aſſaſſinate a people who differ from us in opinion, than to hold in living torments, a race of men who labour for the gratification of our palates and appetites, our internal and external luxuries?"</p>
            <p>If it is alledged in anſwer to theſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, that ſuch cruelties may indeed be practiſed by the Hollanders and French, but that they are ſeldom uſed amongſt the Engliſh, to this it may, with truth, be replied, that tho' different circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may occaſion a variation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in different places, yet there is in effect but little difference; wherever ſlavery is practiſed, and an unlawful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of gain prevails, it will have its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effect, it will harden the heart, and induce to the uſe of hard and cruel mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to obtain the end propoſed. Its
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013762_0068_0F91A74EC0E20360"/>generally thought that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> exerciſe a greater degree of rigour and cruelty towards their ſlaves, than the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Nevertheleſs our nation is in ſome caſes ſaid to exceed the former. An Inſtance of this is related by Captain <hi>Cook</hi> before mentioned, who on his return in his voyage round the world, at page 797. when at the Iſland St. <hi>Helena's,</hi> belonging to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> tells us, <q>that the negro-ſlaves are very numerous in that iſland.—That they appear to be a miſerable race, worn out by exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive labour, and partly by ill uſage, of which they frequently complain,</q> he adds, I am very ſorry to ſay, <q>
                  <hi>that inſtances of wanton cruelty are much more frequent among my country-men here, than among the Dutch, who are, and perhaps not without reaſon, generally reproached with want of humanity, at Batavia and the Cape.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The foregoing accounts of the cruel uſage the miſerable <hi>Africans</hi> find, with little variation in all places and amongſt every people where ſlavery prevails will doubtleſs be grevious to ſuch who feel for the cauſe of humanity and juſtice. Nor is it to be expected that there will be any amendment, whilſt the deſſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies which happen by deaths, can ſo
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013762_0069_0F91A74EF52A9C68"/>eaſily be made up by freſh imports, and the lives of the miſerable negroes are left to the caprice and paſſion of their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or their overſeers, more eſpecially as theſe laſt generally expect favour from their maſters, in proportion to the ſugar, &amp;c. they cauſe to be made, without any check from the laws, which rather coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the murder of the ſlaves, if done, or ſaid to be <hi>"done by way of chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</hi> And even when it is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known that the death of a ſlave has been occaſioned thro' <q>
                  <hi>bloody mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs or wanton cruelty;</hi>
               </q> yet agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the prevailing opinion, that the ſpirits of the ſlaves muſt be kept down by the moſt humiliating diſtinctions, and ſeverity of diſcipline; the proſecution of ſuch murders is diſcouraged, indeed great difficulties would attend thoſe who would attempt it, as it is ſeldom that any white perſon is preſent when ſuch murder is committed, except the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer or his dependants; and that the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the negroes is of no validity againſt the whites. Hence the lives of the poor ſlaves are in every reſpect, in a very precarious ſituation, ſubject to the paſſion and rage of thoſe who have the rule over them, and the ſpilling of their blood unnoticed by thoſe who ought to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013762_0070_0F91A74FB5AD2A48"/>protect them; nevertheleſs, it is not hid from the all-feeing eye of God, and will doubtleſs remain, tho' a covered, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated ſtore of divine diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perpetrators of it.</p>
            <p>And here it may not be improper to lay before the reader a few inſtances from the many, very many, which might be given of the ſhocking cruelties exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on the miſerable negroes, being a ſtriking inſtance of the dreadful inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which the habit of hard and cruel meaſures will gradually introduce in the human heart.</p>
            <p>The firſt inſtance was related by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who furniſhed the compiler with the advertiſement from <hi>North-Carolina,</hi> viz. That whilſt he was there a negro wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man flying into the woods, probably from ill uſage, was purſued by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer, who having met with her, after cruelly beating her, faſtned her to his horſe, ſo to drag rather than lead her; that before he reached the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhe was a dead corpſe. Such uſage of a fellow-creature appeared moſt unnatural and cruel to the relater; but what moſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized him was, to find that this poor creature's life being taken away in ſo brutal a manner, made no impreſſion on the minds of the people; it raiſed no
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013762_0071_0F91A751AE1082D0"/>indignation againſt the murderer, or commiſeration for the unhappy victim; they ſeemed quite hardned to ſuch ſcenes. He heard but one perſon take any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of notice of the matter.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance fell under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate notice of a perſon of credit, when in the iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> now reſiding in this city. Hearing a grievous cry, he went to the place from whence it came, where he ſaw a young negro wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of about eighteen years of age, ſwung by her hands, with heavy weights at her feet, and a man laſhing her naked body with a hard whip; making pauſes from time to time, and flinging pickle or ſalt and water on the wounds, the whip had made. The ſight was ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that he turned from it and came home. Sometime after, looking out, he ſaw this ſame young woman carried dead on a board: She had been cruelly whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to death; neither did he obſerve that this pitious ſpectacle drew the concern or hardly attention of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>A third inſtance happened in <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> in the preſence of a perſon now reſiding there. A veſſel had taken in a number of ſlaves, on the coaſt of Guinea, amongſt theſe was a man, who probably
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013762_0072_0F91A751F2E35BE8"/>from the dignity of his ſituation in his own country, or from ſome other cauſe, did not ſhew ſuch ſubmiſſion as the ſhip's people expected and require of slaves. They attempted to tie him with ropes, but that not anſwering their purpoſe, they confined him in irons, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo tormented him during their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from <hi>Guinea,</hi> in order to bring down his ſpirit, that when they arrived at <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> he was in ſo weak a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as to be ſcarce able to walk to the place of ſale, but as he was urged on with the whip. When the slaves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the evening, this man remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſold, was forced along with the reſt towards the veſſel, he walked on for a while, till he came to the market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, where he fell; but the whip being exerciſed upon him, he roſe, and going on a little farther dropt down dead. The relater, a perſon of credit, ſaw the tranſaction, and exclaimed againſt the barbarity; but no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               </gap> ſea, to be devoured by the ſharks.</p>
            <p>The laſt inſtance I ſhall mention, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>Carolina,</hi> on board a veſſel with ſlaves from <hi>Guinea,</hi> related by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lately in this city from thence. It
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013762_0073_0F91A752B542B848"/>ſeems the poor negroes had let in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, from a fire appearing on the ſhore, that the white people propoſed to put them to death; this made them unwilling to leave the ſhip: However they were all made to comply except one man, who had taken ſo ſtrong hold of ſome part of the ſhip, that the ſailors were not able to looſe him. This raiſed the anger of the captain to ſo great a degree, that he ſtruck the poor fellow ſo hard a blow, with ſomething like an handſpike, as broke both his arms, whereby the captain looking upon the fellow as diſabled and unfit for ſale, gave him another blow on the head, which cauſed his brains to fly about the veſſel.</p>
            <p>"We know, ſays a late reſpectable author, that the negroes (employed in our plantations) are purchaſed from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

I know it has been ſaid, that queſtions concerning the ſtate of perſons ought to be determined by the law of the country to which they belong; and that, therefore, one who would be declared to be a ſlave in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> ought, in caſe he ſhould happen to be imported into <hi>Britain,</hi> to be adjudged according to the law of <hi>America</hi> to be a ſlave; a doctrine, than which nothing can be more barbarous.

Let the negroes free, and in a few generations, this vaſt and fertile continent, would be crowded with inhabitants; learning, arts, and every thing would flouriſh amongſt them: Inſtead of being inhabited by wild beaſts, and by ſavages, it would be peopled by philoſophers, and by men." <hi>Prins. law of Scotl.</hi>

EXTRACT of a Sermon preached by the Biſhop of Glouceſter, before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for the Propagation of the Goſpel at their anniverſary meeting, on the 21ſt of <hi>February,</hi> 1766.</p>
            <p>FROM the free-ſavages I now come (the laſt point I propoſe to conſider) to the ſavages in bonds. By theſe I mean the vaſt multitudes yearly ſtolen from the oppoſite continent, and ſacrificed by the coloniſts to their great idol, the GOD OF GAIN. But what then, ſay theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere worſhippers of <hi>Mamman,</hi> they are our own property, which we offer up. Gracious God! to talk (as in herds of cattle) of property in rational creatures! creatures endowed with all our faculties, poſſeſſing all our qualities but that of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; our brethren both by nature and grace, ſhocks all the feelings of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the dictates of common ſenſe. But, alas! what is there in the infinite abuſes of ſociety which does not ſhock them? Yet nothing is more certain in itſelf, and apparent to all, than that the infamous traffic for ſlaves directly infringes both divine and human law. <hi>Nature created man free,; and grace invites him to aſſert his freedom.</hi> In excuſe of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013762_0080_0F91A75BAF8B99B0"/>this violation, it hath been pretended, that though indeed theſe miſerable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts of humanity be torn from their homes and native country by fraud and violence, yet they thereby become the happier, and their condition the more eligible. But who are You, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to judge of another man's happineſs? That ſtate, which each man, under the guidance of his maker, forms for himſelf; and not one man for another. To know what conſtitutes mine or your happineſs, is the ſole prerogative of him who created us, and caſt us in ſo various and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent moulds. Did your ſlaves ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to you of their unhappineſs amidſt their native woods and deſarts? Or, rather, let me aſk, did they ever ceaſe complaining of their condition under you their lordly maſters? Where they ſee, indeed, the accommodations of civil life, but ſee them all paſs to others, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unbenefited by them. Be ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then, ye petty tyrants over hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man freedom, to let your ſlaves judge for themſelves, what it is which makes their own happineſs. And then ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not place it in the return to their own country, rather than in the contemplation of your grandeur, of which
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013762_0081_0F91A75C73AAFD60"/>their miſery makes ſo large a part. A return ſo paſſionately longed for, that deſpairing of happineſs here, that is, of eſcaping the chains of their cruel taſk maſters, they conſole themſelves with feigning it to be the gracious reward of heaven in their future ſtate; which I do not find their haughty maſters have as yet concerned themſelves to invade. The leſs hardy indeed wait for this felicity till overwearied nature ſets them free; but the more reſolved have recourſe even to ſelf-violence, to force a ſpeedier paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
            <p>But it will be ſtill urged, that though what is called human happineſs be of ſo fantaſtic a nature, that each man's ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination creates it for himſelf, yet hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man miſery is more ſubſtantial and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form throughout all the tribes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Now, from the worſt of human miſeries, the ſavage <hi>Africans</hi> by theſe forced emigrations, are intirely ſecured, ſuch as the being perpetually hunted down like beaſts of prey or proſit, by their more ſavage and powerful neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours—In truth, a bleſſed change!—from being hunted to being caught. But who are they that have ſet on foot this general HUNTING? Are they not
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:013762_0082_0F91A75D429E6900"/>theſe very civilized violators of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty themſelves? Who tempt the weak appetites, and provoke the wild paſſions of the fiercer ſavages to pray upon the reſt."</p>
