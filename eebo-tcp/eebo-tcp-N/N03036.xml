            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <q>He begins his Attack with an endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice his unwary Reader, by branding a Church remarkable for her Indulgence, to Diſſenters of all Denominations, with the hateful Name of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.— Is it not however, aſtoniſhing, that any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Man, ſhould furniſh his Adverſary with a Weapon, wherewith to diſpatch himſelf? This our Author has effectually done: For has not <hi>New-England</hi> been notorious, for her Barbarities and cruel Perſecutions? Does<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe not ſtill continue to perſecute honeſt and well meaning Chriſtians, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the true Church, by robbing them of their Eſtates, towards the ſupport of Schiſmatical Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; and does ſhe not yearly impriſon their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for refuſing to comply with her wicked and unjuſt Demands? Again, it will not (I hope) be impertinent, to ask (ſuppoſing the Truth of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Allegation) if the Diſſenters ever did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch Perſecution from the Church of England, as ſhe has ſuffered from them? &amp;c. — Epiſcopacy they aboliſhed, murdered two Arch-Biſhops, defaced, abuſed, demoliſhed Churches. The Clergy many thouſands in Number, they impriſoned, plundered, ejected &amp;c.— whoſe Sufferings therefore, muſt entitle them to the Character of the true Church?</q>

Here we have the <hi>Church of England</hi> repreſented in the brighteſt Colours, for her remarkable Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to Diſſenters of all Denominations. The <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> are painted as the moſt black and barbarous Perſecutors; and <hi>New England</hi> eſpecially, as being notorious for her Barbarities, and cruel Perſecutions; and the <hi>Church of England</hi> by her unheard of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, entitled to the Character of the true Church. But what Proofs does he give us of all this? What Evidence have we of any one of theſe Facts, beſides the bare Word of a Gentleman, which he may think it unmannerly, for any one to call into Queſtion? But I think it would not have been amiſs for him, to have conſidered his own Rule in this Caſe, that "unauthorized Aſſertions deſerve no Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion"</p>
                     <p>Perſecution is ſuch an unmerciful Violation of all the Laws of Humanity and ſo diametrically oppoſite to the Spirit of the Goſpel, that nothing can be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid in its favour, whoſoever are chargeable with it. It cannot be painted in too black colours, nor rendred too odious to the World. It may therefore be worth the while, to inquire into the Juſtice of this Gentleman's Declamation againſt the Diſſenters, and to conſider how much his Cauſe will gain, by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon which he provokes us to make.</p>
                     <p>You can't expect, that I ſhould give a particular relation of all the Perſecutions we have ſuffered from the epiſcopal Party. This would require ſeveral Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes in Folio. Some brief Hints may be ſufficient, to diſcover the Modeſty of this Gentleman, in the confident Aſſertions under Conſideration.</p>

The Number really executed in the pretended courſe of Juſtice,— and who died by the Hangman, is very great; and I am told that three hundred ſixty two are to be found upon the ſeveral Books of the Juſticiary and Council Courts, upon Record, beſides what were executed by military Laws as they call them, of which no Record has been kept.</p>

                        <p>Among theſe, I ſay nothing of the Pillage and Spoil of Goods, the turning Women and Children out into the Fields, in Cold and Nakedneſs, after devouring their Food, and tearing off their Cloaths from their Backs, of which many periſhed for Want, and by the Extremities of the Weather.</p>

                     <p>And now let us conſider our Author's particular Charges againſt <hi>us.</hi> 
                        <q>Has not <hi>New-England</hi> (ſays he) been notorious for her <hi>Barbarities</hi> and cruel <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions?</hi> Does ſhe not yet continue to perſecute ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and well meaning Chriſtians, Members of the true Church, by robbing them of their Eſtates, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Support of Schiſmatical Teachers? and does ſhe not yearly impriſon their Bodies? &amp;c.</q> To which I anſwer, if he can make our this Charge by ſufficient Evidences, I ſhall join with him, in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Teſtimony againſt theſe things. For I look upon <hi>Perſecution</hi> to be too black and enormous a Crime, to admit of any Apology; and it is full as bad in <hi>New-England,</hi> as any where elſe.</p>
                     <p>I freely acknowledge, that in the Infancy of <hi>New-England,</hi> they made ſome <hi>ſevere Laws</hi> againſt certain Seducers, crowding in among them, who threatned no leſs than the Diſſolution of their Government. There were ſome Severities uſed in thoſe days, particularly toward a ſort of <hi>Quakers,</hi> that were ſcarce juſtifiable; neither do we go about to <hi>juſtify</hi> them: yet, I muſt obſerve, that upon a fair State of the Matter, much might be pleaded to <hi>extenuate</hi> thoſe Proceedings, and make them appear abundantly <hi>leſs</hi> harſh and rigorous, than they are by our Adverſaries repreſented to be.

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003651_0017_10023C45A4EF98D0"/>the <hi>Sectaries</hi> of that Day, againſt whom thoſe <hi>New-England</hi> Laws were chiefly ſharpned, were a more tumultuous and blaſphemous Generation, than in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times. However, there were but few Proſecutions, upon thoſe Laws, before the <hi>New-Englanders</hi> grew ſenſible of their Error in making them, and ſoon went into an intire <hi>Toleration</hi> of the various Sectaries crept in amongſt them. And when the Revolution came, the <hi>Convention</hi> (in <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi>) upon that Occaſion, unanimouſly voted, That <hi>any Laws, which might ſeem — contrary to a due Liberty of Conſcience, never ſhould be executed in the Territory</hi>
                        <note n="†" place="bottom">

And ſince that Time ſeveral Laws have been made for the Eaſe of <hi>Quakers, Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> with Relation to the publick Taxes. So that I know of nothing, that can free our Author (as to the ſubſtance of his Crimination) from the guilt of groundleſs Slander and Calumny.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that ſome former Laws of <hi>New-England,</hi> which have had the royal Approbation, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>King's</hi> Laws, do intitle the Miniſter, elected by the Majority of the Inhabitants within his Pariſh, to the Salary agreed upon by them, to be levied by Rate upon 'em all. If the Majority of the Pariſh be <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> their Miniſter has a legal claim to the Salary: but if the Majority be of our Perſwaſion, their Miniſter in like manner has the Claim. And what Grounds then can there be for this tragical Outcry? Certainly it is not over-modeſt, for a Clergyman of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to exclaim after this manner, when it's notorious, that not only the <hi>Tenths</hi> of their Income are paid by all Profeſſions in <hi>England,</hi> to the eſtabliſhed Clergy: but that the epiſcopal Clergy <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where</hi> exact their <hi>Salary,</hi> from thoſe of other Perſuaſions, where they can legally do it. This is exemplified in <hi>New-York;</hi> and on the Weſt End of <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> where the Epiſcopalians are not above a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003651_0018_10023C0FA4907D28"/>tenth Part of the People. And thus it is alſo in <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Virginia,</hi> and <hi>Carolina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what makes this Crimination the more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant is, that ſuch Regard has been had to the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Clergy amongſt us, that in <hi>Maſſachuſett</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> Governments, wherever there is an epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Incumbent ſetled, he is intitled by <hi>Laws</hi> not long ſince made, to <hi>that Part</hi> of the Tax for the Support of the Miniſtry, which is paid by the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>his own</hi> Congregation. And each epiſcopal Congregation hath power to raiſe what Tax they pleaſe among themſelves, for the Support of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>
                     <p>And all muſt acknowlege, that <hi>from the Beginning</hi> our Treatment of <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> coming into theſe Parts, has been with an exemplary <hi>Candour, Charity</hi> and <hi>Civility.</hi> Many Years paſſed indeed before the <hi>Church of England</hi> Service or Common Prayer was publickly us'd in the Country: But what was the <hi>Reaſon?</hi> Becauſe there never was all that while a ſufficient Number to form a Congregation, or elſe they cou'd never find Clergymen to undertake the Cure of their Souls One or other of theſe was the true Reaſon. Not, becauſe the <hi>Government</hi> forbad or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd their Setting up the <hi>Epiſcopal Way.</hi> No; <hi>They</hi> have always had that Regard to the Law of chriſtian Forbearance, that they never (as I can learn) gave the leaſt moleſtation to that Way: altho', it's well known that <hi>New-England</hi> was ſought by the firſt Planters as a Retreat from the Impoſition of ſome Ceremonies in the Church Service. All along, if any appearing to be Men fearing, God, have offer'd to joyn in Worſhip with the Churches here, they have readily been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to Communion in ſpecial Ordinances, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their being in Judgment Epiſcopal. And in later Times, wherever a number in any Place have been deſirous to ſet up the Way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no Interruption has been given to their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: ſave what is common to their Neighbours

                     <p>But let us now turn the Tables, and ſee how it far'd with <hi>us,</hi> when in an <hi>evil Reign</hi> we loſt our Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the Government fell into Epiſcopal Hands.

                     <p>He goes on to prove, by a variety of Scriptures, that there is a Power and Authority belonging to the Rulers of the Church; and that the Exerciſe of that Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not a <hi>Lording it over God's Heritage.</hi> But what is this to the Purpoſe? Who ever diſputed this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or the lawful Exerciſe of it?</p>
                     <p>He moreover aſſures us, that <q>the Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our <hi>Biſhops</hi> is falſely ſuggeſted to be <hi>Lording it over God's Heritage,</hi> they have enacted no Laws of their own, that exceed their Commiſſion, and the Apoſtolical Rule, of having all Things done decently and in Order.</q> This I confeſs is to the Purpoſe; and if he could have given good Evidence of it, 'twould have done our Buſineſs effectually. But I ſuſpect, there will remain nothing but his bare Word to ſupport his Cauſe, when throughly examin'd.</p>
                     <p>Have they <hi>enacted no Laws of their own, that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Commiſſion!</hi> But who gave them Commiſſion, to impoſe any <hi>Laws</hi> at all, upon the Subjects of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? <hi>The Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our King.</hi> I have already ſhewn, that they have enacted a great Number of ſevere <hi>Laws,</hi> which they have enjoined with the greateſt Penalties they could annex to 'em. But I ſtill enquire, by what Authority? If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has given Power to his Church to make <hi>Laws,</hi> every Church have equal Claim to this legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Faculty: And how then will this Gentleman juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the <hi>Reformation?</hi> May not the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> uſe this Authority, given them by Chriſt, as well as the Church of <hi>England?</hi> If he anſwers to this, that the papal Laws are unſcriptural, and therefore beyond their Commiſſion: I reply, ſo are the Laws of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Now, who muſt be Judge in this Caſe. If
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:003651_0026_10023C24444FA340"/>we are referred to the Church for a Deciſion, <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantiſm</hi> in general, as well as <hi>Presbytery,</hi> muſt fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Tryal. And what is worſe than this, we muſt neceſſarily ſubmit to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, of the <hi>Armenian, Georgian, Mingrellian</hi> Churches; and in a Word, of all the Churches in the World. For if the Deciſion belong to the <hi>Church,</hi> it belongs to one Church as well as another; and beſure every one will determine in their own Favour. And thus Light and Darkneſs, Truth and Error, and the moſt contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sentiments in the World, muſt be blended toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and every Man muſt be of every Opinion.—If he appeals to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> to determine this Matter, we are ready to join Iſſue with him, upon that Foot. But then, who muſt <hi>interpret</hi> the Scriptures for us, in this Caſe? If we are allowed the Uſe of our own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, the Scriptures are on our Side the Queſtion. If the <hi>Church</hi> may impoſe her Interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, all the forementioned Difficulties recur. For <hi>every</hi> Church pretends to found her Authority upon the Scriptures. Nor will it do, for this Gentleman to plead, that <hi>other Churches</hi> are in the wrong, and the <hi>Church of England</hi> in the Right. For they will retort the Argument, with as much Juſtice and as good Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, as he can have. His only Way therefore, to avoid theſe Conſequences, is to produce a Commiſſion for the <hi>Church of England,</hi> EXCLUSIVE of all other Churches, to make theſe <hi>Laws,</hi> and enforce them; otherwiſe all Pretences to a <hi>legiſlative</hi> Authority, will ſound very odly, from thoſe that diſclaim <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We have this Gentleman's Word for it, that <hi>theſe Injunctions are falſely ſuggeſted, to be Lording it over God's Heritage.</hi> To which I anſwer; They have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enough heard, that our Conſciences tell us (after the beſt Enquiry we can make) that they are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Laws</hi> of Chriſt; and yet they are neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enjoin'd with all their Penalties. What then can be done? Here is the Authority of <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the one Hand, and <hi>their</hi> Authority on the other. By the beſt Light
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003651_0026_10023C24444FA340"/>we can get, to obey them is to diſobey the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. If they ſay, our Conſciences are <hi>weak</hi> and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, it's the ſame thing: for <hi>to him that eſteemeth any thing unclean, to him it is unclean,</hi> Rom. xiv. 14. <hi>He that doubts, is damned, if he eat,</hi> ver. 23. and <hi>by this a weak Conſcience is defiled,</hi> 1 Cor. viii. 7. As we can make our appeal to the righteous Judge, before whom we muſt finally anſwer for our Conduct, that we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeavour Obedience to him, in the conteſted Articles; ſo we chearfully appeal to the World, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ben't an unjuſtifiable <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> thus to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>to deſtroy thoſe, for whom Chriſt died.</hi>—Who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered them <hi>to judge their Brother, or to ſet at nought their Brother?</hi> (Rom. xiv. 10.) Or to <hi>put a Stumbling Block, or Occaſion to fall, in their Brother's way?</hi> (verſe 13.) Is this <hi>to bear the Infirmity of the weak,</hi> (as theſe Engroſſers of all Wiſdom are pleaſed to call as) or is it <hi>to pleaſe themſelves?</hi> (Rom. xv. 1.) Is this <hi>to receive one another, as Chriſt alſo received us, to the Glory of God?</hi> (ver. 7.) — Methinks better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, or leſs Aſſurance, would very well become our Tory Friends, in the Caſe before us.</p>
                     <p>I am next to conſider what Grounds this Author has for all his Banter and Railery<note n="‡" place="bottom">Pag. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> at the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> for aſſerting it to be a <hi>natural Right,</hi> for a People to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> their moſt important Affairs, to one that they can <hi>approve;</hi> and that the Impoſing their Miniſters upon Congregations is a <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would not uſe, in ſupplying the Vacancy made by the Death of <hi>Judas;</hi> and in the Election of <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons.</hi> To which he anſwers, <q>This Gentleman would do well to conſider, that we are not now in a State of Nature, but of Grace; and he would find it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no eaſy Task, to deſcribe his State of Nature, and what particular Powers Men in that ſuppoſed State, have a juſt Claim to.</q> I would not willingly overlook this Argument, if I could any ways find
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:003651_0027_10023BE42840BBB8"/>out what the Gentleman would prove by it. I can hardly think he means, that all his Party are in <hi>a State of Grace,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe that the Apoſtle uſes a like Phraſe, in <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 14. Becauſe I believe that he himſelf will own, that there are ſome few of 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Dominion of Sin.</hi> But perhaps he may intend (for I can but gueſs at his Meaning) that the Grace of the Goſpel has made void the Law of Nature; and we are no longer to regard the Dictates of it. If thus, he is ſo unhappy, as to have the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> for his Adverſary, in this caſe, Rom. iii. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:003651_0027_10023BE42840BBB8"/>add, if the Power of impoſing a Miniſter upon a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be allow'd to belong to the <hi>Superiour Officers</hi> of any Church, it muſt be allow'd to belong to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Officers of <hi>every</hi> Church, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may claim it, as well as the Church of <hi>England;</hi> unleſs the <hi>Engliſh Biſhops</hi> can ſhew a Commiſſion, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſiue</hi> of all but themſelves, to impoſe their Miniſter upon a People: and thus they have no Right to refuſe Subjection to a <hi>popiſh Prieſt</hi> as their Miniſter, who live in <hi>popiſh</hi> Countries.</p>
                     <p>Our Author's Endeavours to prove, that the Apoſtle <hi>Matthias</hi> was not choſen by the <hi>Suffrages</hi> of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are altogether impertinent; for who ever pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it? I grant, that an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> receiv'd his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, <hi>not of Man, nor by Men; but</hi> immediately <hi>by Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Father, who raiſed him from the Dead.</hi> And yet, the <hi>Suffrage</hi> of the whole viſible Church then preſent (which conſiſted of but a hundred and twenty Perſons, as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> i. 15.) was taken, in ſupplying the Vacancy made by the Death of <hi>Judas,</hi> not for <hi>chuſing an Apoſtle,</hi> but for <hi>appointing two qualified Perſons;</hi> out of which one was to be ſet apart, by the immediate Voice of Providence, unto that ſacred Character: and accordingly we are told, that <hi>they appointed two, Joſeph called Barſabas, who was Surnamed Juſtus, and Matthias,</hi> Acts i. 23. Tho' the Character of an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> made it neceſſary, that he ſhould have an immediate Call to his Office; yet the whole Chriſtian Church, being concerned and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the Qualifications of this publick Officer, they are all conſulted in the Caſe, and have ſuch a Voice in it, that the Perſon when appointed, cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreable to 'em. This is plain Matter of Fact: and this ſolemn Tranſaction in the very Infancy of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Inſtitution, is a <hi>ſtanding Pattern</hi> to the Churches, thro' all ſucceeding Ages, in that Reſpect.</p>
                     <p>And as to the ſeven <hi>Deacons,</hi> if it be poſſible that any Thing can be fully and clearly repreſented by Words, we are certain, that they were choſen by
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:003651_0028_10023C01EEC1FC68"/>the Church: <hi>Wherefore Brethren (ſay the Apoſtles,) lock ye out among you, ſeven Men of honeſt Report, full of the Holy Ghoſt and Wiſdom, whom we may appoint over this Buſineſs: and the Saying pleaſed the whole Multitude; and they CHOSE Stephen, a Man full of Faith and the Holy Ghoſt, and Philip,</hi> &amp;c. Acts vi. 3, 5. I am ſurprized to find this Gentleman aſſerting, <q>that it doth not at all appear, that the Apoſtles counted this a Priviledge of the People; but the contrary; becauſe the People claimed no ſuch <hi>Right;</hi> but did it in Obedience to the Apoſtles.</q> — But it's certain, whether the People <hi>claimed</hi> that Right or not, it <hi>was</hi> their Right, a <hi>Right</hi> allowed them by the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> under whoſe Guidance the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were in this their Conduct, and by whom the People were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in an unjuſtifiable Uſurpation.—And how does it at all affect the Caſe, that <q>the Apoſtles reſerved to themſelves the Right of <hi>appointing</hi> theſe Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to their Office?</q> The Queſtion is not about the <hi>Ordination</hi> (which is all that is meant by the Apoſtles <hi>appointing</hi> them, as appears from ver. 3. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with ver. 6.) but about the <hi>Election,</hi> of theſe Church-Officers. They were <hi>choſen</hi> by the <hi>Multitude,</hi> if the ſacred Text may be credited; which is all I plead for. And I miſtake, if our Author does not in effect give up the Cauſe, when he allows that the <q>nomination of Perſons is put on the People, and that this was the Apoſtolical Practice.</q> But how he will prove the "practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with this," I am at a Loſs.</p>
                     <p>I might further obſerve, if the original of the Text in <hi>Acts</hi> xiv. 23. were duely noticed, it will appear, that the People had conſtantly the Liberty of chuſing their Miniſters, allowed them by the Apoſtles themſelves. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Let us next conſider, whether he has any better Succeſs, in anſwering the ſame Plea of the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi> 
                        <q>The Argument of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (he tells us) is this, You acknowledge a Poſſibility of Salvation in our Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> that invincible Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance joined with true Sincerity, may be an Apology for the Errors of many in it, which we do not acknowledge concerning yours. But pray who is ſo ſtupid as not to diſcover, that this is no Argument, why thoſe who know the Errors and Superſtitions of that Church, ſhould go over to it?</q>—By this Gentleman's Leave, I ſhall venture to retort the Anſwer. The Argument of the <hi>High Church</hi> Party, is this, You acknowledge
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:003651_0031_100202458E7844F8"/>our Ordination valid, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the invincible Miſtakes, join'd with Sincerity, of thoſe who ſubmit to an uninſtituted Hierarchy, may be an Apology for their Error in it, which we don't acknowledge concerning yours. But pray who is ſo ſtupid as not to diſcover, that this is no Argument, why thoſe that know the Uſurpations of <hi>Prelacy,</hi> their Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Rights of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and their unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Original, ſhould go over to them? I hope he won't be offended, with the Harſhneſs of the Language, ſince it's borrowed from himſelf; and I think he'll be very much put to it, to make any Reply to this Reaſoning, that mayn't with the ſame Juſtice, be urged in Favour of the <hi>popiſh</hi> Argument, which he undertakes to anſwer. He tells us indeed, that <q>the Diſſenters acknowledge <hi>epiſcopal Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> lawful, and conſidered by itſelf ſafe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, they ought therefore to ſubmit to it; becauſe a Deviation from it, cannot be acceptable to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</q>— Which is ſo far from Truth, that we all believe, and have often enough proved, that the only <hi>Ordination,</hi> either inſtituted or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the Scriptures, is by the Impoſition of the Hands of a <hi>Presbytery;</hi> and that our Deviation from this, cannot be acceptable to Almighty God. We grant indeed, that their <hi>Ordinations</hi> are lawful, if he intends no more by their being <hi>lawful,</hi> than that they are <hi>not a Nullity;</hi> and that their Clergy are thereby authorized to adminiſter ſacred Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. But if he means by their being lawful, that their <hi>Epiſcopal Ordinations</hi> are ſuch, as are according to the <hi>divine Pattern</hi> and <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> we have ever denied it; and it is what they have never been able to prove. But were even that granted, that <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Ordination</hi> is even in this latter ſenſe lawful, how does that affect the Debate between us? Have we no other Objections againſt the <hi>Ordinations</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that are ſufficient to deter us from going thither for Orders? Were there none
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003651_0031_100202458E7844F8"/>ſuch offered in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> that might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him, that we did not eſteem theſe <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ſafe and ſecure for us?</p>
                     <p>Thus, Sir, you ſee that we have no more Cauſe to be frighted with this Spectre than they have; whoever conjures it up.</p>
                     <p>I am now to ſhew you, that we have juſt Cauſe of the ſame Objections againſt their <hi>Epiſcopal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> as were offered in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pretended Anſwers to 'em. (p. 12-15.) I ſhall therefore, once more expoſtulate the matter with them; and conſider his Replies, as I paſs along.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Is it the ſafer Side,</hi> to acknowledge and ſubmit to a <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> not warranted in the Word of God? To which he anſwers, No. Well then, he himſelf being Judge, it is not ſafeſt for us to ſeek Orders from their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> till we are convinced of the divine Right of Prelacy. Let him therefore ſhew us, where this is to be found in the Word of God, and he will effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilence our Objections.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Is it the ſafer Side,</hi> for me to ſolemnly declare at my Ordination, that I am moved by the Holy Ghoſt, to take upon me the Office of a <hi>Deacon;</hi> when I have no Purpoſe to ſerve Tables, for which <hi>Deacons</hi> were inſtituted?

Acts vi. 2, 3. <hi>Then the twelve called the Multitude of the Diſciples unto them; and ſaid, It is not Reaſon that we ſhould leave the Word of God, and SERVE TABLES. Wherefore, Brethren, look ye out among you Seven Men of honeſt Report, whom we may appoint over THIS BUSINESS.</hi> It is poſſible, that any Thing can be

Have <hi>Deacons</hi> any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſs appointed them, than to <hi>ſerve Tables?</hi> Is nor ſerving of Tables put in direct Oppoſition to the Miniſtry of the Word?—But he tells us, that <hi>"Philip Deacon preached and baptized"</hi> Was <hi>Philip</hi> no more than a <hi>Deacon?</hi> Is he not expreſly called an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> Acts xxi. 8?

                     </p>
                     <p>We may firſt then conſider, what was the proper Work and Buſineſs of the <hi>Prieſthood.</hi> And this can't be better deſcribed, than in the Apoſtle's Language, Heb. v 1. <hi>For every high Prieſt taken from among Men, is ordained for Men, in Things pertaining to God, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for Sins.</hi> And Heb. viii. 3 <hi>For every high Prieſt is ordained to offer Gifts and Sacrifices.</hi> Whence it's moſt certain, that every <hi>Prieſt,</hi> of whatever Order, is ſtrictly and properly a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer;</hi> that the very End and Deſign of the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> was to offer Gifts and Sacrifices; and that the Terms, <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> are ſynonymous and reciprocal. Whence, when all true Chriſtians are alluſively call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>an holy Prieſthood,</hi> 'tis on Account of their <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpiritual Sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. ii. 5.</p>
                     <p>And we may conſider wherein the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of <hi>Melchizedec</hi> and of <hi>Aaron</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. The Diſtinction between them was not with Relation to <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of both was by theſe Oblations to lead the Minds, and direct the Faith and Hope of God's People, unto the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> by whom all the faithful of <hi>Adam's</hi> Progeny had their only Proſpect of Reconciliation unto God. But it conſiſted in the ſpecial <hi>perſonal Qualifications,</hi> by which <hi>Melchizedec</hi> had the Preference of <hi>Aaron</hi>
                        <pb n="60" facs="unknown:003651_0033_10023C166634D688"/>He was immediately called to the <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> without any external Rites of Conſecration, ſuch as were uſed at <hi>Aaron's</hi> Separation. He was a <hi>King,</hi> as well as <hi>Prieſt; Aaron</hi> had no regal Dignity. His <hi>Prieſthood</hi> was perpetual, as he had not derived it from any other; and as he had no known Father or Mother, Beginning of Days, or End of Life. Whereas the <hi>Aaronical Prieſthood</hi> was in a lineal Deſcent, and the <hi>Prieſts</hi> themſelves were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was greater than <hi>Abraham:</hi> but the Aaronical Prieſts, as they were <hi>Abraham's</hi> Poſterity, were his Inferiours. Theſe were the ſpecial Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, between the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of <hi>Melchizedec</hi> and of <hi>Aaron.</hi> And it was in theſe Reſpects, that the great <hi>high Prieſt of our Profeſſion</hi> is ſaid to be after the Order of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> as may be particularly ſeen, in the viith Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of <hi>Melchizedec</hi> and of <hi>Aaron</hi> was, in it ſelf conſidered, in all Reſpects the ſame; in the ſame Manner referred to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and terminated in him; though there were ſome peculiar <hi>perſonal</hi> Characters belonging to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> more accommodated to the <hi>Prieſthood of Chriſt,</hi> than were to be found in the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> hence our Lord's <hi>Prieſthood</hi> is ſaid to be after his Order. From all which it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that unleſs this Gentleman will join with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in pleading for a proper propitiatory <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> he cannot with any colour of Reaſon pretend as he does, that <hi>their Miniſtry is properly Sacerdotal</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He indeed pretends to reaſon the Caſe, and ſays, <q>Was Jeſus Chriſt a proper <hi>Biſhop</hi> over his Church, by Commiſſion from his Father; and are the viſible <hi>Biſhops</hi> proper <hi>Biſhops</hi> of it, by Miſſion and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from him?</q> then he challenges me to give any good Reaſon, if I can, <q>Why by Miſſion and Commiſſion from Chriſt, the <hi>high Prieſt of our Profeſſion,</hi> they are not alſo proper <hi>Prieſts.</hi>
                        </q> —To which I anſwer, one good Reaſon is, becauſe all the Miniſters of Chriſt have his Miſſion and Commiſſion
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:003651_0033_10023C166634D688"/>to be <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but none to be <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Let him, if he can, ſhew us any ſuch Commiſſion, and we will yield him the Cauſe. Another Reaſon is, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle expreſly tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 24. that Chriſt has a <hi>Prieſthood that cannot paſs from one to another.</hi> For ſo the original Word <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> ſignifies; and ſo it is rendred in the Margin of our <hi>Bibles.</hi> And if his <hi>Prieſthood</hi> be of that Kind, that it cannot paſs from him to any other, no Perſon can be a Sharer in it, nor a Succeſſor to it. To which I add this further Reaſon for it, that tho' Chriſt hath uſe for <hi>Biſhops</hi> in his Church, he has none for <hi>Prieſts;</hi> there being no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for ſuch to offer, ſince he has offered up himſelf <hi>once for all.</hi>— Thus you ſee, what little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have, to leave our Scriptural <hi>Ordinations,</hi> to take upon us the Order of <hi>Prieſthood</hi> among them. And ſo I go on to expoſtulate with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Is it the ſafer Side,</hi> to take upon me the ſolemn Charge of the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> and to come under awful Vows to fulfil it; and yet depend upon the <hi>Biſhop's Licence</hi> to preach?

<pb n="65" facs="unknown:003651_0035_10023C0AA72E6D10"/>I Am at length come to the main Queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Powers of Ordination and Juriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the</hi> Presbyters?</p>
                     <p>It ſeems the irreſiſtible Evidence of this in the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> has given ſuch Conviction to our Author, as has forced him to quit the moſt of thoſe ſtrong Holds, which the Party have conſtantly endeavoured to defend; and has left him but one only Place of Retreat. <q>I grant, (ſays he <hi>p.</hi> 16.) that the Names of <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> are uſed ſo promiſcuouſly in the New-Teſtament, as to leave no Diſtinction of Office. I grant that there are as many <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in the firſt ſenſe of the Word, as <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the moſt early Churches. I grant, that we can find in the New-Teſtament no <hi>Presbyter,</hi> who was not a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> i. e. called by that Name. I grant, that the Duties and Qualifications of thoſe called <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> in the New-Teſtament and of thoſe called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> are the ſame, becauſe they are the Duties and Qualifications of the ſame Church-Officer, called by both theſe Names.</q>—One would think, here are conceſſions enough, to put a perpetual End to this Controverſy: and I might take the Advantage now to turn his own Argument, from the <hi>ſafer Side,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. — Surely he might with as much ſecurity to his Cauſe, have made <hi>one</hi> Conceſſion more, and <hi>granted</hi> that <hi>all</hi> their Pretences to a <hi>Prelacy</hi> in the Church, and for the Superiority of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,</hi> are unſcriptural and groundleſs. However, whether he will make this Conceſſion, or no, we need not I think be in much Pain about the Iſſue of the Controverſy, after he has granted, that the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> makes no Difference between <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters.</hi> However, he is reſolved to hold faſt the Concluſion, tho' he has given up the Premiſes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>But tho' I have grante all this (ſays he) yet I hope may, and will maintain, that the Powers of thoſe called <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the New-Teſtament, were not the ſame, with the Powers of thoſe who were
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:003651_0036_10023BEE7363F9B0"/>called ſo afterwards, in an eminent Senſe: or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Words, that thoſe Church-Officers, who are ſtiled <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the New-Teſtament, have never received nor exerciſed the Right of ordaining others; but that this Right was always in the Hands of Officers, ſuperiour to them.</q>—But how does all this appear? Can he give us any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of it? He tells us, <q>It's evident from the Churches of <hi>Corinth, Ephoſus, Philippi, Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Crete</hi> &amp;c which had in them a Clergy, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeveral Miniſters</q> And then proceeds with the moſt ſcornful Air to inquire, "what Need there was for the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to run the Hazard of long Journeys, and dangerous Voyages, for the performing <hi>Ordinations</hi> in theſe Churches, if the <hi>Elders</hi> already ſetled there, might have done it without them!—This, I confeſs, is a ſhort and compendious Way of finiſhing a Diſpute. At this Rate, no Adverſary need ever want an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Triumph. But I muſt tell this Gentleman, that here is too much in all Reaſon taken for granted, without any Proof.</p>
                     <p>He firſt takes for granted, that the Apoſtles found theſe Churches ſettled with <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> when they conſtituted a Goſpel Miniſtry among them, which is ſo far from evident, that it is not ſo much as poſſible.—The only Account we have of the Apoſtles conſtituting <hi>Elders,</hi> in any of the Gertlle Churches, was at <hi>Lyſtra, Iconium, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> and (it ſeems) <hi>Derbe.</hi> Acts xiv. 21, 23.

                     <p>He again takes it for granted, that the chief or only Errand of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to theſe Churches, was for <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Miniſters</hi> there.—But was there ever a more chimerical Suppoſal, when in all their Peregrinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we find but one Account of their <hi>Ordaining El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> in any particular Churches; and tho' it be there ſaid, that they did this in every <hi>Church,</hi> yet it's plain, that it relates only to every Church <hi>there</hi> mentioned, viz <hi>Derbe, Lyſtra, Iconium</hi> and <hi>Antioch.</hi> As the Apoſtle tells us, 1 Cor. i 17 that <hi>Chriſt ſent him not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel;</hi> ſo may it be likewiſe ſaid, that Chriſt ſent him not to ordain, but to preach the Goſpel: that is, <hi>Preaching</hi> was his <hi>principal</hi> Work It appears to have been the uſual cuſtom of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to tarry long enough in a particular Place, to convince them of the Truth of Chriſtianity, and to initiate them in the Faith and Profeſſion of the Goſpel; and leave behind them, or ſend after them the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> to eſtabliſh them in the Faith, to baptize the new Converts, and to ſettle the Miniſtry among them. For theſe Purpoſes was <hi>Titus</hi> left at <hi>Crete,</hi> (Titus i. 5.) and <hi>Timothy</hi> ſent to moſt of the Churches where the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> had been, as appears by the ſeveral Epiſtles of that Apoſtle. To imagine therefore, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> viſiting the Churches was peculiarly on the Account of <hi>Ordaining Elders,</hi> is ſuch a groundleſs ſurmiſe as deſerves no particular Animadverſion.</p>
                     <p>He further takes for granted, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were properly <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and ſuch, had the

                     <p>It is further argued by this Author (p. 22) <q>As the Word <hi>Presbyter</hi> is promiſcuouſly applied to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, from hence it will follow, that by the laying on of the Hands of the <hi>Presbytery</hi> here mentioned, may very well be underſtood the laying on of the Hands of no other than the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi>
                        </q>—But how will this agree with the Argument we have been juſt conſidering?

                     <p>But we are told (p. 23.) that <q>ſuppoſing <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> peculiarly ſo called, were in this Company, (which doth not appear, nor will the primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at all allow) it will only follow from hence, that they may aſſiſt (with Officers ſuperiour to themſelves) at an <hi>Ordination:</hi> not that they may without ſuch Officers manage this Affair</q>—But by this Gentleman's Leave, there is more to be ſuppoſed, than that there were <hi>Presbyters</hi> in this Company; it is to be ſuppoſed, nay it is certain, even from the very Letter of the Text, that they were <hi>all Presbyters,</hi> and acted <hi>as ſuch</hi> at this <hi>Ordination;</hi> and there is nothing but the meer ſtrength of Imagination, to render the contrary Suppoſal in the leaſt probable.

<pb n="76" facs="unknown:003651_0041_10023BF0DEE45B10"/>for the Miniſtry, by Faſting and Prayer, with Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Hands? And did not the <hi>Presbyters</hi> do all this, in the Caſe before us? What could a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> do more?

                     <p>My Antagoniſt would fain find ſome <hi>other</hi> Buſineſs for the <hi>Presbyters</hi> Hands on the Head of the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date; and therefore tells us, <q>Presbyters may lay on Hands, for the greater Solemnity of the Action, or to give their Conſent or Approbation.</q>—But have we any Scriptural Example of Impoſition of Hands, for either of theſe Purpoſes? Would it ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Would not their ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to the Ordination-Prayer, be ſufficient to give their Conſent or Approbation? In fine, I would obſerve, The Apoſtle evidently lays <hi>Streſs</hi> on the Impoſition of the Hands of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in <hi>Timothy's</hi> Ordination; he makes mention of it to him as a matter of Importance and eminent Weight.

                     <p>ANother Evidence, that Ordination did belong to thoſe called <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> in Scripture, may be taken from <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 1, 3. where we find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſet apart to the Exerciſe of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry among the Gentiles, only by the Impoſition of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:003651_0041_10023BF0DEE45B10"/>the Hands of a <hi>Presbytery.</hi>— That all the uſual Acts and Rites of Ordination, as Faſting, Prayer, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands, were performed by theſe <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> that this was done to ſeparate <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> to the Work of their Miniſtry among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> ſo much is plainly expreſſed in the Text. Now I muſt confeſs, I know not what <hi>Ordination</hi> is, if Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating Men to the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of the Miniſtry, by Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer, with the laying on of Hands, be not a proper and formal <hi>Ordination.</hi> And that theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers were <hi>Presbyters,</hi> and neither <hi>Apoſtles</hi> nor <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſan Biſhops,</hi> is not only plain from the Text; but what our Adverſaries themſelves have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd; and my Antagoniſt evidently allows it.—What Reaſon then can be given, why this is not a ſtanding Precedent, for <hi>Ordination</hi> by a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery?</hi> — But our Author is loth to give up his Cauſe; and muſt therefore ſay ſomething. <q>I deny (ſays he <hi>p.</hi> 23.) that this was an <hi>Ordination</hi> at all; for if this were the <hi>Ordination</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it will follow from hence, not only that <hi>Presbyters</hi> have a Right to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain; but alſo that their Office extended to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining even <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves, and to give them the Authority which they had in the Church.</q>—I deny his Conſequence.

                     <p>He goes on to argue, <q>That this was not a proper <hi>Ordination,</hi> is manifeſt from hence; becauſe this Rite of impoſing Hands, whereby other Miniſters were ordained, was never uſed in making <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> It was a diſtinguiſhing Part of their Character, that they were immediately called and ordained by Chriſt himſelf.</q>—To which I anſwer, it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledg'd, that it was a diſtinguiſhing Part of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Character, to be immediately called by Chriſt himſelf, and that they could not be ordained to the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> by the Impoſition of Hands. But what a Pity it is, that this Gentleman could not have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd</hi> this?

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he can make it appear, that the <hi>Biſhops</hi> have this <hi>immediate</hi> Call and Ordination.

                     <p>But let us ſee, how this Reaſoning affects the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe. Allowing that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> could not be ordained to the <hi>Apoſtolick Office;</hi> allowing that they had an immediate Call to the <hi>Apoſtolate</hi> before: yet might not they have a <hi>peculiar Separation,</hi> to their Miſſion among the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> And was it not moſt agreable, that they ſhould have a moſt open, and ſolemn, and known <hi>Dedication</hi> to that Buſineſs, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> had ſuch ſtrong and rooted Prejudices, as appears, <hi>Acts</hi> xi. 2. and xxi. 20, 25.?—It is obſervable, This Gentleman himſelf ſcruples not to talk of <q>
                           <hi>Occaſional Commiſſions</hi> to execute Apoſtolical Offices, confer'd on thoſe that were Officers before, ſuch as Prophets, Evangeliſts, &amp;c (p. 34)</q> And now I know no Reaſon why I mayn't as well ſuppoſe a like fact, the <hi>occaſional Separation</hi> even of thoſe that were <hi>Officers before,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> with relation to their new Labours in the <hi>Gentile</hi> World: and yet that occaſional <hi>Separation</hi> ſuch, with regard to the <hi>Manner</hi> of performing it, as affords a <hi>permanent Example</hi> to the Church.</p>
                     <p>The Gentleman has yet a further Anſwer to give: <q>Suppoſe (ſays he, p 25.) that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were now ordained, what Advantage can the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters reap thereby?

But I muſt needs ſay, that rational Scripture-Evidence of this would go further with me, than many ſuch Aſſertions, how poſitive ſoever. I find nothing in the Scripture, for thus crumbling the Work of the Miniſtry into Parts; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we are <hi>all</hi> required to <hi>take Heed to our Miniſtry, and fulfil it.</hi> But he tells us, <q>We know well that one <hi>Deacon</hi> cannot ordain another, conſiſtent with the Diſſenters own Scheme.</q> —But are <hi>Deacons</hi> themſelves in <hi>ſacred Orders,</hi> in the Senſe now debat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to <hi>our own</hi> Scheme? What then is this to the Purpoſe? Yet I can't help adding, That if <hi>Deacons</hi> may by virtue of their Office <hi>preach</hi> and <hi>baptize,</hi> and make their <hi>Pulpit Prayers</hi> too (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Practice) I know of no Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety there wou'd be in aſſerting their Right alſo to <hi>ordain:</hi> becauſe he that may do the greater, may certainly do the leſſer, — as before. And truly to be free, I ſhould look upon Ordination performed by a Church of England <hi>Deacon,</hi> to have <hi>Validity,</hi> as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Ordination by a <hi>Prelate.</hi> But now according to <hi>our</hi> Scheme, the <hi>Deacons</hi> have no Authority by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Office to <hi>preach</hi> or <hi>baptize,</hi> or preſide and lead in the <hi>publick Worſhip.</hi> It wou'd be abſurd therefore to ſuppoſe a Power in <hi>them,</hi> of giving Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when the performing publick <hi>Prayers,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring ſolemn <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Charges</hi> in the Name of Chriſt, belong to the Work of Ordination.

They wou'd then ſee there is ſome Weight in Bp. <hi>Uſher's</hi> Maxim, <hi>Ordinis eſt ordinare.</hi>—In Reply to what I had further argued, our Author ſubjoins, <q>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' <hi>Biſhops</hi> do conſecrate <hi>Arch-Biſhops,</hi> it will not follow that <hi>Presbyters</hi> ſhould ordain <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> and the Reaſon is plain, becauſe <hi>Presbyters</hi> are not at all impowered, in the New Teſtament, to perform this Work.</q>—But he ſhould have remembred, that this is the very Caſe in Queſtion; and therefore was it ſelf to be proved, and not brought as an Argument. He, and I, have both appealed to the World, as to the Truth of this Aſſertion. The World is now to judge, whether it is not fully made appear from the New Teſtament, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> are impowered to perform this Work. And I alſo appeal to the World, whether this ben't a good Evidence of <hi>Presbyters</hi> Authority to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, that they <hi>have all the Powers</hi> committed to them in the New Teſtament, that belong to any ordinary Miniſters of the Goſpel; as I have already proved, and hope to make further Evident, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all he can ſay to the contrary.—He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes this Head with ſaying, <q>Neither do we allow of Inferiors conſecrating Superiors, as this Writer wou'd diſinginuoſly inſinuate: For all Biſhops have originally equal Power; tho' a primacy of Order is granted to ſome by general Conſent <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And a hundred like Inſtances, might be given him.—But what I intend, by theſe Things being <hi>Eſſential</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtolick Office,</hi> is, that they are ſo <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that none could be <hi>Apoſtles</hi> without them; not that they were all of them <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> The Apoſtles were indeed bleſſed with ſome miraculous Gifts, which were <hi>peculiar</hi> to them; ſuch as the Holy Ghoſt's being given by the Impoſition of their Hands, which was not only neceſſary to every <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> upon which Account the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls theſe Gifts thus communicated, <hi>the Signs of an Apoſtle,</hi> 2 Cor. xii. 12. but they were alſo ſuch Powers, as none but they were ever endued with. The like
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003651_0050_10023BFB1FC7DD40"/>may be ſaid of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> being <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt.</hi> For tho' many others as well as they, were capable of witneſſing to this Fact, yet they were not peculiarly commiſſioned, and ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the World to be <hi>Evidences</hi> of it: and therefore are not (I think) in the New Teſtament denominated WITNESSES of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> in ſuch a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Manner as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are. But it can't be ſaid of all the extraordinary Qualifications, that were <hi>Eſſential</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> that they were thus <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> It was <hi>Eſſential,</hi> for Inſtance, to the very Being of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that he had a certain Knowledge of that great Fact, upon which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ſo much depends; that Chriſt riſen was <hi>what</hi> he <hi>had heard, what he had ſeen with his Eyes, what he had looked upon; and his Hands had handled,</hi> 1 John i. 8. Wherefore it was a neceſſary Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was choſen in the Place of <hi>Judas,</hi> that he ſhould be one, <hi>that had companied with the eleven Apoſtles, all the Time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out amongſt them, beginning from the Baptiſm of John, to the ſame Day, that he was taken up from them, in order to his being a Witneſs with them of his Reſurrection.</hi> Acts. i. 21, 22. And in like manner, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is caught up to the third Heavens, that he might by a ſight of Chriſt be furniſhed for a <hi>Witneſs</hi> of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> 2 Cor. xii. 2. compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 17. and <hi>Acts</hi> xxii. 17, 18. But then there were <hi>five hundred</hi> beſides theſe, that had ſeen Chriſt after his Reſurrection. 1 Cor. xv. 6. So alſo it was Eſſential to an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that he ſhould have the <hi>miraculous Gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, to <hi>confirm</hi> his Teſtimony of the <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt,</hi> to Jews and Infidels, who would not receive this for Truth, upon Men's bare Word, without this Seal of Heaven to confirm it; as is largely proved in the <hi>Dialogue:</hi> and yet it is manifeſt, that the moſt, if not all the Chriſtians, wherever the Apoſtles went, had theſe
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:003651_0051_10023C526C9C41F0"/>miraculous Gifts, as well as they, tho' not in ſo great a Degree.</p>
                     <p>It is fully ſufficient to my Purpoſe, that theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications were <hi>Eſſentially</hi> neceſſary to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whether they were <hi>peculiar</hi> to them or not. It is enough, that they could not be <hi>Apoſtles</hi> without them.

<pb n="97" facs="unknown:003651_0051_10023C526C9C41F0"/>poſſibly be thought worthy of Notice. Particularly</p>
                     <p>He quotes <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 20. to prove, that the <hi>Apoſtolick Office</hi> was to continue for ever in the Church.—But does that Text ſay any Thing about the <hi>Apoſtolick Office?</hi> That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were, in their <hi>Succeſſors,</hi> to continue to the End of the World, is indeed manifeſt from that Text. But then the Queſtion is, <hi>how</hi> are they ſucceeded? In their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> or in their <hi>ordinary</hi> Capacity? If the former, let their imaginary <hi>Succeſſors</hi> ſhew us thoſe extraordinary Qualifications, that were Eſſentially neceſſary to the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and we will acknowledge their <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Character.

Do all Interpret?</hi> No! if we may believe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the 27th verſe of the ſame Chapter, tho' theſe all belong <hi>to the Body of Chriſt, they are all Members in particular.</hi> So that either the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> or this Gentleman is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in a Miſtake.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have particularly conſidered his firſt <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> upon which lies all the Streſs of his whole Fabrick; and ſhewn that it is neither pertinent to his Purpoſe, nor true in Fact: and the reſt of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance muſt therefore neceſſarily be a Caſtle in the Air, his Foundation being wholly taken away.</p>
                     <p>I might indeed have taken a ſhorter Method with this Gentleman; and put him upon the utter Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of this <hi>Propoſition</hi> with his own Hand. For if it be (as he tells us it is, in <hi>p.</hi> 24) <q>a diſtinguiſhing Part of an <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> Character, that he be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately called and ordained by Chriſt himſelf,</q> it is evident to Demonſtration, that none can be veſted with that Character, but what have that immediate Call and Ordination. And what then becomes of his <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> in the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtolick Office?</hi> unleſs he pretends, that their <hi>Biſhops</hi> are thus <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately called,</hi> and ordained by Chriſt himſelf. It might be worthy of this Gentleman's Pains, to make Peace between theſe two jarring Propoſitions, That <hi>it's a diſtinguiſhing Part of an Apoſtle's Character, that he be immediately called and ordained by Chriſt himſelf:</hi> and yet that <hi>the Apoſtles have properly Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,

                     <p>HIs Second <hi>Propoſition</hi> is (<hi>p.</hi> 35.) <q>That it is not contrary to the Nature of the paſtoral Office, or to the Goſpel, to communicate the entire Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to ſome Officers; and ſome Branches of it only to others." — But how does this appear? In this Opinion I am confirmed (ſays the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) becauſe the Scripture ſuppoſes it may be done; and has left the Communicating the ſeveral Gifts, to the Diſcretion of the Ordainers, to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them, as they find the Perſons to be ordained, qualified to receive them.</q>—The Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to in this Caſe, is <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 6, 7, 8. <q>Where (he tells us) the differing Branches of the paſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Office are placed, not in the ſame, but differing Perſons, <hi>Propheſying</hi> in one, <hi>Teaching</hi> in another, <hi>Exhorting</hi> in a third, <hi>Miniſtring</hi> in another, <hi>Ruling</hi> in another, according as they are qualified.</q>—What a pity it is that this Gentleman has no better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory? It was but in the very laſt Page we were told that <q>the Work of an Evangeliſt, PROPHET &amp;c. was common to every Miniſter.</q> But now, when he has another Turn to ſerve, <q>The differing Branches of the paſtoral Office are placed, not in the ſame, but differing Perſons; PROPHESYING in one, TEACHING in another &amp;c.</q>—But the Truth on't is, that as he greatly miſtook, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Part of his Contradiction, ſo is he in no leſs a Miſtake, in the Application of the Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. For —</p>
                     <p>In the firſt Place, what if the <hi>Gifts</hi> here enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, were not any of them, <hi>Branches</hi> of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>paſtoral Office</hi> at all; but <hi>Gifts</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, extraordinarily, and occaſionally communicated, for the Service of the Church in it's <hi>Infant</hi>-State? How
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:003651_0053_10023C763B5331E0"/>will it then help his Cauſe? I think he won't argue from thoſe extraordinary Diſpenſations, to the ordinary ſtanding Miniſtry in the Church. For thoſe came not by their Authority, from the grand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but by immediate Inſpiration. And that the Text before us did refer to <hi>Gifts</hi> thus immediately communicated, ſeems manifeſt to me; becauſe we find the very ſame Enumeration of <hi>Gifts</hi> in 1 Cor. xii. 28. where the Apoſtle is profeſſedly treating of the extraordinary Chariſmata, through that and the two immediately ſucceeding Chapters.

And as to <hi>Titus,</hi> how is it proved, that there were <hi>Presbyters</hi> ſettled at <hi>Crete,</hi> before he was left at that Iſland! All the Evidence of this is, that this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> it; and therefore it <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo? But why is <hi>Titus</hi> left at <hi>Crete</hi> to ordain Elders in every City, if they had Elders already ordained, and were already ſupply'd? However, were it even ſuppoſed, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were actually improved in ordaining <hi>Elders</hi> in thoſe Churches, where there were <hi>Presbyters</hi> already ſettled, there might be great Want of the ſuperiour <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Perſons, in that infant State of the Church; even tho' the <hi>Presbyters</hi> were of the ſame <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> with them.</p>

He gives us no Advantage to examine the Truth of his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, excepting only with Reſpect to his Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Euſebius;</hi> and all that can be found there, is, that <hi>Timothy</hi> is REPORTED to be the firſt <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> of the Churches in <hi>Crete;</hi> but how <hi>Euſebius</hi> came by this Report, he tells us not.

                     <p>However, the Gentleman perhaps will accuſe me of Neglect, if I paſs over ſome remarkable Paſſages he has in <hi>page</hi> 44.—One is that, <q>And in theſe (the primitive Fathers) there is ſuch a conſtancy and unanimity, that even St. <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf, (who was born near 250 years after the Apoſtles, and is the chief Perſon in all that time whom the Presbyterians cite for any purpoſe of theirs) traces up Epiſcopacy to the very <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and makes it of their Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> This Gentleman ſurely could not but know, if he ever read any thing on the Presbyterian ſide of the Queſtion, that <hi>Jerom</hi> is not <hi>the chief Perſon</hi> they cite in their Cauſe. They have much greater depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon more primitive Writers, and as frequently quote <hi>Clemens Romanus, Polycarp, Juſtin Martyr, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus.</hi> And notwithſtanding the <hi>Conſtancy and Unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> he ſpeaks of, he has not ſeen good to bring one paſſage from either of theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> of the firſt and ſecond Centuries: nor dare he venture the Controverſy
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:003651_0060_10023C5B8D0FB060"/>upon their <hi>Judgment,</hi> or <hi>Account of facts.</hi> What he here ſays of <hi>Jerom,</hi> that <hi>he traces up Epiſcopacy to the very Apoſtles, and makes it their Inſtitution,</hi> is (to give it the ſofteſt) name, a palpable miſtake if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Jerom</hi> himſelf, whoſe opinion of this matter I ſhall give you in his own words. "<hi>And before there were parties in Religion by the Devil's inſtinct, and it was ſaid among the People, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>I am of</hi> Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, <hi>I of</hi> Cephas, <hi>the Churches were govern'd by the common Council of Presbyters. But after every one tho't thoſe he baptized to be rather his, than Chriſt's, it was determined in the whole World, that one of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould be ſet above the reſt, to whom all the care of the Church ſhould belong, and the ſeeds of Diviſion taken away. If</hi> ANY ONE SHOULD THINK IT OUR OPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NION AND NOT THAT OF THE SCRIPTURES, <hi>that Biſhops and Presbyter are the ſame, and that one is the name of Age and the other of Office, let him read &amp;c.</hi>— And here he quotes moſt of thoſe very Texts, which are urged by Presbyterians, to prove it the Doctrine of the Scripture, that Biſhop &amp; Presbyter are the ſame. Having done which, he adds, "<hi>Theſe things are alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we might ſhew that among the Ancients, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were the ſame with Biſhops; but by</hi> LITTLE AND LITTLE <hi>the whole care was devolved on one, that the Seeds of diſſention might be plucked up. As therefore the Presbyters know, that</hi> BY THE CUSTOM OF THE CHURCH, <hi>they are ſubject to him who is the Preſident; ſo let the</hi> BISHOPS KNOW, THAT THEY ARE ABOVE PRESBYTERS MORE BY THE CUSTOM OF THE CHURCH, THAN THE REAL APPOINTMENT OF THE LORD, <hi>and that they ought to rule the Church in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon—</hi>

So that unleſs we ſhould ſuppoſe this learned Father ſo very forgetful, as to be guilty of a groſs ſelf-contradiction within a few lines, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagined he is here to be underſtood as mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Ordination was <hi>always</hi> the peculiar work of Biſhops in diſtinction from Presbyters.

                     <p>Our Author having thus miſrepreſented the opinion of <hi>Jerom,</hi> its no wonder, in the next words, he ſhould do the ſame by Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi> He brings him in <q>own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus much at leaſt, that there were fix'd Biſhops in the days of one of the Apoſtles; that neither the Apoſtles nor any of their Diſciples, nor any Chriſtian or Heretick in the World, ſpoke or wrote a word againſt Epiſcopacy till long after it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſettled in the Churches.</q> Words to this purpoſe, I grant, are to be found in Mr. <hi>Baxter:</hi> But here lies the fallacy. This Gentleman is writing in
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:003651_0061_1002024A976F0218"/>favour of the Epiſcopacy of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and would make his Readers believe, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> had aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the univerſal prevalence of <hi>this Species</hi> of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Government; Whereas this is ſo far from the Truth, that this <hi>great Man</hi> really tho't <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy utterly ſubverſive of <hi>Parochial,</hi> which he not only affirms to be the only <hi>Scriptural</hi> and <hi>primitive</hi> Epiſcopacy; but has wrote a large Volume<note n="†" place="bottom">Treatiſe of Epiſcopacy.</note> to prove it, in oppoſition to that of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> Nor has his Treatiſe upon this Head ever yet received a juſt Anſwer, neither do I think it ever can.</p>
                     <p>He concludes this Paragraph with a Challenge, <q>to inſtance any Chriſtian Church for 1500 Years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Presbyters and Deacons ſubordinate to their Biſhop.</q> In anſwer whereto, I pitch upon <hi>every Church,</hi> within the two firſt Centuries, throughout the Chriſtian World, that we know any thing of, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and return back the Challenge, defying this Gentleman to produce, within the limits of this time, upon genuine Authority, one ſingle Church, that had in it Presbyters in Subordination to their Biſhop, <hi>after the manner of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. And I challenge him yet further, to produce, if he can, only a ſingle inſtance, within the ſame term, of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Ordination: which I the rather inſiſt upon, becauſe he makes this <hi>eſſential</hi> to the validity of Goſpel Adminiſtrations. Nor, unleſs he be able to bring an inſtance of <hi>this kind</hi> of Ordination, will he have much reaſon to boaſt of the <hi>unanimity</hi> of the primitive Fathers on this Point: and much leſs to make any further uſe of that trite ſaying of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> which without the leaſt appearance of truth, he cites in his Cauſe.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. When the epiſcopal <hi>Uſurpation</hi> began?</p>

                     <p n="4">4. Whether it can be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Presbyters</hi> then living, could be all, or moſt of them, ignorant of the Powers belonging to them of original Right?</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The firſt <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was but a <hi>claſſical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency,</hi> without any Pretence of <hi>Superiority</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Power;</hi> whence the <hi>Encroachments</hi> were made <hi>inſenſibly,</hi> and without Obſervation.

I Am now again called upon to conſider his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>Antiquity.</hi> "Had this Gentleman (ſays he, <hi>p.</hi> 45.) <q>been a little more inquiſitive, and not (depending upon the Authority of others) neglected examining the Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtolick Father,</hi> he might have met with one aſſerting the <hi>Superiority</hi> of <hi>Biſhops</hi> to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> by divine Right. To omit the plain and manifeſt Diſtinction he makes between them in every one of his Epiſtles, hear what he ſays, in that to the <hi>Philadelphians</hi> "For as many as are of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, are alſo with their <hi>Biſhop.</hi> Again, There is but one Fleſh of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and but one Cup in the Unity of his Blood, one Altar, as alſo there is one <hi>Biſhop.</hi> He compares the <hi>Biſhop</hi> to the Father, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Trallians.</hi> In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Magneſians,</hi> he exhorts them to reverence the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> according to the Power of God the Father.</q>—Our Author is ſo quick Sighted, it ſeems, as to find <hi>Ignatius</hi> here aſſerting the <hi>Superiority</hi> of Biſhops to Presbyters, by <hi>Divine Right.</hi> But I think there is nothing more plainly diſcoverable than the direct contrary to this, even from thoſe very Paſſages, now in view For,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. If <hi>Ignatius</hi> intends no more by <hi>Biſhop,</hi> but a <hi>Congregational Biſhop,</hi> or which is all one, but a meer <hi>Presbyter</hi> both in <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> I think his Patronage can be of but little Service to our Adverſaries. And this appears manifeſt, from this Gentleman's own Conceſſions. For he grants, that <q>
                           <hi>Presbyters</hi> are thoſe Church-Officers, that are called <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the New Teſtament,</q>

Now if <hi>Ignatius</hi> was an <hi>Apoſtolical Father</hi> (as he calls him) what Reaſon can be given, why he did not uſe the Word <hi>Biſhop</hi> in the ſame Senſe, that the Apoſtles uſed it? My Antagoniſt grants <q>that the Duties and Qualifications of thoſe called <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the New Teſtament, and of thoſe called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> are the ſame.</q> And why are not the Duties and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations

Verily 'twould tempt one to think ſo, when we find him ſpeaking of <hi>their coming all into one Place;</hi> aſſerting <hi>that he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to the ſame Place, is proud and condemneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and exhorting <hi>all to come together, as into the Temple of God, as unto one Altar.</hi>

I anſwer, They were <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders.</hi> For tho' they are often conſider'd in theſe Epiſtles, as being concern'd in Government, yet never as having any Authority to <hi>preach,</hi> or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Nay, we are expreſly told, that <hi>it is not lawful to baptize without the Biſhop,</hi> as was obſerved before.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

Tho', it has been abundantly proved by many learned Men, that they are all ſpurious, or vilely interpolated: The Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this is at our Author's Service, when he'll be pleaſed to call for it. And thus I have paſſed the Pikes of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epiſtles; and have given a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Anſwer to all this Gentleman's fine Flouriſhes, about the <hi>Neceſſity of depending upon the Fathers, is a ſimple Matter of Fact:</hi> For it would have been ſoon enough for his pathetical Harangue, when he had firſt proved from the truly <hi>primitive Fathers,</hi> not that there were then <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the Church (this is acknowledged on both Sides) But that theſe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>However, he has here one Thing more, I will beſtow ſome Obſervations upon. I had adduc'd ſeveral <hi>Canons,</hi> agreed on at the 4th, Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> Upon which the Gentleman obſerves (<hi>p.</hi> 47.) <q>And what then? therefore Prebyters can ordain! no ſuch thing.</q> If he had caſt the ſlighteſt glance on that part of the <hi>Dialogue,</hi> he might have ſeen, that thoſe <hi>Canons</hi> were bro't, not to prove Ordination by Presbyters, but that there was not in that day "ſo great a diſtance between Biſhops and Presbyters, as there is now; and that nothing was done without the mutual concurrence of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with their Preſident": which ſtands validly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from thoſe Canons, notwithſtanding his remark. But perhaps my Opponent wanted an Opportunity to introduce that Apoſtolical Canon (as 'tis call'd) <hi>"Let a Biſhop be ordained by two or three Biſhops, a Prieſt by one Biſhop, and ſo likewiſe a Deacon";</hi> and to let us know

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Ears of Corn, or Grapes, 'tis not lawful to offer any thing upon the Altar, ſave only Oyl for the holy Lamps, and incenſe in time of divine Oblation.</hi> Can. 13. <hi>He that hath been twice married after Baptiſm, or hath had a Concubine, cannot be a Biſhop or Presbyter, or at all in the Catalogue of the Prieſthood.</hi> Can. 19. <hi>Of thoſe who were ſingle Perſons, when they were made Clergymen, we command that only Readers and Singers may take Wives.</hi> Can. 23. <hi>If any Biſhop has made uſe of the Princes of this World, and by their influence has got into the Church, let him be depoſed, and all that communicate with him.</hi> Can. 64. <hi>If any one of the Clergy or Laity ſhall take from the holy Church, either Wax or Oyl, let him be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and add a fifth part to what he took away.</hi> Can. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I ſhall take leave upon this occaſion to deſire this Gentleman's Reſolution of one or two Queſtions, viz. Whether the <hi>twenty third</hi> among the Apoſtolical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, be not of as good Authority as the <hi>firſt?</hi> And if it be, whether there be not juſt the ſame reaſon, that <hi>all the Biſhops in England ſhould at once be depoſed, and all in Communion with them,</hi> as that Presbyterians ſhould ſubmit to Epiſcopal Ordination? And if the <hi>thirteenth</hi> and <hi>nineteenth</hi> Canons are of any validity, whether moſt of the Clergy of the eſtabliſh'd Church,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:003651_0065_10023CA137FB6008"/>do not ſtand as much condemned by them, as others do by the <hi>firſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall only add, 'tis a ſhameful piece of Conduct in thoſe of the <hi>Church,</hi> who call upon us to expreſs our Regards to ſuch of thoſe Canons, as they think favour their Cauſe; while at the ſame time they treat moſt of theſe very Canons with the utmoſt practical Contempt. Let them lead in a punctual obſervance of them all, and then we may poſſibly think them ſerious, when they recommend ſome of them to our Conſideration.</p>
                     <p>WE now come to his laſt <hi>Propoſition.</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 48.) <q>That, ſuppoſing all the Arguments urged in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Presbyterian Ordination,</hi> were inconteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true; yet modern <hi>Presbyterian Ordination</hi> muſt be null and void." In Proof of which he tells us, 'Tis too well known to require Proof, that the true ſtate of the Controverſy, between us and the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> depends upon the State of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office, at the Time of the Reformation. —The Queſtion is not, whether ſuch as were called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in the Times of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had the Power of Ordination: but the Queſtion we are concerned about is this, whether ſuch as were called <hi>Presbyters,</hi> at the Time of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> had the Power of Ordination.</q> That they had not, he ſuppoſes evident; becauſe <q>
                           <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> alone were ſome hundred Years before the <hi>Reformation,</hi> inveſted with the Power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q> But then the Queſtion recurs, What were theſe <hi>Biſhops?</hi> Were they by <hi>Divine Right ſuperiour</hi> to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> or not? If they were, let him prove it. If they were not, the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> was <hi>all this while</hi> in the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> whether they exerciſed it or not. If theſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> had the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Ordination</hi> themſelves, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> ordained by them <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:003651_0065_10023CA137FB6008"/>all</hi> the Authority <hi>appointed by Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> to thoſe of their Order: and conſequently had the Power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> according to the original Inſtitution, <hi>inherent</hi> in them; by what <hi>Uſurpation</hi> ſoever they were kept from the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves, among whom was the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of Biſhops he pleads for, did not pretend to the <hi>divine</hi> Right of Epiſcopacy; They ſuppoſed Biſhop and Presbyter to be the <hi>ſame Order</hi> by original Right: and therefore their <hi>Presbyters</hi> were by their own Principles, ordained to all the Powers that belonged to <hi>Biſhops</hi> This our Author himſelf reminds us of, <hi>p.</hi> 27. <q>This very Argument (ſays he) do the Papiſts uſe, to prove the Sameneſs of Biſhops and Presbyters, as to Order.</q> Now then if Presbyters were of the ſame Order with Biſhops, not only by Divine Inſtitution, but even in the Opinion of their <hi>Ordainers,</hi> what will become of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Reaſoning under this Propoſition. And this was the Opinion of the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> every where, at the Time of the <hi>Reformation:</hi> not only the foreign Churches, who carried on the <hi>Reformation</hi> without their <hi>Biſhops;</hi> but even in <hi>England</hi> it ſelf; as may be ſeen at large, in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to the firſt Volume of Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> and in the eighth Chapter of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet's</hi>

<pb n="126" facs="unknown:003651_0066_10023CB25FF7AF70"/>
                        <hi>Reformation.</hi> The firſt Perſon, that ventured publickly to aſſert the <hi>divine</hi> Right of Epiſcopacy, was <hi>Dr. Bancroft,</hi> then Chaplain to the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> in a Sermon at <hi>Paul's Croſs,</hi> Jan. 12. 1588. He declared, that <q>the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were a diſtinct Order from <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and had Superiority over them <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and directly from God.</q> This made a great Noiſe, and gave great Offence to many of the Clergy. Sir <hi>Francis Knolles,</hi> Treaſurer of the Queen's Houſhold, had this much at Heart; and ſuppoſed, that <hi>if the Biſhops were not under go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, to her Majeſty, of the Clergy, but ſuperiour Governours over their Brethren, by God's Ordinance; it will then follow, that her Majeſty is not ſuperiour Governours over her Clergy.</hi> He writ to the learned Dr. <hi>Raynolds</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for his Opinion of <hi>Bancroft's</hi> Doctrine, who largely and learnedly refuted it. And <hi>Arch-Biſhop Whitgift</hi> himſelf (notwithſtanding his imperial and lordly Behaviour) ſaid, He rather wiſhed, than believed it to be true (<hi>Neal</hi>'s Hiſt of Purit <hi>p.</hi> 494.) Such an <hi>upſtart</hi> Doctrine is the <hi>divine</hi> Right of <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, Sir, I have diſtinctly conſidered all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for <hi>Prelacy,</hi> advanced by this Author: and muſt leave it to your Judgment, whether it be not a full and ſufficient Anſwer; and whether we have not Cauſe (notwithſtanding <q>the Inferences of a ſevere Aſpect and harſh Sound,</q> which this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman would draw from our <hi>Ordinations</hi>) to comfort our ſelves, with the Expectation of Chriſt's promiſed Preſence with us, in the faithful Diſcharge of our Miniſtry; and of his Bleſſing upon his Ordinances by us adminiſtred.</p>

                  <p>IT was ſome time after the foregoing Piece was in the Printer's hand, that we were ſaluted with <hi>another Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi> between <hi>Prelaticus</hi> and <hi>Elutherius,</hi> bearing the Title of <hi>ELEUTHERIUS ENERVATUS</hi> &amp;c.

However, that the Gentlemen concern'd therein, might not complain of any Neglect, nor have the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of glorying (as their manner is) "in a Book <hi>never anſwer'd,</hi>" a little Pains have been beſtow'd in ſome Remarks on their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, which are exhibited to the Publick in the following Pages.</p>
                  <p>It was thought convenient, that the Replications to both the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Anſwers ſhould be publiſh'd under one Cover. But by reaſon of <hi>Elutherius</hi>'s Diſtance from the Preſs, we could not expect ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably to receive his Reply to this other Anſwer.

                     </p>
                     <p>The firſt Argument he pitches on, is what <hi>Elutherius</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally ſuggeſted (<hi>Dial.</hi> p. 5.) That <q>
                           <hi>a Prelate at beſt is but a human Creature, and not of Chriſt's Appointing.</hi>
                        </q> This indeed was deſign'd more immediately againſt the <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and Juriſdiction of the Biſhops. But <hi>Euſebius</hi> (p. 26.) ſays <q>
                           <hi>Tis certain it was deſign'd for a Slur upon Epiſcopal</hi> ORDINATION;</q> and makes a mighty Improvement of the harmleſs Paſſage, inſinuating, as if <hi>Elutherius</hi> intended to argue, that <q>
                           <hi>a Biſhop or Prelate can have no Power to</hi> Ordain; <hi>becauſe being a mere</hi> humane <hi>Creature himſelf, he can't make a</hi> Divine <hi>one,</hi> i. e. <hi>a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Upon which he exclaims, <hi>If</hi> Eleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius <hi>ſtrikes thus high, he will</hi> UNDO <hi>us all,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now in Anſwer to theſe Remarks, I'll attempt two Things—</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To point out ſeveral <hi>Senſes,</hi> in which <hi>Elutherius</hi>'s Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition may be ſafely underſtood, and in which it muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be <hi>true.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here let it be obſerv'd, the Prelate ſpoken of is of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stamp, a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhop; and now I ſay, <hi>this</hi> Prelate at beſt is but a human Creature, as deriving his whole Power from <hi>human</hi> Conſtitutions, having no external Juriſdiction but what he derives from the <hi>State,</hi> &amp; dependent upon the <hi>Crown</hi> for his very Being. The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>We know that an Idol is nothing in the World:</hi> So I may ſay of Prelacy, <hi>We know</hi> it <hi>is nothing in the World,</hi> in point of Divine Right. Juſt as our Author (I hope) would ſay of the Romiſh <hi>Papacy,</hi> it is at beſt a mere human Creature; ſo ſay we of Engliſh <hi>Prelacy:</hi> which is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly founded upon, and directed and limited by the Laws of the Nation. Some of the beſt Defenders of Epiſcopacy have
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003651_0078_10023C609C9F7038"/>acknowledg'd, there's no ſuch Thing as a ſtrictly <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to be found in <hi>Scripture:</hi> and if this Prelatical Power be not from the Laws of God, it muſt derive from the Civil Magiſtrate and Laws of the State. <q>And indeed what is it (as one obſerves) that the Civil Magiſtrate may not do in the making of a Prelate in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> He may <hi>elect</hi> the Perſon, and does ſo in Reality; for he nominates authoritatively. He may <hi>multiply</hi> Biſhops <hi>ad libitum;</hi> and if he pleaſes, may appoint one in every Pariſh. He may alſo <hi>delegate</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> to whom he pleaſes: for the <hi>Lay-Chancellors,</hi> who judicially excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate or abſolve, have their Commiſſion to do it from the <hi>King,</hi> not from the Biſhop; and in ſome places the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Juriſdiction is reſerved to a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> as in the <hi>Peculiars,</hi> they have in divers Parts of <hi>England:</hi> A certain Proof, that the Biſhop's Juriſdiction is only by human Right. Laſtly, the Civil Magiſtrate may alſo <hi>depoſe</hi> and deprive Biſhops, when they ſee juſt Cauſe: and this Power has been ſo lately exerted, that it needs no further Proof. I would fain know whether the <hi>deprived Biſhops</hi> were not diveſted of <hi>all</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction. That which induces me to mention this is, I find the Defenders of the Hierarchy confidently aſſert, that <hi>there can be but one Biſhop</hi> in one Church at the ſame time: therefore if the former were <hi>not diveſted of their Power,</hi> I ſee not how the ſucceeding Incumbents <hi>could have any</hi> by their own Rule; and ſo <hi>their Ordinations</hi> would be <hi>null,</hi> if the <hi>others</hi> be <hi>valid.</hi> To ſay, that the depriv'd Prelates had the <hi>Power</hi> ſtill, but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from the Exerciſe of it, would be to confront the Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> [in the Caſe of the Biſhops depos'd at the Revolution] which ſays expreſly, they are deprived of <hi>their Office,</hi> and diſtinguiſhes betwixt being <hi>ſuſpended</hi> from the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of their Office, and being <hi>deprived</hi> of the <hi>Office</hi> it ſelf.—Upon the whole matter I think it is clear enough, that the Engliſh Prelacy is a <hi>meer Creature</hi> of the <hi>Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,</hi> who may make every <hi>Parſon</hi> of a Pariſh a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> if he pleaſes; their whole Power (as diſtinct from Presbyters) being founded upon the Laws of the Land.</q> — Thus the learned Mr. <hi>Tong,</hi> in his ingenious Defence of Mr. <hi>H's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi> (p. 53, to 60.) where this grand Point is largely argu'd, and Objections anſwer'd.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps it will tend more to <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Conviction, if I produce one of his <hi>own Authors.</hi> This therefore I will do,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003651_0078_10023C609C9F7038"/>and I pitch upon Bp. <hi>Hoadly;</hi> who in his elaborate.

                           </gap>r</hi>'s PRESERVATIVE, p. 9. &amp;c. p. 33, &amp;c.) furniſhes us with a fair Key (very nigh the ſame with that of Mr. <hi>Tong</hi>) to that myſtical Paſſage of <hi>Elutherius.</hi> He has learnedly demonſtrated, that the Biſhops <hi>Right</hi> of executing their Office ariſeth from an <hi>human</hi> Original, i. e. the <hi>Nomination</hi> of the Civil Magiſtrate. <q>This Nomination (ſays he) is veſted in the <hi>Crown</hi> by the <hi>Laws:</hi> and is ultimately reſolv'd into the ſupreme Authority of the <hi>Nation:</hi> Conſequently, therefore, what is <hi>given,</hi> may be <hi>taken away,</hi> by the <hi>ſame Authority</hi> &amp;c." And it's remarkable "The words of the <hi>Act</hi> (ſays he) declare them [i. e. the <hi>Biſhops</hi> deprived] to be <hi>depriv'd</hi> from their OFFICES, as well as their Dignities" &amp;c.— And therefore it was "A <hi>total</hi> Deprivation, and made them <hi>ceaſe to be Biſhops,</hi> as to any RIGHT (properly ſo called) of executing their Offices.</q> Now my Remark upon it is, That this plainly argues an <hi>Engliſh Prelate</hi> in Effect to be (in <hi>Elutherius</hi>'s terrible Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) <hi>at beſt but a human Creature;</hi> It ſhows, that Prelacy is in the Eye of the Civil Magiſtrate, and in Fact and Practice, but an accidental human Creation only. This is a Concluſion, that ſeems to me to follow from the Premiſes, as naturally and clearly as Light from the Sun. However at leaſt it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears evident "beyond the Poſſibility of a Reply"(to uſe a High Church Phraſe) that an Engliſh Prelate at the <hi>worſt,</hi> that is, a <hi>depriv'd Biſhop,</hi> is even at the beſt but a human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; unable, if he has any <hi>latent</hi> Power, to put it in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, or perform any regular and (and in the Eye of the Law) valid Act of Authority, in point of Ordination or Juriſdiction. And <hi>if ſo,</hi> I fear me, this STRIKES HIGH indeed, and caſts an odious Reflection ſomewhere, even upon <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</hi> Now let <hi>Euſebius</hi> turn the Fury of his ſevere Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from <hi>Elutherius,</hi> and fall foul on his own Advocate the Biſhop, for "<hi>deſigning to caſt a</hi> SLUR <hi>upon Ordinations,</hi> upon <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Ordinations" too (which it verily ſeems he has done in fact) and that the blackeſt of Slurs, upon ſome of 'em; even "the infamous Blot of <hi>Uſurpation</hi> without a true Right."</p>
                     <p>But further I will lay before <hi>Euſebius</hi> one Conſideration, that may ſerve as an <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> upon the Point we have in hand. I conclude, this Gentleman himſelf will confeſs, that an Engliſh <hi>Prelate</hi> is at beſt but a mere <hi>human Creature,</hi> if it can be prov'd he has no authentick <hi>Epiſcopal
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003651_0079_10023C574D55D568"/>Conſecration;</hi> which it will appear, upon <hi>his</hi> Principles, no Biſhop in <hi>England</hi> at this day has a juſt Claim to, if it can be made out, that there has been a <hi>Breach</hi> of regular <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> at any time, evident and notorious. Now that there was in fact ſuch a <hi>Breach,</hi> even at the <hi>Reformation,</hi> I vouch in an <hi>Epiſcopal Author</hi> for my Witneſs; whoſe Authority, Argument and Advice may have ſome Weight with this Gentleman. See a LETTER <hi>to the Rev.</hi> Mr. PEERS, <hi>Vicar of</hi> Faringdon, <hi>By a</hi> CLERGYMAN (<hi>London,</hi> printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1716.) Of which one informs us, "It deſervedly met with good Acceptance from the World." There you will find the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Paragraphs. (<hi>p.</hi> 43. and onwards.) <q>We have been taught, I know, to aſſert the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a <hi>Succeſſion</hi> from the Apoſtles: but if that is to be done at all, it ſhou'd be done with <hi>Caution,</hi> even in our Sermons, but never in Print, becauſe that <hi>Succeſſion</hi> muſt be deriv'd thro' the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, which has been divided into great <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and at laſt was ſo <hi>corrupted,</hi> ſo chang'd from the Model of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that we were forc'd to <hi>ſeparate</hi> from her. And when we did ſo, <hi>how</hi> was the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> preſerv'd!— Perhaps you have not read this Part of our Hiſtory, and therefore I'll ſet down a Paſſage or two from Bp. BURNET'S <hi>Hiſtory of the Reformation,</hi> with my own Obſervations, which you may peruſe at your Leaſure.</q> I ſhall for Brevity leave out the hiſtorical Paſſages he quotes at large, yet referring to the Places, where he ſays they may be found; <hi>Vol.</hi> II. <hi>Fol.</hi> 378, 396, 402, 403. — And only give you in Parentheſes, what is neceſſary to clear the <hi>Clergyman</hi>'s Obſervations upon 'em, which are theſe.

Certainly, my Friend, if as a <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſor</hi> you are of a LAY-<hi>Extract,</hi> you can't as a <hi>Chriſtian Miniſter</hi> challenge any higher Original. You may well look on your ſelf ſtill, notwithſtanding your Epiſcopal Orders, but <hi>a pretending Laick,</hi> as much as before. Surely you muſt needs receive Conviction by this, that <hi>Reſpectively</hi> to You, at leaſt a <hi>Prelate is at beſt but a human Creature:</hi> for it was impoſſible for him to make a <hi>Divine</hi> one of <hi>You;</hi> I mean, of one in your <hi>Circumſtances;</hi> a mere <hi>human</hi> Creature, without <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Baptiſm. Read now, and apply to your ſelf what you find pertinent to your Caſe, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17—23.</p>
                     <p>It remains, that we conſider the <hi>Prelates</hi> in Relation to <hi>us,</hi> the Miniſters and Churches of <hi>New England.</hi> I premiſe this Obſervation, That a <hi>Prelate</hi> is a relative Term, and (as one expreſſes it) <hi>always connotes a</hi> BISHOPRICK, <hi>as his Charge and Cure.</hi> The Prelate's Power is limited, and none is <hi>Biſhop of another Man's Dioceſe,</hi> nor can the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops diſplay their Power in ſuch Parts even of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as are <hi>exempted</hi> by Law from Prelatical Juriſdiction, and govern'd by Courts held by dignify'd <hi>Presbyters.</hi> The Bp. (notwithſtanding his ſpecious Title of <hi>chief</hi> Governor) paſſes but for a mere <hi>human Creature</hi> in the <hi>Peculiars:</hi> and why ſhou'd he paſs for any other among us in <hi>New-England,</hi> who are at leaſt as much privileg'd as they! Certainly the <hi>Regal</hi> Authority, having the Right of <hi>Nomination,</hi> has equal Pretences to the Right of <hi>Suſpenſion:</hi> the ſame Authority that gives the <hi>Power</hi> of external Juriſdiction, may lay what <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction</hi> is thought fit, on the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of it, either total or

So that altho' in a <hi>Civil</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration we are <hi>dependent</hi> Provinces, and gladly will ever remain ſo (loyal to the Crown, and dutiful to the Mother-Kingdom) yet we are (in fact and right) independent <hi>Churches;</hi> by the Royal Indulgence, reſign'd to a perfect Liberty in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Regards. Surely the Prelates are all in Effect DEPRIV'D <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as to <hi>us;</hi> depriv'd by a moſt ſufficient Authority, to all Intents and Purpoſes. But if I am ſo very <hi>unhappy</hi> as to have been miſtaken, I deſire <hi>Euſebius</hi> to be ſo kind, as to ſet me right, and inform us WHOSE <hi>Dioceſe</hi> we pertain to, that we may be no longer ignorant <hi>who</hi> is our Bp. Will he undertake to decide the grand Diſpute at this day between the Bp. of <hi>London,</hi> and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury!</hi> For my own part, I know of no Act of Parliament, that veſts the Title in the Bp. of <hi>London;</hi> without which, his Claim is merely preſumptive. But it may be, this Gentleman will think it his wiſeſt way, to ſay, we are as yet only ſubject to the <hi>Archiepiſcopal</hi> Juriſdiction, like the Peculiars in <hi>England.</hi> Well, to this it's anſwered, <q>
                           <hi>They are no otherwiſe under it</hi> (and conſequently <hi>we</hi> are no more under it) <hi>than even the</hi> BI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHOPS <hi>are: and the prelatical Party themſelves acknowledge, that Archbiſhops are but of Human Inſtitution.</hi>
                        </q> We may therefore without all hazard, conclude, that a <hi>Prelate</hi> is at beſt but a human Creature <hi>Reſpectively,</hi> &amp; in Relation to us Whether you look upon him in a Legal or an Eccleſiaſtical Conſideration, he is unto <hi>us,</hi> I ſay, <hi>at beſt a more human Creature.</hi>

                     <p>Upon the whole then, what has this Writer got by his noiſy Buſtle and Outcry againſt that hurtleſs Paſſage of <hi>Elutherius!</hi> Here indeed we have <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Maſter-Objection, and what he values himſelf moſt upon; or to allude to a Phraſe of his own, <hi>"triumphs upon, as the foundation of the fineſt Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in his Dialogues."</hi> But I flatter my ſelf, the Flowers are cropt and ſpoil'd, and his Triumphs at an End.</p>

                           <hi>what</hi> Eleutherius <hi>has ſaid againſt the Epiſcopal</hi> CONSTITUTION,</q> (p. 24) yet quickly forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, and reſolv'd upon a perverſe Comment, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards treats the diſputed Sentence as <hi>particularly</hi> referring to ORDINATION, and has the Front to ſay to <hi>Elutherius</hi> (p. 26.) <q>
                           <hi>It is</hi> CERTAIN, <hi>You deſign'd a Slur upon our Ordination among your vulgar Readers, by your unfair Inſinuation, when you call a Prelate a human Creature, and your Ordinations ſuch as are according to Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> p. 9. <hi>as though ours were not ſo.</hi>

                     <p>Well! Nevertheleſs, to give him the faireſt Play he can deſire, I will for once ſuppoſe <hi>Elutherius</hi>'s Words to come in under the head of <hi>Ordination,</hi> as an Objection againſt the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal</hi> Way.

                           <hi>God</hi> is juſt, and equal, and good: and, as ſure as He is ſo, He cannot put the Salvation and Happineſs of <hi>any Man,</hi> upon what He himſelf hath put it out of the Power of <hi>any Man</hi> upon Earth, to be intirely ſatisfied in.</p>
                        <p>It hath not pleaſed God, in his <hi>Providence,</hi> to keep up any Proof of the <hi>leaſt Probability,</hi> or <hi>moral</hi> POSSIBILITY, of a <hi>Regular Uninterrupted Succeſſion.</hi> But there is a great Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and humanely ſpeaking, a <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Contrary; that this <hi>Succeſſion</hi> hath been often <hi>interrupted:</hi> eſpecially in the Opinion of THOSE, who maintain all <hi>Lay-Baptiſms,</hi> and all Offices performed by Perſons, that either have been <hi>irregularly ordained,</hi> or have <hi>forged</hi> their Pretenſions to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be more NULLITIES: there having been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a <hi>great Number</hi> of ſuch like Inſtances.</p>

                        <p>The <hi>Advocates</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore, are ſo wiſe, as to turn theſe Principles of ſome <hi>profeſs'd Proteſtants</hi> to their own Account; and delude many weak Minds, of ſuch as have been firſt deluded by our <hi>Nonjurors.</hi>—All this may, methinks (as he goes on, <hi>p.</hi> 87, 88.) ſerve to alarm our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,</hi> upon <hi>their own Principles,</hi> about the Danger, <hi>their own Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is in, by <hi>their way of Proceeding.</hi> And perhaps <hi>They,</hi> who ſeem to have but a very <hi>faint Notion</hi> of the <hi>Honour</hi> of GOD, and the <hi>Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> any farther than they ſuppoſe them to go, hand in hand, with <hi>their own</hi> particular <hi>Sect,</hi> and Church, may receive the firſt.

                        <p>And as I am ſure (ſays he, <hi>p.</hi> 98.) that it is <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>honeſt,</hi> to ſpeak thus plainly; and to inculcate this upon <hi>You:</hi> So I am as ſure, it is the only certain Method of preventing, or expelling the POISON of <hi>Thoſe,</hi> who are <hi>gone out from us, becauſe they were not of us.</hi>

Thus the very Biſhop, that <hi>Euſebius</hi> juſt now made his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peal</hi> to, has turn'd all his own Artillery againſt him and his Party: and verily they had need have Backs of Steel, as well as Faces of Braſs, to bear ſuch a ſcourge, and ſtand it out after ſo ſevere a whipping. The Biſhop, you ſee, has laid down <hi>Premiſes,</hi> and drawn <hi>Concluſions,</hi> which <hi>ſtrike</hi> as <hi>high,</hi> and as deep too, as that hated Paſſage of <hi>Elutherius</hi>'s; at which this Gentleman ſtarted, &amp; made the fearful Exclamation, "<hi>Eluthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> will UNDO US ALL." I may ſurely return him his own words (<hi>p.</hi> 27.) and let him ſee how he likes them, coming from <hi>my</hi> hand: <q>

                        </q> upon ſubmitting the preſent Diſpute to the Deciſion of your choſen Epiſcopal Umpire.

                        </q> Nevertheleſs (I ſay) the Diſtinction is <hi>not</hi> ſufficiently ſignify'd, if this Name <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was <hi>never</hi> given, in the appropriate Senſe of the word, to <hi>ſome</hi> that he ſuppoſes to be of that ſuperior Order. The Occaſion of my mentioning this is, It's remarkable, that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy,</hi> joyning together in ſeveral Epiſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> in the Superſcription aſſumes to himſelf the ſtyle of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> but leaves out <hi>Timothy</hi>'s apoſtolical Character. Now, I pray the Reaſon. Muſt we not fetch it from that Scripture, <hi>Are all Apoſtles? Are all Evangeliſts?</hi>— I add, Neither was the Imparity ſufficiently diſtinguiſh'd, altho' the name <hi>Apoſtle</hi> might never be us'd in Common; BECAUSE the Word <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt</hi> was certainly us'd <hi>as little</hi> in Common; and yet our Adverſaries plead, that <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> were not a <hi>diſtinct Order.</hi> Much leſs will it appear, that the Imparity was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003651_0089_10023CA8F3E2C6A0"/>notify'd, if the Name <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was ſometimes apply'd in a <hi>common</hi> Senſe, to ſuch as it does not appear were of that ſuperior Order he ſpeaks of, I mean of the ſame Claſs with the <hi>Twelve.</hi> If <hi>Silas</hi> be any where honour'd with the Title of <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> it muſt be meant only in a <hi>common</hi> Senſe: for we read, he was only one of the <hi>chief Men among the Brethren,</hi> and diſtinguiſh'd from <hi>the Apoſtles,</hi> when this Appellation is us'd in its appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Senſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.22.—If <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> are call'd <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> 'tis only as they were Meſſengers of the Churches. And if <hi>Timothy</hi> was an Apoſtle, I demand that <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſhew us in him <hi>the Signs of an Apoſtle.</hi>—In fine, I obſerve We are not ſufficiently inform'd, That what <hi>Superiority</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; the <hi>Twelve,</hi> appear to have had over Paſtors and Churches, was the Reſult ſtrictly of their <hi>Commiſſion-Power,</hi> and not rather of ſome peculiar <hi>inſpired Gifts,</hi> which gave them a Preheminence. So that their <hi>Example</hi> is not ſufficient to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of a <hi>ſtanding,</hi> Imparity. And then ſuppoſing a perpetual Imparity admitted, what muſt it be? An Imparity of <hi>Order,</hi> or of <hi>Degree</hi> only? It's obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, Mr. HOOKER (<hi>Pol.</hi> p 417.) ſays, <q>The whole Bodie of the Church being divided into <hi>Laitie</hi> and <hi>Cleargie,</hi> the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie are either <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Deacons.</hi>
                        </q> So again (p. 421.) <q>All whom the Church did ordain, were either to ſerve as <hi>Presbyters</hi> or as <hi>Deacons.</hi>
                        </q> Tho' he is of Opinion (as he expreſſes it, <hi>p.</hi> 419.) <q>Of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ſome were <hi>greater,</hi> ſome <hi>leſſe</hi> in power, and that by our Saviour's own Appointment.</q> He makes <q>the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> peculiar Charge to be <hi>this,</hi> to publiſh the Goſpell of Chriſt unto <hi>all Nations,</hi> &amp; to <hi>deliver</hi> them his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances received by <hi>immediate Revelation from Himſelfe.</hi> Which Preeminence excepted (ſays he) to all other Offices and Duties incident into their Order, it was in them to ordaine and conſecrate whomſoever they thought meete</q> &amp;c. He tells us (p. 421.) <q>
                           <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> were <hi>Presbyters</hi> of principall Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie, whom the Apoſtles ſent abroad, and uſed as Agents in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, whereſoever they ſaw need. <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias, Apollos,</hi> TIMOTHY were <hi>thus</hi> imployed.— Finally, <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> what other were they than <hi>Presbyters</hi> alſo? Howbeit <hi>ſetled</hi> in ſome <hi>certaine Charge,</hi> and <hi>thereby</hi> differing from <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi>
                        </q> And he uſes that peculiar Phraſe elſe-where (<hi>p.</hi> 436.) "<hi>Biſhops,</hi>—and OTHER <hi>Presbyters.</hi>" So that, upon the whole, it is plain, Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> makes them all <hi>radically</hi> and eſſentially <hi>one Order;</hi> not different <hi>Species</hi> of Miniſters, having <hi>eſſentially diverſe</hi> Rights, Powers and Buſineſſes,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:003651_0090_10023C73A0653680"/>but fundamentally one and the ſame Order of Miniſters; tho' with ſome. Variation as to <hi>Degrees,</hi> and <hi>Ways</hi> of exerciſing their <hi>common</hi> Rights and Powers, yet this merely for <hi>Order</hi>'s ſake. The Diſtinction between Biſhops and other <hi>Presbyters,</hi> he calls it a <hi>"Difference of Paſtors":</hi> and only ſuppoſes <q>
                           <hi>It ought to be, when they grow to any great Multitude,</hi>

                           <hi>I ſee nothing that forbids;</hi>

(p. 108, <hi>to</hi> 113.) Only I muſt crave Leave to put a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt</hi> to the Gentleman, which is, That he wou'd inform us particularly what he <hi>means</hi> by that critical Paſſage (<hi>p.</hi> 47.)

                     <p>I paſs to obſerve; we have next (from <hi>p.</hi> 48, to 53) a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate upon that noted Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.25, 26. which <hi>Eluthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> in his Dialogue (<hi>p.</hi> 6, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>if we will
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:003651_0093_10023CABF67471E8"/>but allow</hi> Biſhops <hi>to have a lawful Claim to ſo much Authority, as the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>exercis'd (who it can't be ſuppos'd were ſo wicked, as to take upon themſelves a forbidden Authority) he will contend for no more in their behalf as Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Miniſters. This,</hi> ſay's he, <hi>will ſufficiently preſerve their Supremacy</hi> &amp;c—<hi>The Biſhops may keep their Mitres, and all the Authority they now enjoy in our Church.</hi>
                        </q> Well, to cut ſhort the Diſpute, I will for once grant this Gentleman the whole of his Demand, viz. That <hi>Biſhops</hi> ſhall have <hi>as much</hi> Authority (and <hi>no more</hi>) as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> exercis'd. But then it will be a Queſtion, <hi>What</hi> was that Authority the Apoſtles exercis'd? Did they exerciſe any <hi>Coercive</hi> Authority in matters of Religion? It ſeems they expreſly diſclaim it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24 — Did they exerciſe a <hi>Temporal</hi> Authority, a <hi>ſecular</hi> Dominion over their Brethren? It ſeems they renounce it, in ſaying, <hi>Our Weapons are not carnal.</hi> Did they hold Epiſcopal <hi>Courts,</hi> and practiſe ſuch Forms of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> as are in the <hi>ſpiritual Courts</hi> of this Age? <q>Where, inſtead of the Diſcipline inſtituted by Chriſt, the Church-Offender is carry'd from Court to Court at intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Charges, ſubjected to heavy Fines, exorbitant Fees, or Impriſonment &amp;c.</q> Theſe Objections <hi>Elutherius</hi>'s Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue had laid in this Gentleman's way: and I preſume he had an Eye to theſe in that guarded Expreſſion, <q>
                           <hi>So much Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as the Apoſtles exerciſed, we will contend for no more in the Biſhops behalf</hi> AS <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
                        </q> Now I put it to him to ſay, whether the Authority of the Prelacy, in thoſe Points a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovemention'd, be not <hi>more</hi> than what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> exercis'd; and whether ſuch as exerciſe this Authority, do not do it <hi>as Chriſt's Miniſters:</hi> and how they that <hi>as Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Miniſters</hi> do exerciſe <hi>more</hi> Authority, than the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, can be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd in being <hi>ſo wicked as to take upon themſelves a forbidden Authority:</hi> For if <q>
                           <hi>this Inſtruction of our Lord</hi> (in <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.) <hi>was intended</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>to direct the Conduct of his Miniſters</hi>
                        </q> and if <hi>"the Apoſtles have ſet an Example to their Followers;"</hi> Then certainly the <hi>ſecular</hi> Authority of the Biſhops, and the Authority of the <hi>ſpiritual Courts,</hi> is a <hi>forbidden Authority;</hi> and they muſt be <hi>wicked,</hi> who take it upon them. Now, Euſebius, pray be plain and honeſt, and don't <hi>ſhuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Remark (<hi>p.</hi> 52.) <q>
                           <hi>which he ſpeaks by way of</hi> Negation, <hi>not Prohibition,</hi>
                        </q> 'tis a groundleſs Diſtinction. For the Apoſtles in part explain'd our Lord's Intention, when they ſaid, <hi>It is not Reaſon, that we ſhou'd leave the word of God and ſerve Tables.</hi> Much leſs Reaſon is there that Biſhops ſhou'd leave the word of God, to ſerve as <hi>Lord Treaſurers,</hi> as ſome of 'em have done, or to ſerve in <hi>Parliament,</hi> as they all (but one) do. I ſee no poſſible means to reconcile their Practice to that of the Apoſtles, <hi>who gave themſelves continually to Prayer and to the Miniſtry of the Word:</hi> nor is their Conduct reconcilable to the Duty charg'd on Biſhop TIMOTHY; <hi>Neglect not the Gift that is in Thee; Meditate on theſe Things; give thy ſelf</hi> WHOLLY <hi>to them; Preach the Word, be inſtant in Seaſon, out of Seaſon. Endure Hardneſs, as a good Soldier of Jeſus Chriſt: No Man that warteth, intangleth himſelf with the Affairs of this Life.</hi> Theſe Divine Precepts and Prohibitions neceſſarily caſhier the Biſhop of his <hi>Court-Employments,</hi> and <hi>ſecular Lordſhip.</hi> As for their criminal Lording in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> I refer to <hi>Elutherius</hi>'s VINDICATION, (<hi>page</hi> 4, <hi>to</hi> 47.) both for hiſtory &amp; argument.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Conſtruction of that Paſſage, <hi>He that is chief</hi> &amp;c. is againſt the whole Stream of Proteſtant Writers; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly apply this Text in Oppoſition to the uſurped Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of <hi>Rome:</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> do's ſo in particular. But <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Conſtruction of it (<hi>p.</hi> 49.) is fairly reconcilable with <hi>Peter's</hi> Supremacy among the Apoſtles, and makes as much for a <hi>Pope,</hi> as for a <hi>Prelate.</hi> And by his way of arguing in <hi>page</hi> 52d for ought I ſee, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> may <hi>keep his Crown,</hi> as well as any other Prelate his <hi>Mitre,</hi> and <hi>all the Authority ſpiritual and temporal he now enjoys in the World.</hi> If the Biſhops of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> are "<hi>Lords</hi> by the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Courteſy</hi>" (as he obſerves <hi>p.</hi> 53.) I ſubjoyn, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is more than that by the Courteſy of <hi>many</hi> Kings, and once was ſo even of <hi>our own</hi> for many Ages. In which Remarks, <q>

                     <p>It's hardly worth while to make any Obſervations on <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>'s learned Management of the Argument (<hi>page</hi> 50, 51.) where he is <hi>"trying the matter in another Light."</hi> For as to the Doctrine aſſerted by <hi>Elutherius</hi> (Dial. <hi>p.</hi> 38.) <q>That the Chriſtian Church being founded on Chriſt'. <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> there cou'd be no <hi>Miniſters</hi> nor indeed <hi>Members</hi> of this Church, before it had a Being;</q> He has the Happineſs to be able <hi>to</hi> produce good Epiſcopal Authorities for it. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> is fully in the Opinion: See <hi>Irenicum,</hi> p. 210,—218—So Biſhop <hi>Lloyd</hi> (Serm. on <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42.) tells us, <q>That the Diſciples, when Chriſt adminiſtred the Supper to them, were not then in Orders, but were <hi>Laymen;</hi> for (ſays he) it was before our Lord's <hi>Death,</hi> and he did not <hi>ordain</hi> them till after his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
                        </q>—This is enough to ſhew that Elutherius's Doctrine is no peculiar <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Tenet: and therefore whatever Concluſions <hi>Euſebius</hi> pretends to draw from it, they can no more be turn'd to the Prejudice of our Cauſe, than of his own.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have gone thro' the <hi>Dialogue</hi> betwen <hi>Euſebius &amp; Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius;</hi> beſtowing all the Remarks, that cou'd be tho't needful: and muſt ſay upon the whole, I believe, every judicious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd Reader will eaſily concur with me in this Reflection, That <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Conference has very little anſwer'd the <hi>Title</hi> given it; for ELUTHERIUS appears as yet in ſound Health and Vigour, free from all perceivable Symptoms of ENERVATION: and need be in no <hi>Haſte</hi> to fly this redoubted Champion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> XIV. I obſerve, <hi>Philalethes</hi> is ſenſible (by what he ſays in the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> p. 53.) that <hi>Euſebius</hi> had made many <hi>Omiſſions</hi> in his Examination of <hi>Elutherius</hi>'s Dialogue (only <hi>nibbling</hi> at a few Paſſages here and there) and therefore for a further An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to it, refers his Friend <hi>Attalus</hi> to the LETTERS <hi>he had lent him.</hi>—But what need of thoſe Letters to ſatisfy <hi>Attalus,</hi> when <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Arguments in the Conference had ſo ſatisfactorily ſolv'd all his Scruples, and pour'd in upon him ſuch irreſiſtible Conviction; as to engage him inſtantly in the Reſolution of <hi>"returning to his Pariſh-Church"</hi> without any more Adoe, and to tranſport him ſuddenly into the Height of Bigotry!—Truly it looks, I muſt profeſs, very <hi>odd</hi> and ridiculous, to make the Conference ſhut up with ſo ſurprizing an <hi>Epilogue.</hi> Nor wou'd I give a Fig for a Thouſand ſuch
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:003651_0095_10023C9242218840"/>haſty and paſſionate Converts; immediately commencing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Zealots, inſpir'd with the narrow and hot Spirit of a <hi>Party:</hi> altho' <hi>Euſebius</hi> (it ſeems) <q>
                           <hi>thinks his Pains well recompenc'd by this Reſolution of</hi> Attalus, <hi>his old Friend</hi>
                        </q>—Well, I leave 'em now to lay their Heads ſweetly together, and pleaſe themſelves, like true Lovers of Chriſtian Peace and Charity, with railing at Diſſenters, and uniting in the common Cry of the furious Herd, <hi>Better a Papiſt, than a Presbyterian!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I find but one Thing further, that deſerves any Notice; and that is an OBSERVATION <hi>Philalethes</hi> merrily ſuggeſts by way of Banter (<hi>p</hi> 54) which yet ſome may think is in <hi>part</hi> too true to make a Jeſt of. The Gentleman here ſeems indeed to have ſtruck upon one of the cardinal Diſtempers of his Church's Conſtitution; namely, SIMPLE <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ſtript of the uſeful miniſterial Powers of Ordination and Government, to furniſh <hi>dignify'd Officers</hi> with an <hi>overgrown</hi> Power, of little Significance to the main Ends of the Miniſtry, and comparatively <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> as being ſtretcht to an extravagant Extent, "beyond the Sphere of human Activity," and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber'd too with Abundance of civil Avocations. Verily we look on this part of the Conſtitution, SIMPLE <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as exceptionable almoſt as any Thing in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> For, as to <hi>Biſhops,</hi> i. e. ſuch in whom thoſe Powers of ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters, and governing the Church, are united; let us but have <hi>Plenty</hi> enough of 'em (a Biſhop to every Pariſh, if they will) and we are content: Or if they muſt be more <hi>general</hi> Officers, we cou'd yet ſubmit to them upon Occaſion; provided their Epiſcopacy be duly limited, ſo as to be a mere <hi>Preſidency of Order,</hi> and to leave the other Presbyters in full Poſſeſſion of the Powers inherent in their Paſtoral Office.</p>
                     <p>Indeed the <hi>Prelates,</hi> our Adverſaries plead for, are quite of a different Caſt; inviron'd with ſuch peculiar Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as make them obnoxious to great Exceptions: and truly the <hi>whole Model</hi> of their beloved Hierarchy appears to me in ſuch an unproportion'd and disjoynted Condition, as expoſes it to juſt and inſuperable Objections. Suffer me to give you a brief <hi>View</hi> of it, according to the beſt Accounts I can obtain. Without deſcending to every Particularity, take theſe general Hints</p>
                     <p>You muſt obſerve then, in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the DEACONS leaving their proper Work of <hi>ſerving Tables,</hi> do for a ſhort Seaſon officiate as a kind of <hi>Half-Prieſts;</hi> being admitted to <hi>baptize,</hi> as well as <hi>preach,</hi> by the Biſhop's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003651_0095_10023C9242218840"/>but excluded from conſecrating the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> And the PARISH-PRIESTS, are in point of Power and Practice, little more than <hi>Half-Miniſters;</hi> having no Hand in the Buſineſs of <hi>Ordination,</hi> ſubject to the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> of Superiors in matters of <hi>Government,</hi> and debar'd all <hi>publick</hi> and formal Exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Diſcipline.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again obſerve, Here the <hi>Presbyters</hi> are held to be all <hi>Jure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ativo</hi> on a <hi>Level,</hi> in regard of miniſterial Power, as being of one and the ſame Order: yet there are RECTORS, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Pariſhes, that have other Presbyters in <hi>Subordination to</hi> them, as their <hi>Curates</hi> or Deputies, who are <hi>de facto</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul'd by their Maſters at pleaſure, and allow'd to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Importance without their Leave. And there are ARCH-DEACONS, ſo called, tho' not of the Order of Deacons, but <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who hold their <hi>Courts,</hi> and are Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents over the inferior Clergy in their reſpective Diſtricts.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve again, Here the <hi>Biſhops</hi> are aſſerted to be all of one Order and equal Authority; yet <hi>Two</hi> of theſe, poſſeſſing <hi>Metropolitan</hi> Sees, are named ARCH-BISHOPS, and the reſt of the Prelates at their Conſecration take a ſolemn OATH OF DUE OBEDIENCE to them, in their reſpective Provinces. One is <hi>Primate of England;</hi> the other of <hi>all England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, here <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are doctrinally held to be two <hi>different</hi> Orders: and yet are practically <hi>blended</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ſeveral Reſpects. For in the Church of <hi>England</hi> there are <hi>Presbyters</hi> having Government over Presbyters; as in the Caſe of the <hi>Cathedral</hi> DEAN who claims and exerciſes Juriſdictions, in certain Points, uncontroulable by the <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and in the Caſe of <hi>Arch-Deacons,</hi> "who act (ſo Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> obſerves) as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> without Controul." Yet neither of theſe is of the <hi>Order,</hi> to which <hi>that kind</hi> of Government (I mean the Government of the <hi>Clergy</hi>) is pretended to be appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. — I omit ſubordinate <hi>Officials, Commiſſaries,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Yea, here are Some of the very LAITY exerciſing <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Powers over the inferior <hi>ſacred Orders;</hi> and even the <hi>Rectors</hi> of Pariſhes, tho' claiming ſomething of <hi>Paſtoral</hi> Authority, muſt with an implicit Faith obey the ſpiritual <hi>Courts,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of thoſe irregular Eccleſiaſticks: who were never heard of in <hi>Antiquity,</hi> about which our Adverſaries ſo loudly din us in the Ear continually, but are of <hi>novel</hi> Invention.</p>
                     <p>Here the BISHOPS have the Honour to be <hi>temporal Princes,</hi> Members of the Houſe of <hi>Lords;</hi> but are ſcarce any better than mere <hi>titular</hi> Adminiſtrators of Church-Diſcipline: tho'
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:003651_0096_10023C7D72962A30"/>pretended to be <hi>ſole Paſtors</hi> of large Dioceſſes, at leaſt the <hi>chief Governors;</hi> yet ſeem really to ſtand for little more than <hi>Cyphers,</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts.— Here are CHANCEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LORS, mercinary <hi>Laymen,</hi> yet <hi>ſpiritual Lords;</hi> having in fact the Power of Excommunication, and Abſolution (two of the moſt important Branches of Eccleſiaſtical Judgment) lodged in their hands; excluſive of the <hi>Parochial</hi> Clergy, and (as it ſeems) unaccountable to their <hi>Dioceſans:</hi> and the Forms of Proceeding in their Courts are ſuch (ſo Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> complains) as have in a great meaſure enervated all Church-Diſcipline. And further here are EXEMPT <hi>Presbyters,</hi> in the Quality of <hi>Deans,</hi> practiſing <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Authority (tho' in Contradiction to their Principle, ſays Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>) independent on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, in the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, the KING is according to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution the ſole Fountain of all Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical: and <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Archdeacons, and other eccleſiaſtical Perſons, have</hi> NO MANNER <hi>of Juriſdiction, but</hi> BY <hi>and under the King</hi>'s <hi>Majeſty;</hi> who is ſupreme Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in Contradiſtinction to the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is final Judge of Controverſies <hi>in all Things and Cauſes ſpiritual.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is a ſummary, and I think true State of Matters of Fact in the eſtabliſh'd <hi>National</hi> Church.

I cou'd not help admiring at the Conduct of <hi>Philalethes,</hi> in palming them on the World, as "<hi>written by a</hi> LAYMAN": Unleſs by a Figure, he intended to transfer this Character to <hi>a dear Friend of his,</hi> who doubtleſs was mightily pleas'd with that ſhrewd OBSERVATION in the Cloſe of the <hi>Dialogue</hi> (offer'd as a Conſequence upon <hi>Elutherius</hi>'s Argument) That the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church muſt be <hi>mere human Creatures,</hi> if their <hi>Biſhops</hi> at beſt be but ſuch. (<hi>p.</hi> 54) — I take Occaſion to ſay here, That <hi>his Flirt</hi> at the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> (as I take it) in the following Words, <q>
                           <hi>Since all their Power is derived from ſuch Creatures, it muſt be merely human ſtill, and not of Chriſt's appointing;</hi>
                        </q> This, I ſay, being but obſcure as to the Reference, and not expreſly level'd at <hi>us,</hi> it eſcap'd my Notice at firſt; and I now forgive it, ſince he makes ſo light of a <hi>Lay</hi>-Character, and appears ſo willing to ſhare with us in the <hi>Odium</hi> of a Lay-Derivation.</p>
                     <p>I find little of ſolid Argument, in theſe Letters, that's new, and not already obviated in the foregoing Papers. However, that my Rev. Brother <hi>Layman</hi> may have no Colour for Complaint of being treated as <hi>"too contemptible a Perſon to be our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in this Controverſy,"</hi> I will conſider the principal Contents of his Letters; which being made publick without any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Direction, every one may claim a Right to make what Return he thinks fit unto them.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Letter, we perceive, had an <hi>Anſwer</hi> made unto it by the Gentleman it was ſent to in <hi>Manuſcript;</hi> which, I'm humbly of Opinion, it wou'd have been but a piece of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:003651_0097_10023C7FCD9CAA38"/>common Juſtice in Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> to have publiſh'd at the ſame time, or elſe to have ſuppreſs'd his <hi>ſecond</hi> Letter, in Reply thereto. Nevertheleſs, we will follow him in his own Path, and e'en take Things as we find them.</p>

                        </q> To prevent this, he lays down <hi>two Rules</hi> for the <hi>right interpreting</hi> of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>His <hi>firſt</hi> Rule, i. e. <hi>"Comparing one Paſſage with another"</hi> &amp;c. is not only a very <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> one (as he ſays) but the moſt effectual and ſatisfactory. This is the Rule with all true <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> by this Method the Reformers confounded the Papiſts, and in this Way the primitive Fathers were wont to confute Hereticks. And if in this way the Cauſe of the <hi>New England</hi> Churches cannot be ſupported, we are willing to loſe it. Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> quotes <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſaying, <q>

                        </q> I have ſaid ſomething to this before: But now let Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſpeak. (See his Book, <hi>p.</hi> 137.) <q>Who can doubt but the <hi>primitive</hi> Chriſtians, to whom the Epiſtles of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were written, either of themſelves underſtood, or were inſtructed by the Apoſtles touching the Senſe of the <hi>obſcure</hi> places of them? Theſe TRADITIVE <hi>Interpretations,</hi> had they been <hi>written</hi> and <hi>diſperſed,</hi> as the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were, had without queſtion been <hi>preſerved,</hi> as the Scriptures are: But to ſhew how excellent a KEEPER of the <hi>Tradition,</hi> the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been, or even the CATHOLICK <hi>Church,</hi> for want of writing <hi>They are</hi> ALL LOST, nay, were loſt within a <hi>few</hi> Ages after Chriſt: So that if we conſult the ANCIENT <hi>Interpreters</hi> [N.

                        </q> —May we venture to take Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Word in this Caſe? If ſo, this at once deſtroys the Credit of Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s SAFE WITNESSES and BEST GUIDES. And pray, <hi>who</hi> is't now that reflects on the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the <hi>good old Fathers,</hi> as if there were <hi>no Faith in what they ſay!</hi> Where's the <hi>glorious</hi> UNITY, Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> boaſts of, among the primitive Fathers; and on which <hi>the Authority of thoſe venerable Martyrs and Confeſſors</hi> ſo depends! You ſee, they are not only <hi>"ſome of our Perſuaſion"</hi> (as he inſinuates, <hi>p.</hi> 72.) that undervalue the Authority of ancient Interpretations and Traditions.

"The Error of the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> continued THREE HUNDRED Years;</q> that is, ſucceſſively from the time of <hi>Papias,</hi> who was contemporary with the Apoſtle <hi>John.</hi> (<hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 324.)—So Archbiſhop TILLOTSON (Fol.

                        </q> Well, to this the Anſwer is ſtill <hi>affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> The Mouth of <hi>two Witneſſes</hi> may ſuffice, for Evidence, both of which liv'd in the next Age after the Apoſtles. I ſhall take my Account from Mr. CHILLINGWORTH. (<hi>Relig. Prot.</hi> p. 309.) <q>It appears manifeſtly out of this Book of IRENAEUS (Lib. 3. <hi>adv Haer.</hi>) that the Doctrine of the <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> was in <hi>his</hi> Judgment <hi>Apoſtolique</hi> Tradition, <hi>as alſo</hi> it was <hi>eſteemed</hi> (for ought appears to the Contrary) by ALL the <hi>Doctors,</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> of or about <hi>his</hi> Time; for ALL that ſpake of it, or whoſe Judgments in the point are any way recorded, are <hi>for</hi> it: and JUSTIN MARTYR (In Dial. cum <hi>Tryphon.</hi>) profeſſeth, that ALL <hi>good and orthodox Chriſtians of his Time believed it;</hi> and thoſe that did not, he reckons among <hi>Heretiques.</hi>
                        </q> Will any one now deny, the Doctrine was <hi>univerſal!</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> has another Queſtion behind; <hi>Did any of the Fathers plead for the</hi> Chiliaſt <hi>Notion as an</hi> ESSENTIAL <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſtianity?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Judge you</hi> by the Account of <hi>Juſtin</hi> above given: He manifeſtly eſteem'd it a Doctrine of ſuch Importance, That <hi>thoſe who did not believe it, he reckon'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong</hi> HERETICKS. I ſhall add, in the Words of <hi>A. Bp.</hi> TIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOTSON (<hi>Vol.</hi> 1. p. 732.) <q>It is not material to my Purpoſe, whether or no <hi>Juſtin</hi> look'd upon this as a Point <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Salvation, ſo long as it is evident that he looked upon it
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:003651_0107_10023CD3F5E8ACA8"/>as a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and Part of the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine.</hi> And yet, it ſeems, he thought it a Point of <hi>more than ordinary</hi> Importance, becauſe he joyns it with the Doctrine of the RESURRECTION, and ſays that it was <hi>not diſowned by any but thoſe who alſo denied the Reſurrection.</hi>
                        </q> He expreſly ſays of the Diſowners of this Doctrine, <q>Of <hi>theſe</hi> who are called indeed Chriſtians, but are <hi>atheiſtical</hi> and <hi>impious Hereticks,</hi> I have ſhewed, that they teach in all Points blaſphemous, atheiſtical and abſurd Things &amp;c.

                     <p>Thus it appears, the Doctrine of the <hi>Millennium</hi> was in <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s time <hi>Univerſally</hi> believ'd by the Orthodox, and held to be <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> and ſuch as deny'd it deem'd <hi>Heretical.</hi> Upon the whole take this Obſervation, in the <hi>Archbiſhop's</hi> Words (<hi>p.</hi> 730.) <q>If notwithſtanding the <hi>Perſuaſion</hi> of <hi>that Age,</hi> that this Doctrine was deſcended to them from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> it was <hi>not</hi> really ſo deſcended; Then the <hi>Perſuaſion</hi> of Chriſtians in <hi>any</hi> Age, that a Doctrine was brought down to them from the Apoſtles, is no <hi>Demonſtration</hi> that it was ſo. —The natural <hi>Conſequence</hi> (of the <hi>Premiſes</hi>) is this (ſays he) That the Miſtake of ONE <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>credulous</hi> Man may in an Age or two give Occaſion to the <hi>univerſal</hi> Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of a Doctrine, <hi>as</hi> deſcended down to them from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when there was <hi>no ſuch Matter.</hi>

                        </q> I add, WHEN in the Caſe of the <hi>Chiliaſt</hi>-Notion, there was the faireſt Appearance of an <hi>authentick</hi> Tradition from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſome Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> ſeeming to <hi>favour</hi> the Opinion, a very <hi>early</hi> Entertainment of it, an <hi>univerſal</hi> Suffrage for it, and a <hi>long</hi> Duration thereof thro' the Courſe of Three Centuries (all which <hi>flagrantly appears matter of fact</hi>) yet all this while, if we may believe the Church in Ages following (for at preſent I am not concern'd to deliver my own private Thoughts on the Subject) the <hi>Millenary</hi> Opinion was <hi>erroneous,</hi> and the Tradition has been almoſt as univerſally condemn'd for <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> as once it was receiv'd for <hi>Canonical.</hi> Now, why may not we ſuppoſe, the Tradition pleaded in behalf of the diſtinct Order and the Divine Right of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> has as little of Truth in its Foundation? <q>This Notion being once ſtarted (as Dr. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy</hi> obſerves, <hi>Mod Non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:003651_0108_10023D13F6709988"/>Canon of Scripture, and this alone excepted, without a Rival. The famous Mr. CHILLINGWORTH (<hi>p.</hi> 102.) has theſe words; <q>The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Writings are the <hi>only</hi> Rule for us to judge <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies</hi> by; There being NOTHING <hi>unwritten,</hi> which can go in upon <hi>half ſo fair Cards,</hi> for the Title of <hi>Apoſtolike</hi> Tradition, as theſe Things, which by the Confeſſion of both ſides are <hi>not</hi> ſo: I mean <hi>the Doctrine of the</hi> MILLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARIES, and <hi>of the Neceſſity of the Euchariſt for Infants.</hi>
                        </q> Again, hear what he ſays (<hi>p.</hi> 136.) <q>To deal ingenuouſly with You and the World, I am not ſuch an Idolater of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as to think all his Sentences are Oracles; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this thing, that whatſoever was practiſed or held by the <hi>univerſal</hi> Church of <hi>his</hi> Time, muſt needs have come from the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Though, conſidering the <hi>Nearneſs</hi> of his Time to the Apoſtles, I think it a good probable Way, and therefore am apt enough to follow it, when I ſee no Reaſon to the contrary. Yet, I profeſs, I muſt have better Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, before I can induce my ſelf to hold it <hi>certain;</hi>— becauſe by the Church <hi>univerſal</hi> of ſome Time, and the Church <hi>univerſal</hi> of other Times, I ſee plain <hi>Contradictions</hi> held and practiſed: Both which could not come from the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> for then the Apoſtles had been Teachers of <hi>Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>—I inſtance in the Doctrine of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the Euchariſt's Neceſſity for <hi>Infants:</hi> both which Doctrines have been taught by the CONSENT of the eminent <hi>Fathers</hi> of ſome Ages, without any <hi>Oppoſition</hi> from any of their Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries; and were delivered by them, not as <hi>Doctors,</hi> but as WITNESSES, not as their own Opinions, but as APOSTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LICK <hi>Traditions:</hi> — And <hi>(yet)</hi> that the contrary Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines were <hi>Catholique</hi> at ſome other Time, I believe you will not think it needful for me to prove.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So again (<hi>p.</hi> 261.) <q>Though ſome Proteſtants confeſs ſome of your Doctrine is <hi>Ancient:</hi> yet this is <hi>Nothing,</hi> ſo long as it is evident, even by the Confeſſion of all Sides, that <hi>many Errors,</hi> I inſtance in that of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of <hi>Infants,</hi> were more ancient.

                     <p>This now, I think, ſubverts the Foundation of Mr. <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Argument from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Epiſcopacy:</hi> and particularly invalidates the Argument <hi>a Minori,</hi> which he ſo inſiſts upon in both Letters; I mean, his Objection from

                           <hi>the Teſtimonies of the primitive Church in thoſe Caſes are not ſo ancient, clear and frequent, as for interpreting of Scripture in favour of Epiſcopacy.</hi>" Particularly he ſays (<hi>p</hi> 69.) "<hi>We have much more ancient, clear and frequent Teſtimonies, in favour of Epiſcopacy, than can be produced in the Cauſe of</hi> Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: <hi>For there is no Father</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that gives a full clear and inconteſtible Teſtimony for</hi> Infant Baptiſme, <hi>before St.</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, <hi>who lived</hi> 150 <hi>Years after the Apoſtles</hi>

Whereas now the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaſm</hi> of the Ancients has a known fix'd and unvarying Idea; So that here the Fathers Teſtimonies are in a <hi>plain</hi> Caſe: which Conſideration muſt neceſſarily caſt the Balance in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>my</hi> Point, and give a greater Weight and Force to Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Argument as I apply it, than as he uſes it. The confeſſed Ambiguity of the word <hi>Biſhop,</hi> makes his Argument againſt me poſſibly a mere <hi>Fallacy:</hi> Nevertheleſs the ſame Argument, as I uſe it againſt him, he muſt grant to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Demonſtration;</hi> being in a Caſe where there's no ſuch Ambiguity acknowleg'd.

                     <p>After all, it may be, our <hi>Lay-Adverſary</hi> will tell me, I have been arguing only in the <hi>Evaſive</hi> Way, and that he expected I wou'd ſpeak more directly to the Point, in refuting his grand Charge againſt us, as <hi>joyning with</hi> DEISTS <hi>and</hi> INFI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DELS, <hi>deſtroying all hiſtorical Faith, and ſhocking even the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themſelves,</hi> while we reject the Teſtimony of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in favour of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which (as he ſays) hath as good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from human Teſtimony, as the CANON OF SCRIPTURE.

                     <p>I obſerve, firſt, The Gentleman argues upon an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> which he knows we cannot grant him; That the primitive <hi>Fathers</hi> do, in fact, bear their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> in his Acceptation of it. We don't deny (as we judge) the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Epiſcopacy; but only that of the modern Stamp, which we think a Stranger to the beſt and pureſt Antiquity. Here then Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> is guilty of the Sophiſm, call'd <hi>Petitio Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipii.</hi> He charges us as being in a Confederacy with <hi>Deiſts</hi> (to bring the Scriptures into Diſgrace, which have no other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Evidence (ſays he) but the Teſtimony of the Fathers) <hi>Becauſe</hi> we reject the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> which the Fathers bear to <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan</hi> Epiſcopacy: Whereas it is one great Point in Conteſt, whether the Fathers <hi>do</hi> give their Atteſtation to <hi>this Species</hi> of Epiſcopacy. We diſpute it: but do's our rejecting <hi>his</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Fathers, prove our <hi>treating them with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt!</hi> It's true, we cannot but have a hearty Contempt for the <hi>Pretended</hi> Teſtimonies from the Fathers, alledg'd in the Cauſe of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, as wholly <hi>impertinent:</hi> and yet at the ſame time we may highly honour their <hi>Real</hi> Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to the Canon of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But then, admitting the Fathers probably ſpeak of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Acceptation of it, will he (dare he!) pretend,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:003651_0111_10023CF88F76FC00"/>that the Teſtimonies in that Caſe are as <hi>full</hi> and <hi>unanimous, clear</hi> and <hi>ſtrong,</hi> as for the Canon of Scripture? Is the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficiently teſtify'd to be univerſal, original and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted, in one Caſe, as well as the other? If not, 'tis no criminal Partiality, nor any Contempt of the Fathers, to reject a <hi>defective</hi> Teſtimony, while we accept their fuller and clearer Suffrage in another Caſe.</p>
                     <p>But then again, ſuppoſing that the <hi>Fathers</hi> had given the <hi>fulleſt</hi> and <hi>plaineſt</hi> Teſtimonies to Epiſcopacy, as to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Without which, I doubt, our Author's Cauſe will finally miſcarry, and his Argument ſignify juſt nothing. According to the common Doctrine of our Adverſaries, all that are not in the true <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

How eaſy a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were it, for particular Churches to be impos'd upon with forged Orders, or uncanonical Conſecrations; whereby the Line would certainly be violated! But how impoſſible were it, to obtrude a falſe Bible on the whole Church of God! And when ſome have attempted to forge Books of Scripture and father 'em on ſome Apoſtle, how eaſily has the Cheat been detected! Now, that in Fact there have been repeated Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of regular Succeſſion, ſeems to be paſt all Controverſy. Biſhop HOADLY (<hi>Preſerv.</hi> p. 78.) obſerves; <q>This <hi>regular uninterrupted Succeſſion</hi> of Perſons qualified and regularly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, is a matter <hi>impoſſible</hi> to be proved: Nay, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> is more than probable, upon all <hi>hiſtorical Evidence.</hi>
                        </q> But that we have the true Canon of Scripture, I hope, Mr <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> will allow to be capable of Demonſtration by the beſt hiſtorical and rational Evidence A Succeſſion of true Bibles is a thouſand times more evident, than a Succeſſion of true Biſhops.

<pb n="87" facs="unknown:003651_0111_10023CF88F76FC00"/>of <hi>Innovations</hi> in the primitive Church, or at leaſt a Certainty of their Freedom from <hi>Changes</hi> and <hi>Corruptions,</hi> which is contrary to all Accounts of thoſe Times, and will appear highly improbable, if we reflect on the uſual Tempers and Prope<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſions of Mankind. But then it will be ſaid, The Fathers teſtify to the <hi>Right,</hi> as well as Fact. I reply, This is as eaſily deny'd, as affirm'd; and we think, no ſufficient Proof has yet appear'd. However, upon Suppoſition of Proof, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>l it remains a Doubt, whether mere human Teſtimony to the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy is ſufficient to bind it on the Conſcience, as a matter of Neceſſity to be believ'd &amp; practis'd. The <hi>Divine Right</hi> can be infer'd only from <hi>Scripture:</hi> if it be not <hi>evident</hi> from thence, it can never be made evident. And if the Divine Inſtitution of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> muſt be fetcht from Scripture, then it will be neceſſary, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, to prove the Apoſtolick Original of the <hi>Scriptures:</hi> without which it will be intirely out of our Power to prove the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Epiſcopacy. But then, when we are ſatiſfy'd of the Truth in this great Point, it follows in the Nature and Reaſon of Things, that we muſt now take the <hi>Divine Book</hi> for our <hi>only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </hi> of Faith. The univerſal uncontroul'd Tradition, in the Caſe of the ſacred Canon, carries a rational Probability, that may juſtly beget in us an Eſteem for the Bible, and put us upon examining its Contents: and when by viewing the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Evidences of its Divine Original, we become ſo ſatisfy'd of that, as to take it for the Word of God; we are now of Conſequence to judge and try all other <hi>Traditions,</hi> of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reference, <hi>by this Rule,</hi> and not the Rule <hi>by them.</hi> And we muſt ſay, when we judge of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Tradition, by the Rule of <hi>Scripture,</hi> we can diſcern no evident <hi>Characters of Divinity</hi> upon it, to indicate an <hi>Apoſtolick Original;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but vote the Pretence of Divine Right, a mere Impoſture.</p>
                     <p>In fine, allowing the Divine Right of Biſhops to be held by ſome of the Fathers, yet (to return Mr <hi>Layman</hi> a Queſtion or two of his own) "<hi>Do any of them aſſert this to be the</hi> UNIVERSAL <hi>Doctrine of the Church in thoſe Days? Or do they plead for it as an</hi> ESSENTIAL <hi>Doctrine of Chriſtianity?</hi> Perhaps I may ſafely anſwer (as he in another Caſe) NO, <hi>not a word of this.</hi> Whereas now, the Divine Right and the uninterrupted Succeſſion of Epiſcopacy are <hi>fundamental</hi> Points with Men of Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Principles: who tell us, that ſuch as are not in profeſſed Unity and Communion with <hi>their Church,</hi> govern'd by

                        <hi>Biſhops</hi> in a regular <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> are out of Chriſt's <hi>Church</hi> and out of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> out of the <hi>Favour</hi> of God, and out of the Way to <hi>Salvation.</hi> Herein, I think, they tour very high above all the ſoaring Strains of the moſt hyperbolical Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Antiquity: or at leaſt they can't produce the <hi>univerſal Suffrage</hi> of the primitive Fathers, to confirm theſe wild and rampant Imaginations. Sad wou'd it be for us, if the Truth of Chriſtianity had no better Evidence, than the Truth of this ſtrange Doctrine. Will Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> pretend, that the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ancient Doctors and Confeſſors, who ſeal'd with their Blood a Teſtimony to the Goſpel of Chriſt, have left their Teſtimony to this <hi>high Rant</hi> in favour of Epiſcopacy! I dare ſay, tho' we deſpiſe this from our hearts, yet we don't herein reject the <hi>unanimous Suffrage</hi> of the primitive Church. Should it appear, that one or two Fathers have aſſerted the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, as an Eſſential Doctrine of Chriſtianity, let this be thrown into the Liſt of "<hi>their</hi> NOSTRUMS, or <hi>private Opinions,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Layman (p.</hi> 83.) obſerves, <hi>They might have, as well as other Men:</hi>" and in which I hope, we may ſafely venture to differ from them. I truſt, we are as <hi>ſtrictly tenacious,</hi> as Mr. Layman, <hi>of all thoſe great Truths, which all Chriſtendom in thoſe days agreed upon to be the Eſſentials of Religion:</hi> But then, when he ranks <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> among theſe <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> we think he departs from the current Senſe of Antiquity; and that this <hi>favorite Tenet</hi> of his is far from being one of thoſe Points, which <hi>all Chriſtendom</hi> in thoſe days <hi>agreed</hi> upon. For ought I ſee then we may renounce Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s ESSENTIAL Doctrine; and yet retain a ſufficient Reſpect for the primitive Church, and <hi>pay a</hi> juſt <hi>Deference to the univerſal Suffrage of thoſe venerable Martyrs and Confeſſors, who are Witneſſes to the Divine Original of the holy Oracles.</hi> It is therefore an intolerable Inſult, and abuſive Sophiſtry in this Gentleman, to repreſent us (firſt) as <hi>treating the primitive Fathers with Contempt,</hi> merely becauſe we ſlight his pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Teſtimonies from Antiquity in relation to Dioceſan <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy:</hi> and (then) as <hi>joyning with</hi> DEISTS and ATHEISTS, in undermining Chriſtianity; becauſe there is <hi>no external Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Canon of the ſeveral Books of Scripture, that he knows of, beſides the Teſtimony of thoſe good Men, whom</hi> (as he will have it) <hi>we treat with ſo much Contempt.</hi> This is the mighty Argument, he urges in Support of his Charge: but there's as little Reaſon in his Plea, as of Charity in his Accuſation. It ſeems to me, there's Abundance of Fallacy in this way of arguing.</p>

For if not, why does he make ſuch a Stir with his <hi>external Evidence of the Canon of the ſeveral Books!</hi> Again, I have to inquire of him, how far he thinks the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the primitive Fathers may ſerve as an <hi>external Evidence</hi> to ſatisfy <hi>us,</hi> that we have pure and genuine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the true and intire Canon, without Mutilation, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? And how he'll make it appear, that their Teſtimony is the <hi>only</hi> external Evidence? Or if ſo, whether this external Evidence is <hi>abſolutely neceſſary,</hi> that no other kind of Evidence will ſuffice without this?

Nevertheleſs, the Queſtion riſes, Whether the Fathers held their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in the <hi>new</hi> Senſe of the Word, to be of <hi>Divine Right?</hi> Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> I doubt not, will be of Opinion, They did ſo. But then unhappily for him it falls out, ſince Words may <hi>vary</hi> their Senſe in different Ages, we are conſequently left at an <hi>Uncertainty</hi> what they meant by a <hi>Divine Right.</hi> Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> I ſuppoſe, will underſtand by it a Right of <hi>Duty</hi> or Obligation, by virtue of a poſitive <hi>Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Chriſt: But the <hi>Fathers</hi> might mean by it only a Right of lawful <hi>Liberty,</hi> by virtue of the Divine <hi>Permiſſion</hi> (they apprehending no expreſs Prohibition in the Caſe) and by virtue of the generall Rules of purſuing <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> to which Ends they might think their invented <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> a Means adapted: and it's well known, they were wont to ſtamp any thing with the Names of <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> that they thought had a Tendency to thoſe excellent Ends. So that theſe Phraſes, <hi>Divine Right</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolical Tradition,</hi> as uſed by the Fathers, do manifeſtly carry as much <hi>Ambiguity</hi> with them, as the word <hi>Biſhop</hi> in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>And then another Difficulty is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>what</hi> was the <hi>new Senſe,</hi> in which the Fathers apply'd the Word <hi>Biſhop,</hi> after the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating of the Name to ſome ſpecial Perſons in the Miniſtry; whether it denoted at firſt a different <hi>Order,</hi> or only a different <hi>Degree</hi> in the ſame Order; whether it denoted a <hi>Superiority of Power</hi> over the Presbyters, and an Excluſion of them from the Government of the Church, or only a mere <hi>Preſidency,</hi> a
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:003651_0116_10023CF061AF94B8"/>Priority of one for Order's ſake above the reſt, ſtill preſerving an Equality of Power. I think the latter is more probably the true State of the Caſe. But Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> looking thro' the falſe Proſpective of modern Uſage, thinks the Name <hi>Biſhop</hi> meant the ſame Thing in the primitive Church, as now in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Juſt as the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whenever the Word <hi>Miſſa</hi> occurs in ancient Fathers, preſently imagine it intends the ſame Thing, as it now thro' Cuſtom ſignifies, ſince it has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to that which they call the <hi>Sacrifice of the Altar.</hi>

                        </q> This Poſtulatum is founded on ſeveral <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> either of which will bear a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; and therefore muſt not paſs for a ſelf-evident Propoſition.</p>

Whereas in the Caſe of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> there was a mutual Interchange: the Application of the Names was <hi>reciprocal.</hi> This makes a vaſt Difference, and I think quite deſtroys Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Argument</p>

                        </hi> CHURCH, it's a Queſtion that enters into the Heart of the Controverſy, <hi>What</hi> CHURCH <hi>is here to be underſtood?</hi> Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> knows, this Word has various Significations, and is of as uncertain a Sound, as the Word <hi>Biſhop.</hi> I inquire then, what Notion he has of the primitive Churches, in each of which he ſays the Apoſtles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Preſident <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Were they of the <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> or the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial</hi> Form?

Now I deſire the favour of Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> to ſay <hi>which</hi> of theſe different <hi>Species,</hi> he intended in the Queſtion before us: or if neither, then to give a <hi>Third.</hi> If he ſpeaks of the <hi>Parochial</hi> Church, we ſhall not be fond of contending with him; provided he do's not make it <hi>eſſential</hi> to a Church, to have ſubordinate Presbyters in it. But if he ſpeaks of a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church, I deſire to be reſolv'd in theſe Inquiries, Whether it was <hi>limited</hi> originally by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>City;</hi> or took a wider Compaſs, and extended to a <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of Cities and Towns, according to the Model of theſe Times?

                     <p>An other Expreſſion I muſt remark upon, is that, wherein he <hi>characterizes</hi> the <hi>Officer,</hi> in Queſtion: <q>
                           <hi>Whether the Apoſtles did not appoint in each Church a</hi> PRESIDENT, <hi>or</hi> GOVERNOR <hi>ſuperior to, and with</hi> JURISDICTION <hi>over the Presbyters</hi> &amp;c.</q> The word <hi>Preſident</hi> is equivocal, ſerving for very different Notions; and tho', for any thing in the Notation of the Word, it may have the ſame Idea with the Term <hi>Governor,</hi> yet in modern Uſe it ſignifies only a <hi>chief Manager</hi> or <hi>Director,</hi> as the <hi>Preſident</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Council,</hi> whoſe Office is to propoſe Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the Council-Table, &amp; report — Now had Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> uſed but this ſingle Term, I ſhould have thought he meant nothing more than a <hi>Moderator</hi> in the Council of Presbyters:
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:003651_0119_10023D199EC1C398"/>And indeed he tells us (<hi>p.</hi> 101.) <q>
                           <hi>That this is</hi> ALL <hi>he contends for,</hi> in behalf of Biſhops, <hi>ſuppoſing them fixed in that Office, and no publick Acts of Government be done by the Presbytery without them at the head of Affairs.</hi>
                        </q> But this ſeems to me, to appear all <hi>Jeſt,</hi> when I conſider what follows in the Queſtion, by way of Explanation; — "<hi>a Preſident, or</hi> GOVERNOR (ſays he) <hi>ſuperiour to, and having</hi> JURISDICTION, <hi>over the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>" &amp;c.

                        </gap> amuze us, when he ſays, a <hi>Moderator</hi> is all he contends for. The Gentleman appears plainly to contend for a <hi>Governor</hi> with <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over Presbyters. The word <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> ſounds high; it may comprehend all Acts of Government, <hi>Legiſlative, Judicial,</hi> and <hi>Executive:</hi> I know not whether he meant all; or if not all, which did he mean?

                     <p>In fine, I obſerve, Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> in the Queſtion having men<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion'd the <hi>Presbyters or Biſhops and Deacons,</hi> brings in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Have the <hi>Pariſh-Prieſts</hi> in the Church of <hi>England</hi> the Government of the People, the Power of the <hi>Church-Keys,</hi> in the full Degree, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> left it to the Presbyters of particular Churches?

                        </q> And yet almoſt in the ſame breath (<hi>p.</hi> 101.) he ſays, <q>

<pb n="104" facs="unknown:003651_0120_10023D1CA4566610"/>in Terms: I ſhall wiſh to ſee how the Gentleman will recon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cile theſe two Paſſages, in appearance ſo inconſiſtent. Ti then we can't poſſibly underſtand what it is he contends for and his <hi>Queſtion thus ſtated</hi> leaves us as much in the Dark as ever. I muſt beg him to define what the <hi>Power</hi> of his PRESBYTERS or <hi>Biſhops</hi> is in their reſpective Churches, or how the People are <hi>under them:</hi> whether in any other Senſe than as they are <hi>under the</hi> DEACONS. And I muſt intreat him more clearly to define the Power of his <hi>Preſident</hi> or <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> and tell us what is that <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over the Biſhops and Deacons, which he attributes to the ſaid Officer.</p>
                     <p>But after all this, perhaps we've been talking only of a mere <hi>Phantaſm;</hi> a <hi>Preſident</hi> that exiſts but in Imagination: for we muſt obſerve, in <hi>England</hi> it is not one <hi>Prelate,</hi> but one <hi>Lay-man,</hi> a <hi>Chancellor</hi> that is eminently this <hi>Preſident,</hi> who has in his hand the Power of the Keys, and manages the Buſineſs of Court-trials; the <hi>Prelate</hi> ſeldom or not at all medling with it, and the <hi>Parochial</hi> Biſhops intirely excluded from it, being but as <hi>Criers</hi> to publiſh the Sentences of the <hi>Lay-Chancellor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And truly I muſt obſerve, the Gentleman leaves us at a loſs, whether by his <hi>Preſident</hi> or Governor over the Presbyters, he does not actually mean this <hi>Lay-Chancellor:</hi> for in his Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he omits telling us, whether the Officer appointed by the Apoſtles to exerciſe Juriſdiction over the Presbyters, was one ſo much as in <hi>ſacred Orders.</hi> But if it ſeem too captions, to except at his Definition on this Account, and tho' we ſhould ſuppoſe he meant ſuch a Preſident as is in Orders; yet there's another Exception, which I can't ſee how he will avoid the force of: and this is, That he has left us at Uncertainty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Preſident</hi> muſt be of a ſuperior <hi>Order</hi> to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and may not be an Officer in the Nature of an <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,</hi> of the ſame Order with the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Biſhops,</hi> tho' above them in <hi>Degree:</hi> for I hope the Gentleman will allow an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> in the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be "<hi>a Preſident or Governor ſuperior to and with Juriſdiction</hi> (in ſome Senſe) <hi>over the Presbyters or Biſhops,</hi>" ſince he has ſo many tranſcendent <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> and the <hi>Prelates</hi> are oblig'd at their Conſecration to take an <hi>Oath of due</hi> OBEDIENCE <hi>to him.</hi> Or perhaps Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Preſident may be the <hi>Archdeacon</hi> (an acknowledg'd mere Presbyter) or the <hi>Dean</hi> (ſtill a Presbyter;) either of which (and the latter eſpecially, in the <hi>Peculiars</hi>) is an Officer to whom his Deſcription, ſaid down in the Queſtion, agrees ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly;

                     <p>Thus the Gentleman has put us to ſome Trouble, by his floating ſo in Ambiguities, to ſearch out his Meaning. And now if I have been ſo happy as to hit upon his true Meaning, in either of the Inſtances above, I muſt deſire to be inform'd how it appears, that <hi>the Apoſtles did appoint in each Church,</hi> ſuch <hi>a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident or Governor,</hi> whether Chancellor, Dean, Arch-deacon, or Arch-biſhop. Was this the <hi>State of Things, while the Church was yet in her Embryo &amp; firſt Rudiments?</hi> Or did Things arrive to this Paſs <hi>afterwards, when the State of the Church became more ripe and ſettled?</hi> Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> pretends (p. 61.) to <q>
                           <hi>confine himſelf,</hi> in his Inquiries, <hi>to what Intimations we have of the Conſtitution of thoſe Churches, which were grown into Form, and ſeem to have been ſettled in Scripture-times.</hi>

                        </q> Hence then we muſt conclude, if Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> has prov'd any thing, he has prov'd the Divine Right of <hi>Archbiſhops, Arch-deacons, Deans,</hi> and <hi>Lay-Chancellors,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Apoſtles, when the Churches were bro't into Form, <hi>Preſidents or Governors over the Presbyters;</hi> for ſuch they are according to the preſent Model of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and do as Governors enter as much into the Eſſence of the Conſtitution, for ought I ſee, as the <hi>Dioceſan Prelates.</hi> For which Reaſon, if it ſhould be reply'd by Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> that he pretends not to prove the Divine Inſtitution of <hi>Chancellors, Deans,</hi> &amp;c.

                           <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> as <hi>a wiſe Appointment of the Apoſtles under the Guidance of the Holy Ghoſt, being in the nature of the Thing</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the moſt likely Form of Government, to prevent Diviſions and Diſorders:</hi>

                        </q> which the Chriſtian World has often groaned under. Happy were it for Chriſtendom, if all Papal Tyrants and Proteſtant Uſurpers in the Churches every where had their extended Territories crumbled into juſt Diviſions, and Epiſcopacy were reduc'd within the ancient modeſt Bounds of a <hi>Town</hi> or City at moſt.

                     <p n="3">3. Our Author (<hi>p</hi> 63.) ſays, <q>
                           <hi>The Churches were at firſt taken Care of by Presbyters, ſtill under the Government of the Apoſtles, as appears from the Epiſtles to the</hi> Corinthians</q>

Since he has mentioned the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> it leads me to make one Obſervation, which may perhaps be of ſome Direction to us in forming a Judgment, as to the Truth of Mr. <hi>Layman's</hi> Maxim, That in Scripture-times a Church conſiſted of <hi>all</hi> the Chriſtians of a <hi>City,</hi> how many Congregations ſoever they made. Now, if it be ſuppoſed, that there was a Plurality of Chriſtian Congregations in the City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> then we may naturally be led to apply to them that Paſſage in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. where the Apoſtle prohibits <hi>their Women's ſpeaking in the</hi> CHURCHES. It ſeems to intimate a <hi>Number</hi> of Churches in that City, if there be any Weight in that Obſervation, <q>That it is not to be thought, he would <hi>particularly</hi> have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>their</hi> Women, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, if he had not meant the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> where they were likeſt to uſurp that Authority.</q> It has been often aſſerted by our Adverſaries with Confidence, that it doth not once fail, That where Churches are mention'd in the <hi>Plural,</hi> they are the Churches of a <hi>Province;</hi> not of a <hi>City:</hi> But it ſeems, here it fails for once.</p>
                     <p>I will ſuppoſe then, that there were <hi>Pariſh-Churches</hi> in the City of <hi>Corinth:</hi> and I have Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Authority for it, That when the Epiſtles to them were written, they were under <hi>the Care of Presbyters,</hi> without a fixed Preſident. But, ſays he, "<hi>ſtill under the Government of the</hi> APOSTLES" 'Tis granted, the Apoſtles might ſuperintend the Churches every where. The Direction and Influence of inſpired Apoſtles ſeem'd very needful in the Infant-State of the Church; and they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally travel'd about, doing Good, confirming the Souls of the Diſciples, planting and eſtabliſhing of Churches. But yet, were the Churches, that had only <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Biſhops, without a fix'd Governor, any MORE <hi>under the Government of the Apoſtles,</hi> than other Churches, where theſe fix'd Governors are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be in place? Were not theſe fix'd <hi>Preſidents</hi> as much under their ſuperintendency, as the Presbyters? Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> ſays (<hi>p.</hi> 65.) <q>
                           <hi>I am ſure no Biſhop in</hi> England <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to more Authority over the Clergy and People of his Dioceſs, than the Epiſtles of St.</hi> Paul <hi>give to</hi> Timothy <hi>&amp;</hi> Titus:</q> what Truth there may be in this, I will not ſtay to examine; tho' I believe, the Gentleman would be hard put to it to make it out: However, I muſt return him this Obſervation. That I am ſure many a <hi>Presbyter</hi> in <hi>England</hi> has no greater Marks upon him of Subjection to his Biſhop, than do appear on <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> at leaſt theſe Prelates appear in as
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:003651_0123_10023D051D727F78"/>much Subordination to and Dependency upon this Apoſtle, as the Presbyters of <hi>Corinth;</hi> which may eaſily be made evident, by comparing the ſeveral Epiſtles to them reſpectively. But whether they were <hi>equally</hi> ſo, or not; yet if <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> notwithſtanding their prelatical Character, were at all <hi>"ſtill under the Government of the Apoſtles,"</hi> it ſuffices to my Purpoſe, and proves the Vanity of this Objection in the Caſe of the <hi>Presbyters.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here the Gentleman ſeems to intimate, that the Apoſtles kept the Government of the Churches in their own hands, and manag'd it themſelves, as long as they cou'd; but at laſt thro' the Exigence of the Caſe, and as a Remedy to Schiſms, not ſo well prevented by <hi>their own</hi> Government, they at length threw it up, and out of Neceſſity appointed <hi>fixed Governors</hi> over the Clergy &amp; People in <hi>their own Room.</hi> I wiſh he wou'd give as the Scripture-Account of this Fact; for I can't let it paſs for <hi>a notorious, univerſal, glaring matter of Fact.</hi> Nor can I let <hi>Jerom</hi> ſtand for a Witneſs to it; methinks he liv'd too <hi>late</hi> to be an Evidence in the Caſe: neither indeed do I know, that he has pretended to be one.

                     <p>And as to the Notion of the Apoſtles appointing <hi>fixed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents</hi> over the Clergy, in their <hi>own Time,</hi> will Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> pleaſe to accept Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi>'s Judgment in the Caſe, after he had <hi>ripen'd his Studies</hi> in Antiquity (<hi>Unreaſ. of Sep.</hi> p. 269.) where he obſerves; <q>In the <hi>Preface</hi> before <hi>the Book</hi> of <hi>Ordination,</hi> it is ſaid, That <hi>it is evident— that from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Time there have been theſe Orders</hi> &amp;c. What is the Reaſon that they expreſs it thus, FROM <hi>the Apoſtles Time,</hi> rather than IN <hi>the Apoſtles Time,</hi> but that they believed, while the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> LIVED, <hi>They</hi> managed the Affairs of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>themſelves:</hi> — While the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> lived, it is
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:003651_0124_10023D2966988228"/>probable there were no <hi>fixed Biſhops,</hi> or but few: But as they went off, ſo they came to be ſetled in the ſeveral Churches.</q>—The Dr. indeed appears for <hi>unſetl'd</hi> Governors beſides the Apoſtles in their Life-time; ſuch as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi> But thinks there were no <hi>fixed</hi> Biſhops, or but few. So then, it ſeems, 'tis doubtful whether during the Apoſtolic Age the Churches had any ſuch fixed Governors at all; but continu'd all that while under the <hi>Guidance</hi> of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Pariſh-Biſhops;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s fixed <hi>Preſidents</hi> came in <hi>after</hi> the Apoſtles time. The Preſidency then in Scripture-times, for ought I can learn, was an <hi>unfixed Itinerant</hi> Thing; this is the beſt, that Scripture-Example can be pleaded for: and over this, it ſhou'd ſeem, there was the Preſidency of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves. Surely, whether it was a fixed or unfixed Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> will allow, that the Apoſtles reſerv'd to themſelves the ſame Power of Superintendency they had, while the Churches were under the <hi>Presbyters</hi> only. I ask this Gentleman to tell me plainly, whether his ſuppos'd <hi>fixed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors</hi> were the Apoſtles <hi>Succeſſors, in codem Gradu,</hi> upon an exact <hi>Par</hi> with them: or were they their <hi>Subſtitutes,</hi> Delegates, and Repreſentatives? In ſhort, were they <hi>ſupreme</hi> Governors, or only <hi>Sub</hi>-Governors? A direct Anſwer to this plain ſhort Queſtion will perhaps go a great way towards deciding the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Controverſy. If he ſays, they were the <hi>former,</hi> I think it will be inconſiſtent with all the Accounts of Fact we have in Scripture: and if he ſays, they were the <hi>latter,</hi> then I doubt no Argument can be drawn to his Purpoſe; for the <hi>Deputies,</hi> we may rationally think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ceaſed with their <hi>Principals,</hi> and cou'd have no <hi>Succeſſors.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In fine, ſhou'd we allow there were actually <hi>fixed</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in the Apoſtles times, yet it muſt be remembred, They were but <hi>City</hi>-Preſidents, and <hi>fixed</hi> within thoſe narrow Bounds; and where it happen'd there was but one Congregation in a City, there cou'd be but a <hi>Pariſh</hi> Preſident. And I can't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe at preſent, how any Argument can be drawn from either of theſe Preſidents, in favour of modern Epiſcopacy; which, whether it be conſider'd as <hi>National, Provincial,</hi> or only <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> is a vaſt Remove from the <hi>ancient</hi> Epiſcopacy. If we ſhou'd own Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Preſidents, as appointed by the Apoſtles; yet a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> over <hi>many</hi> Cities, an <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> over a whole <hi>Province,</hi> and a <hi>Primate</hi> over all <hi>England,</hi> muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be beſide Scripture-Inſtitution &amp; Example; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Peter's</hi> Supremacy among the Apoſtles be pleaded.

For, as one obſerves, "As the <hi>Biſhop</hi> can do all by the <hi>Parochial</hi> Clergy, for Word and Sacraments, and by <hi>Chancellors, Archdeacons</hi> &amp;c. for his Diſcipline, ſuch as it is; and as the <hi>Primate</hi> can rule a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church</hi> by his and the Biſhops <hi>Courts:</hi> So can the <hi>Pope</hi> rule the Church Catholick (whitherſoever ſcattered over the whole Earth) by <hi>Cardinals, Patriarchs, Metropolitans, Biſhops,</hi> by his <hi>Legate,</hi> and other Officers of his Appointment". And I challenge Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> to ſhew any eſſential Difference in theſe two Caſes.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I obſerve, our Author attempts to illuſtrate and confirm his preceeding Remarks, by a Variety of <hi>Examples,</hi> or Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of particular Churches ſo form'd and ſettled, as he had repreſented the Caſe, in Scripture-times.</p>
                     <p>And here (<hi>p.</hi> 64) he begins with JERUSALEM, the Mother-Church, of which he will have St. <hi>James</hi> to be the firſt Biſhop. But it ſeems to me, to lie as an inſuperable Prejudice againſt this Opinion, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did for a great number of Years (if Antiquity gives us a true Report) make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the place of their uſual <hi>Reſidence,</hi> after their Travels reſorting thither as their head-quarters; one or other of them gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally being on the Spot: So that the Apoſtles having that Church almoſt continually under their own Eye, it ſuperſeded all Occaſion for a fixed Preſident, and defeats all Pretences therefore of <hi>James</hi>'s being the firſt Biſhop there. However, I will conſider what Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> has to ſay upon the head.</p>
                     <p>I obſerve, to put a Colour on this Notion, he quotes ſeveral Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 21.18. Yet he <q>
                           <hi>pretends not an undoubted Concluſion from Scripture for it</hi> (as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to us, <hi>p.</hi> 98.) <hi>but only this, That ſeeing the moſt ancient Writers from the beginning have conſtantly aſſerted him to be the firſt Biſhop of</hi> Jeruſalem, —<hi>thoſe Texts ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in that Senſe.</hi>
                        </q> And the Gentleman appears very angry at <hi>Elutherius</hi> for calling this a <hi>Whimſical Plea,</hi> as hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon "<hi>all Antiquity,</hi> which <hi>with one Voice ſays, that St.</hi> James <hi>was the firſt Biſhop of</hi> Jeruſalem". But I take leave on this Occaſion to remind Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> of his own <hi>Poſtulate:</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="unknown:003651_0125_10023CD5A8D5FEA8"/>for if the <hi>ſame Word may be us'd in different Senſes, in different Ages,</hi> he ſhould firſt have ſhewn us, that the Word <hi>Biſhop</hi> was uſed in the <hi>ſame</hi> Senſe by the <hi>Fathers</hi> from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as it bears in the <hi>preſent</hi> Age: But the Gentleman has with his own kind hand confounded any Pretence of this nature. For he himſelf has told us (<hi>p.</hi> 68.) That <q>
                           <hi>the Word</hi> Biſhop <hi>was</hi> but <hi>by</hi> DEGREES <hi>appropriated to the firſt Order</hi>:</q> and he has fix'd the Date of this Fact after the Time of the firſt Writer among the Chriſtian Fathers, if I underſtand him right; for having quoted <hi>Clemens,</hi> he ſays (<hi>p.</hi> 106.) <q>

But I am of Opinion, it may as well be apply'd to the Period of his Life; and that for this Reaſon, becauſe if the beſt Accounts may be credited, that <hi>Father</hi> died within about ſeven, eight, or nine years after his writing this Epiſtle: For <hi>Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſts,</hi> I ſuppoſe generally, place his <hi>Death</hi> about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Century; ſome in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Year thereof; tho' others place it in the laſt Year of the <hi>firſt</hi> Century: And ſome of the beſt Chronological Authors date his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> Anno 93, which was but <hi>two</hi> years after his being choſen Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> (Compare <hi>Calviſius</hi> and <hi>Iſaacſon.</hi>) We may then very rationally conclude, that the <hi>Synonimous Uſe of the Words</hi> Biſhop <hi>and</hi> Presbyter continu'd at leaſt to the End of the firſt Age.</p>
                     <p>And from hence I draw this Inference, in Contradiction to Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> That if <hi>James</hi> was <hi>from the Beginning</hi> call'd Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet here's a Courſe of fifty years (the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in which he is repreſented by our Author <hi>acting as a Governor or Superintendent,</hi> being <hi>A.

                           <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> Paul (ſays he, <hi>ibid.</hi>) <hi>returning to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.18. <hi>is ſaid,</hi> to go in unto <hi>James</hi> and the Elders, i. e. <hi>his Presbytery being preſent.</hi>

Surely one might be tempted by this Reflection to think, St. <hi>James</hi> was not really (however nominally) a Biſhop in the <hi>hierarchick</hi>-Senſe, but rather a <hi>Congregational</hi> Biſhop; or at moſt but a Preſident of the <hi>Claſſical</hi> Stamp, the <hi>Moderator</hi> of an Aſſembly of Elders: The Presbyterians will conſent with one Voice, I doubt not, to an Epiſcopacy of this kind.

I deſire the Gentleman to ſolve this Difficulty, in his next. Were the Biſhops in every City ſubordinate to <hi>Titus,</hi> as a common Governor over all? Or was he limited to one City? Or how was it? If he was <hi>limited,</hi> with what Propriety could he be call'd Biſhop of <hi>Crete?</hi> unleſs there was but <hi>one Church</hi> in the whole Iſland; which indeed is what Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> ſuppoſes, when he uſes the Phraſe <hi>"That Church",</hi> and again "<hi>the Church of</hi> Creet:" but this is Language, I believe, he won't find in all Antiquity. <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi> calls him only <hi>Biſhop</hi> IN <hi>Crete:</hi> but <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſpeaks of him as "<hi>Over the</hi> CHURCHES <hi>of</hi> Crete", <gap reason="foreign">

And if he was <hi>not</hi> limited, but had an extenſive and equal Power over all the Cities, and their Biſhops, neither could he in that Caſe be properly call'd <hi>Biſhop</hi> of Crete; for his extenſive Power ſpeaks him rather a <hi>Metropolitan</hi> or <hi>Primate.</hi> And truly I believe, there may a much better Shew of Argument be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:003651_0126_1002025E440B00F0"/>both out of Scripture &amp; Antiquity, for his being a Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>Primate,</hi> than a <hi>City-Prelate.</hi> Hear what the learned <hi>Nicolſon</hi> ſays to this purpoſe (<hi>Apology</hi> for Church of <hi>Engl.</hi> p. 62, 3.) <q>What more decent among Church-governours, than that ſome be Superiours, ſome Subordinate? — Even among the Twelve were there not <hi>Chief</hi> Apoſtles?—For <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are called <hi>Pillars.</hi>— Thus it is with their Succeſſors the <hi>Biſhops:</hi> they are all <hi>pares Poteſtate;</hi> in the Power, he that is at <hi>Eugubium,</hi> is as great as he at <hi>Rome</hi> &amp;c. But yet for all this, one Biſhop may be ſet in a <hi>higher Degree</hi> than another, and one ſet <hi>over</hi> another.— What was <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy?</hi> were they not more than ordinary Biſhops? <hi>Titus</hi> had the Charge over the whole Iſle of <hi>Crete,</hi> in which there were <hi>ſeven</hi> Biſhops beſides.

                        </q> Will he now accept the Teſtimony of that <hi>approv'd Writer</hi> to this matter of Fact! If he refuſes, with what face can he expect, others ſhou'd pay any Deference to that Father's Authority?

I argue upon it, Either <hi>Timothy</hi> was the fixed Governor of the <hi>Epheſian</hi> City-Church, or he was not: which will Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> now upon ſecond Tho'ts chuſe to do; deny, or affirm?

                           <hi>That in the Church at</hi> Epheſus <hi>there were many Elders or Biſhops; and that at firſt it was taken Care of by</hi> Presbyters (as the Caſe ſeems to be every where elſe) <hi>ſtill under the Government of the</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>till ſuch Time as they</hi> ſaw fit to <hi>appoint fixed Governors</hi> &amp;c.</q> Now, by all that I can find in Scripture, the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Church was never taken out of that firſt State; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd thro' Scripture-times taken Care of by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> ſtill under the Inſpection of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in particular. There's
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:003651_0127_100202A6D1C92960"/>a general Conſent of Hiſtory, that this Apoſtle had his proper Home at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> &amp; that there he died juſt before the Cloſe of the firſt, or upon the Commencement of the ſecond Century, when he was about 90 years old; tho' ſome ſay, he liv'd to 120, which muſt bring him nigh 30 years into the <hi>

                           </gap>d</hi> Century. Now if that Apoſtle uſually reſided at <hi>Epheſus</hi> all his days, it ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded the Neceſſity of a fixed Governor there; whatever there was elſewhere. Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> (p. 63.) gives this as the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the Apoſtles appointing fixed Governors in any place, <q>
                           <hi>They finding their Work too great, and their Charger too extenſive for themſelves.</hi>
                        </q> But this is a Reaſon, that cou'd very little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Caſe of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> cou'd eaſily ſuperintend, it being his Home. I find an Epiſcopal Author obſerving; <q>When the APOSTLES <hi>departed</hi> from any Church, which they had planted, in that <hi>then</hi> they appointed a <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop.</hi> For while <hi>They</hi> remain'd <hi>in</hi> or <hi>near</hi> the Place, there was no ſuch <hi>Need;</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſupplying the Wants of thoſe Churches with their Preſence, Letters and Meſſengers. But when they were <hi>finally</hi> to forgo <hi>thoſe Parts,</hi> then they <hi>began</hi> to provide for the Neceſſity and Security of that Church by ſettling <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Power.</q> (<hi>Nicolſ.</hi> Apol. <hi>p.</hi> 57, 8.) Indeed the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> makes this Remark in relation to the Caſe of <hi>Timothy;</hi> who, he thinks it probable, was made Biſhop, when <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Miletum.</hi> Therefore it follows; <q>St. <hi>Paul</hi> at this time was to take his Leave of the Churches at <hi>Aſia;</hi> he ſaith it plainly (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.25.) That <hi>they ſhou'd ſee his face no more:</hi> moſt probable then it is, that at this time he left <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſupply his place a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
                        </q> Nay, but verily it ſeems much more probable, in my humble Opinion, that he did <hi>not</hi> leave <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſupply his place; there being manifeſtly <hi>no Occaſion</hi> for it, in as much as they had the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſo much among them, and <hi>ſaw his Face</hi> very frequently, who was certainly ſufficient to ſupply the place of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul.</hi> If it be Fact, that St. <hi>John</hi> had his Reſidence chiefly at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> then I preſume to turn that Remark of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> (for ſo I take him to have been) I ſay, to turn the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation againſt himſelf; <hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>while they</hi> (i. e. any of the Apoſtles) <hi>remain'd in or near any place, where a Church was planted, there was no ſuch Need for appointing a Biſhop; the Apoſtles ſupplying the Wants of thoſe Churches with their Preſence</hi> &amp;c. Now according to this, how improbable is it, that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> ſhou'd be made <hi>ſtated Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> when there was <hi>no ſuch Need</hi> for one there, and ſuch abundant Occaſion for
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:003651_0128_10023CDF0E2F6C88"/>him at the ſame time in other places, in or nigh which there was no <hi>Apoſtle</hi> remaining! And if the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s reſiding there be a Conſideration that argues the Improbability of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s being fixed Biſhop there, during <hi>his</hi> Life; then it neceſſarily infers, that probably he <hi>never</hi> was ſo at all, if it be true, what Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> (p. 103.) inſinuates, That St <hi>John</hi> outlived <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I will now briefly compare ſome of the <hi>Probabilities,</hi> on either Side of the preſent Queſtion. As to <hi>Timothy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> obſerves (p. 65.) <q>
                           <hi>The Apoſtle's writing to him once and again, as concerned chiefly at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>plainly intimates, that there was a fixed Relation between him and that Church.</hi>
                        </q> This is the beſt he has to ſay, for <hi>Timothy.</hi> But there's much more of Probability in the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s Caſe. Chronologiſts tell us, St. <hi>John</hi> wrote and publiſh'd his Goſpel at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> ſome dat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it <hi>A. D.</hi> 69. tho' others much later. Between the years <hi>Eighty</hi> and <hi>Nin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Theſe are much <hi>plainer Intimations</hi> of <hi>John</hi>'s uſual Abode at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and ſpecial Affection and Care for the Church there, than any appearing in the Caſe of <hi>Timothy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I'm aware, it will be objected, that St. <hi>John</hi> inſcrib'd his Letter for the <hi>Epheſine</hi> Church, <hi>Unto the</hi> ANGEL <hi>of the Church of Epheſus.</hi> But ſurely this cou'd not intend <hi>Timothy;</hi> if Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Obſervation be juſt (<hi>p.</hi> 103.) <q>
                           <hi>That</hi> Timothy <hi>ſhou'd be living, when the Epiſtles of St.</hi> John <hi>were written ſeems to be a groundleſs Gueſs.</hi>

But thus much for the firſt Objection.</p>
                     <p>I'm aware of another Objection againſt what I have advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, relating to the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Church's remaining thro' Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-times in the Care of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> under the Inſpection of the Apoſtle <hi>John;</hi> It may be ſaid, that St. <hi>John</hi> as an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> being oblig'd to be much in <hi>travelling,</hi> for the Propagation of the Goſpel, muſt neceſſarily be often <hi>abſent;</hi> which made a <hi>fixed Governor</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> abſolutely requiſite. But to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, (1.) It is to be obſerv'd, that not the <hi>occaſional</hi> Abſence, but the <hi>final</hi> Withdraw of an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> from any Place, is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the Reaſon or Occaſion of a Prelate or <hi>fixed Preſident</hi>'s being appointed. And then (2.) I anſwer, This Objection car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as much Force in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Caſe, as <hi>John</hi>'s: for it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was an <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges (<hi>p.</hi> 65.) That "<hi>Evangeliſts were indeed</hi> ITINERANT <hi>Officers.</hi>" Now, if <hi>Timothy</hi>'s being an <hi>itinerant</hi> Officer is thought not inconſiſtent with his being a particular <hi>fixed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor</hi> of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> much leſs can it be imagin'd, that <hi>John</hi>'s being an <hi>itinerant</hi> Officer ſhou'd be inconſiſtent with his retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a general <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Superintendency over the Church there, in common with the other <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches; which, if we believe what Antiquity reports, the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> govern'd to his dying Day.</p>

                        <pb n="122" facs="unknown:003651_0129_10023CCD804A7680"/>
Indeed it's a common, and I think, a material Objection, brought againſt <hi>Timothy</hi>'s being Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> That he was an EVANGELIST: But Mr. Layman <hi>(ubi ſupra)</hi> anſwers, <hi>
                           <q>To ſay this, is to ſay nothing to the Purpoſe, becauſe that Office might be exerciſed by any Order of Officers,</q>
                        </hi> even Deacons: "<hi>One of the 7 Deacons</hi> (ſays he) <hi>being an Evangeliſt.</hi>" But to ſay <hi>this,</hi> I'm ſure, is to ſay nothing to the Purpoſe: he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has given us a <hi>Key</hi> to that Caſe, and has taught us by a following Paſſage (compar'd with what he has ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 62.) to argue upon it; <hi>What if</hi> PHILIP were a <hi>Deacon</hi> (fixed in that Relation to a particular Church) this do's <hi>not at all hinder but that, having ſtood ſome time a Candidate for further Preferment in the Church, and by behaving well in inferior Affairs purchaſed to himſelf a good Degree, he might</hi> AT LENGTH <hi>be ordered by the Apoſtles, to do the Work of an</hi> EVANGELIST, and become an <hi>iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant Officer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But were <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> (as this Gentleman affirms) <hi>indeed itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Officers?</hi> How then cou'd <hi>Timothy</hi> be the <hi>fixed Governor</hi> of a City-Church? An <hi>itinerant</hi> Officer, in a fixed Relation to a <hi>particular</hi> Church, ſeems to me a palpable Inconſiſtency: Here's <hi>"a Combination of Ideas"</hi> indeed, which I want Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Skill to reconcile to the Notions of common Senſe. Yet if that muſt not paſs for an Inconſiſtency, I'm ſure: muſt, An <hi>itinerant Preacher</hi> a <hi>fixed Paſtor</hi> at the ſame time: But Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> is confident, <q>
                           <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> might <hi>take up a fixed Reſidence</hi> in their reſpective Churches, <hi>and yet withal do the Work of an Evangeliſt among the unchriſtianized People there and in the Places adjacent.</hi>
                        </q> — I'm as confident then, the <hi>Prelates</hi> of thoſe Times muſt have fewer Incumbran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, notwithſtanding their <hi>"great Metropolitical Churches,"</hi> and it ſhou'd ſeem, muſt have more Zeal, than our <hi>modern</hi> Prelates: who appear readier to go upon ſome Civil Embaſſy to foreign Courts, than upon the Goſpel-Meſſage to <hi>unchriſtianized People;</hi> ſo far from this (if we are rightly inform'd) that they can hardly find the Heart, or ſeldom get Leaſure, to preach the Goſpel even <hi>at home,</hi> to their own People. Further I obſerve, the Gentleman ſays, They were ORDERED &amp;c. Now it's uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether he do's not uſe this Word in the ſame Senſe, as <hi>his Church</hi> do's in the Book of <hi>Ordination,</hi> where the Ordaining of Miniſters is call'd the ORDERING of them. If ſo, then I perceive, the <hi>Work of an</hi> EVANGELIST is by <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment a Work that <hi>Prelates</hi> are ordered or ordained to. I wiſh truly I cou'd ſee our <hi>Engliſh Biſhops</hi> engaging Heart and
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:003651_0129_10023CCD804A7680"/>Hand in this part of their Work. So I ſhou'd hope, they wou'd do their glorious Maſter much greater and better Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than by attending <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Court-Affairs.</hi> At leaſt If they ſhou'd ſend out their <hi>Delegates,</hi> to goſpelize the <hi>Pagan</hi> Parts of his Majeſty's Dominions, I'm ſure, it wou'd be a noble Attempt, and they might hereby do more Service to the Kingdom of Chriſt, than by ſending their <hi>Miſſionantes</hi> into foreign Parts <hi>already</hi> goſpelized, where they can find in many places only ſmall Parcels of <hi>factious</hi> Perſons to preach to, and muſt ſpend their Zeal in ſetting up <hi>Liturgical</hi> Aſſemblies on the Foundations of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Diviſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>However, as to the Point, <q>
                           <hi>that the Office of</hi> EVANGELISTS <hi>might be exerciſed by</hi> any Order <hi>of Officers,</hi> even DEACONS,</q> Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> happens herein to differ from his judicious HOOK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER, who tells us (<hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

But if this be all that the Gentleman <hi>contends for,</hi> I think in truth he contends to little purpoſe; unleſs it be to the purpoſe of <hi>ſerving</hi> his Adverſary's Cauſe, and <hi>betraying</hi> his own.</p>
                     <p>Thus, I have examin'd (more largely indeed than I at firſt intended) thoſe <hi>Scripture</hi>-Arguments, Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> has offer'd in favour of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Form of Government; and which, he ſays (<hi>p.</hi> 68.) he <hi>"can't but eſteem inconteſtible Evidences."</hi> But if any unbias'd judicious Reader will have the <hi>ſame Eſteem</hi> of 'em, after what has been ſaid in Anſwer, I ſhall much wonder.</p>

The <hi>inconteſtible Evidence</hi> now dwindles away to a <hi>"Probability,"</hi> tho' (as he thinks) <hi>"a very ſtrong"</hi> one; Yet ſtill, I obſerve, it is but ſuch a Probability <hi>"advanced at":</hi> And we all know, a <hi>very ſtrong Probability,</hi> yea a <hi>thouſand</hi> of the ſtrongeſt Probabilities, are not inconſiſtent with the <hi>Poſſibility,</hi>

                        </q> Sure I may exclaim in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his Brother <hi>Dialogiſt,</hi> and with greater Truth and Juſtice, (<hi>p.</hi> 4.) <hi>"O amazing Confidence! to ſay no worſe."</hi> Do's this Gentleman conſider what a <hi>Fundamental</hi> is!

Relig. <hi>paſſim.</hi>) I will juſt give a Hint or two of that great Man's Judgment. He lays it down as a <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> (<hi>p.</hi> 133.) <q>That the Knowledge of <hi>Fundamentals</hi> is drawn from SCRIPTURE.— I cannot know (ſays he) any Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to be a <hi>Divine</hi> and ſupernatural Truth, or a <hi>true Part</hi> of Chriſtianity, but ONLY <hi>Becauſe</hi> the SCRIPTURE ſayes ſo, which is all true: Therefore, much more can I not know it to be a <hi>Fundamental</hi> Truth." He obſerves (<hi>p.</hi> 20.) "Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in Scripture, written <hi>becauſe</hi> they were <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, are thoſe <hi>only,</hi> which conſtitute the <hi>Covenant</hi> between God and Man in Chriſt. But he puts "matters of <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Oeconomy</hi> in the rank of Things evidently not <hi>intrinſecal</hi> to the Covenant, &amp; not <hi>in themſelves</hi> neceſſary to be believed, but only by <hi>Accident,</hi> becauſe they were written.—Tho' all which is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> be <hi>plain</hi> in <hi>Scripture;</hi> yet all which is plain,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:003651_0133_10023D06D9DBFAD8"/>is not therefore written becauſe it was neceſſary: for what Neceſſity, that I ſhou'd know <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>left his Cleak at Troas!</hi>
                        </q> Again (<hi>p.</hi> 36.) <q>A <hi>ſure Note</hi> of a Point <hi>not neceſſary</hi> is, when <hi>Scripture</hi> may, with ſo great Probability, be alledged on both ſides, that Men of <hi>honeſt</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> Hearts go ſome one way, and ſome another.</q> — So (<hi>Pref.</hi> Sect 31, 33.)

                        </q> Now let the learned <hi>Layman</hi> reduce his Doctrine, of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> a <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi> to this Standard.

Relig.</hi> p. 196.) <q>May it pleaſe you now at laſt, to take Notice, that by <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental,</hi> we mean <hi>all and only that which is</hi> NECESSARY.</q> And the whole Current of his admirable Book takes its Riſe from this one grand Principle, That <hi>all things neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are</hi> EVIDENTLY <hi>contained in Scripture.</hi> And what he means by this Phraſe <hi>(evidently contained in Scripture)</hi> ſo often uſed by him, we may collect from that Paſſage (<hi>p.</hi> 82.) <q>The <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is a <hi>ſufficient Rule,</hi> for thoſe to judge by, that believe it to be the Word of God, what they are to believe, and what not;— I ſay, ſufficiently <hi>perfect,</hi> and ſufficiently <hi>intelligible,</hi> in things neceſſary, to <hi>all</hi> that have Underſtanding, whether they be <hi>Learned</hi> or <hi>Unlearned</hi> And my Reaſon hereof (ſays he) is convincing and Demonſtrative; becauſe NOTHING is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be believed, but what is <hi>plainly</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. For to ſay, that when a place of <hi>Scripture,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>ambiguous</hi> Terms, lies <hi>indifferent</hi> between divers Senſes, whereof one is true, and the other is falſe, God <hi>obliges</hi> Men
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:003651_0135_10023D005C0BE2C8"/>under pain of <hi>Damnation,</hi> not to miſtake thro' human Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is to make God a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> and to ſay, that like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he gives no Straw, and requires Brick; that he reaps, where he ſows not</q> &amp;c.—Nay, but Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> will ſay, God has provided us with <hi>Guides,</hi> even the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to interpret to us the Senſe of Scripture in doubtful places. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer again in the Language of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (ibid.) <q>You ſtill run upon a <hi>falſe Suppoſition;</hi> That God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſome <hi>Judge</hi> of all <hi>Controverſies,</hi> that may happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians, about the Senſe of <hi>obſcure</hi> Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: whereas He hath left every one to his <hi>Liberty</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul, Quiſque abundet ſuo Senſu,</hi> &amp;c.</q> And he ſays (<hi>p.</hi> 74) <q>This we know, that none is fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce for all the World a judicial definitive <hi>obliging</hi> Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in Controverſies of <hi>Religion,</hi> but only ſuch a Man, or ſuch a Society of Men, as is <hi>authorized</hi> thereto by GOD. But we are able to demonſtrate, that it hath <hi>not</hi> been the Pleaſure of God to give any Man, or Society of Men, any ſuch Authority. And therefore, though we wiſh heartily that all Controverſies were ended, as we do that all Sin were aboliſht, yet we have little Hope of the one, or the other, till the World be ended: And in the mean while, think it beſt to content our ſelves with, and to perſuade others unto an <hi>Unity of Charity,</hi> and <hi>mutual Toleration;</hi> ſeeing God hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized no Man to force all Men to <hi>Unity of Opinion.</hi>
                        </q>— Words worthy to be engraven in <hi>Letters of</hi> GOLD!</p>
                     <p>If it be thus, why will Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> talk ſo much of the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and go about to <hi>force all Men to Unity of Opinion,</hi> by ſetting up the <hi>unanimous Suffrage of the primitive Church,</hi> for a deciſive Rule in doubtful Caſes! At leaſt why will he attempt to eſtabliſh a <hi>Fundamental</hi> of Religion on the Credit of their Judgment and Practice! Let our <hi>Layman</hi> take the Rebuke from that learned Hand, I have ſo often turn'd againſt him (<hi>Chill.</hi> p 242.) <q>You bring in the Sentence of St. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> but, Why, in a Controverſie of <hi>Faith,</hi> do you cite any thing, which is confeſſed on all hands, <hi>not</hi> to be a <hi>Rule of Faith!</hi> So (<hi>p.</hi> 266, 7.) Neither are <hi>Optatus</hi> his Sayings <hi>Rules of Faith,</hi> and therefore not <hi>fit</hi> to determine <hi>Controverſies</hi> of Faith. — No Antiquity leſs than <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> is a <hi>certain Note</hi> of Truth.</q> If our Lay Adverſary then will have <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi> to be a Matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> a <hi>great Eſſential</hi> of Religion, let him not refer us to <hi>Antiquity</hi> and the <hi>Fathers</hi> for Evidence: Or, if he will adhere to the <hi>Fathers</hi> in this Diſpute, and cite
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:003651_0135_10023D005C0BE2C8"/>any <hi>thing which is not a Rule of Faith, and not fit to determine Controverſies of Faith</hi> (as Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſays) let him then renounce his Notion of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi>'s being a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> a <hi>Fundamental</hi> of Religion. I freely leave it to his Option, which to do: and if he can fairly get clear of this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> he ſhall be <hi>mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I'm aware, it may be objected to me; But has not Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> himſelf publiſh'd, <hi>The Apoſtolical Inſtitution of</hi> Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy <hi>demonſtrated!</hi> Yes, Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> in his Letters menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's it in this remarkable Paſſage (<hi>p.</hi> 86.) <q>
                           <hi>As to Mr.</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth, <hi>if you have any Value for his Judgment, pray read his</hi> Demonſtration of Epiſcopacy, <hi>which never yet was anſwered nor never will.</hi>
                        </q> Well, upon his Motion, I have review'd that ſhort Work; and I find it nothing at all to Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Purpoſe. For what do we read there? Truly not one Word of Epiſcopacy a <hi>Fundamental</hi> of Religion! Not one Word of Epiſcopacy a <hi>diſtinct</hi> ORDER from <hi>Presbyters!</hi> Not one Word of Biſhops having the <hi>ſole</hi> Power of <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Government!</hi> Not one Word in favour of <hi>Epiſcopal Government,</hi> but upon this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that it be "<hi>abſtracted from</hi> ALL <hi>Accidentals</hi>"! And what this Expreſſion may couch in it, he has reſign'd to our own Conjectures. Nay, and when Epiſcopal Government is ſtript of <hi>all Accidentals,</hi> the upſhot of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, is, <q>That it is not REPUGNANT <hi>to the Government left in the Churches by the Apoſtles; that it is</hi> not FORBID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN, that it is not AGAINST <hi>the Apoſtles Doctrine and the Will of Chriſt:</hi>
                        </q> All which are very lean and diminutive Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; and only import, that he thought <hi>ſome kind</hi> of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy <hi>lawful:</hi> which is little (if any thing) more than even <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have granted; ſome of whom have been for <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> taken <hi>ſano Senſu,</hi> as well as he. What an unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Folly then was it, to alledge Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> which makes little or nothing for Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Cauſe!</p>
                     <p>It's obſervable, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> might perhaps conſiſtently enough improve the Fathers in arguing for <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> becauſe this was not a <hi>Fundamental</hi> or a matter of <hi>Faith</hi> with him, but merely a matter of <hi>Opinion,</hi> and <hi>extrinſecal</hi> to the Covenant of Grace; as he ſometimes diſtinguiſhes. Whereas Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> makes Uſe of the <hi>Fathers</hi> to prove a <hi>Fundamental</hi> of Religion; in which the <hi>Demonſtration</hi> can be of no poſſible Service to him.</p>
                     <p>And now whereas Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> boaſts, <hi>It never yet was anſwer'd, nor never will be;</hi> I believe <hi>we</hi> cou'd crack too of Books on our ſide, that never were anſwer'd, and (to
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:003651_0136_10023CF2C97708E0"/>ſpeak modeſtly) <hi>it may be</hi> never will: but all the Reffection I chuſe to make, is, That he happens in this Aſſertion to be agregiouſly <hi>miſtaken.</hi> For, altho' that celebrated Piece can be of little Service to the Cauſe of Epiſcopacy <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and much leſs to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelacy, loaded as it is with a vaſt Aggregation of ACCIDENTALS, that Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> wou'd have thrown away; Yet ſuch Uſe and ſuch mighty Vaunts have been made of that ſmall Performance (unworthy of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> and very ſhort of its ſpecious <hi>Title</hi>) as that ſeveral learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Pens have wrote Anſwers to it. It falls out, I have two of 'em by me; ſome Strictures by Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and a more labour'd Reply by Mr. <hi>Lander,</hi> who has taken the Pains to go through the <hi>Demonſtration</hi> Paragraph by Paragraph, remarking upon every Line and Word of it, and giving a compleat Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation to it.</p>
                     <p>I am oblig'd now to vindicate Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> and <hi>Elutheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> from a Miſrepreſentation of the one, and an Accuſation of the other, which Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> advances in the Words following the forequoted Paſſage (<hi>p.</hi> 86, 7.) <q>
                           <hi>What you cite from</hi> Mr. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth <hi>about ſome Fathers and Councils contradicting others, is evidently ſpoken concerning the latter &amp; corrupt Times of Popery, and not of the firſt &amp; pureſt Ages: and therefore is nothing to your Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but is fallaciouſly introduced</hi>
                        </q> Sure I am, our Lay-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor never read Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Religion of Proteſtants, or elſe has a very bold Forhead, thus to play the old <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Game, by ſhifting off his Words with a feigned <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of Traditions. Did he imagine, by the thinneſt Sophiſm, to caſt a Miſt before our Eyes! No, we have ſeen, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Challenge is <hi>indefinite,</hi> to Traditions of the <hi>firſt,</hi> as well as later Ages, and of the <hi>pureſt,</hi> as well as corrupter Times. Save in that ſingle Point, the <hi>Canon of Scripture,</hi> he challenges all Mankind to produce <hi>any other</hi> Inſtance of Tradition truly <hi>original, univerſal,</hi> and <hi>perpetual.</hi> He traces Tradition up to <q>
                           <hi>the Times of the Apoſtles and our Saviour himſelf</hi> (p. 75) and demands, if there be ANY <hi>Interpretation of</hi> ANY <hi>Scripture, from the Apoſtles delivered down from hand to hand, and from age to age</hi>
                        </q> And to let us know how fully he was reſolv'd in this Point, he ſays to his Adverſary (<hi>p.</hi> 138.) <q>WE ARE PERSWADED, that you CANNOT of ANY Thing make it appear, that <hi>it is Tradition,</hi> but ONLY the Canon of Scripture.</q> What could be ſpoken plainer, or uttered more peremptorily!</p>
                     <p>Had Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> cited the <hi>Place,</hi> where we might find the Paſſages that <hi>Elutherius</hi> quoted from <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> we ſhould
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:003651_0136_10023CF2C97708E0"/>be better able to judge upon the truth of his Charge, That <hi>"they are fallaciouſly introduced."</hi> However, I believe, I can neſs pretty nigh whereabouts our Friend was; and in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the Leaves, I fix my Thumb on <hi>Page</hi> 335th. (Chap. II. <hi>Sect.</hi> 56.) where he has theſe Words; <q>The BIBLE, I ſay, the <hi>Bible</hi> ONLY, is the Religion of <hi>Proteſtants!</hi> WHATSOEVER ELSE, beſides IT, and the <hi>plain, irrefragable, indubitable</hi> Conſequences of IT, well may they hold as a matter of <hi>OPINION;</hi> but as matter of <hi>FAITH</hi> and RELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GION, neither CAN they with <hi>Coherence</hi> to their <hi>own Grounds</hi> believe it <hi>themſelves,</hi> nor require the Belief of it of <hi>others,</hi> without <hi>moſt high</hi> and MOST SCHISMATICAL <hi>Preſumption.</hi> I, for my part, after a <hi>long</hi> and (as I verily believe and hope) <hi>impartial</hi> SEARCH of the <hi>true Way</hi> to eternal <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> do profeſs plainly, That I <hi>cannot find</hi> ANY REST <hi>for the Sole of my Foot,</hi> but upon THIS ROCK ONLY. I ſee plainly and with <hi>mine own Eyes,</hi> that there are Popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popes, Councels againſt Councels [and not only ſo, but as he adds] <hi>ſome</hi> FATHERS againſt <hi>others,</hi> the <hi>ſame</hi> FATHERS againſt <hi>themſelves,</hi> a CONSENT of <hi>Fathers</hi> of <hi>one Age</hi> againſt a CONSENT of <hi>Fathers of another</hi> Age, the CHURCH of one Age againſt the CHURCH of another Age. TRADITIVE INTERPRETATIONS of Scripture are <hi>pretended,</hi> but there are few or NONE to be <hi>found:</hi> No <hi>Tradition,</hi> but <hi>only</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> can derive it ſelf from the FOUNTAIN; but may be plainly prov'd, either to have been <hi>brought in,</hi> in ſuch an Age AFTER <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or that in ſuch an Age, it was <hi>not</hi> in. In a word, there is no <hi>ſufficient Certainty</hi> but of <hi>Scripture</hi> ONLY, for any CONSIDERING <hi>Man</hi> to build upon.

                        </q> For this originates with the <hi>Scripture,</hi> begins at the very <hi>firſt</hi> Times of the Church: and if any Tradition <hi>evidently</hi> takes its Riſe <hi>there,</hi> we ſtand ready to receive it; Yea, if that be the Caſe, we ſhall be content without examining into the Monuments of ſubſequent Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. As Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> ſays (<hi>p.</hi> 84.) <q>How ſhall a Man poſſibly be able to know, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had a <hi>perpetual Succeſſion</hi> of viſible Profeſſors, which held <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> the ſame Doctrine which they <hi>now</hi> hold, without holding any thing to the contrary: unleſs he hath <hi>firſt</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, what was the Doctrine of the Church in the FIRST Age, what in the <hi>ſecond</hi> &amp;c? And whether this be not a more difficult Work, than to STAY at the FIRST <hi>Age,</hi> and to examine the Church by the <hi>Conformity</hi> of her Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine with the Doctrine of the <hi>firſt</hi> Age, every Man of ordinary Underſtanding may judge.</q> Hear alſo what he ſays, (<hi>p.</hi> 80.) <q>Believe then the <hi>Conſent</hi> of Chriſtians, which are now, and have been ever ſince Chriſt in the World, that we ought to <hi>believe</hi> CHRIST; but learn of us, what Chriſt ſaid. (ye) which <hi>contradict</hi> and <hi>damn</hi> all other parts of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Why, I beſeech you? Surely, if they were not at all, and could not teach me any thing, I would <hi>more eaſily</hi> perſwade my ſelf, that I were <hi>not to believe in Chriſt,</hi> than that I ſhould <hi>learn any thing</hi> concerning him, FROM ANY OTHER than THEM <hi>by whom</hi> I believed in him: at leaſt, than that I ſhould learn his Religion from you; who, with <hi>forging</hi> ſo many falſe Stories, and <hi>falſe Authors,</hi> have taken a fair Way to make the faith of all Stories queſtionable:—who make a Profeſſion of <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting</hi> all ſorts of Authors; a ready Courſe to make it <hi>juſtly queſtionable</hi> whether ANY <hi>remain uncorrupted.</hi> For, if you take this Authority upon you, upon the <hi>Six</hi> Ages laſt paſt, HOW SHALL WE KNOW, that the Church of <hi>that
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:003651_0137_10023CF52466E4B8"/>Time</hi> did not uſurp the <hi>ſame</hi> Authority upon the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Six</hi> laſt Ages BEFORE THEM, and ſo upwards, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we come to Chriſt himſelf?</q>—It's remarkable, what be obſerves (<hi>p.</hi> 261.) <q>
                           <hi>Not any Antiquity</hi> therefore, unleſs it be ABSOLUTE and PRIMITIVE, is a <hi>certain</hi> Sign of a <hi>true</hi> Doctrine. For if <hi>the Church</hi> were obnoxious to <hi>Corruption,</hi> as we pretend it was: <hi>who</hi> can poſſibly <hi>warrant</hi> as, that Part of this Corruption might not get in, and prevail in the 5th or 4th or 3d or 2d Age? Eſpecially ſeeing the Apoſtles aſſure us, that the <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity</hi> was <hi>working,</hi> tho' more ſecretly, even in <hi>their</hi> Times. If any Man ask, How could it become <hi>univerſal</hi> in ſo <hi>ſhort</hi> a Time? Let him tell me how the Error of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating</hi> of <hi>Infants,</hi> became <hi>ſo</hi> SOON <hi>univerſal:</hi> and then he ſhall acknowledge, what was <hi>done</hi> in ſome, was <hi>poſſible</hi> in others.</q>

                     <p>Here now, I can't but obſerve, Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> has by theſe few Lines given a home Thruſt to his own <hi>Demonſtration of Epiſcopacy.</hi> Like <hi>Samſon,</hi> he has himſelf cruſh'd the Pillars, this Structure of his leans upon, and ſhaken it down on his head.

One wou'd expect plain Teſtimonies in the Caſe of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> if in any Caſe at all.

                           <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence we have, as much as is ſufficient to ſatisfie a wiſe and good Man.</hi>

I ſhall only inſtance in the learned Dr. <hi>Whithy,</hi> who ingenuouſly gives us his Thoughts in theſe Words (<hi>Pref.</hi> Com. in <hi>Tit</hi>) <q>As to the great Controverſy, whether <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were indeed made <hi>Biſhops,</hi> the one of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the other of <hi>Crete;</hi> I confeſs, I can find NOTHING of this matter in <hi>any</hi> Writer of the <hi>firſt three Centuries,</hi> nor any <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation</hi> that they bore that <hi>Name."</hi>— He ſubjoyns, "I confeſs, that theſe <hi>two Inſtances</hi> abſolutely taken, afford us <hi>no</hi> convincing Evidence for a ſettled <hi>Dioceſan Epiſcopacy.</hi>
                        </q>— What Conſidence then do's it bewray, in Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> to bear us in hand, That <q>
                           <hi>the Epiſcopacy of</hi> Timothy <hi>and</hi> Titus <hi>is a matter of Fact,</hi> wherein <hi>the Probability from Scripture is ſecended with the univerſal Suffrage of Antiquity!</hi>

                     <p>Only I will firſt offer ſome Remarks on what he premiſes, in that occaſional Paſſage (<hi>p.</hi> 105.) <q>
                           <hi>As for Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet, <hi>it is very well known, that when he wrote his</hi> Irenicum, <hi>he was but a young Man, and had not ripened his Studies in Antiquity, and alſo that long after in his Treatiſe of the</hi> Miſchief [I ſuppoſe he meant, <hi>The Unreaſonableneſs</hi>] of Separation, <hi>eſpecially in the</hi> Preface <hi>to it, he does in Effect at leaſt, retract what he had written before. So that you have no Reaſon ſo loudly to boaſt of him.</hi>
                        </q>—As to the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s writing his <hi>Irenicum,</hi> when he
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:003651_0139_10023D0B1D7C7640"/>was but a <hi>young</hi> Man, take the Remark made by one of his Contemporaries, the learned and judicious Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> (Letter upon Occaſion of the <hi>Dr's Miſchief of Separation,</hi> p. 32.) <q>To ſay the truth, the Gravity and Seriouſneſs wherewith that Book was written, appears to have ſo little of the <hi>Youth</hi> in it, in compariſon of the Jocularity and ſportful Humour of ſome of his latter Writings, when he hath been diſcuſſing the moſt weighty and important Caſes of Conſcience, that it ſeems as a Prodigy in Nature, and that he began his Life at the wrong End; that he was old in his Youth, and reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Puerility</hi> to his more grown Age.</q>—Mr. <hi>Howe</hi> further ſays; <q>I conceive, one may ſafely take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Intention was not to retract the <hi>whole</hi> Book. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his Retractation cannot make that which was <hi>true,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>falſe.</hi> The <hi>Reaſon of Things</hi> is ſullen, and will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſerve Men's Conveniences.</q>—Perhaps indeed the <hi>Dr.</hi> really had <hi>chang'd his Opinion in ſome Things:</hi> yet I obſerve, he himſelf do's not poſitively affirm he had, but ſpeaks with Caution, hypothetically (<hi>Pref,</hi> Unr. Sep. <hi>p.</hi> 76.) <q>IF any thing in the following <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> be found different from the Senſe of that Book</q> &amp;c. Nevertheleſs he appears <hi>loth</hi> it ſhou'd be thought, he had alter'd his Judgment in ſome of the moſt material Points; as appears by that Expreſſion I quoted before, (<hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 72.) <q>But after all this, wherein is it that he hath contradicted himſelf?</q> I muſt ſay, if the <hi>Dr.</hi> had really chang'd his Opinion in any matters of Importance, he wou'd have ſhewn more of Ingenuity, by being frank and expreſs in his Retractations, and deſcending to Particulars, than he has done, while he leaves us in the Dark, by lurking in Generals.

We depend not on his <hi>Authority</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Howe</hi>) but on the <hi>Reaſons</hi> he alledged, which if they were fallacious, he ſhou'd have ſhewed <hi>wherein,</hi> and anſwer'd his own Reaſons.</q>—But ſince he hath not done this, I rather take it for an Argument, that the <hi>Dr.</hi> look'd on his <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renicum,</hi> in the Subſtance and main Deſign of it, to ſtand good
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:003651_0139_10023D0B1D7C7640"/>ſtill; and that in the grand Points his Judgment really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd the <hi>ſame.</hi> A Controverſy indeed has been manag'd in Print, on this very Queſtion, Whether Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> has in his latter Writings given the World ſufficient Evidence of the Change of his Judgment, as to the Points of <hi>Church-Power</hi> in general, and <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in particular? between the Doctor, and Mr. <hi>Lowth,</hi> a noted <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Divine. It happens, I have by me a large <hi>Letter</hi> of his to the <hi>Dr.</hi> (printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1687.) therein he profeſſedly examines his latter Writings (particularly the <hi>Unreaſ. of Sep.</hi>) and brings them in for Evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. He obſerves, as to one important Point and mother, nearly touching the Epiſcopal Controverſies (<hi>p.</hi> 80.) <q>It appears, that <hi>That</hi> was not one of thoſe Points, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which <hi>Dr.</hi> St. <hi>ſaw Reaſon to alter his Judgment in</hi> 20 Years time.</q> He charges him with making "the Church of <hi>England</hi> a <hi>Parliament</hi>-Church:" and tells him, his <q>
                           <hi>Definition</hi> of it is much at the ſame as <hi>Socrates</hi> defin'd a Man, <hi>Homo eſt Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal bipes, implume. Diogenes's</hi> Jackdaw was as good a Man, when he had pluckt his Feathers off.</q> He charges him with holding that <q>an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> is ſufficient to conſtitute <hi>true Paſtors;</hi> which (ſays he) <hi>ſavours</hi> too much of the <hi>old Veſſel.</hi>
                        </q> But to omit other Paſſages, he concludes with this, <q>And in the laſt place, You have made NO Satisfaction <hi>at all</hi> to the Church of God, for that <hi>Irenicum</hi>-Doctrine, which equals the <hi>Presbyter</hi> with the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> There is <hi>not</hi> ANY Thing LIKE <hi>Amends</hi> for it in ALL your Writings, that I have met with. It is true, You often ſpeak of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as the moſt <hi>ancient Government derivable from the Apoſtles:</hi> But you have <hi>not any where</hi> aſſerted it in the Number of thoſe <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Practices Apoſtolical, which are</hi> PERPETUAL <hi>and</hi> IMMUTABLE; and <hi>until</hi> you ſay THIS, <hi>all</hi> you can ſay <hi>beſides,</hi> is to NO <hi>Purpoſe.</hi> The <hi>Biſhop</hi> is notwithſtanding, at the Mercy of your <hi>Prince</hi> or your <hi>Presbyters,</hi> when their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſees fit to degrade and depoſe him: There is <hi>no more Obligation</hi> to continue the diſtinct Order of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> than that Order of <hi>Widows,</hi> in the Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi> And thus (Sir) I have ſhew'd, that you have not made due Satisfaction for thoſe Errors in your <hi>Irenicum,</hi> concerning the <hi>Power of the Church in general,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtitution of our Church in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</hi>
                        </q> How fitly may I hereupon return Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> his own Remark! <q>
                           <hi>So that you have no Reaſon ſo loudly to boaſt of</hi> Dr. Stillingfleet.</q> For ought I ſee, he remains <hi>ours,</hi> nigh as much as ever: We have Mr. <hi>Lowth</hi>'s Authority for it, That
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:003651_0140_10023D23ABCD2668"/>the <hi>Dr.</hi> at leaſt has <hi>ſaid nothing to the Purpoſe</hi> effectual againſt us. And I cannot but look upon it, as reflecting a Luſtre on the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> Cauſe, That ſo great a Man, as Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> firſt wrote very much in <hi>favour</hi> of it, when <hi>young;</hi> and then <hi>a long time after,</hi> when he had <hi>ripen'd his Studies in Antiquity,</hi> cou'd find <hi>Nothing</hi> to write in <hi>Oppoſition</hi> to it, that a zealous and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating <hi>Epiſcopalian</hi> wou'd reckon effectual <hi>to the purpoſe.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> had more Wit, than to go our <hi>Layman</hi>'s Lengths: nor indeed has he gone much (if any thing) further, in the point of Epiſcopacy, than Mr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> who founds his whole Demonſtration on a mere Preſumption, and whoſe Epiſcopacy ſtript of <hi>all Accidentals</hi> wou'd be little more than <hi>Titular,</hi> or a <hi>Preſidency</hi> of Order.</p>
                     <p>And now I obſerve, That if what Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, might truly be ſaid to be <hi>to no Purpoſe,</hi> then I'm ſure, Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Quotations from Antiquity may modeſtly enough be call'd <hi>Impertinent:</hi> while it appears, they ſay nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately of the <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Epiſcopacy, pleaded for; nor of an <hi>original inviolable</hi> Right; much leſs of a <hi>fundamental Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> in order to <hi>Salvation.</hi> As for my own part, I frankly confeſs, it wou'd have made but very little Impreſſion upon me, if every one of his <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> had expreſly and fully vouch'd for ſuch an <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> ſince he has been ſo far from proving from <hi>Scripture</hi> its <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> or even its <hi>Exiſtence</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-times. The mere Senſe or Practice of the primitive Church, without evident <hi>Scripture-Authority</hi> to back it, I can never perſuade my ſelf, has Weight ſufficient to determine my Belief or Practice of any Thing, as of unalterable <hi>Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> much leſs as one of the <hi>great Eſſentials of Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing, Antiquity were an adequate Rule; yet nothing ſhort of the <hi>unanimous</hi> or at leaſt <hi>general</hi> Suffrage of Antiquity is ſufficient (even according to Mr <hi>Layman</hi>) to ſatisfy a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inquirer: but which Way can we come at this, with any <hi>Certainty!</hi> Can we ſafely truſt to the Opinion and Report of 4 or 5 <hi>Fathers</hi> living in ſeveral diſtant Ages, be they ever ſo pious and learned, concerning <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> far remote from them, when we are left ignorant of their <hi>Veuchers,</hi> upon the Credit of which the Validity of their Teſtimonies depends!</p>
                     <p>However, ſuppoſing that in this Way we cou'd have the univerſal Senſe and Practice of the primitive Church fully aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to us, ſo as to <hi>ſatisfy every wiſe and good Man;</hi> yet of what Service will Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Witneſſes be to his Cauſe, if after all it be found, <hi>they</hi> ſay nothing to give Light into the

And I am free to declare, that according to my beſt Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion there is not a <hi>ſingle Hint,</hi> in all his Train of Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, clearly aſſerting <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Epiſcopacy, as of <hi>Divine</hi> Right, an <hi>Order</hi> ſuperior to Presbyters, of <hi>perpetual</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, a <hi>great Eſſential</hi> of Religion, and of <hi>fundamental</hi> Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; much leſs proving the Doctrine he advances, to be the genuine <hi>Interpretation</hi> of Scripture, in this diſputed Caſe, by the <hi>unanimous Suffrage</hi> of the primitive Church: all which really belongs to the <hi>Theſis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> has attempted to defend, tho' he was pleas'd very artfully to <hi>leave out</hi> a great part of it in his ſtating of the <hi>Queſtion.</hi>—I cannot but wonder how the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman cou'd be <hi>ſo vain as to pretend</hi> DEMONSTRATION, to boaſt of <hi>inconteſtible Evidences,</hi> and <hi>duro Ore</hi> to talk of a <hi>notorious univerſal and glaring matter of Fact;</hi> when his Evidences (all laid together) do not amount to ſo much as a <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>ſtrong</hi> PROBABILITY! Upon a careful Examination of theſe <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> from the Fathers, I find them either <hi>aliene</hi> to the Point in hand, or <hi>contrary</hi> to Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Side of the Queſtion, or at leaſt <hi>unequal</hi> to the Deſign he produces them upon.</p>
                     <p>No one of his Witneſſes ſingly, nor all of 'em collectively, do ſo much as make it appear probable, That Epiſcopacy of the modern <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Kind <hi>(de facto) univerſally</hi> prevail'd in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church from the <hi>Beginning,</hi> or even in <hi>their</hi> Day; much leſs, that <hi>(de jure)</hi> in their Opinion <hi>this</hi> Form of Government, and <hi>no other,</hi> was for ever to be us'd in the Church; and ſtill much leſs, that Epiſcopacy was eſteem'd a <hi>Fundamental of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> by every Church and Age of thoſe primitive Times. I might eaſily demonſtrate this, but that it ſeems needleſs; and I think, ſince Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> has handed to us his Quotations ſo <hi>naked,</hi> with little or nothing of Comment or Improvement upon 'em, I may ſafely venture to let 'em ſtand juſt as they are, without any Remarks of mine upon 'em Indeed I had taken the Pains to go thro' a diſtinct and particular Examination of them: but upon ſecond Thoughts, for the Reaſon juſt hinted, and becauſe I wou'd not unneceſſarily add to the Lenth of this Work (which has run out to an Extent already very much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding my firſt Intentions) I chuſe almoſt wholly to drop that part of my Performance, as well as the Remarks I've made on a Variety of incidental Paſſages in Mr. <hi>Layman</hi>'s Letters.</p>

                        <q>Ignatius <hi>wrote firſt after the Scriptures were finiſhed</hi> A.

If the latter be his Meaning, it ſerves to ſhorten the Space be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Clement</hi>'s writing, and <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s: or if the former, ſtill we know, that <hi>Ignatius</hi> died within a very few Years after Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-times, and therefore the Date of his writing can't vary much, nor be very diſtant from that of <hi>Clement</hi>'s.

That <hi>Clemens</hi> wrote his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle from <hi>Rome,</hi> of which he became Biſhop in the <hi>12th</hi> Year of <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Reign: who, as ſome Chronologiſts tell us, was created Emperor <hi>A. D.</hi> 81; tho' others ſay, <hi>Anno</hi> 83. So that we muſt conclude, <hi>Clemens</hi> wrote his Epiſtle in or after the Year 93. if not after 95. at which time the words <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> it's confeſs'd <hi>were not yet fixed to ſignifie the different Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> And if this Change was effected at the time of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s writing, then it muſt have been effected either in <hi>Clement</hi>'s Time, or <hi>preſently after.</hi> But now (to make uſe of Mr. <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth</hi>'s way of arguing, in his <hi>Demonſtration</hi>) between <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> and <hi>this preſently after, there was not Time enough for ſo great an Alteration: and therefore there was no ſuch Alteration, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi> in <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Time. And therefore the words <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter,</hi> being confeſſed to remain ſynonimouſly us'd ſo long in the Church, muſt be granted alſo <hi>not</hi> to ſignify <hi>different Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in the Epiſtles of <hi>Ignatius: Quod erat demonſtrandum</hi>— However, ſince this Gentleman declares his Opinion (<hi>p.</hi> 70.) <q>That <hi>St.</hi> Ignatius <hi>is as</hi> CLEAR <hi>and</hi> FULL <hi>for the Epiſcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as Words</hi> CAN <hi>expreſs,</hi>

And I can't but obſerve here, Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> tells us (<hi>p.</hi> 112.) <hi>"Epiſcopacy was truly appointed a Remedy againſt Schiſm":</hi> which is a Conceſſion, that ſeems to me to give a fatal Wound to his Cauſe. For if that was the Caſe, it muſt be acknowledg'd, that as the <hi>End</hi> of the Appointment certainly ſpecifies the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the Epiſcopacy, by Conſequence this makes the ancient Biſhop a mere Preſident for Order's ſake; not an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Monarch,</hi> but a <hi>Moderator,</hi> only <hi>Primus inter pares:</hi> Such as <hi>Peter</hi> is ſuppos'd to have been among the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> And if it can be prov'd, that even <hi>Cyprian,</hi> the lateſt of his 5 Witneſſes, meant nothing more by Epiſcopacy, than this <hi>Primacy of Order,</hi> I truſt Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> will freely excuſe me from offering any particular Reflections on his other Teſtimonies of a prior Date, as being indeed altogether needleſs.</p>

                     <p>The Occaſion of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s writing his Diſcourſe <hi>of the Unity of the Church,</hi> was the Schiſms made by ſetting up of <hi>Anti-Biſhops,</hi> or one Biſhop in Oppoſition to another, which Caſe happen'd both in <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Carthage.</hi> The main Drift hereof (as an <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Author repreſents it) is <q>to ſhew the horrid Impiety of rebelling againſt the duely and canonically E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and Ordain'd and Orthodox Biſhop of any particular Church, or ſeparating from him, or ſetting up as an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop in Oppoſition to him: and his firſt and chiefeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is, That our Lord founded his Church on St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and thereby inſtituted Epiſcopal Government.</q>—The Truth is, <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Writings very frequently alledges <hi>Peter</hi> as the firſt and great Example of the Epiſcopal Dignity, and founds the Subjection of the Presbytery to one Biſhop chiefly, if not only, on that Scripture, <hi>Tu es</hi> Petrus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He do's ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the Paſſage cited by Mr. <hi>Layman,</hi> from <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 33. and the Quotation I have made, ſerves for a Commentary on that: but I'm confident, neither of'em affords any Teſtimony to the Cauſe this Gentleman is defending.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems to me, if <hi>Cyprian</hi> had believ'd Epiſcopacy to be by Divine Inſtitution a Superior <hi>Order</hi> to Presbytery, he would never have contented himſelf with alledging this Scripture, <hi>Tu es Petrus;</hi> when he was ſo warmly engag'd in Defence of the Epiſcopal Honour, againſt ſome <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who he thought had made a bold Invaſion upon it.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. It follows in my Quotation from <hi>Cyprian;</hi> 
                        <q>Altho' to all the Apoſtles Chriſt gave EQUAL POWER, when he ſaid, <hi>As the Father hath ſent Me, ſo ſend I You, Receive ye the holy Ghoſt: If ye remit to any one his Sins, they ſhall be remitted,</hi> &amp;c. The SAME as <hi>Peter</hi> was, were even the other Apoſtles alſo, being EQUAL Partners both in <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſee, <hi>Cyprian</hi> puts all the Apoſtles on a Level, as of one Order and Office; and allows no one a Superiority of Power, or eſſentially diverſe Dignity, above the reſt. What ſhall we make then of the <hi>Epiſcopal Honour,</hi> he ſuppoſes <hi>conſtituted, when Chriſt ſaid,</hi> Thou art <hi>Peter; from whence by the Turns of Times and Succeſſions the Appointment of Biſhops hath run on?</hi> It's moſt evident, <hi>Cyprian</hi> holds the Apoſtles to be all <hi>Pares Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latu,</hi> equal in Apoſtolic Honour and Power; and therefore by the <hi>Epiſcopal Honour</hi> inſtituted in <hi>Peter,</hi> he muſt intend ſomething conſiſtent with the <hi>Parity</hi> he aſſerts: and therefore he muſt intend a mere Priority, Precedency, or Preſidency of Order; ſuch as is commonly practis'd in a Society of Equals, where <hi>One</hi> has ſomething of Preeminence allow'd him, for the better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of Proceedings, and avoiding of Confuſion I know, <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſays, "The Biſhop has the <hi>ſublime Top</hi> of the Prieſthood": But this means no more than the Fathers intended, when they call'd <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Top,</hi> the <hi>high Honour,</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of the Apoſtles: ſtill aſſerting an Equality in Power, and Identity of Order; and therefore holding <hi>Peter</hi>'s Primacy to be but a Preſidency, for Unity and Concord's ſake. Of this Nature, by Conſequence, very apparently and neceſſarily muſt be the <hi>Epiſcopal Honour,</hi> which <hi>Cyprian</hi> pleads for as <hi>deſcending</hi> to future Times. For <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> being the <hi>Example</hi> and firſt Inſtance of Epiſcopal Honour, what Prerogative <hi>he</hi> had above the reſt of the Apoſtles, THIS and <hi>no more</hi> may the <hi>Biſhop</hi> claim above the other Presbyters in his Church. Hence it appears to me demonſtrated, beyond the power of Contradiction, That <hi>Cyprian</hi> believ'd the <hi>Parity</hi> of Biſhops and Presbyters, as alike ſucceeding to the Apoſtles; Knowing nothing of a diſtinct Order of <hi>ſimple</hi> Presbyters (as in the Church of <hi>England</hi>) ſubordinate to Biſhops by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
                     <p>It is the moſt glaring Abſurdity, to ſuppoſe that our Lord thoſe Words, <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> inſtituted an Imparity of Order mong the Apoſtles; and if not among the Apoſtles, then a
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:003651_0144_10023D02A2A4A318"/>(by that Argument) among the ordinary Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: And unleſs Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> will fix this Abſurdity on <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> (which indeed wou'd be but to expoſe himſelf) let him never more attempt to prove <hi>Dicceſan</hi> Epiſcopacy from any ſuch Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies of that Father. I'm as much miſtaken, as poſſible in any thing, if the very Quotation he has bro't againſt us from <hi>Cyprian,</hi> taken in a comparative View together with that I've produc'd, do's not give as dangerous a Blow to the <hi>Prelacy</hi> he defends, as almoſt any thing that can be fetcht from Antiquity, or Scripture. I ſhall therefore without the leaſt Anxiety, wait to ſee what artful Shifts he will invent, to ſalve a lame and wounded Cauſe.—And go on now to obſerve,</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Cyprian</hi> adds, <q>Yet to declare <hi>Unity,</hi> the Lord by his Authority diſpoſed the Original of the ſame Unity, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>One.</hi>—The Beginning proceeds from <hi>Unity,</hi> to ſhew the Church <hi>One.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Father urges it as an Argument againſt <hi>Anti-Biſhops,</hi> That the Church was at firſt built on ONE, <hi>Tu es Petrus.</hi> It's a celebrated Maxim of his in this Tract, <hi>Epiſcopatus eſt unus enjus a ſingulis in ſolidum pars tenetur.</hi> This one Epiſcopate he makes to begin in <hi>Peter,</hi> and from him (it ſeems) communicated, and branched forth. He ſays (<hi>Ep</hi> 43. p. 229.) <hi>Deus unus, &amp; Chriſtus unus, &amp; una Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, &amp; Cathedra una ſuper</hi> Petrum <hi>Domini voce fundata.</hi> 
                        <q>God is one, and Chriſt is one, and there is one Church, &amp; <hi>one Chair</hi> founded on <hi>Peter</hi> by the Voice of the Lord.</q> From hence he collects, there ought to be but <hi>our Biſbop</hi> in a Church. <hi>The Beginning ariſes from Unity, to declare the Church is one:</hi> And by the Tenor of his Diſcourſe <hi>De Unitate Eccleſiae, Cyprian</hi> thought that <hi>one Epiſcopate</hi> was not only deſign'd as an Emblem of <hi>one Church,</hi> but alſo as a <hi>Means</hi> to promote Unity, Order and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Church. His main Scope is, That for the avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Schiſms and Confuſions there muſt be one Biſhop in a Church. With that View, as <hi>Peter</hi> was ſet over the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſo in every Church there ought to be one Biſhop, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Cyprian.</hi> But now to <hi>that End</hi> it is ſufficient, if the Biſhop be only a <hi>Moderator,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> was: and therefore at moſt <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Biſhop can mean no more than a <hi>fixed</hi> Moderator; which is reconcilable with Miniſterial Parity, and far diſtant from Eccleſiaſtical Monarchy. This is clearly evident from the <hi>Analogy of Difference,</hi> between <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles, and the <hi>Biſbop</hi> and his Presbyters.</p>
                     <p>I might now illuſtrate and confirm <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Teſtimony, by
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:003651_0144_10023D02A2A4A318"/>many ſimilar Paſſages in other of the Fathers. But to omit all others, I ſhall place an Aſteriſm on a Paſſage of <hi>Jerom</hi> that ſeems very parallel; who tho' a ſtiff Defender of the <hi>Equality</hi> of Biſhops and Presbyters in Scripture-times, yet Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> will have it (ſo he ſays, p. 9<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </q> Waving all other Remarks, I come to the Quotation from <hi>Jerom,</hi> which ſeems to me a good Illuſtration upon that from <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His Words are theſe; <hi>At dices,</hi> Super PETRUM fundatur Eccleſia: <hi>Licet id ipſum in alio loco ſuper</hi> OMNES <hi>Apoſtolos fiat, &amp; cuncti Claves Regni Coclorum accipiant, &amp; ex aquo ſuper eos Eccleſia fortitudo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidetur: Tamen propterea inter Duodecim</hi> UNUS <hi>cligitur, ut</hi> CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PITE <hi>conſtituto,</hi> SCHISMATIS <hi>tellatur Occaſio,</hi> &amp;c. (Hieron adv. <hi>Jovin.</hi> l. 1.) He is in that place hotly contending for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> and commends him above the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> was a marry'd Man, but <hi>John</hi> a Virgin. In the Warmth of Debate, <hi>Jerom</hi> raiſes this Objection againſt himſelf; "But you will ſay, <hi>The Church is founded upon</hi> Peter": to which he replies; <q>Albeit in another place the very <hi>ſame</hi> is done upon ALL the Apoſtles, and all receive the <hi>Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and on them EQUALLY the Firmneſs of the Church is eſtabliſhed: Nevertheleſs among the <hi>Twelve</hi> ONE is choſen out, for this End, That a HEAD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtituted, Occaſion of SCHISM may be taken away. <hi>But why was not</hi> John, <hi>being a Virgin, choſen?</hi> Seniority had the Preeminence given to it; becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> was a Man in Years: that a mere Youth, and one but a Boy almoſt, ſhou'd not be preferred above Men advanc'd in Life</q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I remark, in the words of Biſhop <hi>Jewel</hi> (Reply, <hi>p.</hi> 190.) <q>St. <hi>Hierome</hi> agreeth thorowly with St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> That <hi>for avoiding of Schiſms, one high Prieſt, that is to ſay, one Biſhop, was by good Policie appointed</hi> &amp;c— To the like purpoſe St. <hi>Hierome</hi> writeth upon the Epiſtle unto <hi>Titus</hi> (cap. 1.) <hi>Theſe Things have I ſpoken, to the Intent to ſhew, That in old time</hi> Prieſts <hi>and</hi> Biſhops <hi>were all one: but that in Proceſſe and by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the whole Charge was brought unto one Man, that the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Diſſenſions might be rooted out.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus, in the Judgment of Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> there was an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Thoughts, between <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Jerom,</hi> as to the Riſe,
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:003651_0145_10023D2B1A271568"/>Nature, and End of the ancient Epiſcopacy. They both make it <hi>deſign'd</hi> as a <hi>politick</hi> means for the Prevention of <hi>Schiſms</hi> and Diſtenſions: they both make <hi>one</hi> ſingle Perſon the Subject or Recipient of it: They both make <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preeminence among the Apoſtles the <hi>Exemplar,</hi> which after-ages took Copy from: <hi>Cyprian</hi> makes the Biſhop but <hi>ſummus Sacerdos,</hi> the <hi>Chief</hi> of the Order of <hi>Prieſts</hi> or Presbyters, and <hi>Jerom</hi> aſſerts the actual <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality</hi> of Biſhops and Presbyters in <hi>old time.</hi> And therefore, it is a rational and neceſſary Inference upon the whole, That the ancient Epiſcopacy was at firſt, both in Intention and Fact, but a <hi>Moderatorſhip,</hi> or Preſidency of Order: and tho' by <hi>Degrees</hi> almoſt the <hi>whole</hi> Paſtoral <hi>Charge</hi> might come at Length to be devolv'd on the Prieſt, call'd <hi>Epiſcopus,</hi> or Biſhop, by way of Eminence; Yet this was conſider'd only as a lawful Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Good of the Church, and never pretended to be founded on a <hi>Divine Right</hi> in the <hi>Biſbop,</hi> by virtue of any <hi>diſtinct Commiſſion,</hi> to a Superiority of <hi>Power</hi> over the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as an <hi>inferior Order</hi> by Chriſt's Inſtitution: the <hi>Presbyters</hi> being only under a prudential <hi>Reſtriction</hi> in the Exerciſe of thoſe Powers, which <hi>Jure originali</hi> they ſtood intitled to in common with the Biſhop. Conſider the Caſe of <hi>Peter,</hi> as Head of the Apoſtles, and it gives you an exact Idea of the <hi>Cyprianic</hi> Biſhop.</p>
                     <p>Now, to ſum up my Argument: If the <hi>Epiſcopal Honour</hi> was inſtituted in the Apoſtle <hi>Peter;</hi> and Biſhops have no Right to any more Power over Presbyters, than <hi>he</hi> had over the reſt of his Brethren: And if the reſt of the Apoſtles were the <hi>ſame that</hi> Peter <hi>was, endued all with equal Fellowſhip, both of Honour and Power;</hi> but <hi>he</hi> choſen out, as a <hi>Preſident,</hi> and appointed the Firſt and Chief, for <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Order</hi>'s ſake; Then it is clearly the Judgment of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the Difference between Biſhops and Presbyters is not <hi>ſpecifick,</hi> but only <hi>gradual,</hi> and conſiſtent with the Sameneſs of Order. And by Conſequence Mr. <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is guilty of a groſs Impoſition upon the unlearned Reader, and an equal Abuſe of that good Father; when he vouches him as a <hi>Witneſs</hi> in the Cauſe of <hi>modern</hi> Prelacy, which differs from the <hi>ancient</hi> Epiſcopacy <hi>toto Coelo,</hi> the whole Heavens over.—Will Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> pretend to know what was the primitive Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, better than <hi>Cyprian!</hi> who (as himſelf obſerves, <hi>p.</hi> 108.) <q>

                        </q> Will this Gentleman face down <hi>the good old Father,</hi> That Biſhops are by divine Right a ſuperior <hi>Order</hi> to Presbyters, having <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over them; and attempt too

                     <p>I hope too, that Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> will no more object to us (as in <hi>p.</hi> 97.) That they are only <hi>"ſome warm unguarded Expreſſions,</hi> wherein <hi>Jerom</hi> may <hi>ſeem to degrade Biſhops into a Parity with Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters";</hi> ſince it appears, there was ſuch a Harmony between that
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:003651_0146_10023D0F0E07B878"/>Father and the ſo much magnify'd <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in their Sentiments about the ancient Epiſcopacy.

                        </q> which Name [tho' Mr. <hi>Layman</hi> citing the ſame Paſſage, p. 108. appropriates it to <hi>Biſbots,</hi> yet Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> obſerves, it) <q>implies not the Relation to <hi>Presbyters</hi> as over them, but to the <hi>People,</hi> and is therefore common both to <hi>Biſbops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters;</hi> for ſo afterwards he ſpeaks, <hi>Nec Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitas habuerit Epiſcopum, nec Plebs Praepoſitum,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

                     <p>Upon the whole I obſerve, The Teſtimony of one ſingle Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop againſt the Imparity of Order between Biſhops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, by Divine Inſtitution, is of more Importance and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity than Ten for it; in as much as it is rational to ſuppoſe, that none will object againſt the Authority they are in, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from it, but ſuch as make more Conſcience of the Truth, than of their own Honour and Intereſt.</p>
                     <p>And (in Mr. <hi>Tong</hi>'s words) <q>I wou'd lay down this, as a juſt Remark upon theſe Proofs out of Antiquity, That <hi>one</hi> Paſſage which expreſly tell us, <hi>what kind of Superiority</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had in primitive times over Presbyters, and <hi>how they came by it,</hi> is of <hi>more Value</hi> in this Controverſy, than a <hi>Score</hi> that barely mention that Superiority: the one ſpeaks di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the Queſtion, the other not. We acknowledge thoſe whom the Fathers call Biſhops, had ſome kind of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, over thoſe called Presbyters; and it is a vain thing for Perſons to ſweat and toil, in proving that which we never deny, but will grant them at the firſt Demand, but the Controverſy turning upon this very Hinge, whether it was a Superiority of <hi>Order</hi> by <hi>Divine</hi> Inſtitution, thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients that ſpeak purpoſely to this Point, are the moſt proper Evidences in this Cauſe.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sect.</hi> XI. I ſhall now finiſh with ſome Remarks on Mr. <hi>Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Manner of <hi>concluding</hi> his LETTERS; that is, with an
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:003651_0146_10023D0F0E07B878"/>Exhortation to <hi>Charity,</hi> a <hi>Vying</hi> with us on that head, and a Teſtimony againſt the <hi>unreaſonably ſevere and hot Expreſſions</hi> of uncharitable Writers, on either ſide. (<hi>p.</hi> 76. and 114.)</p>
                     <p>I heartily joyn with him in the Recommendation of <hi>Charity, Meekneſs, and Moderation, which ſo become Chriſtians.</hi> But I wiſh the Gentleman had been more <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with himſelf: for in the very ſame Breath, while he applauds and urges Charity and Moderation, he expoſes himſelf as miſerably defective in theſe Chriſtian Virtues: and while he pretends to be <hi>"ſorry if any of the Church ſhou'd, at any time, treat any of us with Indecency,"</hi> he at the ſame time falls ſoul of us, in a moſt indecent manner, taxing our <hi>"Miniſtry &amp; Sacraments</hi> as <hi>at leaſt</hi> EXTREMELY <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular"</hi> (p. 114.) and implicitly pronouncing us "HERETICKS and SCHISMATICKS, worthy to be <hi>caſt out of the univerſal Church"</hi> (p. 71.) yet he has the face to boaſt (p. 76.) <q>
                           <hi>We have at leaſt as much Charity for you, as you have for us; for you think us to be as much out of the Way, as we think you are:</hi>
                        </q> But this the Gentleman himſelf confutes, by his own Plea from the <hi>ſafer Side</hi> (p. 115.) where he obſerves, <q>
                           <hi>You allow our Orders to be good, our Biſhops being at leaſt Presbyters; whereas we diſpute yours—: and if your Presbyters are not Biſbops, it is certain they are but</hi> LAYMEN, <hi>and therefore cannot ordain.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I leave every one to judge, who it is that errs moſt on the cenſorious &amp; damning ſide. I think truly this Gentleman ſeems to breath very much the Spirit of the old <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> ſo infamous in the primitive Church for their <hi>ſtingy narrow</hi> Principles, and the <hi>edious</hi> Practices of <hi>Re-baptizing</hi> the Proſelytes to their Party, as being no Chriſtians before, and <hi>Re-ordaining</hi> of Miniſters that came over to them, as being no Miniſters before; <hi>Confining</hi> the true Church to their <hi>own Communion,</hi> and <hi>unchurching</hi> all the other Churches of the Chriſtian World. If St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> cou'd lift up his Voice from the Grave, how wou'd he thunder at theſe Epiſcopal <hi>Donatiſts!</hi> Yet it may be <hi>they wou'd not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, tho' one ſhou'd</hi> even <hi>riſe from the Dead.</hi>
                     </p>
