            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>WO reaſons induce me to addreſs the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic at preſent. The one is, to clear a few plain arguments on a matter of the utmoſt conſequence, from the objections lately made againſt them, in a piece call'd <hi>"The Speech of Joſeph Galloway, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> &amp;c."</hi> The other is, to anſwer the unjuſt accuſations contain'd in that piece.</p>
            <p>To act honeſtly, and to be traduc'd, hath been the fate of many men. To bear ſlanders with temper, and to entertain a proper pity or contempt, for their weak or wicked authors, has been the lot of few. I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to imitate their example: and by propoſing it to myſelf, I hope I ſhall be able ſo far to ſuppreſs the reſentment naturally ariſing from a ſenſe of unprovok'd injuries, that my vindication may be preſented not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptably, nor uſeleſsly, to candid minds.</p>
            <p>COULD I be convinced, that men of ſenſe or virtue, would be perſuaded or pleaſed, by wild declamation or illiberal reflections, I might perhaps be induced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend myſelf, in the ſame ſhattered ſtyle and abuſive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:009640_0005_0F7739404B6F8D20"/>
with which I have been attacked: but as theſe muſt always offend the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> whoſe approbation only is worth wiſhing for, to Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> I reſign the undiſputed glory of excelling in his <hi>favorite</hi> arts—of <hi>writing confuſedly,</hi> and <hi>railing inſolently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preſumptuous indeed muſt I appear, ſhould I venture into <hi>theſe liſts,</hi> againſt a perſon who wields the weapons of wordy war—<hi>the only weapons he dares to wield</hi>—with ſo peculiar a dexterity in his exerciſe, as to feel no kind of reſtraint either from <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>truth;</hi> the regularity of whoſe ſober diſcipline would prove, I preſume, too great a confinement to this advocate of <hi>freedom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN I perceived, that Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> was hardy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to obtrude on the public a <hi>pretended ſpeech,</hi> of which he never ſpoke one ſentence in the Houſe, I was not ſurpriſed to find, that a perſon who treated his own character with ſuch licence, ſhould not be unſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others. But—<hi>why</hi> he ſhould engage in this <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous</hi> project—<hi>why</hi> he ſhould ſo induſtriouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to exhibit me as a villain to my country, for ſpeaking my ſentiments in that place where my country had commanded me to ſpeak them—<hi>why</hi> he has wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly wounded a man, who never deſigned or wiſhed <hi>him</hi> an injury; but has always, as far as his power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, rendered him all the offices of civility—for <hi>what reaſons,</hi> I ſay, he has thus violated the laws of <hi>humanity</hi> and <hi>decency,</hi> his own heart is beſt able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide—The public, with which he endeavours to eſtabliſh <hi>his</hi> character, by deſtroying <hi>that of another,</hi> may perhaps be able to gueſs the <hi>ſecret cauſes,</hi> by which he has been tranſported into ſuch unjuſtifiable exceſſes of rage and rancour againſt <hi>me</hi>—For my part, I ſhall avoid an enquiry, that would only lead me, I fear, to a painful diſcovery of the <hi>depravity,</hi> to which the human mind is ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:009640_0006_0F77394107790660"/>LEAVING then to the impartial world the judgement to be paſſed on Mr. <hi>Galloway's</hi> conduct—Leaving to <hi>him</hi> the enjoyment of the <hi>ſolid ſatisfaction,</hi> that muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the meritorious exploit of ſtabbing publicly a reputation, which has hitherto eſcaped his <hi>inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious attempts,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to perform the taſk impoſed on me by his cruelty, and to defend myſelf from thoſe darts, which with unfriendly hands he has aim'd at <hi>my heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the change of our government, after the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment of the aſſembly in <hi>March</hi> laſt, came to be the general ſubject of converſation, the importance of the meaſure filled my mind with the greateſt anxiety. A ſevere fit of ſickneſs had prevented my attendance when the reſolves were paſt: but I conſidered that at the next meeting of the Houſe, the duties of the poſt which my country had aſſign'd me, would call upon me to act a part of more conſequence, than perhaps would ever fall to my ſhare again, in the whole courſe of my life. Mindful of the truſt committed to me, I endeavour'd to underſtand a matter on which ſo much depended.</p>
            <p>I SOON perceiv'd, that if a change took place, there were two things to be wiſh'd for, which there appear'd to me no probability of obtaining. The firſt was, that the <hi>point</hi> on which we lately differ'd with the governor, and <hi>ſome others</hi> which have been earneſtly urg'd by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aſſemblies, ſhould be determin'd in our favour. The ſecond was, that our <hi>privileges ſhould be perfectly ſecured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT inſurmountable obſtructions ſeem'd to preſent themſelves, <hi>at this time,</hi> againſt theſe attempts. <note n="*" place="bottom">Speech Page 6.</note> 
               <q>What reaſonable hopes of ſucceſs can we entertain, of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe points decided in our favour, while thoſe
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009640_0007_0F7739429C3EB680"/>
miniſters who ſo repeatedly and warmly have approv'd of the proprietors inſiſting on them, are ſtill in power?</q> Our danger not only is, that theſe points will not be decided for us; but, if the proprietors, tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and incenſed, ſhould think proper to ſurrender the government and make their own terms with the crown, is it not highly probable, that they have intereſt enough to make the change in ſuch a manner as will fix upon us <hi>forever,</hi> thoſe demands which appear ſo extremely juſt to the preſent miniſters? Add to this, the <q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable misfortune under which we now labour, of having incurr'd the diſpleaſure of his majeſty and his miniſters.</q> Theſe reflections induc'd me to think and to ſay—that <hi>this</hi> is not the proper time to attempt a change of our government.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway,</hi> by way of prelude to his anſwer to theſe obſervations, endeavours to ſhew that I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted myſelf: but this <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> contradiction is founded on a <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> conceſſion, which I never made— <hi>"of the neceſſity of a change".</hi> My <hi>approbation</hi> of a change, if we can enjoy all the advantages we now do, is call'd, <hi>"a confeſſion that a change is neceſſary".</hi> But certainly it would have been more natural to conſtrue it as it was intended, and as the ſenſe requires—"that, <hi>if we are to loſe nothing by the change,</hi> I am as willing to be under the immediate government of the crown, as of the proprietors."</p>
            <p>AFTER this unſucceſsful attempt to raiſe a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> takes the trouble of attacking the "inappoſite inſtance", as he calls it, relating to the duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> This inſtance was mentioned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm a preceding obſervation; and Mr. <hi>Galloway,</hi> in attempting to anſwer it, <hi>unluckily for himſelf,</hi> points out and enforces the very truth for which it was adduced. He ſays, "the duke failed; and no wonder; for he
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009640_0008_0F77394366A9D7A8"/>
landed at a <hi>time</hi> when the king was ſupported in the <q>warmeſt manner by the parliament, and no one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to promiſe him ſucceſs.</q> Thus, I ſay,— our attempt is made at a <hi>time</hi> when the proprietors are ſupported in the warmeſt manner by the crown, and its miniſters; and no one circumſtance to promiſe us ſucceſs".— But, ſuppoſe the duke had waited till the parliament did <hi>no longer</hi> ſupport the King; but, when they and the whole nation, in the utmoſt dread of popery and arbitrary power, were looking round with impatient terror for a deliverer; and when many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances promiſed that nobleman ſucceſs; is it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he would not <hi>then</hi> have ſucceeded, or that he would have been taken and put to death? Or, if king <hi>William</hi> had made his attempt, before the nation was properly alarmed, is it certain that the revolution would have been accompliſhed with ſuch amazing facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Raſhneſs ruined the one. Caution crowned the other. This is all, I intended to prove.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway</hi> then proceeds, and <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> that all the determinations of the miniſtry, were miſtakes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by proprietary miſrepreſentations. He then <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> that theſe determinations were ſolely owing to the influence of two friends of the proprietors, lately deceaſed: And laſtly he <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> that now there will be a <hi>total</hi> alteration in miniſterial reſolutions.</p>
            <p>THESE <hi>ſuppoſitions,</hi> I acknowledge, are as good ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities as any we have, that the grand points controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between us and the proprietors, will, in caſe of a change, be decided in our favour, or that our privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges will be preſerved. But ſtill they ſeem to be too ſanguine. Let us remember with what <hi>unanimity</hi> the miniſtry at different times have expreſſed their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our conduct; and, that it is only <hi>gueſs-work</hi> to imagine, their reſolutions were dictated by two men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:009640_0009_0F77394409482CC8"/>OF one thing we are <hi>ſure</hi>—that we are in the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſcredit</hi> with the king and his miniſters. The late reſolves prove it. Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> however flatters himſelf, <q>that the prejudices againſt us are not ſo ineradicably fixed, but they may be eaſily overcome, and the province reſtored to her former credit.</q> Happy ſhould I be, if I could perceive the leaſt proſpect of ſo great a bleſſing. By <hi>what means</hi> theſe prejudices are to be overcome, we are not informed; nor can I conceive. Men of great abilities, and of the moſt perfect ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with our public affairs, have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to remove the force of theſe miſrepreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they are called. Mr. <hi>Franklin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charles,</hi> our Agents ſpent ſeveral years in combating theſe prejudices; and, even Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> himſelf, as I have been told, <hi>elucidated</hi> the juſtice of our cauſe with his <hi>uſual perſpicuity,</hi> in reams of writing. Yet after all theſe great labours, his majeſty and his miniſters ſtill retained their former ſentiments. Hence, I fear, that any future efforts for this purpoſe, <q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pretended Speech,—page 30.</note> 
                  <hi>will be</hi> ſwallowed up, and ſacrificed <hi>(as Mr.</hi> Galloway <hi>moſt elegantly expreſſes it) AT</hi> the ſhrine of proprietary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and the meaſures of power.</q> In ſhort, that they will be but <note n="*" place="bottom">

            </p>
            <p>IN confident expectation of theſe improbabilities, Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> is willing to riſque the <hi>perpetuating</hi> thoſe demands, which have been conſtantly made by the proprietors—at a <hi>time,</hi> when <hi>we are certain</hi> that the crown and its miniſters look on theſe demands as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt and reaſonable.</p>
            <p>ONE of his arguments for our riding poſt in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair is—<q>that there are many new colonies to be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009640_0010_0F7739457B860598"/>
ſettled now, and that it would diſcourage <hi>theſe</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, if <hi>our</hi> privileges were to be taken away.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS true it will convince the emigrants, they are not to have ſuch privileges as were granted to <hi>us;</hi> or, if they <hi>have,</hi> and ſhall hereafter <hi>petition for a change,</hi> that they will be taken from them.</p>
            <p>BUT this information, I imagine, will be no diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement.—There is not the ſame <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>America</hi> was then ſo little known, that it was thought the ſevereſt kind of baniſhment to ſend people over to the colonies.</note> reaſon to grant, nor to wiſh for privileges now, that exiſted in the perſecuting days of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond. Grants of land on ſmall quit-rents—furniſhing the neceſſaries of life for the firſt outſet—bounties on labour—and immunities from taxes for ſome years—with the common liberties of other <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſubjects—will do the buſineſs, without the privileges of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>

            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway,</hi> before he quits <note n="*" place="bottom">Pretended Speech—page 21.</note> "this wiſe policy of ſettling the extenſive newly acquired dominions" as he expreſſes himſelf, takes the opportunity of making an <hi>hiſtorical flouriſh</hi>—but unfortunately furniſhes "<note n="‡" place="bottom">Id. pa. 26.</note> irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable demonſtrations" that he is utterly unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſubject, on which he ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>MR. FRANKLIN read in the Houſe, a ſhort extract from Lord <hi>Clarendon's</hi> life, relating to <hi>Barbados.</hi> Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> catched it as it fell from the learned member, and now confidently aſſerts—"that the colony of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bados</hi> had, in the opinion of the ableſt council, <hi>forfeited her charter privileges</hi>—And yet upon this policy only, her privileges were preſerved."</p>
            <p>HE referrs to Lord <hi>Clarendon's</hi> life, for this curious anecdote. What then muſt a man think of Mr. <hi>Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009640_0011_0F773945DCBF8710"/>
who looks into the book, and finds—that the colony of <hi>Barbados</hi> did not forfeit any right—that ſuch an opinion was never given—and that there is not a word relating to her <hi>charter privileges.</hi> Yet this is the truth.</p>
            <p>THE fact was this. <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt granted the iſland of <hi>Barbados</hi> by patent to the earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi>—he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—his ſon leaſed it to lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> for twenty-one years; appointing him governor, and reſerving a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety of the profits to himſelf—the civil war broke out—ended—<hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond was reſtor'd—there being eight or nine years of lord <hi>Willoughby</hi>'s leaſe to come, he pray'd the king to give him a commiſſion to be governor for that time—But the iſland was now much chang'd—it was compleatly ſettled during the troubles—and <hi>chiefly by officers of the king's army</hi>—ſo that now it was of another conſideration and value than it had been—<hi>the king's cuſtoms</hi> yearly amounted to <hi>a very large ſum</hi>—The planters were greatly alarmed at the thought of <note n="*" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Life—vol.

               <q>depending on the earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi> and lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> for the enjoyment of their eſtates, which they had hitherto look'd upon as their own.</q> They applied to the king, <note n="†" place="bottom">Idem. 934.</note> 
               <q>praying that they might not be oppreſt by thoſe two lords. They pleaded, that they were the king's ſubjects; that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired thither as to a <hi>deſolate place,</hi> and had by their induſtry obtained a livelihood there, <hi>when they could not with a good conſcience ſtay in England.</hi> That if they ſhould be now left to thoſe lords to <hi>ranſom</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and <hi>compound for their eſtates,</hi> they <hi>muſt leave the country;</hi> and the plantation would be <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> which yielded his majeſty ſo good a revenue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEY further <note n="‡" place="bottom">Idem 937.</note> 
               <q>poſitively inſiſted, that the charter granted to the earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi> was <hi>void in point of law;</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:009640_0012_0F773946A5AE7430"/>
and prayed that his majeſty would give them leave to proſecute in his name in the exchequer, and at their own charge, to repeal that grant; by which they ſhould be freed from the <hi>arbitrary power and oppreſſion</hi> which would be exerciſed upon them under the colour of that charter; and his majeſty might receive <hi>a great benefit to himſelf,</hi> by taking the ſovereignty into his own hands, to which it belonged—and in that caſe, they offered to make <hi>as great an impoſition</hi> of taxes as the plantation would bear; for the ſupport of the king's governor, and ſuch other uſes, as his majeſty ſhould think fit to direct.</q>
            </p>
            <p>UPON this, the king <note n="*" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi>'s Life, III vol. pa. 938.</note> "referr'd the conſideration of the validity and legality of the patent, to his council at law; who upon full deliberation, after the hearing of all parties, returned their opinion, <hi>that this patent was void, and that his majeſty might take the ſame into his own power;"</hi> not that the <hi>"colony had forfeited their charter privileges."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON this report, the determination was formed in the king's council. And what does this caſe prove—but that the crown would not deprive the <hi>proprietors</hi> of <hi>Barbados</hi> of their charter, tho' the people earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted it—tho' <hi>that</hi> people were faithful ſubjects, who had diſtinguiſhed their loyalty by ſuffering in the royal cauſe—tho' a very great benefit would accrue to the crown—tho' a large ſalary was to be ſettled on the king's governor—and laſtly, tho' the patent was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>void.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF in <hi>ſuch a caſe,</hi> the needy and unprincipled <hi>Charles</hi> would not ſeize upon the intereſts of the <hi>proprietors</hi> of <hi>Barbados,</hi> can it be conceived that his preſent majeſty will ſnatch from the <hi>proprietors</hi> of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> without
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009640_0013_0F7739473523F548"/>
their conſent, the charter that was granted in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſervices performed by their brave and loyal anceſtor.</p>
            <p>I THINK every man in the province <hi>except Mr. Gallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> will immediately diſcover whether the caſe he has quoted, will ſtrengthen his reaſoning or mine.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER of Mr. <hi>Galloway's</hi> arguments is— <q>that the proprietary eſtate is daily increaſing, and thus their influence will increaſe; and therefore they will be more likely in future, to oppoſe with ſucceſs any meaſures that may be taken againſt their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>TO finiſh this argument, he cloſes it with an <hi>imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contradiction</hi> of mine, in my ſaving, "This is not the proper time for a change," and afterwards declaring, <q>that we are not to expect more ſucceſs, becauſe the <hi>proprietaries</hi> will have more dignity, more power; and, as they will think, more law on their ſide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway</hi> certainly takes delight in miſtakes, or he would never have committed ſo groſs an error as he has done here. I ſaid—it could not be expected, that our ſucceſs would be greater when our <q>opponents become more <hi>numerous,</hi> and will have more dignity, more power, and, as they will think, more law on their ſide.</q>
This was intended to prove, that we might find it more difficult after a change, to contend for the preſervation of our privileges, with the <hi>crown</hi> and the <hi>clergy,</hi> (the <hi>opponents</hi> here meant) than with the proprietors. But Mr. <hi>Galloway,</hi> with great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, by changing the word <hi>opponents</hi> for <hi>proprietaries,</hi> creates a contradiction for his own <hi>diverſion,</hi> and the <hi>deception</hi> of his readers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:009640_0014_0F773947C6627DB0"/>HOWEVER—let it be ſuppoſed, "that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary eſtate and influence will greatly increaſe, and that they become the richeſt ſubjects in <hi>England."</hi> I moſt ſincerely wiſh they may, ſince the <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Pretended Speech pa. 14.15.17.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> endeavours to ſhew, that the conduct of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors has not been conſtantly approved by the crown and miniſtry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe five of the thirteen acts oppoſed by the proprietors, were confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—</p>
                  <p>But this oppoſition, even by Mr. <hi>Galloway's</hi> acknowledgment, did not proceed from any private intereſt of the proprietors that was affected by theſe Bills. They were oppoſed, ſays he, <note n="†" place="bottom">id. pa. 7.</note> "as inconſiſtent with the royal prerogative" —And ſurely ſuch an oppoſition could not be much diſapproved of by the crown, as the miniſtry have declared <note n="‡" place="bottom">id. pa. 25.</note> "that his majeſty's royal prerogatives were not to be truſted to the feeble hands of private individuals; who were ever ready to ſacrifice them to their private emolument.".</p>
               </note> increaſe of their wealth muſt ariſe from the increaſe of the wealth and proſperity of <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi> Theſe, I preſume, are not things to be dreaded. <hi>Our</hi> power and influence muſt increaſe with <hi>their</hi> power and influence—and therefore, it ſeems, we ſhall always be as able to cope with them, as we are now—eſpecially if it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that a <hi>family</hi> is more liable to accidents, than a <hi>people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT granting that the riches of the proprietary family ſhall increaſe in a greater proportion than the riches of this province—can it be imagin'd, that they will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any <hi>undue influence</hi> over the crown and it's mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? can it be believed, that the king and parliament will ſuffer two or three ſubjects to tyranniſe over a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant colony, in whoſe welfare <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is ſo much intereſted? To reduce us to the moſt abject ſtate of ſlavery?</p>
            <p>THE ſuppoſition is too monſtrous to be admitted— and I ſhould be ſurprized to hear ſuch language from any perſon, but one who thinks and writes in Mr. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway's</hi> ſhambling way. He <note n="‖" place="bottom">Pretended Speech pa. 23.</note> ſhudders at my ſaying
<q>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:009640_0015_0F77394975FDF5E0"/>
the parliament may perhaps be induced to place <hi>us</hi> in the <hi>ſame ſtate</hi> with the <hi>royal governments</hi>
               </q>— and yet he ſuppoſes, they will tamely tolerate our being made <hi>ſlaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF our proprietors are to become ſuch great and dreadful men—if their influence is to grow ſuperior to juſtice and reaſon—I cannot conceive how the king's <hi>appointment</hi> of governors can ſecure us from them, any more than his <hi>approbation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF that influence ſhall ever be ſo exorbitant as it has been deſcribed, will it not prevail in the nomination of governors? Or in determining their conduct? Can even Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> think that the king's <hi>appointment</hi> will protect us againſt this influence? If he does, I will anſwer him in his own words—and if they do not convince <hi>him,</hi> ſurely he will not be ſo unreaſonable as to expect, that they ſhould convince <hi>any one elſe.</hi>
            </p>

               <q>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pretended Speech, page 10.</note> Let us but conſider that the experience of ages fully demonſtrates wealth to be the parent of power, and the <hi>nurſe</hi> of influence, and that an increaſe of wealth will as naturally <hi>beget</hi> an increaſe of power and influence, as an increaſe of velocity in <hi>the falling ſtone</hi> will produce more certain death.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Let us but take a view of the proprietary eſtate, what it was fifty, what twenty years ago, and what it is now, and we muſt be convinced <hi>that nothing can prevent</hi> their being the richeſt ſubjects in the Engliſh nation: and therefore ſubjects <hi>of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt influence and power,</hi> and <hi>more likely in future to oppoſe with ſucceſs</hi> any meaſures that may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt their oppreſſion.

wealth by ſome MAGIC CHARM in future, will, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of producing power and influence, bring forth <hi>its</hi> contraries? <hi>As vain and chimerical</hi> as the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a future Meſſiah to the deluded Jews.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IF there is any force in theſe arguments of Mr. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi>—if property, from natural cauſes produces power, and can not fail of having this effect—how vain and ridiculous is it to requeſt the crown—to <note n="*" place="bottom">Pretended Speech page 8.—et alibi.</note> 
               <hi>"ſeparate power from property?"</hi> Yet this forſooth! is <hi>all Mr. Galloway,</hi> or the aſſembly according to his explanation, deſires of his majeſty.</p>
            <p>CERTAINLY the meaning cannot be, that the king ſhould take away their eſtates from the proprietors — this would be too glaringly unjuſt. What then can Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> mean, when he deſires "that the king may ſeparate power and property," which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares—and, with prodigious labour, ſtrives to prove—<hi>"inſeparable?" If he means any thing,</hi> I imagine, I have diſcovered his meaning—and, tho' Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> has, in his performance, ſaid many things that have <hi>ſurprized</hi> me—yet this is ſo ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively extraordinary, that I would not admit the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſtruction, unleſs his intention was too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to allow of any doubt. I did not think him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch deſigns. I entertained a better opinion of his loyalty. In ſhort, he plainly means—<hi>as he has declared it cannot be done any other way</hi>—that his Majeſty ſhall turn MAGICIAN—and contrive <note n="†" place="bottom">Pretended Speech pa. 11.</note> 
               <q>ſome MAGIC CHARM, whereby wealth inſtead of producing power and influence ſhall bring forth <hi>its</hi> contraries</q>— <hi>their</hi> contraries I ſuppoſe it ſhould be.</p>
            <p>THIS dread of future injuries being removed— or at leaſt the vanity of attempting their removal, on
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009640_0017_0F77394ACDD66778"/>
Mr. <hi>Galloway's own principles</hi> being proved—I return to the preſent ſituation of affairs.</p>
            <p>IT is univerſally believed, that the preſent miniſtry are deſirous of veſting the government of this province advantageouſly in the crown. Mr. <hi>Franklin</hi> has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſaid it. If this be the caſe, how fair an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is preſented to the proprietors of gratifying their reſentment, if they entertain any againſt the province, and ſecuring their intereſt at the ſame time, by entering into a contract with the crown, and fixing, by an act of parliament, thoſe points, in which the miniſtry have conſtantly ſupported them—<hi>upon all ſucceeding ages?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MANY words are unneceſſary in ſo clear a caſe as this is. Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> allows, the proprietors have ſome ſenſe, and that they underſtand their own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. The ſentiments of the miniſtry have been decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their favor. From thence I think it may be taken for granted, that the proprietors either will not conſent to a change—or that their conſent will be founded on a perfect ſecurity given them for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which appear ſo juſt to the king and miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. What may facilitate this meaſure is, the propoſal of the aſſembly—<note n="*" place="bottom">Pretended Speech pa. 5.</note>" that a <hi>full equivalent</hi> be made to "the proprietors" upon their parting with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. How far theſe words may be conſtrued to extend, will appear from this conſideration. With the <hi>approbation of the crown</hi> the proprietors now inſiſt on certain points which, in their opinion, tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their intereſts. This, the authority veſted in them at preſent, enables them to do. If they are diveſted of this authority, without any ſtipulations for ſecuring their intereſts <hi>hereafter,</hi> as well as they are at <hi>this time,</hi> it will be ſaid that a <hi>full equivalent</hi> is not made for the power they reſign. This ſecurity will therefore without
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009640_0018_0F77394B89987778"/>
doubt, be required—and that requiſition may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo unreaſonable in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> as it does here.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>full equivalent</hi> comprehends ſomething more than the ſettlement of theſe points. The government of itſelf is very valuable—and ſurely we ſhall not deſire the king to pay the equivalent out of his own pocket. If the change therefore is made, I don't queſtion but it will be thought highly reaſonable—<hi>that we ſhould pay for the bleſſing, which we ſo earneſtly requeſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſituation of our affairs being ſuch as has been deſcribed, I could not perceive any neceſſity "impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling" us to ſeize this unhappy period, to plunge this province into convulſions, that might while ſhe was thus diſordered, be attended with the worſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. A gentler remedy appeared to me a properer remedy.</p>
            <p>BUT here Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> exclaims—<q>Shall we pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently wait untill proprietary influence ſhall be at an end? Shall we ſubmit to proprietary demands?</q> By no means! What I deſire, is, vigorouſly to oppoſe thoſe demands; and to try the force of that influence, WITHOUT RISQUING TOO MUCH IN THE CONTEST.</p>
            <p>I THEREFORE made a propoſal to the Houſe, of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moderate nature, which I had the pleaſure of finding highly approved by a <note n="*" place="bottom">The late ſpeaker.</note> gentleman, whoſe acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed integrity, patriotiſm, abilities, and experience will always give weight to his ſentiments with every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial perſon. The propoſal was—"that we ſhould deſire his majeſty's judgment, on the point that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the late unhappy difference between the two branches of the legiſlature." By taking this ſt;ep, we ſhould have diſcovered the ſenſe of the miniſtry on our
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:009640_0019_0F77394D5E2400E0"/>
late diſputes—on other important points which have been controverted with our governors—and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our privileges.</p>
            <p>THUS we ſhould have known what ſucceſs would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend us in any future attempt to effect a change—and what method would be moſt agreeable to his majeſty. But in the preſent mode of proceeding, we have acted with great zeal, I grant—but we are quite ignorant what the event will be, and whether the cenſures beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the proprietors, may not be thought in <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> to be aimed through <hi>them,</hi> at the king. In ſhort, we embark in an enterprize of the higheſt importance; and then look about us to ſee how it may be carried on. Inſtead of wandring through a ſtorm in the dark, with ſo ſacred a charge in our cuſtody—I thought it would have been better to have waited, 'till the tempeſt was a little abated—or, at leaſt, to have procured ſome <hi>light</hi> to guide us through the ſurrounding dangers.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now conſider the <hi>manner</hi> in which the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent attempt to change our government is made.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway</hi> makes this general objection with great warmth to my arguments, "that they are conjectural and ſuppoſitious."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His</hi> reſentment was to be expected. How abſurd muſt the language of <hi>diffidence</hi> appear to one, who never doubted—the force of his own ſagacity? To one who, caſtigated, but not convinced, by a diſcovery of his <hi>repeated errors,</hi> ſtill dares to decide poſitively in things he does not underſtand—and drives boldly through <hi>public affairs,</hi> like a <hi>magnanimous bug,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">"Yet let me flap this <hi>bug</hi> with <hi>mealy wings."</hi> 
                  <bibl>POPE.</bibl>
               </note> through the blaze that has ſo often ſcorcht its wings—how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in <hi>his</hi> eyes, muſt be the man, who modeſtly
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009640_0020_0F77394DD76263A0"/>
purſues a train of enquiry, on the unformed events of futurity—and in his reſearches after truth, admits a poſſibility of her eſcaping him?</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway,</hi> with a ſpirit of divination, <hi>unaſſiſted by the common modes of reaſoning</hi>—penetrates into the region of <hi>contingencies</hi>—and fixes with <hi>infallible confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> the <hi>uncertainties</hi> of the times to come.—Far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent was the method, which the humble ſubject of his wrath and reproaches found it proper to purſue. Filled with anxious fears for the welfare of his country—<hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitating and apprehenſive,</hi>—it was his endeavour to form a <note n="‡" place="bottom">IT is ſomewhat remarkable, that Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> ſhould with anger make an objection to my arguments, that muſt in the opinion of every perſon but himſelf, operate with equal force againſt his own. Are not his arguments "conjectural and ſuppoſitious?" What proof is there, that any thing will be determined, according to his preſumptions and gueſſes?</note> judgment of things that may <hi>hereafter</hi> happen, from an attentive conſideration of <hi>preſent circumſtances</hi> and <hi>paſt tranſactions</hi>—the only methods to be practiſed by thoſe whoſe diſquiſitions are not aided by ſuch "<note n="*" place="bottom">Pretended ſpeech, pa. 44.</note> active blood" as Mr. <hi>Galloway's;</hi> to whom heſitation appears ridiculous, and apprehenſion abſurd! And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der—for if any miſtake is committed, all the injury that follows, is—only the trifling loſs of the PRIVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEGES OF PENNSYLVANIA.</p>
            <p>BUT though Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> pierces through <hi>futurity</hi> with ſuch ſuperior intuition, yet he is ſubject to a mere mortal frailty in conſidering <hi>preſent</hi> things. Hence he <hi>confounds</hi> thoſe arguments I uſed with reſpect to the <hi>manner</hi> of attempting a change of our government, with the arguments I offered concerning the <hi>time,</hi> and does not ſeem ſenſible of his miſtake.</p>
            <p>BY way of explanation and introduction to what I ſaid on the <hi>manner</hi> of this attempt, it was <hi>premiſed</hi>—that
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009640_0021_0F77394E85F04B50"/>
ſome event, ariſing from the circumſtances of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary family, or an act of the crown, might hereafter preſent us with a more <hi>happy method</hi> of vindicating our rights and privileges than the preſent. Upon this Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> very <hi>gravely</hi> runs into a calculation of the lives of the proprietors and their families—and proves <hi>to his own ſatisfaction,</hi> that their deſcendents <note n="†" place="bottom">Pretended ſpeech, pa. 15, line 18. "They and every of them" a ſtrong and beautiful expreſſion frequently occurring in <hi>Jacob's law dictionary,</hi> and in any book of <hi>precedents.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>"even they, and every of them"</hi> will always be wicked and cunning. One virtue however he muſt allow them, to take off the force of my obſervation—and that is—<hi>a moſt uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon harmony among themſelves.</hi> Yet, after ſpending four pages on this curious digreſſion, Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> himſelf muſt grant—that ſome <hi>act</hi> of the crown, or a <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of proprietors (as it happened in <hi>Carolina)</hi> or a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention</hi> between them tho' few, will be ſuch a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as will produce the conjuncture I mentioned. But I will waive theſe probabilities. I will indulge Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> ſo far as to ſuppoſe, they are too uncertain or remote to be expected or regarded. What will this conceſſion prove? That none of thoſe occurrences will afford a favourable mode of making the attempt. But does it prove the preſent mode to be a good one? or that any neceſſity is ſo urgent as to force us, to make uſe of it, tho' a bad one. By no means! If I ſhould ſee a man about to paſs a broad, deep <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pretended ſpeech, pa. 14.</note> river, over which I had reaſon to think he could not ſwim, would it be an unwiſe or an unkind act in me, to adviſe him to walk along the bank, and endeavour to find a bridge, or a narrower or ſhallower place—tho' I had no certainty that there was ſuch a bridge or ſuch a place? Or would this be acknowledging that he was under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of paſſing the river? My advice would at leaſt have a <hi>chance</hi> of ſaving him, and could do him no harm—for, after being diſappointed in his ſearch, he might return to the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:009640_0022_0F77395097E873F0"/>
ſpot where I found him—and <hi>would be at liberty to drown himſelf at laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway</hi> mixes all points ſo confuſedly together, that he not only leads himſelf into a variety of errors, but renders it very difficult for another, in anſwering, to reduce into any order what he has ſo looſely ſcattered about. This I ſhall however endeavour to do.</p>
            <p>HAD he attended to the objections againſt the <hi>manner</hi> of the preſent attempt, he might have perceived that they were <hi>three.</hi> The firſt was—that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending this proceeding, might cauſe others to attribute it to ſuch paſſions, as are always diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to public councils, and deſtructive to the honor and welfare of a people. It certainly will be admitted, that all reproaches or this kind ought to be carefully guarded againſt—eſpecially by a <hi>dependent colony,</hi> whoſe conduct has been frequently and ſeverely reprehended.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway</hi> however uſurps in his private room, among his chairs and tables, the <hi>abſurd licence</hi> of railing at me on this occaſion, for ſpeaking my ſentiments with freedom—tho' I ſpoke in a public council—as the repreſentative of a free people—on a ſubject in which their reputation and happineſs were intimately concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Any man who thinks, will inſtantly perceive— that it was my <hi>duty</hi> to mention every thing, that I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended would tend to ſecure theſe bleſſings. When the aſſembly was deliberating on a ſtep that ſeemed to me likely to bring diſcredit and loſs upon us, would it have become me to have ſuppreſſed my opinion? No! But it would have pleaſed Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers —</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great reward for having been a villain!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I SAID—<q>Our meſſages to the governor, and our reſolves would diſcover the <hi>true cauſe</hi> of the preſent,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009640_0023_0F77395155057C28"/>
attempt</q>—Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> grants it; and appeals to, thoſe reſolves for my confuſion. How is this charge ſupported? Why, the reſolves mention—"public houſes—commiſſions to judges during pleaſure— and the great danger of a military force in a proprietary government"—as grievances. In like manner they mention the point lately controverted. Very well! The <hi>contents</hi> of the reſolves are <hi>now proved.</hi>—But there ſtill remains one point ſlipped over in ſilence—<hi>Why</hi> were theſe reſolves <hi>now</hi> made? The increaſe of public houſes had frequently been complained of before.—Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions during good behaviour have always been wiſhed for.—The eſtabliſhment of a military force has been often attempted in the midſt of war, when it was vaſtly more neceſſary than at this time.—But never 'till <hi>now</hi> has there been an attempt to change the government. More obſervations I think unneceſſary. Impartial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who read the meſſages and reſolves—and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>ſome other circumſtances</hi> generally known—will be able to diſcover the TRUE CAUSE of the preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt—and to judge, whether it may be juſtly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to paſſion of <hi>any kind.</hi> It his majeſty and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, whoſe preſent opinion of us is allowed to be extremely unfavorable, ſhould be induced by our late behaviour, to think us a raſh, turbulent people—it will be a misfortune to be deplored by all lovers of their country.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond objection againſt the <hi>manner</hi> of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was the <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> in which we ſhould be involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This inconſiſtency is twofold. In the firſt place, our diſſention with the governor, and this extraordinary attempt in conſequence of it, may be thought by the king and the miniſtry to have ariſen on a matter already determined by the crown. Hence our <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> to comply with the <hi>royal pleaſure,</hi> ſignifyed to us on this head, may be called <hi>a very improper foundation</hi> of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<q>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:009640_0024_0F773951B23AC3C0"/>
to be more immediately ſubjected to the royal pleaſure.</q> But this objection is eaſily obviated by <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> that the king and miniſtry will exactly agree with the aſſembly in conſtruing the controverted ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. I ſincerely hope they may; as our conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears to me extremely reaſonable and equitable. But, of this agreement in ſentiments I deſired to have ſome proof before we proceeded any further. We have frequently been diſappointed in our warmeſt expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In public as well as in private life, he that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doubts, will often be wrong.</p>
            <p>IN the ſecond place—there appeared to me an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency,</hi> in requeſting a change of government from the king—and yet inſiſting on the preſervation of privileges derogatory of the royal rights.</p>
            <p>WE certainly prefer in our minds one of theſe things to the other.—Either to continue as we are—or to change, tho' we loſe our privileges. If his majeſty will not accept of the government in the ſame ſtate, in which it has been held by the proprietors, what ſhall be our choice? I don't imagine, that even Mr. <hi>Galloway,</hi> tho' he ventures to ſay "<note n="*" place="bottom">Pretended Speech pa. 21.</note> We have no cauſe to dread a change if all "my fears ſhould prove realities," will dare to propoſe a direct renunciation of our rights. Trifling as <hi>he</hi> ſeems to think them—willing as <hi>he</hi> is to expoſe them to hazard on gueſſes and ſurmiſes— they are yet held in too much veneration by the good people of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi>—for him to <hi>declare</hi> his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> of them. If then his majeſty ſhall be ſo <hi>"unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable"</hi> as to inſiſt upon exerciſing his authority, in caſe of a change, as fully in this province, as in any other under his immediate government—and we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt that he ſhall not; the bargain breaks off—"and the worſt conſequence is (according to Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi>)
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:009640_0025_0F7739524E0D2330"/>
that we muſt then remain (as I would have us remain) in our preſent ſituation." A much worſe conſequence in my opinion will follow. May we not <hi>again</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached with <hi>double dealing</hi> and <hi>deceit?</hi>—The aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly's petition to the crown draws a high coloured pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our preſent diſtreſſes.—But let me ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> deputed to plead the public cauſe—an office which I have ſome reaſon to think, would, by no means, be diſagreeable to him!—<q>

            <p>THUS, <hi>by requeſting a change,</hi> we lay ourſelves under the inevitable neceſſity, either of quietly giving up our rights and privileges, in order to maintain a <hi>conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi> in our conduct; or, of incurring the ſevere cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure above mentioned—unleſs the king will be ſo <hi>good natur'd,</hi> in conſideration of the <hi>infinite pains</hi> we have taken to recommend ourſelves to his favor—as to be contented with the <hi>ſame ſhare of power</hi> in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; which his two ſubjects <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Richard Penn</hi> now have.</p>
            <p>MY third objection againſt the <hi>manner</hi> of the preſent attempt to alter our government was—<q>that it might be deemed in <hi>Great Britain</hi> a ſurrender of our charter—or at leaſt a ſufficient foundation for the parliament's proceeding to form a new conſtitution for us.</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:009640_0028_0F7739548AE14740"/>NO perſon can <hi>ſurrender</hi> what he has not. This term, therefore, when applied to the people of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> means a giving up of the peculiar rights deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>them,</hi> under their charter.</p>
            <p>THEY can not ſurrender what belongs to others— and therefore <hi>their</hi> act can not take away the rights of the proprietors. But ſhould the proprietors, enraged at our behaviour, and fatigued with diſputes, make their own terms with the crown, and give up the royal charter—then the <hi>ſurrender</hi> may be ſaid to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway</hi> ſays,—the petitions can not be thought in any manner to ſurrender our privileges— becauſe "they <hi>request</hi> the enjoyment of thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges." But, if it be conſidered, that to procure peace and ſafety, is the deſign of forming ſocieties, and of eſtabliſhing governments—and that theſe petitions expreſly declare—<note n="†" place="bottom">Pretended ſpeech pa. 18, 36, et alibi.</note> 
               <q>there is no peace and ſafety among us, and that we have no hopes of either being reſtored but by the change for which we pray.</q>—Certainly, if we are thought to be in our ſenſes, it will be concluded that we intend to <hi>ſurrender intirely</hi> a government, which does not anſwer the ends of government—even tho' we ſhould be deprived of <hi>ſome agreeable things</hi> tacked to it.—For who but a <hi>Bedlamite</hi> would ſhiver in a thin ſilk coat, in the midſt of winter, only becauſe it had a fine lace upon it?—</p>
            <p>IT may ſeem therefore a reaſonable conſtruction of theſe petitions to underſtand them in this ſenſe— "that the petitioners will be much obliged to his majeſty, if he will be ſo good as to put the lace on warmer coats for them—but, if he will not condeſcend to do that, he may keep the lace for his trouble—provided he will furniſh them with coats of good <hi>Engliſh broad cloth."</hi>

I will not purſue this point any farther. I will ſuppoſe in Mr. <hi>Galloway's</hi> favour, that what he calls his ſpeech was ſo long, and took ſo much time in making, that he forgot in forming one part; what he had written in another.</p>

            </p>
            <p>THUS he concludes, that becauſe the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons would not make the king <hi>abſolute monarch</hi> of <hi>North-America,</hi> which would have been injurious to the rights of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>—THEREFORE they will not allow him to exerciſe in <hi>one province</hi> that authority, which he exerciſes in every other part of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.—<hi>Truly,</hi> an uncommon, but not a very ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſtical method, of arguing!</p>

            <p>WHEN he has made a <hi>ſpeech</hi> for this purpoſe, ſuppoſe ſome unconverted member ſhould thus addreſs him— "Sir, we are perfectly ſatisfied in <hi>what rank</hi> we are to place your abilities—the <hi>"proofs are irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble"</hi>—but as to the point you have inſiſted on, you do not ſeem to expreſs yourſelf <hi>with clearneſs.</hi> You ſpeak of an <hi>"impelling neceſſity</hi> to come under the king's immediate government,"—and yet you ſay it will be "unjuſt to bring you under it, on the ſame conditions with his other ſubjects."

            <p>IF it <hi>cannot</hi> be accompliſhed—the <hi>manner</hi> in which it has been attempted will load this province with new diſgrace.

            <p>
               <hi>HERE</hi> then I fix the argument. On <hi>this point</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Whatſoever may be the force of the reaſonings on either ſide—however probable or improbable the ſucceſs may be—yet after placing every thing in the ſtrongeſt light againſt myſelf—<hi>it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>—that the event is <hi>undoubtedly uncertain</hi>—and that the perſons deſiring a change know <hi>no more,</hi> what

will be the conſequences—than they know what will be the figure of next year's clouds.</p>
            <p>A MEASURE in which the happineſs of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands is involved, ought not therefore to have been pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued in ſo haſty and unguarded a manner. <hi>Precautions</hi> ſhould have been taken. <hi>Securities</hi> ſhould have been obtained.

            <p>I PROCEED to other points. Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> takes great pains to prove, that the <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>IN the <hi>ſame ſtriking method</hi> of arguing, he attempts to prove—<hi>that</hi> the petition for a change ought not to alarm a free people, <hi>becauſe,</hi> "though it calls for a military eſtabliſhment among us," yet this is only ſhewing our deſire, that a military force <hi>may</hi> be fixed, which, "already <hi>is</hi> fixed:" Or in other words, "it is only diſcovering our <hi>hearty approbation</hi> of a <hi>diſagreeable meaſure"—that</hi> "<note n="†" place="bottom">Pretended ſpeech pa. 40. line 7, 8.</note> a military <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> is already <hi>eſtabliſhed"</hi> (to uſe his own words) <hi>becauſe</hi> there are <hi>ſome ſoldiers</hi> in garriſon at our advanced forts—for <hi>theſe</hi> he certainly means by the "military eſtabliſhment already eſtabliſhed," or nothing—<hi>that</hi> a military force in a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant colony,</hi> lodged in the hands of the <hi>king,</hi> is <hi>leſs dangerous</hi> to liberty, than in the hands of a <hi>ſubject—that</hi> it is the ſtrongeſt evidence of the <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>public ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>ſuch a colony,</hi> to repreſent themſelves as a ſett of <hi>ruffians</hi> amongſt whom there is no ſafety for men of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor any reſpect for government, but all things are involved in <hi>anarchy</hi>—and therefore humbly to

pray, that his majeſty will be pleaſed to ſend over ſome regiments to inſtruct them in the <hi>gentle leſſons</hi> of <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>obedience—that</hi> this will not furniſh a pretence to ſend over <hi>more regiments,</hi> than are deſired—nor to make us <hi>pay</hi> for theſe bleſſings <hi>of ſwords and bayonets,</hi> which we have <hi>requeſted</hi>—or if theſe inconveniences ſhould follow,—<hi>that</hi> they will be greatly overballanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the advantages of the civil war that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably enſue, if theſe troops ſhould be employed, as Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> would wiſh them to be.</p>
            <p>THESE are his arguments, and the tendency of them, on theſe points. Arguments!—Yielding ſuch ample room for the entertainment of the public, that I hope ſome gentleman who has more leiſure than I have, will divert the world with the ſtrictures upon them they deſerve.

            <p>THE firſt of theſe, is, "that my late conduct has been influenced by a reſtleſs thirſt after promotion; a fondneſs to ſerve the purpoſes of power, from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of being rewarded with poſts of honour and profit."</p>

                     <q>Having determin'd to be guided <hi>by no other principle</hi> in my tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the <hi>aſſembly,</hi> I thought I could not too carefully avoid all appearances of affectation or diſguiſe in my conduct; that thoſe who were influenced by an <hi>imprudent zeal,</hi> or actuated by a <hi>ſpirit of cabal,</hi> might have no hopes of <hi>gaining</hi> or <hi>ſeducing</hi> me: Therefore from the beginning, I ſhewed myſelf ſolicitous to ſupport on this occaſion, THAT CHARACTER by which the <hi>public</hi> was to know <hi>how I would act on every other;</hi> that is, of a man ſincerely attached to the <hi>true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and intereſt</hi> of the <hi>proteſtant religion,</hi> yet incapable of drawing the <hi>falſe conſequences</hi> which many of the proteſtants did, or of approving their <hi>irregular proceedings:</hi> The <hi>ſpeech</hi> I made at the opening of the <hi>aſſembly,</hi> which laſted <hi>half an hour,</hi> was wholly <hi>calculated</hi> to produce <hi>this effect,</hi> without troubling myſelf to conſider, whether it would give pleaſure or offence to the greateſt number.</q>

               </note> ſince it is highly improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009640_0038_0F77395E5C760A90"/>
               <hi>that any man will be long eſteemed by a party, unleſs he is bound to it by</hi> PREJUDICES, <hi>as well as by</hi> PRINCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLES.</p>
            <p>TO ſupport the attrocious charge he has made againſt me, Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> produces no kind of proof—except my differing in opinion from him, be proof. But if this be admitted, then Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> Mr. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> and the two other gentlemen who differed from him, are villains alſo, influenced by the ſame views, attributed to me.</p>
            <p>THIS would be too daring a charge, and more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult perhaps for Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> to ſupport, than to cruſh by <hi>calumnies</hi> and <hi>conſpiracies,</hi> a young man, who has excited more than one paſſion in more than one man's breaſt.</p>
            <p>HAD I intended to recommend myſelf to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I certainly might have given the ſentiments I
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009640_0039_0F77395FD2BAF7B8"/>
delivered in the Houſe, a more courtier-like air than they now bear. Had I intended this, I ſhould not have been one of the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>warmeſt</hi> to declare my <hi>fixed reſolution,</hi> not to admit of the governor's conſtruction of the ſtipulation he diſputed with us; nor ſhould I have ſteadily perſiſted in this oppoſition <hi>to the laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAD I intended this, I ſhould not have been the <hi>only man</hi> in the Houſe, who <hi>conſtantly refuſed</hi> to aſſent to the ſupply bill, <hi>becauſe</hi> the money emitted by it, was made a legal tender in payment of all demands "except proprietary rents,"—when <hi>that exception</hi> might have been ſafely extended (as was granted by the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed members) to the <hi>rents of all other perſons</hi>— who would then have been <hi>as well</hi> ſecured as the proprietors, and a diſtinction in their favour alone, avoided.</p>
            <p>ONE thing more I beg leave to mention, ſince Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> compels me to ſpeak of myſelf. I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to carry the bill to the governor the ſecond time for his aſſent, after he had once refuſed it. This was long before the change of government was talked of. On my delivering it, ſome converſation aroſe between us on the ſubject, Mr. <hi>Shippen</hi> the ſecretary being preſent. As the paſſage of the bill was of the utmoſt importance to his majeſty's ſervice, and the good of the public, I took the liberty, though my acquaintance with the governor was very ſlight, of mentioning ſeveral reaſons to prove, that the aſſembly's conſtruction of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted ſtipulation was extremely equitable; conſiſtent with the eſtabliſhed rules of explaining a ſentence capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of two meanings; and therefore ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted—and that his honour's conduct in paſſing the bill, as it then was framed, would not be diſapproved of in <hi>England.</hi> I further added, that I was perſwaded, his refuſal would throw every thing into the greateſt confuſion</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:009640_0040_0F7739608727D920"/>BEING ſoon after taken ill, and confined to my room, ſo anxious was I to prevent any difference at that time between the governor and aſſembly, that I ſent for a gentleman, whom I knew to be intimately acquainted with the governor; and urging every thing I could think of, to convince him that our bill ought to be paſſed as we had formed it, I intreated him to go to the governor, and endeavour to prevail on him to give his aſſent.</p>
            <p>I HOPE <hi>this</hi> cannot be called the conduct of a man influenced by "miſchievous paſſions deſtructive of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic liberty."</p>
            <p>ANOTHER charge brought againſt me by Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> is, that I neglected my duty of attending in the Houſe, and never ſpoke my ſentiments till it was too late.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway</hi>'s behaviour in making this charge, is a plain proof <hi>to what lengths</hi> he will proceed, in hopes of injuring <hi>me.</hi> The firſt time, ſince I have been a repreſentative of this province, that a change of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was mentioned and debated in the aſſembly, was on Saturday the 24th day of March laſt, on the governor's ſending down to them his meſſage abſolutely refuſing to paſs the ſupply bill, unleſs the ſtipulation was literally complied with. <hi>That day,</hi> the aſſembly's anſwer was compoſed and ſent—"the frequent motions, with the ſolemn debate" Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> talks of, made—the reſolves paſt—and the Houſe adjourned to the 14th of May.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway muſt be conſcious,</hi> that this day, and the day before, I was confined to my chamber, and moſtly to my bed, by a ſevere attack of the fever and ague. He knows, that on the <hi>Thurſday</hi> before, I was ſo ill, that there not being a ſufficient number of members
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:009640_0041_0F773961EE28BDF0"/>
without <hi>me,</hi> thoſe who were met, intended to come and ſit at my houſe; and that to ſave the gentlemen this trouble, I determined to wait on <hi>them,</hi> and was carried up in the late ſpeaker's chariot, which he was ſo kind as to ſend for me, it being a rainy day.</p>
            <p>THIS ſtate of my health at that time, being a fact well known to many perſons, and particularly to Mr. <hi>Galloway,</hi> how <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>unjuſt</hi> is it to blame me for not attending, when it was impoſſible— and when, if it had been poſſible, <hi>I had not the leaſt ſuſpicion,</hi> that any thing of ſuch vaſt importance would come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>ON the meeting of the Houſe, the 14th day of laſt <hi>May,</hi> according to their adjournment, I conſtantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>every day,</hi> untill this important matter was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, except on <hi>Monday</hi> the 21ſt—on which day there was no Houſe, only eighteen members meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> and many others being abſent. The following days, the petition for a change came in— were read—as other petitions were—lay on the table—and not a word ſpoken on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> buſineſs went on till <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 23d, when I was prevented <hi>for the firſt time</hi> from attending the Houſe, by a fever—which, as it was very injurious to my health, would alſo, if Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi>'s charitable and humane wiſhes could prevail, prove deſtructive to my reputation. <hi>This day</hi> the matter was <hi>ſtarted. In vain</hi> did the ſpeaker recommend the deferring to take any reſolution, till the Houſe was more full—and the abſent members <hi>then in town,</hi> could attend—He deſired that the affair might be put off <hi>to the next day— in vain</hi>—the debate was begun—quickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined —a committee appointed to prepare a draught of the petition—that draught made— brought in—preſented—read—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:009640_0042_0F7739626617D0D8"/>THE next day, tho' ſtill extremely indiſpoſed, I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended—and was ſurpriſed to find ſo much buſineſs <hi>of the utmoſt conſequence</hi> had been done in ſo ſhort a time—and though I could have wiſhed that <hi>ſuch a ſtep</hi> had not been taken, without allowing me, and every other member, <hi>of whoſe attendance there was any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> an opportunity of offering our ſentiments; yet I comforted myſelf with reflecting, that though it had been reſolved, "that a petition ſhould be drawn," yet it was not reſolved "that any petition ſhould be preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed," and that I ſhould be at liberty to offer my opinion hereafter. I was determined therefore to attend dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; and to take the <hi>firſt opportunity,</hi> which would be on the ſecond reading of the petition, to oppoſe it. This I was induced to do, by conſidering, that if I did not ſay any thing, till the queſtion was put for <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing,</hi> or <hi>ſigning</hi> in order to be preſented, it would look very odd for me to be ſilent ſo long, and that it would anſwer no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, on the ſecond reading of the petition, which was the <hi>firſt opportunity I ever had,</hi> ſince the change of government was attempted, I ſpoke againſt it.</p>
            <p>THE only objection <hi>then</hi> made by Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> and every other member who ſpoke on the occaſion, was—that I had offered my ſentiments <hi>too ſoon</hi> to the Houſe—and that I ſhould have <hi>ſtaid</hi> for the queſtion to <hi>tranſcribe</hi> or <hi>ſign</hi> the petition.</p>
            <p>THAT I did not act with any ſtupid and uſeleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in lying by till this time, was never dreamt of by any member who knew, <hi>why</hi> I had been detained at home, whenever I <hi>was</hi> detained.</p>
            <p>HOW vain is his attempt who ſtrives to pleaſe <hi>all men?</hi> Or indeed to pleaſe one man at <hi>all times?</hi> Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:009640_0043_0F773962C8CEA768"/>
and others <hi>then</hi> ſaid, that I ſpoke <hi>too ſoon.</hi> He and ſome more <hi>now</hi> ſay, I ſpoke <hi>too late.</hi> Why too late? Were not my arguments as well underſtood <hi>then,</hi> and had they not the <hi>ſame force,</hi> as if they had been uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? And if they proved the meaſure to be <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>improper,</hi> ought they not <hi>in a matter of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the public,</hi> to have been as much regarded, as if they were <hi>one day older?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF this affair had not been <hi>ſo quickly decided,</hi> I never ſhould have been charged with omitting to ſpeak in time. But I muſt not quit Mr. <hi>Galloway.</hi> What muſt the public think of a man who dares to abuſe them by the groſſeſt deceptions, with the pious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of injuring another? He ſays "that during the time of the <hi>ſeveral debates</hi> reſpecting the change of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I <hi>ſeldom</hi> attended, and was abſent when the important one came on, which iſſued in the reſolve, to adjourn and conſult the people."</p>
            <p>YET the candid Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> knows—that there never was any debate in the aſſembly, ſince I have been a member, reſpecting the change of government— untill that which iſſued in the reſolve to adjourn— and <hi>that I was then ill.</hi> Again, he ſays, "at the next meeting, (meaning that in <hi>May) ſeveral motions</hi> were made to bring this reſolution to an iſſue, and after <hi>great deliberation,</hi> it was reſolved by a majority of 27 to 3, that a committee ſhould be appointed to bring in the petition to his majeſty to reſume the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.—But at none of theſe debates and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was I preſent, tho' I well <hi>knew,</hi> or at leaſt had great reaſon to <hi>expect this buſineſs was in continual agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YET the correct Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> knows, that there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was a motion—or debate—or reſolution, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009640_0044_0F77396386DF5A88"/>
this matter, upon the meeting of the houſe in <hi>May</hi>— untill <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 23d day of the month, when I was taken ſick, as has been mentioned—and that <hi>I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as diligently as himſelf till that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Account of the time when every tranſaction paſſed in the houſe—and of my attendance, is taken from the <hi>minutes</hi> of aſſembly, and the <hi>book</hi> for entring the attendance of the members—both which I have carefully looked over, in the preſence of Dr. <hi>Moore,</hi> the clerk, who therefore is perfectly acquainted with the truth of every thing I have averred.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER charge againſt me is, that "I formed my thoughts into order, and reduced what I had to ſay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to writing, in an <hi>unparliamentary</hi> way."</p>
            <p>I ACKNOWLEDGE myſelf guilty of taking ſome pains to put my thoughts into order, and that my notes were long and exact, that I might thereby be enabled to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver my ſentiments with clearneſs. I regarded this as a duty, upon an occaſion where ſuch an intereſting ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was to be diſcuſſed—and I was <hi>encouraged</hi> to uſe <hi>this mode</hi>—becauſe I once before had uſed it, and received ſuch <hi>public praiſes</hi> from the preſent ſpeaker, for introducing a method, highly commended, and the next day, imitated by him, as afforded me the ſincereſt pleaſure—and I hope, will "<note n="*" place="bottom">Preface to pretended ſpeech—pa. 25. <q>I would only adviſe him carefully to preſerve the panegyricks with which" the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary faction "have adorned him: In time, they may <hi>ſerve to conſole him, by balancing the calumny they ſhall load him with, when he does not go</hi> THROUGH <hi>with them in all their meaſures:</hi> He will not probably do the one, and they will then aſſuredly do the other.—There are mouths that can blow hot as well as cold, and blaſt on your <hi>brows</hi> the bays their hands have placed there.—<hi>Experto crede Roberto.</hi> Let but the <hi>moon</hi> of proprietary favour <hi>withdraw</hi> its <hi>ſhine</hi> for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that great number of the principal gentlemen of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia</hi> who applied to you for a copy of your ſpeech, ſhall immediately deſpiſe and deſert you.</q>—</note> ſerve to conſole

            </p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway</hi> alſo accuſes me of having promiſed him a copy of my ſpeech, and of not performing my promiſe. Here he is egregiouſly miſtaken. I told him he ſhould have the copy that night it was delivered, <hi>if I could get it ready.</hi> The houſe broke up late in the evening. He ſoon after called upon me. It was not ready. He told me it would be <hi>too late,</hi> if he had it not ſoon. I did not then underſtand <hi>his meaning,</hi> as I did not in the leaſt apprehend, the moſt important matter that ever came before the houſe of aſſembly, was to be decided with leſs deliberation than is generally beſtowed on things of much ſlighter moment. Next morning I took the copy to the Houſe in my pocket. No one called for it. I did the ſame in the afternoon. The like ſilence was obſerved. I did not chuſe to ſhew any forwardneſs in forcing it on thoſe, who ſeemed willing to forget it. Had I acted other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I ſhould have been called impudent and conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by thoſe who are fond of beſtowing epithets.</p>
            <p>MR. <hi>Galloway</hi> ſays, "that I attempted to deliver my objections againſt the meaſure <hi>ore tenus;</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing I offered judiciouſly and ſenſibly refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeveral members, I was obliged to retreat to my
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009640_0046_0F773965F8716AC8"/>
ſpeech in writing, which after a ſhort introductory apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, I read in a manner, not the moſt deliberate."</p>
            <p>AS to the laſt part of this whimſical charge, I ſhall not pretend to give any anſwer; becauſe that would be in ſome meaſure allowing Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> capable of judging, what is a "deliberate manner" of ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>AS to the firſt part—any man but Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> would have diſcovered <hi>why</hi> I began to ſpeak, without recurring to my notes. The reſolves were paſt— and the petition ordered to be drawn in my abſence. I never had heard the change ſpoke of in the houſe— and did not know but by information of others, the reaſons by which the members had been influenced. Before I offered my ſentiments, it was therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for me to diſcover the arguments that would be uſed againſt me. On the information I had received, I had prepared my anſwer; but to make this anſwer appear with propriety, I thought it requiſite to have the arguments of thoſe who deſired a change, repeated before the houſe. I threw out general objections, and deſired to know what reaſons could be tho't ſufficient to engage the houſe in ſo hazardous a meaſure? Then the "judicious and ſenſible members" Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> mentions, and he among them—for that phraſe I ſuppoſe, is his way of complimenting himſelf—diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all the arguments on which they relied.—They proved to be the ſame I expected; and I "retreated to my ſpeech," which was prepared to anſwer them.</p>
            <p>THE laſt objection made by Mr. <hi>Galloway,</hi> of which I ſhall take notice, is, "that the ſpeech, as printed, is different from that delivered—and that the preface ſufficiently <hi>demoſtrates,</hi> by whoſe hands it has been dreſt up, and with what views it has been publiſhed."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:009640_0047_0F773966D59763B8"/>HERE he is again miſtaken. The printed ſpeech is exactly the ſame with that I pronounced, except the corrections, and additions I made to compleat the ſenſe, the evening before it was to be delivered to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as is above mentioned—and except ſome ſlight alterations in a few places. <hi>I further declare,</hi> that I have not received the leaſt aſſiſtance from any perſon, in compoſing or correcting it; not even ſo much as the addition of a ſingle word; and that no man ever ſaw it, or knew that I had written it, except my clerk, who tranſcribed it—untill it was delivered in the Houſe.</p>
            <p>AS to the preface, it makes no <hi>"demonſtrations"</hi> that can affect <hi>me.</hi> Finding that Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> and his emiſſaries were traducing me in every company, and miſrepreſenting every thing I had ſaid—I thought theſe aſperſions might be removed, by laying before the public, the reaſons by which I had been induced to act as I did. This conſideration had the more weight with me, on receiving a letter from ſome gentlemen in this city, deſiring a copy of the ſpeech.</p>
            <p>THEY being my conſtituents—and men of the cleareſt characters, I thought it my duty to comply with their requeſt. I ſent a copy to them—and they had it printed with ſuch a title, and in ſuch a manner, as they thought proper, <hi>without ever conſulting me;</hi> which could not conveniently be done as I was out of town.—For immediately after delivering the copy, I was obliged to go into the country for my health. I went to the <hi>Jerſeys.</hi> While I was there, the preface was written, and printed. I never ſaw it.—I never was made acquainted with its contents, till it was publiſhed. I do not even know at this time who wrote it, but by common report.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:009640_0048_0F77396751F0C600"/>EVERY thing I have ſaid on theſe laſt heads, is known to be true, by my friends; whoſe virtue and good opinion I too much revere, to appeal to them as witneſſes, if I was not conſcious of the <hi>ſincerity</hi> with which I ſpeak.</p>
            <p>THUS have I <hi>faithfully</hi> laid before the public, my whole conduct relating to the change of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the reaſons on which it was founded. If ſenſible and good men approve of my behaviour, I quit without regret the applauſes of others, and all the attendant advantages, to thoſe, who think proper to court them.</p>

            <p>WEAKNESS and ignorance when attended by modeſty, are naturally entitled to pardon and to pity.

               <hi>no longer capable</hi> of ſtruggling for relief."—Surely this <hi>human conſtitution,</hi> whoſe "<hi>vital motion</hi> as well as its <hi>powers of life</hi> are nearly deſtroyed" is now <hi>ſick enough</hi> for any ſimile in the world—</p>
            <p>"IS not this the time to apply the remedy? No! For it ſhould have been applied before—and now nature is ſo much exhauſted, may "entirely deſtroy" her—which frequently happens, when people will venture to take phyſick from <hi>"quacks";</hi> who are a ſort of gentry, never remarkable, before Mr. <hi>Galloway</hi> made the diſcovery, "for <hi>waiting</hi> in hopes of ſome lucky criſis"—NOW OR NEVER, is a motto, that ſuits <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empirics.</hi>—</p>

            <p>PERHAPS the author of this famous ſimile may ſay, that by the, "vital parts" he means the power of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature, and the adminiſtration of juſtice—But this will be a contradiction of himſelf, for he only allows "an <hi>upright</hi> adminiſtration of juſtice" to be a <hi>vital part;</hi> and as among us, "the ſtream of juſtice is become ſo <hi>turbid</hi> and <hi>thick,</hi> that it <hi>can no longer diſcharge its duty,"</hi> this "vital part" compoſed of "an upright admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration," is wanting.</p>
