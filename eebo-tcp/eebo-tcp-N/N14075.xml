            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>EPISTLE To all ſuch Readers as are not ſo far poſſeſſed by the ſtupifying Doctrine, of SALTATION FOR ALL MEN, as to be quite inſenſible of the Nature and Importance of SCRIPTURAL EVIDENCE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following Tract, has lately ſeen an anonymous pamphlet, entitled, SALVATION FOR ALL MEN. In which, though the author kept himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the curtain, he ventured to name ſeveral of his favorite authors, and of them he gives great aſſurance to the public, that they were ſkilful demagogues, and worthy of undoubted confidence. And we muſt be very ſceptical if we don't conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this publiſher, as their cordial devotee. He had alſo ſeen a ſerious anſwer to that nameleſs pamphlet, done by the vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Dr. Mather. Alſo a printed letter to the doctor, in which the author appears to diſplay HIMSELF. The author of this piece has alſo been favored with another reply to the above nameleſs pamphlet; ſtiled THE DOCTRINE OF FUTURE PUNISHMENT ILLUSTRATED. And was agreeably ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated by its kind, but juſt reproof of "ſinful latitude, and ſpiritual ſleep." p. 4. Preface addreſſed to all who ſee groſs attacks made on the revealed ſyſtem, profeſs honor for it, and yet with MEROZ of old, come no forth to the help of the Lord, againſt the mighty. For though nothing great, has been exhibited in the laſt attack, except the unbelief, and daring front, which it indicates. Yet as all oppoſition to the bible, is patronized by the prince of darkneſs; ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all who diſavow his dominion, to take the alarm, and beat to arms. The leaders of this attack boaſt of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity; yet they ſeem cautious of the true original, which we have from authority quite indiſputable. Gen. iii. 4, in theſe words "ye ſhall not ſurely die." They boaſt alſo of the number and importance of their abettors; but they do not care to ſpeak out, and ſay "our name is Legion." And yet all who tremble at the word of the Lord, conſider them as acting the legionary part, and executing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that early deluſion: no, no, "ye ſhall not ſurely die." But all may be admoniſhed, that this flattery, is not leſs malignent, for making its appearance again, at ſo late a period: nor its circumvention, leſs certain; or its tragical tendency leſs tremendous in its nature, than at firſt. But the reigning Lord of the world, has pleged himſelf "to bruiſe the ſerpents head. And he never ſuffers this firſt oppoſer
<pb n="IV" facs="unknown:017812_0004_0FA31B14C2DBDB78"/>
of his deſigns, and corruptor of his truth to prevail, any farther than he both knows how, and is inflexibly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, to terminate in the accompliſhment of his purpoſe. For in defiance of all oppoſition, "he will do all his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and nothing ſhall ſtay his hand." Yea, though "the enemy come in like a flood," he will lift up a hundred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. Iſaia lix. 19. This therefore gives ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to all who tremble for the ark of God, at this day. He knew the council of the Syrians in their bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. He heard the reproachful words of SENACHERIB, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the living God. And he dares all oppoſition ſtill, when he ſays "aſſociate yourſelves, O ye people, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: gird yourſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces; gird yourſelves, and ye ſhall be broken in pieces. Take council, and it ſhall come to nought; ſpeak the word, and it ſhall not ſtand: for God is with us." Iſaia viii. 9, 10. Now all theſe things are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are to come. I. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e are mighty ſwaſives to induce all, who with purpoſe of heart chuſe to ſerve the Lord, and to whom his word is precious, to attend to it, confide in it, and do it unuſual honors, in this day of rebuke and blaſphemy: viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the words of many in MALACHI's time, were ſtout againſt the Lord: and they ſtood upon their vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſiſting on it, that they have reaſon to alledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt divine ordinations; and counted the proud who did ſo, the happy men; and even celebrated and extolled thoſe who boldly wrought wickedneſs, and tempted God. Mal. iii. 13, 14, 15. Even then, thoſe who feared the Lord, did openly ſpeak, appear, and act in teſtimony for him. And it pleaſed the Lord, he hearkened and heard their teſtimonies, and kept a memorial thereof in their favour, in his book of remembrence. V. 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He will render to every man according to his deeds: ſo thoſe who by conſtant patience in doing good, exert themſelves in ſeeking the honor and glory of God, and in maintaining the honor of his holy word, he will render e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life. Which to all who contentiouſly oppoſe his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed nature and will, and ſo do not obey the truth; but actually obey righteousneſs, in reſpect to ſentiment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and practice, contrary to the eſtabliſhment of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="V" facs="unknown:017812_0005_0FA31B1583070A28"/>
word: to every ſoul of them "he will render indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh." Rom. ii. 6,—9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another motive on all ſuch as dearly love God's law, to eſpouſe its quarrel, in ſuch a day of inſult upon it, as we now behold is; there is a natural connection among he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies; one groſs war induces many: and when the flood gate is drawn, if it is not ſpeedily ſhut down, an inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may follow. The perfect connection and uniformity of the divine ſyſtem is ſuch, that an avowed oppoſition to one branch of it, infers a ſtrong neceſſity of denying all the reſt. Put <hi>nomo repente fit peſſimus.</hi> Heriticks don't arrive at their full growth ſuddenly. The ſhocking hereſy of this day, begun without any ſenſible deviation from the truth of God: viz. In avowing the grace of ſalvation, to be "free grace." Which is the doctrine of God. But the ringleader of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood always did, and always will employ his ſubtilty and power to ſuppreſs, or corrupt the purity of this doctrine; he well knew, if he could induce his omiſſaries to avow, and maintain the notion of ſalvation for all men, and put it to the account of "free grace;" it would be a corruption of that doctrine, and ſo ſtand to its final ſuppreſſion. Both as it muſt introduce various other errors, of the ſame ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency; and as its nature, being unſupportable from the ſcriptures, is to diſcredit, and ſo to extirpate that radical principle of Chriſtianity. The doctrine of free grace, in the juſtification, and ſalvation of ſinners, according to the bible, is the eye-ſore of hell, as well as the object of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to all wicked hearts. There is an aſſential difference between the free grace of the bible, and the univerſal grace, now proclaimed. The former ſuppoſeth moral ruin; the latter, human exiſtence. The former proceeds on the merit of attonement, according to the letter of the bible; the latter on ſuch as men pleaſe to aſſign for it. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer really makes new creatures; the latter has the word of men to make happy ones. The former is by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf reſtrained to the ſeed of ABRAHAM; the latter, in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the word of God, is extended to all the ſeed of fallen ADAM. The former powerfully cultivates the fear of God, and true holineſs; the latter evades both, and invites all licenciousneſs.</p>
            <p>Beſides, This doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, neceſſarily excludes that moſt merciful doctrine of gracious election; which is eſſentially neceſſary to the certainty of ſalvation for
<pb n="VI" facs="unknown:017812_0006_0FA31B16435DFFE0"/>
any at all. For if ſalvation is certain to any, it muſt be in conſequence of an unfruſtrable purpoſe in God. And this, to ſuch as cant deſerve it, muſt be the effect of mere grace. So that their ſalvation is wholly owing to election of grace. Rom. xi. 5. They are choſen in Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of his will. Eph. i. 3, 4, 5. Even the whole ſyſtem of the goſpel is founded in the doctrine of election by mere grace. But the notion of univerſal ſalvation, both excludes this doctrine; and therein the firſt principle of the chriſtian ſyſtem. And yet this is not all, for if elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is excluded, the abſolute ſovereignty of God is alſo excluded. And his claim to do what he will with his own, is alſo vacated. And of courſe, there is no certain monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his inflexible righteousneſs. On this occaſion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reader is deſired to attend carefully to the bible, on theſe points? and for his help, to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <div n="1" type="part">
               <head>The firſt PART.</head>
               <p>THE firſt pretended divine authority, which has of late been advanced in ſupport of the doctrine of ſalvation for all men, is, I. Tim. ii. 4. The words are "Who will have all men to be ſaved." The inſpired word here rendered ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is <hi>ſootbeenai,</hi> and is often rendered <hi>to be kept,</hi> or <hi>preſerved.</hi> It is uſed alſo, Matt. v. 23. to ſignify what JAIRUS wanted for his daughter, viz. to be healed, or preſerved from dying. It is uſed alſo Matt. xiv. 30. and it is rendered <hi>ſave,</hi> as in the text in queſtion; but every body knows what Peter meant by it, viz. "Lord preſerve me from drowning. Again it is uſed Mark v. 28. where alſo it is plain, the woman afflicted with her bloody iſſue meant, that ſhe ſhould be healed, that ſo her health and life might be preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The diſciples alſo uſed it, when chriſt told them LA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZARUS ſleepeth. They ſay then he will do well. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is a ſign he is recovering. And it is uſed ever in the ſame form, as is the text before us, viz. <hi>Sootheenai.</hi> Acts xiv. 9. Reſpecting the impotent man of LYSTRA, his having faith to be healed, i. e. reſtored to the uſe of his limbs. And ſo we gain eaſy light about the ſenſe of this word as uſed in Matt. xxiv. 22. Where it is rendered <hi>ſaved,</hi> as in the text in queſtion; ſhewing that the ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and murderous Fraction of the Jews, were ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly ſhocking and ruinous, that unleſs God had ſhortened the time of their ravagings, they would have deſtroyed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man of their nation; but God to preſerve his elect among them, brought the Roman army on them; which brought the tragedy to a ſpeedy iſſue; and ſo <hi>ſaved</hi> i. e. delivered and preſerved his own elect. And as paſſages of ſcripture ſhould be always underſtood conſiſtently one with another: and as all judges of languages know that <hi>ſoozoo,</hi> the theme of the word in queſtion, properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017812_0010_0FA31B19592D3890"/>
                  <hi>to keep, preſerve,</hi> &amp;c. And not always <hi>to ſave,</hi> as it means future bleſſedneſs. So the text in queſtion teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that God will have all men, in common, provided for, and preſerved; that he may accompliſh the deſign of his government and grace among them. And for this end, he has himſelf made all neceſſary natural proviſion.</p>
               <p>Collateral evidences for this ſenſe of the queſtion are:</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is of ſo much importance to the accompliſhment of divine purpoſes among men, that in common, they ſhould be kept and preſerved; that he himſelf has taken it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically for his ſtile: "The Preſerver of men." Job vii. 20. Pſalm xxxvi. 6.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He has made it one of the principle laws of his moral government in this world, by which men are bound in all their conduct one towards another. Witneſs the 6th commandment.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The text itſelf in queſtion indicates this ſenſe; for it is allowed on all hands, that "the knowledge of the truth" is the qualification for final ſalvation; which qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification is ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anes expreſſed as it is here, by "know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth," often by "believing truth;" and by other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent expreſſions: yet theſe qualifications are never placed after their object; viz. The ſalvation to which they relate. No text of ſcripture ſays <hi>be ſaved,</hi> and <hi>believe.</hi> But the reverſe univerſally. Conſequently, no man who forms his notion of ſcriptural things, by ſcriptural expreſſions, would imagine that final ſalvation is ſo much as thought of, in the text in queſtion. What a ſoliciſm is this! "God will have all men to be ſaved, and then come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth." Or, "and ſo come to the knowledge of the truth." And no man who holds faith of the divin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the Bible will boldly cenſure the form of its inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expreſſions. But ſubmiſſivly allow the divine author underſtood the propriety of language, as well as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its divine materials. And of courſe, conclude, that as the qualification of "knowing truth," is in the inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed order of this text, placed after the doctrine of being <hi>ſaved</hi>; therefore the notion of <hi>ſaved,</hi> in this text means ſomething previous to the knowledge and belief of the truth, and refers to it as its object. And this gives clear light.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:017812_0011_0FA31B1A034B0098"/>I. Why the order of expreſſions were ſo placed, viz. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nauture of their materials were in this order, in the nature of their caſes: and ſo it is beautiful.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That though ſome form of this Greek word is often uſed for final ſalvation, yet it is often uſed otherwiſe: and therefore we are never to conclude, that becauſe ſome form of the word <hi>ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>zoo,</hi> is uſed in a text of ſcripture, it muſt therefore intend final happineſs; for the contrary is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by the inſtances abovementioned.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That when we read the word <hi>ſave,</hi> or <hi>ſaved,</hi> in the tranſlation, we are never to conclude it neceſſarily means final happineſs: becauſe it is certain it often means o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, as has been ſhewed.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That a certain rule by which to judge of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Greek word, and of the word <hi>ſave</hi> or <hi>ſaved,</hi> in the tranſlation, is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Analogy, or agreement with the general run of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for inſpiration uſeth words in ſtricteſt propriety; keeping his eye on other texts where they are uſed, and on the nature of the caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the doctrine of the text, and the previous qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications dictate the ſenſe of theſe words to be final hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we muſt underſtand them ſo, and never otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. But it is here ſaid that "God our Saviour wills" that all men ſhould be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Anſ. 1. God our Saviour wills every thing, which he bringeth to paſs in this world; and ſo whatever is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his efficiency, it is neceſſary he ſhould will its exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The word rendered <hi>will</hi> is <hi>theelei,</hi> which in, I. Cor. vii. 7. ſignifies <hi>to wiſh.</hi> And in Mark. x. 35. it ſignifies <hi>to deſire.</hi> But the deſireableneſs of an object, of itſelf, in no caſe gives certainty of its exiſtence. And when this word is uſed of God, it is certain it can imply no more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, even with reſpect to the ſalvation of men, than what he declares Ezek. xviii. 32, that the perdition, even of the wicked, in itſelf, and for its own ſake, never pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him: his perfect benevolence, has no reliſh for that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, on its own account, but the contrary, viz. That they ſhould "turn and live." But this never affects the deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017812_0012_0FA31B1AC4CDCC20"/>
object; for this object never takes place but in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of abſolute determination, and anſwerable actual efficiency.</p>
               <p>Obj 2. But I apprehend this text means, that God wills the knowledge of truth, in order to ſalvation, though it is named afterward.</p>
               <p>Anſ. This is natural enough; inferiors often have a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pleaſure in dictating to, and correcting their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; but it is quite ſhocking when ſuch as we are, have the front to correct their law-giver; implicitly ſaying, "Lord I conceive thou haſt not ſpoken the thing as it is; and as I preſume thou didſt really intend." J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b indeed with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident propriety accuſeth BILDAD, for not having declared the thing as it is. Job xxvi. 3. But after God had ſpok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, he takes ſhame to himſelf, for "uttering that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not, and ſaying things too wonderful for him." JOB knew he was neither able nor worthy to diſpute a point with his Maker. Job ix. 14, &amp;c. And when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the mind of God, his anſwer was, "I know it is ſo of a truth." Job ix. 2.</p>
               <p>It has been proved already, that the word rendered <hi>ſaved</hi> in I. Tim. ii. 4. is uſed for very different purpoſes; and of courſe, the hope of future happineſs, cannot be built on the uſe of it in this text. It has alſo been proved, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever qualifications for future happineſs are named, in connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that end, as their object, the order of their nature is obſerved; as, "he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, the pure in heart ſhall ſee God, &amp;c." And never the reverſe. Therefore the "ſaved" here expreſſed, is not that ſalvation which follows any knowledge of truth whatſoever.</p>
               <p>Another text on which ſome have harped, as hoping thereby to ſerve a turn, is I. Tim. ii. 6. "Who gave himſelf a ranſom for all." Theſe men conduct very ill, in catching a bit from wiſdoms table, and running, as if for fear of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, nor do they pay due regard to that maxim of moral philoſophy, viz. "Search and ſee if theſe things are ſo." Otherwiſe they would eaſily find a clue, which would guide them to a clear and conſiſtent underſtanding of this divine paſſage, viz. That Paul, the writer of this epiſtle was a Jew; and had been thoroughly verſed and rooted in the Jewiſh notions of GOD and religion; according to that ſummary which our Saviour reaſoning with the woman of Samaria,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017812_0013_0FA31B1B8320B090"/>
couched in this aphoriſm, "Salvation is of the Jews." which the apoſtle illuſtrates, when he ſays, "Whoſe are the Fathers, and of whom as concerning the fleſh, Chriſt came, to whom alſo belonged the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the ſervice of GOD, and the promiſes. Rom. ix. 4, 5. All this the Jews knew, and alſo that from <hi>their Zion,</hi> was the law to go forth; and the word of the Lord from <hi>their Jeruſalem.</hi> Iſa. ii. 3. In conſequence of all this, the Jews appropriated every favourable conſideration of God. Jeſus Chriſt, Bible, religion, holy duties, and acceptible obedience to their own nation. This laid the foundation of their prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and zeal againſt chriſtianity, and occaſioned the primary and arduous labours of the apoſtles, to convince them that GOD was determined to ſhew himſelf the GOD of other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as of the Jews; and this point labored extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the apoſtolic age. It was a capital article with the apoſtle Paul, eſpecially after he turned to the Gentiles, to root out this deep prejudice of his nation; for he knew that the goſpel and its bleſſings going to the Gentiles did not at all prevent hope to the Jews. He is therefore often inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this great and glorious benevolence of their GOD, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and gain them over to a like catholic &amp; benevolent mind. This is the obvious reaſon of Pauls uſing this univerſal mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllable ALL, exceeding often. He knew alſo that his dear ſon Timothy was nearly related to the Jews, for his mother was a Jeweſs; and it ſeems his father was a proſelyte to them; and this ſon had from a child, been brought up in the ſtricteſt obſervance of the Jewiſh ſyſtem. II. Tim. iii. 15. Now in view of this general ſtate of things, obſerve the tenor of this context.</p>
               <p>The apoſtle aſſures Timothy what principles he was poſſeſt of, viz. faith, as to what God had made him underſtand of his deſigns: and love, as of the ſame kind with what God had diſplayed in converting, and calling him to the goſpel miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and which muſt therefore flow in the extenſive channel of its original, the love of God, ſo as by faith he believed Gods mind revealed towards poor Gentiles, ſo his love drew him the ſame way; and all this he has in Chriſt Jeſus. 1 Tim. i, 14. for though Jeſus Chriſt was humanely of the Jews, yet his perfect merit was diſplayed, and his blood ſhed without thoſe walls, as giving hope, and being full of promiſe to other nations as well as that.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:017812_0014_0FA31B1C44B78CD0"/>2. The ſource of theſe principles was the grace of God, which could flow to Gentiles as freely as to Jews, becauſe his motive is in himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He points out his pattern and example, Jeſus Chriſt who came into the world, not Jewry only, but the world, his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs therefore was to ſave ſinners. 15. v. not profeſſing Jews only, but ſuch as were moſt notoriouſly without deſerving, poor Gentiles. Implying at the ſame time all this was couched in chuſing me, whoſe ill-deſerving exceeded all: and in this he gave pattern to thoſe, who by men were judged to have no claim at all on the fountain of goodneſs, viz. the Gentiles. 16, v. On this he builds his eminent celebration of the only wiſe God, that he ſhould diſplay ſuch extenſivneſs of heart. 17. v. and then proceeds to his ſolemn charge to his ſon Timothy, 18, v. that he ſhould not conduct himſelf according to the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and contracted principles in which he had been educated; but keep the faith, 19. v. that his conſcience might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the government of what God ſhewed was his will, viz. that Gentiles ſhould be equally the ſubjects of his mercy as the Jews. The apoſtle knew it always was the deſign of God that Japhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſhould dwell in the tents of Shem, Gen. ix. 27. and God had made him ſee and know that it was now to be fulfilled, in Gentiles being brought into the priviledges of the viſible church, he therefore urgeth it on his ſon Timothy by every means as the determined object of divine counſels: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſummary of what he and Timothy had to do, and this is the reaſon why he begins and proceeds in this ſecond chapter, with this matter of his faith full in his eye; inſiſting on it that Timothy ſhould not confine his prayers to the Jews, either as a nation, or as a church; but ſhould extend them conſtantly to all men, to Gentiles as much as Jews, and to kings which could not be among the Jews, at that time; the reaſon he aſſigns for all this, is, for this pleaſeth God, 3, v. whoſe will is, that all thoſe priviledges tending to ſalvation, ſhould be extended to Gentiles, juſt as they uſed to be indulged to the Jews; for he now intends Gentiles ſhall be ſaved as well as Jews, 4, v. and therefore they muſt have the means of knowing the truth, And then crowns all,</p>
               <p n="1">1. With a mighty argument to his purpoſe, drawn from the unity of the divine nature, 5 v. as if he had ſaid, there is but one God; the Gentiles are as much his creatures as the Jews, &amp; his ſufficiency of power and grace are as equal to their caſe, as to that of the Jews, according to Rom. iii. 29. and they have as much to attract his good will.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017812_0015_0FA31B1D03307B88"/>2. He argueth equally from the oneneſs of mediatorſhip; there is but one mediator, and he always propoſed his object to be world, not Jewry only; nay the place of his death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without the walls of Jeruſalem, as well as the avowed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his miſſion, had an eminently promiſing aſpect to the Gentiles. yea,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The object of his mediatorſhip in this world, determines the ſame point; this was not Jews, but Men. 5, v. now Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are men, as well as Jews; therefore for Gentiles he gave himſelf a ranſom, as well as for Jews, and ſo it appears from the tenor of the whole conteſt, that by giving himſelf a ranſom for all, 6, v. there is no deſign to ſhew the efficacy of his death, as to the number of its individual objects; but that its general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was as much Gentiles as Jews, it will be proved to certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the ſequel, that every individual among either Jews or Gentiles were never actually ſavingly benefitted by that ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom nor ever will be, but that the Gentiles had equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages by it as the Jews, and as this is evidently the deſign of the text; what folly, muſt it appear for any to riſk his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expectation of eternal life, on this ALL? which has no reſpect to the individual objects of the ranſom; but only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms an equal general reſpect to Gentiles, as to Jews, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Timothy to comport with the revealed will of God in that caſe; and no longer reſtrain his views, prayers and labours to Jews only, as ſuppoſing they were the only objects of that ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; intended equally for others, as for them.</p>
               <p>Another text of ſcripture which ſome lean upon, who ſeem to want more ſupport to their hope, than the God of hope has given them, is, I Tim. iv. 10. which is thus rendered, "the living God, who is the ſaviour of all men". On which we ſhould obſerve,</p>

               <p n="2">II. It is not the manner of the ſcripture, to aſcribe the ſalvation of men, immediately to the firſt perſon in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Three. It is not conſiſtent with the revealed order of operation, with thoſe ſacred perſonalities. But the ſtile "living God," of whom the Saviourſhip of this text is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated, is known to be the emphatical diſtinction of the firſt perſonality. By Mat. xvi. 16. "Thou art Chriſt, the ſon of the living God." Alſo by John vi. 69. "We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and are ſure, thou art that Chriſt the ſon of the living God." It therefore follows that ſuture ſalvation is not ſo much as thought of in this text.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thoſe who build their hope of univerſal ſalvation on this text, muſt ſuppoſe, either that ſome are ſaved without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, or that the ſalvation of believers is a different thing in itſelf from that of others, becauſe this text ſays "he is the the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe who believe". There is ſomething in the ſalvation of believers, according to thoſe men, ſpecially diſtinct from that of others, and it muſt be their having ſaith, which ſome who are ſaved have not, or in the quality of their ſalvation, whereas in the true ſenſe of this text, there is no difficulty; for God is indeed the preſerver of all men; but he eſpecially watcheth over, and cares for ſuch, as by believing put their truſt in him, ſo it appears, thoſe who flatter themſelves about a univerſal ſalvation, have no ground at all in this text.</p>
               <p>In the next place our attention is called to a text of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon which ſome venture their univerſal building, right or wrong; &amp; which they have forced into the ſervice of their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginition, and it is, I. John ii, 2. "He is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, by alſo for the ſins of the whole world." All we have to do here is to find the mind of God, in theſe laſt words, "the whole world." Now this expreſſion is uſed variouſly in the Bible; let us carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it. The word in this text rendered <hi>world</hi> is <hi>roſmos.</hi> But this word in Rom. xi. 12. means the Gentiles, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the Jews, as any one may ſee. But then we begin to ſee that this word in the text in queſtion may not mean every body. And Mr. LEIGH, Critc. Ver. Says it means the Gentiles in oppoſition to the Jews. It is certainly uſed in John. xv. 18. &amp;c. For only a part of mankind; which will appear by turning to the paſſage. For it is uſed as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017812_0017_0FA31B1E82F69F08"/>
for ſuch as oppoſed the Apoſtles. So we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other evidence, it does not mean all men, in John xvi. 8. The ſame word is expreſsly limited to unbelievers; exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of all who believe in Chriſt;—ſo in John xiv. 17. It is uſed for ſuch as cannot receive the ſpirit of truth; excluſive of thoſe who receive him, and in the 17, v. of the ſame chapter, for all except the diſciples, of courſe this word don't neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily mean all men it is uſed with like limitation, John xv, 19. and xvii, 9, v. it means thoſe for whom the ſaviour of man did not ſo much as aſk for ſalvation, and in I. Cor. vi, 2. it means only ſuch as ſhall be finally judged by the ſaints, in Heb. xi, 7. he means only ſuch as were condemned by Noah's conduct in building the ark, it is ſaid with like limitation, II. Pet. ii. 5.</p>
               <p>But we ſhall be told the expreſſion in this, I. John ii, 2. is much more emphatical, it is <hi>peri co ou tou Koſmo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. For the whole world.</hi> Yet we ſhall ſoon ſee to certainty, that other texts of equal authority prove, that this phraſe is no foundation for the notion of univerſal ſalvation. We are told, Rom. i. 8. that the faith of the Roman Chriſtians was ſpoken of "throughout the whole world." And yet every body knows, that thoſe who ſit in darkneſs, and ſaw no goſpel-light; even whole nations, who at that day, had neither heard, or thought of the chriſtian faith, are not included in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Of courſe, it is raſh, and dangerous, for creatures of yeſterday, and going before an inflexible and righteous judge, to build their hope of univerſal ſalvation on an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which the ſcriptures uſe in a limited ſenſe. "The whole world" through which the faith of a few believers at <hi>Rome,</hi> was celebrated, at that time, could not likely be more than the "Roman empire;" and it is probable that ſeveral he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>then nations within that monarchy, never heard, thought, of concerned themſelves at all about the faith of a few individuals at <hi>Rome.</hi> Yet in ſuch a limited ſenſe is this phraſe uſed in the holy word. See I. John v. 19. "The whole world lieth in wickedneſs," and yet in the ſame verſe he expreſſes himſelf, the Parthian chriſtians, and all who are of God. So far therefore is this expreſſion from ſerving the purpoſe of thoſe who in a very miſtaken manner confide in it. Many other ſcriptures of the ſame ſenſe which uſe the word <hi>all</hi> inſtead of <hi>the whole,</hi> are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently uſed, with like reſtriction. For as <hi>Ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of any thing, is all of that thing; and all is the whole; and are uſed ſo, except where reſtriction in their import is ſufficiently made manifeſt. Of courſe, no conſiderate man will draw concluſion, abſolutely univerſal, from univerſal expreſſions, till he finds whether the ſame authority or the nature of the caſe, has not reſtrained their real import. We may ſee an inſtance in Luke ii. 1. "There went out a decree from Caeſar Auguſtus, that all the world ſhould be taxed." And yet it is obvious, that no more can be meant, than ſuch parts of the world, as were under CAESAR's juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; which though it was extenſive, yet far, very far from being abſolutely univerſal. Juſt ſo it is with regard to the ſubjects of the chriſtian propitiation. They ſhall be a number beyond the poſſibility of numerical calculation. Rev. vii. 9. Yet no more than were elected to ſalvation from among men, and were called, juſtified and ſanctified, as will be proved hereafter. Another univerſal phraſe we have Mat. iv. 8. which is neceſſarily reſtrained, by a very figurative meaning. It is ſaid the Devil ſhewed to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour "all the kingdoms of the world." But there is no ſpot in the univerſe which gives advantage to any corporeal eye-ſight to ſee ſo much; nor any viſive faculty in nature ſufficient for it.</p>
               <p>So it is certain that none of thoſe who try to confide in the univerſal form of expreſſion, in the text in queſtion; can give themſelves any aſſurance of ſafety in it, we find an inſtance of this kind of expreſſion in Rev. iii. 10. "I will keep the from the hour of temptation, which ſhall come on all the world, no doubt this hour of temptation was that moſt ſhocking ſcene of perſecution, practiſed by heathen Romans, againſt chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, for above two hundred years before Conſtantine the great, in what a reſtrained ſenſe is every man obliged to underſtand this expreſſion; when, long and bloody as it was, it could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no further than the bounds of the Roman Empire? ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtance of a like limited ſenſe, to a like unlimited phraſe is in Rev. xiii, 3. and all the world, wandered after the beaſt, but the vii, v. ſays he made war with the ſaints, did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he ſaints wander after the beaſt? no ſurely! or if they did, did the beaſt make war with ſuch as wandered after him? then this univerſal expreſſion, can't be underſtood univerſally, we can get nothing then, drawing concluſions in ſuch caſes, which the Bible itſelf, will not warrant, nor the common ſenſe of conſiderate men, ſupport.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:017812_0019_0FA31B2002F4B2D8"/>Let us now confine a little more to the text in queſtion. He is the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world. Let me freely aſk the reader, do you think he is ſo for thoſe liars, deſcribed in the 4. v. who do not his commandments; and of whom he ſays the truth is not in them? is he the propitiation for the ſins of thoſe who walk not as he walked? 6. v. is he ſo, for ſuch as walk in darkneſs, even untill now? 9. v. is he ſo for ſuch as hate their brethren, walk in darkneſs, and know not whither they go, 11. v.? for ſuch as love the world, and have not the love of God in them? 15. v. nay, for ſuch as are totally governed by the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and by the pride of life, which the ſame apoſtle ſays are not of the father, but are of the world in oppoſition to the father? 16, v. the very ſuppoſition that all theſe are yet the ſubjects of that ſaving propitiation, is to make the ſcripture abſurd, inconſiſtant, and perfectly uninteligible, and he who holds this ſentiment, would be aſhamed to alledge any thing out of the ſame Bible in ſupport of it.</p>
               <p>The truth of the whole affair is this; this epiſtle was written to ſuch Jews, as had been driven out of their own country by former perſecutions, and large numbers of them had found ſanctuary in Parthia, a country far from their own land, in the eaſtern part of Aſia, and having no communication with their native country, nor means to know how it fared with chriſtians there, ſince they left that land, and their brethren diſtreſſed with perſecution, inſpiration directs this apoſtle, to write them this epiſtle to inform them what the father of light had taught them, ſince their expulſion, and how the chriſtian intereſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and among many documents, he tells them that chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity was yet triumphant, not only among the Jews in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but alſo among the Gentiles; inſomuch that contrary to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> their old traditions, the true religion obtained, and remiſſion of ſins was granted equally to the Gentiles, as to the Jews, ſo that the propitiation was applied to, was evidently as effectual for the reſt of the world, as it was at firſt for thoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, and many others among the Jews, therefore he ſays, "not for our ſins only, but for thoſe of the whole world," that is, juſt ſo for others wherever its doctrine comes, as it was at firſt for us. The apoſtle knew, that thoſe Parthians knew that only ſome of the Jews had ſaving benefits formerly by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation; juſt ſo, ſays he it is now among the Gentiles. The world in common, whom we were wont to deem accurſed, and caſt of by God, have now the ſame priviledge as we had at firſt.

The partition wall is now broken down, and to this ſenſe of <hi>World,</hi> whole <hi>World,</hi> all the <hi>World,</hi> &amp;c. all the inſtances above quoted, and many others, perfectly agree, and in no other ſenſe of this, and other ſuch like paſſages of ſcripture, does the Bible agree, either with itſelf, or with providential executions. As ſurely therefore as the Bible is a ſyſtem, conſiſtent with itſelf, or with its faithful and univerſal executor, divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſo ſurely this and no more than this, is the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the text in queſtion.</p>
               <p>Another paſſage which has been wreſted out of its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent latitude to favor the deſired univerſality, is. Tit. ii. 11. "For the grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to all men." Every man who reads the Bible, and is attentive to what he reads, may obſerve this text refers to time then paſt, "hath appeared." But to all ſuch leaders, it is evident enough, that at that time, the Bible and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> contents, had appeared to but a very few of mankind. And ſo it is certain at firſt ſight, that the device of ſalvation for all men univerſally, has no ſupport of this text. It was indeed true then, and ſo it is ſtill, that wherever the Bible comes, it appears plainly enough to all who are rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attentive to what they ſee in it, that it is a ſcheme of grace, very free grace: and that eternal ſalvation is its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And that by its grace, the worſt of men, may happily attain to that object. But it is juſt as evident from all parts of this divine ſyſtem, that it never deſigned every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual to that happineſs, as it is from the letter of this text, compared with thoſe times, that they had not attained to it then.</p>
               <p>The next object of our attention muſt be a paſſage in Eph. i. 10. "That he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth." Alſo a paſſage of li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. Of courſe, it appears that <hi>all men</hi> cannot be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of deſign in theſe texts, both becauſe <hi>things</hi> only are named, and not men at all, and alſo becauſe the univerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, even of things, is limited and reſtrained, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their caſes.

               <p n="2">2. An infinite multitude of things on earth, beſides all beaſts are neceſſarily excluded from the meaning of both theſe texts. Beſides, one character of devils, is, that they "go to and fro in the earth, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. It is evident that all things abſolutely in heaven and earth cannot be included in the deſign of theſe texts; both becauſe a great many are naturally incapable of it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is abſurd to be ſuppoſed of ſome other. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for inſtance, that holy angels ſhould he included in this reconciliaton, becauſe they never hated any view of the divine nature and will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The above ſentiments on the firſt of theſe texts are confirmed by the ſupplement in the 11th v. viz. In whom <hi>alſo</hi> we, the Epheſian ſaints, "have obtained an inheritance." This <hi>alſo</hi> ſhews that the Epheſian chriſtians were not in the above collection; for the ſuppoſition of it would make this paſſage tautologous, and abſurd. And to ſhew that by <hi>all things</hi> in the laſt of theſe texts, is not meant all men; a like ſupplement is alſo added including ſome of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians, in the following verſe. So it is evident <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the notion of ſalvation for all men, has no ſupport at all from
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017812_0022_0FA31B2242F03E38"/>
either of theſe texts. The next portion of inflexible truth, in which ſome are ſeeking room for their notion of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all men, is in Rom. v. 18. "The free gift came upon all men."</p>
               <p n="1">1. The aſſertors of univerſal ſalvation, ought to have been very ſure that the word <hi>all,</hi> certainly means every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual of the kind, before they place ſuch importance on it in this text, or any other. But in order to gain ſuch certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they muſt make great alterations in the following ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, viz. Acts xxii. 15. Which ſays that Paul ſhould be "God's witneſs to all men." But this is fully explained by the 21ſt verſe. "I will ſend thee to the Gentiles." For when divine adminiſtrations and miſſions, which had been peculiar to the Jews, becauſe common to Gentiles with the Jews, then they were common to all men, becauſe Jews and Gentiles, were all men. Although there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitudes of both ſorts which Paul never ſaw; and to whom his teſtimony never did, nor ever will arrive. Eſpecially thoſe who never ſaw him in life, and have ſince paſſed into eternity, without the advantage of it. So alſo I. Theſſ. ii. 15. "They are contrary to all men." Yet ſurely not to themſelves! nor in general to their own nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but to the Gentiles, whom the Jews diſpiſed and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in general; but not univerſally, for ſome Gentiles were well accepted proſelites. Alſo Eph. iii. 9. Paul was to make "all men ſee the fellowſhip of the goſpel-myſtery." Yet ſurely, not ſuch as he never ſaw, nor who ever ſaw or heard of him; which is much the greateſt part of human nature, both before and ſince. But it is endleſs, as well as needleſs, to multiply inſtances of the uſe of theſe univerſal phraſes in a very partial and limited ſenſe. And is it the part of any rational being to venture eternity on ſo preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a foundation?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the true key to this text is the words <hi>even ſo.</hi> For this text contains a noted parity between the firſt and ſecond Adam; ſhewing the medium through which juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation flowed to ſome by the ſecond Adam, was of the ſame kind, with that by which condemnation flowed to all men, from the firſt Adam. But what was that medium in caſe of the firſt Adam? The anſwer is <hi>federal headſhip.</hi> Now put the words of equation, or correſpondency, <hi>even ſo</hi>; and then we ſhall ſee the truth of the text, viz. As all who were in the firſt federal headſhip, ſuffered by the offence
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017812_0023_0FA31B2303C36CB8"/>
of one; <hi>even ſo.</hi> Juſt ſo, all who were in the ſecond fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral headſhip, live by the ſecond Adam. And this is the plain ſenſe of another text by which many through inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſeem to be ſeduced, viz. I. Cor. xv. 22. "For as in Adam all die, <hi>even ſo</hi> in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive." For a federal headſhip was the only mean of imputation, in the firſt caſe; <hi>even ſo</hi> it was in the laſt. So that all thoſe who are in the covenant of works are dead in Adam: juſt ſo, all who are in the covenant of grace are alive in Jeſus Chriſt. So it appears that theſe two <hi>alls,</hi> are meaſured by the medium of connection with their reſpective princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal. And ſo we ſee that want of attention to the word of truth, or a worſe cauſe, has occaſioned all the confidence about univerſal ſalvation on this text of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>Another holy expreſſion, which much againſt its own mind, has been preſſed into the ſervice of univerſal ſalvation, is, Luke ii. 10. In which the angel ſaid to the ſhepherd, "I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people." The inſpired expreſſion is <hi>panti too l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Which is <hi>omni populo</hi>; to every people. A very general expreſſion. BEZA, ſays in Mat. iv. It is not ſimply univerſal, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite. And ſo this univerſal particle is uſed, I. Cor. x. 23. where the apoſtle ſays "all things are lawful for me." Of which every body knows it is not meant of abſolute univerſality. It is ſeveral times uſed with like limitation, I. Cor. ix. 22. and exceeding often elſewhere. So Chriſt is ſaid to heal "all diſeaſes," Mat. ix. 35. That is, ſome of all kinds; to ſhew that none exceeded him, either by being of long ſtanding, or great malignancy. In a like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſenſe, the angel's tidings were matter of great joy, not to the Jews only, among whom the holy Babe was born; but to all people, to Gentiles as well as Jews, without one thought of reſpect to every individual of any people. So when any great good occurs to a country or people, it is matter of great joy, although a thouſand individuals are not benefitted by it; as independence to America: though male-contents count it the ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Its being matter of great joy to all people, that the Meſſiah was born in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, is no evidence that every perſon will have ſaving benefit thereby; it was matter of great joy to the angels themſelves; but they had no thought of ſalvation thereby. But it being the very higheſt inſtance of benevolence, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded great joy from all people, without regard to ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

an object as perſonal benefit; though it were that of ſalvation by it. In this view the paſſage in queſtion agrees with all the reſt in the Bible; and with all the reſt of the Bible agrees to reject the crude imagination of ſalvation for all men.</p>
               <p>Another portion of conſiſtent truth which has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſupport the above antiſcriptural notion of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all men, is, I. Tim. vi. 13. "I give thee charge in the ſight of God who quickneth all things." Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs every judicious reader, will judge the a bettors of this notion of ſalvation of men, are ſtraightened for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Bible, when they alledge ſuch a paſſage as this for their ſupport. But all who are taught of God to guard againſt dangerous ſubtilties; ſhould be thankful that men are not able to bury ſuch a ſnare deep, nor guard it with one good divine evidence. The inſpired expreſſion in this text is <hi>zooopoiountos ta panta. Who maketh all things alive.</hi> On which obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">I. This text relates not to men, but to things. At leaſt, no more to mankind, than to all other creatures, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive life and quickning from God, the univerſal Quickner. Therefore this ſame word is uſed Rom. viii. 11. For the efficatious cauſe of the reſurrection; becauſe exerted on mere matter, to cauſe life and motion to commence where it was not. Again it is uſed, I. Cor. xv. 36. as having equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the germination of wheat after ſowing, as to the raiſing of dead bodies at the laſt day. It is uſed alſo, Rom. iv. 17. As importing the efficacy by which ability for coition was revived in Abraham; and by which crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion itſelf recieved exiſtence.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The word here rendered <hi>quickneth</hi> ſignifies <hi>to make alive.</hi> And ſo has no relation to the caſe which it is named to ſerve. And CHANICER, one of the ancients ſays, there is no place in the New Teſtament, where it does not ſignify, <hi>vitam accipere, qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> quis non habebat.</hi> Leigh in verb. i. e. to recieve a life which the ſubject had not before. It is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable therefore that this text ſhould be thought of, as a ſupport to the above named doctrine.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt attend to what is named for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in Rev. v. 13. The ſum of which is, "every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in heaven, earth, and under the earth, and in the ſea, ſaid, bleſſing and honor and glory and power, be to him who ſitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017812_0025_0FA31B24855DA070"/>
ever." And does the reader think that every great cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of God and the Lamb implies the ſalvation of all men? But we have often been told, that the argument which proves too much, doth in fact prove nothing at all. Now if all the actors in this notable triumph, are ſuppoſed to be the ſubjects of the great ſalvation; then not only all men, but all the angels in heaven, nay all the beaſts on earth, and monſters of the deep, are as much the ſubjects of that ſalvation as men. Some indeed have ſo far diſintangled themſelves from the reſtraints of common ſenſe, and alſo of the word of God, as to pretend ſalvation finally for devils, but what have beaſts, either by land or ſea to do with it? And it is as certain holy angels are not ſaved by the croſs of Chriſt. So that this argument engroſſeth much more than can be true; and conſequently anſwers no purpoſe at all; except to diſplay a diſpoſition for trifling with ſacred things, and to anticipate a certain ſhame and confuſion of face.</p>
               <p>Beſides the word rendered <hi>Creature,</hi> in this text is <hi>Ktiſma.</hi> And I. Tim. iv. 4. uſing the ſame words, ſays, "every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God is good." Where it evidently means our daily food, or common means of nouriſhment. By which it might ſeem, the triumph of the text in queſtion is ſomehow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to the material creation. And ſo it is a figure of ſpeech called <hi>Anthro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The prophet Iſa. lv.c. 12. v. having commemorated many great works of God to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that ſtate of the church; and given aſſurance that he would ſend the Meſſiah to them, firſt deſcribes their joy, and then carries over their affections to the material world, and ſays, "the mountains and hills ſhall break forth into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Perhaps this and a thouſand other ſuch like figurative expreſſions are in reſerve, for the next ſott of evidences to

ſupport the cauſe. And doubtleſs there will be time enough to advance them all before God's ſealed ones ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. This ſame word is alſo uſed James i. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. where the apoſtle draws a parallel between thoſe among men, whom God will accept to ſalvation, and the firſt fruits under the law. Now only the firſt fruits, under the law were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God; they were his portion of all the fruits of the field. And this was the figure of thoſe among men, who ſhould be ſaved. Therefore we read, Rev. xiv. 4. "Theſe are they which follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth; thoſe were redeemed from among men, being the firſt fruits to God and the Lamb." Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It appears, that the text in queſtion is ſo far from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the doctrine of ſalvation for all men, that it ſays not one word diſtinctly about men at all. But in order to celebrate the dying love of Chriſt, for his <hi>firſt fruits</hi> among men; the creation in general is animated with ſongs, and made to ſecond the ſhouts of thoſe who are redeemed in praiſe of their redemption.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And the reaſon of this form of triumph is 3. v. becauſe inquiſition had been made through all created nature, for ſome one, able to open the abovementioned book of God's deſigns, and execute its import; but none was found able, till the lion of the Tribe of Judah appeared. And as all creatures are ſome way intereſted in the ſovereign determ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inations of God concerning this world; ſo the nature of their caſe is repreſented, by this univerſal triumph; import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now we ſhall all know the true ſtate of things, and the whole of divine counſels about us: and as "the Lord is righteous in all his ways;" ſo no fear of the conſequence; for if our nature and taſte are not ſerved, and fully ſuited by every execution; yet two things are infallible; and both worthy of a God, and both worthy of higheſt acclamations from us all: viz. His own honor, and the general good of the creatures, are both ſecure.</p>
               <p>Another portion of ſcripture by which ſome indeavor to ſupport their notion of ſalvation, is, I. Cor. xv. 27. "He hath put all things under his feet." On which obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The word of action in this text is <hi>upetaxen.</hi> Which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that God put every thing in its proper place and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, under the dominion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this appointment, he rules the world, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the beaſts of the field, the wilderneſs, and the ſea.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:017812_0027_0FA31B266B338E18"/>
And ſo this text is a comment on the words of Chriſt. Mat. xxviii. 18. "All power is given me, in heaven and earth." And can of courſe, no more imply ſalvation for all men, than for the brutal world, and holy angels. Beſides,</p>
               <p n="2">2. This conſtruction of the text is confirmed by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; which ſhews that nothing was excluded from this abſolute ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt, but the Father only.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This text verifieth the royal prophecy, Pſalm vii. 6. "Thou madeſt him," viz. Jeſus Chriſt; "to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou haſt put all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet." Which confirms the object of this text, to be the material creation. And ſo it is immediately exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by the Pſalmiſt; 7 &amp; 8. v. "All ſheep and oxen, yea and the beaſts of the field; fowls of the air, and fiſhes of the ſea." Which may guard all people againſt the abuſe of this text.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Therefore the ancients rendered this Greek word, not be obedient, as of intelligent ſubjects; but <hi>be ye ſubject,</hi> as implying mere abſolute dominion; and ſome of them paſſiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>be ye ſubjected.</hi> And Heb. ii. 8. ſupports this conſtruction. "Thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet; and haſt left nothing that is not put under him." Therefore ſuch as ſupport their notion of ſalvation of men from this text, muſt either mean that the material creation is the ſubject of chriſtian ſalvation; or they uſe ſcripture without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its import. But ſuch as fear God, will not trifle with his word, nor careleſsly deceive their fellow men.</p>

               <p>Now we ſhould attend to a few Points, that we may ſee if theſe Things are ſo.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the ſubject of which this word is predicated, is of interminable duration, either by its own nature, or by appointment, in all ſuch caſes the import of this word is neceſſarily eternity.

               <p>As to the Greek <hi>aioon,</hi> and its derivatives, the reader may ſee the divine uſe of them in the following inſtances.

ſhall never periſh;" the words are <hi>ais ton aioona.</hi> And if this text implies eternal exiſtence, then that is the import of <hi>aioona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo John xi. 26. "Whoſoever liveth and believeth in me ſhall never die." The words are <hi>ais ton aioona.</hi> And if never to die neceſſarily implies eternity of life, then this word implies eternity.</p>
               <p>Once more John xii. 34. "We have heard that Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth <hi>ais ton aioona, forever.</hi> As plainly then as eternity is aſcribed to Chriſt; ſo plainly it is imported in this word. LEIGH's Crit. Sac. in Verb. ſays it ſignifies <hi>Eternity.</hi> And that the ancients held that puniſhment eternal, on which this word was predicated. And this is evidently the ſenſe of the word in the abovementioned. Mat. xii. 32. and Mark iii. 29.</p>
               <p>And as to the Hebrew word <hi>Guolam,</hi> the critick above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ſays it deſigns "abſolute perpetuity, eternity;" when it affirms of God, or things in their own nature eternal; and it will be ſtill further proved in the ſequel, that future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo. The abovenamed Reply obſerves that the import of thoſe words is meaſured by the ſubject to which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f to the Jewiſh ſtate of the church, or its ordinances; the mountains, &amp;c. The durability imported in theſe words is equal to that of their ſubject. So when they apply to God, his gracious covenant, or the future ſtate of exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they import duration equal to their ſubject. And it has been proved by plain texts, that the above Greek word often neceſſarily means eternity. Therefore the ſchoolmen ſay, that wicked men are juſtly puniſhed <hi>in eterno Dei,</hi> who have ſinned <hi>in eterno Deo.</hi> i. e. They ſhall be puniſhed through eternity, as meaſured by God, who have ſinned through their whole life here. And this Hebrew word certainly means eternity in the moſt abſolute ſenſe in Pſalm x. 16. "The Lord is king for ever and ever." And in Exod. xv. 18. "The Lord ſhall reign for ever and ever." Beſides,</p>
               <p n="2">II. Sinful men are of a totally depraved nature, and a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally morally depraved nature; as ſuch, cannot poſſibly be happy; happineſs muſt be according to conſciouſneſs. If conſcience witneſſeth only of moral evil, it can only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe without ceſſation; and ſo give ſenſe of miſery. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuch ſubject can receive nothing but penalty in a righteous government. And ſo both from itſelf, and from the government over it, muſt be miſerable. And this caſe
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017812_0031_0FA31B2903ECC2C0"/>
muſt be as durable, as the internal propenſities of man. If then his time of probation is ſpent in ſinning, the nature of his caſe will make him miſerable as long as his nature laſts.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Such a nature, retaining its predominant propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, cannot ceaſe from ſinning; its own propenſities will act out their own nature; and of courſe, ſins will, and muſt encreaſe during exiſtence. And ſo there will be the ſame ſort of reaſon for infliction of puniſhment, as at firſt; and this is the natural ſubjective reaſon, for puniſhment at all, and for the eternity of it.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The demerit of ſin, is meaſured by its object, the direct object of ſin, is the holy law, its ultimate object is the divine nature; both are of perfect, unlimitable, and ſo eternal rectitude and goodneſs. Exactly anſwerable thereto is the demerit of their contempt. But the ſinning ſubject is very finite; conſequently puniſhment cannot be adequately endured, but by duration equal to its object. And this is the natural objective reaſon for the neceſſarily endleſs dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of future puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Of ſome ſinners it is ſaid Heb. vi. that it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> to renew them to repentance. And will any dare to hold, that it is not only poſſible, but certain, that ſalvation ſhall be had, where God their Maker, has ſaid it is <hi>impoſſible</hi>?</p>
               <p n="6">VI. They talk of ſome making atonement for their own ſins, by ſuffering an anſwerable ſpace in hell. It will be no honor to Jeſus Chriſt, for ſuch to arrive at, and dwell in heaven; for thereby they get only what they have earned, and deſerved. They do not arrive there by Jeſus Chriſt's merit, but by their own. They have ballanced the account with divine juſtice, by their own ſufferings. Perhaps the reader will judge this is another inſtance of the devils ſcheme acted over again. "Ye ſhall not ſurely die, but ye ſhall yourſelves <hi>be as Gods.</hi>"</p>
               <p n="7">VII. The following ſcriptures abſolutely ſix the eternity of future puniſhment, viz. Mat. xxv. 46. "Theſe ſhall go away into <hi>Kolafin aioonion, everlaſting puniſhment. But the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous eis zooeen aioonian, into life eternal.</hi> The antitheſis fixeth the equality of theſe two repreſentations of eternity. The ſame word, which generally ſignifies eternity, as has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is equally uſed for them both. Therefore they are both of equal duration.</p>

               <p>Again, II. Peter ii. 14,—17. The apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome as "curſed children, for whom is reſerved the miſt of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was made a curſe. It that was infinite, the idea of infiniteneſs is contained in this curſedneſs; which for a mere creature to endure, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily requires eternity.</p>

But ſome may imagine the aſſertors of univerſal ſalvation do not mean to include Papiſts But pray why not? are not Papiſts men? And many of them far from being the greateſt ſinners, for want of the cleareſt light.

And ſuch a have any mark of the beaſt, or falſe prophet about them, had need be ware. For the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their puniſhment is quite interminable.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third of theſe miſcellaneous ſentiments is, God ſwore in his wrath, that ſome ſhould not enter into the reſt of Canaan. Pſalm 95.11.

From this priſon none can come forth, till they have paid the uttermoſt farthing. Mat. v. 25 But for a finite being as man, to pay the uttermoſt farthing of an infinite debt, neceſſarily employs eternity, as has been ſhewed. Therefore all men are not ſaved; not can thoſe who periſh be diſcharged.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Mat. xxvi. 24. Says of Judas "it had been good for him, if he had not been born." But if in any future period of duration, he ſhould be diſcharged from his own place, and enjoy the happineſs of the heavenly ſtate thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forever; then this text would be evidently not true; for a perfect bleſſedneſs, for a thouſandth part of that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py duration, muſt be in ſome ſenſe, infinitely better than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

               <p n="8">VIII. In Mat. xxv. 41. the final ſentence of baniſhment from the preſence and enjoyment of God is in theſe words: "Depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels." On which we may note,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The word in this ſentence rendered everlaſting, is <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of courſe, while that ſtate of puniſhment is the portion of the devil and his angels, theſe devoted ſouls muſt inhabit with them. Either therefore the damnation of devils is limited, or that of wicked men is unlimited. For the latter are given up to the very ſame place and portion as the former.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The very notion of <hi>burning</hi> in theſe figurative deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of hell, implies ſenſible hopeleſſneſs, or knowledge of interminability of ſuffering. If there was a poſſible hope of eſcape, or terminability, the eſſence of this idea of <hi>burning,</hi> would ceaſe. Thoſe ſufferings would be very great, but not <hi>burning.</hi> That the notion of burning implies abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute deſparation, appears,</p>

                  </gap>ight from God. The wicked in this life have the fire and the worm, but not <hi>burning Fire,</hi> nor <hi>never dying Worm.</hi> But when the worm gets to be <hi>Outeleuta never to be finiſhed</hi>; then the fire alſo becomes burning fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears from the corroſiveneſs of burning fire, that fire exiſts in a thouſand inſtances, where it is not burning fire. But as ſoon as it is burning fire, it corrodes. 'Tis abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute deſperation, or knowledge of interminability of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that corrodes and totally deſtroys all ſelf enjoyment or hope; and this is abſolutely burning. Therefore the Bible ſpeaks the thing as it is, everlaſting burning!</p>
               <p>So the Univerſaliſts have not only deviſed an eſcape finally from the ſufferings to which GOD has aſſigned the wicked hereafter, but they have quenched the <hi>burning</hi> fire while they are in puniſhment, and alſo prevented the preying worm. But is not all this a daring oppoſition to divine eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? And as penalty is the ſupport of all law, ſo they have by this means enervated, and made void the laws of GOD. And we know what is the portion of ſuch—they ſhall have their part taken out of the book of life, out of the holy city, and out of the bleſſings written in the goſpel. And they who add their own imaginations to things writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Bible, God ſhall add to them the plagues writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the holy book. Rev. xxii 18—19. Nay,</p>
               <p>GOD has expreſsly and repeatedly declared, That this burning fire <hi>never ſhall be quenched.</hi> Mark, ix. 43, 44, 55, 48. alſo, Iſaiah lxvi 24. In all which paſſages the immortality of the worm, and the unquenchableneſs of the fire, are exact parrellels, which is inconſiſtent with ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all, and with any diſcharge from puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. If ſin in veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, is quite connatural to them, then either they muſt be converted in Hell, or never be diſcharged from it: but converſion is a work of grace any where, and no ſuch diſplay of grace, can at all be expected, but according to the words of grace, in the Bible; but there is not one word in the Bible, about diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing ſuch grace in Hell. Therefore there never will be any diſcharge from that ſtate of puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="10">X. If it is neceſſary for the glory of God that any ſhould be puniſhed with deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, according to II. Theſſ. i. 19. then it is at leaſt, equally

               <p n="1">1. The word of inſpiration in this text is <hi>aioonion,</hi> which, as has been proved, is genuine evidence, that the judgment of God is, that it ſhould be everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every reaſon for puniſhing any with deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord at all, makes it at leaſt, as neceſſary to continue the ſame execution forever, if the execution of this puniſhment at firſt, was neceſſary as a reward of evil deeds, then as long as evil deeds continue, the reaſon of this execution continues. But there can be none but evil deeds in Hell; therefore the reaſon of that puniſhment can never ceaſe. If this puniſhment was inflicted at firſt, in honor to divine juſtice, then as long as divine juſtice remains the ſame, ſo long the reaſon for this puniniſhment remains. If this execution was made at firſt to teſtify Gods abhorrence of ſin, then as long as that abhorrence remains, this execution muſt remain. God, right, and the moral nature of things, never change: whatever therefore, in the nature of God, of right, or of morality, induced and juſtified the firſt executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this caſe, will at leaſt, juſtify it forever. <hi>I I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can be made from this argument, but that the damned, will in ſome period of their miſery ceaſe from ſinning, and ſo may be diſcharged. Againſt which ſuppoſition the following things lie, viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such ſuppoſed ceſſation from ſinning muſt be from a motive <hi>ab <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tra,</hi> or <hi>ab extra, from within, or from without</hi>; from within, it cannot derive without a new heart, and there is not one indication in the word of God, or nature of things, that a new heart will be given in hell, if there was, the neareſt proſpect of good to ſome men, would be their ſpeedy arrival among the damned; and from without, this ſuppoſed ceſſation from ſinning cannot derive: both becauſe the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of redemption are peculiar to this life, according to the Bible; and becauſe the wrath of God, and nothing elſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed reſpecting the damned; and laſtly, becauſe the oath of an unchanging God barrs all hope, Heb. iii. 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another thing which lies againſt the above ſuppoſition is, their old ſinful habits having full poſſeſſion of their nature,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:017812_0037_0FA31B2D82CFBDE8"/>
muſt continue, while that endures; alſo their old ſins, having in their nature eternal demerit neceſſarily bind to an eternity of ſuffering. The intrinſic malignity of all ſin is meaſured, by the revealed dignity of its object. An offence committed againſt the known authority, and dignity of a prince, by his ſubject, differs vaſtly in its intrinſic malignity and demerit, from that of the ſame action materially againſt a peaſant. As much groſſer is the caſe before us, as God is above a fellow ſinner; now this difference is in all views quite infinite. Such therefore is the demerit of all ſins againſt God, and how ſhould the ſubject poſſibly open a new account, while the old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains neceſſarily unballanced.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The very nature of all diſappointed, diſpleaſed and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented ſpirits, is ſelf-vindication, ſelf-excuſing, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive accuſing allegations againſt the ſource of their trouble. This is obvious both to obſervation and ſenſation; but all this is eſſentially ſin, and wickedneſs againſt God; yet ſuch ſin and wickedneſs muſt from the nature of the caſe, eternally employ the damned, without exception of one ſenſation, or act of volition; till they become cordially pleaſed with the pains of damnation, and if this is perfectly impoſſible, then it is equally ſo, that ſuch ſin and wickedneſs ſhould ceaſe, or their conſequently deſerved puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. If eternity of puniſhment, on ſuppoſition of its certainty, is an infinite good in the intelligent ſyſtem; then to deny the eternity of puniſhment, is to deny what is an infinite good in the intelligent ſyſtem. But an eternity of puniſhment, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be certain, is an infinite good in the intelligent ſyſtem. Therefore to deny the eternity of future puniſhment, is to deny what is an infinite good in the intelligent ſyſtem. Now that future eternal puniſhment is ſuch infinite good, ſhall be proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If for thinking beings, ſubjects of a ſupreme perfect government, to be made circumſtantially acquainted with, and well aſſured of the mind of their Supreme, and the deſigns of his government is an infinite priviledge; and an infinite priviledge is an infinite good; then the conſequence avails: But for ſuch ſubjects to be ſo informed and aſſured of the mind and deſigns of their Supreme, is an infinite priviledge, and ſuch priviledge is an infinite good: Therefore future eternal puniſhment is an infinite good in the intelligent ſyſtem. So that if it was not made certain, 'tis moſt deſirable that it ſhould be ſo. But a belief of divine perfections, and that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:017812_0038_0FA31B2E43ACCBC0"/>
his government, and whole plan, are juſt like himſelf, in propriety and righteouſneſs, implies a belief, that every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable and perfect good for his ſyſtem is contained in it; and that for ſuch ſubjects to be ſo made acquainted with, and aſſured of the mind and deſigns of their Supreme, and of his univerſal dominion, is a priviledge, will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; nor will any deny it to be an infinite priviledge, who believe ſuch Supreme to be infinite in all views, and who believe the nature and deſign of his government to be of infinite importance to the ſubjects of it. And doubtleſs the ſame light will determine all who have it, that ſuch an infinite priviledge is an infinite good. But then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that future eternal puniſhment is an infinite good, in the intelligent ſyſtem, as plainly as either the nature and reaſon of the caſe, make it evident to be true; or as the word of GOD ſhews it to be certainly a part of his plan. Both which have been proved already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which has infinite weight, from its own nature, to prevent infinite evil, both moral and penal, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and urge infinite good, both ſubjectivly and objectiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to entelligent creatures, is itſelf an infinite good to them: But the conſideration of future eternal puniſhment, is from its own nature, of ſuch infinite weight; therefore it is an infinite good to ſuch creatures. For it is an argument of infinite weight againſt all ſin and its conſequence; and for all good and happineſs forever. Conſequently thoſe who deny it, remove a mean of infinite weight, for the good of mankind and the glory of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If future eternal puniſhment has influence to the honor of God, and of all divine objects; it is an infinite good; but the former is true; therefore ſuch puniſhment is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite good in the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an everlaſting monumental evidence, that there is no unrighteouſneſs in God. And that which ſupports the honor of infinite righteousneſs, truth, and goodneſs, is itſelf, for that reaſon, infinitely good. God has well informed men of the nature and demerit of ſin; and has given aſſurance that in caſe of diſobedience, he would aſſign them, to this very puniſhment; which is therefore the proof in fact, that "juſt and right is <hi>be.</hi>" Whereas the denial, and removal of this evidence, caſts the reproach of falſhood, and deluſion on the nature, name and word of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:017812_0039_0FA31B2F03A5A3B8"/>2. Everlaſting puniſhment reflects honor on the laws of God. It is penalty ſupports the honor of all laws. Divine laws being infinite in all views, their honor can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by nothing leſs than puniſhment anſwerable to their nature.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It reflects light on the nature, and ſhews the reaſon, of ſuch chriſtian atonement as the Bible diſcribes. The a toner being of infinite dignity, could not be ſubjected to ſuch ſufferings, but on that ſuppoſition of the infinite deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſin, which is the neceſſary implication of eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; That one who was God-man muſt endure as Jeſus Chriſt did, has the ſelf-ſame occaſional reaſon, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal puniſhment has. They reflect light on each other, and doubtleſs muſt ſtand and fall together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Eternal puniſhment reflects ſuch an honor on that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law, whoſe penalty is there executed, as it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould have on any other ſuppoſition. It ſpeake that law, whoſe penalty it is, to be infinite in excellency. Whereas a ſmall or temporary puniſhment, degrades the law, whoſe penalty it is. Therefore we ſee every mitigation of future puniſhment, relaxeth moral bonds.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Therefore without this doctrine of future eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; the honor of all divine attributes, the value of the atonement, the dignity of the holy law, the truth of the Bible; all fail, and are depreciated. And if the mean of all theſe infinite honors is an infinite good, in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſyſtem; then eternal puniſhment is an infinite good in the moral ſyſtem.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The ſcriptural notion of future puniſhment, juſtifies, and honors the faith, hope and conduct of all true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Their faith was founded in what they ſaw in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; this gave ſpring to their hope, and holy lives, and ſufferings. If the Bible is never honored with this future execution; it infinitely weakens and diſhonors all their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For one reaſon of their religion was a refuge from that eternal ſtorm. Heb. vi. 18. Iſaiah xxv. 4.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The honor of Jeſus Chriſt's ſaviourſhip in part depends on the reallity of eternal puniſhment. For ſalvation always reſpects the evil from which, as well as the good to which it is affected. Conſequently as much as is taken from the eternity of future puniſhment, juſt ſo much is taken from the glory of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt. For only by him are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſaved from the wrath to come. I. Theſſ. i. 10.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:017812_0040_0FA31B2FC3A0E4E0"/>8 Future puniſhment is the foil to ſet of off diſtinguiſhing grace to thoſe who are ſaved; gives reaſon for, and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the ſongs of ſuch, in praiſe of God and the Lamb; and it will be as neceſſary in all future periods of eternity, as it was at firſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It is the truth and certainty of eternal puniſhment, which emphatically gives character to God, as a righteous judge; and gives weight, to and ſupports his revealed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about the nature and difference of ſin and holineſs. Conſequently,</p>
               <p n="10">10. As it will be equally neceſſary, that all theſe purpoſes ſhould be ſerved in all periods of eternity, as at any of them; ſo the ſame reaſon which juſtifies damnation at all, will equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove the neceſſity of its eternity.</p>
               <p n="11">11. And as each, and every one of theſe purpoſes ſerved by eternal future puniſhment, is a good of infinite value; ſo it is evident that future eternal puniſhment is an infinite good; in the intelligent ſyſtem.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Nay more, for as innumerable infinite goods, muſt be of more worth and value than all the loſes ſuſtained by a finite number of finite creatures, in that future puniſhment; ſo that future puniſhment, muſt on the whole, be a pure, and abſtract good, a moſt rational and worthy object of joy and praiſe, for the intelligent ſyſtem, and ſo we are arrived exactly at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teſtimony. Rev. xvi. 5. "thou art righteous O Lord, who art and waſt and ſhall be becauſe thou haſt judged thus". And now we may underſtand the cxxxvi Pſalm, 10.14.17.18.19.20. as a ſong of praiſe for penal execution, and each aſcribed to mercy, and that as a reaſon which endures forever, to which therefore all muſt concur who love mercy. And therefore reſpecting ſuch as do not ſo concur, God will be juſtified when he ſpeaks, and clear when he judgeth, Pſalm, lvii, 4.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The twelfth ſentiment evidential of eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, it is probable the damned would rather chuſe, on their own principles, continuance in their ſtate, than the company and employments of the beatific viſion, if they had opportunity of free choice. This in ſome meaſure appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Becauſe the devil, who loves eaſe, honor and happineſs, as well as any; when he had opportunity of free converſation with his judge, as in the caſe of Job. Job, i. 6. &amp;c. And alſo in the affair of Ahab, I. Kings, xxii. 21.22. And of Jeſus Chriſt, whom ſatan knew to be his ſovereign. Mat. iv. 3. &amp;c.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:017812_0041_0FA31B3086D28560"/>
He never moved one word, for a reverſion of the decree of his puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The natural averſion of ſinful men to all holy objects, which in the Bible is called enmity; is ſuch, as doubtleſs render the ſtate of the damned, more conſonant to the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, of thoſe who are in it; than the immediate glory of God, and the holy world would be death and damnation, make no moral alterations in the ſubjects; and the ſame diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of heart; which makes averſion to all holy objects here, no doubt operates according to its nature there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When Dives, one of the damned, had opportunity of free converſation with Abraham, a fellow man; he offered not one word, for a place in Abraham's boſom: he only wanted ſome mitigation of miſery, in his own ſituation.</p>
               <p>But as the device of ſalvation for all men, excludes the noted doctrine of election; it is neceſſary a teſtimony ſhould here be given to the truth of this doctrine of God. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. If God has choſen a number of perſons out of the body of mankind, to be ſaved, then all mankind will not be ſaved: But God has choſen a number out of mankind to be ſaved; therefore all men will not be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Election is thus deſcribed, <hi>ex omnibus Electio ad ſalutem,</hi> i. e. a chooſing ſome out of all, to ſalvation. So Peter writing to the believing ſtrangers, I. Pet. i. 2. ſays "they were elect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the foreknowledge of God". And Paul ſaith, Rom. xi. 5. "there was a remnant in his time, anſwerable to Elijah's ſeven thouſand, according to the election of grace", and he ſaith of the Theſſalonian church, "God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation," Jeſus Chriſt ſaith of his followers, "I have choſen you out of the world." There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rom. xi. 5. he ſaith, "the election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded," but "as many as were ordained to eternal life believed." Acts xiii. 48. but though it is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ſuch evidence, to urge it on ſuch as are not influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by ſcriptural authority; yet for the ſake of ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the judgment of God, a few more evidences may be given to this eſſential article in the divine ſyſtem.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If the ſcriptures are the infallible word of God, and do affirm the doctrine of election, in the ſenſe above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, then this doctrine muſt be believed at infinite peril<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But that the ſcriptures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e the word of God, is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and that they do affirm this doctrine, of God's chooſing

ſome of mankind to ſalvation, and that therefore all men cannot be ſaved, has already been proved, and ſhall be made further evident; therefore this doctrine muſt be believed, at the peril of giving the lie to God and the Bible, and that in a multitude of inſtances. So at the period of this world, when thoſe who are heirs of glory, are to be received to that poſſeſſion, the account of it, which is perfectly right, ſaith, Mat. xxiv. 31. "He ſhall ſend his angels, and they ſhall gather together his elect, from the four winds." And of theſe God has declared, I. Theſſ. v ix. "That he has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt." And there are about a ſcore of inſtances in the Bible wherein ſome form of the word ELECT is uſed to the ſame purpoſe; and conſequently ſo many evidences, quite incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible againſt the device of Salvation for all men. And twice that number of texts, wherein ſome form of the word CHOSEN is uſed to the ſame purpoſe; each determining the truth and right of the doctrine of election in the above ſenſe. Beſides a number of inſtances, wherein the word AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POINT in ſome of its forms, is uſed, as indicative of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, and to the ſame purpoſe. Alſo a number of texts might be named, wherein the word <hi>ordained</hi> is uſed to the ſame purpoſe. As Acts xiii. 48. forenamed, "as many as were ordained to eternal life believed." And about fifty paſſages of ſcripture, indicate the ſame ſovereignty, and to the ſame purpoſe, by the expreſſion <hi>I will</hi> and the like, as to the diſplay of diſtinguiſhing grace among men, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing final ſalvation. As Exod. xxxiii. 19. "I will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to whom I will be gracious; and I will ſhew mercy, on whom I will ſhew mercy." So Iſaiah lviii. 8. "With everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy redeemer." And Rom. ix. 16. "It is not of him who willeth, nor of him who runeth, but of God who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy."</p>
               <p>But becauſe a number of objections, againſt this hated diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of the divine nature, ſeem plauſible to the inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate. A very brief hint of reply may be given to ſome of them.</p>
               <p>Obj. 1. But this does not agree with that love which God has for men in common.</p>
               <p>Anſ. No ſcripture implies that God has <hi>ſaving Love</hi> for mankind in common. Many ſcriptures which are perverted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

to have no ſuch import. But God, as the God of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth ſo love men in common, as to ſend his own ſon in their nature, to ſet an example for them all; and to make actual and perfect atonement, for ſuch of them, as it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to give him, in the covenant of redemption. He doth ſo love them in common, as to give them being, life, breath, and all the mercies they enjoy. "He maketh his ſun to riſe on the evil and on the good; and ſendeth rain on the juſt, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the unjuſt. And ſo his tender mercies are on them all.</p>
               <p>Obj. 2. This makes God a reſpector of perſons, which is contrary to Acts x. 34.</p>
               <p>Anſ. No perſonal conſideration at all, commends any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to the grace of God; he neither loves or hates any, becauſe they are black or white, Jew or Greek, rich or poor, or for any thing elſe merely perſonal. "Not for your ſakes, do I this, ſaith the Lord God, be it known to you." Ezek. xxxvi. 32. Saving grace is all for Chriſt's ſake, not for ours.</p>
               <p>Obj. 3. Then there is need of good works.</p>
               <p>Anſ. And art thou one of thoſe who expect to be ſaved by good works? No works of ours are the means, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of election, or conſequent ſalvation. Thoſe who are ſaved are elected to do good works, as much as to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as an evidence of their title to it, and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for it. "They are choſen to ſalvation through ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth." II. Theſſ. ii. 13.</p>
               <p>Obj. 4. But the threatnings of the law are made in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all.</p>
               <p>Anſ. They be ſo, as a mean to make them ſee their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and need of a ſaviour, and "they that hear ſhall live." John v. 25. This is a mean eſtabliſhed to bring about the end and deſign of election.</p>

               <p>Anſ. It is not true. The firſt object of deſign with God, in all his works is, "to make his name known in all the earth."

held faſt is a certain mean of deſtruction. "The ways of ſin are death." Rom. vi. 23. But damnation of men never was the leading object of deſign with God. He cannot have taſte for that object in itſelf. Yet he delights to glorify his juſtice, on thoſe who have abuſed his meaſure. "Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who ſhould betray him." John vi. 64.</p>
               <p>Obj. 6. But the doctrine of election tends to relax the bonds of morality.</p>
               <p>Anſ. All men are bound to holineſs, both in principle and practice; and theſe bonds cannot be relaxed, but by choice of their ſubject. And what ſuch ſubject knows not can give no juſt cauſe to ſuch choice; but no man knows the object of election; till he finds Jeſus Chriſt is the object of his own election. And that his own principle prevents remiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to holineſs.</p>
               <p>Obj. 7. But abſolute election renders means of grace uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
               <p>Anſ. If by means of grace is meant any thing in this world ſufficient of itſelf to give grace; it is as wide from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as the denial of election. But if the objection deſigns means appointed and uſed by God to beget grace; it is moſt injudicious. How ſhould God's chuſing ſome to ſalvation, hinder his beſtowing grace on them? No man ever was choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en immediately to ſalvation; election is immediately to the priviledge of divine inſtitutions; and ſo to the bleſſing of God attending them, and ſo to ſalvation following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. II. Theſſ. ii. 13. "God hath choſen you to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth."</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the doctrine of election is neceſſary to the honour of all divine perfections, then it ought to have a place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong eternal truths, but the former is true, therefore the letter muſt be allowed. A few things muſt be premiſed to clear the truth of this hypotheſis.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Jeſus Chriſt was deſigned from eternity to the office of redeemer of ſinners, this will be allowed, and this is the reaſon why he is called "the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the word." Rev. xiii. 8. To this end was he "foreordained, before the foundation of the world." I. Peter i. 20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of redemption intentionally paid by him then, was infinitely great and valuable. This alſo will be allowed.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:017812_0045_0FA31B339ED708E8"/>3. That the moving reaſon of all this was THE WILL OF GOD. Therefore ſaid Pſalm xl. 7, 8. "Lo I come, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to do thy will, O my God." And John x. 18. I lay down my life, this commandment have I received of my Father.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then it became neceſſary for the honor of all divine perfections, that his reward ſhould be aſſigned him, by the ſame ſovereign will, and made infallibly ſecure, that he might know certainly what he ſhould have, for the travail of his ſoul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The honor of divine juſtice became intereſted, in Chriſt's having a reward aſſigned him, and this made infallibly cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. For it is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ule of natural righteouſneſs, "the labourer is worthy of his hire," Luke x. 7. but how this coſtly attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ſucceed, or whether it ſhould certainly ſucceed at all, could not be made quite certain to Jeſus Chriſt, but by an abſolute determination or decree, wherein God pledgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the redeemer, to cauſe to be effectuated ſuch ſucceſs and reward infallibly. There is nothing in all exiſtence abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely infallible but God. The reaſon of this caſe demanded infallibility of ſecurity to Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore Rom. v. viii. 29. ſpeaks in this manner, he did Predeſtinate, or abſolutely decree and appoint, thoſe whom he foreknew, to be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the image of his ſon; that he, i. e. Chriſt, might be quite ſure that he ſhould be the firſt born among many bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. therefore it is ſaid, in Gal. iii. 17. that the law could not diſannul the covenant which was confimed before of God in Chriſt, and Iſaiah deſcribes this righteous ſettlement thus, Iſa, liii 10. "when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed", and when all this is fulfilled in fact, then juſtice is honored, for God the father has dealt juſtly by his ſuffering ſon.</p>
               <p>Obj. But we make this reward the greater, and more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, by excluding election; and allowing the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane race to Chriſt, inſtead of an elect number.</p>
               <p>Anſ. That is no honor at all, but an infinite reproach, which advanceth one attribute of God, at the expence, and infinite diſhonor of another. Righteouſneſs and juſtice are attributes of God, immediately diſhonored by ſin, and they have a prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry demand for reparation of honors; but in the device of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for all men no equal monument of honor, to theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attributes is allowed at all.</p>
               <p>It is indeed ſaid, that Jeſus Chriſt ſupplied this defect, by equal honors to thoſe divine attributes, but we all know that
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:017812_0046_0FA31B3442BBBCD0"/>
no man knows any thing at all about this affair but what he finds in the Bible, we alſo equally know not only that the Bible ſays no ſuch thing, but affirms, and uniformly maintains the reverſe, viz. that Jeſus Chriſt did not make his ſoul an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for all ſinners, as has been proved, but for thoſe only whom God had choſen, or elected in Chriſt, according to Eph. i. 4. therefore Rev. xiv. 4. ſaith, "theſe are they which follow the Lamb; theſe were redeemed from among men," conſequently no attonement was actually made ſo the reſt of mankind; therefore u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ppeaſed wrath impends him ſtill; and eternal puniſhment is prepared for them, as has been proved already.</p>
               <p>So that the denial of the doctrine of election, implies infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſhonor to the righteouſneſs of God; which can be ſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no way but on the avowed principle of the bible, viz. that Jeſus Chriſt did perfect honor to inju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed juſtice, by an equal attonement, for all who were given him, by the father in the covenant of redemption; and the ſame divine attribute is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored, as to all others by infliction of the penalty always ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the breach of the law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So alſo the mercy of God is honored by the doctrine of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Therefore on the plan of the Bible, which always implies this doctrine, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xxxv Pſalm, 10. v. ſays, "mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and truth are met together: righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other." And this in conſequence of the ſalvation wrought out by Chriſt, named in the foregoing 9. v. And on the ſame account the Apoſtle ſaith, Eph. i. 4.5.6. that God's having predeſtinated thoſe whom he had choſen, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in Chriſt, to the adoption of children, by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will, is to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, and the ſame Apoſtle teacheth Rom. ix. 23. that "the riches of his glory are made known, on the veſſels of mercy afore prepared unto glory." Nay mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is eminently honored by election, two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe mercy, love, and goodwill to men, are the ſource of it. Therefore the Apoſtle aſcribes election, which is according to the fore-knowledge of God the father, to the abundance of his mercy, I, Pet. 1.2.3. ſo it is called electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace, or mere mercy, Rom. xi. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe abounding mercy is the effect and conſequence of election, "he hath choſen you to ſalvation;" and to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and faith, as the only way to that ſalvation. II. Theſſ. ii. 13. they who are elected, "have grace and peace multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:017812_0047_0FA31B3504022F20"/>
to them," I. Pet. i. 2. election infallibly iſſues in "a lively hope, of the inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in heaven for them," I. Pet. i. 4. and they are ſurely "kept by the power of God, through ſaith to that ſalvation," 5. v. but for men to aſcibe to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the ſalvation of all men, without any warrant from God, is ſuch a diſhonor to the mercy of God, as weakens the ſcriptural teſtimony about it; and deſtroys the ground and reaſon of chriſtian confidence in it; becauſe of courſe, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is not to be depended on about it. The like might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of every other attribute of God.</p>
               <p>So it appears that it was neceſſary there ſhould be an election of ſome to eternal life, that Jeſus Chriſt might have infallible aſſurance of ſeeing the travail of his ſoul, and of being ſatisfied, that as many as were given him, in that inflexible decree, ſhould certainly be with him, to behold his glory, and ſhout his praiſe forever and ever. And it was neceſſary as an infallible ground of aſſurance and certainty, that every attribute of God, ſhould be ſeen and held, honorable and glorious forever. For nothing at all, in a ſcheme of favor to ſinners, can be an infallible ground of certainty, but a decree of God. Nor any thing make the import of ſuch decree publickly <hi>certain,</hi> but proper aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that it derives from the inflexible, and rightfully ſovereign WILL OF GOD: having in view the glory of all his attributes, and the infallible diſplay of infinite mercy in the ſalvation of ſome ſinners; which indeed, as the caſe is, is a number paſt all numbering, "which no man can num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Rev. vii. 9.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. If the doctrine of ſalvation for all men, and ſo of courſe, the excluſion of the divine doctrine of gracious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, imports a ſuppoſition of the natural ſufficiency of the will of man, to any good work; then that doctrine of ſalvation for all men, with its conſequent implications, is to be avoided, with moſt ſerious deteſtation. Some reaſon for this concluſion ſhall be given.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The doctrine of ſalvation for all men, implying as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſuppoſed, is certainly inconſiſtent with the evidences of the mind and will of God, above-cited; and with innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable others; a ſpecimen of which now follows, II. John, ix. 10.11. "whoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God: he that abideth in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt, hath both the Father and the Son. If there
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:017812_0048_0FA31B35C4911CF8"/>
come any to you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe; neither bid him God ſpeed, for he that bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him God ſpeed, is partaker of his evil deeds." The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital idea in this paſſage of ſcripture, is in the word "tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſeth." Some evidence of its ſenſe and pertinency in this caſe, muſt be added.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This word in the original is <hi>Parahainoon, Eraſmus</hi> renders its theme by <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The word of inſpiration rendered "a bideth" in this text is <hi>menoon,</hi> Leigh's crit. ſac. ſays it ſignifieth, <hi>Conſtantiam, et penitiſsiman Inheſionem,</hi> a conſtant and moſt deep inheſion in the doctrine of Chriſt, implying that all who do not ſo, are to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided by this command of God, on its own fearful penalty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The above mentioned word rendered "tranſgreſſeth," is uſed Mat. xv. 3. to ſignify making void, or ſetting aſide, the doctrine, or commandments of God, by mere devices of men, ſuch therefore as do ſo, we are warned againſt in this text,</p>
               <p n="4">4. The margin of the Bible refers the reader to I. Cor. v. 11. as of a parrellel nature and importance, but there the counſel ſubjoined is; "with ſuch an one no not to eat." It alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to I. Cor. xvi. 22. which is, "if any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt;" of which his principles and practice muſt be evidence, "let him be an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other goſpel to you, than that we have preached to you, let him be accurſed," and to ſhew how much God himſelf inſiſted on keeping the entire ſyſtem of the goſpel uncorrupted: it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated again in the next verſe, "let him be accurſed."</p>
               <p>Indeed the author of the Bible, ſo well knew its perfection as a ſyſtem: and the moſt important neceſſity, of it, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved pure, and conſidered as a perfect teſt of Right; both in things to be believed, and in things to be done; that though he approved the Church of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="49" facs="unknown:017812_0049_0FA31B368533E4D8"/>
which admoniſheth all people, as they fear God, and would be conformed to his perfect ſyſtem, and ſo be acceptable to him; that they avoid and oppoſe a ſett of notions, ſo palpably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the whole Bible as this of ſalvation for all men, with its appendages, have been proved to be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The doctrine of ſalvation for all men is an open affront to the letter, as well as evident meaning of plain ſcripture. The Bible aſſures us, that God of his abounding grace, deſigned ſome, yea, many of the fallen race of men to ſalvation, by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and gave them to him for that purpoſe, and theſe are they for whom he made ſatisfaction; which is the plain ſenſe of the following expreſſions of the mind of God. viz. John xvii. 6. &amp;c. "I have manifeſted thy name to the men whom thou gaveſt me out of the world, thine they were and thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt them me, I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. For their ſakes I ſanctify my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that they alſo may be ſanctified through the truth." John xviii. 9. "Of them which thou gaveſt me, I have loſt none." John i. 12. "To as many as received him, to them gave he power to be ſons of God." John iii. 16. "That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh." John x. 29. "My Father who gave them me, is greater than all." John vi. 39. "And his will is, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing." The apoſtle's object was "to ſave ſome." "All men have not faith." II. Theſſ. iii. 3. The flock of God is "a little flock." Yet it is "the pleaſure of God to give them the kingdom." Luke xii. 32. Only they who have part in the firſt reſurrection, are written in the Lamb's book of life. Rev. xiii. 8.20.6. Only thoſe "whom he fore-knew did he predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his ſon." Rom. viii. 29. Spiritual bleſſings are peculiar to ſuch as are choſen in Chriſt; they only being predeſtinated to the adoption of children. Eph. i. 3.4.5. Theſe are the elected, or choſen generation; the purchaſed people I. Pet. ii. 9. 'In no wiſe ſhall any enter into the kingdom of heaven, but they who are written in the Lamb's book of life." Rev. xxi. 27.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The doctrine of ſalvation for all men, tends to deceive multitudes with hopes of ſalvation, to whom God has given no hopes of it. For only ſuch as believe and are conformed
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:017812_0050_0FA31B3742B93078"/>
to the Bible, can have ſalvation. Mark xvi. 16. "To every ſoul of them who obey unrighteouſneſs, ſhall be rendered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and wrath." Rom. ii. 8, 9. "The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, with all the nations who forget God. Pſal. ix. 17. Be not deceived, the unrighteous ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom of God. I. Cor. vi. 9. And the holy book abounds with ſuch ſentences. To all which, the device of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for all men, is a moſt daring; oppoſition; and the faireſt way to ſupport a pretence of this device, is to deny the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Bible. And after Deiſm, the road is open to Atheiſm, and either of theſe will decide the point, who ſhall be ſaved and who not. But 'tis affecting to conſider multitudes, without any qualifications for future happineſs, pacifying their conſciences with this, that ſome men, and perhaps, becauſe of advantage, they call them great and good, affirm that Chriſt died for all, and of co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that all ſhall be ſaved. So becauſe this better pleaſeth a ſlothful wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart, they turn a deaf ear to the bible, and to all who urge its contents, for they cannot hold both to be true, ſince they are directly oppoſite to each other. And as God will not beſtow ſalvation in a way diſhonorable to Jeſus Chriſt and the Bible, ſo all ſuch muſt periſh.</p>
               <p>Hoping what has been offered on the foregoing topics, may excite ſome hand more at leiſure, and better furniſhed to do them juſtice; a few corollaries will conclude the whole.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The doctrine of election has divine authority, i. e. abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute aſſurance was given to the redeemer, for whom, and how many, he ſhould make ſatisfaction to divine juſtice, which number of mankind being as has been ſhewn quite numberleſs; is in the ſcripture called the Lord's inheritance; his people, his portion, heritage &amp;c. which being choſen for his part, he will never leave nor forſake. Heb. xiii. 5. to theſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is ſecured by covenant. Heb. ix. 15. and it muſt be high arrogance to aſſign to that kingdom any among men, not quallified according to charter, and who cannot be named in the LAMB's book of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then the great God is abſolute ſovereign; and it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to do what he will with his own. Mat. xx. 15, all mankind were his ſole property: and he dealt bountifully with them. They have gone aſtray, and waſted his goods; though
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:017812_0051_0FA31B3805265C00"/>
he had given them a ſummary of his law, by which they knew, the demerit of ſin was death in all ſenſes. Now all their goods are forfeited; and they have no claim, but execution of penalty. Yet this was the time of love, he paſſed by, and ſaid to his Jeruſalem, as a type of his elect, LIVE. Ezek. xvi. 6. and when he ſaw there was none to ſave them, his own arm brought ſalvation, he ſaid, "I will redeem them from death." Hoſ. xiii. 14. and as the ſource of this hope, was the mere benevolence of God, ſo when he had glorified himſelf in ſuch a purpoſe; he held himſelf obliged to glorify himſelf again in an anſwerable accompliſhment. John xii. 28.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To what purpoſe then can it be, to palm on him, a more extenſive inheritance, among men, than he who is Lord of all, choſe for that purpoſe? Eſpecially as no manner of title can be given, for want of authority. Will he thank them for it? ſurely no. Will he not rather reprove them, and ſet theſe things in dreadful order before their eyes? Pſalm l. 21.22.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then perfect righteouſneſs may be affirmed of every word, and every work of God. "He is a rock, his work is perfect, all his ways are judgment, a God of truth, and without ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity juſt and right is he." Deut. xxxii. 4. Therefore he curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them who pervert judgment. Deut. xxvii. 19. And will ſurely reprove them who deal deceitfully for him. Job xiii. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then it certainly becomes us, to regulate our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and conduct, exactly according to the determinations of his moſt perfect ſyſtem; for every deviation from it, will receive a juſt recompenſe of reward. Heb. ii. 2. Beſides, by this word ſhall we all be judged at the laſt day. For when the three books, which are the publick regiſters of the kingdom, ſhall be opened, of which the Bible is one; while omniſcience and conſcience, are the other two; all men will be judged out of the things written in theſe books; juſt as they have treated them. Rev. xx. 12. So it is the higheſt intereſt, as well as duty, of all men to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely, by the moſt legible of theſe books; the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For "it is a quick diſcerner of the thoughts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the heart." Heb. iv. 12.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:017812_0052_0FA31B38C2B88C68"/>6. By attention to the Bible we gain the reaſons, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced the divine mind, in concerting his plan, eſpecially as to his chuſing ſome of mankind, and not all to ſalvation, viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he might thereby eſtabliſh a witneſſing monument, of the righteous ſovereignty, of which he knew himſelf well poſſeſt; and which he knew it was beſt for men to know and revere. For he knew all men were his abſolute property; and that they were all bankrupts; having totally forfeited all good, and loſt all ground of claim to a reſtoration. He knew alſo that his juſtice was as honorable as his mercy; yea that both were alike honorable. And though he was under no bonds to ſhew mercy at all; yet ſuch is his benevolent nature, that mercy pleaſed him. But ſome of men, were due to his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, as a monument of its righteouſneſs. And the judge of all the earth muſt do right. Some ancient evidences of his righteous ſovereignty, are not to be diſputed. He defeated the councel of "AHITH<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>PHEL, to the intent that he might bring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel upon ABSALOM." II. Sam. xvii. 14. And did in fact give order in ſuch manner, as ſhould iſſue in the final blindneſs of many. Iſaiah vi. 9, 10. To this end he ſent ſtrong deluſions to ſome, that they might be damned. II. Theſſ. ii. 11, 12. So his righteouſneſs appears, in making the wicked for the day of evil. Prov. xvi. 4. And diſobedient ones were appointed to ſtumble at the word. I Pet. ii. 8. And ſome as natural brute beaſts made to be deſtroyed, ſhall utterly periſh. II. Pet. ii. 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he might make his grace appear as ſelf-ſufficient, in making ſalvation infallible ſure to ſome, who deſerved it no more than thoſe who were before ordained to damnation. Jud. iv. And to bind them, by the ſtrongeſt bonds to honor his laws, and praiſe his grace forever. And they will forever "ſing unto the Lord, becauſe he hath done marvelous things." Pſalm xcviii. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he might furniſh the <hi>Lapis lydius,</hi> or effectual touch-ſtone; by which to try the ſpirits of mankind. Men often ſay, "I go ſir." But when they find the evident drift of the Bible, is to exalt the Lord alone, and to humble the pride of all fleſh; then they turn back, and walk no more with it. They ſay theſe are hard ſayings; and they are offended. For "they are
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:017812_0053_0FA31B3984661D28"/>
lovers of their own ſelves." II. Tim. iii. 2. And cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure what God has given for ſound doctrine. II. Tim. iv. 3. And ſometimes they "ſhoot their arrows, even bitter words" againſt chriſtianity and turn Deiſts. And ſo make their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt to all men. II. Tim. iii. 9. But God "will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to every man according to his deeds." Rom. ii. 6.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Then to hold the ſalvation of all men, is no evidence of love either to God or man. It is no evidence of love to God, for love to God, always coincides with his written word. Therefore Chriſt ſays, "If ye love me, keep my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments." John xiv. 15. And "if any man love me, he will keep my words." John xiv. 23. Whereas the notion of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for all men, is not only no part of the word of God; but moſt palpably inconſiſtent with it, as has been proved.</p>
               <p>Nor doth this notion indicate love to man. For love to man never flatters them in ſin, never leads into ſnares in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgently; nor leaves them in evident danger. All which is true of encouragements of ſalvation to any, in a way di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to the word of God. For the conſtant man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the word of God, is to urge faith and holineſs, as the only ſupport of a hope of ſalvation, and to denounce dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to all deſtitute of theſe qualifications. Love ſeeks the good, not the harm of its object. Faith and holineſs are the honor, as well as happineſs of their ſubject. Theſe therefore are the firſt deſign of the Bible; and it gives aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance to the ſubjects of them be they otherwiſe who, and what they may; that they ſhall be happy forever. And there is no hope to any other; for "the wicked ſhall be turned into hell, with all the nations that forget God." Pſalm ix. 17.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Then it is the part of inhuman cruelty to flatter men with the hopes of heaven, in a way utterly inconſiſtent with the determined counſel of the God of heaven. And ſo in a way which muſt neceſſarily terminate in eternal miſery; from he nature of the caſe, as well as from the word of God. For ſin and guilt are the natural conſtituents of miſery. "Deceive not with thy lips," is an expreſs law of God. Prov. xxiv. 28. There is a word of doctrine by the ſlight and craftineſs of men, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Eph. iv. 14. There can be no peace to ſuch as take meaſures to deſtroy men. What peace had ZIMRI who ſlew his maſter?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:017812_0054_0FA31B3A42B78A98"/>The author therefore begs the liberty of a few words in friendly freedom with theſe men, who ſupport the doctrine of ſalvation for all men.</p>
               <p>Dear Sirs, You allow the Bible is the word of God; you make uſe of it as ſuch; you allow its authority is well eſtabliſhed. How can you fall to ſee the importance of its analogy, i. e. the conſiſtency of one part with another? God is one; and his ſyſtem is like himſelf. It is like the coat which Chriſt wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, without ſeam, woven throughout. You muſt have ſome difficulty to reconcile your views, with many parts of the ſcripture. How much ſafer would it be for you to ſuſpect a ſcheme of ſentiments, of which you muſt have the trouble of doubting whether it will be owned, or not, in the burning day? Than to run a preſumptious ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of the final diſpleaſure of your judge, for perverting his word, and for teaching men ſo. It is moſt certain that they who love his word in its moſt manifeſtly conſiſtent ſenſe, muſt have peace, the peace of God which paſſeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Their conſciouſneſs muſt happify them. But preſumers in divine matters, cannot have the witneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, that in uprightneſs and godly ſincerity, they hold their religious converſation. It will not do, to run riſques in matters of eternity. When our hearts are ſound in God's ſtatutes, they will feel bleſſedneſs. And God will love them who unfeignedly love his holy laws. God has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly communicated his mind to us in the ſcriptures as he thought beſt. Why are you not willing he ſhould judge for you in that matter: Since you allow the divinity of the ſyſtem? Our Saviour ſays, "if it were not ſo, I would have told you." John xiv. 2. His kindneſs and wiſdom certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerted the whole ſcheme of the Bible. Can you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on ſerious conſideration, that if he really intended the ſalvation of all men; he would not have told us ſo, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough? What could be his motive to conceal that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; when doubtleſs, if it was his mind, he could have made it quite indiſputable? He was certainly at liberty to ſay what he pleaſed about it. Why did he not ſay it, and ſay it always: that ſo important a matter, might be out of all doubt? But you ſee he has not. Was he uncertain about the mind of God, in that affair, himſelf? Surely not. Why
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:017812_0055_0FA31B3B04651B58"/>
did he not ſpeak out then? And not leave us ſo embarraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Whereas he has given us one conciſe emphatical counſel; which if duly attended to, would relieve us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, viz. John v. 39. "Search the ſcriptures they are they which teſtify of me." The word rendered <hi>ſearch</hi> is <hi>ereunate</hi>; its theme is rendered by <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or</hi>; pleaſe to admit a few words from the noted Mr. PERKINS on the import of this word. Leigh's Crit. Sac. in Verb. He ſays, "the word is Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical, taken from ſuch as ſearch in mines, for ſilver and gold. They will dig deep, they will break the ſeveral clods of earth to pieces, to find the golden o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. Thus muſt we deal with the ſcripture. Search as we would for gold, or ſome precious thing, which we would fain find." Prov. ii. 4. "Search. i. e. ſhake and lift them, as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies. Search narrowly, till the true force and meaning, of every ſentence; yea of every word and ſyllable, nay of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very letter and iota therein, is known and underſtood; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare place with place, the ſcope of one place, with the ſcope of another. Things going before, with what comes after, yea compare word with word, letter with letter; and ſo ſearch it throughly." Thus he. And is not divine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel worth this pain? Is not our own information, peace, and eternal intereſt worth it? Would not all this labour be well repaid, if by that mean, we got evidence of the mind of God? Well, he has ſaid "then ſhall we know, when we follow on to know the Lord." Hoſ. vi. 3. And doubtleſs giving good heed to theſe counſels, would prevent much darkneſs and trouble; and ſecure us from many dangerous ſentiments and practices. Beſides, you are ſenſible, my friends; that you are ſomewhat unhappy, not only by the diſſention of many from you; but for want of ſome more clear and convincing ſcripture light, in your favor. And becauſe you are ſenſible there is ſome appearance of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt you in the Bible. Now what if through im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, or ſomething; for you know you are not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: it ſhould appear at the laſt day, that you was utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtaken; for God will have his own way, for all you, or me? And it is certainly reaſonable to call it in queſtion. If ſo, he will probably ſay, ſomething like this; I told you, on the whole plainly enough; my people in generations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, underſtood it well. But you precipitately made
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:017812_0056_0FA31B3BC4762A88"/>
your own concluſions; you ſaid, I would ſave all men, but I did not tell you ſo; and you know I told you many things in my word, quite inconſiſtent with it: but you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly kept your own ſentiment about it. And now ſee the crouds yonder, who were made ſecure in ſin by your doctrine; pleaſing themſelves that all would be ſaved, and ſo they were ſafe. And now their day is over; I have dealt with them, juſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> I told you, and them, that I would. They came here in their ſins, and I have baniſhed them to hopeleſs chains forever and ever: according to the plain word of the Bible. And now as judge, and righteous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger, I require the blood of all that multitude, at your hands, who were the means of their deſtruction. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thought is ſhocking! And it is no mark of an honeſt heart, to ſlight a hint of ſuch importance. It is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary that this matter be ſettled happily in a find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time; before diſpair ſhall render it uſeleſs.</p>
