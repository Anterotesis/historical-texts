         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My COUNTRYMEN and BRETHERN,</salute>

            <p>MUST America be the unhappy people, as it were, the Jews raiſed from the dead to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the ſame wickedneſs over again, but under greater light, that our ruin in the end may be ſtill more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, and our condemnation, like that of Capernaum at the day of judgment, be ſeven fold enhanced!</p>
            <p>WE ſee that while the calls of GOD to repentance wax louder, the cry of our ſabbath-breaking, ſwearing, uncleaneſs, and many other ſins, waxes louder and louder, and like the cry of Sodom comes up before GOD: And HE is now come down in his righteous judgment among us, and pleads againſt us, for the abuſes we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to his bleeding Son, who is crucified in every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart.</p>
            <p>WHAT ſhall we do? We cannot ſtand before his anger! Shall duſt magnify itſelf againſt him that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thereon? Or the chaff againſt the wind? Or the dry ſtubble againſt the raging flames?</p>
            <p>LET us then, every family and every perſon, mourn apart for our ſins. Let each one, with himſelf, cry 
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:043342_0003_101D041F08D477B0"/>
Alas! Alas for my ſins!—How much have I done to pull down the judgments of GOD upon the land!—O how did I ſin!—How was my ſin aggravated!—How did I ſin wilfully!—Againſt my own conſcience, againſt examples, againſt many warnings and admonitions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mercies and againſt judgments, and after vows made in ſickneſs and in danger; how have I reſtrained prayer, abuſed ſabbaths, neglected GOD's word, diſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his people, pierced his Son and grieved his Holy Spirlt! Oh! How have I obſerved lying vanities and forſaken mine own mercies!</p>
            <p>LET conſcience, ſhe is one of thy beſt friends, let conſcience now have full ſcope, and range with freedom through all thy life, and bring up every ſin, and place it before thee in its blackeſt colours, as it would appear to thee if thou wer't now upon thy death bed.</p>
            <p>Nay, let conſcience dive into the heart and ſearch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very corner of it; and pray GOD to ſearch you and to ſhew you more and more the blackneſs, the filthineſs and turpitude of your own heart. There ſee your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to GOD, your unreconciledneſs to his ways, your diſaffection to his holineſs. View your heart in the glaſs of GOD's perfect word;—view it as diſcribed in Matthew xv. 19.</p>
            <p>VIEW it as the ſeat of pride, malice, hypocriſy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, covetouſneſs and ſenſuality; view it as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as the ſea of Sodom, from whence all the ſtreams of wickedneſs flow.—View the ſins of your life, view them over again and again; let them be continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; but the heart like an ocean ſwallows them all;—view the evil of them eſpecially as they are againſt a GOD of infinite purity and excellence. Let us view them as the thorns, the nails and the ſpear that pierced the LORD of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:043342_0004_101D0421A1BC4AA0"/>
VIEW the juſt damand's of GOD's all-perfect law,—<hi>The ſoul that ſineth it ſhall die,</hi> Ezekiel xviii. 4. View the rottenneſs of your own righteouſneſs, the ſins of your beſt ſervices, and be humbled under your moral inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to help yourſelves.</p>
            <p>AND when you have wandered up and down in ſelf, and in the world, ſeeking help of creatures, and have found none, come to JESUS CHRIST, he can help when all others fail. He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt. Come to him; thouſands reject him and are damned; but come ye to this infinitely glorious SAVIOUR, and prove his excellence.</p>
            <p>THE Greeks came to him at the feaſt; Nichodemas came to him; the Cyrophenician woman came to him, thouſands have come to him miſerable as you are, and not one that cometh will be caſt out.</p>
            <p>Do you ſay if he were upon earth as he was once, you would come to him?—I tell you JESUS CHRIST is even now upon earth by his word and ſpirit; he is here in his humble form by his witneſſes and people, and bleſſed are they who are not offended in him: Verily you may now come to him in a manner that is as pleaſing to him, and as ſaving to you, as if you had beheld him and come to him in the days of his fleſh upon earth.</p>
            <p>O COME to him; come now; come as you are; come beggars; come with all your ſins, blindneſs, poverty and diſgrace, caſt yourſelves at his feet. He, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous LAMB of GOD, invites you, ſaying come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</p>
            <p>IF you think you are even as black as the blackeſt in hell, come and be married to the PRINCE of LIFE. Come, experience the efficacy of his all purifying blood, 
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043342_0005_101D04242B8D6230"/>
which never failed to cleanſe the blackeſt; no not Mary Magdalen, a perſecuting Saul, or a thief on the croſs. But it may be, one ſay's, I am worſe than any of theſe, I have ſinned beyond them! Well, dear heart, what then? What if you are legion, poſſeſſed of a legion of devils? Don't let us diſtruſt CHRIST's ſufficiency or his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he is ſtronger than the ſtrong man armed; he conquers hell and death, and ſhouts his victories. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair not; thank GOD that he has begun to open your eyes, while others are going blindfold to hell.</p>
            <p>BE not weary of your ſadneſs, while the laughter, the ſcoffing and mirth of fools is like the crackling of thorns under a pot—You now ſorrow and they rejoice; but it is poſſible, if you grieve not the holy ſpirit, that you may yet rejoice when they may ſorrow without hope. Think how intollerable hell would be, were it only to dwell forever with thine own unſanctified ſelf, under the reigning power of thine unreſtraining paſſions, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an accuſing conſcience, that worm which dieth not, forever praying like a vulture upon thine heartſtrings. Every man is born and brought up with the ſeeds of hell in him 'till grace ſubdues them.</p>
            <p>As you would not endure this; as you would not endure the wrath of Almighty GOD, with devils in the flaming regions of endleſs diſpair; and as you would obtain pardon, peace, joy, bliſs and glory above, come to JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST for all that you need.</p>
            <p>COME to him for teaching; he is a glorious teacher come from GOD; lie at his feet; confeſſ your ſins; make reſtitution to thoſe you have injured; forgive your enemy from the heart; and as you forgive, pray GOD, for CHRIST's ſake, to forgive you.</p>
            <p>THUS come to JESUS CHRIST to have ſins pardoned, guilt removed, luſts and corruptions ſubdued, grace and ſtrength communicated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:043342_0006_101D0426073B7C78"/>
RENOUNCE the world, the fleſh and the devil, give up yourſelf, your all, to GOD, in JESUS CHRIST, to be his entirely, to do or to ſuffer whatever he calls you to in life, truſting in his merits alone for the acceptance of your perſons and ſervices.</p>
            <p>THESE are the terms of divine favour to every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; O how glorious! How infinitely reaſonable our compliance! GOD does not require us to inveſtigate the number of fixed ſtars, or to track the blazing comet, but <hi>that we believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> Here is peace, if all the world are at odds, and ſafety, if the heavens and earth be diſſolved.</p>
            <p>BUT for us to continue ſtupid and ſecure in this day, is more awful than the judgments we feel, being a ſurer foreboder of ruin. In this ſenſe, <hi>quos deus vult perdere prius dementat.</hi> O madneſs without parallel, and ruin without remedy!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore, my countrymen and brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us no longer, like the Jews, mock the great Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah with our hypocritical ſhews, as we have often done, for he looks at the inward part: Therefore let us repent and turn unto him with all our heart, if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the LORD may yet turn from his fierce anger, that is kindled againſt us, and be a preſent help in time of need. Let us not be deceived; GOD is not mocked. But let us, O land, repent indeed of our ſins, of our profaneneſs, of our drunkenneſs, of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, of our ſabbath-breaking, of our injuſtice, of our covetouſneſs and oppreſſion, of our neglect of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and other devotions; let us repent and mourn for our horrid abuſe of the glorious goſpel and the greateſt privileges that ever a nation enjoyed. And, in the matter of oppreſſion, do not the thing that thou condemneſt in another, knowing that with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again, Matthew, vii, 2. For theſe ſins our fields have more than once ſmoaked with the blood of our young men; many wives are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come widows, and many children are become fatherleſs, 
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:043342_0007_101D0427C9D03118"/>
and thouſands of our brethren are ſlain, or wounded, or carried into captivity.</p>
            <p>WHEREAS we all, miniſters, rulers and people, have by our ſins procured this, let us all as one man unite in repenting and turning unto the LORD. Let every family and every perſon mourn apart, and no longer, by provoking GOD, go on to plunge the fatal ſteel into the boſoms of our dear ones. What I ſay to one, I ſay to all. Let every parent and every child, every town and every ſociety, cry to GOD for his help, ſending up every prayer in the name of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. Pray in public, pray in your families, in your cloſets, or in the fields; pray with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, pray and faint not. Let inceſſent fervent prayers be aſcending up to GOD from all parts of the land, that he, in his infinite love and mercy, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for us, and cauſe his bleſſed ſpirit to be poured out that we may be awakened to a thorough reformation; and that GOD would ſave us when we have no might to ſave ourſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to thoſe who in this day frolick and carouſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY FRIENDS, though you forget your ſins, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your ſins will not forget you: If you fly from them they will follow you, as the ſhadow doth its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and no diſtance or time, nor change of place, can alter or efface them. While you murder time at your revels, conſcience behind the door minutes even your thoughts, and her black bill is now repoſited in ſtore againſt you, which death will ſoon read;—he, the end of all your mirth, is now at the door, and hell follows with him. O what a change is at hand! Now you dance to the violin; then you muſt dance to death's pipe. Now the ſparks of luſt kindle, then the fire of hell burns. Now you ſin in jeſt; then GOD damns in earneſt. Now you bark at the word; then you howl at yourſelves.</p>
            <p>O be wiſe; for what is a ſand to the globe; a drop to the ocean; a ſunbeam to its fountain, and a ſhort life of mirth to eternal pain.</p>
