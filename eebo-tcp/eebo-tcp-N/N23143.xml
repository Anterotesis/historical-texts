            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I MUST inform the reader, that the following pages, offered to his peruſal, have not been undertaken with a view of being made public. They are no more than the reſult of ſome private leſſons, dictated from memory, to a worthy and reſpectable family of this city, whoſe education has been entruſted to me. As I have had the ſatisfaction of obſerving that it has produced the happieſt effects in the minds of the children, for whom only I deſigned it, I have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that it will be equally uſeful and inſtructive to all thoſe who ſhall care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully peruſe it. The moral it contains is really good and excellent; and Oh! what finer moral than that, which tends to form the mind, the judgment, and the heart of young people! What finer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral than that which makes them diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the advantages and neceſſity of a
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:030594_0003_0FE7F438140818F8"/>good education; which brings before their eyes thoſe ideas which, in all ages and in the beſt governments, have been entertained on this ſubject! What finer moral than that, which manifeſts and explains to them their duties; not only the duties which are impoſed on them in youth, but even thoſe which they ſhall have afterwards to diſcharge at the different periods of life; not only the perſonal duties which concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but even the relative with reſpect to God, ſociety, and the different claſſes of men with whom they have connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and are obliged to live! What finer moral than that, which teaches them to think, to reflect, to know themſelves and others; which gives them a juſt conception of the intrinſic value of things, and demonſtrates to them in what real merit conſiſts! What finer moral, in ſhort, than that, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents virtue as it really is, that is to ſay, amiable and deſirable in its very nature; which makes their attachment to their duties, even their intereſt and happineſs, by evincing, that to be happy, we muſt
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:030594_0004_0FE7F43EC2373708"/>be religious, prudent, wiſe, humane, gentle, moderate, patient, juſt, diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, temperate, magnanimous, &amp;c. and rendering this <hi>great truth</hi> obvious to them, <hi>that virtue is the only road to felicity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such, in few words, is the idea which the reader may form of this production; and ſuch is the ſubject of it. It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a plan, nor a ſyſtem of public or private education. Nothing ſyſtematic can be diſcovered in its compoſition. It is a ſimple, conciſe explanation of the fundamental truths, and evident princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which ſhould be at all times the great ſpring of the actions and conduct of every good man, and which, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, it is extremely important to inculcate and engrave on the hearts of youth. It is, as the Title deſcribes it, A compendious Tract of Morality, the ſcope of which is, to teach the nobleſt of all arts, that of becoming a good man, or a virtuous woman.</p>
            <p>Finally, It is not ſo entirely confined to the inſtruction of young perſons, as to become unprofitable to thoſe more
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:030594_0005_0FE7F4405E78B478"/>advanced in years; eſpecially to fathers and mothers, who can never be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently convinced of the great obligations they have contracted, as to the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their children.</p>
            <p>A deſire of being uſeful to the public, is the motive which ſtimulates me, in preſenting them theſe pages. My wiſhes will be accompliſhed, if I can obtain this end.</p>

            <head>A <hi>TREATISE</hi> ON MORALITY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHAT is the chief advantage which children may receive from their parents?</p>
            <p>A good education.</p>
            <p>Is not education the baſis on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the fate of their whole life?</p>
            <p>It is ſo ſaid, and with juſtice.</p>
            <p>Is not the happineſs or miſery of human life entirely owing to education? that is to ſay, to the principles we receive in youth?</p>
            <p>It abſolutely is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:030594_0007_0FE7F448B11E7680"/>
Does not the ſtrength and ſolidity of a building totally reſt on the firmneſs of the foundation which ſuſtains it?</p>
            <p>Moſt undoubtedly.</p>
            <p>Can an edifice, built on a weak founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, long exiſt? Is it not threatened with approaching ruin?</p>
            <p>Such an edifice cannot long exiſt; it muſt certainly fall in a little time.</p>
            <p>Is it not the ſame with reſpect to educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If it is vicious, if it does not tend to impreſs our minds with good, generous, and virtuous ſentiments, can we ever hope to become prudent, diſcreet, reſpectable, and capable of fulfilling with dignity the duties of that ſtation in life which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has allotted us?</p>
            <p>Without a good education a child can ſcarcely afterwards acquire the qualities which render man good and virtuous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:030594_0008_0FE7F44F480567E0"/>
An ancient has obſerved, that youth is the moſt reſpectable of the different ſtages of life: Is the obſervation juſt? and, In what ſenſe ſhould we comprehend it?</p>
            <p>The remark is juſt; becauſe that age commonly decides the happineſs or miſery of future life.</p>
            <p>Do we not frequently compare a child to a young plant?</p>
            <p>Yes—we are accuſtomed to make that compariſon.</p>
            <p>Is not a young plant, newly received into the boſom of the earth, ſuſceptible of every form we wiſh to give it?</p>
            <p>That it is, without the leaſt difficulty.</p>
            <p>If it is not ſtraight; if it is bent and crooked, or inclined downward; can we not eaſily make it erect, in the firſt ſtages of its growth, and remove all its imperfections?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:030594_0009_0FE7F450DDBF47B8"/>
This is done with facility, and continually practiſed.</p>
            <p>If we wait till it has grown up, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered ſtrength with its growth, will it then be as pliant, as manageable, and as fit to receive a new form?</p>
            <p>By no means—we ſhould then have more difficulty in making it receive new impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Will not the taſk become more difficult in proportion as it is delayed, and as the plant increaſes and grows larger?</p>
            <p>That muſt naturally be the caſe.</p>
            <p>Should we wait till it becomes a great tree, would it then be poſſible to change its ſtubborn inclination? Would it not, on the contrary, always preſerve it, whatever pains we may take, or deſires we may have, to ſubdue it into new habits?</p>
            <p>It is certain the plant we treat of will ever remain in this defective ſtate, from
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030594_0010_0FE7F4575EACC0B0"/>which no human exertions will be capable of altering it.</p>
            <p>Do not theſe different conditions of the plant give us a lively idea of the different ſtages of human life, namely, infancy, youth, and mature years?</p>
            <p>Perfectly well—and it is eaſy to make the application.</p>
            <p>Do not the defective forms obſerved in ſome plants repreſent to us the defects per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſome children?</p>
            <p>The compariſon is ſimple and natural.</p>
            <p>By the ſame mode of reaſoning, as we may eaſily remedy the defects in tender plants in the firſt ſeaſon of their growth, is it not likely that we may, with the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, remedy the imperfections of youth, when reaſon begins to dawn on the infant ſoul?</p>
            <p>To me it ſeems ſo—and I believe that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly youth is the moſt proper ſeaſon to amend the defects which then begin to appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:030594_0011_0FE7F458F5ACC0D0"/>
Do you not imagine, that if, at ſuch a period, young people are neglected, their imperfections will increaſe, ſtrengthen, and take a new and wayward turn, like the plant in its ſecond ſtate; and that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it will be infinitely more difficult to reform them, ſhould ſuch an arduous taſk be undertaken?</p>
            <p>It is true, no doubt, and daily experience confirms it.</p>
            <p>What would you think if thoſe very young people conſtantly practiſed the errors of youth, and perſevered in them to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced age?</p>
            <p>I muſt think they would certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come habitual; and habit to man is a kind of ſecond nature.</p>
            <p>Do you ſuppoſe that a tree can produce good fruit, if neglected and left to itſelf?</p>
            <p>In order that a tree ſhould yield good fruit, it is very neceſſary to attend to it, eſpecially when it is young.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030594_0012_0FE7F45FC580DFE0"/>
Do we ever ſee good ſeed ſown in the ground till it is firſt ploughed and tilled?</p>
            <p>No—the earth muſt be tilled if the wiſh to reap the harveſt in the ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>What does the beſt ſoil produce, when it is not prepared by the labour of man?</p>
            <p>Soil thus neglected, yields nothing but brambles, thorns, and noxious herbs.</p>
            <p>What does the brighteſt genius produce when it is not cultivated with diligence, and enriched by the advantages of a good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</p>
            <p>The brighteſt genius without the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a good education, can hardly ever yield any good, noble, great, or generous ſentiment.</p>
            <p>To what ſhould a young perſon apply, who has received the benefit of a good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:030594_0013_0FE7F4615FC12298"/>
To the ſtudy of virtue, ſcience, and good manners.</p>
            <p>Which of theſe two advantages, virtue or ſcience, merits the preference?</p>
            <p>Virtue is preferable to all things.</p>
            <p>Is not the man to whom virtue is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted, to be eſteemed at all times, and in the eyes of the whole world?</p>
            <p>Yes—virtue alone is ſufficient to render a man each moment valuable, and in every age.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030594_0016_0FE7F4706317EEB8"/>how they formerly inſtructed the youth of Perſia, Lacedemonia, Athens, and Rome?—begin with Perſia.</p>
            <p>Formerly in Perſia, the education of youth was conſidered the moſt important duty, and eſſential province of government: it did not depend on the attention of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, whom a blind and partial tenderneſs often rendered incapable of this care: the ſtate was entruſted with it: the youth were educated in common, after an uniform man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by which all were regulated: the ſcene and continuance of their recreations; the time of their meals; the quality of their meat and drink; the number of their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; the different modes of chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>In Perſia the youth went to ſchool to learn juſtice, as elſewhere they go there to acquire literature and the ſciences. The crime they puniſhed moſt, was that of ingratitude.</p>
            <p>There were ſome in a claſs from child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood till they were ſixteen or ſeventeen years old, at which period they entered the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030594_0017_0FE7F471F7291FD0"/>claſs of young men; and then the ſtricteſt authority was exerciſed over them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that age, above any other, has need of the guardian eye of vigilance to watch over it. They remained ten years in this claſs, under the direction of four different maſters, diſtinguiſhed for their ſcience, but much more for their merit. It was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of each of theſe to inſtruct them in a particular virtue: one taught religion; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other juſtice; the third pointed out the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruffled ſerenity proceeding from temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and the fourth inſtilled the principles of courage.</p>
            <p>The third claſs was compoſed of thoſe arrived at the ſtate of manhood. Places and preferments were granted in the ſtate to thoſe only who had paſſed through the different claſſes, and given proofs of their application, merit, and abilities.</p>
            <p>Falſehood was ſeverely puniſhed, and any one inclined to this vice was conſidered as infamous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:030594_0018_0FE7F4786C45EC60"/>
The object of the Perſians in their whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome laws reſpecting education was, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent evil, perſuaded that it was better to do ſo than to puniſh it: And whilſt in other ſtates, puniſhments were decreed to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on criminals, they endeavoured to act in ſuch a manner, as that among them, there ſhould be no guilty perſons.</p>
            <p>What was the authority of parents over their children?</p>
            <p>It was very great—they had the power of life and death over them.</p>
            <p>How did they educate their children at Lacedemon?</p>
            <p>Much the ſame way as at Perſia: they did not commit to parents the education of their children; the ſtate took charge of them, and cauſed them all to be brought up in the ſame manner. The great princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the legiſlature of Lacedemon was, that as children belonged to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030594_0019_0FE7F47A0AD7F870"/>they ſhould be educated by the commonwealth, and for the public weal.</p>
            <p>The grand ſcience which they taught them, above all other things, was, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and implicit obedience to the laws, to magiſtrates, to their parents, and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to all thoſe who were older than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. In fact, their obedience was not confined to their own parents alone, but all others had equally a right of commanding them; ſo that if any parent had detected a child in error, he was obliged to reprove, correct, and chaſtiſe him: if the child hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to complain to his own parent, it would have been conſidered ſhameful in him, did he not inflict the ſame puniſhment which was already felt from the hands of the ſtranger, who was the ſubject of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
            <p>They inured them early to hardſhip, to enable them to ſupport all ſorts of fatigue and labour: from the age of ſeven years, they were ſet to work in order to invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030594_0020_0FE7F480C03F5EA8"/>their bodies: they were accuſtomed to different exerciſes ſuitable to their years and growth: they always had ſome elderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon among them, who preſided at their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; and in his abſence the moſt prudent youth was made guardian over the reſt, who were ſubject to him.</p>
            <p>They were obliged to ſleep on hard beds, compoſed of a kind of reeds, which they collected with their own hands, without the help of any implement: their apparel was always of the ſame ſtuff, and they had not the liberty of changing it according to the ſeaſons: they were not ſuffered to uſe nightly lamps to light them through the ſtreets.</p>
            <p>They were admitted to public feaſts, which, it is known, took place in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public. Thither they daily went to dine with their fathers. When they entered the hall, the eldeſt pointing to the door de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to them theſe words, "Let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is mentioned here be conveyed hence through that gateway." This was
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030594_0021_0FE7F48259301EC0"/>done in order to accuſtom them to keep ſecrets. Thoſe feaſts were to them an excellent ſchool of inſtruction, for ſobriety, temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, wiſdom, and modeſty. Here they heard ſerious diſcourſes on politics, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and morals; eulogiums on good and virtuous actions; and ſevere ſtrictures on thoſe which were unworthy. Hence they became acquainted with the characters of great men, and thoſe virtues which had endeared them to the ſtate.</p>
            <p>In order to form the heart and judgment, ſeveral queſtions were propoſed to them, ſuch as follow: Who was the moſt honeſt man in the republic? Which were the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary virtues to form a good magiſtrate, a good general, &amp;c.? they had to reply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to theſe interrogatories; and he who failed to do ſo was inſtantly puniſhed. Their anſwers were conciſe and pertinent; for they were accuſtomed to ſay little, but to convey much in few words, becauſe their language was lively, ſhort, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; and on this account the Lacedemonian language is termed <hi>laconic;</hi> ſo that we ſtill
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030594_0022_0FE7F48913EBABA0"/>ſay, when we ſpeak of a perſon who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf with brevity, that his ſtyle is <hi>laconic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Could you quote ſome examples of this brevity of ſtyle?</p>
            <p>Among others the two following are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: Philip, king of Macedon, being at war with the Lacedemonians, informed them by letter, that if he entered their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories with his army, he would lay all waſte before him. They anſwered him by this ſingle monoſyllable, <hi>if.</hi>—The ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch having addreſſed them in a long let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which he required to know of them, whether he ſhould enter Laconia as a friend or enemy? They replied, <hi>neither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Could you introduce here any inſtances of the courage and patience of the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian children, in ſupporting their ills?</p>
            <p>Hiſtory offers us the two following: A Lacedemonian child being employed in a religious ceremony, it happened that a
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030594_0023_0FE7F48AAC907280"/>burning coal fell on his ſleeve which took fire and burned his hand: he endured the pain without ſhedding a tear, or making any attempt to extinguiſh the fire; and all this not to interrupt the order of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
            <p>They report that another child, having ſtolen a fox, concealed it inſide his ſhirt: the ferocious animal tore out his bowels, without the child's complaining, who dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his theft might be diſcovered.</p>
            <p>In what manner did the philoſophers, particularly Socrates, inſtruct and form the youth at Athens?</p>
            <p>The cuſtom of the ancient philoſophers at Athens was to aſſemble, at ſtated times, and collect their diſciples; to diſcourſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly in their preſence on the different branches of philoſophy; to examine them often on the moſt important points in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, politics, and government, and minute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expound theſe different ſubjects. Thus Socrates, Plato, Ariſtotle, and many others,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030594_0024_0FE7F4916ED92230"/>educated their followers. Plato held his ſchool in a garden at Athens, called aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy; from thence we derive the ſame name which we uſe in the preſent day to denote the different ſocieties of learned men.</p>
            <p>When any of their ſcholars had a lively deſire to purſue the ſciences and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ambition to become a philoſopher, he choſe one who was moſt eminent in that part of literature which he was ſo emulous to acquire; he became attached to him in a particular manner; he conſtantly followed him for whole years, and applied himſelf the entire time to learn his leſſons, to ſtudy his principles, and to form his conduct after his example.</p>
            <p>In ſuch manner was Archelaus the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Anaxagoras; Socrates of Archelaus; Xenophon and Plato of Socrates; Xende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates and Ariſtotle of Plato; beſides many others. There were ſome even who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook long voyages, in order to find out ſome diſtinguiſhed literary character, under whom they ſtudied many years. Among thoſe
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030594_0025_0FE7F4930B86A348"/>different philoſophers, there is one who me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits our particular attention, and whoſe name is highly worthy to be made known to you here; I mean Socrates, who may be juſtly conſidered one of the greateſt ſages among the heathens. This great man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted his chief labours, and almoſt his whole life, to the inſtruction of youth. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs what important ſervices he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſtate by his inſtruction, and the great number of pupils he had formed. Never had maſter ſo many, nor any more illuſtrious. It ſeems, ſays Libanius, that he was the common father of the republic, he was ſo watchful over the welfare and intereſts of all.</p>
            <p>Before his time, the philoſophers ſtudied natural objects; they had warm diſputes about matters which they could not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom; on the manner in which the world has been formed; on the cauſe of pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena which happen in the heavens and on the earth. Socrates deemed ſuch reſearches of no utility, and conſidered thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced them deficient in true wiſdom and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030594_0026_0FE7F49995820EC8"/>ſolid underſtanding. What gave him a great diſguſt to the different ſects who lived in his time was, particularly the infinite diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and inconſiſtency of the opinions which they taught. For, ſaid he, even amongſt madmen, we find ſome who are not intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated at the appearance of things which are really terrifying, and others who are ſcared at the ſight of the moſt common and well-known objects: even among the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers of our days, there are ſome who bluſh not publicly to indulge their diſciples in principles the moſt repugnant to the common ideas of reaſon and decorum; while others, who fall into oppoſite errors, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffer them to leave their dwellings, or to do the moſt ſimple and innocent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: we obſerve ſome who ridicule tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, altars, and the Divinity himſelf; others who give into the moſt extravagant ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and go ſo far as to adore ſtatues of, wood, and even thoſe of brutes.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe ſects who ſtudy the nature of the univerſe; one party aſſerts that there is but one world; another pretends that
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030594_0027_0FE7F49B2AE093E8"/>there are an infinity. Thoſe would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all the parts of the world are in perpetual motion; theſe that it remains in a ſtate of perfect and unchangeable repoſe, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From his obſervations on ſuch contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inconſiſtencies in the ſchools, he was eſtranged from them, and ſought a more certain and uſeful method. He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a track of philoſophy comprehending more generally received and eſtabliſhed principles, of ſome advantage to his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and infinitely more valuable, ſolid, and permanent; a moral and practical philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which tends to make man better.</p>
            <p>He was the firſt, ſays Cicero, who made wiſdom deſcend from above, to dwell in the habitations and in the midſt of families. He kept no open ſchool, like the other philoſophers, not ſet hours for his leſſons. He was a philoſopher of all ſeaſons and all hours: he taught in every place, and on every occaſion: on his walks, in converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at meals, in the army, the midſt of the camp, in public aſſemblies of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030594_0028_0FE7F4A25C7E9610"/>or the ſenate, even in the priſon, and when taking a draught of hemlock, he phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophized, ſays Plutarch, and inſtructed mankind.</p>
            <p>At Athens, his cuſtom was, to go every day into the ſtreets, ſquares, and aſſemblies; he there familiarly and ſimply treated on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects relating to government and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of life: he ſpoke of piety, impiety; honeſty, diſhoneſty; juſtice, injuſtice; wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and folly; courage and cowardice; on government, the republic, politics, magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracy, and all things of which the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is neceſſary to man.</p>
            <p>His method of teaching was to make many interrogatories; hence it was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he was himſelf ignorant of things he profeſſed to teach others, and that he thereby ſought to improve himſelf. There was, however, ſuch exquiſite art in his queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and he propoſed them in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to render the truths ſo clear and preciſe, that it was impoſſible for his hearers not to conſent to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:030594_0029_0FE7F4A3F7D18918"/>
He accompanied his inſtructions with a great number of compariſons, which were very plain, and drawn from the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ſimple ſubjects. He knew ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well how to adapt himſelf to the capacity and wants of his hearers, pointing out to each the duties of his ſtation and years: he began, by impreſſing on their minds the principles of religion; above all things recommending to them, never to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any thing without conſulting the will of the gods, and endeavouring to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them propitious, by offering up the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices uſed in his time. From thence he entered into a detail of the obligations of civil life, admoniſhing the men to be good huſbands; the women to be diſcreet, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, wiſe, and virtuous; both to be good fathers and mothers; to give their children a turn for labour; to teach them the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of virtue, and inſpire them with a love of their country: directing the children alſo to be reſpectful to their parents, docile and ſubmiſſive to their ſuperiors. He ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly recommended to all his fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens a zealous attachment to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030594_0030_0FE7F4AA822A3EB8"/>an entire ſubmiſſion to the orders of magiſtracy, and the laws of the ſtate. He expatiated much on theſe different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, pointing every ſentiment to the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the heart, more forcibly than to the underſtanding; diſplaying truth with that ſimple, natural eloquence, at the ſame time animated and pathetic, which renders vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue truly amiable, and could not fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the moſt happy impreſſions on his hearers. It is not then aſtoniſhing, that he ſo happily ſucceeded in luring from the paths of vice ſuch a vaſt number of youth.</p>
            <p>Socrates never inſtructed his pupils in the precepts of eloquence, till he had firſt given them a taſte of the moral and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal virtues: he ſaw plainly that virtue ſhould be the foundation of eloquence; and that we ſhould be good and virtuous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are eloquent. As to eloquence, his opinion was, that whoever conceives a thing juſtly, can eaſily explain it, and give an account of it to others. On theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he was aſſiduous in giving his ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars clear, juſt, and diſtinct notions of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030594_0031_0FE7F4AC197D1DB0"/>things; which he did by explaining them in the moſt circumſtantial manner. The better to accompliſh his views, he made uſe of dialogue, and propoſed queſtions, which threw light on the ſubject, and rendered it obvious to every capacity. If he entered on any diſcourſe, he began by laying down ſure and evident principles, deeming it the beſt mode of convincing. Likewiſe, ſays Xenophon, he was of all I ever knew, the man, who, without contradiction, had the happieſt knack at perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>The following examples, which Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon has offered us, may give us an idea of the manner in which Socrates taught the virtues he ſo diligently recommended to his diſciples; and abhorred the vices, for which he implanted in their minds the utmoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and averſion.</p>
            <p>He aſked them, Whether liberty was not one of the moſt invaluable bleſſings which man could enjoy? Yes, undoubtedly, replied they. Do you think him free who ſuffers himſelf to be hurried away by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030594_0032_0FE7F4B2D737C190"/>gratifications, inordinate paſſions, and their deſpotic ſway, that iron bar to the practice of virtue? No—he cannot be free. What opinion have you of thoſe maſters who divert us from good, and lead us into evil? They are, in our judgment, the moſt wicked of all mankind. Do not all the world agree, that the paſſions, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that of intemperance, hinder man from the exerciſe of virtue, and urge him to evil? It is an unqueſtionable truth. What would you think of a prince, who would deprive his ſubjects of their property, the ſtate of its citizens, ſociety of its members, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of their ſupport? of a prince, who, having no law but his tyrannical will, would condemn to miſery, to torture, to diſeaſe, to violent and ſudden death, thoſe who would acknowledge his authority? of a prince, in ſhort, whoſe laws would be much more injurious to his ſubjects, than ſalutary or advantageous? What idea muſt you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain of ſuch a prince? He would truly appear, in our eyes, the moſt cruel of all tyrants. This barbarous tyrant, returns Socrates, is intemperance, who ſuddenly
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030594_0033_0FE7F4B46F7A01C8"/>whelms, in every calamity, thoſe who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his laws. He ſtrips them of their rights, in order to enſlave them to cuſtoms which religion, honour, and reaſon unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly reject. He deprives the ſtate of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, by rendering them incapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming uſeful to it; ſociety of its members, to which they are a plague, by the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of their bad examples; and families of their hopes, to which they prove, by the baſeneſs of their conduct, a ſcandal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy. This frantic tyrant plunges his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims into a ſea of troubles. He never ceaſes to level his empoiſoned arrows in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to wound them in every part; in their perſon, property, mind, conſcience, honour, and reputation. This vice is the ſource of ſufferings and diſeaſes; the cauſe of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and untimely deaths; the ruin of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, children, and friends.</p>
            <p>What we ſay here of intemperance, we can equally ſay of the other vices and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate paſſions, of anger, pride, gluttony, avarice, and ambition. Theſe cruel maſters command, with ſuch authority, the ſlaves,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030594_0034_0FE7F4BB065E9998"/>which are once ſubject to them, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the labours of their youth and age, they compel them to devote their whole time to their ſervice; to yield them the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire produce of thoſe labours; to undergo many hardſhips and difficulties; and at laſt, even to ſink into poverty and wretchedneſs, for the gratification of their deſires. But at length, when they are worn out in the ſervice, and incapable of being any longer uſeful to them, their maſters forſake them, ſuffering them to languiſh in old age, and drag on a miſerable exiſtence, in deſpair and unavailing penſive reflections on the paſt.</p>
            <p>He thus makes them perceive that they are blindfolded by this vice, and prevented from diſtinguiſhing what is good and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; that the heart is vitiated by it, and drawn from the love of virtue; that it pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes all the powers of the ſoul, and gives it an evil tendency in all things. To this paſſion he contraſts the virtue of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which he paints in beautiful colours: he proves to them that it procures infinite advantages; that it is the ſource of true
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030594_0035_0FE7E92091770220"/>pleaſure, and the parent of real happineſs; that it alone gives liberty to the ſoul, and leiſure to indulge in the practice of good morals; that it always preſerves the body in health and the mind in tranquillity; that it makes union and proſperity reign in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; that it procures the eſteem and friendſhip of all worthy people; that it places man in a condition of becoming uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his friends and his country; and that, in ſhort, it renders youth healthful and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, and old age pleaſant and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He concludes, that we ſhould then be attached to this virtue, love and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it, and, on the contrary, that we ought to combat the oppoſite vice with the ſame zeal and courage with which we attack an unjuſt enemy, who attempts to rob us of liberty.</p>
            <p>Is it not true, obſerved he at times, that in order to ſucceed and improve in any ſcience whatever, we muſt ſtudy a long time its principles and rules; learn from the beſt maſters, and be formed in their ſchools? Could we be ſo weak as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030594_0036_0FE7F4BC9F28DE20"/>that we muſt not follow the ſame plan in acquiring the moſt uſeful, great, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all profeſſions, that of knowing how to live well? Is it not aſtoniſhing to remark, that thoſe who wiſh to become phyſicians, or to learn any other ſcience, apply to the beſt maſters reſpectively, and that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of mankind neglect to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to thoſe maſters which they have moſt occaſion for; ſuch as could teach them the rules of life, the principles of good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, the knowledge of their duties, the ſcience of virtues, and the good qualities of the ſoul, which alone conſtitute the dignity and happineſs of man?</p>
            <p>It is not, ſtill continued he, gold nor ſilver, which makes ſome men better or greater than others; it is the precepts of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the leſſons of wiſdom, that enrich the mind, and put it in poſſeſſion of the treaſures of virtue, which are far prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the wealth of worlds.</p>
            <p>Socrates took particular care to give his ſcholars a high idea of the power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030594_0037_0FE7F4C337611020"/>of the gods: you may judge of it by the admirable converſation which he held with Euthydeme, on Providence. Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon has preſerved it for us, and Mr. Rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin relates it in his Ancient Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Have you never reflected, ſays Socrates to Euthydeme, how the gods have taken care to give mankind all that is neceſſary? Never, I aſſure you, replies he. Do you ſee, returns Socrates, how uſeful light is to us, and how precious that gift beſtowed us by the gods? Indeed, replies Euthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme, we ſhould be like blind men without it, and all nature would be lifeleſs. But becauſe we have need of reſt, they have given us night for repoſe. They have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that the ſun, that brilliant and lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous planet, ſhould preſide by day, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the different parts thereof; and that it ſerve, not only to unfold the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of nature, but to bear life and heat throughout the univerſe. They have alſo ordained, that the ſtars and the moon illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the night, which is in itſelf obſcure and gloomy. Can there be any thing ſo
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030594_0038_0FE7F4C4D4F53C00"/>admirable as this variety, this alternate change of night and day, of light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of labour and reſt; and all deſigned for the good of man?</p>
            <p>Socrates, in like manner, related the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite advantages we receive from fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in ſupplying the wants of life. Continuing his obſervations on the wonderful attention of Providence to all that regards us, What ſay you, enquired he, on perceiving that after winter the ſun returns to us; and that as the fruits of one ſeaſon decay, he ripens thoſe that ſucceed? that having rendered this ſervice to man, he retires, as it would ſeem, from an apprehenſion of incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us with his heat? Afterwards, when he withdraws to a certain boundary, which he cannot exceed without putting us in danger of periſhing with cold, he returns back again, to take up his quarters in that region of the heavens where his preſence proves moſt beneficial to us; and as we cannot ſuffer exceſſive cold on heat, ſhould the tranſition be ſudden from one to the other, is it not worthy of admiration, that
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030594_0039_0FE7F4CB72450C90"/>this luminary approaches and retires from us ſo ſlowly that we arrive at either extreme, in a manner almoſt imperceptible? Would it be poſſible not to acknowledge, in this regularity of the annual ſeaſons, an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence, not only attentive to our wants, but even to our comforts?</p>
            <p>All theſe circumſtances, ſays Euthydeme, make me doubt whether the gods have heaped ſuch benefits on man only? One point alone ſtaggers my credulity, which is, that inferior animals participate in all the good things of this life as well as we. Yes, replies Socrates, but do you not ſee that theſe animals ſolely exiſt for the uſe of man? He ſubdues the moſt powerful and unwieldy of them, tames them, and employs them, with the utmoſt advantage, for war, labour, and other purpoſes.</p>
            <p>What muſt we think, if we ſurvey man on the ſcale of being? Here Socrates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the different ſenſes, by the exerciſe of which man enjoys all that is noble and excellent in nature; the vivacity of his wit,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030594_0040_0FE7F4CD0E46E458"/>and the ſtrength of his reaſon, which raiſe him infinitely above all other animals; the wonderful gift of ſpeech, by means of which, we mutually communicate our thoughts, publiſh our laws, and regulate the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>From what has been advanced, ſays So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, it is eaſy to infer the exiſtence of the gods, and that they ſhelter man under the wings of their protection, though he cannot diſcover them through the medium of his ſenſes. Do we perceive the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt cruſh all before it? Do we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the winds which, before our eyes, make ſuch dreadful ravages? Do we ever ſee our ſoul, which is ſo intimately blended with our exiſtence, which actuates and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates us? Is it not the ſame with reſpect to the gods, none of whom become viſible in order to diſtribute their favours. Even the Great God [theſe words are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able], this Great God, I ſay, who has cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the univerſe, and who ſuſtains the great work, whoſe parts are perfected in excellence and beauty; who decreed that
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030594_0041_0FE7F4D3CCA2FC40"/>they ſhould not grow old with time, but ever flouriſh in immortal youth; who alſo ordained, that they obey him with a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of motion which imagination cannot trace; this God is viſible enough in the wondrous works of the creation, of which he is the author; but always inviſible as to his perſon. Let us not then with-hold our belief from what we do not ſee; but inſtead of our corporeal eyes, let us uſe thoſe of the ſoul; and above all, let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to render proper homage to the Divinity, who wiſhes to be known but by his beneficence. This homage, this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, conſiſts in pleaſing him; and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pleaſe him but by performing his will.</p>
            <p>After this manner Socrates inſtructed youth; and ſuch were the principles and ſentiments with which he inſpired them.</p>
            <p>He frequently repeated in his diſcourſes, that the gods watched all our words and actions; pierced the deepeſt receſſes of the ſoul; were preſent at our deliberations, and inſpired us in all our affairs. Dead or living,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030594_0042_0FE7F4D56E77A910"/>ſaid he, the good man is never forgotten by the gods.</p>
            <p>Socrates alſo taught his diſciples the mode of preſerving health. He held it as a maxim, that man ſhould become acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own conſtitution, and with thoſe things which either agree or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with it; that he ſhould make uſe of the one and avoid the other, and become his own phyſician. He particularly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ſobriety to them, adviſing them carefully to ſhun thoſe luxurious diſhes and agreeable draughts, which only tend to provoke a falſe appetite, unſolicited by the calls of nature, in the preſſing demands of hunger and thirſt; and added, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo much as exceſs in eating and drinking, contributes to diſorder, all at once, the ſtomach, the head, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
            <p>The ardour of the young Athenians, in following his philoſophical principles, was incredible. They quitted father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and renounced all parties of pleaſure,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030594_0043_0FE7F4DD2D37A730"/>to adhere to him, and liſten to his doctrine. We may judge of it by Alcibiades, one of the moſt lively and impetuous young men of his time. The means, Socrates uſed, to check his pride, merits a place here. This young man was boaſting one day of the vaſt riches and property he poſſeſſed, when So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates laid a map before him, and aſked him where Greece was ſituated? The ſpace which this country occupied was too ſmall to be readily diſcerned: he at length, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, diſcovered a glimpſe of it, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it out; but on being requeſted to ſhew his own territories therein, It is a matter of too little importance, ſaid he, to be ſet down in ſo narrow a ſpace. This, then, replied Socrates, an imperceptible point of the globe, is what turns your brain.</p>
            <p>The leſſons which Socrates gave, made the greater impreſſion, becauſe he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf practiſed the virtues which he incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
            <p>The limit of this production do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to give his hiſtory; I beg leave to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:030594_0044_0FE7F4DECC4A1288"/>refer thoſe who wiſh to become acquainted with it, to Rollin's Works, or Xenophon's Memoirs.</p>
            <p>How were children educated at Rome?</p>
            <p>In turning over the pages of Roman hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, we have had frequent opportunities of remarking the care taken at Rome in the education of youth; we have obſerved it particularly in the perſon of Paulus Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius. This illuſtrious Roman, who had a perfect knowledge of the art of forming the mind, procured for his children the moſt eminent maſters of the age he lived in. Notwithſtanding the important duties of his ſtation, he often aſſiſted at their different exerciſes, in order to encourage them by his preſence. You may recollect that his children ſtrove, by a noble emulation, to fulfil the deſires and expectation of ſo good a father, by their application to ſtudy and their progreſs in the ſciences. Their taſte for literature was ſo great, that when he conquered the kingdom of Macedon, they would not deign to beſtow a glance on the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:030594_0045_0FE7F4E57796A2F8"/>immenſe treaſures of the king; they were only tempted by a view of the library in his palace, to requeſt it of Pauius Emilius, who granted their deſires.</p>
            <p>You have alſo ſeen how refined was the education of Scipio Africanus; how it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to form his mind and heart; what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he derived from it in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe great enterprizes which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards undertook; how much it contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to render him famous in war and in peace; to inſpire him, not only with poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and military virtues, but even with moral and private. The happy ſentiments which he diſcovered in the hiſtorian Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, attached this great man to him in a particular manner, and powerfully ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to acquire that high reputation which has rendered his name immortal.</p>
            <p>In Rome, the province of education was not confined to the men only; the women took a part in it, as we may judge from the following paſſage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="unknown:030594_0046_0FE7F4E7141EE4E8"/>
A Roman lady having gone to pay a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to one of her friends and neighbours, the toilet was the topic of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſtrange lady ſaid a great deal on the ſubject, and entered into a minute detail of the various jewels ſhe had in her poſſeſſion, and alſo of thoſe ornaments which ſerved to embelliſh the ſex. Her friend let her go on, without interruption, until her children, who were at ſchool, came home: when ſhe ſaw them enter the door, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the converſation, and introducing them, ſaid, I have not ſhewn you my jewels, becauſe I had them not; here they are now, and I may ſpeak to you about them: Theſe children you ſee are my dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, and the ornaments moſt dear to my heart: my delight and my glory conſiſt in poliſhing and adorning their minds, by a ſolid and virtuous education: the joy I feel in obſerving their progreſs in ſcience and virtue, is to me preferable to the poſſeſſion of the moſt rare and precious jewels.</p>
            <p>What muſt we infer from the premiſes, reſpecting the attention paid to the educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030594_0047_0FE7F4EDB7734060"/>of youth in the various ountrie have mentioned?</p>
            <p>We muſt conclude, that at all times, and in every poliſhed nation, the education of youth was eſteemed an eſſential and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable duty; and that the ancients were always perſuaded that the proſperity of ſtates, the happineſs of families, and the public as well as private welfare entirely depended on it. They were ever of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that what made a diſtinction between men, and rendered them truly worthy, did not reſult from riches, honours, rank, and dignity, but from piety, merit, and virtue.</p>
            <p>But theſe ſentiments cannot be firmly eſtabliſhed and impreſſed on the hearts of youth, without the advantages of a culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and virtuous education, purſued with unremitting application; of an education which makes us fill with honour the ſtation to which we are called, the ſphere of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are deſtined by Providence to move in; of an education, in ſhort, which brings us early acquainted with the duties we have
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030594_0048_0FE7E91CC6ED8770"/>to practiſe, and which form the whole eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of human life; which induces us to love and cheriſh thoſe duties, by inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this truth, that we cannot be happy or deſerving in the ſight of God or man, unleſs we faithfully diſcharge them.</p>
            <p>You aſk me what thoſe duties are, and you deſire that I ſhould expound, at leaſt, the fundamental ones, which ſerve as a baſis to all the reſt. Nothing more lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable than ſuch a deſire, and I conſider it my duty to gratify it. Reflection and the following particulars will aſſiſt you in your purſuit. The duties impoſed on man, and which we have to fulfil at all times, in all ages, and in every condition of life, are of three kinds: the firſt relate to God; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to ſociety and private life; the third to ourſelves, and are perſonal.</p>
            <p>That we have to perform certain duties to God, is an indiſputable and generally receive truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:030594_0049_0FE7F60D1420AA08"/>
In fact, if God has created heaven and earth; if he has formed the world out of nothing; if he has made man, and endued him with reaſon to diſtinguiſh between good and evil; if he has moulded him after his own image, by animating him with a ſoul capable of knowing, loving, ſerving, and adoring him; if he deſtines him for immortality; he cannot then leave him to chance in this world: He muſt therefore have manifeſted his will; preſcribed duties; appointed a mode of worſhip; and ordained a religion for man to regulate his actions; to put him in conſtant mind of the author of his exiſtence; and the end of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to give him a ſenſe of his obligations to the Deity; and keep him in a ſtate of perſevering ſubmiſſion and dependence on that Great Being.</p>
            <p>This religion then is divine, ſince it has God for its author; it exiſted at all times, ſince, by its nature, it can be traced back to the beginning of things: it is alſo as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the world: it is practiſed in all
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030594_0050_0FE7F4F66BAB1B90"/>countries, and for all men, ſince it is the work of the Sovereign Maſter of the whole world: it is the only true one, as God who founded it is the only true God: it is holy, as it flows from him who is holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs itſelf: it is neceſſary and indiſpenſable, ſince its end is to direct us on earth, and make us happy hereafter.</p>
            <p>This truth, that religion is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and indiſpenſable, has been acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in all ages, and even by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelves. You will find in the courſe of human affairs, ſays Plutarch, ſome cities without walls, without ſchools, without a king, without a theatre, and without any of the amuſements uſual in our republics; but you will not find any which do not acknowledge a God, call upon him as a witneſs, addreſs him in prayer and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to obtain ſome bleſſings, or avert ſome calamities: ſuch cities man has never ſeen, nor ever will. It appears to me more poſſible to build a town without a foundation and ground to ſupport it, than to eſtabliſh
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030594_0051_0FE7F4F8082E5470"/>a government without religion; it is that which ſuſtains, and makes human ſociety flouriſh; it is the baſis and the very ſinews of the laws.</p>
            <p>This would be a proper place to treat the preſent ſubject more fully; to deſcribe to you the different religions; to make you diſtinguiſh between thoſe invented by man, and that which has God for its authors; to point out the novelty or recent date of the former, and the antiquity of the latter; and to explain to you, in an ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the motives which ſhould determine our choice, and induce us to embrace that only true religion in preference to all others: but as we have already a number of excellent authors on this ſubject, which you can procure, I muſt refer you to their works, and requeſt of you to read them with an impartial judgment, and a ſincere deſire of coming at the truth. If it be the part of candour and rectitude of ſoul to ſeek it, and make it the rule of conduct, it ſhould certainly be our province, in a more
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030594_0052_0FE7F4FEAC066E78"/>exalted point of view, where our deareſt intereſt, thoſe of time and eternity, are concerned.</p>
            <p>After theſe reflections on our duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, we ſhall next diſcuſs thoſe we have to perform in ſociety towards mankind and ourſelves.</p>
            <p>After our duties towards God an reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, what others have we to fulfil?</p>
            <p>Thoſe naturally follow which we owe our parents: to know the nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of ſuch duties, it is ſufficient to call to mind the obligations we are under to them. The following reflections will ſerve to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to the mind.</p>
            <p>We are firſt indebted to them for our birth; ſhould they have no other claim to our gratitude, the voice of nature cries aloud that we ſhould teſtify it in the moſt ſenſible manner during our lives.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:030594_0053_0FE7F50048E45248"/>
But this favour, however great it may be conſidered in itſelf, is nothing, when compared to thoſe for which we are indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them ſince that period.</p>
            <p>Were we to trace back the firſt ſeaſon of life, and the time which has elapſed ſince our birth, What were we then capable of, and what cares and anxieties have we not occaſioned? Weakneſs and ignorance were our portion. Deſtitute of every thing except numerous wants, and unable of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſupply them; deprived of the means of making ourſelves underſtood; poſſeſſed of no language but that of tears and cries; incapable of uſing our limbs; apparently ſuffering in our helpleſs ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and finding no repoſe but in the arms and on the boſom of our mothers; what anxiety they then endured, what uneaſineſs, toil, and trouble they underwent?</p>
            <p>Among the numerous neceſſities inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from our condition, how muſt it be with thoſe children who ſeem repugnant to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030594_0054_0FE7F506CC366378"/>nature, and the general averſion for whom can only be ſubdued by the love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of fond mothers, whoſe ſufferings on this occaſion are the more poignant, as they are not limited to a ſhort time, to a few weeks or months, but protracted for whole years; each hour, each moment of the day is not only devoted to miſery, but the night, that calm ſeaſon of repoſe, is conſumed in weeping vigils over their fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward offspring, whoſe ceaſeleſs cries can ſcarcely be lulled to reſt even by the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment they ſeem to demand.</p>
            <p>What ſhall we ſay of the trouble and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude we have occaſioned during the lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering hours of ſickneſs, to which infancy is ſo frequently expoſed? And really in proportion as our tender limbs expand, as we advance in growth, we appear in more danger of dropping out of exiſtence; for every effort which nature makes in unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our corporeal faculties, ſeems as if ſhe would deprive us of the little life which feebly animates us. What uneaſineſs we give them, when our teeth (the ſmalleſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030594_0055_0FE7F50865568090"/>of the body) begin to pierce through the gums, and collect conſiſtence: At this criſis we are reduced to a ſtate of rapid decline and weakneſs, which awaken every apprehenſion for our ſafety. While we were thus ſuſpended between life and death, what could equal the ſorrows of our parents, or what lively pencil could have even ſketched their feelings? Overwhelmed with grief, bereft of every conſolation, they had only power to wring their hands; to raiſe their dim eyes towards heaven; to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Divine Aſſiſtance; and offer up the moſt ardent and ſincere petitions for our ſafety.</p>
            <p>After having miraculouſly eſcaped the numberleſs dangers which attend our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, we arrive at an age in which the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of mind and body demand new vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and cares of a more elevated and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature; I mean thoſe which relate to the ſoul, to the underſtanding, and which have for their main object our future edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. What new and infinite obligations we contract at this period with our parents?
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030594_0056_0FE7F50F1D518DE0"/>eſpecially if Providence has given us pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents truly worthy of this name: Parents, who, beſides ſupplying us with food, and beſtowing that attention we ſtood in need of in our helpleſs years, conſider theſe as no more than a ſmall part of their duty, ſhould they neglect to improve our minds with neceſſary inſtruction in youth: Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who, convinced of our real intereſt, embrace betimes the means of making us happy: Parents, who, perſuaded that all the wealth they may leave their children is, by no means, to be compared to virtue and a good education, have nothing ſo much at heart as forming their principles: Parents who continually inculcate theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truths, viz. that not all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of fortune, perſon, or figure, an ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us truly happy and meritorious, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the virtues of the heart and good qualities of the mind: Parents, in fine, who, imitating the example of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man lady, whom we had occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, look upon their children as their ornament, their pride, and their glory: If, I ſay, Providence has given us ſuch
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030594_0057_0FE7F510B2A299C8"/>parents, then we ſhould eſteem ourſelves happy indeed, and return perpetual bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for our highly favoured condition: it is then we ſhould acknowledge the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and magnitude of the benefits for which we are indebted to them: it is then they eſtabliſh the baſis and motives of a gratitude which our whole life is not capable of repaying them. This gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in fact, ſhould ariſe from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they render us: the more noble and generous theſe ſervices are, the greater and more extenſive ſhould be our acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But as the ſoul, the reaſon, and underſtanding are infinitely ſuperior to the body, it follows, that our gratitude for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which relate to them, ſhould be as much more eminent, as they are exalted above the body.</p>
            <p>And truly our parents, in giving us life, in taking care of our infancy, in ſupplying us with the neceſſary food for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and preſervation of exiſtence, have only acquitted themſelves of the duties which are common to all parents reſpecting
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030594_0058_0FE7F51744D71708"/>their children; but by miniſtering to our reaſon and judgment the proper food of the mind; by preſenting us with the means of inſtruction; by laying within our hearts, foundations which only can ſupport the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and cement the happineſs of our lives, I mean the valuable advantages of a ſolid and virtuous education, they gain an aſcendancy over our feelings, and claim a right to our acknowledgments, which, under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, we cannot with-hold; a right as juſt and indiſputable, as the motives upon which it is founded are pure and unchangeable. The care they take to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate our underſtanding, and form our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is a kind of ſecond birth, for which we are infinitely more indebted than for the firſt.</p>
            <p>It is evident then, from every reaſon which we are about to explain, that we are under great obligations to our parents, and that we have certain duties towards them to fulfil. Before we enter into a detail of theſe duties, in order to give them more efficacy, it is expedient to treat on the power of parents over their children,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030594_0059_0FE7F518DE0F4060"/>and point out the foundation and extent of their authority, with reſpect to us. Let us begin by conſulting the hiſtoric page, and ſee if at all times, and in all governments, the ſame ideas have been conceived on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>The Lacedemonians, we have obſerved, gave, according to their laws, the greateſt authority to parents, not only over their own children, but, in general, over all others whatſoever; ſo that, in this repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, the children were under the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all fathers, who had the privilege of reproving, correcting, and chaſtiſing them, without making any complaint to their real parents.</p>
            <p>We read in Perſian hiſtory, that fathers had the power of life and death over their children. At Rome, the law granted them the ſame right; and alſo that of ſelling and diſpoſing of them as they judged proper.</p>
            <p>If in our modern governments, the laws do not grant ſuch an unlimited authority to
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030594_0060_0FE7F51F52AACB18"/>parents, it is not therefore to be imagined that they aim at diminiſhing a tittle of that authority which is proper and eſſential to them. They are granted ſuch ſufficient powers and privileges as intitle them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, to command, to reprove and correct us by every means which they may deem fit and neceſſary. Such an authority juſtly belongs to them: nothing can deprive them of it, or prevail on them to give it up: they hold it from God, who has entruſted them with it, and ordained that they ſhould exerciſe it over us. Hence it follows, that the duty of children towards their parents is, to love, honour, and obey them; to ſhew them, on all occaſions, every mark of ſubmiſſion and reſpect; to repay their cares; to teſtify to them their gratitude; to aſſiſt, ſuccour, and procure them every comfort and conſolation in their power.</p>
            <p>The duty of reſpect towards parents is not only impoſed on us by man, but God himſelf hands it down to us as an abſolute command; ſo that we cannot fail therein without offending, at the ſame time, againſt
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030594_0061_0FE7F520E9DD1E08"/>both divine and human laws. If we open the Scriptures, we ſhall there ſee that of all the precepts which God has laid down for man, there is none ſo particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him as filial duty; nor is there any of ſuch importance if attended to, nor of ſuch fatal conſequences if neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is the only one to the obſervance of which even temporal happineſs is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed: <hi>Honour your father and mother,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he, <hi>that your days may be long in the land;</hi> ſo that a long and happy life is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us, as the fruit and reward of the honour and reſpect rendered our parents. The ſame principle generally prevails in the Holy Scripture: this duty, throughout that ſacred volume, is enjoined us, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely commanded: we every where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve there the moſt copious bleſſings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to children who are dutiful, and the moſt dreadful curſes pronounced againſt thoſe who are diſobedient to their parents. Even in this life we often ſee theſe male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions fall on the guilty head, for we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom obſerve youth thrive or proſper, who have given ſorrow and affliction to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030594_0062_0FE7F52755318980"/>by a ſpirit of obſtinacy, want of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, and indocility. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly remarked, that this froward diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a ſource of bitterneſs and misfortune which make them unhappy during their lives, unhappy in their marriages, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in their wives, unhappy in their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and particularly unhappy in their children, who purſue, with reſpect to them, the ſame line of conduct which they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by former perverſeneſs and irreverence to their parents; and who alſo, like them, are untractable, diſobedient, undutiful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, enemies to labour and application, and addicted to the company of libertines and ſpendthrifts.</p>
            <p>To be convinced of the truth of the ſubject we here treat on, let us reflect on the manner we may be diſpoſed, when we enter the habitation of a family.— What ideas do we naturally conceive on the occaſion, and what objects occupy our attention? We firſt caſt a glance on the parents and children; examine their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; ſee if order and duty are obſerved
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:030594_0063_0FE7F5291260BE10"/>by them; if the father and mother are in poſſeſſion of that authority which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them; if they are reſpected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and obeyed; if the children keep within the bounds preſcribed them; if they keep their conduct equally remote from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fear, and that freedom which degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates into licentiouſneſs; if they preſerve a demeanour which at once declares both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and filial love; if, in the whole tenor of their behaviour they are influenced by duty, and dread nothing ſo much as giving them the leaſt cauſe of umbrage or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; if they eſtabliſh the empire of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, peace, harmony, and reciprocal love; if they ſhew good example, excite an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to labour, and the ſtudy of virtue; if they purſue the paths of decency, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and rectitude of manners, which are the effects of a good education; if all this is preſented to my view, the delightful ſcene awakens my ſenſibility, flatters my fineſt feelings, and charms the pureſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of my ſoul; I enjoy it with ſecret ſatisfaction, and dwell on it with ineffable delight. Retiring with the utmoſt eſteem
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030594_0064_0FE7F52FA640BD68"/>and reſpect for this family, I offer up the moſt favourable oriſons for its wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and earneſtly pray that the bleſſing of heaven may deſcend on each individual belonging to it.</p>
            <p>If, on the contrary, the reverſe of the above, unhappily meets my view; if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are without authority; if the children have thrown off obedience, and diſregard the parental voice; if each wiſhes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his own maſter, and follow the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of his own will and caprice; if peace, union, and friendſhip do not reign among them; if the voice of diſcord and anarchy is only heard in the houſe; if they become inattentive to the admonitions they receive; if they manifeſt an averſion to ſtudy, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and application; if they have no taſte but for pleaſure and diſſipation; if they take no pains to reform their lives and mend their manners; if, I ſay, ſuch a ſcene ſtrikes my view, it inſtantly diſguſts me; I find myſelf in a ſituation that wounds my feelings, and I haſten to quit a houſe in
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030594_0065_0FE7F531422BC940"/>which I ſee nothing but the gloomy reign of diſorder and diſtraction.</p>
            <p>All concur to eſtabliſh the noble and great precept of reſpect and obedience to parents: there is no difference on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject between one nation and another, or between the poliſhed and ſavage; all men have the ſame ideas on this head; it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſpeaks to the human heart; and if we find ſome individuals who refuſe to liſten to, and acknowledge her voice, they are monſters in human ſhape.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken of the duties we owe our parents, we may proceed to examine thoſe of brothers and ſiſters, to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—We may recollect here, that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates had been accuſtomed to compare brothers and ſiſters to the twin members of the human body; that is to ſay, to the eyes, to the hands, and to the feet. This compariſon is well adapted to the ſubject under diſcuſſion, and gives us a juſt and natural idea of the manner in which the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030594_0066_0FE7F537DBFBA2A0"/>children of a well-regulated family ſhould conduct themſelves to one another. The meaning of Socrates is clearly expreſſed by this compariſon. He gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the ſame harmony, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and agreement which nature has eſtabliſhed between our members, ſhould ſubſiſt between brothers and ſiſters; as we cannot conceive a greater union than that of the hands or the feet; ſo nature, religion, and reaſon alſo combine to impoſe on bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters the duty of a ſtrict, ſincere, and indiſſoluble union. As there is but one maſter or head in a family to direct and conduct it, ſo in like manner the members of our body are ſubject to one and the ſame head to regulate and govern the whole: they ſhould, therefore, like the hands and feet, have but one and the ſame inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concord, object, and manner of acting.</p>
            <p>Friendſhip as pure, as unchangeable as the ties of kindred which bind them to one another, ſhould reign amongſt them. Look around, and you may obſerve this union kept up throughout all nature. If we are
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030594_0067_0FE7F539749CCFA0"/>naturally diſpoſed to form connections with perſons with whom perchance we have paſſed our juvenile days; if the recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them preſents to our minds ſome pleaſing ideas; and we are overjoyed and tranſported at ſeeing them, when oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offers; How much more fond and endearing muſt be the connection between brothers and ſiſters! Children of the ſame parents; reared on the ſame boſom; fed at the ſame table; and lodged under the ſame roof: they have paſſed their happieſt days together, the days of innocence and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: the firſt office of their tender limbs was to embrace one another: they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated their dawning ſentiments of joy and friendſhip at an early ſeaſon: they paſſed entire days in ſports and paſtimes ſuitable to their age: they mutually felt the ſame pleaſure, pain, joy, and melancholy: their ſorrows were diminiſhed from the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they adminiſtered to one another, and their joys increaſed from the ſatisfaction they felt in ſharing them: they had the ſame friends and the ſame enemies: they united with the former, and defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030594_0068_0FE7F5402D897498"/>againſt the latter, to whom their union rendered them formidable. They have been educated in the ſame principles, in the ſame religion, in the ſame precepts, in the ſame ſchools, and under the ſame maſters.</p>
            <p>What more powerful motives could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine to eſtabliſh a ſolid and permanent union among mankind! From this friendſhip, which ſhould ſubſiſt between brothers and ſiſters, naturally proceed other duties; for inſtance, they ſhould ſupport and aſſiſt one another by their reciprocal kind offices and good counſel, with candour, charity, and tenderneſs. This conduct will at once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them ſucceſs, and ſtrengthen their powers. The following relation proves the juſtneſs of the aſſertion. "A king, at the point of death, ſent for his children, who were very numerous: he preſented to them, in turn, a bundle of ſmall ſticks, deſiring each to break them all together: it was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by every one of them individually, but could not be done. The father took the bundle in his hand, untied it, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030594_0069_0FE7F541C73CDFF0"/>broke the ſticks one by one. He then embraced the opportunity of telling them their ſituation might be compared to the bundle of ſticks: while they were united they would be ſtrong and invincible; but the moment they were diſunited, they would become feeble, and the mere butt of their enemies."</p>
            <p>In fact, there is nothing equal to unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and a good underſtanding between brothers and ſiſters. By that bond, one of them acts with the vigour of all; for if there be two or ſeven united, each of them is no more than one individual; and in theſe ſeven you will find but one, and in one you will find ſeven. Should one be in need of aſſiſtance, he is not therefore in diſtreſs; he is powerful in the greater par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, namely, the ſix others; and the party that falls, is inſtantly ſupported, the weaker by the ſtronger. Each of them ſees, not only with his own eyes, but even with thoſe of others; he not only walks on his own feet, but alſo on thoſe of others; he not only works with his own hands, but
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030594_0070_0FE7F54875633898"/>with thoſe of others; he is not alone the guardian of his own affairs, others alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them. It is thus that union cements ſociety, and that one individual becomes many.</p>
            <p>Such is the beauty of this virtue, that it renders happy and proſperous thoſe fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which poſſeſs it; and that it contributes infinitely more to their felicity than their wealth and riches. Wherever it exiſts, there is order, peace, and harmony; where it is not, there is trouble, confuſion, and diſorder. The eſſential duty of brothers and ſiſters is, to eſtabliſh union and frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs among themſelves, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to avoid every thing that may diſturb or overturn them. In a family, every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould conſider himſelf as a part of the whole, to which he belongs; and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſtrength of the whole eſſentially conſiſt in the union and agreement of the parts which compoſe it, and which ſhould all tend to the ſame purpoſe, that of peace, utility, and public proſperity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:030594_0071_0FE7F54A12CC9B58"/>
One of the moſt effectual means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this union, is to ſuppreſs, in time, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, controverſy, and bickering in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which, from trifles in the beginning, might end badly, and terminate even in open and ſcandalous ruptures. We ſhould recollect that as great rivers flow from ſmall ſources, in like manner mighty affairs ariſe from trivial cauſes. If theſe ſtrifes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which are raiſed in certain families, and which appear to have been always a wall of ſeparation between them, be traced back to their firſt origin, we ſhould be juſtly aſtoniſhed to ſee ſuch weak motives produce ſuch dire effects. As thoſe diſeaſes of the body which communicate, and gradually approach its neighbouring parts, attack and corrupt them, are the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and inſtantly demand the aſſiſtance of the phyſician, in order to preſerve the ſound members; ſo, in like manner, when any offence is given, or miſunderſtanding takes place between families, they ſhould ſuppreſs it in time, by checking its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and ſtifling it in its birth, to prevent
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030594_0072_0FE7E928B10531C0"/>the evil from increaſing, and to preſerve the union of the whole.</p>
            <p>What we advance here concerning bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters, may be equally applied to others, as we ſhall find it to be the caſe, in pointing out the duties we are obliged to perform as members of ſociety, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom of the world. Theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are compriſed in two plain precepts, which are the foundation and ſummary of all morality: <hi>Do unto others as you would they ſhould do unto you; and Do not unto them what you would not they ſhould do unto you.</hi> Theſe two maxims, well conſidered, give us an idea and knowledge of the obligations we have to fulfil in the commerce of civil life. One is in the affirmative, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; the other is negative, and forbids. By the firſt, we are enjoined <hi>to do unto others what we would they ſhould do unto us;</hi> that is to ſay, we ſhould procure for others every good which we wiſh they ſhould render us; treat them as we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire they ſhould treat us; act on the ſame
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030594_0073_0FE7F550B316DB80"/>principles towards them, as we expect they ſhould act to us; and have the ſame regards, cares, officiouſneſs, and attentions for them, which we require they ſhould have for us. By the ſecond, we are forbid <hi>to do to others what we would not they ſhould do unto us;</hi> that is to ſay, by putting ourſelves in the ſituation of others, and judging of them by ourſelves, we ſhould avoid doing them any injury which we would not have done to ourſelves; or committing the ſame offences, and doing the ſame wrongs to them, which we would not wiſh them to do unto us. Theſe principles are certain, ſimple, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; they are the foundation and cement of all human ſociety; they ſhould then be a rule of conduct to govern us in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with mankind in general, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe with whom we live and have the moſt intimate connection.</p>
            <p>Before we proceed further in the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe precepts, it would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to examine here the nature of ſociety, and what is ſignified by the term.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:030594_0074_0FE7F5525BE6C2E0"/>
Society is an union of many individuals, who preſerve their exiſtence by the mutual aſſiſtance they lend one another, and the connections which unite them together. God, the great author of our nature, having formed it in ſuch a manner, that it is inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in itſelf, or in a ſolitary ſtate, he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that it ſhould be ſupported by other aid. He has ſo wiſely diſpoſed all things, that the mutual helps derived from ſociety make ample amends for all our wants and inſufficiency. He has therefore given us this one world ſolely for our habitation: he has created one ſun to give light to the world: he has extended the heavens as one ſpacious canopy to cover us. Wherefore do we build cities, houſes, and public ſquares, but to be united together, not only by the ſame habitation, but ſtill more by the ties of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and like the conſtituent parts of one and the ſame body. The moral is juſtly aſſimilated to the natural body of each individual, which is compoſed of many members that aid and ſupport one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the faithful diſcharge of that duty which Providence has aſſigned to
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030594_0075_0FE7F5590266EDE0"/>each: the feet ſuſtain; the hands act; the eyes ſee; the ears hear; and ſo on. Let us now ſuppoſe that theſe different mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers deny the ſervices which nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; that the feet remain in a ſtate of inaction; the hands without motion; the teeth without diſcharging their function; What would be the conſequence of ſuch diſorder, if not certain death and a total deſtruction of theſe different parts? Thus it would be with the body of ſociety, if all the individuals, who are its members, ſhould refuſe their reciprocal aid, and interrupt the mutual communication. They would remain in a ſtate of torpor and inaction. Such a derangement would neceſſarily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the diſſolution of the whole body. As edifices are built with ſtones faſtened by the cement which unites them; and as the moment a chaſm is made by the failure of the ſtones, the whole ſtructure tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles into ruins; in like manner, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the human ſpecies entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the union, agreement, and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of the parts. Without union and good order, no government can be well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030594_0076_0FE7F55A992D01E0"/>no city can be well governed, no houſes well arranged, and no family well reguated. The ſpirit of union and peace is then the firſt duty impoſed on us in ſociety. This ſpirit is the more neceſſary to us, as our intereſts are connected with thoſe of the public, and ſo blended with them, that when theſe are injured, ours ſuffer in the ſame proportion; ſo that our private advantages and welfare oblige us to be peaceable, humane, gentle, patient, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, moderate, friendly, juſt, benevolent, and, in ſhort, to poſſeſs every quality which contributes to good order, and maintains the union of ſociety; that is to ſay, <hi>we ought to do unto others as we would they ſhould do unto us; and we ought not to do unto others what we do not wiſh they ſhould do unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe general principles, we now enter into a detail, which will render theſe truths more obvious, and give us a more particular and practical knowledge of the duties which we have to perform to others. Let us begin by acknowledging here what
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030594_0077_0FE7F560ED3DF478"/>is unhappily too true, that we all have our foibles. Of theſe, humanity, in its neareſt approaches to perfection, is by no means diveſted. The great and low, the rich and poor, the young and old, have, all, their imperfections. Notwithſtanding any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums that may be beſtowed on us; any adulation we may ſwallow; any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions we may have concerning our pretended merit; and the favourable opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we may entertain in our own behalf; notwithſtanding all theſe we really have vices and imperfections. Perhaps we may not be thoroughly acquainted with them; we may not perceive them, as they really are, becauſe ſelf-love and pride, of which we have an abundant ſtock, prevent us from knowing ourſelves. But thoſe with whom we have connections in the commerce of life, and with whom we live, are perfect judges of our foibles, errors, and evil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe that we have all to reproach ourſelves with certain faults and imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that we are ſubject to ſome paſſion,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030594_0078_0FE7F56284F27AC0"/>either of pride or anger, envy or fa ſlander, calumny, or any other imperfection whatever: What follows, and what thence ſhould we conclude for our conduct in life? It follows thence that human indulgence has every right to make an allowance for human failings: We ſhould all mutually aſſiſt, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and excuſe one another. The glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of reaſon are ſufficient to convince us of the neceſſity of this rule. There is nothing indeed more natural than to believe we ſhould be treated as we treat others. If we judge without mercy, we will be judged with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity: if we make the faults of others the ſubject of our cenſures, they will not ſpare us in their animadverſions: if we are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to render them any kindneſſes, they will be ill diſpoſed to ſhow any to us: if we are bitter to them, can we expect they will be pleaſant to us? The ſpirit of ſweetneſs, moderation, prudence, diſcretion, charity, patience, goodneſs, and humanity, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily the ſpirit which ſhould actuate us in ſociety; we muſt therefore make it our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to acquire it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:030594_0079_0FE7F569302800C0"/>
Nothing can contribute to inſpire us with this ſpirit ſo much, as the knowledge of the human heart, and eſpecially that of our own. Becauſe when we perceive in others thoſe errors, of which we can trace the ſource in ourſelves, we ſhould therefore feel diſpoſed to grant them that indulgence which we, on our part, require, and thereby conduct our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves towards them with a ſweet, affable, gentle, modeſt, and ſocial temper.</p>
            <p>As this knowledge of the human heart is the conſequence of reflection and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of which youth is not capable, it is of ſome moment to aſſiſt you here in a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit ſo neceſſary in the courſe of life. You will aſk perhaps, Is every one unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with himſelf? Have we occaſion to ſtudy the knowledge of ourſelves? You believe not; but you are miſtaken; for the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is exactly true, that the generality of mankind to not know themſelves. In fact, there are few who direct their attention in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, who ſtudy themſelves, who examine their inclinations, characters, feelings, and paſſions of the heart, which are the chief
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030594_0080_0FE7F56ACBD31D68"/>rulers of their actions and their entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. We have eyes to ſee what paſſes abroad, and ſeldom conſider what paſſes within us. Hence it has been wittily remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a certain philoſopher, that we carry a ſack on our ſhoulders, in which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained our own faults, and thoſe of others: the latter are in that part of the ſack which is expoſed to view; the former are behind, and concealed in ſuch a manner that we cannot perceive them.</p>
            <p>Self-love, which domineers over us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals from us the ſecret avenues to the ſoul; makes us blind to our own failings; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents us from ſeeing ourſelves as we are, or diſcovering the faults which are really exiſting in us. It is ſometimes carried to ſuch an extreme, and gives the mind ſuch a bias, that ſome of our paſſions, which are really vicious, and deemed ſo by all thoſe who know us intimately, derive the name of virtues from ourſelves.</p>
            <p>Interrogate the avaricious man on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of avarice: aſk him what he thinks of
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030594_0081_0FE7F571385C0E08"/>the paſſion which renders him inſenſible to every pleaſure, but that of accumulating riches; which makes him gather wealth, not to uſe, but ſolely to hoard up in his coffers, and bury in the earth; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels him to deprive himſelf of common ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, through a fear of touching his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and which renders him callous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible to the miſeries of others: queſtion him on this paſſion, which debaſes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grades him, and you will perceive that he is very remote from knowing himſelf; that he conſiders himſelf a prudent and wiſe eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiſt, who provides for future wants.</p>
            <p>Interrogate the prodigal, who ruins him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and family by ſilly, thoughtleſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant expences, and you will be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to find that he aggrandizes his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion with the elevated names of generoſity, liberality, and greatneſs of ſoul.</p>
            <p>Interrogate the choleric and paſſionate man, who, in the height of his phrenzy, ſpares neither women, children, relations, nor friends, and he will tell you that in him
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:030594_0082_0FE7F572E7B77EE8"/>it is the overflowing of a ſoul fraught with candour, courage, and firmneſs.</p>
            <p>Interrogate the rich man, who affects haughty, proud, diſdainful, and arrogant manners, and you will find that he imagines theſe manners correſpond with his rank, fortune, and conſequence; and that they give him an air of grandeur in the eyes of the world.</p>
            <p>Interrogate a young lady upon her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt behaviour; her deſire of pleaſing, by ſtudied and affected cares; by the finery of her toilet, where the rules of decency and virtue are laid aſide; and by proceedings and conduct which breathe too much free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and licentiouſneſs: ſhe will tell you, that it is thus they live in the world; that what is faſhionable cannot ſeem offenſive; and, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that too much reaſon and wiſdom are not adapted to her years, which prove the ſeaſon of pleaſure. If you mention that the world ſpeaks of her; that her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuffers; that modeſty, decency, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue are the ornaments of the ſex; and that
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:030594_0083_0FE7F57985412F30"/>ſhe only becomes reſpectable by the practice of theſe virtues; your arguments will make little impreſſion on her; ſhe will continue her courſe of life; and perhaps prepare to travel the thorny road of affliction, which ſhe might have avoided, had ſhe followed your counſels.</p>
            <p>Continue to examine this ſame young perſon on her different defects; for inſtance, on her averſion for ſtudy and application. Tell her frequently that nothing is more neceſſary than to form in youth her taſte for every thing uſeful, good, great, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and generous; that the happineſs or miſery of human life abſolutely depends on the manner in which we have ſpent our youth. Tell her that nothing can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the advantages which a ſolid and well-ſupported education procures; that it tends at once to form the heart and judgment; that it enriches the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and furniſhes us with uſeful and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able information, which remains with us during life, and accompanies us through every viciſſitude; that it is the ornament of
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030594_0084_0FE7F57B1D572778"/>youth and the conſolation of age, and equally advantageous to us in ſociety or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude: in ſociety, by placing us in a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of converſing with well informed men, and vendering our mutual intercourſe more pleaſant: in ſolitude, becauſe it teaches us, with the inſtructive aid of books, to live alone. Tell her that reading eſſentially contributes to ſoften our manners, and give us a ſweet, gentle, poliſhed turn of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which endears us to ſociety; that there is no better companion than a good book, which conveys the language of truth, makes u acquainted with our imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and lays down rules of conduct and good morals. Repreſent all theſe to the young perſon of whom we ſpeak; examine her ſituation; enquire into he cauſe of her indifference to thoſe objects ſo worthy of fixing her attention; and you will diſcover that the ſource of evil is derived from her ignorance of herſelf, becauſe ſhe does not judge of herſelf from the truths which you dictate to her, but rather from the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods of ſome ſoul-deceiving flatterer who inſinuates, and inceſſantly repeats to her,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030594_0085_0FE7F581D93DAB80"/>that ſhe is beautiful and amiable; that ſhe is, in an eminent degree, poſſeſſed of wit, talents, and graces, and ſurpaſſes in charms every female of her age. She ſwallows this groſs adulation; betrays herſelf into an idea of virtues ſhe has not; grows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the vices ſhe has; and thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences the career of her future misfortunes.</p>
            <p>Judge yourſelf, and you will agree to the truth of theſe remarks. Though they were not preſented to your mind before the preſent times, they will become more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible to you as you advance in years and experience.</p>
            <p>In order to facilitate the means of your becoming acquainted with yourſelf, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for me to give you a few remarks relative to the reaſons, why the bulk of mankind do not know themſelves.</p>
            <p>By reflecting a moment on the cauſe of ſuch an effect, we ſhall perceive that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its ſource from that inexhauſtible fund of ſelf-love which we feel within us; from
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030594_0086_0FE7F5838214A760"/>the interior diſpoſition, by whi admire, and applaud ourſelves; and from the favourable opinion we entertain of every thing relating to ſelf, which induces us to prefer ourſelves to others; to exaggerate our virtues in our own eyes; and to conceal our imperfections and vices.</p>
            <p>As youth is the time in which the mind is moſt ſubject to be led aſtray, it is alſo the ſeaſon in which ſelf-love rules with moſt deſpotic power, and conſequently the period in life in which we are leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ourſelves. It is this ſelf-love, with which a young perſon is prepoſſeſſed, that makes her conceive ſo high an opinion of herſelf, and her pretended merit; and of certain perſonal advantages, merely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior, which nature has given her. It is this ſelf-love which ſo ſtrangely betrays her into the opinion ſhe foſters on the ſubject of her beauty. It is this which makes her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer trifles to ſolid and real virtues: which puts it into her head, that ſuperficial orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be ſubſtituted for every thing elſe, and take place of all other qualities.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:030594_0087_0FE7F58A08C3ED50"/>She imagines, becauſe ſhe is handſome, that ſhe has no occaſion to be modeſt, reſerved, diligent, and devoted to the cares of a good education; but that ſhe may, with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, be diſſipated, indiſcreet, fickle, coquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, trifling, immodeſt, and extravagant. It is this ſelf-love which renders her ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in the arts of pleaſing; attentive to the charms of her perſon; and regardleſs of the beauties of her mind. A prudent and experienced mother, a wiſe and virtuous friend, ſtrive in vain to expoſtulate with her, and explain her duties: in vain they tell her what renders a young perſon amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſerving; not exterior advantages, nor the graces of form and perſon, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior qualities, thoſe of the heart and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; ſweet, open, innocent, and natural manners. In vain they endeavour to give her a taſte for ſtudy, application, and uſeful employments. Regardleſs of this doctrine, ſhe wholly abandons herſelf to the ſuggeſtions of ſelf-love, and to the poiſonous diſcourſes of ſome youth, who preaches up contrary tenets; who ſtudies to pleaſe her, by telling agreeable things;
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030594_0088_0FE7F58B9A957350"/>and who feeds her fancy with a thouſand chimeras equally falſe and pernicious. It is thus that ſelf-love miſleads her; deprives her of the knowledge of her imperfections; and prevents her from embracing the means of correcting them. It would not be a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult taſk to prove that it produces the ſame effects in a more advanced age, and that mankind in general are, in a great degree, poſſeſſed of it.</p>
            <p>From what has been premiſed, follows this truth, that the knowledge of ourſelves is of the higheſt importance to us, in order that we ſhould ſet about the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and regulation of our conduct and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. In fact, it is with the maladies of the ſoul as with thoſe of the body. Why is a phyſician called to a ſick perſon, and how does he begin to exerciſe his art? His firſt care is to ſtudy the diſeaſe which he wiſhes to conquer; to diſcover the origin, cauſe, and progreſs of it; afterwards, by means of this preliminary information, he applies thoſe remedies which he deems fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. This mode of treatment is much
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:030594_0089_0FE7F593A60DF568"/>the ſame as that which we ſhould obſerve with reſpect to the diſtempered ſoul, whoſe maladies are the vices and paſſions which govern us inwardly; beſet the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and hold it in a ſort of captivity and infirmity. Now, I ſay, if we wiſh to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake their cure, the firſt thing we have to do is, to diſcover the nature of them. But how ſhall we come at this knowledge? By examining what paſſes within us; by ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the propenſities, inclinations, and diſpoſitions of the heart; by judging ourſelves without the partiality and illuſions of ſelf-love; by erecting a tribunal within, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine on all our actions; by finding out, in particular, our ruling paſſion, or the chief and main ſpring of all the reſt. When once we have made this inveſtigation, and come to the knowledge of ourſelves, it will be eaſy to make uſe of them towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of our conduct, and correct what we find imperfect, defective, and vicious in ourſelves.</p>
            <p>This ſtudy of ourſelves has been judged ſo neceſſary in all ages, that the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030594_0090_0FE7F59A32B46860"/>to be met with in one of the moſt famous temples of Greece was this; <hi>Know thyſelf: Noſce te ipſum.</hi> It would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to enumerate all the advantages this knowledge procures, and the influence in has on the happineſs of our lives.</p>
            <p>Among theſe advantages, there is one I ſhall obſerve to you here, and which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, on your part, a particular attention. It is, that the knowledge of ourſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes eſſentially to that of others: it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us capable of judging their actions, and valuing them according to their worth. In fact, we have all nearly the ſame incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and the ſame mixture of good and evil. The different good and bad qualities are modified more or leſs in every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, according to circumſtances; but the feelings, the receſſes of the heart are the ſame; ſo that the knowledge of our own paſſions ſummarily repreſents to us thoſe of others, and makes us capable of judging them. Obſerve that I do not ſpeak here of a certain deſcription of men, who ſeem born for the commiſſion of crimes, and are
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030594_0091_0FE7F59BCB79F148"/>a ſcandal and diſgrace to humanity. Such beings are monſters in nature; and it is not by monſters that we are to judge of a whole ſpecies.</p>
            <p>I repeat to you, that the ſubject which is here offered to you, namely, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of mankind, merits your attention; and the obſervations you are about to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, may be of great utility in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of life; in forming your judgment; enabling you to diſtinguiſh real merit from appearances; and giving you a juſt idea of virtue.</p>
            <p>Let us begin by advancing, that we are not to conſider man in the ſame point of view we do a picture. The beauty of the latter, the proportion, the judicious blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of light and ſhade, are almoſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the firſt glance: We ſhould be groſsly miſtaken to judge thus of man, on our firſt interview. It is the heart we muſt ſound and fathom; but the bottom of it we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom can reach on our firſt attempt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:030594_0092_0FE7F5A29BF48A38"/>
We may conſider man here in a twofold capacity: in one, as confined to private life, in the company of his wife, children, and domeſtics: in the other, as mingling with ſociety, for buſineſs, for pleaſure, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling the exterior obligations of his office, or diſcharging the duties of decorum. The premiſes being admitted, in order to come to a knowledge of him, in which of theſe two conditions is he to be examined? Is it in the latter, that is to ſay, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in public? No—not at all: That is not the proper time for forming an idea of his character. Why ſo? Becauſe it often happens, that we only then ſee his exterior or outſide. He is, as it were, out of his ſphere, and ſo little like himſelf, that if you compare him in theſe two ſituations, you will rather ſuppoſe that there are two diſtinct individuals in queſtion, than one and the ſame man placed in different points of view. Let us explain our meaning, and endeavour to render this truth obvious. Man, when expoſed to the public eye, puts on the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of virtues he does not poſſeſs. He ſtudies his manners, frames his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:030594_0093_0FE7F5A435263F38"/>culls his words, and acts in ſuch a manner as to give his whole exterior an air of virtue: he practiſes every art on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: he maſks and conceals his real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: ſhe impoſes ſilence on his paſſions; affects a countenance which prepoſſeſſes, and diſpoſes the mind to judge favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of him: ſo that if you examine him only in this point of view, and without going further, you cannot help forming of man in general, the moſt advantageous ideas. You will confound, in your own opinion, the good man with the wicked, becauſe both ſpeak the ſame language, that of virtue; both expreſs the ſame ſentiments of piety, gentleneſs goodneſs, benevolence, humanity, juſtice, modeſty, temperance, and love of the public good; and both reſemble each other in words. No compariſon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can be made between them; and the diſtance which ſeparates them is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe as that between heaven and earth; becauſe the one acts the hypocrite, and plays a part which is not his own; the other acts naturally and from principle, and proves that his exterior correſponds with
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030594_0094_0FE7F5AABA89A820"/>his interior, by the agreement of his and ſentiments. But this difference, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever great, will not become ſenſible to you, if you conſider them only under certain cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and by their diſcourſe; as in reality all men are nearly ſimilar to each other in theſe particulars. But in what are they unlike each other, and in what do they eſſentially differ? In their actions, their conduct, and their morals.</p>
            <p>It is only in this point of view we ſhould judge of a man, in order to know him, and eſtimate his real merit. Hence we have but to examine him, when he is reſtored to himſelf, and moves in his natural ſphere; for inſtance, when he is at home, in his houſe, in the centre of his family, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, eating, and drinking with his wife and children, and ordering his domeſtics. It is there, as Plato remarks, that he acts either well or ill: it is there the maſk falls off, the heart and inclinations appear without diſguiſe, and the man as he really is. Why ſo? you will ſay. Becauſe a man, when at
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:030594_0095_0FE7F5AC56BA7370"/>home, has nothing to check, reſtrain him, or alter the features of his character. He practiſes every art in the preſence of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but that reſtraint ceaſes in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of thoſe with whom he reſides, and who are accuſtomed to ſee him, to hear him, and obſerve his daily actions.</p>
            <p>This method of proceeding, in order to become acquainted with the human heart, is the reſult of reaſon and experience, which point it out as the one moſt certain, and leaſt ſubject to error. Yet it is not the mode which is commonly followed. The generality of mankind judge from exterior, deceitful, and falſe appearances. Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed as we are in favour of honour and riches, we are naturally diſpoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive advantageous ideas of thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them. We are apt to believe that a man's merit is in proportion to his fortune; and that the opulent have claims to our eſteem, to which the lower orders have no pretenſions. When your mind takes ſuch a wrong bias it concerns you to be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:030594_0096_0FE7F5920BF23270"/>and to acquire juſt ideas of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic value of things. A little reflection is ſufficient for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Is it not truly aſtoniſhing, that in the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of men we follow a courſe quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which ſerves as a ſtandard, by which we value all other things exiſting in nature, and that man is the only being we judge of from falſe principles? When we have occaſion to buy any thing for our own uſe, what qualities do we require in the ſort we want? Are theſe qualities merely exterior? Do we conſider interior excellence as nothing? If, for example, we have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for a horſe, how do we proceed in our choice? Do we examine only the finery of the bridle, ſaddle, and trappings? On the contrary, do we not ſtrip him of all theſe, in order to ſee him naked, and ſuch as he really is? Do we not make trial of him? Do we not obſerve his gait in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, trotting, pacing, &amp;c. in order to be aſſured of his qualities, and to find out thoſe which conſtitute a good horſe? Take a view of every object which occurs in the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:030594_0097_0FE7F5B2CE9DCE58"/>commerce of life, and you may obſerve, that we conſtantly purſue this mode of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding which is dictated by the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſentiments of wiſdom, prudence, and good ſenſe. We never ſay that a ſword is good, becauſe it has a fine ſcabbard; nor that a houſe is ſolid, becauſe it has a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome outſide. We do not buy, as they ſay, a pig in a bag. Why do we not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame rule with reſpect to man? He is rich, you ſay; he is powerful; he has high birth and dignity. Agreed: but all theſe do not conſtitute himſelf: they are merely exterior. In order to know him, I ſhould ſtrip him of all theſe; examine himſelf only, and ſuch as he is, excluſive of all that ſurrounds him, his pomp and titles. I ſhall therefore conſider if he poſſeſſes the virtues of his condition; if he fulfils the duties of his ſtation; if he fills it with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and intregity; if he is a good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, a good father, a good friend; if proſperity does not render him proud and inſolent; adverſity, creeping and ſervile; if he is religious, good, friendly, modeſt, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, patient, and moderate. If he has, in
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030594_0098_0FE7F5B46468D8B8"/>ſhort, the qualities of a meritorious man. If I find that his ſoul is endued with theſe virtues, he is then in poſſeſſion of real riches; riches which are preferable to the world's wealth. If, on the contrary, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in him a ſoul plunged in vice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed with paſſions, low ſentiments, and a continual oppoſition to the principles of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, goodneſs, juſtice, and moderation, then he appears to me poor indeed, and truly contemptible, if he had all the opulence, grandeur, and treaſures of Croeſus.</p>
            <p>Were I to ſpeak of the conduct of a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, I would canvaſs it in the ſame manner. I do not aſk if ſhe is fond of appearing in ſociety and in polite circles; of ſhewing away in public; of diſplaying her pomp, luxury, and expence; if the cares of the toilet take up a part of her time; or, if ſhe is rich in jewels and exterior ornaments? I do not aſk theſe things, nor any other queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this nature. I only enquire if ſhe has the virtues of her condition? If, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely attached to her huſband, ſhe limits all her deſires to pleaſe him? If, attentive
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030594_0099_0FE7F5BAE7D81E78"/>to the employments which nature aſſigned her, ſhe orders and governs her domeſtic affairs, at the ſame time that ſhe attends to thoſe abroad? If, in her family, ſhe has an eye to every thing becoming her ſex, and acts in ſuch a manner as to produce order, union and proſperity, and that the different members which conſtitute it, perform their reſpective duties, and contribute to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and beauty of the whole? If, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within the domeſtic circle, ſhe knows how to inſpire her children with awe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and filial live? If ſhe devotes her moſt precious moments to the care of their education? If ſhe conſiders this care as the firſt and moſt indiſpenſable of all duties? If ſhe makes her happineſs, glory, and higheſt conſolation conſiſt in theſe? Theſe are the points upon which I ſhould examine her; theſe her obligations, and the virtues which form the merit of her character.</p>
            <p>I ſhall treat a young lady in the ſame manner. I ſhall not conſider if ſhe is hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, or in what degree ſhe poſſeſſes the charms of perſon; if ſhe is a coquette, and
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030594_0100_0FE7F5BC872B3480"/>only employed in the vanity of dreſs, and the arts of pleaſing; or, if ſhe attends every aſſembly and party of pleaſure? but I ſhall conſider, if ſhe has qualities becoming her years; if ſhe receives a good education; if ſhe profits thereby; and, if chaſtity, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, evenneſs of temper, ſolid underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reflection, and application fall to her lot?</p>
            <p>Such is the rule which leads me to the knowledge of any perſon whatever, high or low, rich or poor, young or old. I will judge and value him according to his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and perſonal qualities, and not by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and ſuppoſed virtues. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examine, if he properly diſcharges the duties of his ſtation; the obligations which relate to his age, ſituation, talents, and rank; for in this line of conduct conſiſts the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of man. It conſtitutes his merit; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes him from others; and renders him truly eſtimable. And what is virtue, but the accompliſhment of the duties of that ſtate in which Providence has placed us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:030594_0101_0FE7F5C304B8B998"/>
What follows from theſe obſervations, and what concluſions ſhould you draw from them for your conduct in life? You ſhould infer, that ſince they are the only virtues that can render us praiſe-worthy, you ſhould, in your judgment, give them the preference to all other advantages. You ſhould endeavour to acquire and practiſe them; and not to be content with their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but really to poſſeſs them; not to paſs for a virtuous character, but to be truly ſo; and, finally, to become thoroughly acquainted with your obligations, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharge them.</p>
            <p>You are ſenſible that this article treats of the third claſs of duties which we have to perform here below, thoſe which regard ourſelves, and are perſonal. God grant that I may here inſpire you with thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, impreſs them on your minds, and deeply grave them on your hearts. That you may benefit thereby, I ſhall endeavour to give you a juſt idea of virtue; and after you have been convinced that it is the only quality which renders us truly worthy, I
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030594_0102_0FE7F5C49B6E5AA8"/>will alſo prove to you, that it is the only one that makes us happy even here on earth.</p>
            <p>I flatter myſelf that you will be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of it, if you will favour me with your attention. What motive more powerful to attach you to your duties, than that of your own intereſt and happineſs. The genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of children conſider them as a hard and painful taſk. The very name of virtue fills their minds with gloomy and unpleaſant ideas: they ſuppoſe it to be a nauſeous and bitter draught, made up of a medley of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients. As the conduct and government of life almoſt entirely depend on firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and the ſentiments formed in youth, it is of the higheſt importance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the prejudices you may have conceived on the ſubject of virtue, to bring you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, and to convince you that far from being bitter or unpleaſant, it is, on the contrary, the ſource of true felicity, the parent of ſolid pleaſures, and the road which leads us to true enjoyments, to peace and tranquillity of mind and heart. Follow me, I intreat you.</p>

We all wiſh to be happy: it is the firſt deſire of every reaſonable creature: it is the common ambition of all men: it is the end of their labours, and the main object of their purſuits. Yes: Mankind ſigh after what they call happineſs, and ſtrive to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. But do they diſcover this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they are in queſt of, and do they all equally enjoy it? By no means. And why not? Becauſe few ſeek it where it is; but many purſue it where it is not. Some indeed imagine that it ſolely conſiſts in the poſſeſſion of wealth, and uſe every means to obtain riches. Some placing it in the pleaſure of the ſenſes, give themſelves up entirely to the gratification of their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Others, in fine, perſuaded that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue alone can make them happy, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to it, and make it the rule of their conduct. I now aſk you, Which are they who appear to you the moſt wiſe and prudent in their purſuits? Are they thoſe votaries of fortune, or theſe ſlaves of their pleaſures and paſſions? Not at all; they are neither the one nor the other, though you might have ſuppoſed ſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030594_0104_0FE7F5CCC1AED8E0"/>But it is time to undeceiv give you ſome juſt conceptions of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>And firſt, I muſt remark, that riches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not of themſelves conſtitute real happineſs. In fact, whatever prepoſſeſſions we may have for wealth and honours, they are, notwithſtanding, no more than a vapour that vaniſhes, a mere ſhadow, that attracts but to mock us in its ſudden flight. Riches are not centred in us; neither are they the whole, nor a part of us. They are outward appendages, merely accidental to us. We may be men of integrity and virtue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poſſeſſing them. Wealth may fall to the lot of the wicked; and too frequently they purchaſe it at a dear price, the price of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and probity. It cannot communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to us thoſe qualities which alone are eſſential to man, I mean, piety, juſtice, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, goodneſs, &amp;c. Theſe virtues are independent of riches: they may be met with in the cottage of the poor, as well as in the palace of the great. To render the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:030594_0105_0FE7F5D3448BD950"/>truth of theſe principles more obvious to you, let us make this ſimple and natural ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe two youths, the one the child of wealthy, the other of indigent parents; conceive the former, a haughty, arrogant, untractable, ignorant, idle young man, without piety towards God; without reſpect to his parents; addicted to ſwearing, lying, and every vice which ſprings from a bad heart and corrupt ſoul. Suppoſe the latter a virtuous youth, who fears God; is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive to his parents; docile to his ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors; modeſt in his converſation; regular in his morals; fond of induſtry, ſtudy, and application; endued with every virtue adapted to his age; and worthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a model to all his acquaintance. The compariſon admitted, I now aſk you, which of the two would you wiſh to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate? Does the condition of the fortunate youth, with his vices and imperfections, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you preferable to that of the poor lad, with his virtues? Does the one, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:030594_0106_0FE7F5D4DD82B3E8"/>of his riches, ſeem to you more eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable, more happy, or a greater object of envy than the other, on account of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty? In ſhort, were you to be one of them, and the freedom of choice to be given you, in whoſe favour would you determine? In favour of the poor young man, you reply, without heſitation. I thought ſo beforehand, and you are in the right of it; becauſe he enjoys the only true riches, thoſe alone which eſtabliſh the merit of a man; thoſe alone which are worthy of our praiſe and eſteem. Inſtead of theſe, the other, with all his wealth and pretenſions, is no more than a coxcomb, who only claims our contempt and indignation. It is evident, you ſee, that riches do not make us happy.</p>
            <p>I do not, however, mean to ſay, that riches are intrinſically evil. This is by no means the idea I wiſh to convey. But I would give you to underſtand, that they are in themſelves of no moment. Like beauty or bodily ſtrength, they are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments either of good or evil: they are not ſufficient to make us happy and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030594_0107_0FE7F5DB85375F78"/>they can only be rendered ſo, when converted to good purpoſes.</p>
            <p>If riches cannot procure happineſs for man, the pleaſures of the ſenſes are ſtill leſs capable. In fact, God, in creating us, has mingled in our very exiſtence the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of equity, modeſty, and the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent virtues neceſſary to conduct us to that end for which we were intended. We were born with a taſte and diſpoſition for order and virtue: hence it happens, that when we abandon ourſelves to our unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and unruly paſſions, we overturn that order eſtabliſhed by nature and God himſelf; we act in contradiction to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and conſequently we become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy. This is truly the caſe, and it is confirmed by daily experience. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly paſſions, far from contributing to our felicity, are even the ſource of our ſorrows. Vice is attended with trouble, anxiety, and uneaſineſs. It ſubdues the ſoul but to baniſh peace and repoſe. It is like a running ulcer, which corrodes the heart. The guilty are puniſhed in the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030594_0108_0FE7F5DD1AD28BF0"/>of their crimes, by the pangs of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs remorſe, which wring the tortured ſoul. Man, in a criminal ſtate, is his own execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner; and in proportion as he indulges in lawleſs pleaſures, he creates within his own boſom, as it were, an oppoſite chagrin, which daſhes the cup of joy with bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and torments him in a thouſand ſhapes.</p>
            <p>But if it be thus as you tell me, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleaſures nor riches can make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, where then muſt we ſeek felicity?</p>
            <p>Where ſeek it? In piety, virtue, and the practice and performance of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This is the great ſecret of happineſs; learn it then here; engrave it deeply on your hearts; and never forget, that our happineſs is placed in virtue only, and that a pure conſcience is the ſource of true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, the parent of real felicity, and the remedy for all troubles; becauſe it puts us in poſſeſſion of ſolid and permanent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. Riches delude us with ideas of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent good, and at beſt are periſhable. The malice of man may deprive us of them;
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030594_0109_0FE7F5E3A6C91F78"/>the paſſions may ſwallow them up; the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of fortune may turn them into other hands; and death at leaſt, ſooner or later, will compel us to part with them. But piety, juſtice, goodneſs, charity, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, &amp;c. are the only riches which truly belong to us; the only wealth we can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and preſerve; our only ſhield againſt misfortunes and the malice of man; and our only companions through every change of life, in adverſity, in proſperity, in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in health, in old age, in youth, in death, and even beyond the grave. O happy ſtate of virtue, why not better known to man!</p>
            <p>O youth, of every denomination, in riches or poverty, if you wiſh to be happy, become virtuous; and you will then be as completely ſo as it is poſſible in this life. But then remember, you muſt begin your career on the preſent moment. Conſider (I cannot too often repeat it to you) that youth is the period which determines our ſucceſs in life, and the ſeaſon in which we ſhould lay the foundation of futurity: that
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030594_0110_0FE7F5E537DF8720"/>it is in vain to pretend we mean to become good hereafter, if we do not now give ſome proofs of our intention. Begin then in time to ſow the ſeeds of virtue in your hearts, if you would wiſh to reap their fruits in ſeaſon. Reflect that you have to conduct your whole life; a lingering ſpace, perhaps, to travel over. Imitate then the wiſe and prudent man, who has a long voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to make. He ponders thereon, and employs a conſiderable time in providing every thing neceſſary to render his voyage comfortable. Do you alſo make your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and diſpoſe of every thing in ſuch a manner, as to enable you to ſhape that unerring courſe which you have to ſteer through the ocean of life. You will meet with rocks and ſhoals in your paſſage, but you muſt take care not to ſplit on them. Imitate the wiſdom of the pilot: he does not wait till his veſſel is battered by the ſtorm, to provide what is neceſſary againſt it: he takes advantage of the calm, and makes his preparations in time. My chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the youth which you enjoy is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the calm: it concerns you much to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030594_0111_0FE7F5EBEB3C09F8"/>benefit by it. Shortly indeed the tempeſt of the paſſions will rife in your ſouls, and rage through all your ſenſes. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching hurricanes will ſink you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to a melancholy wreck, if you have not the precaution to prepare in time againſt the violence of their attacks.</p>
            <p>If you already feel the firſt approaches of the paſſions; if your heart begins to feel their firſt emotions; what muſt it be when they preſent themſelves? Labour then to bar their paſſage to your ſoul; or deſtroy them in embryo, if they are near their birth. Do not wait therefore till they have taken root, and collected vigour; for then you would have much difficulty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge them; and, almoſt in ſpite of your efforts, they would domineer and tyrannize over you.</p>
            <p>This moral you have conveyed to us, you will probably ſay, is good and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; we agree to it. The picture you have drawn of virtue renders it lovely, and removes the prejudices which might disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:030594_0112_0FE7F5ED86FA5C98"/>it in our eyes. We now paint it in the moſt lively colours. We are perſuaded, with you, that virtue alone makes man a praiſe-worthy being, and greatly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to his happineſs. The explanation you have given of the different duties we have to perform towards God, mankind, and ourſelves, is ſenſible and juſt: it has made an impreſſion on our minds: it has inſtructed us, and may be of infinite ſervice to us for the preſent, and the time to come. We have been particularly ſtruck with the force of your reaſoning, on the influence which youth has on future life, and the conſequences of the principles we receive in youth. Coinciding with you, we are entirely convinced that theſe principles cannot be inſpired or impreſſed but by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence we conclude, that a good education is abſolutely neceſſary; that it is every thing; that on it depends the fate of life; and that nothing in the world can be compared to the advantages reſulting from it. We conſent to all theſe; and we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that children, who have the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:030594_0113_0FE7F5F437C84DD0"/>of receiving a good education, ſhould embrace every means of benefiting by it. But here is one obſtacle in our way; a bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear which terrifies us, diſcourages, and checks our ardour: we mean the painful cares of education, which demand, on our part, labour, aſſiduity, ſtudy, application, and a thouſand things which are repugnant and unpleaſant to youth. We muſt labour, you ſay, to be formed by a good education and virtue.</p>
            <p>You certainly muſt; I agree with you in that aſſertion; and I expreſsly declare to you, that labour is the duty impoſed on you, as the condition, without which you cannot derive any ſolid benefit from your education, were you poſſeſſed of the fineſt natural abilities, and the moſt eminent maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But permit me to aſk you, in my turn, what could you do or accompliſh in life without labour and application? Is not the whole courſe of human life, from the cradle to the grave, one continued ſcene of labour, cares, and fatigue?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:030594_0114_0FE7F5F5D5989080"/>
Let us conſider man in his infancy at the very period in which his ideas begin to dawn, his reaſon to expand. Does it not coſt him ſome pains to know the uſe he ſhould make of this reaſon. Wrapt in the deep gloom of ignorance, ſurrounded on every ſide by objects he is unacquainted with, does it not coſt him infinite trouble to learn the name of each, its uſe, connection, convenience, and properties? All nature is aſtoniſhing and myſterious to his view. He is to himſelf an impenetrable enigma. He has only language to enquire, and to aſk queſtions. The ſenſes, thoſe admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vehicles of information, diſcover and manifeſt themſelves to him but at his own expence, and by the dint of repeated diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and painful experiments. Arrived at the ſeaſon of youth, is it not irkſome to him to acquire that profeſſion which he made his choice? Is he not obliged to devote a part of his time to ſtudy at thoſe ſchools which have been appointed him? Muſt he obey them in every thing, and give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up diligently to all the exerciſes and
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030594_0115_0FE7F5FC8E1AD700"/>different kinds of ſtudy which they preſcribe and aſſign him? If he refuſes to liſten to them, if he ſhews himſelf an enemy to labour, can he ever advance or make any progreſs in the knowledge of their art? Is it not by conſtant imitation, by long and painful efforts, by daily aſſiduity, that he ceaſes to be a ſcholar, and commences a maſter? In a riper age, if he wiſhes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive any advantage from the employment he follows, to exerciſe it with honour, and merit eſteem and confidence, ſhould he not perſevere and double his labours; give proofs of his talents, capacity, emulation, patience, fidelity, and probity; and ſurmount every difficulty annexed to his ſituation? If he is ſettled in life; if he is married; if he has a family; what new cares and endleſs trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles is he involved in? To pay the ſame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to his children, which he himſelf has experienced from his parents; to feed them in their infancy; to protect them from a thouſand dangers which encompaſs and threaten them; to be attentive to all their neceſſaries; to procure them education;
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:030594_0116_0FE7F5FE2254E120"/>and to ſettle them in the world; all theſe are but a part of the duties which he has to perform on their account.</p>
            <p>You are now going to mention what prevents you from following the practice of virtue, and attending to the care of your edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; becauſe it is too painful and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome a purſuit. It is, you ſay, too laborious to acquire education? But do you not know, that ſuch is the order of Providence in the diſpenſation of all his gifts, that he does not grant us any of them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a portion of labour from us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn? The very bread we eat, obſerve what a tedious proceſs it muſt go through, to bring it to the ſtate in which it becomes our food? Have you conſidered, that it is the fruit of the toils, the watchings, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and ſweat of the labourer? Have you reflected on the changes and alterations it has undergone? This gold, this ſilver, which mankind in general are ſo enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, do you know rightly what it is? Have you pondered on it? Do you know that we muſt enter the very bowels of the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:030594_0117_0FE7F604AD387638"/>earth, and pierce into its deep and gloomy receſſes, to ſeek it? That thouſands of our fellow-beings are deprived of the light of day, and in a manner buried alive, in the very womb of the earth, there to procure theſe metals, for which our exceſſive thirſt parches and conſumes us? Thoſe delicate diſhes, thoſe choice viands, which ſometimes crown the feſtive board, do you know, that to obtain them, we muſt traverſe the ſeas to remote diſtances, in the midſt of rocks and dangers the moſt imminent? Thoſe ſilks with which we are ſo fond of clothing and adorning our perſons, are they not the ſpoil of worms, the moſt contemptible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects?</p>
            <p>I ſhould exceed the limits of theſe pages, were I to analyſe all the wants of man, and the pains it coſts him to ſatisfy them. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is the condition and appendage of our nature; and without this condition, you could not obtain any enjoyment. If you wiſh to have friends, you muſt be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in their welfare, love them, and render them ſervice. If you mean to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030594_0118_0FE7F6064514CFD0"/>yourſelf in the city you reſide in, you muſt become uſeful to your fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. If you have an ambition to excel in your profeſſion, you muſt give proofs of capacity, talents, and merit. If you are deſirous that the earth produce fruits, you muſt cultivate it. If you propoſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich yourſelf by commerce, you muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your buſineſs, be attentive, active, and perſevering. In ſhort, any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion you embrace, you cannot practice without trouble, toil, and difficulty. Would you ſuppoſe, then, that virtue is the only good on earth to be acquired without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions? Virtue, which is the moſt precious of all gifts, and infinitely ſurpaſſes all other things? Could you then henceforth love it as much as it is amiable, by making it the object of your addreſſes, the end of your education, and your whole conduct!</p>
            <p>Plutarch, in the portrait he draws of the true philoſopher, repreſents him practiſing virtue for its own ſake; and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of his reaſon, placing it above the poſſeſſion of all other advantages; ſhewing
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030594_0119_0FE7E927274636E8"/>his firm attachment to its principles, even in the ſuppoſition that he had lived in a country without prince or magiſtrate to watch over the actions of men, or without laws to direct their conduct, and teach them to be juſt, moderate, good, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. Would to God that this picture were realized in you! That you would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no other philoſophy than that of a man truly religious, and truly virtuous! You would then, by practiſing the works of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, enjoy that happineſs and thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings which are its fruit and its reward.</p>
