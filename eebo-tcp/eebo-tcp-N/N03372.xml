            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A brief Narrative of the Caſe and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of <hi>John Peter Zenger,</hi> Printer of the <hi>New-York weekly Journal.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS There was but one Printer in the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> that printed a publick News Paper, I was in Hopes, if I undertook to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh another, I might make it worth my while; and I ſoon found my Hopes were not groundleſs: My firſt Paper was printed, <hi>Nov.</hi> 5<hi>th,</hi> 1733. and I continued printing and publiſhing of them, I thought to the Satisfaction of every Body, till the <hi>January</hi> following; when the Chief Juſtice was pleaſed to animadvert upon the Doctrine of Libels, in a long Charge given in that Term to the Grand Jury, and afterwards on the third <hi>Tueſday</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> 1734. was again pleaſed to charge the Grand Jury in the following Words.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen</hi>; I ſhall conclude with reading a Paragraph or two out of the ſame Book, concerning Libels; they are arrived to that Height, that they call loudly for your Animadverſion; it is high Time to put a Stop to them; for at the rate Things are now carried on, when all Order and Government is endeavoured to be trampled on; Reflections are caſt upon Perſons of all Degrees, muſt not theſe Things end in Sedition, if not timely prevented? Lenity, you have ſeen will not avail, it becomes you then to enquire after the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, that we may in a due Courſe of Law be enabled to puniſh them. If you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> do not interpoſe, conſider whether the ill Conſequences that may ariſe from any Diſturbances of the publick Peace, may not in part, lye at your Door?</p>
               <p>Hawkins, <hi>in his Chapter of Libels, conſiders three Points, 1</hi>st. What ſhall be ſaid to be a Libel. <hi>2</hi>dly. Who are lyable to be puniſhed for it. <hi>3</hi>dly. In what Manner they are to be puniſhed. <hi>Under the 1</hi>st. <hi>he ſays, §. 7.</hi> Nor can there be any Doubt, but that a Writing which defames a private Perſon only, is as much a Libel as that which defames Perſons intruſted in a publick Capacity, in as much as it manifeſtly tends to create ill Blood, and to cauſe a Diſturbance of the publick Pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>; however, it is certain, that it is a very high Aggravation of a Libel, that it tends to ſcandalize the Government, by reflecting on thoſe who are entruſted with the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of publick Affairs, which does not only endanger the publick Peace, as all other Libels do, by ſtirring up the Parties immediately concerned in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to Acts of Revenge, but alſo has a direct Tendency to breed in the People a Diſlike of their Governours, and incline them to Faction and Sedition. <hi>As to the 2</hi>d. <hi>Point he ſays §. 10.</hi> It is certain, not only he who compoſes or procures another to compoſe it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo that he who publiſhes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or procures another to publiſh it are in Danger of being puniſhed for it; and it is ſaid not to be material whether he who d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

eaſy than to publiſh the moſt virulent Papers with the greateſt Security if the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Purport of them from an illiterate Publiſher, would make him ſafe in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing them: Alſo, it has been ſaid, that if he who hath either read a Libel himſelf, or hath heard it read by another, do afterwards maliciouſly read or report any Part of it in the Preſence of others, or lend or ſhew it to another, he is guilty of an unlawful Publication of it. Alſo, it hath been holden, that the Copying of a Libel ſhall be a concluſive Evidence of the Publication of it, unleſs the Party can prove, that he delivered it to a Magiſtrate to examine it, in which Caſe the Act <hi>ſubſequent</hi> is ſaid to explain the Intention <hi>precedent.</hi> But it ſeems to be the better Opinion, that he who firſt writes a Libel, dictated by another, is thereby guilty of Making of it, and conſequently puniſhable for the bare Writing; for it was no Libel till it was reduced to Writing.</p>
               <p>Theſe, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> are ſome of the Offences which are to make Part of your Enquiries; and if any other ſhould ariſe in the Courſe of your Proceedings, in which you are at a Loſs, or conceive any Doubts, upon your Application here, We will aſſiſt and direct you.</p>

            <p>Upon reading of which ORDER, the Court forbad the Entring thereof in their Books at that Time, and many of them declared, that if it ſhould be entred, they would have their Proteſt entered againſt it.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 6<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the Sherriff of <hi>New-York</hi> moved the Court of <hi>Quarter Seſſions,</hi> to comply with the ſaid Order, upon which one of the Aldermen offered a proteſt, which was read by the Clerk, and approved of by all the Aldermen, either expreſsly or by not objecting to it, and is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

Wherefore this Court conceives it ſelf bound in Duty (for the Preſervation of the Rights of this Corporation, and as much as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

and to forbid all the Members of this Corporation, to pay any Obedience to it,</hi> until it be ſhewn to this Court, that the ſame is Authorized by ſome known Law, which they neither know nor believe that it is.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Upon reading of which, it was required of the Honourable <hi>Francis Hariſon,</hi> Recorder of this Corporation, and one of the Members of the Council, (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at making ſaid Order) to ſhew by what Law or Authority the ſaid OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DER was made; upon which he ſpoke in Support of it, and cited the Caſe of Doctor <hi>Sacheverel</hi>'s Sermon, which was by the Houſe of Lords ordered to be burnt by the Hands of the Hangman, and that the Mayor and Aldermen of <hi>London</hi> ſhould attend the doing of it, To which one of the Aldermen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to this Purpoſe; That he conceived the Caſe was no ways parallel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Doctor <hi>Sacheverel,</hi> and his Sermon, were impeached by the Houſe of Commons of <hi>England,</hi> which is the Grand Jury of the Nation, and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of the whole People of <hi>England</hi>: That this their Impeachment they proſecuted before the Houſe of Lords, the greateſt Court of Juſtice of <hi>Britain</hi> and which beyond Memory of Man, has had Cognizance of Things of that Nature, that there <hi>Sacheverel</hi> had a fair Hearing in Defence of himſelf and of his Sermon. And after that fair Hearing, he and his Sermon were juſtly, fairly and legally condemened; that he had read the Caſe of Dr. <hi>Sacheverel,</hi> &amp; thought he could charge his Memory, that the Judgment of the Houſe of Lords in that Caſe was, That the Mayor and Sheriffs of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> only ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Burning of the Sermon, and not the Aldermen; and farther he remembred, that the Order upon that Judgment, was only directed to the Sheriffs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and not even to the Mayor, who did not attend the doing it; and farther ſaid, that would Mr. Recorder ſhow, that the Governour and Council had ſuch Authority as the Houſe of Lords, and that the Papers ordered to be burnt were in like manner legally proſecuted and condemned, there the Caſe of Doctor <hi>Sacheverel</hi> might be to the Purpoſe; but without ſhewing that, it rather proved that a Cenſure ought not to be pronounced, till a fair Tryal by a Competent and legal Authority were firſt had. Mr. Recorder was deſired to produce the Books from whence he cited his Authorities, that the Court might judge of them themſelves, and was told, that if he could produce ſufficient Authorities to warrant <hi>this ORDER,</hi> they would readily obey it, but otherwiſe not. Upon which he ſaid, he did not carry his Books about with him. To which it was anſwered, he might ſend for them, or order a Conſtable to fetch them. Upon which he aroſe, and at the lower End of the Table he mentioned, That Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Paſtoral Letter, was ordered by the Houſe of Lords, to be burnt by the High Bailiff of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>; upon which he abruptly went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, without waiting for an Anſwer or promiſing to bring his Books, and did not return ſitting the Court.</p>
            <p>After Mr. Recorder's Departure, it was moved that the <hi>Proteſt</hi> ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; to which it was anſwered, That the <hi>Proteſt</hi> could not be entered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entering alſo the ORDER, and it was not fit to take any Notice of IT, and therefore it was propoſed that no Notice ſhould be taken in their Books of either, which was unanimouſly agreed to by the Court.</p>
            <p>The Sherriff then moved, that the Court would direct their Whipper to perform the ſaid ORDER; to which it was anſwered, That as he was the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer of the Corporation, they would give no ſuch <hi>Order.</hi> Soon after which the Court adjourned, and did not attend the Burning of the Papers. Afterwards about Noon, the Sheriff after reading the Numbers of the ſeveral Papers which were ordered to be burnt, delivered them unto the Hands of his own Negroe, and ordered him to put them into the Fire, which he did, at which

            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 23<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> the ſaid Exceptions came to be argued, by <hi>James Alexander</hi> and <hi>William Smith,</hi> of Council for me, and by Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney General and Mr. <hi>Warrrel,</hi> of Council againſt me, in Preſence of ſome Hundreds of the Inhabitants; where my Council (ſaving the Benefit of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the illegality of the Warrant) inſiſted that I might be admitted to reaſonable Bail. And to ſhew that it was my Right to be ſo, they offered <hi>Magna Charta, The Petition of Right,</hi> 3 Car. <hi>The</hi> Habeas Corpus <hi>Act of</hi> 31 Car. 2. which directs the Sum in which Bail is to be taken, to be,
<q>according to the Quality of the Priſoner, and Nature of the Offence.</q>
Alſo 2<hi>d Hawkins,</hi> Cap. 15 §. 5. in theſe Words,
<q>But Juſtices muſt take Care, that under Pretence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding ſufficient Security, they do not make ſo exceſſive a Demand, as in Effect amounts to a Denyal of Bail; for this is lookt on as a great Grievance, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of as ſuch, by <hi>1 W.</hi> &amp; <hi>M. Seſs. 2d.</hi> by which it is declared, <hi>That ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Bail ought not to be required.</hi>
               </q>
It was alſo ſhewn, that the ſeven Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who in King <hi>James</hi> the II<hi>d's</hi> Time, were charged with the like Crime that I ſtood charged with, were admitted to Bail on their own Recognizances, the Arch-Biſhop in 200 <hi>l.</hi> &amp; each of the other ſix in a 100 <hi>l.</hi> apiece only. Sundry other Authorities and Arguments were produced and inſiſted on by my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, to prove my Right to be admitted to moderate Bail, and to ſuch Bail as was in my Power to give; and ſundry Parts of Hiſtory they produced, to ſhew how much the requiring exceſſive Bail had been reſented by Parliament.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004107_0007_1003C516CC833B58"/>
And in order to Enable the Court to judge what Surety was in my Power to Give, I made Affidavit, <hi>That (my Debts paid) I was not worth Forty Pounds, (the Tools of my Trade and wearing Apparel excepted.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some warm Expreſſions (to ſay no worſe of them) were dropt on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſufficiently known and reſented by the Auditory, which for my Part I deſire may be buried in Oblivion: Upon the whole it was <hi>Ordered that I might be admitted to Bail, my ſelf in</hi> 400. l. <hi>with two Sureties, each in</hi> 200 l. <hi>and that I ſhould be remanded till I Gave it.</hi> And as this was Ten Times more, than was in my Power to counter-ſecure any Perſon in giving Bail for me, I conceived I could not aſk any to become my Bail on theſe Terms; and therefore I returned to Goal, where I lay until <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 28<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> 1734,5, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt Day of that Term; and the Grand Jury having found nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, I Expected to have been diſcharged from my Impriſonment: But my Hopes proved vain; for the Attorney General then charged me by <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> for Printing and publiſhing Parts, of my Journals No. 13. and 23. as being <hi>falſe, ſcandalous, malicious, and ſeditious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Information my Council appeared, and offered Exceptions, leaving a Blank for inſerting the Judges Commiſſions, which the Court were of opinion not to receive till thoſe Blanks were filled up. In the ſucceeding Vacation the Judges gave Copies of their Commiſſions; and on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 15<hi>th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> laſt, the firſt Day of the ſucceeding Term, my Council offered theſe Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which were as follows.</p>

               <p>After the Order of the Court was read, Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> aſked whether it was the Order of Mr. Juſtice <hi>Philipſe</hi> as well as of the Chief Juſtice? To which both anſwered, that it was their Order; upon which Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> added, That it was proper to aſk that Queſtion, <hi>That they might know how to have their Relief:</hi> He farther obſerved to the Court, upon reading of the Order, That they were miſtaken in their Wording of it, becauſe the Exceptions were <hi>only to their Commiſſions,</hi> and <hi>not to the being of the Court,</hi> as is therein alledged; and prayed that the Order might be altered accordingly. The Chief Juſtice ſaid, they conceived the Exceptions were againſt the Being of the Court. Both Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> denyed that they were, and prayed the Chief Juſtice to point to the Place that contained ſuch Exception; and further added; That the Court might well exiſt, tho' the Commiſſions of all the Judges were void; which the Chief Juſtice confeſſed to be true: And therefore they prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that the Order in that Point might be altered; but it was denied.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> deſired to know, whether they <hi>over raded</hi> or <hi>rejected</hi> the Exceptions; the Chief Juſtice ſaid, he did not underſtand the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; to which ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> replied, that if he <hi>rejected</hi> the Exceptions, then they could not appear upon the Proceedings, and in that Caſe the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant was entitled to have them made Part of the Proceedings, by Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: But if they <hi>over ruled</hi> them, then by ſo doing, they only declared them not ſufficient, to hinder them from proceeding by virtue of thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, and the Exceptions would remain as Records of the Court, and ought to be entered on the Record of the Cauſe as Part of the Proceedings. The Chief Juſtice ſaid, they muſt remain upon the File, to warrant what we have done; as to being Part of the Record of the Proceedings in that Cauſe, he ſaid, you may ſpeak to that Point to morrow.</p>

the <hi>Rejecting</hi> or <hi>Over ruling</hi> of <hi>Zenger</hi>'s Exceptions on the Morrow: To which the Chief Juſtice anſwered, That he ſaid. <hi>You may get ſome Perſon to ſpeak to that Point on the Morrow, not meaning that the ſaid</hi> Alexander <hi>ſhould ſpeak to it, that being contrary to the Order,</hi> Both Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſaid, they underſtood it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>They both alſo mentioned, that it was a Doubt, whether by the Words of the Order they were debarred of their Practice as Council, as well as Attornies, whereas they practiſed in both Capacities? To which the Chief Juſtice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That the Order was plain. <hi>That</hi> James Alexander, <hi>
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and</hi> William Smith, <hi>were debarred and excluded from their whole Practice at this Barr, and that the Order was intended to barr their acting both as Council and as Attornies, and that it could not be conſtrued otherwiſe,</hi> And it being aſked Mr. <hi>Philipſe,</hi> Whether he underſtood the Order ſo; He anſwered, that he did.</p>
               <p>Upon this Excluſion of my Council I petitioned the Court to order Council for my Defence, who thereon oppointed <hi>John Chambers,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who pleaded <hi>Not Guilty</hi> for me to the Information. But as to the Point. <hi>Whether my Exceptions ſhould be part of the Record as was moved by my former Council,</hi> Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> thought not proper to ſpeak to it; Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> alſo moved, that a certain Day in the next Term, might be appointed for my Tryal, and for <hi>a Struck Jury</hi>; whereupon my Tryal was ordered to be on <hi>Munday</hi> the 4<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and the Court would conſider till the firſt Day of next Term, whether I ſhould have a Struck Jury or not, and ordered that the Sheriff ſhould in the mean Time, at my Charge, return the Freeholders Book.</p>

                  <hi>Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> has not been pleaſed to favour me with his Notes, ſo I cannot, for Fear of doing him Injuſtice, pretend to ſet down his Argument; But here Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> ſet forth very clearly the Nature of a Libel, the great Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances that ought to be made for what Men ſpeak or write, That in all Libels there muſt be ſome particular Perſons ſo clearly pointed out, that no Doubt muſt remain about who is meant; That he was in hopes <hi>Mr. Attorney</hi> would fall in his Proof, as to this Point; and therefore deſired that he would go on to examine his Witneſſes.</hi>

                  <p>May it pleaſe your Honour; I am concerned in this Cauſe on the Part of Mr. <hi>Zenger</hi> the Defendant. The Information againſt my Client was ſent me, a few Days before I left Home, with ſome Inſtructions to let me know how far I might rely upon the Truth of thoſe Parts of the Papers ſet forth in the Information, and which are ſaid to be libellous. And tho' I am perfectly of the Opinion with the Gentleman who has juſt now ſpoke, on the ſame Side with me, as to the common Courſe of Proceedings, I mean in putting Mr. Attorney upon proving, that my Client printed and publiſhed thoſe Papers mentioned in the Information; yet I cannot think it proper for me (without doing Violence to my own Principles) to deny the Publication of a Complaint, which I think is the Right of every free-born Subject to make, when the Matters ſo publiſhed can be ſupported with Truth; and therefore I'll ſave Mr. Attorney the Trouble of Examining his Witneſſes to that Point; and I do (for my Client) confeſs, that he both printed and publiſhed the two News Papers ſet forth in the Information, and I hope in ſo doing he has committed no Crime.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Attorney.</speaker>
                  <p>Then if Your Honour pleaſes, ſince Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the Fact, I think our Witneſſes may be diſcharged; we have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Occaſion for them.</p>

                  <p>Indeed Sir, as Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> has confeſſed the Printing and Publiſhing theſe Libels, I think the Jury muſt find a Verdict for the King; for ſuppoſing they were true, the Law ſays that they are not the leſs libellous for that; nay indeed the Law ſays, their being true is an Aggravation of the Crime.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>Not ſo neither, Mr. Attorney, there are two Words to that Bargain. I hope it is not our bare Printing and Publiſhing a Paper, that will make it a Libel: You will have ſomething more to do, before you make my Client a Libeller; for the Words themſelves muſt be libellous, that is, <hi>falſe, ſcandalous, and ſeditious</hi> or elſe we are not guilty.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>As Mr. Attorney has not been pleaſed to favour us with his Argument, which he read, or with the Notes of it, we cannot take upon us to ſet down his Words, but only to ſhew the Book Caſes he cited, and the general Scope of his Argument, which he drew from thoſe Authorities. He obſerved upon the Excellency, as well as Uſe of Government, and the great Regard and Reverence, which had been conſtantly paid to it, both under the Law and the Goſpel. That by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment we were protected in our Lives, Religion and Properties; and that for theſe Reaſons, great Care had always been taken to prevent every Thing that might tend to ſcandalize Magiſtrates, and others concerned in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Government, eſpecially the ſupream Magiſtrate. And that there were many Inſtances of very ſevere Judgments, and of Puniſhments inflicted upon ſuch, as had attempted to bring the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into Contempt; by publiſhing falſe and ſcurrilous Libels againſt it, or by ſpeaking evil and ſcandalous Words of Men in Authority; to the great Diſturbance of the publick Peace. And to ſupport this, he cited <hi>5 Coke 121. (ſuppoſe it ſhould be 125.) Wood's Inſtit. 430. 2 Lilly 168. 1 Hawkins 73.11.6.</hi> From theſe Books he inſiſted, that a Libel was a malicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation of any Perſon, expreſſed either in Printing or Writing, Signs or Pictures, to aſperſe the Reputation of one that is alive, or the Memory of one that it dead; if he is a private Man, the Libeller deſerves a ſevere Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but if it is againſt a Magiſtrate or other publick Perſon, it it a greater Offence; for this concerns not only the Breach of the Peace, but the Scandal of the Government; for what greater Scandal of Government can there be, than to have corrupt or wicked Magiſtrates to be appointed by the King, to govern his Subjects under him? And a greater Imputation to the State cannot be, than to ſuffer ſuch corrupt Men to ſit in the ſacred Seat of Juſtice, or to have any Medling in, or concerning the Adminiſtration of Juſtice: And from the ſame Books Mr. Attorney inſiſted, that whether the Perſon defamed is a private Man or a Magiſtrate, whether living or Dead, whether the Libel is true or falſe, or if the Party againſt whom it is made is of good or evil Fame, it is nevertheleſs a Libel: For in a ſettled State of Government, the Party grieved ought to complain for every Injury done him, in the ordinary Courſe of the Law. And as to its Publication, the Law had taken ſo great Care of Men's Reputations, that if one maliciouſly repeats it, or ſings it in the Preſence of an other, or delivers the Libel or a Copy of it over, to ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the Party, he is to be puniſhed as a Publiſher of a Libel. He ſaid it was likewiſe evident, that Libelling was an Offence againſt the Law of God. Act. XXIII. <hi>5. Then ſaid</hi> Paul, <hi>I wiſt not Brethren, that he was the High Prieſt: For it is written, thou ſhalt not ſpeak evil of the Ruler of the People. 2</hi> Pet. X. <hi>11. Deſpiſe Government, preſumptuous are they, ſelf willed, they are not afraid to ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> &amp;c. He then inſiſted that it was clear, both by the Law of God and Man, That it was a very great Offence to ſpeak evil of, or to revile thoſe in Authority over us; and that Mr. <hi>Zenger</hi> had offended in a moſt notorious and groſs Manner, in ſcandalizing His Excellency our Governour, who is the King's immediate Repreſentative, and the ſupream Magiſtrate of this Province: For can there be any Thing more ſcandalous ſaid of a Governour than what is publiſhed in thoſe Papers? Nay,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004107_0017_1003A5435A85E6D8"/>
not only the Governour, but both the Council and Aſſembly are ſcandalizen, for there it is plainly ſaid, That <hi>as Matters now ſtand, their Liberties and Properties are precarious, and that Slavery is like to be entailed on them and their Poſterity.</hi> And then again Mr. <hi>Zenger</hi> ſays, <hi>The Aſſembly ought to diſpiſe the Smiles or Frowns of a Governour; That he thinks the Law is at an End; That we ſee Mens Deeds deſtroyed, Judges arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily diſplaced, new Courts erected, without Conſent of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> And <hi>That it ſeems Tryals by Juries are taken away when a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour pleaſes; That none can call any Thing their own, longer than thoſe in the Adminiſtration will condeſcend to let them do it.</hi> — And Mr. Attorney added, that he did not know what could be ſaid in Defence of a Man, that had ſo notoriouſly ſcandalized the Governour and principal Magiſtrates and Officers of the Governments, by charging them with depriving the People of their Rights and Liberties, and taking away Tryals by Juries, and in ſhort, putting an End to the Law it ſelf. — If this was not a Libel, he ſaid, he did not know what was one. Such Perſons as will take thoſe Liberties with Governours and Magiſtrates, he thought ought to ſuffer for ſtirring up Sedition and Diſcontent among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And concluded by ſaying, that the Government had been very much tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and expoſed by Mr. <hi>Zenger,</hi> before he was taken Notice of; that at laſt it was the Opinion of the Governour and Council, that he ought not to be ſuffered to go on, to diſturb the Peace of the Government; by publiſhing ſuch Libels againſt the Governour, and the chief Perſons in the Government; And therefore they had directed this Proſecution, to put a Stop to this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and wicked Practice, of libelling and defaming His Majeſty's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſturbing his Majeſty's Peace.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Mr. <hi>Chambers</hi> then ſum'd up to the Jury, obſerving with great Strength of Reaſon on Mr. Attorney's Defect of Proof, that the Papers in the Information were <hi>Falſe, Malicious or Seditious,</hi> which was incumbent on him to prove to the Jury, and without which they could not on their Oaths ſay, <hi>That they were ſo, as charged.</hi>

                  <p>May it pleaſe Your Honour; I agree with Mr. Attorney, that Government is a ſacred Thing, but I differ very widely from him when he would inſinuate, that the juſt Complaints of a Number of Men, who ſuffer under a bad Adminiſtration, is libelling that Adminiſtration. Had I believed that to be Law, I ſhould not have given the Court the Trouble of hearing any Thing that I could ſay in this Cauſe. I own, when I read the Information, I had not the Art to find our (without the Help of Mr. Attorney's <hi>Innuendo's</hi>) that the Governor was the Perſon meant in every Period of that News Paper; and I was inclined to believe, that they were wrote by ſome, who from an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Zeal for Liberty, had miſconſtrued the Conduct of ſome Perſons in Authority into Crimes; and that Mr. Attorney out of his too great Zeal for Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, had exhibited this Information, to correct the Indiſcretion of my Client; and at the ſame Time, to ſhew his Superiors the great Concern he had, leſt they ſhould be treated with any undue Freedom. But from what Mr. Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney has juſt now ſaid, <hi>to wit,</hi> That this Proſecution was directed by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Council, and from the Extraordinary Appearance of People of all Conditions which I obſerve in Court upon this Occaſion, I have Reaſon to think, that thoſe in the Adminiſtration have by this Proſecution ſomething more in View, and that the People believe they have a good deal more at ſtake, than I apprehended: And therefore, as it is become my Duty, to be
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004107_0018_1003C5348C493F98"/>
both plain and particular in this Cauſe, I beg Leave to beſpeak the Patience of the Court.</p>
                  <p>I was in hopes, as that terrible Court, where thoſe dreadful Judgments were given, and that Law eſtabliſhed, which Mr. Attorney has produced for Authorities to ſupport this Cauſe, was long ago laid aſide, as the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Court to the Liberties of the People of <hi>England</hi> that ever was known in that Kingdom; that Mr. Attorney knowing this, would not have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet up a Star-Chamber here, nor to make their Judgments a Precedent to us: For it is well known, that what would have been judg'd Treaſon in thoſe Days for a Man to ſpeak, I think, has ſince not only been practiced as lawful, but the contrary Doctrine has been held to be Law.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Brewſter's</hi> Caſe, for Printing, <hi>That the Subjects might defend their Rights and Liberties by Arms, in caſe the King ſhould go about to deſtroy them,</hi> he was told by the Chief Juſtice that it was a great Mercy, he was not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Sacheverell</hi> was ſentenced in the higheſt Court in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> for ſaving, <hi>That ſuch a Reſiſtance was not lawful.</hi> Beſides, as Times have made very great Changes in the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> ſo in my Opinion there is good Reaſon that Places ſhould do ſo too.</p>
                  <p>Is it not ſurprizing to ſee a Subject, upon his receiving a Commiſſion from the King to be a Governor of a Colony in <hi>America,</hi> immediately imagining himſelf to be veſted with all the Prerogatives belonging to the ſacred Perſon of his Prince? And which is yet more aſtoniſhing, to ſee that a People can be ſo wild as to allow of and acknowledge thoſe Prerogatives and Exemptions, even to their own Deſtruction? Is it ſo hard a Matter to diſtinguiſh between the Majeſty of our Sovereign, and the Power of a Governor of the Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Is not this making very free with our Prince, to apply that Regard, Obedience and Allegiance to a Subject which is due only to Our Sovereign? And yet in all the Caſes which Mr. Attorney has cited, to ſhew the Duty and Obedience we owe to the Supreme Magiſtrate, it is the King that is there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ean and underſtood, tho' Mr. Attorney is pleaſed to urge them as Authorities to prove the Heinouſneſs of Mr. <hi>Zenger's</hi> Offence againſt the Governor of <hi>New-York.</hi> The ſeveral Plantations are compared to ſo many large Corporations, and perhaps not improperly; and can any one give an Inſtance, that the Mayor or H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d of a Corporation, ever put in a Claim to the ſacred Rights of Majeſty? Let us not (while we are pretending to pay a great Regard to our Prince and His Peace) make bold to transfer that Allegiance to a Subject, which we owe to our King only. What ſtrange Doctrine is it, to preſs every Thing for Law here which is ſo in <hi>England?</hi> I Believe we ſhould not think it a Favour, at preſent at leaſt, to eſtabliſh this Practice. In <hi>England</hi> ſo great a Regard and Reverence is had to the Judges, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>c.</hi> 3 <hi>Inſt.</hi> 140.</note> that if any Man ſtrikes another in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall,</hi> while the Judges are ſitting, he ſhall loſe his Right Hand, and forfeit his Land and Goods, for ſo doing. And tho' the Judges here claim all the Powers and Authorities within this Government, that a Court of King's Bench has in <hi>England,</hi> yet I believe Mr. Attorney will ſcarcely ſay, that ſuch a Puniſhment could be legally inflicted on a Man for committing ſuch an Offence, in the Preſence of the Judges ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in any Court within the Province of <hi>New-York.</hi> The Reaſon is obvious; a Quarrel or Riot in <hi>New-York</hi> cannot poſſibly be attended with thoſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequences that it might in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi>; nor (I hope) will it be alledged, that any Miſbehaviour to a Governor in the Plantations will, or
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004107_0019_1003C5368C5EE690"/>
ought to be, judged of or puniſhed, as a like Undutifulneſs would be, to Our Sovereign. From all which, I hope Mr. Atttorney will not think it proper to apply his Law-Caſes (to ſupport the Cauſe of his Governor) which have only been judged, where the King's Safety or Honour was concerned. It will not be denied but that a Freeholder in the Province of <hi>New-York</hi> has as good a Right to the ſole and ſeparate Uſe of his Lands, as a Freeholder in <hi>England,</hi> who has a Right to bring an Action of Treſpaſs againſt his Neighbour, for ſuffering his Horſe or Cow to come and feed upon his Land, or eat his Corn, whether incloſed or not incluſed; and yet I believe it would be looked upon as a ſtrange Attempt, for one Man here, to bring an Action againſt another, whoſe Cattle and Horſes feed upon his Grounds not incloſed, or indeed for eating and treading down his Corn, if that were not incloſed. Numberleſs are the Inſtances of this Kind that might be given, to ſhew, that what is good Law at one Time and in one Place, is not ſo at another Time and in another Place; ſo that I think, the Law ſeems to expect, that in theſe Parts of the World Men ſhould take Care, by a good Fence, to preſerve their Property, from the Injury of unruly Beaſts. And perhaps there may be as good Reaſon why Men ſhould take the ſame Care, to make an honeſt and upright Conduct a Fence and Security againſt the Injury of unruly Tongues.</p>

                  <p>I don't know what the Gentleman means, by comparing Caſes of Freeholders in <hi>England</hi> with Freeholders here. What has this Caſe to do with Actions of Treſpaſs, or Men's Fencing their Ground? The Caſe before the Court is, whether Mr. <hi>Zenger</hi> is guilty of Libelling His Excellency the Governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> and indeed the whole Adminiſtration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> has confeſſed the Printing and Publiſhing, and I think nothing is plainer, than that the Words in the Information are <hi>ſcandal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and tend to ſedition, and to diſquiet the Minds of the People of this Province.</hi> And if ſuch Papers are not Libels, I think it may be ſaid, there can be no ſuch Thing as a Libel.</p>

                  <p>May it pleaſe Your Honour; I cannot agree with Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney: For tho' I freely acknowledge, that there are ſuch Things as Libels, yet I muſt inſiſt at the ſame Time, that what my Client is charged with, is not a Libel; and I obſerved juſt now, that Mr. Attorney in defining a Libel, made uſe of the Words, <hi>ſcandalous, ſeditious, and tend to diſquiet the People</hi>; but (whether with Deſign or not I will not ſay) he omitted the Word <hi>falſe.</hi>

                  <p>I think I did not omit the Word <hi>falſe:</hi> But it has been ſaid already, that it may be a Libel, notwithſtanding it may be true.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Hamilton.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>In this I muſt ſtill differ with Mr. Attorney; for I depend upon it, we are to be tried upon this Information now before the Court and Jury, and to which we have pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and by it we are charged with Printing and publiſhing <hi>a certain falſe, malicious, ſeditious and ſcandalous Libel.</hi> This Word <hi>falſe</hi> muſt have ſome Meaning, or elſe how came it there? I hope Mr. Attorney will not ſay, he put it there by Chance, and I am of Opinion his Information would not be good without it. But to ſhew that it is the principal Thing which, in my Opinion, makes a Libel, I put the Caſe, the Information had been for printing and publiſhing a certain <hi>true</hi> Libel, would that be the ſame Thing? Or could Mr. Attorney ſupport ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation by any Precedent in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Law? No, the Falſhood makes the Scandal, and both make the Libel. And to ſhew the Court that I am in good Earneſt, and to ſave the Court's Time, and Mr. Attorney's Trouble, I will agree, that if he can prove the Facts charged upon us, to be <hi>falſe,</hi> I'll
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004107_0020_1003C53870CCFF08"/>
own them to be <hi>ſcandalous, ſeditious</hi> and <hi>a Libel.</hi> So the Work ſeeme now to be pretty much ſhortned, and Mr. Attorney has now only to prove the Words <hi>falſe,</hi> in order to make us Guilty.</p>

                  <p>We have nothing to prove; you have confeſſed the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Publiſhing; but if it was neceſſary (as I inſiſt it it is not) how can we prove a Negative? But I hope ſome Regard will be had to the Authorities that have been produced, and that ſuppoſing all the Words to be true, yet that will not help them, that Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt</hi> in his Charge to the Jury, in the Caſe of <hi>Tutchin,</hi> made no Diſtinction, whether <hi>Tutchin</hi>'s Papers were <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe</hi>; and as Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt</hi> has made no Diſtinction in that Caſe, ſo none ought to be made here; nor can it be ſhewn in all that Caſe, there was any Queſtion made about their being <hi>falſe</hi> or <hi>true.</hi>

                  <p>I did expect to hear, That a Negative cannot be proved; but every Body knows there are many Exceptions to that general Rule: For if a Man is charged with killing another, or ſtealing his Neighbour's Horſe, if he is innocent in the one Caſe, he may prove the Man ſaid to be killed, to be really alive; and the Horſe ſaid to be ſtoln, never to have been out of his Maſter's Stable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this I think is proving a Negative. But we will ſave Mr. Attorney the Trouble of proving a Negative, and take the <hi>Onus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

And how ſhall it be known whether the Words are libelous, <hi>that is, true</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> but by admitting us to prove them <hi>true,</hi> ſince Mr. Attorney will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        </gap> provoking, and therefore the Offence is the greater, and conſequently the Judgment ſhould be the heavier.</hi> Well, ſuppoſe it were ſo, and let us agree for once, <hi>That Truth is a greater Sin than Falſhood:</hi> Yet as the Offences are not equal, and as the Puniſhment is arbitrary, <hi>that is,</hi> according as the Judges in their Diſcretion ſhall direct to be inflicted; is it not abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould know, whether the Libel is <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe,</hi> that they may by that Means be able to proportion the Puniſhment? For, would it not be a ſad Caſe, if the Judges, for want of a due Information, ſhould chance to give as ſevere a Judgment againſt a Man for writing or publiſhing a Lie, as for writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or publiſhing a Truth? And yet this (with ſubmiſſion) as monſtrous and ridiculous as it may ſeem to be, is the natural Conſequence of Mr. Attorney's Doctrine, <hi>That Truth makes a worſe Libel than Falſhood,</hi> and muſt follow from his not proving our Papers to be <hi>falſe,</hi> or not ſuffering us to prove them to be <hi>true.</hi> But this is only reaſoning upon the Caſe, and I will now proceed to ſhew, what in my Opinion will be ſufficient to induce the Court, to allow us to prove the Truth of the Words, which in the Information are called libellous. And firſt, I think there cannot be a greater Authority for us, than the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I juſt now mentioned, in the Caſe of <hi>John de Northampton,</hi> and that was in early Times, and before the Star Chamber came to its Fulneſs of Power and Wickedneſs. In that Judgment, as I obſerved, the <hi>Falſhood</hi> of the Letter which was wrote, is aſſigned as the very Ground of the Sentence. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to this it was urged by Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>State Tryals,</hi> Vol. 4.</note> in the Tryal of the Seven Biſhops, <hi>That the Falſity, the Malice, and Sedition of the Writing, were all Facts to be proved.</hi> But here it may be ſaid, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was one of the Biſhop's Council, and his Argument is not to be allowed for Law: But I offer it only to ſhew that we are not the firſt who have inſiſted, that to make a Writing a Libel, it muſt be <hi>falſe.</hi> And if the Argument of a Council muſt have no Weight, I hope there will be more Regard ſhewn to the Opinion of a Judge, and therefore I mention the Words of Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> in the ſame Tryal, where he ſays (of the Petition of the Biſhops, which was called a Libel, and upon which they were proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Information) That <hi>to make it a Libel, it muſt be falſe and malicious, and tend to Sedition</hi>; and declared, <hi>as he ſaw no Falſhood or Malice in it, he was of Opinion, that it was no Libel.</hi> Now I ſhould think this Opinion alone, in the Caſe of the King, and in a Caſe which that King had ſo much at Heart, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004107_0022_1003C53EE1BA9908"/>
which to this Day has never been contradicted, might be a ſufficent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to entitle us to the Liberty of proving the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Papers, which in the Information are called <hi>falſe, malicious, ſeditious and ſcandalous.</hi> If it be objected, <hi>that the Opinions of the other three Judges were againſt him.</hi> I anſwer, That the Cenſures the Judgments of theſe Men have undergone, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi>'s Opinion, his Judgment and Conduct upon that Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al has met with, and the Honour he gained to himſelf, for daring to ſpeak Truth at ſuch a Time, upon ſuch an Occaſion, and in the Reign of ſuch a King, is more than ſufficient, in my humble Opinion, to warrant our inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his Judgment, as a full Authority to our Purpoſe, and it will lye upon Mr. Attorney to ſhew, that this Opinion has ſince that Time been denied to be Law, or that Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> who delivered it, has ever been condemned or blamed for it, in any Law-Book extant at this Day, and this I will venture to ſay, Mr. Attorney cannot do. But to make this Point yet more clear, if any Thing can be clearer, I will on our Part proceed and ſhew, that in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton.</hi> His Council, notwithſtanding he ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one of the greateſt Monſters that ever preſided in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court (Judge <hi>Jefferies</hi>) inſiſted on the Want of Proof, to the <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>ſeditious Intent</hi> of the Author, of what was called a <hi>Libel.</hi> And in the Caſe of <hi>Tutchin,</hi> which ſeems to be Mr. Attorney's chief Authority, that Caſe is againſt him; for he was upon his Tryal put upon ſhewing the Truth of his Papers, but did not, at leaſt the Priſoner was aſked,<note place="margin">

                  <p>I thank Your Honour. Then Gentlemen of the Jury, it is to you we muſt now appeal, for Witneſſes, to the Truth of the Facts we have offered, and are denied the Liberty to prove; and let it not ſeem ſtrange, that I apply my ſelf to you in this Manner, I am warranted ſo to do both by Law and Reaſon. The Law ſuppoſes you to be ſummoned, <hi>out of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood where the Fact is alledged to be committed</hi>; and the Reaſon of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken out of the Neighbourhood is, <hi>becauſe you are ſuppoſed to have the beſt Knowledge of the Fact that is to be tried.</hi> And were you to find a Verdict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Client, you muſt take upon you to ſay, the Papers referred to in the Information, and which we acknowledge we printed and publiſhed, are <hi>falſe, ſcandalous and ſeditious</hi>; but of this I can have no Apprehenſion. You are Citizens of <hi>New-York</hi>; you are really what the Law ſuppoſes you to be, <hi>honeſt and lawful Men</hi>; and, according to my Brief, the Facts which we offer to prove were not committed in a Corner; they are notoriouſly known to be true; and therefore in your Juſtice lies our Safety. And as we are denied the Liberty of giving Evidence, to prove the Truth of what we have publiſhed, I will beg Leave to lay it down as a ſtanding Rule in ſuch Caſes, <hi>That the ſuppreſſing of Evidence ought always to be taken for the ſtrongeſt Evidence</hi>; and I hope it will have that Weight with you. But ſince we are not admitted to examine our Witneſſes, I will endeavour to ſhorten the Diſpute with Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, and to that End, I deſire he would favour us with ſome Standard De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition

                  <p>The Books, I think, have given a very full Definition of a Libel;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Hawk. Chap.</hi> LXXIII. §. 1. <hi>&amp; ſeq.</hi>

But it is ſaid, That in a larger Senſe the Notion of a Libel may be applied to any Defamation whatſoever, expreſſed either by Signs or Pictures, as by fixing up a Gallows againſt a Man's Door, or by painting him in a ſhameful and ignominious Manner. §.</hi> 3. <hi>And ſince the chief Cauſe for which the Law ſo ſeverely puniſhes all Offences of this Nature, is the direct Tendency of them to a Breach of Publick Peace, by provoking the Parties injured, their Friends and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

or Property of our Neighbour, it is unmanly and unmannerly to expoſe them either by Word or Writing. But when a Ruler of a People brings his perſonal Failings, but much more his Vices, into his Adminiſtration, and the People find themſelves affected by them, either in their Liberties or Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that will alter the Caſe mightily, and all the high Things that are ſaid in Favour of Rulers, and of Dignities, and upon the ſide of Power, will not be able to ſtop People's Mouths when they feel themſelves oppreſſed, I mean in a free Government. It is true in Times paſt it was a Crime to ſpeak Truth, and in that terrible Court of Star Chamber, many worthy and brave Men ſuffered for ſo doing; and yet even in that Court, and in thoſe bad Times, a great and good Man durſt ſay, what I hope will not be taken amiſs of me to ſay in this Place, <hi>to wit, The Practice of Informations for Libels is a Sword in the Hands of a wicked King, and an arrand Coward, to cut down and deſtroy the innocent; the one cannot; becauſe of his high Station, and the other dares not, becauſe of his Want of Courage, revenge himſelf in another Manner.</hi>

                  <p>Sure, Mr. Attorney, you won't make any Applications; all Men agree that we are governed by the beſt of Kings, and I cannot ſee the Meaning of Mr. Attorney's Caution; my well known Principles, and the Senſe I have of the Bleſſings we enjoy under His preſent Majeſty, makes it impoſſible for me to err, and I hope, even to be ſuſpected, in that Point of Duty to my King. May it pleaſe Your Honour, I was ſaying, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Duty and reverence claimed by Mr. Attorney to Men in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they are not exempt from obſerving the Rules of common Juſtice, either in their private or publick Capacities; the Laws of our Mother Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try know no Exemption. It is true, Men in Power are harder to be come at for Wrongs they do, either to a private Perſon, or to the publick; eſpecially a Governour in the Plantations, where they inſiſt upon an Exemption from anſwering Complaints of any Kind in their own Government. We are indeed told, and it is true they are obliged to anſwer a Suit in the King's Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> for a Wrong done to any Perſon here: But do we not know how impracticable this is to moſt Men among us, to leave their Families (who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their Labour and Care for their Livelihood) and carry Evidences to <hi>Britain,</hi> and at a great, nay, a far greater Expence than almoſt any of us are able to bear, only to proſecute a Governour for an Injury done here. But when the Oppreſſion is general there is no Remedy even that Way, no, our Conſtitution has (bleſſed be God) given us an Opportunity, if not to have ſuch Wrongs redreſſed, yet by our Prudence and Reſolution we may in a great Meaſure prevent the committing of ſuch Wrongs, by making a Governour ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it is his intereſt to be juſt to thoſe under his Care; for ſuch is the Senſe that Men in General (I mean Freemen) have of common Juſtice, that when they come to know, that a chief Magiſtrate abuſes the Power with which he is truſted, for the good of the People, and is attempting to turn that very Power againſt the Innocent, whether of high or low degree, I ſay, Mankind in general ſeldom fail to interpoſe, and as far as they can, prevent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their fellow Subjects. And has it not often been ſeen (and I hope it will always be ſeen) that when the Repreſentatives of a free People are by juſt Repreſentations or Remonſtrances, made ſenſible of the Sufferings of their Fellow-Subjects, by the Abuſe of Power in the Hands of a Governour, they have declared (and loudly too) that they were not obliged by any Law to ſupport a Governour who goes about to deſtroy a Province or Colony, or their
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004107_0027_1003C54C0DF63FD0"/>
Priviledges, which by His Majeſty he was appointed, and by the Law he is bound to protect and encourage. But I pray it may be conſidered of what Uſe is this mighty Priviledge, if every Man that ſuffers muſt be ſilent? And if a Man muſt be taken up as a Libeller, for telling his Sufferings to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour? I know it may be anſwered, <hi>Have you not a Legiſlature? Have you not a Houſe of Repreſentatives to whom you may complaint?</hi> And to this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we have. But what then? Is an Aſſembly to be troubled with every Injury done by a Governour? Or are they to hear of nothing but what thoſe in the Adminiſtration will pleaſe to tell them? Or what Sort of a Tryal muſt a Man have? And how is he to be remedied; eſpecially if the Caſe were, as I have known it to happen in <hi>America</hi> in my Time; That a Governour who has Places (I will not Penſions, for I believe they ſeldom give that to another which they can take to themſelves) to beſtow, and can or will keep the ſame Aſſembly (after he has modeled them ſo as to get a Majority of the Houſe in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt) for near <hi>twice Seven Years</hi> together? I pray, what Redreſs is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for an honeſt Man, who makes his Complaint againſt a Governour, to an Aſſembly who may properly enough be ſaid, to be made by the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour againſt whom the Complaint is made? The Thing anſwers it ſelf. No, it is natural, it is a Priviledge, I will go farther, it is a Right which all Freemen claim, and are entitled to complain when they are hurt; they have a Right publickly to remonſtrate the Abuſes of Power, in the ſtrongeſt Terms, to put their Neighbours upon their Guard, againſt the Craft or open Violence of Men in Authority, and to aſſert with Courage the Senſe they have of the Bleſſings of Liberty, the Value they put upon it, and their Reſolution at all Hazards to preſerve it, as one of the greateſt Bleſſings Heaven can beſtow. And when a Houſe of Aſſembly compoſed of honeſt Freemen ſees the general Bent of the Peoples Inclinations, That is it which muſt and will (I'm ſure it ought to) weigh with a Legiſlature, in Spite of all the Craft, Carreſſing and Cajoling, made uſe of by a Governour, to divert them from hearkning to the Voice of their Country. As we all very well underſtand the true Reaſon, why Gentlemen take ſo much Pains and make ſuch great Intereſt to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Governours, ſo is the Deſign of their Apointment not leſs manifeſt. We know his Majeſty's gracious Intentions to his Subjects; he deſires no more than that his People in the Plantations ſhould be kept up to their Duty and Allegiance to the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that Peace may be preſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and Juſtice impartially adminiſtred; that we may be governed ſo as to render us uſeful to our Mother Country, by encouraging us to make and raiſe ſuch Commodities as may be uſeful to <hi>Great Britain.</hi> But will any one ſay, that all or any of theſe good Ends are to be effected, by a Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour's ſetting his People together by the Ears, and by the Aſſiſtance of one Part of the People to plague and plunder the other? The Commiſſion which Governours bear, while they execute the Powers given them, according to the Intent of the Royal Grantor, expreſſed in their Commiſſions, requires and deſerves very great Reverence and Submiſſion; but when a Governour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from the Duty enjoyned him by his Sovereign, and acts as if he was leſs accountable than the Royal Hand that gave him all that Power and Honour which he is poſſeſſed of; this ſets People upon examining and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the Power, Authority and Duty of ſuch a Magiſtrate, and to compare thoſe with his Conduct, and juſt as far as they find he exceeds the Bounds of his Authority, or falls ſhort in doing impartial Juſtice to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under his Adminiſtration, ſo far they very often, in return, come ſhort in their Duty to ſuch a Governour. For Power alone will not make a Man beloved, and I have heard it obſerved. That the Man who was neither good
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004107_0028_1003C54EC79A3A60"/>
nor wiſe before his being made a Governour, never mended upon his Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but has been generally obſerved to be worſe: For Men who are not endued with Wiſdom and Virtue, can only be kept in Bounds by the Law; and by how much the further they think themſelves out of the Reach of the Law, by ſo much the more wicked and cruel Men are. I wiſh there were no Inſtances of the Kind at this Day. And wherever this happens to be the Caſe of a Governour, unhappy are the People under his Adminiſtration, and in the End he will find himſelf ſo too; for the People will neither love him nor ſupport him. I make no Doubt but there are thoſe here, who are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly concerned for the Succeſs of this Proſecution, and yet I hope they are not many, and even ſome of thoſe, I am perſwaded (when they conſider what Lengths ſuch Proſecutions may be carried, and how deeply the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People may be affected by ſuch Means) will not all abide by their preſent Sentiments; I ſay, <hi>Not All:</hi> For the Man who from an Intimacy and Acquaintance with a Governour has conceived a perſonal Regard for him, the Man who has felt none of the Strokes of his Power, the Man who believes that a Governour has a Regard for him and confides in him, it is natural for ſuch Men to wiſh well to the Affairs of ſuch a Governour; and as they may be Men of Honour and Generoſity, may, and no Doubt will, wiſh him Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, ſo far as the Rights and Priviledges of their Fellow Citizens are not affected. But as Men of Honour, I can apprehend nothing from them; they will never exceed that Point. There are others that are under ſtronger Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and thoſe are ſuch, as are in ſome Sort engaged in Support of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's Cauſe, by their own or their Relations Dependance on his Favour, for ſome Poſt or Preferment; ſuch Men have what is commonly called Duty and Gratitude, to influence their Inclinations, and oblige them to go his Lengths. I know Men's Intereſts are very near to them, and they will do much, rather than forgoe the Favour of a Governour, and a Livelihood at the ſame Time; but I can with very juſt Grounds hope, even from thoſe Men, whom I will ſuppoſe to be Men of Honour and Conſcience too, that when they, the Liberty of their Country is in Danger, either by their Concurrence, or even by their Silence, they will like <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and like themſelves, freely make a Sacrifice of any Preferment or Favour rather than be acceſſary to deſtroying the Liberties of their Country, and entailing Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very upon their Poſterity. There are indeed another ſet of Men, of whom I have no Hopes, I mean ſuch, who lay aſide all other Conſiderations, and are ready to joyn with Power in any Shapes, and with any Man or Sort of Men, by whoſe Means or Intereſt they may be aſſiſted to gratify their Malice and Envy againſt thoſe whom they have been pleaſed to hate; and that for no other Reaſon, but becauſe they are Men of Abilities and Integrity, or at leaſt are poſſeſſed of ſome valuable Qualities far ſuperiour to their own. But as Envy is the Sin of the Devil, and therefore very hard, if at all, to be repented, of, I will believe there are but few of this deteſtable and worthleſs Sort of Men, nor will their Opinions or Inclinations have any Influence upon this Tryal. But to proceed; I beg Leave to inſiſt, That the Right of complaining or remonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is natural; And the Reſtraint upon this natural Right is the Law only, and that thoſe Reſtraints can only extend to what is <hi>falſe:</hi> For as it is Truth alone which can excuſe or juſtify any Man for complaining of a bad Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, I as frankly agree, that nothing ought to excuſe a Man who raiſes a falſe Charge or Accuſation, even againſt a private Perſon, and that no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Allowance ought to be made to him, who does ſo againſt a publick Magiſtrate. <hi>Truth</hi> ought to govern the whole Affair of Libels, and yet the Party accuſed runs Riſque enough even then; for if he fails of proving every Tittle
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004107_0029_1003C552E284A798"/>
of what he has wrote, and to the Satisfaction of the Court and Jury too, he may find to his Coſt, that when the Proſecution is ſet or Foot by Men in Power, it ſeldom wants Friends to Favour it. And from thence (it is ſaid) has ariſen the great Diverſity of Opinions among Judges, about what Words were or were not ſcandalous or libelious. I believe will be granted, that there is not greater Uncertainty in any Part of the Law, than about Words of ſcandal; it would be miſpending of the Court's Time to mention the Caſes; they may be ſaid to be numberleſs; and therefore the utmoſt Care ought to be taken in following Precedents; and the Times when the Judgments were given, which are quoted for Authorities in the Caſe of Libels, are much to be regarded. I think it will be agreed, That ever ſince the Time of the Star Chamber, where the moſt arbitrary and deſtructive Judgments and Opinions were given, that ever an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> heard of, at leſt in his own Country: I ſay, Proſecutions for Libels ſince the Time of that arbitrary Court, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the glorious Revolution, have generally been ſet on Foot at the Inſtance of the Crown or its Miniſters; and it is no ſmall Reproach to the Law, that theſe Proſecutions were too often and too much countenanced by the Judges, who held their Places at Pleaſure, (a diſagreeable Tenure to any Officer, but a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous one in the Caſe of a Judge.) To ſay more to this Point may not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And yet I cannot think it unwarrantable, to ſhew the unhappy Influence that a Sovereign has ſometimes had, not only upon Judges, but even upon Parliaments themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It has already been ſhewn, how the Judges differed in their Opinions about the Nature of a Libel, in the Caſe of the ſeven Biſhops. There you ſee three Judges of one Opinion, that is, of a wrong Opinion, in the Judgment of the beſt Men in <hi>England,</hi> and one Judge of a right Opinion. How unhappy might it have been for all of us at this Day, if that Jury had underſtood the Words in that Information as the Court did? Or if they had left it to the Court, to judge whether the Petition of the Biſhops was or was not a Libel? No they took upon them, to their immortal Honour! to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Fact,</hi> and to <hi>underſtand</hi> the Petition of the Biſhops <hi>to be no Libel, that is, to contain no falſhood nor Sedition,</hi> and therefore found them <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> And remarkable is the Caſe of Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton,</hi> who was fined 10,000 <hi>L.</hi> for Writing a Letter, in which, it may be ſaid, none ſaw any Scandal or Falſhood but the Court and Jury; for that Judgment was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards looked upon as a cruel and deteſtable Judgment, and therefore was reverſed by Parliament. Many more Inſtances might be given of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance of Court-Judges, about thoſe Times and before; but I will mention only one Caſe more, and that is the Caſe of Sir <hi>Edward Hales,</hi> who tho' a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> was by King <hi>James</hi> II. prefered to be a Colonel of his Army, notwithſtanding the Statute of 25 <hi>Cha.</hi> 2<hi>d. Chap.</hi> 2. by which it is provided, <hi>That every one that accepts of an Office, Civil or Military, &amp;c. ſhall take the Oaths, ſubſcribe the Declaration, and take the Sacrament, within three Months, &amp;c. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he is diſabled to hold ſuch Office, and the Grant for the ſame to be null and void, and the Party to forfeit</hi> 500 l. Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> did not take the Oaths or Sacrament, and was proſecuted for the 500 <hi>l.</hi> for exerciſing the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Colonel by the Space of three Months, without conforming as in the Act is directed. Sir <hi>Edward</hi> pleads. <hi>That the King by His Letters Patents did diſpence with his taking the Oaths and Sacrament, and ſubſcribing the Declaration, and had pardoned the forfeiture of</hi> 500 <hi>l.</hi> And <hi>whether the King's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation was good, againſt the ſaid Act of Parliament?</hi> was the Queſtion. I ſhall mention no more of this Caſe, than to ſhew how in the Reign of an arbitrary Prince, where Judges hold their Seats at Pleaſure, their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004107_0030_1003C555498B63D0"/>
have not always been ſuch as to make Precedents of, but the Contrary; and ſo it happened in this Caſe where it was ſolemnly judged, <hi>That, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Act of Parliament, made in the ſtrongeſt Terms, for Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, That yet the King had, by his Royal Prerogative, a Power to diſpence with that Law</hi>; and Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> was acquitted by the Judges accordingly. So the King's Diſpenſing Power, being by the Judges ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Act of Parliament, this Law, which the People looked upon as their chief Security againſt Popery and Arbitrary Power, was by this Judgment rendred altogether ineffectual. But this Judgment is ſufficiently expoſed by Sir <hi>Edward Atkins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Edw. Atkins's</hi> Enquiry into the Power of Diſpenſing with paenal Statutes.</note> late one of the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas in his <hi>Enquiry into the King's Power of diſpenſing with paenal Statutes</hi>; where it is ſhewn, <hi>Who it was that firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Diſpenſations; how they came into</hi> England; <hi>what ill Uſe has been made of them there; and all this principally owing to the Countenance given them by the Judges.</hi> He ſays of the Diſpenſing Power, <note n="*" place="margin">Poſtſcript to the <hi>Enquiry, pag.</hi> 51.</note> 
                     <hi>The Pope was the Inventor of it; our Kings have borrowed it from them; and the Judges have from Time to Time nurſed and dreſſed it up, and given it Countenance; and it is ſtill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Growth, and encroaching 'till it has almoſt ſubverted all Law, and made the Regal Power abſolute if not diſolute.</hi> This ſeems not only to ſhew how far Judges have been influenced by Power, and how little Caſes of this Sort, where the Prerogative has been in Queſtion in former Reigns, are to be relied upon for Law: But I think it plainly ſhews too, that a Man may uſe a greater Freedom with the Power of His Sovereign and the Judges in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> than it ſeems he may with the Power of a Governour in the Plantations, who is but a Fellow-Subject. Are theſe Words with which we are charged, like theſe? Do Mr. <hi>Zenger's</hi> Papers contain any ſuch Freedoms with his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour or His Council, as Sir <hi>Edward Atkins</hi> has taken, with the Regal Power and the Judges in <hi>England?</hi> And yet I never heard of any Information brought againſt him for theſe Freedoms.</p>
                  <p>If then upon the whole there is ſo great an Uncertainty among Judges (learned and great Men) in Matters of this Kind; If Power has had ſo great an Influence on Judges; how cautious ought we to be in determining by their Judgments, eſpecially in the Plantations, and in the Caſe of Libels? There is Hereſy in Law, as well as in Religion, and both have changed very much; and we well know that it is not two Centuries ago that a Man would have been burnt as an Heretick, for owning ſuch Opinions in Matters of Religion as are publickly wrote and printed at this Day. They were fallible Men, it ſeems, and we take the Liberty not only to differ from them in religious Opinions, but to condemn them and their Opinions too; and I muſt preſume, that in taking theſe Freedoms in thinking and ſpeaking about Matters of Faith or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, we are in the right: For, tho' it is ſaid there are very great Liberties of this Kind taken in <hi>NeweYork,</hi> yet I have heard of no Information prefered by Mr. Attorney for any Offences of this Sort. From which I think it is pretty clear, That in <hi>New-York</hi> a Man may make very free with his God, but he muſt take ſpecial Care what he ſays of his Governour. It is agreed upon by all Men that this is a Reign of Liberty, and while Men keep within the Bounds of Truth, I hope they may with Safety both ſpeak and write their Sentiments of the Conduct of Men in Power, I men of that Part of their Conduct only, which affects the Liberty or Property of the People under their Adminiſtration; were this to be denied, then the next Step may make them Slaves: For what Notions can be entertained of Slavery, beyond that of ſuffering the greateſt Injuries and Oppreſſions, without the Liberty of complaining; or if they do, to be deſtroyed, Body and Eſtate, for ſo doing?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:004107_0031_1003C556E3061850"/>It is ſaid and inſiſted on by Mr. Attorney, <hi>That Government is a ſacred Thing; That it is to be ſupported and reverenced; It is Government that protects our Perſons and Eſtates; That prevents Treaſons, Murders, Robberies, Riots, and all the Train of Evils that overturns Kingdoms and States, and ruins particular Perſons; and if thoſe in the Adminiſtration eſpecially the Supream Magiſtrate muſt have all their Conduct cenſured by private Men, Government cannot ſubſiſt.</hi> This is called <hi>a Licentiouſneſs not to be tollerated.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>That it brings the Rulers of the People into Contempt, and their Authority not to be regarded, and ſo in the End the Laws cannot be put in Execution.</hi> Theſe I ſay, and ſuch as thoſe, are the general Topicks inſiſted upon by Men in Power, and their Advocates. But I wiſh it might be conſidered at the ſame Time, How often it has happened, that the Abuſe of Power has been the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Cauſe of theſe Evils, and that it was the Injuſtice and Oppreſſion of theſe great Men, which has commonly brought them into Contempt with the People. The Craft and Art of ſuch Men is great, and who, that is the leaſt acquainted with Hiſtory or Law, can be ignorant of the ſpecious Pretences, which have often been made uſe of by Men in Power, to introduce arbitrary Rule, and deſtroy the Liberties of a free People. I will give two Inſtances: and as they are Authorities not to be denied, nor can be miſunderſtood, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they will be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is the Statute of 3 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. The Preamble of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute will prove all, and more than I have alledged. It begins,
<q>The King Our Sovereign Lord remembereth how by unlawful Maintenances, giving of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, Signs and Tokens, &amp;c. untrue Demeanings of Sheriffs in making of Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, and other untrue Returns, by taking of Money, by Injuries, by great Riots and unlawful Aſſemblies; the Policy and good Rule of this Realm is almoſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; and for the not puniſhing theſe Inconveniences, and by Occaſion of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, little or nothing may be found by Inquiry, &amp;c. to the increaſe of Murders, &amp;c. and unſureties of all Men living, and Loſſes of their Lands and Good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Here is a fine and ſpecious Pretence for introducing the Remedy, as it is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is provided by this Act, <hi>that is</hi>; inſtead of being lawfully accuſed by 24 good and lawful Men of the Neighbourhood, and afterwards tried by 12 like lawful Men, here is a Power given to the Lord Chancellor, Lord Treaſurer, the Keeper of the King's privy Seal, or two of them, calling to them a Biſhop, a temporal Lord, and other great Men mentioned in the Act, (who, it is to be obſerved, were all to be Dependants on the Court) to receive Information againſt any Perſon for any of the Miſbehaviours recited in that Act, and by their Diſcretion to examine, and to puniſh them according to their demerit.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Statute I propoſed to mention, is the 11<hi>th</hi> of the ſame King, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> the Preamble of which Act has the like fair Pretences as the former; <hi>for the King calling to his Remembrance the good Laws made againſt the receiving of Liveries, &amp;c. unlawful Extortions, Maintenances, Embracery, &amp;c. unlawful Games, &amp;c. and many other great Enormitys, and Offences committed againſt many good Statutes, to the Diſpleaſure of Almighty God, which,</hi> the Act ſays, <hi>could not, nor yet can, be conveniently puniſhed by the due Order of the Law, except it were firſt found by</hi> 12 <hi>Men, &amp;c. which, for the Cauſes aforeſaid, will not find nor yet preſent the Truth.</hi> And therefore the ſame Statute directs, <hi>that the Juſtices of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſize, and Juſtices of the Peace, ſhall, upon Information for the King before them made, have full Power, by their Diſcretion, to hear and determine all ſuch Offences.</hi> Here are two Statutes that are allowed to have given the deepeſt Wound to the Liberties of the People of <hi>England</hi> of any that I remember to have been made, unleſs it may be ſaid, that the Statute made in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> 8<hi>th,</hi> by which his Proclamations were to have the Effect of Laws, might in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence

be worſe. And yet we ſee the plauſible Pretences found out by the great Men to procure theſe Acts. And it may juſtly be ſaid, That by thoſe Pretences the People of <hi>England</hi> were cheated or aw'd into the Delivering up their antient and ſacred Right of Tryals by Grand and Petit Juries. I hope to be excuſed for this Expreſſion, ſeeing my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> calls it <hi>an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and ſtrange Act,</hi>

                     <hi>that tended in its Execution to the great Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Almighty God, and the utter Subverſion of the common Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe, I think, make out what I alledged, and are flagrant Inſtances of the Influence of Men in Power, even upon the Repreſentatives of a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. From all which I hope it will be agreed, that it is a Duty which all good Men owe to their Country, to guard againſt the unhappy Influence of ill Men when intruſted with Power, and eſpecially againſt their Creatures and Dependants, who, as they are generally more neceſſitous, are ſurely more covetous and cruel. But it is worthy of Obſervation, that tho' the Spirit of Liberty was born down and oppreſſed in <hi>England</hi> at that Time, yet it was not loſt; for the Parliament laid hold of the firſt Opportunity to free the Subject from the many inſufferable Oppreſſions and Outrages committed upon their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Eſtates by Colour of theſe Acts, the laſt of which being deemed the moſt grievous, was repealed in the firſt Year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi> Tho' it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that <hi>Hen.</hi> 7<hi>th.</hi> and his Creatures reap'd ſuch great Advantages by the grievous Oppreſſions and Exactions, <hi>grinding the Faces of the poor Subjects,</hi> as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays, by Colour of this Stature by information only, that a Repeal of this Act could never be obtained during the Life of that Prince. The other Statute being the favourite Law for Supporting arbitrary Power, was continued much longer. The Execution of it was by the great Men of the Realm; and how they executed it, the Senſe of the Kingdom, expreſſed in the 17<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> 1<hi>st.</hi> (by which the Court of Star Chamber, the Soil where Informations grew rankeſt) will beſt declare. In that Statute <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the other Statutes made in the Time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3 <hi>l.</hi> which I think, are no leſs than five, are particularly enumerated as Acts, by which the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Priviledges of the People of <hi>England</hi> were ſecured to them, againſt ſuch oppreſſive Courts as the Star Chamber and others of the like Juriſdiction. And the Reaſon aſſigned for their pulling down the Star Chamber, is <hi>That the Proceedings, Cenſures and Decrees of the Court of Star Chamber, even tho' the great Men of the Realm, nay and a Biſhop too</hi> (holy Man) <hi>were Judges, had by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience been found to be an intolerable Burthen to the Subject, and the Means to introduce an arbitrary Power and Government.</hi> And therefore that Court was taken away, with all the other Courts in that Statute mentioned, having like Juriſdiction.</p>
                  <p>I don't mention this Statute, as if by the taking away the Court of Star Chamber, the Remedy for many of the Abuſes or Offences cenſured there, was likewiſe taken away; no, I only intend by it to ſhew, that the People of <hi>England</hi> ſaw clearly the Danger of truſting their Liberties and Properties to be tried, even by the greateſt Men in the Kingdom, without the Judgment of a Jury of their Equals. They had felt the terrible effects of leaving it to the Judgment of theſe great Men to ſay what was <hi>ſcandalous and ſeditious falſe or ironical.</hi> And if the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> thought this Power of judging was too great to be truſted with Men of the firſt Rank in the Kingdom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Aid of a Jury, how ſacred ſoever their Characters might be, and therefore reſtored to the People their original Right of tryal by Juries I hope to be excuſed for inſiſting, that by the Judgment of a Parliament from whence no Appeal lies, the Jury are the proper Judges, of what is <hi>falſe</hi> at leaſt, if not of what is <hi>ſcandalous and ſeditious.</hi> This is an Authority not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, it is as plain as it is great, and to ſay, that this Act indeed did reſtore to
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:004107_0033_1003A54B88382FE0"/>
the People Tryals by Juries, which was not the Practice of the Star Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but that did not give the Jurors any new Authority, or any Right to try Matters of Law, I ſay this Objection will not avail; for I muſt inſiſt, that where Matter of Law is complicated with Matter of Fact, the Jury have a Right to determine both. As for Inſtance; upon Indictment for Murder, the Jury may, and almoſt conſtantly do, take upon them to judge whether the Evidence will amount to Murder or Manſlaughter, and find accordingly; and I muſt ſay I cannot ſee, why in our Caſe the Jury have not at leaſt as good a Right to ſay, whether our News Papers are a Libel or no Libel, as another Jury has to ſay, whether killing of a Man is Murder or Manſlaughter. The Right of the Jury, to find ſuch a Verdict as they in their Conſcience do think is agreeable to their Evidence, is ſupported by the Authority of <hi>Buſhel's</hi> Caſe, in <hi>Vaghan's Reports, pag.</hi> 135. beyond any Doubt. For, in the Argument of that Caſe, the Chief Juſtice who delivered the Opinion of the Court, lays it down for Law, <hi>That in all General Iſſues, as upon</hi> Non Cul. <hi>in</hi> Treſpaſs, Non Tort.

And in <hi>pag.</hi> 148. the Judge ſubjoins the Reaſon, why it is no Crime for a Jury to differ in Opinion from the Court, where he ſays, <hi>That a Man cannot ſee with another's Eye, nor hear by another's Ear; no more can a Man conclude or infer the Thing by anothers Underſtanding or Reaſoning.</hi> From all which (I inſiſt) it is very plain, <hi>That the Jury are by Law as Liberty (without any affront to the Judgment of the Court) to find both the Law and the Fact, in our Caſe,</hi> as they did in the Caſe I am ſpeaking to, which I will beg Leave juſt to mention, and it was this. Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>Mead</hi> being Quakers, and having met in a peaceable Manner, after being ſhut out of their Meeting Houſe, preached in <hi>Grace Church Street</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> to the People of their own Perſwaſion, and for this they were indicted; and it was ſaid, <hi>That they with other Perſons, to the Number of</hi> 300. <hi>unlawfully and tumultuouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, to the Diſturbance of the Peace, &amp;c.</hi> To which they pleaded, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi> And the Petit Jury being ſworn to try the Iſſue between the King and the Priſoners, that is, whether they were Guilty, according to the Form of the Indictment? Here there was no Diſpute but they were aſſembled together, to the Number mentioned in the Indictment; But, <hi>Whether that Meeting together was riotouſly, tumultuouſly, and to the Diſturbance of the Peace?</hi> was the Queſtion. And the Court told the Jury it was, and ordered the Jury to find it ſo; <hi>For</hi> (ſaid the Court) <hi>the Meeting was the Matter of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004107_0034_1003C55D85B6CC90"/>
Fact, and that is confeſſed, and we tell you it is unlawful, for it is againſt the Statute; and the Meeting being unlawful, it follows of Courſe that it was tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and to the Diſturbance of the Peace.</hi> But the Jury did not think fit to take the Courts Word for it, for they could neither find <hi>Riot, Tumult,</hi> or any Thing tending to the <hi>Breach of the Peace</hi> committed at that Meeting; and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> and <hi>Mead.</hi> In doing of which they took upon them to judge both the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Fact,</hi> at which the Court (being themſelves true Courtiers) were ſo much offended, that they fined the Jury 40 Marks a piece, and committed them till paid. But Mr. <hi>Buſhel,</hi> who valued the Right of a Juryman and the Liberty of his Country more than his own, refuſed to pay the Fine, and was reſolved (tho' at a great Expence and trouble too) to bring, and did bring, his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> to be relieved from his Fine and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and he was releaſed accordingly; and this being the Judgment in his Caſe, it is eſtabliſhed for Law, <hi>That the Judges, how great ſoever they be, have no Right to fine impriſon or puniſh a Jury, for not finding a Verdict according to the Direction of the Court.</hi> And this I hope is ſufficient to prove, That Jurymen are to ſee with their own Eyes, to hear with their own Ears, and to make uſe of their own Conſciences and Underſtandings, in judging of the Lives, Liberties or Eſtates of their fellow Subjects. And ſo I have done with this Point.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſecond Information for Libelling of a Governour that I have known in <hi>America.</hi> And the firſt, tho' it may look like a Romance, yet as it is true, I will beg Leave to mention it. Governour <hi>Nicholſon</hi> who happened to be offended with one his Clergy, met him one Day upon the Road, and as was uſual with him (under the Protection of his Commiſſion) uſed the poor Parſon with the worſt of Language, threatned to cut off his Ears, ſlit his Noſe, and at laſt to ſhoot him through the Head. The Parſon being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Man, continued all this Time uncovered in the Heat of the Sun, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he found an Opportunity to fly for it; and coming to a Neighbours Houſe felt himſelf very ill of a Feaver, and immediately writes for a Doctor; and that his Phyſician might the better judge of his Diſtemper, he acquainted him with the Uſage he had received; concluding, that the Governour was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mad, for that no Man in his Senſes would have behaved in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The Doctor unhappily ſhews the Parſons Letter; the Governour came to hear of it; and ſo an Information was prefered againſt the poor Man for ſaying <hi>he believed the Governour was mad</hi>; and it was laid in the Information to be <hi>falſe, ſcandalous</hi> and <hi>wicked, and wrote with Intent to move Sedition among the People, and bring His Excellency into Contempt.</hi> But by an Order from the late Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> there was a Stop put to that Proſecution, with ſundry others ſet on foot by the ſame Governour, againſt Gentlemen of the greateſt Worth and Honour in that Government.</p>
                  <p>And may not I be allowed, after all this, to ſay, That by a little Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, almoſt any Thing which a Man writes, may, with the Help of that uſeful Term of Art, called an <hi>Innuendo,</hi> be conſtrued to be a Libel, according to Mr. Attorney's Definition of it, That <hi>whether the Words are ſpoke of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a publick Character, or of a private Man, whether dead or Living, good or bad, true or falſe</hi> all make Libel; for according to Mr. Attorney, <hi>after a Man hears a Writing read, or reads and repeats it, or laughs at it, they are all puniſhable.</hi> It is true, Mr. Attorney is ſo good as to allow, <hi>after the Party knows it to be a Libel,</hi> but he is not ſo kind as to take the Man's Word for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here were ſeveral Caſes put to ſhew, That tho' what a Man writes of a Governour was true, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and neceſſary, yet according to the forgoing Doctrine it might be conſtrued to be a Libel: But Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> after the Tryal was over, being informed, That ſome of the Caſes he had put had really happened in this Government, he declared he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Hamilton.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>If a Libel is underſtood in the large and unlimited Senſe urged by Mr. Attorney, there is ſcarce a Writing I know that may not be called a Libel, or ſcarce any Perſon ſafe from being called to an Account as a Libeller: For <hi>Moſes,</hi> meek as he was, libelled <hi>Cain</hi>; and who is it that has not libelled the Devil? For according to Mr. Attorney, it is no Juſtification to ſay one has a bad Name. <hi>Echard</hi> has libelled our good King <hi>William: Burnet</hi> has libelled among many others King <hi>Charles</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>; and <hi>Rapin</hi> has libelled them all. How muſt a Man ſpeak or write, or what muſt he hear, read, or ſing? Or when muſt he laugh, ſo as to be ſecure from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken up as a Libeller? I ſincerely believe, that were ſome Perſons to go thro' the Streets of <hi>New-York</hi> now-a-days, and read a Part of the Bible, if it was not known to be ſuch, Mr. Attorney, with the Help of his <hi>Innuendo's,</hi> would eaſily turn it into a Libel. As for Inſtance, <hi>Iſ.</hi> IX. 16. <hi>The Leaders of the People cauſe them to err, and they that are led by them are deſtroyed.</hi> But ſhould Mr. Attorney go about to make this a Libel, he would read it thus; <hi>The Leaders of the People [innuendo,</hi> the Governour and Council of <hi>New-York] cauſe them [innuendo,</hi> the People of this Province] <hi>to err, and they</hi> [the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Province meaning] <hi>that are led by them</hi> [the Governour and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil meaning] <hi>are deſtroyed [innuendo,</hi> are deceived into the Loſs of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty] which is the worſt Kind of Deſtruction. Or if ſome Perſons ſhould publickly repeat, in a Manner not pleaſing to his Betters, the 10<hi>th</hi> and 11<hi>th</hi> Verſes of the LVI. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the ſame Book, there Mr. Attorney would have a large Field to diſplay his Skill, in the artful Application of his <hi>Innuendo's.</hi> The Words are, <hi>His Watchmen are all blind, they are ignorant, &amp;c. Yea, they are greedy Dogs, that can never have enough.</hi> But to make them a Libel, there is according to Mr. Attorney's Doctrine, no more wanting but the Aid of his Skill, in the right adapting his <hi>Innuendo's.</hi> As for Inſtance; <hi>His Watchmen [innuendo,</hi> the Governour's Council and Aſſembly] <hi>are blind, they are ignorant [innuendo,</hi> will not ſee the dangerous Deſigns of His Excellency] <hi>Yea, they</hi> [the Governour and Council meaning] <hi>are greedy Dogs, which can never have enough [innuendo,</hi> enough of Riches and Power]. Such an Inſtance as this is ſeems only only fit to be laugh'd at; but I may appeal to Mr. Attorney him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether theſe are not at leaſt equally proper to be applied to His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and His Miniſters, as ſome of the Inferences and <hi>Innuendo's</hi> in his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt my Client. Then if Mr. Attorney is at Liberty to come into Court, and file an Information in the Kings Name, without Leave, who is ſecure, whom he is pleaſed to proſecute as a Libeller? And as the Crown Law is contended for in bad Times, there is no Remedy for the greateſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this Sort, even tho the Party proſecuted is acquitted with Honour. And give me Leave to ſay, as great Men as any in <hi>Britain,</hi> have boldly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Mode of Proſecuting by Information (when a Grand Jury will not find <hi>Billa vera</hi>) is a national Grievance, and greatly inconſiſtent with that Freedom, which the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> enjoy in moſt other Caſes. But if we are ſo unhappy as not to be able to ward off this Stroke of Power directly, yet let us take Care not be cheated out of our Liberties, by Forms and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; let us always be ſure that the Charge in the Information is made out clearly even beyond a Doubt; for tho Matters in the Information may be called <hi>Form</hi> upon Tryal, yet they may be, and often have been found to be <hi>Matters of Subſtance</hi> upon giving Judgment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gentlemen</hi>; The Danger is great, in Proportion to the Miſchief that may happen, through our too great Credulity. A proper Confidence in a Court is commendable; but as the Verdict (what ever it is) will be yours, you ought to refer no Part of your Duty to the Diſcretion of other Perſons.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004107_0036_1003C561E2E4CCE0"/>
If you ſhould be of Opinion, that there is no Falſhood in Mr. <hi>Zenger's</hi> Papers, you will, nay (pardon me for the Expreſſion) you ought to ſay ſo; becauſe you don't know whether others (I mean the Court) may be of that Opinion. It is your Right to do ſo, and there is much depending upon your Reſolution, as well as upon your Integrity.</p>
                  <p>The loſs of liberty to a generous Mind, is worſe than Death; and yet we know there have been thoſe in all Ages, who for the ſake of Preferment, or ſome imaginary Honour, have freely lent a helping Hand, to oppreſs, nay to deſtroy their Country. This brings to my Mind that ſaying of the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Brutus,</hi> when he look'd upon the Creatures of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who were very great Men, but by no Means good Men.
<q>You <hi>Romans</hi> ſaid <hi>Brutus,</hi> if yet I may call you ſo, conſider what you are doing; remember that you are aſſiſting <hi>Caeſar</hi> to forge thoſe very Chains, which one Day he will make your ſelves wear.</q>
This is what every Man (that values Freedom) ought to conſider: He ſhould act by Judgment and not by Affection or Self-Intereſt; for, where thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, No Ties of either Country or Kindred are regarded, as upon the other Hand, the Man, who loves his Country, prefers it's Liberty to all other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, well knowing that without Liberty, Life is a Miſery.</p>
                  <p>A famous Inſtance of this you will find in the Hiſtory of another brave <hi>Roman</hi> of the ſame Name, I mean <hi>Lucius Junius Brutus,</hi> whoſe ſtory is well known and therefore I ſhall mention no more of it, than only to ſhew the Value he put upon the Freedom of his Country. After this great Man, with his Fellow Citizens whom he had engag'd in the Cauſe, had baniſh'd <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Proud, the laſt King of <hi>Rome,</hi> from a Throne which he aſcended by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Murders and poſſeſs'd by the moſt dreadful Tyranny and Proſcriptions, and had by this Means, amaſs'd incredible Riches, even ſufficient to bribe to his Intereſt, many of the young Nobility of <hi>Rome,</hi> to aſſiſt him in recovering the Crown; but the Plot being diſcover'd, and principal Conſpirators were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, among whom were two of the Sons of <hi>Junius Brutus.</hi> It was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary that ſome ſhould be made Examples of, to deter others from attempting the reſtoring of <hi>Tarquin</hi> and deſtroying the Liberty of <hi>Rome.</hi> And to effect this it was, that <hi>Lucius Junius Brutus</hi> one of the Conſuls of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Preſence of the <hi>Roman</hi> People, ſat Judge and condemned his own Sons, as Traitors to their Country: And to give the laſt Proof of his exalted Virtue, and his Love of Liberty: He with a Firmneſs of Mind, (only becoming ſo great a Man) caus'd their Heads to be ſtruck off in his own Preſence; and when he obſerv'd that his rigid Virtue, occaſion'd a ſort of Horror among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is obſerv'd he only ſaid.
<q>My Fellow-Citizens, do not think that this Proceeds from any Want of natural Affection: No, The Death of the Sons of <hi>Brutus</hi> can affect <hi>Brutus</hi> only; but the Loſs of Liberty will affect my Country.</q>
Thus highly was Liberty eſteem'd in thoſe Days that a Father could ſacrifice his Sons to ſave his Country, But why do I go to Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> to bring Inſtances of the Love of Liberty, the beſt Blood in <hi>Britain</hi> has been ſhed in the Cauſe of Liberty; and the Freedom we enjoy at this Day, may be ſaid to be (in a great Meaſure) owing to the glorious Stand the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Hamden,</hi> and other of our Countrymen, made againſt the arbitrary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and illegal Impoſitions, of the Times in which they lived; Who rather than give up the Rights of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and ſubmit to pay an illegal Tax of no more, I think, than 3 Shillings, reſolv'd to undergo, and for their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their Country did undergo the greateſt Extremities, in that arbitrary and terrible Court of Star Chamber, to whoſe arbitrary Proceedings, (it being compos'd of the principal Men of the Realm, and cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ulated to ſupport arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government) no Bounds or Limits could be ſet, nor could any other Hand remove the Evil but a Parliament.</p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="unknown:004107_0037_1003C565F0F0E670"/>Power may juſtly be compar'd to a great River, while kept within it's due Bounds, is both Beautiful and Uſeful; but when it overflows, it's Banks, it is then too impetuous to be ſtemm'd, it bears down all before it, and brings Deſtruction and Deſolation wherever it comes. If then this is the Nature of Power, let us at leaſt do our Duty, and like wiſe Men (who value Freedom) uſe our utmoſt Care to ſupport Liberty, the only Bulwark againſt lawleſs Power, which in all Ages has ſacrificed to it's wild Luſt and boundleſs Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, the Blood of the beſt Men that ever liv'd.</p>
                  <p>I hope to be pardon'd Sir for my Zeal upon this Occaſion; it is an old and wiſe Caution. <hi>That when our Neighbours Houſe is on Fire, we ought to take Care of our own.</hi> For tho' Bleſſed be God, I live in a Government where Liberty is well underſtood, and freely enjoy'd; yet Experience has ſhewn us all (I'm ſure it has to me) that a bad Precedent in one Government, is ſoon ſet up for an Authority in another; and therefore I cannot but think it mine, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Honeſt Man's Duty, that (while we pay all due Obedience to Men in Authority) we ought at the ſame Time to be upon our Guard againſt Power, wherever we apprehend that it may affect ourſelves or our Fellow-Subjects.</p>
                  <p>I am truly very unequal to ſuch an Undertaking on many Accounts. And you ſee I labour under the Weight of many Years, and am born down with great Infirmities of Body; yet Old and Weak as I am, I ſhould think it my Duty if required, to go to the utmoſt Part of the Land, where my Service cou'd be of any Uſe in aſſiſting to quench the Flame of Proſecutions upon Informations, ſet on Foot by the Government, to deprive a People of the Right of Remonſtrating, (and complaining too) of the arbitrary Attempts of Men in Power. Men who injure and oppreſs the People under their Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration provoke them to cry out and complain; and then make that very Complaint the Foundation for new Oppreſſions and Proſecutions. I wiſh I could ſay there were no Inſtances of this Kind. But to conclude; the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before the Court and you Gentlemen of the Jury, is not of ſmall nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Concern, it is not the Cauſe of a poor Printer, nor of <hi>New-York</hi> alone, which you are now trying: No! It may in it's Conſequence, affect every Freeman that lives under a Britiſh Government on the main of <hi>America,</hi> It is the beſt Cauſe. It is the Cauſe of Liberty, and I make no Doubt but your upright Conduct, this Day, will not only entitle you to the Love and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of your Fellow-Citizens; but every Man who prefers Freedom to a Life of ſlavery will bleſs and honour You, as Men who have baffled the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Tyranny; and by an impartial and uncorrupt Verdict, have laid a noble Foundation for ſecuring to ourſelves, our Poſterity, and our Neighbours, That, to which Nature and the Laws of our Country have given us a Right, — The Liberty— both of expoſing and oppoſing arbitrary Power (in theſe Parts of the World, at leaſt) by ſpeaking and writing Truth.</p>

                  <hi>Here Mr. Attorney obſerv'd, that Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> had gone very much out of the Way, and had made himſelf and the People very merry: But that he had been citing Caſes, not at all to the Purpoſe; he ſaid, there was no ſuch Cauſe as Mr. <hi>Buſhel</hi>'s or Sir <hi>Edward Hales</hi> before the Court; and he could not find out what the Court or Jury had to do with Diſpenſations, Riots or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Aſſemblies: All that the Jury had to conſider of was Mrs. <hi>Zenger</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Publiſhing two ſcandalous Libels, which very highly reflected on his Excellency and the principal Men concern'd in the Adminiſtration of this Government, which is confeſs'd.

                  <q>
                     <p>To ſay that corrupt Officers are appointed to adminiſter Affairs, is certainly a Reflection on the Government. If People ſhould not be called to account for poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the People with an ill Opinion of the Government, no Government can ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, For it is very neceſſary for all Governments that the People ſhould have a good Opinion of it. And nothing can be worſe to any Government, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to procure Animoſities; as to the Management of it, this has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look'd upon as a Crime, and no Government can be ſafe without it be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                     <p>Now you are to conſider, whether theſe Words I have read to you, do not tend to beget an ill Opinion of the Adminiſtration of the Government? To tell us, that thoſe that are employed know nothing of the Matter, and thoſe that do know are not employed. Men are not adapted to Offices, but Offices, to Men out of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Regard to their Intereſt, and not to their Fitneſs for the Places; this is the Purport of theſe Papers.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>I humbly beg Your Honours Pardon: I am very much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehended, if you ſuppoſe what I ſaid was ſo deſigned.</p>
                  <p>Sir, you know; I made an Apology for the Freedom I found my ſelf under a Neceſſity of uſing upon this Occaſion. I ſaid, there was Nothing perſonal deſigned; it aroſe from the Nature of our Defence.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The Jury withdrew and in a ſmall Time returned and being aſked by the Clerk whether they were agreed of their Verdict, and whether <hi>John Peter Zenger</hi> was guilty of Printing and Publiſhing the Libels in the Information mentioned? They anſwered by <hi>Thomas Hunt,</hi> their Foreman, <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> Upon which there were three Huzzas in the Hall which was crowded with People and the next Day I was diſcharged from my Impriſonment.</p>
