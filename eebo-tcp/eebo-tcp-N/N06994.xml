            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>You told us by this Belt, three Years ago, that you removed this, which is but a little Fire, to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> where our Anceſtors formerly kindled their great Fire, and made all their Alliances and Treaties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>By this other Belt, you at the ſame Time cleared the Road to the Great Council Fire, at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and removed all Obſtructions out of it, that it might be open for us to paſs in Safety.</p>

            <p>By this String you wiped the Sweat from our Bodies, took the Thorns from our Legs and Feet, cleared our Throats, and opened our Hearts; we thank you, and return it you again.</p>

            <p>Theſe three Belts were brought to us, the <hi>Onondagoes,</hi> by the <hi>Oneidas,</hi> but they brought no Speeches with them; we therefore return them to you again, for, as they are your own Belts, you may know their Meaning;—we do not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One Belt of eleven, one of eight, and one of ſeven Rows, black and white.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being aſked whether they were brought all together, or at different Times, they anſwered, that they were all brought by one Meſſenger, about a Year ago, which Meſſenger was an <hi>Oneida,</hi> but that they do not know his Name.—Being aſked how the <hi>Oneida</hi> came by them, and what he ſaid, they anſwered, that he ſaid no more, but that they were about the Governor's Buſineſs.</p>

               <hi>Papounan,</hi> by one of his <hi>Indians,</hi> called <hi>Tougachena,</hi> living at <hi>Wighalouſin,</hi> then ſpoke to the Governor as follows.</p>
            <p>Agreeable to your Requeſt, when I was at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> laſt Summer, I carried your Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>Achoan,</hi> the Chief of the <hi>Miniſinks,</hi> reſpecting his ſending the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners, and I now deliver to you <hi>Achoan</hi>'s Anſwer.</p>

               <q>You deſired me laſt Year that I ſhould clear myſelf, as your Brothers that live at Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halouſin did, by which you would have a Proof of my Friendſhip. After I received your Meſſage, I took it away to my Uncles, the <hi>Senecas,</hi> and delivered to them what you had ſaid to me, upon which they adviſed me to deliver up all the Captives: Now Brother, I would have you not be impatient, and I will come as ſoon as poſſible. I will hunt up all the Captives that are amongſt us, and will not leave one, but will bring them all;—but I have not found them all. I expect to come when the Corn is ripe; but if I ſhould fail then, I will certainly come by the Spring.</q>

            </p>
            <p>I INTEND to take no other Method, than what I have already agreed with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor. Brother, now I take the ſoft Feather to clear your Ears, which our Grandfathers uſed for the ſame Purpoſe, that you may hear diſtinctly whatever I may ſay.</p>

            <p>I deſire you would now hear me; I beg you would frame that good Heart God has given you in a right Way, that you may ſenſibly feel, and have a right Underſtanding, of what I am going to ſay to you.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I am come here to this Place, where we met about three Years ago. I then told you, I would take that Medicine which our Maker has ordered for us, to apply to any Wounds we may have. I likewiſe told you, that I do not apply it any where but where the Wound is—I have now come to ſee whether the Wound is healed, or no.</p>

            <p>You then told me, when you looked on the Road our Grandfathers laid out, that you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved many Buſhes and much Graſs grown there, ſo that you could not ſee me. You then took me by the Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All my young Men, as far as the Tweteeway Nations, have let me know, that they intend firmly to join in and ſtand to whatever you and I have agreed on; and alſo thoſe young Men I have with me, <hi>Mohickons, Opies, and Delawares,</hi> ſay they will not take Notice of what few drops of Blood have ſtained our Road, but will look ſteady to our Agreement.</p>

            <p>Obſerve what I am going to ſay, and I will let you know we have cleared ourſelves, as far as <hi>Makahelouſink, Papounan</hi>'s Houſe. I will aſſure you, that I want to make a Peace between us as laſting as the World. I call the Almighty to witneſs, that I have no Captives in my Poſſeſſion, as far as Makahelouſink.</p>

            <p>I have one Thing more to ſay: I would not have you look to me any more for any Thing, for I believe nothing will ever make us differ again, except it is your Fault, for I am ſure nothing on my Part ſhall cauſe it; therefore, if any Thing ſhould fall out, examine your own Hearts, for it muſt ſpring from you, becauſe all our young Men have put it into the Care of their Chiefs to manage Affairs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Our Grandfathers uſed to hold great Treaties of Peace and good Friendſhip, now we that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them will do the ſame; they uſed to agree that we ſhould have one Ear and one Eye, now you ſit at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> and I am away in the Country, and whatever one hears or ſees, the other ſhould hear it and ſee it alſo, becauſe we are Brothers.</p>

            </p>
            <p>As I told you juſt now that we have one Ear, I deſire you would hear me: My Uncles, the <hi>Seven Nations,</hi> that ſit here now, deſire me to leave <hi>Wyoming,</hi> for Fear; I anſwered,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008887_0006_10308F300DD89610"/>I will not leave it ſo ſuddenly; but, if I ſhould ſee any Danger, I will endeavour to jump out of the Way of that Danger.</p>

<q>if you ſee <hi>Engliſh</hi> Brethren coming over the Mountains, you muſt light your Pipe, and come to us (the <hi>Mingoes</hi>) and we will receive you.</q>

            <p>It is about three Years ago that I deſired my Uncles would give me a Deed for the Lands at <hi>Wyoming,</hi> but as they have not done it, I believe I ſhall get up and leave it; for you know, according to your Cuſtom, you hold all Lands by Deeds, and if our Uncles had given us a Deed, our Children would enjoy them after us: If they had given me a Deed, my Children and Grandchildren would live there as long as the World laſts; but as that is not done, I believe I ſhall leave it.</p>

            <p>We are very ſenſible, with you, that both of us have ſuſtained a very heavy Loſs, by the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008887_0007_10308F354CAD7BC0"/>Death of our old and good Friend <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> who was an able, experienced and faithful Interpreter, and one of the Council of the <hi>Seven Nations,</hi> and that ſince his Death we, as well as you, have ſat in Darkneſs, and are at a great Loſs for Want of well underſtanding what we ſay to one another: We mourn, with you, for his Death, and heartily join in covering his Body with Bark.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Belt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this belt we diſpel the dark Clouds, which you have juſtly obſerved the Death of our good Friend has occaſioned, and make the Sky perfectly clear again, that we may behold the Light all the Day long: We eaſe your Hearts from the Grief you were under, on this mournful Account, and we pray God that we may for ever live together in Peace and Love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Belt.</hi>

               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus paid our Regards to our deceaſed Friend, we cannot but obſerve, with you, that there is a Neceſſity of appointing ſome other Perſon to ſucceed him, by whoſe Aſſiſtance we may be enabled to find the true Senſe and Meaning of what there may be Occaſion to ſay to one another, either in Council, or by Letters, or Meſſages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Conformity to the ancient Cuſtom of taking from among the Relations of any great Man who dies, ſome fit Perſon to ſupply his Place (as Mr. <hi>Weiſer</hi> was by Adoption one of the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> though by birth one of us) we think you did well to caſt your Eyes upon one of his Children, and, inaſmuch as <hi>Samuel Weiſer</hi> is the only one amongſt them who has any Knowledge of the <hi>Indian</hi> Language, and has lived among you, we ſhall be glad to make Trial of him for the preſent, and if we find him capable of ſerving in the Office of an Interpreter, and in the Management of <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs (in both which Capacities his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo well acquitted himſelf) we ſhall appoint him to that Service. We look upon this Choice of yours as a Mark of your grateful Affection for <hi>Conrad Weiſer,</hi> who was always your ſincere Friend; and we join this Belt to yours, as Token of our Concurrence, ſo far as to make Trial of him.</p>

            <p>I have now anſwered every Thing that you, of the <hi>Seven United Nations,</hi> ſaid to me at our laſt Meeting. I now addreſs myſelf to <hi>Jenochryada,</hi> the <hi>Onondagoe</hi> Chief, to anſwer the Meſſage he ſent to me by <hi>Ashenoch.</hi>

               <hi>Brother</hi> Jenochryada.</p>
            <p>You tell me that <hi>James Sherlock</hi> has for ſome Time paſt lived with you. I am glad to hear he has behaved in ſuch a Manner as to obtain your good Opinion of him, and I hope he will continue to prove himſelf worthy of your Confidence: I have no Objection to his living among you, or to your employing him in any Buſineſs you may have to tranſact with us, which you think him capable of executing; but as he is a young Man, and quite a Stranger to me. I cannot conſent to employ him as an Interpreter for this Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I have as full an Experience of his Abilities and good Diſpoſition as you have had. In the mean Time, if I ſhould have any Occaſion of ſending Meſſages or Letters to your Nation, I ſhall commit the Care of them to Meſſengers of my own; and deſire you will obſerve the ſame Method, as the likelieſt Means to our right underſtanding of one another, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miſtakes, which might otherwiſe happen.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren of the</hi> Seven United Nations,</p>
            <p>You told me, that three Years ago, at a Treaty held here. I invited you, by this Belt, to come down in great Numbers as you were not then all preſent, and that, as you all were now here, you returned me this Belt, and were glad to ſee as here Face to Face.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Counſellors well remember, that this Belt was given you by the late Governor of this Province, at the laſt Treaty, but you ſeem to have miſtaken the End and Purpoſe for which it was given: I muſt therefore inform you, that it was given to you as a Peace Belt, by which we then renewed our old Treaties, brightened the Chain of Friendſhip, confirmed our former Union, and put freſh Earth to the Roots of the Tree of Peace, that it might bear up againſt every Storm, and live and flouriſh to the End of Time, whilſt the Sun ſhould ſhine, and the Rivers run; and we then further deſired you would publiſh this good News among your own and all other <hi>Indian</hi> Nations, who were your Friends and Allies, and engage them to join with you in a firm Peace with our great King, and all his People. All this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the Minutes of that Treaty, taken down to Writing at that Time; you ought
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008887_0008_10308F370797A250"/>therefore to preſerve this Belt, as a Blood or Earneſt of the Engagements are then made to one another, and keep it ſafe in your Boſoms, and I now return it year for that Purpoſe</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Peace Belt returned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You informed us that this String was ſent from Seven Nations of Indians over the Lakes, who have formerly been in the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, but have lately entered into your Alliance, deſiring they might lay Hold with you, of one End of the Chain of Friendſhip, that ſuſiſts between you and the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It gaves me great Pleaſure to hear that you have ſtrengthened your Intereſt by entering into to an Alliance with theſe Seven Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> who have been formerly in the Intereſt of the <hi>French.</hi> You and I are one Fleſh and Blood, and I ſhall love and eſteem all <hi>Indians</hi> whatſoever, who are in your Friendſhip; I will take this String, and ſend it to the Kings Commander in Chief, and <hi>Sir William Johnſon,</hi> and let them know the Deſire thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> have of entering into Friendſhip and Alliance with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and I make to Doubt but they with receive them with open Arms. To confirm my Words, I give you this String.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A String.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very much ſurprized to hear from you, that theſe three Belt were brought to the <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ondagoe</hi> Council by an <hi>Oneida Indian,</hi> about a Year ago, without any Speeches or Meſſages to attend them. I can aſſure you, I did not ſend theſe Belts to the <hi>Onondagoe</hi> Council, and therefore I am at a loſſ to know the Meaning of them, or from whom they came. I have frequently ſent Meſſages into the <hi>Indian</hi> Country, to put them in Mind of their Promiſe to return to us our Fleſh and Blood, who are priſoners among them, and to preſs them to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil that Promiſe; and it is poſſible, that the Belt ſent with the Meſſengers for that Purpoſe may have been forwarded to the <hi>Six Nation</hi> Council by miſtake; I therefore now return you the Belt, that you may make further Enquiry of the <hi>Oneidas</hi> about them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Belts returned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You acquainted me, by theſe three Belts, firſt, that you were coming to ſee me, and were got as far as <hi>Wyoming;</hi> by the ſecond, you deſired me to meet you <hi>at Eaſton;</hi> by the third, you deſired me to ſtop ſtrong Drink, and ſend you Waggons, Proviſions, and Paint. As I have complied with theſe ſeveral Requeſt, I now return you the Belts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The three Belts returned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeveral other Belts and Strings which you received from us at the laſt Treaty, and were returned by you to me the Day before Yeſterday, I have accepted, and put into the Council Bag.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever may be the Occaſion of your coming down at this Time, I can truly ſay, I am glad to ſee my old Friends and Brethren once more, and take them by the Hand, and will make you as welcome and eaſy, while you ſtay among us, as I poſſibly can. I have only further to ſay to you at preſent, that as we are now Face to Face, we ſhould open our Hearts to one another, and let nothing remain upon our Minds; if you, on your Part, have any Thing to offer or communicate to me, that relates to the private Intereſt or Concerns of this Province, or that can tend to promote and confirm our Friendſhip, and prevent all future Cauſes of Jealouſy and Diſcontent, I ſhall be glad to hear it.</p>

            <p>PRESENT, <hi>The Honorable</hi> JAMES HAMILTON, <hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr>

            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>I AM to ſpeak a few Words to you. We had a great Council Fire at <hi>Albany,</hi> when a Friendſhip was firſt made with our Grandfathers; after which, about ſeven Years ago, our Brother General <hi>Johnſon</hi> moved the Council Fire from <hi>Albany</hi> to his own Houſe, where he ſaid to us. <q>I am one Half <hi>Indian,</hi> and one Half <hi>Engliſh:</hi> What I ſay to my dear Brethren, the <hi>Seven Nations,</hi> ſhall be true.</q>—The <hi>Seven Nations</hi> were accordingly all aſſembled to the Place where he had kindled the Fire, at which Time he took up a Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk, gave it them, and told them, he was going to War againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and deſired
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008887_0009_10308F39E2E5E238"/>them to join with him, and promiſed them, that after the <hi>French</hi> were all conquered and removed, Trade ſhould be made open and free to them, and all Kinds of Goods ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more cheap, and that their Furs and Skins ſhould bear a good Price.—</p>
            <p>Laſt Year General <hi>Johnſon</hi> appointed his Brethren, the <hi>Seven Nations,</hi> to meet him at <hi>Oſwego,</hi> upon which they did aſſemble there; at which Time General <hi>Johnſon</hi> obſerving that their Chiefs and Warriors were not all come, he ſent a ſecond Meſſage, deſiring them all to attend him there, and when they did come he ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am very glad to ſee you here. I ſee many of your Chiefs are dead. I am now going againſt the <hi>French,</hi> and out of the Priſoners that I ſhall take from them, I will put as many in their Room.</q>—Now, Brother <hi>Onas,</hi> as General <hi>Johnſon</hi> has not performed his Promiſe to us, we ſee Death coming upon us, and the God above knows he has wronged us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We give no Belt or String upon this Occaſion, and only relate it as Matter of Information to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>Liſten to what your Brethren of the <hi>Seven Nations</hi> ſay, in Anſwer to what you told us Yeſterday.</p>
            <p>You deſired us to open our Hearts, that nothing unknown might lay hid there, but that every Thing may come out: We deſire, by this Belt, that you may do the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A white Belt of eight Rows, with three black Bars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We ſee, Brethren, on each Side of us: On the one Side, the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> who does not ſpeak or do right to us; on the other Side, General <hi>Johnſon,</hi> who does the ſame. We have often heard you ſpeak, and you always do and ſpeak right and juſtly to us; every Time you ſpeak it does our Hearts good. When we look towards you, General <hi>Johnſon</hi> and the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> we eſteem you all as One; how comes it then that you do not all ſpeak alike. We, your Brethren of the <hi>Seven Nations,</hi> are penned up like Hogs. There are Forts all around us, and therefore we are apprehenſive that Death is coming upon us. We want nothing but Friendſhip with you, ſo long as the Sun ſhall ſhine, and the Waters run.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A white Belt of nine Rows, and four black Bars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>Hearken to what your Brethren, the <hi>Seven Nations,</hi> are going to ſay to you. When our Grandfathers firſt made a Friendſhip together, God ſaw it: Now we, and all the Nations, would ſtand to the Agreement they made, and when any Nations ſmile upon us, we will join with them. Now, dear Brother, may God Almighty give us Strength and Knowledge, to continue our Friendſhip. We look at no other, but to you, to hold faſt the Chain of Friendſhip. We are cruſhed on all Sides, ſo that we cannot ſtir ourſelves, nor look any Way but to you.—Now, dear Brother, that we ſee you Face to Face, we deſire that you would not ſlack your Friendſhip, but hold it faſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A black and white Belt of ſeven Rows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>I would only let you know, in a few Words, how our Brother General <hi>Johnſon</hi> ſerved us.—When we come to him for Ammunition, and bring our Skins, he does not give us the Worth of our Skins, but only a Handful of Powder; and for that Reaſon we think there is certain Death coming upon us.—</p>
            <p>He ſhuts up his Powder from us, and will not give us more than will ſerve us two or three Days. We only mention this to you, but if you will continue to ſmile on us, we will look to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A white Belt of ſix Rows, and three black Bars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We are now ſenſible, that we were under a Miſtake with Reſpect to the Meaning of this Belt (holding up the large Peace Belt) We ſhould not have brought it back to you again, if we had known what it meant: We are very glad that you have explained it to us: We look upon it as the Belt of Peace, and will ſhew it to all the Nations over the Lake, and will lodge it in the <hi>Onondagoe</hi> Council, where the only General Council Fire is kept, and where it ought to remain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>This is all your Brethren of the <hi>Seven Nations</hi> have to ſay.</p>

            <p>YOU will pleaſe to hear what the <hi>Six Nations</hi> are going to ſay to you. Some of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ſettled upon our Lands, but we don't know from whence they came. We hope that as you are ſtrong, you will aſſiſt us in preventing them from ſettling upon our Lands, that we may not be wronged out of them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We have heard that this Land has been ſold, but we do not know for certain by whom. The <hi>Six Nations</hi> have not ſold it, and never intended it as yet. Whoever has ſold the Land, ſtole it from us, and only did it to fill their Pockets with Money; but we have heard that two <hi>Tuſcaroras,</hi> one <hi>Oneida,</hi> and one <hi>Mohawk,</hi> have ſold it, unknown to the <hi>Six Nations.</hi>

               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>Hear what we are going to ſay to you.—You know there is a Line made between you and us, and we deſire that none of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would ſettle on the other Side of that Line. [Being aſked what they meant by that Line, they anſwered, the Line of the Purchaſe laſt made by this Province from the <hi>Six Nations.</hi>] Some People have already ſettled over that Line, which People we do not like, and hope you will be ſtrong, and aſſiſt us in having them removed.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We are very poorly off, as we have no Trade ſtirring among us, and as we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to you that the Things we buy from General <hi>Johnſon</hi> are very dear, we hope you will have Pity on us, and erect a Trading-houſe at <hi>Diahoga,</hi> that we may be to buy our Goods cheaper. We are in great Want of all Kinds of Goods, but eſpecially of Powder and Lead, and hope you will ſupply us plentifully with them. We deſire you would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low any ſtrong Liquor to be ſent among us, as we ſhall fetch that ourſelves, whenever we ſhall want it. As ſoon as we ſee your People come with Goods, we will acquaint all our young Men with it, both far and near, and if your Goods are ſold reaſonable, we ſuppoſe that General <hi>Johnſon</hi> will alſo ſell his Goods cheaper than he now does.—We deſire that you would ſend a good and honeſt Man to trade with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Belt of ſeven Rows and four black Bars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>You have frequently ſent us Meſſages by ſtraggling <hi>Indians, Delawares,</hi> and others, upon whom there is no Dependance: They ſometimes loſe the Belts and Meſſages, and ſometimes drink them away; but if they do happen to reach as, they are nothing but Nonſenſe. We deſire you, therefore, that whenever you have Meſſages to ſend, you will ſend them by truſty Perſons to our Great Council Fire at <hi>Onondagoe,</hi> that we may be able to underſtand them rightly; and as we have choſen <hi>Samuel Weiſer</hi> for that Purpoſe, you can always ſend your Meſſages by him.</p>

               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>You have often made Mention of your Fleſh and Blood, who are Priſoners among us. 'Tis true, Brother, there was ſome of your Blood among us; there were Ten among the <hi>Cayugas,</hi> but our Brother General <hi>Johnſon</hi> has alſo often ſpoke of them to us, and we have delivered them all up to him; there is none amongſt us at preſent—You muſt now look for then amongſt the <hi>Delawares,</hi> our Couſins.</p>

               <hi>Brethren of the</hi> Seven United Nations, <hi>and all our</hi> Indian <hi>Brethren now preſent,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU deſire me to open my Heart, and conceal nothing from you. I give you this String, to aſſure you that I will always communicate to you every Thing that comes to my Knowledge, or that riſes up in my Mind, which concerns our common Intereſt, and keep nothing ſecret, but will agree that you and I ſhall have but one Eye, one Ear, and one Heart.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I am very ſorry to hear that you apprehend General <hi>Johnſon</hi> has been unkind to you. I am afraid the Evil Spirit is again endeavouring to blind your Eyes, and miſlead you. You well know that General <hi>Johnſon</hi> has, for a great Number of Years paſt, manifeſted his Love and Friendſhip for the <hi>Indians,</hi> on many Occaſions, and you have as often given Proofs of your Eſteem and good Opinion of him. You ſhould not therefore ſuffer the Confidence and Truſt you have repoſed in him, to be interrupted by any Jealouſies or Suſpicions; but you ſhould open your Hearts to him, and tell him your Minds freely. I am perſuaded he is a very worthy Gentleman, and your good Friend, and if you will lay your Grievances before him, I am ſure be will do you Juſtice, if you have been injured, and remove all your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs.</p>

               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſay that you are afraid Death is coming upon you, and ſeem to apprehend yourſelves to be in great Danger; I am much ſurprized to hear this, nor can I find out what has given Riſe to your Fears, as there is now a perfect Peace and Friendſhip betwixt you and all your Brethren the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> you muſt not therefore make yourſelves uneaſy without any juſt Grounds or Foundation. I ſpeak to you from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of my Heart, and do aſſure you that I never heard, nor do I believe that there are any ill Deſigns forming againſt you.</p>

               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thank you for the particular Affection you expreſs for the People of this Province. We have always made it a Rule to ſpeak to you plainly, and from the Bottom of our Hearts, and to treat you not only juſtly, but with Brotherly Love, and Kindneſs. And it now gives us great Satisfaction to hear that you think ſo well of us. I aſſure you we deſire nothing more, than to live in perfect Peace and Friendſhip with you, as long as the Sun and Moon endures. We will always hold the Chain of Friendſhip in our Hands, and keep it Bright and Free from Ruſt, and in all our future Conduct to, and Dealings with you, continue to uſe you well, and give you every Proof of our Affection and Regard for you.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have carefully conſidered that Part of the Speech you made Yeſterday, wherein you ſay that ſome Lands have been ſtole from you, and ſold by ſome <hi>Indians,</hi> who have no Right to them, to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who have ſettled upon them. I know of no Lands lying within this Province, which have not been purchaſed of you, that have been ſettled by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> except a Tract lying on or near the River <hi>Delaware,</hi> about Fifty Miles above the <hi>Blue Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</hi> Brethren, I am glad to have this Opportunity of ſpeaking to you on this Head: It is a Matter of great Conſequence, and has given me much Concern; liſten attentively, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to what I ſhall ſay to you about this Matter. — You know that an Agreement was made, a great While ago, between your Anceſtors and your Brother <hi>Onas</hi> (which has been often renewed and confirmed by many of your Chiefs now living) that your Brother <hi>Onas</hi> would never ſettle any Lands in this Province, till he had fairly purchaſed them of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who engaged that they would never ſell any Lands in this Province to any other Perſon than their Brother <hi>Onas.</hi> That you may refreſh your Memories, and call to Mind this Agreement. I give you this Belt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Belt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great Number of People who lived in <hi>Connecticut</hi> Government, came about a Year ago and ſettled near this River, beyond the Line of the Lands purchaſed of you, at a Place called <hi>Cuſhietunck</hi> and claimed all the Lands from thence quite up to <hi>Wyoming.</hi> As ſoon as heard
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008887_0012_10308F40D14A8F38"/>of it I ſent Meſſengers to them, informing them theſe Lands had never been purchaſed of the <hi>Indians,</hi> and deſiring them to remove away. They ſent me back, for Anſwer, that they had purchaſed all thoſe Lands of you, and under that Pretence had a Right to them, and would hold them. Now, Brethren, as you have told me you will hide nothing from me, I deſire you will tell me truly, whether you have ſold theſe Lands to theſe Strangers, who have ſettled them, againſt my Will and Conſent? — (To which Queſtion the <hi>Six Nations</hi> made Anſwer, That thoſe were the Lands which they mentioned Yeſterday to have been ſold by four ſtraggling <hi>Indians,</hi> without the Knowledge or Conſent of their General Council, and that they underſtood <hi>Thomas King,</hi> an <hi>Oneida Indian,</hi> was one of thoſe who had ſold thoſe Lands.)</p>
            <p>Upon which Anſwer the Governor ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know all ſuch private Sales are of no Force. I therefore join this String to the Belt, and deſire you will ſend for thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> into the Great Council at <hi>Onondagoe,</hi> and reprove them for their Conduct, and cancel their Deeds.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Belt and a large String.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already, by the Conſent of my Wiſe Men, ſet up two great Stores, or Trading-houſes, to furniſh the <hi>Indians</hi> with all Sorts of Goods, at a cheap Rate, one at <hi>Pittſburgh,</hi> and the other at <hi>Shamokin;</hi> at the laſt of which Places you may eaſily ſupply yourſelves with whatever you want. The Expences, Loſſes, and many Difficulties which attend our ſending Goods to theſe two Places, are ſo great, that I cannot ſet up another Store-houſe at ſo great a Diſtance as <hi>Diahoga,</hi> according to your Deſire. — I am ſorry to refuſe you any Thing; but if I ſhould agree with you, to do more than I can perform, you would have juſt Reaſon to charge me with deceiving you. You muſt not therefore take it amiſs, that I always ſpeak plainly to you, and tell you my Mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Belt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told you before, that if I ſhould have Occaſion to ſend you any Meſſages, I would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the care of them to Meſſengers of my own; and as <hi>Samuel Weiſer</hi> is a Perſon recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by you for that Purpoſe, I will uſe him for the future.</p>

               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am pleaſed to hear you ſent to General <hi>Johnſon</hi> our Fleſh and Blood, who were Priſoners among the <hi>Cayugas.</hi> We eſteem it as the ſtrongeſt Proof of your Friendſhip that you can poſſibly give us. — You all agreed, at the Treaty held here three Years ago, that you would ſearch all the Towns and Places in the <hi>Indian</hi> Countries for them, and deliver them up to us, without leaving one behind; and that if they had gone down your Throats, you would heave them up again. I am ſorry that but very few have yet been brought back, though I know there are a great many ſcattered up and down among the <hi>Indians.</hi> We cannot help thinking that you ſpeak only from your Lips, and not from your Hearts, whatever Profeſſions of Regard you make for us, till this Promiſe is performed, and we ſee our Fathers, Mothers and Children, who have been carried into Captivity, reſtored to us, this Promiſe was the Condition on which the Peace Belt was exchanged between us. — Some among you have been faithful, and ſent back all the Priſoners they had; I do not therefore addreſs this Part of my Speech to them, but take them to my Heart; it is intended only for ſuch of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> as have deceived us, and ſtill detain our Fleſh and Blood. I ſincerely wiſh to be Friends with you all, and therefore once more put you in Mind of your Engagements, and inſist on your immediately complying with them, by reſtoring the Priſoners, that nothing may remain to make any Difference between us to the End of Time.</p>

               <hi>Brother,</hi>

            <p>Agreeable to your Requeſt, I have taken into ſerious Conſideration what you ſaid to me on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> laſt, and ſhall anſwer you with the ſame good Will and Sincerity that true Friends always uſe to one another.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I readily acknowledge that you have been a great Inſtrument in bringing about the great Work of Peace; and, according to the Promiſes you made us at this Place three Years ago, the Peace Belt has been ſent to ſeveral Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> who have ſince joined their Hands to it; ſo that, by the Bleſſing of the Moſt High, the Wound, by the Means of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine you have applied, is intirely healed. And it ſhall be my Endeavour, as you ſay it ſhall be yours, to keep the Wound from ever opening again.</p>

            <p>You tell me that all your young Men as far as the <hi>Twightwees,</hi> and thoſe now with you, <hi>Mohickons, Opies</hi> and <hi>Delawares,</hi> intend to join in, and ſtand to, whatever you and I have agreed to; and that they will not take Notice of whatever Drops of Blood may have ſtained the Road, but will look ſteadily to our Agreement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I very much commend this Reſolution; — it is a Mark of Prudence and real Love for Peace; conſidering how many wicked Men there are in the World, it muſt be expected that private Miſchiefs, and even Murders, will now and then be committed: When this happens, we ſhall do well to let one another know of it, and join in taking all proper Meaſures to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and puniſh the evil Doers. This being done, the public Peace can never be affected or hart. — By this Belt I aſſure you that this is my Diſpoſition and Reſolution, as well as it is yours.</p>

            <p>I am now to inform you, that ſince our laſt Meeting at this Place, three Years ago, the Road has been ſtained with a few Drops of Blood. The firſt Thing of this Kind happened over <hi>Suſquehanna,</hi> where one <hi>Indian</hi> Man, his Wife, and two Children were found dead, having been either murdered or drowned in the River <hi>Conedogwainet.</hi> It no ſooner came to my Knowledge, but I iſſued a Proclamation, offering <hi>Two Hundred and Sixty-ſix Dollars,</hi> as a Reward for detecting and apprehending all ſuch as ſhould be concerned in this Murder: but, notwithſtanding all my Endeavours, nothing certain has yet been diſcovered.</p>
            <p>About two Months ago, our very <hi>good</hi> Friend <hi>Thomas Hickman</hi> was found ſhot in the <hi>Tuſcarora Path Valley.</hi> One Perſon is now in Goal, on Suſpicion; two others were put into Priſon, but ſet at Liberty again, at the Inſtance of the <hi>Indians,</hi> it appearing to them that they were innocent.

               <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> then informed the Governor, that he deſired to ſpeak a few Words to him, and to his Uncles the <hi>Six Nations;</hi> whereupon the Governor deſired him to begin, and he ſpoke as follows.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I beg you will hearken to what I am going to ſay. You may remember, ſome Years ago, at our Council Fire, you took me by the Hairs of my Head, and ſhook me, and told me to go and live at <hi>Wyoming,</hi> for you gave me the Land there, where I might raiſe my Bread, and get my Living; now again you deſire me to move off from thence, and would place me ſomewhere elſe.

<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008887_0015_10308F4B328D7F70"/>about. It was left to King GEORGE. You told me as ſoon as ever you heard from the King, you would let me know of it; but I have not heard you ſay any thing about it ſince: Now, Brother, as there are ſome here preſent, who have never been paid for ſome of their Lands, we deſire you would pay them now: but as for the <hi>Munſies,</hi> and ſome others at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legheny,</hi> who alſo claim Lands near this Place, they will agree with you when they ſee you.</p>
            <p>The Governor replied, that he would take into Conſideration what he had ſaid, and would anſwer him in the Morning.</p>
            <p>Being aſked what Lands he deſired to be paid for; he anſwered, that the Lands are where we now ſtand, betwixt the Mountains and <hi>Tohicon Creek,</hi> but acknowledged that ſome Lands about <hi>Durbam,</hi> four Miles ſquare, were paid for.</p>
            <p>Tokahaio <hi>then ſtood up and ſpoke.</hi>

               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We the <hi>Seven Nations,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Nanticokes</hi> and <hi>Conoys,</hi> ſpeak to you. — About ſeven Years ago we went down to <hi>Maryland,</hi> with a Belt of Wampum, to fetch our Fleſh and Blood, which we ſhewed to ſome <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> there, who told us they did not underſtand Belts, but if we had brought any Order in Writing from the Governor of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> they would let our Fleſh and Blood then come away with us; but as this was not done, they would not let them come: — Now we deſire you would give us an Order for that Purpoſe.</p>

            <p>We would have you make ſome Satisfaction to our Couſins here, the <hi>Delawares,</hi> for their Lands, as we ſuppoſe they deſire it. — Some of them are now preſent, who claim ſome Lands here, and are often thinking of it, particularly one (pointing to <hi>Joſeph Pepy</hi>)</p>

            <p>My old Mother and Children, who are here at preſent, are not able to walk, I deſire therefore that my Brother would help me to a Horſe, as I have a great Way to go Home, and cannot make a Canoe at this Time of the Year.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the Lands lying between the <hi>Kittochtinny Hills</hi> and <hi>Touhickon Creek,</hi> which you ſay you have never been paid for, you know the Proprietaries of this Province have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inſiſted that they were fairly purchaſed of the <hi>Delawares,</hi> before you were born, who received the Conſideration Money for them; you know alſo that the Diſpute between you and the Proprietaries about theſe Lands was, by your own particular Deſire, referred to our Great King over the Water, who, from his Love of Juſtice, and Regard to you, has taken upon himſelf to ſettle it, and has ordered General <hi>Johnſon</hi> to hear your Complaint, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Truth of it, and make Report to him, that he may direct what is right to be done; of this General <hi>Johnſon</hi> gave you Notice, by a Letter, above a Year and an Half ago, and deſired you to appoint a proper Time and Place to meet him on this Occaſion, that the Affair might be ſpeedily ſettled. I have waited ever ſince in Expectation that you would comply with General <hi>Johnſon's</hi> Requeſt; and I now inform you that I am, and at all Times ſhall be, ready, on my Part, to ſend the Proprietary Commiſſioners to ſupport their Claim, whenever you ſhall appoint the Time and Place of Meeting; it is therefore your own Fault if the Matter is delayed any longer.</p>
            <p>Addreſſing himſelf to the <hi>Seven Nations,</hi> be ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brothren of the</hi> Seven United Nations,</p>
            <p>I have conſidered what you ſaid to me on Behalf of the Conoys and the <hi>Nanticokes,</hi> who have ſome of their Brethren ſtill remaining in the Province of <hi>Maryland:</hi> As I am not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of that Province, I have no Power to order the People there to ſuffer their Relations to come away; I will, however, afford them all the Aſſiſtance I can, and will not only give the Meſſenger they ſend to <hi>Maryland</hi> a Paſſport, or ſafe Conduct, but will write to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and requeſt him to permit their Brethren to come away, without Interruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You deſire me to make Satisfaction to your Couſins the <hi>Delawares</hi> for theſe Lands which they claim, as they often think of it; had you known, as well as I do, how groundleſs and unjuſt this Claim of theirs was, I am ſure you would not have taken any Notice of it. Your old Men muſt remember, that at a full Council held with the <hi>Six Nations,</hi> at <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> in the Year 1742, the Claim the <hi>Delawares</hi> now make for theſe very Lands was laid before them, and the Deeds from them to the Proprietaries peruſed and conſidered by the <hi>Six Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> who, upon a full Hearing of the Matter, then were convinced that the Proprietaries had fairly purchaſed them of the <hi>Delawares,</hi> and paid for them. Whereupon the <hi>Six Nations</hi> ordered the <hi>Delawares</hi> to remove off from them, and go to <hi>Wyoming,</hi> which they accordingly did. <hi>Teedyuſcung,</hi> ſome Time ago, referred his Complaint about theſe Lands to our Great King, who has ordered General <hi>Johnſon</hi> to enquire into the whole Matter, and let him know how it is circumſtanced, that Juſtice may be done as well to the <hi>Delawares</hi> as to us; and I am ready to ſend my Commiſſioners to General <hi>Johnſon,</hi> to lay before him the Proprietaries Deeds for, and Right to, theſe Lands, whenever <hi>Teedyuſcung</hi> will appoint a Time and Place for this Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tokahaio</hi> addreſſed the Governor, in Behalf of the <hi>Tuteloes,</hi> as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We deſire our Brother will be ſo good as to furniſh us with three Waggons, to carry home our Sick, who are not able to walk, as we intend to go home as ſoon as we can; — which Requeſt the Governor granted, and left the Number of Waggons to be provided for them, to the Direction of <hi>Joſeph Fox,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>Tokahaio <hi>then added,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother</hi> Onas,</p>
            <p>We have been here at this Council Fire, and heard what good Word you have ſpoke to We have no more to ſay at preſent, and we ſee likewiſe that you have nothing more to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008887_0017_10308F4FCCC8ACB0"/>ſay to us; we are therefore going to part. When we return home, we will acquaint all our People with what we have heard. We heartily thank you for the good Uſage we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you.</p>
            <p>The Governor informed them that he had brought up with him a Preſent from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to them, which Mr. Fox would diſtribute amongſt them To-morrow; and then concluded the Treaty, by ſhaking Hands with the Chiefs of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Afternoon the Governor and his Company ſet out for <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
