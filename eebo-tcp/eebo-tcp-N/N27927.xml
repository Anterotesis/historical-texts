            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>DAVID, after he had ſerved his own generation, fell on ſleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and ſaw corruption.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words of St. PAUL, afford us a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious view of DAVID's life and death:—but you will not expect me to trace the fooſteps of this great character from the ſheepfold to his exit. The inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of his life are too numerous and complicate to admit the attempt.—The ſetting ſun would leave the narration unfiniſhed. A few obſervations, therefore, conſiſtent with the text, muſt ſuffice</p>
            <p>LET it be obſerved, that DAVID <hi>ſerved</hi> his own generation. By this it is apparent, that he was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a generous, a noble ſoul.—Unlike thoſe, who fondly ſtyle themſelves excluſive patriots at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, he proved by a ſucceſſion of great actions, that "ſelf love and ſocial are the ſame." As a king, the welfare of his ſubjects was the main-ſpring of his movements; as a good man, the love of GOD.—Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the greateſt in Iſrael, he became "a ſervant to them all."</p>
            <p>HE was active as light in oppoſing their enemies, courageous in defending their rights, and ſincere in
<pb facs="unknown:037200_0004_100D3A7B2146B128"/>
his joy, when their happineſs was the reſult of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions. His conduct was always preciſely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the exigencies of the times.</p>
            <p>AS the ſoul of the body politic, he felt himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſtrongeſt obligations to give it animation and vigor.—Hence that amazing application of all his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to the encouragement of his ſubjects, in any new and hazardous enterprize, which is ſo evident in every page of his hiſtory. In battle he often oppoſed himſelf to the firſt onſet of his enemies.—He diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the idea of fending his troops on a forlorn hope, while he himſelf was ſafe;—witneſs his words to them when they were juſt going out to quell the rebels under ABSALOM;—"I will ſurely go forth with you myſelf alſo."—Witneſs the anſwer of the people, who well knew his generous ſoul would have urged him to ſhare all their dangers:—"Thou ſhall not go forth; for if <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; but now thou art worth ten thouſand of us; now, therefore, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that thou ſuccour us out of the city."—Witneſs his refuſing to drink the water, which three of his mighty men had brought him from the well in Bethlehem, after puſhing themſelves through a hoſt of Philiſtines in order to obtain it.—He had been longing for it; but a recollection of the dangers, to which his faithful ſervants had expoſed themſelves, prevented him from ſlaking his thirſt.—His feelings were too ſtrong to be
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037200_0005_100D3A7E0544BD58"/>
expreſſed but by pouring it on the ground.—"Be it far from me, O Lord, that I ſhould do this.—Is not this the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?"</p>
            <p>WHAT but the blackeſt ingratitude could dictate a revolt from ſuch a king?—What, but a heart, hard as the nether mill-ſtone could withhold its love?—What but a total extinction of humanity, could have promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an ABSALOM to turn his arms againſt the beſt of fathers?—To what exceſs of grief muſt ſuch unnatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conduct have reduced an indulgent parent? Grief did not, however, divert his mind from his darling object, the felicity of his ſubjects. So ſteady is virtue, when the handmaid to knowledge.</p>
            <p>THE good king was well apprized of the horrors of anarchy, and could duly appreciate the bleſſings of peace and regularity. Let rulers aim at the intereſts of their ſubjects and conſtituents, and they will ſecure their own. Were they conſcientiouſly to exchange one word in their political dictionary for another; or rather, would they conſider the word <hi>Rule,</hi> as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviation of the word <hi>Service,</hi> the people would not ſo often cenſure their diction, nor criminate their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. "DAVID <hi>ſerved</hi> his own generation."</p>
            <p>THIS is true of him in many reſpects. He not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led them to frequent victory over their enemies, and the enemies of God—laid ſeveral nations under
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037200_0006_100D3A7FCB104A68"/>
tribute—increaſed his revenues—lightened the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens of his ſubjects, and preſerved order at home;— but he adjuſted the affairs of his kingdom, both civil and military in the moſt beneficial manner poſſible.— He ordered a ſtanding militia, conſiſting of 288,000 men, to ſerve alternately in a body of 24,000 each month. In addition to all this, he frequently incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated on the minds of his people the firſt principles of religion, and did, indeed, write much for their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>JUST before he died he left a model of the Temple, which was afterwards built by SOLOMON; and ſhone as the brighteſt ornament of that nation. It is ſaid, that he had reſerved 46,000 tons of gold, and many other materials, amaſſed by conqueſt, and laid aſide by the hand of a rigorous economy, for the building of that maſter-piece of architecture.</p>
            <p>IN <hi>all</hi> theſe articles he ſerved his own genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the <hi>laſt,</hi> his ſervice looked beyond the then preſent people. Let it not be unnoticed in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of his hiſtory, that he "acted by the will of God." Providence raiſed him up and qualified him for the important ſtation on which he reflected ſo much honor. It was the will of heaven, that he ſhould reign over Iſrael, and "the inſpiration of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gave him an underſtanding" proper to direct him in the diſcharge of the arduous duties attached to Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. Infinite wiſdom will not ſend one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037200_0007_100D3A8169E259E0"/>
into a field of difficulties, and not arm him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. He will not ſuffer a poor, dependant creature to fight the battles of the Lord at his own charges. If "by him kings reign, and princes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree juſtice," by him alſo they are endowed with quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications adapted to their offices.</p>
            <p>IF "by the will of God" be meant <hi>according</hi> to that will, then DAVID may be ſaid to have faithfully ſerved GOD by ſerving his generation. There is no doubt of the fact. He is denominated a ſervant of GOD through a great part of the old Scriptures. He was eminently ſuch. It ſhould be the great aim of all rulers to diſcover the mind of GOD, and to make it the grand criterion of all their adminiſtrations. Were this univerſally the caſe, the ruled would univerſally rejoice. All thoſe miſerable jealouſies, which diſturb the peace and mar the happineſs of civil ſociety, would want a name. Nay, I know not, in ſuch an event, whether ſubjects would not rather move in their own humble ſphere, than take the pious cares and anxieties off their ſhoulders who hold the reigns of government. The higheſt diſtinction between a godly ruler and his conſtituents, is, that HE ſupports the heavieſt burthen. Unenvied poſt of honor in the view of every conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate mind! MOSES bitterly complained of the cares impoſed on him. He found it difficult indeed to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his arms a whole people, as a father carrieth his children.—He felt as a father to them; but they were
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037200_0008_100D3A83A2CB7C68"/>
too numerous for the attention of a ſingle man. The cares of public life are great aſſiſtants to time in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man to his long home. "DAVID fell on ſleep and was laid unto his fathers."</p>
            <p>IT would be trite here to obſerve, that death pays no reſpect to perſons; that kings and peaſants muſt lie down in the grave together; or that titles, diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and honors form no barrier againſt the great leveller of life. We would only take notice, that death is called a ſleep, and obſerve, that to him who has la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored ſtrenuouſly in the ſervice of GOD and his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, this "ſleep is ſweet." To throw off all our mortal habiliments at the cloſe of our days muſt be pleaſant, if we have worn them uſefully. They are peculiarly cumberſome to <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi>; they therefore, muſt find <hi>peculiar</hi> ſatisfaction in being "un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed," eſpecially, if they have good reaſon to hope for the garment "of immortality."—They may then exult in the cheering idea of exchanging corruption for incorruption; of laying down an earthly diadem, and taking up a crown of glory. If for a time they ſee corruption in their bodies, their ſpirits wear a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er form beyond its corroding power.—If they ſleep awhile, they are ſure to be awakened to ſee with infinite ſatisfaction "the morning of the reſurrection."</p>
            <p>THIS is all applicable to DAVID. Nor is it leſs ſo to the illuſtrious WASHINGTON;—"the firſt in <hi>war,</hi> the firſt in <hi>peace,</hi> and the firſt in the hearts of a great people."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037200_0009_100D3A872718C618"/>To give you his juſt character, would be to partake in ſome meaſure of its glory—an honor to which I dare not aſpire. To ſay that he was born Feb. 11th O. S. 1732, became commander in chief of the armies of America in 1775—that he reſigned that important, but well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged truſt in 1783—was unanimouſly choſen Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the United States of America in 1789—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the Preſidency in 1796—accepted the command of the armies of the United States again in 1798—and that he died December 14th 1799, would be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what you have long ſince heard. Farther ſtill would it be from propriety to follow him through the field of carnage, and fix the dates of his battles and his ſucceſſes. Suffer me, however, to ſketch ſome few traits in his military, civil, and domeſtic character.</p>
            <p>HE began early to "ſerve his generation by the will of GOD." His dawn was brilliant, and if not warm and influential, it waited only for time to throw his fellow-men beneath his more vertical rays.—Nor were they long in waiting—the ſtory of a BRADDOCK will ſanction the obſervation. In that we may ſee his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary counſel fatally diſregarded, to the diminution of that haughty Briton's fame. There alſo may be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bud of warlike promiſe opening at the firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial touch of occaſion. There we might have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, with no prophetic eye, the wreaths of honor, which time was weaving for our youthful hero. The era, deſtined for the full diſplay of them, was not
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037200_0010_100D2E5805F37BB8"/>
known. The eye of a JACOB might, however, have pierced through future years, and led him to predict the ſame things of our national deliverer, in ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, as of JUDAH.—"JUDAH is a lion's whelp, gone up from the prey." He might have deſcribed him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards as a "lion Couchant, not Rampant"—as one who did not love war for its own ſake, but who fought for peace, that he might enjoy without moleſtation, what his ſtrength and courage had fairly won.</p>
            <p>THIS character was completely exhibited by the man, the warrior, whoſe removal we now lament.— That ambition, which, by its madneſs and cruelty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns many of its votaries to "everlaſting fame," found no place in his capacious mind. He fought for the birthright of his countrymen, <hi>Liberty.</hi>—He ſtruggled againſt a powerful, and a haughty foe, who was determined to wreſt from us that invaluable gift of heaven. The hidden lightning of his ſpirit flaſhed in the face of an oppoſing cloud, but could never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote an equilibrium. The balance was in his favor. Victory marched by his ſide in the cauſe divine, and thus became worthy of her name. Apparent inaction in HIM was ſometimes of actions the greateſt. It has been well obſerved of him, that his delay was conqueſt. His policy was truly FABIAN, and therefore the beſt poſſible for his country, raw and undiſciplined as were its troops. He well knew that "tide in human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune."—

That tide began to flow, when war with an imperious aggreſſor firſt dreſſed our hero in a ſuit of freedom, and bade him repreſent the nation. He wore it with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible firmneſs and unalterable dignity, till he could preſent each of his fellow-countrymen with the ſame glorious robe. Having ſecured the grand object of his exertions, he retired from the tented field to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Mount, richly laden with the evergreens of fame, there to drink the pure breath of peace, there to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge a highly dignified leiſure.—This boon he was not long to enjoy.</p>
            <p>As he had deſcended from the greateſt circle ever deſcribed by one luminary in the atmoſphere of man, ſo the mere voluntary twilight of his radience ſtill held the admiring eye of the nation.</p>
            <p>HIS country ſoon again demanded in the language of humble neceſſity, the full blaze of his genius. Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion kindled his benevolent ſpirit, and he majeſtical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered the demand.</p>
            <p>THE old confederation upon a ſlight ſurvey was found totally inadequate to the purpoſes of maintaining har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and order, or of concentrating the intereſts of the American States. The experience and diſcernment of a WASHINGTON, were importunately requeſted and freely granted. In the fabrication of the Conſtitution under which we now live, he was a prime agent.—His penetration was the teleſcope, through which an auguſt

body of Stateſmen and Patriots deigned to look for the remoteſt conſequences of its articles. No wonder, then, that he was embraced by the nation at large in the choice of a Preſident.</p>
            <p>THE firmneſs, the dignity, the enlightened pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, which he exhibited in the diſcharge of his weighty Preſidential duties, have been ſo thoroughly experienced, as to leave our encomiums in the rear of his worth. He was the central fixed ſtar in the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſphere, around which revolved many bright, though inferior lights. In him were united both the powers of attraction and repulſion. His dignity ſuffered none of his train rudely to approximate within the line of decent diſtance; while his alluring excellence drew them into the focus of his benignity. Whoever once ſaw his mere exterior muſt have wiſhed to unlock the caſket which contained a brilliant of the firſt water.— Vain, however, is an attempt fully to portray a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter like his. We want thoſe ſhades, by which we readily diſcern the ſemblances of common men.— The cardinal virtues muſt ſit for their likeneſſes, to give the world the great Contour of his moral coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and virtues of a lower claſs muſt fill the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the picture.</p>
            <p>LET us not forget, that he was confeſſedly a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Chriſt, and as ſuch "wreſtled not only againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037200_0013_100D3A9023151828"/>
and the rulers of the darkneſs of this world alſo. He took much of the "armour of God"—"His loins were girt about with truth, and his breaſt-plate was righteouſneſs."—"His feet were ſhod with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the goſpel of peace," and this rendered his journey through a thorny world more ſafe and eaſy. <hi>Faith</hi> was his <hi>ſhield</hi> and the hope of ſavation his <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met.</hi> Thus he was enabled "to quench the fiery darts of the wicked, and having done all, to ſtand."</p>
            <p>AFTER having ornamented, yea, highly dignified the Cabinet, put faction to the bluſh, laid his cool hand on the diſtracted pulſe of anarchy and rebellion, and reduced it to the moderate vibration of health, he once more nobly relinquiſhed his glorious ſtation, and returned to his beloved Vernon, to diſcharge the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and taſte the pleaſures of private, domeſtic life.— Here he was the kind huſband, the feeling maſter, and the benevolent neighbor.—Like the worthies of the old Teſtament, he was Prophet, Prieſt, and King in his own family. With him ſlavery forgot her chains, and his houſehold was peace and love. The acme of his perfection however, was not fully attained, till he complied with the invitation once more to become the bulwark of his country.—Glorious ſacrifice of the calm hours of the evening of life! Too exalted a conduct to admit a parallel!—When did the almond flouriſh with ſuch ennobled beauty? Hiſtory is ſilent, and ſilent will remain, perhaps, forever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037200_0014_100D3A91B5A58540"/>IMPIOUS. France dared not to declare open hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but ſaid to herſelf the "old Lion is couched down, who ſhall dare to rouſe him?"</p>
            <p>HERE we pauſe!—Regret for his loſs ſucceeds to the pleaſure of recounting the deeds of his important life!—Yet let us not cruelly wiſh his return, while we believe his Vernon was but a ſtep-ſtone to mount Zion.—Like Sampſon, he ſlew more at his death, than in his life; ſince even the numerous children of Envy we laid aſleep. Envy herſelf ſtops at his grave, and pronounces his eulogy.</p>
            <p>WHILE we ſincerely lament his departure, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that God, <hi>with whom is the reſidue</hi> of the ſpirit, can qualify others to fill every important ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the field and in the cabinet, and enable them to "ſerve their generation according to his will." Let us pray that he would impart the ſpirit of our much regretted friend to our worthy PRESIDENT, and make the ſubordinate officers in civil truſt, as angels of God to this people. May we all be enabled to ſerve <hi>our</hi> generation according to the will of heaven, that we may "be laid to our fathers in peace."</p>
