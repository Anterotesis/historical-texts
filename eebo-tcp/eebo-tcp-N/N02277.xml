            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If we look back to the preceeding Chapter, we ſhall find a heavy Charge drawn up againſt a Profeſſing People of GOD, as an Evidence of their woful Apoſtacy

and Declenſion: Yea their Caſe is repreſented as if there was ſcarce a Godly Man to be found among them all. Ver.I. <hi>Run ye to and fro through the Streets of Jeruſalem, and ſee now and know, and ſeek in the Broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth Judgment, that ſeeketh the Truth, and I will pardon it.</hi> A <hi>ſad Caſe</hi> truly, if there were not one ſuch to be found. <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> would then be worſe than <hi>Sodom</hi> that was deſtroyed by Fire from Heaven, for even there a Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was found. But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Words are to be taken not abſolutely, but in a comparative ſenſe, to denote the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godly there, and the general Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption reigning among all Ranks and Orders of Men. More particularly, they are Articled againſt for their <hi>falſe ſwearing, their Incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibleneſs under the Judgments of God, their Idolatry and Adultery, their contempt of God's Word and Prophets, together with their criminal regardleſsneſs of him whoſe Power is great, and for which he is to be feared, their Deceit, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice &amp; Violence, and delight in falſe Prophets.</hi> The <hi>Prophets propheſy falſely, and the Prieſts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it ſo.</hi> And in the midſt of theſe Charges we have once and again ſuch ſharp Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, as one would think ſhould have awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and wounded them. <hi>How ſhall I Pardon thee for this? Shall I not viſit for theſe things? ſaith the Lord: and ſhall not my ſoul be aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on ſuch a nation as this? Hear ye not me?
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002709_0006_0FE60FFB28BCD540"/>
ſaith the Lord: Will ye not tremble at my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? And again, Shall I not viſit for theſe things? ſaith the Lord: Shall not my ſoul be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi> In this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therefore we find a juſtly offended GOD giving a Commiſſion to the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of His People, to go up againſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them for their very great Wickedneſs: which Commiſſion, with the ground and reaſon of it, we have opened, Ver. 6, 7. <hi>Thus hath the Lord of Hoſts ſaid, Hew ye down Trees, and caſt amount againſt Jeruſalem: this is the City to be viſited, ſhe is wholly oppreſſion in the midſt of her. As a Fountain caſteth out her waters, ſo ſhe caſteth out her wickedneſs: Violence and ſpoil is heard in her, before me continually is grief and wounds.</hi> Thus is <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and threatned. Nevertheleſs, ſuch are the Compaſſions of a Merciful GOD, that before he brings the threatned Ruin upon a ſinful People, he will give them warning and adviſe them of their Danger; that they may Repent of their wickedneſs, and thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the evil coming upon them, which he threatens to do unto them.</p>

               <q>By the Correction thou haſt felt already, and which is further threatned, Be perſwaded to Repentance before it be too late.</q> Let the Rod and Reproof teach thee Wiſdom. Nor were they at any loſs what to do in this
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002709_0007_0FE5F2F5B20AEDA8"/>
Caſe, being well enough acquainted with what GOD tells them by this Prophet, Chap. 18.7, 8. <hi>At what Inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down and to deſtroy it: If that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>LEST my Soul depart from thee</hi>; or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Marginal Reading of our Bibles, be <hi>looſed</hi> or <hi>disjointed</hi> from thee: which doubtleſs, as our Engliſh Annotatours obſerve, <q>is a Metaphor taken from the Dislocation of a Limb, the looſing it from it's natural Place and Poſture, and putting it, as we ſay, <hi>out of Joynt</hi>: intimating what a Pain and Grief it is to GOD to leave or caſt off a People, whom he hath taken into Covenant with himſelf, and with how much difficulty he is drawn thereunto.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>LEST I make thee Deſolate, a Land not Inhabited.</hi> Leſt I both caſt thee off, and cut thee off. So that the Exhortation is grounded upon the moſt Important and weighty Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations Imaginable.</p>
            <p>THERE are Four Doctrines I ſhall offer you and briefly ſpeak to from the Words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> I. THAT the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple conſiſts in having the <hi>Gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of GOD with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002709_0008_0FE610239635FD48"/>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> II. THAT GOD is not ſo engaged to any People, but that upon Juſt Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation given him, his <hi>Soul</hi> may <hi>Depart</hi> from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> III. THAT the <hi>Departure of GOD</hi> from a People, opens a Door for <hi>Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Judgments</hi> to enter in upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> IV. THAT it is both the <hi>Duty &amp; Intereſt</hi> of a People, to do all that in them lies, to prevent ſo great a Calamity, as the Departure of GOD's Soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them will certainly carry in it.</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>I.</hi> THAT <hi>the happineſs of a People conſiſts in having the gracious</hi> Preſence <hi>of GOD with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Doctrine, tho' not expreſs'd, is yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implied in the Words. For if the Departure of GOD from a People be threatned as the ſoreſt Judgment that can befal them, and they be earneſtly called upon to uſe their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to prevent it, then nothing can be more plain than that his gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them is their Happineſs and Glory.</p>
            <p>AND this is a Truth very eaſily proved and evidenced. It is not the Confluence of all the Bleſſings of Providence, the abounding of Peace. Plenty, and every other common Mercy deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that does ſo denominate a People Happy, as the having <hi>GOD with them</hi>; whoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is <hi>All in All</hi> to their <hi>Felicity</hi>: Their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002709_0009_0FE60FDE2C95E8F0"/>
               <hi>Decus ac Tutamen</hi>; their Ornament and Safety, their Defence and Glory. This is the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive Sum of all GOD's gracious Promiſes to his People, as he told <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Chap. 1.5. <hi>I will be with thee: I will not ſail thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Yea we find the Phraſe ſometimes uſed as expreſſive of all the Good that need to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted for. Thus by Pious <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 28.20. <hi>If God will be with we, and will keep me in the way that I go.</hi> What Benediction can be more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> than that, <hi>The Great G0D be with</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. Every Bleſſing is included in ſuch a Wiſh. Thus <hi>Boaz</hi> came from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and ſaid unto his Reapers, <hi>The Lord be with you</hi>: And they to be even with him in Bleſſing, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>The Lord bleſs thee,</hi> Ruth 2.4. With this alſo we find good old <hi>Iſrael</hi> comforting his Sons a little before his Death; Gen. 48.21. And Iſrael ſaid, Behold I die: but <hi>G0D ſhall be with you.</hi> So that the beſt thing which GOD can Promiſe, or we can deſire, either for our ſelves or others, is, <hi>That GOD will be with us and them.</hi> Agreable whereto is that Prayer of <hi>Solomon,</hi> at the Dedication of the Temple, I. Kings 8.57 <hi>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers: let him not leave us, nor forſake us.</hi> If the Divine Preſence be once obtained, all other Bleſſings both Temporal and Spiritual will be conſequent thereupon.</p>
            <p>Particularly,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IF GOD be with a People,</hi> he will favour them with all that <hi>Guidance, Conduct and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> that they need. It is one Character given;

For the Lord God is a <hi>Sun.</hi> And when he is thus ſtiled in reference to his People, it denotes that he will afford them all that <hi>Light &amp; Direction,</hi> which their <hi>Darkneſs</hi> &amp; <hi>Difficulties</hi> may render need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them: That he will inſtruct and teach them in the way which they ſhould go, and guide them with his eye; that when their way is hedg'd up with thorns, and their Perplexities ſuch that they know not what to do, he will acquaint them with their Duty, and make their way plain before them.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>GOD's Preſence</hi> with a People ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that he will both <hi>Support under, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate them out of their Difficulties</hi>: That his Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs ſhall be ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concern'd and employ'd for them; that he will be to them a preſent help in every time of trouble to ſupport them under their Burdens; yea that in the mount of their Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties he will be ſeen, working Deliverance and Salvation for them. And O that in theſe reſpects there were more viſible tokens of GOD's <hi>Gracious Preſence</hi> with this People!</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>GOD's being</hi> with a People implies his <hi>Proſpering and giving Succeſs to all their lawful Undertakings.</hi> We read concerning <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.23. <hi>The Lord was with him: and that which he did, the lord made it to proſper.</hi> And of <hi>Uzziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.5. <hi>That as long as he ſought the Lord, God made him to proſper.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002709_0011_0FE60FE0C3437AD0"/>
The Succeſs of all endeavours is from the Lord alone, and if a People once engage the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of GOD with them, they may be aſſured of all kind of Proſperity. Salvation then will in every reſpect be nigh unto them, and Glory dwell in the Land.</p>
            <p>I might further have ſaid, That where <hi>GOD is preſent with a People,</hi> he will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings</hi> alſo upon them. He will be <hi>graciouſly preſent</hi> with his <hi>own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> and give abundant Succeſs to the Means of Grace. He will <hi>pour his Spirit upon the Seed</hi> of his People, <hi>and his bleſſing upon their Offspring</hi>: Yea ſuch ſhall be the remarkable ſmiles of Heaven upon them, that all ſhall take Notice, That they are <hi>a People whom the Lord hath Bleſſed.</hi> This and much more than this is implied in the <hi>Preſence of GOD</hi> with a People; and if ſo, we may well draw up the Pſalmiſts's Concluſion, Pſal. 144, ult. <hi>Happy is the People that is in ſuch a caſe: yea, Happy is that People whoſe God is the Lord.</hi> And may I not ſay, that GOD is thus with a People, and will continue to be ſo as long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Faithful to him? 2 Chron. 15.2. <hi>Hear ye me, Aſa, and all Judah and Benjamin.

            <p>DOCT, II <hi>THAT GOD is not ſo </hi>enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged<hi> to any People, but that upon juſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation given him, his Soul may</hi> depart <hi>from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE People of the <hi>Jews</hi> were once the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Profeſſing People that GOD had in the World; a People whom he choſe to himſelf above all People that were upon the Face of the Earth, and upon whom he beſtowed ſpecial Marks of his Favour. Nevertheleſs theſe he warns, to take Care leſt by their unſuitable Carriage they ſhould provoke him to abandon and caſt them off; left his <hi>Soul</hi> ſhould depart from them: Which Phraſe imports not only his ſuſpending the former manifeſtations of his Love; but even his utter loathing and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of them.</p>
            <p>For clearing this, I ſhall</p>
            <p n="1">I. SHOW <hi>when</hi> a People may be ſaid to <hi>provoke</hi> GOD to depart from them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THAT upon ſuch Provocation given, <hi>his Soul may depart</hi> from them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to ſhow <hi>when a People may be ſaid to provoke G0D to depart from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND altho' it be true that all Sins are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to GOD, and what his Soul hates you
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002709_0013_0FE60FE0D045B5E0"/>
there are ſome particular Evils which are more provoking, and have a more direct tendency to cauſe him to depart. I'll Inſtance here only in a few of them; and hint at ſome others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>Low Eſteem of the Preſence of GOD with a People,</hi> will be a juſt Provocation to him to depart from them. If that which is the higheſt Favour of GOD to a People be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued and meanly accounted of by them, how Juſt muſt it be with him to take the ſame from them, that they may learn to know the worth of it by the want thereof? What Perſon would burden others with his Company, that neither value nor deſire it? Now this is too often the Caſe of a Profeſſing People with reſpect to the gracious Preſence of GOD with them. They don't ſet that Value upon it, which the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Bleſſing calls for: they are not ſo Thankful for it when enjoyed, as they ought to be: they are not ſo deſirous of the Continuance of it, as indeed they ſhould be: nor are they ſo concerned at the awful Tokens of it's withdraw from them, as it might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably expected they would be: not yet ſo Prayerful to him as the ſolemn Diſpenſation calls upon them to be like him, Pſal. 90.13, 15. <hi>Return, O Lord, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy Servants. Make us glad according to the days wherein thou haſt afflicted us, and the years wherein we have ſeen evil.</hi> When a People are ſo regardleſs of the Preſence of GOD, and look upon it as a matter
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002709_0014_0FE61023A12C2830"/>
of Indifferency whether they are favour'd with it or not, no wonder if a Jealous GOD be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to withdraw the ſame from them. Here is Juſt Provocation given him to depart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>Departure from the Pure Inſtituted Worſhip of GOD</hi> will provoke him to Depart. The Glorious GOD who is the ſole Object of Religious Worſhip, has given ſufficient Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his Word, how he will be Worſhipped by his Creatures. And to Worſhip him after a way of our own deviſing, will be found very provoking to him, who is a GOD Jealous for himſelf and his own Glory. Now as to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People, it is but reaſonably ſuppoſed that they have been inſtructed in the Purity of Divine Worſhip; that unto them has been ſhown the Form of GOD's Houſe, and the Faſhion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, with all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and Laws thereof. (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.11.) That they have often been urged to hold faſt the form of ſound words, and contend earneſtly for the Faith delivered to the Saints: to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how they have received and heard, and hold faſt: and beware leſt being led away with the Error of the Wicked, they ſhould fall from their own ſtedfaſtneſs. To leave then the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of GOD for the Traditions of Men, and introduce thoſe Ceremonies into his Worſhip, and add thoſe Inventions of our own thereto which he never Commanded, will be found a plain encroachment upon the Divine
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002709_0015_0FE60FE8386E1B20"/>
Prerogative. And ſuch as are guilty in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect would do well to conſider what Anſwer they ſhall give in to GOD another Day, when he ſhall demand of them, as in Iſa. 1.12. <hi>Who hath required this at your hands?</hi> Matth. 15.8, 9. <hi>This People draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. But in Vain they do worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the</hi> Commandments <hi>of Men.</hi> This will be look'd upon as a Departure from GOD.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AN <hi>unſuitable Carriage towards G0D's Meſſengers &amp; Servants,</hi> will have a dreadful tendency to provoke him to Depart from a People. Where his Goſpel is priz d, and his Servants meet with a kind Entertainment, with ſuch a People GOD will continue his gracious Preſence. With them he has given his Servants Orders to abide; and a Temporal Bleſſing has been wont to go along with the Goſpel. But if a People grow cold in their Affections to Divine Truths, and miſuſe the Meſſengers of the Lord, he who has ſent them, will look upon it as a Contempt caſt upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which he will not bear. There were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crying abominations in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; but yet her Deſtruction ſeems to bear Date from the prevailing of this Sin. 2 Chron. 36.15, 16. <hi>And the Lord God of their Fathers ſent to them by his Meſſengers, riſing up betimes, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, and on his dwelling place. But they mocked
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002709_0016_0FE61025B59B1560"/>
the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord ariſe againſt his People, till there was no Remedy.</hi> Be thou <hi>Inſtructed,</hi> O NEW-ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, and let <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Ruine be a Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thee.</p>
            <p>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cantum.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>INCORRIGIBLENESS under the Judgments of G0D</hi> has alſo a direct tendency to provoke him to depart. This we find to be an Article in the heavy Indictment brought in againſt that People, whom God in the Text calls upon to be Inſtructed, left his Soul depart from them. Jer 53. <hi>O Lord, thou haſt ſtricken them, but they have not grieved: thou haſt conſumed them, but they have refuſed to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a Rock, they have refuſed to return. lſa, 42.25. He hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the ſtrength of Battel; and it hath ſet him on fire round about, yet he know not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</hi> The Deſign of GOD in the Calamities he brings upon his People is to humble, reform and do them good: whereas if theſe prove ineffectual to reclaim them, if in the very face of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iments, they will continue to provoke him, what can be expected, but that being grieved for the hardneſs of their heart, he ſhould withdraw from them? The abuſe of his Goodneſs, with the Contempt of his Rod, is certainly a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002709_0017_0FE61009E1D33DA0"/>
Provocation to him to take his leave of ſuch a People, and to reſolve againſt them; as in Ezek. 24 13. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee,</hi> (i e. uſed Means for thy Purgation and Reformation,) <hi>and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from thy filthineſs any more, till I have cauſed my fury to reſt upon thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. THE general Unprofitableneſs of a People under Goſpel Ordinances, <hi>will be a ſad Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick of GOD's Departure from them,</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs <hi>under the Means of Grace is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking to GOD, and what he will by no Means diſpenſe with. However it may be born with in the</hi> Wilderneſs, <hi>yet in the</hi> Vineyard <hi>it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. Luke 13.6, 7.</hi> A certain man had a Fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came and ſought fruit there on, and found none. Then ſail he unto tbe Dreſſer of his Vineyard, Behold theſe three years I come ſeeking fruit on this Fig-tree, and find none: cut it down, why cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth it the ground? <hi>Agreable where to are thoſe awful words of our Saviour, Matth. 21.43.</hi> Therefore I ſay unto you, The kingdom of God ſhall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. <hi>And how much greater the Danger is, when inſtead of</hi> Good Fruits, <hi>there is an abounding of</hi> Evil Fruits, <hi>may be ſeen from, Iſa. 5.1, —7.</hi> My wel beloved hath a vineyard in a very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bill. And he ſenced it, and gathered out the ſtones thereof, and planted with the choiſst vine, and built a Tower in the midſt of it, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002709_0018_0FE61025C4661558"/>
alſo made a wine preſs therein: and he looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. And now 0 Inhabitants of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and wen of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard, what could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore when I looked that it ſhould bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? And now go to: I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard; I will take away the hedge thereof, and it ſhall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof, and it ſhall be trodden down. And I will lay it waſte: it ſhall not be pruned, nor digged, but there ſhall come up briars and thorns: I will alſo command the Clouds that they rain no rain upon it. For the vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts is the Houſe of Iſrael, and the men of Judah his pleaſant plant: and he looked for Judgment, but behold Oppreſſion; for righteoſneſs, but behold a Cry.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>DECAYS in Religion,</hi> as to the life and power of it, have a ſad tendency to provoke GOD to Depart from a People. When Men abate in their Love to GOD and his Service, decline in Grace and as to a cloſe Walk with GOD; become Formal in Duty, luke-warm and remiſs in Religion, this is moſt hateful and abominable to GOD, and what we often find him warning his People againſt. Hear how he beſpeaks the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2.4, 5. <hi>I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love. Remember therefore from
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002709_0019_0FE61009ED333E48"/>
whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works: or elſe I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candleſtick out of his place.</hi> Thus the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> Rev. 3.2, 3. <hi>Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things which remain that are ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect,</hi> or filled up, <hi>before God. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how thou haſt received and heard, and hold faſt and repent.</hi> And again, Ver. 16. to the Church of <hi>Laodic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a; Becauſe thou art luke-warm and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpue thee out of my mouth,</hi> Other things might here have been mention'd, but the time will not allow it.</p>
            <p>I paſs therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">II. TO ſhow that <hi>upon ſuch Provocation given, GODs Soul may depart from a People.</hi> He is not ſo bound to them that he muſt needs continue his gracious Preſence with them. He may depart from them. The thing is poſſible, as may eaſily be made to appear.</p>
            <p n="1">I. IT is painly ſuppoſed in the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of GOD thus to deal with his People in caſe they depart from him. He has given them ſufficiently to underſtand what they may expect and look for, in Caſe they provoke his Holy Anger and Diſpleaſure againſt them. The Text ſuppoſs that GOD <hi>may</hi> depart from a People, or elſe the Admonition had been of no force at all. Yea there are many expreſs threatnings of this Nature in the Word of GOD.

Then my Anger ſhall be kind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD has <hi>actually</hi> departed from a People upon their forſaking him.

Deſolation will be the ſure Effect of the Lord's Departure from a Land.</p>
            <p>WHEN GOD departs from a People he throws down the Wall of his gracious <hi>Protection</hi> over them. While he is with them, he is as a wall of Fire round about them, and the Glory in the midſt of them. His watchful eye is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually over them for Good, and his Almighty Power always engaged for their Safety, to keep off Troubles from them. Iſa. 27.2, 3. <hi>In that day,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Day when GOD is preſent with his People, in that Day,) <hi>Sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine, I the Lord do keep it. I will water it every moment: leſt any hurt it, I will keep it night &amp; day.</hi> He is on their ſide when Men riſe up againſt them; and all that would devour them ſhall be found <hi>Offenders; Evil ſhall come upon them,</hi> ſaith the Lord, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 2.3.) But WO unto them, when he <hi>departs</hi> from them.

That all the Temporal Curſes threatned in the Book of GOD againſt Diſobedience, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them? When GOD departed from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we read of nothing but perpetual Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, the Enemies roaring in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Burning up all the Synagogues of GOD in the Land, while He himſelf ſeem'd unmindful of their Grief, and regardleſs of their Prayers</p>

He will verify thoſe awful Words upon them, Iſa. 6 9, 10. <hi>Hear ye indeed, but underſtand not, and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not, make the Heart of this People fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart, and convert and be healed.</hi> Rev. 22.11. <hi>He that is unjuſt, let him be unjuſt ſtill; and be which is futhy, let him be filthy ſtill.</hi> The work of Converſion is now at a dreadful ſtand, and the Goſpel it ſelf proves ineffectual to the doing any Good upon the Souls of Men. They are ſealed up under Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Blindneſs and Hardneſs; penally given over by GOD to their own Hearts Luſts, to walk in their own Counſels. No Means uſed to reclaim them ſhall be of the leaſt Service to them. The Curſe is gone out againſt them. Let Fruit grow here no more forever; and ſo they languiſh, pine away and die in their Iniquities. A way is now made for GOD's Anger, and the Flood-gates opened for the Billows of his Wrath to over-whelm and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them.</p>
            <p>THIS, in ſhort, is the deplorable Caſe of that People, from whom GOD's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

belong unto thy peace; but now they are hid,</hi> Alas! <hi>for ever hid from thine eyes.</hi> All Good goes when GOD departs, and all Evil follows upon his Removal.</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>IV.</hi> IT is both the <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> of a People to do all that in them lies to <hi>prevent</hi> ſo great a Calamity, as the Departure of GOD's Soul from them will will certainly carry in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BE Inſtructed, O Jeruſalem</hi>: Be adviſed, be counſell'd and warn'd; for the thing is not a matter of Indifferency, but of the higheſt Importance. It is not a vain thing, becauſe the whole of your Happineſs is concern'd in it.</p>
            <p>FOR clearing this Doctrine, I ſhall</p>
            <p n="1">1. CONSIDER <hi>what is implied</hi> in being thus Inſtructed; or what a People are to do, if they would prevent the ſore Calamity of GOD's Departure from them</p>
            <p n="2">2. GIVE you the <hi>Grounds</hi> of the Point, as they are laid down in the Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> I am to ſhow what is <hi>implied</hi> in being Inſtructed; or what a People are to do, if they would prevent the ſore Calamity of GOD's Departure from them.</p>
            <p>AND to hint only,</p>
            <p n="1">I. IT implies that they be <hi>ſenſible of,</hi> and <hi>humbled for</hi> the leaſt <hi>tokens</hi> of his <hi>Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> from them. GOD's Departure from a ſinful People is not ſudden and at once. He is
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002709_0026_0FE61032D78F4BB8"/>
Infinite in his Patience, and endureth with much long-ſuffering, being loath to leave and give them over to Ruin. And when he is as it were compelled to do ſo, he proceeds very leiſurely in ſuch an Act of Judgment. He gives a People timely notice of it, that ſo they may ſtir up themſelves to take hold of a Departing GOD.</p>
            <p>THUS he dealt with <hi>Judah.</hi> Ezek. 9.3. <hi>The Glory of GOD</hi> goes firſt from the <hi>Cherub,</hi> to the <hi>Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of the Houſe</hi>; and ſtays there, as if it had a mind to be invited back again: then it goes from the <hi>Threſhold of the Houſe,</hi> and ſtands over the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> as if upon a penitent Call, it would drop down again to it's antient Station and Seat, over which it hovered, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.18. And when he was not ſollicited to return, he <hi>departs out of the City,</hi> and <hi>ſtands upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> which is on the <hi>Eaſt part</hi> of the City, (Ezek. 11.23.) looking ſtill towards, and hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the <hi>Temple,</hi> as if loath, to depart and abandon the Place and People. As the Learned Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> obſerves upon the Places.</p>
            <p>NOW to be <hi>Inſtructed,</hi> in the ſenſe of the Text, is for a People to take Notice of the firſt Tokens of GOD's going from them, and to be humbled under the ſenſe of it: to ſee his hand lifted up, ſee it and be afraid, trembling at the Thoughts of his Departure from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT they <hi>Repent of</hi> and <hi>Reform</hi> thoſe <hi>Evils,</hi> that have given him juſt Provocation to forſake them. GOD does not leave a People for nothing, or upon any trivial occaſion: He

               </gap>ſtify him therein; and he will make them to <hi>know, that he has not done without a cauſe, all that he has done unto them.</hi> Ezek. 14 ult. And if they would be Inſtructed to engage the Preſence of GOD ſtill with them, they muſt Repent of, and put away all thoſe GOD-provoking Evils that have excited his Holy Anger againſt them. Jer. 26.2, 3. <hi>Stand in the Court of the Lord's houſe, and ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Cities of Judah, which come to worſhip in the Lord's houſe, all the words that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee to ſpeak unto them, diminiſh not a word. If ſo be they will hearken, and turn every man from his Evil way, that I may repent me of the Evil which I purpoſe to do unto them, becauſe of the Evil of their doings.</hi> Ezek. 18.30, 31. <hi>Repent and turn yourſelves from all your Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, ſo Iniquity ſhall not be your ruin. Cast away from you all your Tranſgreſſions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ye have tranſgreſſed: for why will ye die!</hi> GOD is ready to return to a People upon their ſincere Repentance, and reforming what has been the matter of Offence. An Evidence and Inſtance whereof you have, Judg. 10 15, 16. <hi>And the Children of Iſrael ſaid unto the Lord, We have ſinned, do thou unto us, whatſoever ſeemeth good unto thee; deliver us only we pray this day. And they put away the ſtrange gods from among them, and ſerved the Lord: And his Soul was grieved for the miſery of Iſrael.</hi> 
               <q>He acted towards them like one that felt their Sufferings, pitied them and to ſpeak after the manner of Men, <hi>repented</hi> of his own
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002709_0028_0FE6103B0225D5D0"/>
Proceedings againſt them</q>. Reformation is the only way to recover the Preſence of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting GOD, and obtain Deliverance from a Threatned Deſtruction. Hence the King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> exhorted and argued with his People after this manner, Jonah 3.8, 9. <hi>Let man and beaſt be covered with ſackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: Yea let them turn every one from his Evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we periſh not?</hi> And the Effect was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ver. 10. <hi>God ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the Evil that he had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. IT implies the moſt earneſt <hi>Cries</hi> and <hi>Intreaties</hi>; that he would not utterly forſake or caſt them off. That they unite their Prayers and fervent Supplications for his gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: expreſſing themſelves in ſome ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as that, Pſal. 80.14, 19. <hi>Return we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, O God of Hoſtſ: look down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and behold, and viſit this vine. Turn us again, O Lord God of Hoſtſ: cauſe thy face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Jer. 14.20, 21. <hi>We acknowledge, O Lord, our wickedneſs, and the Iniquity of our Fathers, for we have ſinned againſt thee. Do not abhor us for thy names ſake, do not diſgrace the Throne of thy Glory: remember, break not thy Covenant with us.</hi> This, GOD reaſonably expects from a ſinful

People; and for this very end, he threatens to remove from them. Hoſ. 5.14, 15. <hi>For I will</hi> (ſays GOD,) <hi>be unto Ephraim as a Lion, and as a young Lion to the houſe of Judah: I, even I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ar and go away: I will go and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my place, till they acknowledge their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and ſeek my face: in their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> And unleſs a People do this, they are far from receiving Inſtruction, and doing what in them lies to keep GOD yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. But I come,</p>
            <p n="2">II. TO give you the <hi>Grounds</hi> of the Point, as they are laid down in the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is the <hi>Duty</hi> of a People thus to be <hi>Inſtructed</hi>: thus to repent of and reform every thing that has been amiſs, and earneſtly cry after a with drawing GOD, that he would pleaſe to ſtir up his Strength, and come and ſave them. Without this, a ſinful People fruſtrate the Deſign of GOD, and lay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves open to his moſt terrible rebukes. Zeph. 3.6, 7, 8. <hi>I have cut off the nations, their Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are deſolate, I made their streets waſte, that none paſſeth by: their Cities are deſtroyed, ſo that there is no man, that there is none Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. I ſaid, ſurely thou wilt fear we: thou wilt receive inſtruction, ſo their dwelling ſhould not be cut off: but they roſe early, and corrupted all their doings. Therefore wait ye upon me, ſaith the Lord, until the day that I riſe up to the prey: for my determination is
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002709_0030_0FE74EFA6AA5F418"/>
to pour upon them mine Indignation, even all my fierce anger.</hi> A Refuſing to be Reformed by the more gentle Strokes of GOD's hand, both adds to the People's Guilt, and expoſes them to heavier and much ſharper Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for GOD will by one means or other, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his End upon a provoking People. And if <hi>Rods</hi> won't do, he will Chaſtiſe them with <hi>Scorpions,</hi> yea Chaſtiſe them till he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them. But this brings me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is for the <hi>Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Safety</hi> of a People, to do their utmoſt to prevent the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of GOD's Soul from them. As long as he is with them, they are Safe and Happy. He will ride upon the Heavens for their help, and in his excellency upon the Skies: He will keep off waſting Judgments from them, or whatever might prove an annoyance to them. Zeph 3.16, 17. <hi>In that day it ſhall be ſaid to Jeruſalem, Fear thou not: and to Zion, let not thine hands be ſlack. The Lord thy God in the midst of thee is mighty: he will ſave, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will reſt in his Love, he will joy over thee with ſinging.</hi> But O who can expreſs the very ſad and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition of a People, that have once been Happy in the Enjoyment of GOD's Preſence, but are now deprived of it, caſt out of his ſight, and called by him <hi>Loammi, Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God!</hi> There is nothing now to ſecure them from deſolating Calamities, but they may continually expect
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002709_0031_0FE6101AACE8D380"/>
thoſe Judgments which ſhall root out their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial from under Heaven.</p>
            <p>SO that if a People have any regard to their own Intereſt and Welfare, they can manifeſt it in no better way, than in a hearty Concern and ſtrenuous Endeavour to obtain and keep the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of GOO with them. For if he Depart, they will ſoon be Deſolate.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FROM what has been ſaid we learn upon <hi>whom</hi> a People are to lay the <hi>blame,</hi> in caſe GOD ſhould at any time depart from them. He never breaks firſt with them; but in caſe they would continue Faithful to their Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with him, he would ever be mindful of his Covenant for them. Pſal. 105.8, <hi>&amp;c. He hath remembred his Covenant for ever; the word which he commanded to a thouſand Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Which Covenant he made with Abraham, and his Oath unto Iſaac; and confirmed the ſame unto Jacob for a Law, and to Iſrael for an Everlasting Covenant: ſaying., unto thee will I give the Land of Canaan.</hi> And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manifold Rebellions and Provocations of that ſinful People, for which he did puniſh them in the Wilderneſs; yet had he a reſpect unto his Promiſe and fulfill'd it. Hence <hi>Joſhua</hi> appeals to their very Conſciences for the Proof of this, Joſh. 23.14. <hi>Ye know in all your hearts, and in all your ſouls, that not one thing hath
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002709_0032_0FE6103B0D2F1F40"/>
failed of all the good things, which the Lord your God ſpake concerning you: all are come to paſs unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.</hi> The Lord is with his People, while they are with him; but they are ever firſt in a Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And therefore whatever the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects may be of GOD's Soul's Departing from them, they can blame none but <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> and muſt charge the whole Fault upon their own Prevarications and treacherous Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in his Covenant. So <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old were forced to do. 1 Sam. 12.10. <hi>They cried unto the Lord, and ſaid, We have ſinned, becauſe we have forſaken the Lord.</hi> Dan. 9.11. <hi>Yea all</hi> Iſrael <hi>have tranſgreſſed thy Law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice: therefore the Curſe is poured upon us, and the Oath that is written in the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>the Servant of God, becauſe we have ſinned againſt him.—O Lord, Righteouſneſs belongeth unto thee, but unto us Confuſion of faces as at this Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. MAY GOD's Soul Depart from a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing People? What a <hi>Vanity</hi> then muſt it be for ſuch to <hi>Preſume upon his Preſence</hi> with them, meerly becauſe of their <hi>Covenant-Relation</hi> to him? And yet thus it was with the People of the <hi>Jews</hi>: becauſe GOD had choſen them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other People, and taken them near to himſelf, they would not believe, that ever he would reject them, tho' they were guilty of the groſſeſt abominations.

ſaid, That the City ſhould not be delivered into the hands of the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> But what a Vanity it was, you may ſee from what GOD commanded the Prophet to ſay unto them, Jer. 7.2, <hi>&amp;c. Stand in the gate of the Lord's houſe, and proclaim this word, and ſay, Hear the word of the Lord, all ye of</hi> Judah, <hi>that enter in at theſe gates to worſhip the Lord. Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>amend your ways and your doings, and I will cauſe you to dwell in this place.

He will as the Prophet's Expreſſion is, Zech. 11.10. <hi>Cut aſunder the ſtaff, even</hi> Beauty, <hi>that he may break his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which he had made with the People.</hi> It is O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Faithfulneſs to GOD, that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, his Preſence with a People, and not any Profeſſion or Covenant Relation, that they may make, or ſtand in to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. DO'S the Departure of GOD from a People, <hi>open a Door for Deſolating Judgments,</hi> and is it their <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> to do all they can to <hi>prevent his Removal?</hi> This then plainly Inſtructs us what the Duty and preſent Buſineſs of this People is.</p>

                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:002709_0034_0FE6103C1A7C7CB0"/>THAT GOD is Departing, and upon his way from us, is too plain to be denied. Every one that obſerves any thing cannot but ſee and take notice of it.</p>
               <p>GOD has been marching up and down the Land in Indignation and Wrath, viſiting our Iniquities, and puniſhing our Tranſgreſſions by a Series of Judgments; and yet we are not Humbled nor Reformed to this very Day. He has given us frequent and ſolemn warning of his Departure, and there are thoſe things moſt certainly to be found among us, which are aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preſages of his forſaking us.</p>
               <p>IF we compare our ſelves with <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, our manners with theirs, we ſhall find that there was ſcarce any Sin they were chargeable with, (ſave their more groſs <hi>Idolatry,</hi>) but the ſame may be found among our ſelves. And what can we plead why GOD ſhould not leave us as he did them? Are not our forgetfulneſs of GOD and Diſobedience to his Commands, our Rebellions and Luſtings, our Perfidy and Murmurings equal to theirs? And beſides the Evils mentioned under the <hi>Second Doctrine</hi>; and as to the more heinous Tranſgreſſions of the Law, <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> and <hi>Injustice, Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Uncleanneſs, Lying, Swearing,</hi> and <hi>Prophaning</hi> the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Day</hi> of GOD, we muſt confeſs that the Land is full of Sin, and deſerves to be forſaken of the Holy One of Iſrael.</p>

And GOD may now expoſtulate with and chide us juſt as he did Backſliding <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom we are ſo very like unto, Jer. 2.2, 5, 31. <hi>Go and cry in the ears of Jeruſalem, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, I remember thee, the kindneſs of thy Youth, the love of thine eſpouſals, when thou iventest after me in the wilderneſs, in a land that was not ſown.

A Carnal, Selfiſh and Worldly Spirit prevails, and threatens to eat out the heart of Religion and a Formal <hi>Liolicean</hi> Indifferency is what the moſt of Profeſſors are dangerouſly Sick of, and it will be well if they don't Die of the Diſtemper.

               <p>AND in what way can you better Evidence your ſelves ſo? than by doing all that in you lies, that there may be a Reformation of thoſe Evils, which threaten us with the Loſs of God's Favour, and due Encouragement given to thoſe things, which will be ſo many Tokens for Good that GOD will not leave and forſake us.</p>
               <p>IF then you will permit the meaneſt of the Lord's Servants to be your Monitor, to put you in Remembrance of thoſe things which we truſt you know and are eſtabliſhed in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of, I would with all poſſible Deference ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a few things briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="unknown:002709_0038_0FE610039982F5C8"/>IT is without Controverſy a Duty indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably Incumbent upon the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> (who is <hi>Cuſtos Utriuſque Tabula</hi>) to ſee to it, that the <hi>Glorious G0D he acknowledged and worſhip'd</hi> according to his own <hi>Preſcription</hi> and <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> without the addition of <hi>Humane Inventions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> be maintain'd and kept <hi>pure,</hi> eſpecially where a <hi>peculiar Regard</hi> to it has been the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Foundation</hi> of a <hi>People's Settlement,</hi> as is our <hi>own Caſe</hi> moſt certainly.</p>
               <p>THAT the <hi>Great and Dreadful Name of G0D</hi> be <hi>reverenc'd</hi> and <hi>fear'd</hi>; and that the Breakers of the <hi>Third Commandment</hi> by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Oaths and Helliſh Curſes be not ſuffered, to eſcape a juſt Puniſhment from Men.</p>
               <p>THAT the <hi>Holy Sabbath</hi> of the Lord, which he himſelf has Sanctified, be Religiouſly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and every thing tending to the violation of it diſcountenanced and ſuppreſs'd: that his <hi>Publick Worſhip</hi> be attended, and the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the Word ſuitably provided for.</p>
               <p>AND this leads me naturally to ſay, It is incumbent upon YOU the Rulers of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to take effectual Care, that thoſe who are devoted to the Service of the Sanctuary, and called to wait at the Altar, be partakers with the Altar. I mean as the Apoſtle expounds it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. that according to Divine Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the goſpel.</hi> That the <hi>Miniſters of CHRIST and Religion</hi> ſhould have an <hi>honourable Support</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:002709_0039_0FE60FEE60A15908"/>
from thoſe among whom they ſpend their Thought, Time and Strength; and not be forced, in ways unbecoming their Station and Character, to provide for themſelves and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: or elſe be reduced to Penury and Want, which in this Worldly-minded and Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutted Age, will effectually bring not only the Clergy themſelves, but the very Office of the Miniſtry into the greateſt Contempt. It is recorded to the Everlaſting Honour of that good King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> (2 Chron. 30.22.) that he <hi>ſpake comfortably unto all the</hi> Levites <hi>that taught the good knowledge of the lord.</hi> He aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them of his Princely Favour and Paternal Care, and that nothing on his part ſhould be wanting for their Encouragement and Comfort. And of that Excellent Governour <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who truly ſought the Welfare of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it is obſerv'd, Neh. 13.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That when he <hi>perceived that the Portions of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites had not been given them,</hi> he <hi>contended about it,</hi> and took ſpeedy Care for the redreſs of their Grievances. And from the Steps alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy taken by the Government, will our Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rulers now allow the <hi>Oppreſſed</hi> Miniſters of JESUS CHRIST humbly to hope, that this Matter ſhall have a Thorough Conſideration with them: that by means hereof, thro' the Thanksgiving of many on your account, Glory may redound to GOD.</p>
               <p>Again, IT lies upon yon our Fathers in the Goverment, to have a ſingular Concern for the <hi>Means of Education,</hi> and training up of Youth
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002709_0040_0FE61003A3DD3A88"/>
for Future Service: that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which have been our <hi>Diſtinguiſhing Glory</hi> among the Provinces, may flouriſh abundantly. That <hi>Inferiour Schools</hi> may be cheriſh'd, and the <hi>College</hi> in ſpecial, which GOD has made ſo great a Bleſſing to this People from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, tenderly regarded and encouraged; the True Intereſt of it; ever lie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ar your Hearts, and be vigorouſly purſued. May that <hi>Society</hi> always live before GOD.—May the wide Breach made upon it be happily repair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.—And may it ever be a Seminary of <hi>Piety</hi> and the moſt uſeful <hi>Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, THE Honour of GOD calls for it, that you exert all that Authority and Power he has veſted you with, for the Suppreſſion of thoſe <hi>growing Evils,</hi> ſuch as <hi>horrible Injustice</hi> and <hi>cruel Extortion, Uncleanneſs, Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Lying, Stealing</hi> and the like, which like a mighty Torrent, threaten to carry all before them. Thus muſt you be a <hi>Terror to Evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore, IT concerns Civil Rulers to ſee to it that the <hi>Publick Faith</hi> be preſerv'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violate and Sacred; that the <hi>Publick Credit</hi> be as good or better Security than any Private Bond can be; that thoſe who ſerve the beſt Intereſts of it, be no ſufferers by a Failure here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but may be able with juſt reaſon and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety to uſe this Speech, The Lord bleſs thee, <hi>O Habitation of Juſtice and Mountain of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:002709_0041_0FE60FF1032557F8"/>In fine, CIVIL Rulers are to be themſelves ſhining <hi>Patterns of Religion</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs</hi>; to go before their People in every thing that is vertuous and praiſe-worthy, and by their holy unblameable Converſation provoke others to an Imitation of them; This will be a good Means to promote the Bleſſed work of <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> among us, which will be for the length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of our Tranquillity.</p>
               <p>SUFFER then the word of Exhortation, which ſpeaketh to you as unto Rulers, Ezra 10.4. <hi>Ariſe, for this matter belongeth unto you.</hi> And may all the Lord's People be with you, in their earneſt Supplications and Payers, that the GOD of Heaven would put this Honour upon you, of making you the <hi>Inſtrumental Saviours</hi> of a ſinful ſinking People, that are in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects brought very Low. <hi>ſo let the Lord our God be with you, and let all the People ſay,</hi> Amen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. LET me apply my ſelf to my <hi>Reverend Fathers and Brethren</hi> in the <hi>Miniſtry</hi>: who, 'tis to be hop'd, will look upon themſelves in this Day of ſad Degeneracy, peculiarly obliged to do their utmoſt, that GOD may not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked finally to depart from this People. This is no more than what GOD and Man juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from us, and our Office binds us to.</p>
               <p>WE are Watchmen upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Walls, whoſe proper Buſineſs it is to deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y Dangers,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002709_0042_0FE6103C25709C28"/>
and give ſeaſonable Notice thereof: to obſerve the Sins of the Times, and the awful Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of GOD's Departure, and thereupon to <hi>Cry aloud, an ſpare not, lift up our voices like a Trumpet, and ſhew the People their Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> Nor can we hold our Peace, and be Guiltleſs. We are to warn the wicked, that they turn from their Evil ways, and by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings, Counſels, Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Entreaties, do what we can to engage them to Repentance, as ever we would be Pure from their Blood, and obtain the Divine Favour for them. A Flaming Zeal for the Honour of GOD and againſt Sin, ſhould ever inſpire and influence us. We muſt riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Evil Doers, and ſtand up for GOD againſt the Workers of Iniquity; and whether Men will hear, or whether they will forbear, we may not fail to bear a due Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the GOD-provoking Evils that are to be found in the midſt of us.</p>
               <p>NOR is all this enough, but it concerns us alſo by the peculiar Sanctity of our Lives to condemn the Practices of the World and ſhow Men the way to Heaven; that others in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing us may not fail to obtain Eternal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs. We ſhould ſhine in our Converſations, as well as burn in our Doctrine, and be Patterns of good Works.</p>
               <p>A Difficult Service we truly have, attended with more than ordinary Temptations and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements:
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002709_0043_0FE6101C61F23F20"/>
however it is a Good Work, and we ſerve a Good Maſter in it; and therefore let us not ſink under our Burden of Service for GOD, or of Suffering from an ungrateful World, but in an humble Dependance upon the Strength and Grace of CHRIST, labour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves Faithful unto him that hath Called us. Let us heartily grieve and mourn for the Evils which we can't Reform, and at the ſame time improve all the Intereſt we have in Heaven, that GOD's Soul may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted from us. Joel 2.17. <hi>Let the Prieſts the Miniſters of the Lord, weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them ſay, Spare thy People, O Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>YEA tho' we may have too much reaſon to bewail the unſucceſsfulneſs of our endeavours, that we <hi>labour in vain,</hi> and <hi>ſpend our ſtrength for noughts</hi>: Yet let this be our Comfort, that ſurely our Judgment is with the Lord, and our work with our GOD. Though <hi>Iſrael</hi> be not gathered, yet ſhall we be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and our GOD will be our Strength and exceeding great Reward.</p>
               <p>IN the laſt place,</p>
               <p n="3">3. LET it be a ſolemn Call to this whole <hi>People,</hi> to <hi>return every Man from his Evil way,</hi> and <hi>amend his doings,</hi> that GOD's Soul may not abhor us.</p>
               <p>AS ever we value the Favour of GOD and deſire to be Happy in the Enjoyment of it, let

us put away our abominations out of his fight, and beware of every thing that may provoke him to leave us: complying with that his voice to us at this Day, Iſa. 1.16, 17. <hi>Waſh ye make you clean, put away the Evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well.</hi> Let every one <hi>Repent of his wickedneſs, ſaying, What have I done? Be as a Dove in the valley, mourning for his own Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and beſufre to Reform what has been amiſs in his own Heart and Life.—And Oh that there were this token for Good among us, that GOD will not forſake us, even the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth a Spirit of <hi>Supplication</hi> and <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon this whole People, that being ſenſible of his Anger, we may follow hard after him, by fervent Prayer hold him faſt, and reſolve that we will not let him go!—Oh that it might be ſaid of us, as of thoſe, 1 Sam. 7.2. <hi>And all the houſe of Iſrael lamented after the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WERE it once come to this, he would ſoon <hi>ariſe for our help, and redeem us for his mercies ſake.</hi>—Then would the Lord <hi>awake as one out of ſleep, and like a mighty man that ſhouteth by reaſon of wine; then would he ſmite our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as in the binder parts; and put them to a perpetual Reproach.</hi>—Then ſhould the <hi>Earth yield her increaſe, and God, even our own God would Bleſs us.</hi>—Then would he extricate us out of all our <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and continue to us the Enjoyment of all our <hi>Pleaſant things.</hi> In a word, then would he <hi>cauſe the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
