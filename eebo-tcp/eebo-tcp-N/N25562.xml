            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THIS pamphlet was publiſhed in London about four months ago. The infamous Letter of Paine ſeems to have produced, in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that degree of indignation and abhorrence, which the complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted crime of calumny, ingratitude, and perfidy, is calculated to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in every juſt and generous mind. This ſentiment of the Britiſh public, MR. KENNEDY has moſt forcibly expreſſed. He has traced the malignant traitor through the labyrinth of his nefarious career, from the firſt to the laſt of his publications: he has brought forward many facts not generally known; has proved Paine to have been a hireling of France, <hi>from the cloſe of the American revolution;</hi> and has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, in glaring colours, his abominable ingratitude to GENERAL WASHINGTON, whoſe character, if it ſtood in need of defence, has here ſound a zealous and able defender.</p>
            <p>It muſt be a pleaſure to every good man, and particularly to every good American, to ſee that all men of talents, honour and honeſty, even in foreign countries, feel themſelves intereſted in preſerving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarniſhed, the ſame of the MAN who is the pride of America; and, proportioned to this pleaſure, muſt be the pain, the ſhame, and the confuſion of his unprincipled and viperous enemies.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO TOM PAINE's <hi>LETTER</hi> TO <hi>GENERAL</hi> WASHINGTON.</head>
            <p>AMID the convulſions, which have for ſome years unhappily agitated the European world— Amid the horrors of a Revolution, founded on animoſities, hatreds, maſſacres, and blood, in which the human character has been exhibited in all its deformity, no man has laboured more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſingly to unhinge the links of ſocial order—and to overturn Religion, Morality and Government, than the enthuſiaſtic, the depraved, the ungrateful Tom Paine.—</p>
            <p>Having developed the inveterate malice, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cruelty of his character in a ſeries of wild diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions and dangerous theories, all tending to the overthrow of general proſperity and individual happineſs in every country, he has now conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his guilt, and given the moſt evident proofs of the foulneſs of his heart, by ſacrificing the laſt little remnant of imputed patriotiſm, to a faithleſs and cowardly attack on his early benefactor and friend.</p>
            <p>We are not ſurpriſed, becauſe we diſcover plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the immediate cauſe of the violent change that has dictated the declarations of diſcontent, and threats of hoſtility, which continue to fill the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033947_0004_0FF9D090F6ECBEC8"/>of the French Journals, againſt the firm and prudent conduct of the American Congreſs, aided by their reſpectable Preſident.—It is the buſineſs of the deſigning, ill-intentioned, ambitious leaders of faction in France, under the cloak of liberty, to practiſe all the arts of calumny, to miſlead the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and hurry them into the wildeſt meaſures. That Tom Paine ſhould ſeize with avidity and with an activity, unfortunately in him combined with a moſt malignant diſpoſition, every channel of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective, and abuſe and injury againſt the Britiſh Government, we cannot wonder at.—But that he ſhould add to the black catalogue of his crimes, that of deep ingratitude, by aiming to ſtab the ſame, to murder the character of the man that cheriſhed his political infancy, and brought him forward into public life, proves that the aſſumed garb of modern philoſophy is but a ſafer covering for the dagger of the aſſaſſin. An enemy of Britain by principles of rebellion, by habits of abuſe, by circumſtances of political elevation and private intereſt, we have ſeen him direct the whole force of his impoſing talents, the ſpecious trick of ſmooth phraſeology, the cant of popular prejudices, to diſcolour, to traduce, the eſtabliſhed forms of government and to overthrow the conſtitution of thoſe kingdoms.—But in his laſt performance, he far out-does his uſual out-doings— he out-ſtrips depravity—and high o'er-leaping over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaps all bounds,—faithful to his avowed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of anarchy and commotion, he boldly ſoars to the laſt and greateſt of crimes, ingratitude, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033947_0005_0FF9D02CDE0CD348"/>arraigns the illuſtrious Waſhington for his perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and virtuous attachment to the order, the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the American States.</p>
            <p>In the phrenzy of Gallic zeal, he forgets that he fell a victim in his turn to the fury of faction; and that in deſpite of his labours for a ſeries of years in the cauſe of revolutionary government, he was conſigned to a dungeon; and eventually reſcued from the guillotine, which carried off his fellow-actors on the great revolutionary theatre, after ſtrutting their hour on the bloody ſtage, only by the generous interference of thoſe peaceful and humane Americans, whom he now loads with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and obloquy, becauſe they will not ſacrifice individual virtue, and rational wiſdom, to the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent dictation of French partizans, and domeſtic anarchiſts.</p>
            <p>One would have thought that the ſituation of diſtreſs and ſuffering, into which Paine was hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, among the other revolutionary heroes of his day, and his narrow eſcape from the gripe of the guillotine, ſhould have checked the <hi>cacoethos ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi,</hi> and awed him from meddling further in political affairs. But it ſeems that confinement tended only to ſharpen the edge of calumny, and to point more keenly the ſhafts of ſlander againſt all that men are taught to reſpect in ſociety—Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and Religion. The moment of his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from priſon, was like the opening of Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dora's box, marked by the iſſuing forth of a more peſtilential vapour than what he had before ſent
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033947_0006_0FF9D095E0FB2D20"/>into the world. Religion, that great cement and bond of public order—the gracious harbinger of peace and happineſs to mankind, became the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his ſcurrillity and ridicule. Maxims, arrayed in all the falſe colourings and tinſel glare of ſubtle attraction, were propagated and diligently ſpread abroad, to catch the prejudices of the unthinking and ignorant, as well as to gratify the conceits and vanity of the diſſolute and profane.</p>
            <p>Happily, in this bloated publication, his views have failed; his itch of ſcribbling, his mania of innovation, outran diſcretion; and the moſt zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous advocates after reform, the moſt furious zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots for his Rights of Man, were ſorely chagrined, vexed, diſguſted, and irritated, that he ſhould ſo ſoon diſcover the latitude of their intentions, and expoſe a ſyſtem, menacing with abſolute deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the true baſis of liberty and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They confeſſed that Mr. Paine miſtook the Britiſh character, when he uſhered in, with all the pomp of laboured talent and detailed ſubtlety, thoſe atheiſtical tenets which make the Chriſtian revolt from the book and from the man, with honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation: The political reformers, who looked upon him before as their ſureſt champion, felt how much the public opinion would inſtantly turn againſt the author of thoſe atrocious ſyſtems which fill the humane and Chriſtian heart with terror and diſmay.</p>
            <p>Every man attached to the Chriſtian diſpenſation ſaw clearly that there was ſome latent deſign, ſome
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033947_0007_0FF9D033D472DD00"/>ſecret purpoſe, ſome ſoul intention of public miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, in an open attack upon religion; becauſe every thinking man is fully convinced that an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to overthrow religious principles, evinces a diſpoſition hoſtile to all reſtraints of law and ſocial order, and inimical to that ſalutary doctrine, which inculcates peace on earth, and good-will among men.</p>
            <p>Mr. Paine, in the full career of vanity, and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſupport his former oſtentatious produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had met with, from the agitators of ſedition, proudly imagined that public opinion would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at his command; that a people deluded for a while by the ſophiſtry, the ſpecious embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of fantaſtic novelty, and prepared by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue of itinerant declaimers and active partizans, would embrace, with ardour, any ſyſtem promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by him, however inconſiſtent or diſeaſed.— He flattered himſelf that the momentary celebrity of the Rights of Man, would eſtabliſh his Age of Reaſon; and the name of Tom Paine triumph over the mild doctrines of the Chriſtian diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In his ſtrenuous efforts to promote irreligion and immorality, and to inculcate a contempt of the moſt ſacred obligations, he takes care to call up the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of the vulgar, by levelling the artillery of his ſlander againſt the Clergy: Judging with acute cunning, that to relax and undermine the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and ties of religion, the beſt method is to begin by leſſening that awe and reſpect, which we
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033947_0008_0FF9D036E9200F98"/>ought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>tertain for a body of men, who are paticularly appointed to inſtruct us in the ways of true piety and virtue, and who, in general, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from us the utmoſt regard.</p>
            <p>It is to be lamented, that men often pervert ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to the worſt of purpoſes—</p>

            <p>They labour to darken and corrupt the minds of others, with unremitting earneſtneſs; they ſeduce the multitude to their views by ſhattering their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions —by dreſſing up falſehood in the colours of truth, and vice in the garb of virtue. The wiſe and good may look with contempt and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the endeavours of ſuch men; but, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, they are too apt to gain credit and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the greater number.</p>
            <p>Happily for mankind, the Age of Reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the antidote to the poiſon of the Rights of Man. Paine's moſt zealous advocates were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſhame and mortification at the total diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of religious character and public opinion, in their favourite hero of liberty.—The democratic ſcribes were obliged to abandon his defence for the time, and even to confeſs the folly, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of his attack upon religion.—While, on the other hand, all men of ſober reflexion ſaw in that publication the extreme licentionſneſs over atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the extreme freedom of the preſs; where opinions are hazarded, and doctrines introduced,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033947_0009_0FF9CFC252A4E360"/>ſubverſive of all thoſe relative duties, which unite Men in Society.</p>
            <p>It is a maxim, founded on truth, that Religion is the firmeſt foundation of honour and true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in every ſtate; and the moſt permanent pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and ſtrongeſt ſupport in every form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A curſory view of the annals of former ages will ſufficiently convince us, that every State and Kingdom flouriſhed or decayed, were happy or convulſed, in proportion as they were more or leſs religious. The reaſon is plain. Individuals will certainly be puniſhed or rewarded in another life according to their actions here—but public communities and ſtates, as ſuch, can only be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded or puniſhed in this world; and, therefore, national wickedneſs muſt ever expect public and national puniſhment.</p>
            <p>This ſhould be a leſſon to all who are placed in high ſtations, and fill the feat of power, to exhibit the brighteſt examples of truth and juſtice, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and religion. The examples of the great will induce more to tread the paths of virtue than the inſtructions of the moſt eloquent preacher, or the moſt finiſhed eſſays of the fineſt writer.</p>
            <p>In our own moſt gracious Sovereign, and in his Royal Confort, we behold bright cramples of moral excellence and virtuous life. We glory in a monarch whoſe ſole aim and ſtudy is to eſtabliſh law and religion, in their full and offential force, againſt a tide of innovadon and danger to public happineſs. And ſurely, we may truly pronounce
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033947_0010_0FF9D040B28BB668"/>that for ſuch gracious purpoſes, "the powers that be, are ordained of God."—When power and virtue are thus united for the public good, what can be more juſt and beneficial?</p>
            <p>The conduct, the ſpeeches, the letters of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington, have ever manifeſted a ſtrong ſenſe of religion and virtue.—That great Man has ever evinced his conviction of this truth—viz.</p>
            <p>We may pain the beauties of virtue and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the moſt alluring colours; but it is exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alone that muſt prevail over the multitude, and teach the ignorant and thoughtleſs, wiſdom. We muſt practically adore our Creator, love our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures, and obey the dictates of conſcience, that faithful monitor, placed by Omnipotence in the human breaſt. We profeſs Chriſtianity—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in it we find every precept neceſſary to raiſe and elevate human nature to perfection; and, at the ſame time, the pleaſing aſſurance of an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and propitiation for the tranſgreſſions and imperfections of the human race. The more this religion is examined, the more we are convinced of its divine original: Time, the unerring touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of truth, confirms its verity and proclaims its power.</p>
            <p>If there is any foundation in the above obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</p>
            <p>"And that there is, all Nature ſpeaks aloud"— How dreadful muſt be the terrors of Tom Paine, if conſcience is ever awakened in ſuch breaſts? How fearful the repreſentation of the wide and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033947_0011_0FF9D04BE6EAC8A8"/>horrible waſte, which his guilty mind would ſpread among mankind—as the immediate conſequence of his infernal Gallic creed—<hi>Death is an eternal ſleep.</hi>

            <p>While we reprobate and deteſt the impious ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems promulgated in the Age of Reaſon; while we conſign to merited contempt its daring author, we muſt not omit paying the juſt tribute of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement to the abilities of a prelate, who has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> well deſerved of mankind by his clear argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative and highly impreſſive refutation of the impious doctrines of the maniac Paine. With great perſpicuity, preciſion, and an eminent diſplay of learning, the right reverend divine improves the underſtanding of the reader, corrects the aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of diſordered imagination, and in the moſt convincing manner unfolds the ſacred truths of the Chriſtian Diſpenſation. With an even flow of ſtrong reaſoning and good humour, he tempers ſeverity of reprehenſion, by an animated earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to recal the Atheiſt from the impiety of his ways; and leads the reader ſmiling and pleaſed over the rocks and ſands of irreligion, into the paths of knowledge, virtue, law and government.</p>
            <p>But to return to the immediate ſubject of his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Mr. Paine, with the uſual good intention towards the Britiſh government and Britiſh admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, recurs in many pages to his old habits of abuſe of our conſtitution—he vomits up his gall
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033947_0012_0FF9D09C80E704A0"/>on that ſubject with drunken<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a matter of fact, that for many months paſt, Tom Paine has totally given himſelf up to habits of drunkenneſs and blaſphemy—like all lawleſs and profligate ſpirits, to blunt the avenging ſtings of remorſe, he has delivered himſelf over to ſtrong libations of pure cogniac, and is daily plunged in intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſtupor—Such is ever the end of the diſſolute and wicked ſcoffers of God and his holy laws.</note> eructation, and gives us large doſes of his former libellous animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on our happy combination of king, lords, and commons—while writing profeſſedly to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington, he allows himſelf to be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a long ſtrain of invective, and re-aſſerts, with his uſual vehemence of aggravating ſtile, that every thing is ſlavery which reſtrains men in any part of their freedom: but we ſee, by too near an inſtance, what is to be gained by this doctrine—by an intemperate uncontroulable luſt of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the French have depopulated their own once-fertile and happy provinces, ſpread devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over the neighbouring countries; and their preſent attempts aim to impart to our proſperous country the fraternizing law of deſolation and maſſacre. Nor does the melancholy experience they have had in attempting an invaſion of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, deter them from holding out ſimilar threats againſt the ſhores of Britain, throughout our whole line of coaſt.</p>
            <p>May I aſk, what are the cauſes that thus give the temptation to our furious Gallic neighbours to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033947_0013_0FF9D0536215BD10"/>attempt to deſtroy us?—It is in them then a vile jealouſy of our national proſperity, of our domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic comforts, of our commercial enterpriſe, of our conſtitution, and of our laws. Without a regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſyſtem of government, men cannot enjoy what belongs to each in particular; nor can a nation be ſecure, or preſerve itſelf in general. While ſubjects live in a competent ſhare of freedom, it is ſurely unnatural to have public harmony and ſymmetry of law interrupted by means that were originally made uſe of to attain it. In deſpite of the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory comments of maddened Paine, while our cities are populous, thriving and great, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce extenſive and flouriſhing, our conſtitution envied and admired, I am not aſhamed to own my low-ſpirited frailty in preferring ſuch a model of government as affords reaſonable enjoyment to a free people, before that by which empire is to be founded at home in blood, and extended abroad by a profuſion of millions of lives.</p>
            <p>Beſides, however, men may differ on various political queſtions, there is an argument in this caſe which precludes any anſwer—it is this—we could not ſubſiſt under the deſpotiſm of one, or the tyranny of many. As a great writer obſerves, we are to conſider that we are a very little ſpot in the map of the world, and make a very great figure only by trade, which is the creature of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. One deſtroyed, the other falls to the ground
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033947_0014_0FF9B983BB36B100"/>by a natural conſequence that will not admit a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>If we would be meaſured ſolely by our acres, we are a poor inconſiderable people: we are exalted above our natural bounds by our good government and excellent laws.</p>
            <p>We ſhould be no more a people, nor could England longer keep its name, commerce and wealth, from the moment that the revolutionary movements of innovation and anarchy took place. The vital ſtrength that ſupports us being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, we ſhould be no more than the carcaſe of a nation, with no better ſecurity than that of pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and murder: and ſubſiſting upon no other terms than the unbridled ferocity of ſucceſſive fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, alternately rioting in blood. In the judgment, therefore, of moderate men, there is ſuch a ſhort deciſion to be made on
this ſubject, that in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe kingdoms, and the ſame will hold good of the American States, any reform of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic complexion is as dangerous a thing to be wiſhed, as I hope is will be impoſſible to be attained—Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is the natural ally of America.</p>
            <p>The animoſities of the American revolution having long ſince ſubſided, and melted into a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of philanthropy, mutual good will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intercourſe; the bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The rattleſnake, compared with Tom Paine, is an innocent animal. The rattleſnake will baſk in ſunſhine of its native fields—ſpread its volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous body out at length to the genial heat—and man, woman and child may paſs uninjured by. It is only when trodden upon or attacked by ſcythe, ſickle or ſtick, that it is rouſed to rage, to coil up its variety of folds, to hiſs horror, and ſound its multitudinuous rattles, and to prepare for defence, in conſequence of offence—the bite is poiſon, the poiſon is death. Follow up the compariſon.</p>
            <p>Tom Paine is a peſt in ſociety. His firſt political efforts were directed againſt the country that gave him birth. With more acrimony of invective, with more eagerneſs of fiery zeal than the public men in America approved, he attacked the monarchy, the conſtitution of England; and reviled the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent caution of thoſe ſtates, that wiſhed to open a channel of accommodation and reconciliation with Britain, before a formal and final ſeparation was proclaimed. After the declaration of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I forbear to comment on his writings; he avowed himſelf a renegado from Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033947_0016_0FF9D0A54DC3B650"/>and boaſted his citizenſhip in America. But why, after the peace; why, after a full acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of the independence of America—after a commencement was made of mutual confidence, harmony, and commerce, why ſtill cheriſh a latent poiſon, an unforgiving enmity towards the country that gave him birth? Nay, more; why relinquiſh the adopted ſoil of liberty, and return to Europe to diſturb the peace, the government of a country he had abjured? Why ſit down, in ſullen ſilent diſaffection, to ſpread his peſtilential vapours throughout Britain; and to ſap the foundation of all law, human and divine? Why continue the deſtructive tenor of his evil ways, to point the dagger of malevolence at the breaſt of his former patron, benefactor, and friend, and aim to wound the unſullied, unruffled boſom of a Waſhington? After theſe ſhort obſervations, look to the rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnake, look to Tom Paine—which is the more dangerous, the more deſtructive animal?</p>
            <p>Here I beg leave to call the reader's attention to a circumſtance that tends ſtrongly to elucidate and explain this ſettled, ſubtle, enthuſiaſtic ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in this man-ſnake, againſt general Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and the other elevated characters of America, againſt whom he largely deals out his frothy pages of abuſe. 'Tis a circumſtance not known in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, perhaps forgotten in America along with the individual, but not the leſs true, nor, at this
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033947_0017_0FF9B92D88527670"/>time, leſs worthy of elucidation. I appeal to the recollection of the American gentlemen now in London; I appeal to the people of Philadelphia, and New-York, who particularly witneſſed the tranſaction; I appeal to Tom Paine himſelf; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the retroſpect muſt harrow up his ſoul to a horrific ſenſe of his reſtleſs, unceaſing animoſity, to all that is Britiſh, to all that borders on modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, loyalty, humanity, and honour.</p>
            <p>After the ratification of the treaty of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and peace with America; after the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the American States by the Britiſh troops, in the lapſe of a few months, the memory of the paſt diſaſters and calamities of war began to ſoften down. Men of the firſt abilities, both in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican field and in the American cabinet, ſoon deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried the crooked policy, the haughty intent of France, by a magiſterial boaſt of their aid and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to bow down the American ſpirit to a ſervile dependence on French councils and French friendſhip, by fettering the intercourſe with Great Britain. For this purpoſe, French adventurers poured in on all quarters: Tom Paine was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by French agents to brandiſh his gooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quill, in order to cheriſh the memory of paſt ſcenes of battle and devaſtation, and to plant an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred between the two countries. With his uſual alacrity in the cauſe of diſcord and diſunion, this dark conſpirator againſt the peace of mankind,

He ſecretly ſet forward the violent partizans of the French faction in the great cities, to mortify, by ſarcaſtic ſheers on every occaſion, thoſe ſuppoſed royaliſts and their advocates.

            <p>But where was the man to be found to enter the liſts againſt this popular writer? It required a prudent ſkill to wield the pen at ſuch a criſis; to reſcue, from reproach and prejudices, an induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body of men, who had remained quietly at their homes to eſcape the ſtorm of war,—to undertake the cauſe of injured innocence, it required the moſt delicate expreſſion, the moſt benevolent exertion of philanthropy. That man appeared; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Roman ſignature, with manly firmneſs, but, in temperate language and ſound argument, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted the violent invectives of Mr. Paine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butted the foul accuſations of intrigue and danger from Britiſh loyaliſts, or Britiſh intercourſe; and, by pointing out the community of commercial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, ſhewing the utility of an extenſive trade with Britiſh merchants, whoſe ſolid capitals, good faith, and extenſive manufactures, were the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt earneſt of future and permanent proſperity to young America, he gradually ſmoothed and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monized the public mind, and levelled to the ground the baſeleſs fabric of prejudice and hatred, conjured up by the emiſſaries of France—with Tom Paine at their head.</p>

            <p>The reader will naturally aſk, what became of this celebrated champion of anarchy? I will anſwer by a queſtion—what brought the demon of diſcord back into Europe? The contempt he fell into, the total diſregard and abhorrence which he experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced among the circles of the great and good in America, manifeſted his ſtate of public degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the malevolence of his mind, ſuggeſted the application of his talents to the embroiling the European continent; and the inauſpicious winds wafted him, alas! too ſafely, to our ſhores, to ſharpen the dagger of rebellion, and to try to plunge a nation of freemen into a multitude of aſſaſſins.</p>
            <p>May I here be allowed a few words on our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative condition.</p>
            <p>When we contemplate our real ſituation, the fertility of our ſoil, the conſtitution of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the many other bleſſings peculiar to ourſelves, we have reaſon to thank Heaven that we were born in ſo happy a country. But, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily, the reſtleſs mind of man always wanders abroad, ſeeking ſome fanciful of diſtant ſcene of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033947_0022_0FF9D0C8524830E8"/>felicity, while the happineſs in poſſeſſion is faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoyed or loſt in inſenſibility, or diſquietude.</p>
            <p>In deſpite of the high colourings, and falſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing luſtre of our modern reformers, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatory pages are hurried through the chemical laboratory of multitudinous editions, to catch the gape, and ſtare of the vulgar, when we ſit down diſpaſſionately to compare our condition with that of moſt other countries of Europe, the compariſon ought to inſire us with gratitude to our rulers, with fortitude and reſolute union to meet the neceſſary burdens, for the more firm enjoyment of domeſtic ſecurity and family com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. In moſt parts of France, and throughout the countries they have invaded, we ſee numerous provinces groaning under the weight of French tyranny and oppreſſion; and, as an increaſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutionary wretchedneſs, we behold the capital expoſed to all the calamities of latent conſpiracies:—We ſee the inhabitants of the different great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties plundered by alternate depredators, or ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with wanton cruelty. Surely, to be free from all the various ſcenes of miſery, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great part of the Continent a ſpectacle of woe and horror;—to be ſecure from the deplorable, melancholy, and affecting ſtate of ſubjection and pillage, which, at this moment, overwhelm the rich provinces of Italy,—muſt make a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on our minds, and rouſe us to utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, to co-operate by the free tender of our lives and fortunes, to avert ſimilar dangers from
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033947_0023_0FF9D0D0E22CF660"/>our ſhores. Why is it, then, that we ſtill find among us individuals, who, witneſſing thoſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful convulſions, and all the rage of civil diſcord and commotion abroad, ſeem, by their writings and declamatory vehemence, in and out of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain doors, to wiſh, to invite, and encourage an experiment of thoſe terrors, deſolation and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, the recital of which is ſhocking to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity? Why is it that a luſt of power, a ſelfiſh ambition, will labour to inſtigate, to inflame a giddy multitude? Why is it that men of abilities, of fortune, of rank, forgetting their quality, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the ſad tale of French maſſacre and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ever inſeparable from actual treaſon, aſſume the vile form of ſeditious declaimers, and re-echo the doctrines of inebriated Paine, and his ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Republicaniſm.</p>
            <p>Let me offer a word of advice to thoſe ſplendid reformers, the mendacious treachery of whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured writings is but too ſucceſsful a bait to an unthinking and too credulous multitude. They know well that the paſſions of the human heart hold cloſe correſpondence with each other; and the progreſs from one violent affection to another is often rapid and involuntary. If we give way to habits of approbation—to expreſſions of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe ſyſtems of proſcription and murder, which follow Revolutionary Government, our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe will operate gradually, ſo forcibly on our minds, that we imbibe the ſame cruel and unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentiments: while we are palliating the profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033947_0024_0FF9D0D9C6FE7760"/>vices, the wicked intrigues, the bloody plots of ſucceſſive factions in France, and urging ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar horrors among ourſelves, under the ſoft <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>But, however obſtinately a band of pretended patriots may attempt to palliate the motives of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid aſſaſſinations, and to perſuade the world, that the perpetrators of ſuch foul crimes were moved by juſt principles of liberty, to take thoſe bloody methods of avenging their wrongs:—However perverſely our p—y declaimers may endeavour, under colour of reform, to juſtify their unnatural predilection and propenſity for Gallic Revolution, I truſt they never will be able ſo far to impoſe upon the underſtanding and virtue of ſenſible and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting Britons.</p>
            <p>The laſt revolutionary writer, whoſe editions have been largely multiplied by magic proceſs, to dazzle the public eye, is the grand ſupporter of the chief of his party, and contends, by a mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of argument, as inſulting to the good ſenſe of Engliſhmen, as it is injurious to truth and fact, that Mr. Fox alone can adminiſter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at this time with effect. That is, the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of faction ſupports itſelf now, as it has always done, on the ſuppoſed incapacity of the preſent

Surely, if certain men have no method to ſupport a conſequence, but by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a cloud of doubt and embarraſſing gloom over the public mind, their procedure and aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated affiliation muſt appear ſolely directed to ſerve the purpoſes of a myſtery or craft againſt the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic welfare.</p>
            <p>Whoever contemplates, with philanthropic and Britiſh feelings, thoſe heats that are every day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in the very boſom of Society, from the enthuſiaſtic rancour that fills the pages of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-writers, muſt ſhudder at the conſequences; and muſt plainly ſee, that the moſt terrible events are to be averted only by introducing and diffuſing the ſalutary doctrines of truth and law, in oppoſition to ingenious falſhood; and by oppoſing the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of national virtue and the communication of national happineſs, to looſe and fanciful ſyſtems of innovation.</p>
            <p>The gentlemen-reformers, of ourday, have ſhewn themſelves acceſary to raiſing a ſpirit of turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. They have laboured to flatter the paſſions of the people, and by doing ſo, have induced a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033947_0026_0FF9D0EAF69B3B98"/>ſtrong ſuſpicion, that they are not averſe to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme reform, which is attainable only through the horrors of Revolution. I fear ſome are going far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and deeper, and regardleſs of any extremity, have united to calumniate the conduct, and blaſt the fair fame, the honeſt intentions of the preſent Miniſters, in order to appear the defenders of the people, and to caſt themſelves on the notice of the populace for their own aggrandizement. If there are any of this deſcription, who practiſe oppoſition to Britiſh Conſtitution, in favour on French Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm, I pray that ſuch may obtain the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their duplicity and evil-doings from the Juſtice of their Country.</p>
            <p>The preſent criſis is allowed to be alarming— The enemy, as ferocious and implacable, as they are active and prodigal of blood, threaten our ſhores—What then ſhould be the conduct of thoſe few firm aſſociates in oppoſition?—I will tell them in a few words of gratuitous counſel to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of "The Cauſe and Conſequences."—Ceaſe the cant of Reform.—There is a neceſſity at this time for the talents and exertions of all men.— Let a ſuſpenſion of oppoſition ſpring out of that neceſſity. Make that neceſſity habitual among all over whom you poſſeſs influence.—Give this happy turn to your powers, rouſe the indolent virtues of all within your ſphere of perſuaſion, by inſpiring them with that love of their country, which knows no party or diverſity of ſentiment when the ſtate is in danger.—Make the high term—UNANIMITY
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033947_0027_0FF9D0F1B61CE7C0"/>agitate the minds, and intereſt the hearts of all men, to ſtrive manfully together.—When Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters come forward with a ſtatement of their further wants for the public ſervice, at this momentous criſis, aid their propoſition and plans by advice beſt adapted to the occaſion.—Haſten to kindle an emulation of this kind in every town throughout the Kingdom—proclaim this honeſt truth, that parſimony in war is often productive of the moſt ſerious miſchiefs—and that when an enemy threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens our ſhores, our properties, our families, all that we hold dear,—the ſcale of expenſe ſhould be ample and co-extenſive with the neceſſity of the time.—Such a conduct will be truly political, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and liberal in its ſpirit, and will not fail to endear you to every man in the nation.</p>
            <p>Encourage by your zeal and example the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary enthuſiaſm ſpread abroad by the armed Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry, and Volunteer aſſociations. The military ardour which ſuch inſtitutions inſpire, has a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good effect, by connecting the public intereſt with an honeſt perſonal ambition, and by ſhewing the foe what reception they may expect from an armed and united people.</p>
            <p>You are too well verſed in law and politics, not to be ſenſible of this truth, that he who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours not to ſerve the State at an eventful period; who applies not his powers and abilities to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate advantage and glory of the nation, who acts not in every inſtance, as if animated with the wiſh to preſerve the Conſtitution of the country, can
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033947_0028_0FF9D10276C6E360"/>ſcarcely be ſuppoſed to be a member of that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, whoſe intereſt appear, as it were, foreign to him.</p>
            <p>The exertions of a great body of the people, which is the ſtamen of every ſtate, will be but ſlow and languid, while they can find in the clamours of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition a ſort of reaſon and excuſe for their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude and diſaffection.</p>
            <p>I have put before you a plain ſtatement, not obſcured by myſtery, or entangled by terms of art—and I ſhall only add, that while you boaſt your knowledge of the Rights of Man, you ought not to forget the duties of the individual.</p>
            <p>I ſhall hope ſoon to witneſs that noble prompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of ſpirit, that affectionate alacrity, that high policy of unanimity which diſdains niggardlineſs of purſe or of perſon, when the State calls for both— I hope to witneſs that liberality of conduct, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nly uniſon of ſentiment, which the <hi>Salus Populi</hi> imperiouſly demands; and which will eſtabliſh the public ſafety upon a rock, againſt which the winds and waves of French threats and French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion ſhall beat in vain.</p>
            <p>Should my eager hopes of ſuch an happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation fail, I think all men muſt be convinced more and more of the ſtrong truths uttered by one of the greateſt men in our age—that there is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant conſpiracy in this country. I will not point to the perſons moſt deeply, moſt ſeriouſly implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it. But it appears a conſpiracy of talents ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the luſt of power, caſting themſelves
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033947_0029_0FF9D1059144F5A0"/>on the vicious propenſities of the multitude; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, equally unprincipled and ſanguinary, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ferocious and cunning, as any plot of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſpierian faction in France.</p>
            <p>From this digreſſion againſt modern reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Gallic ſcholiaſts, and having ſettled curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the account with Mr. Paine, for his attacks againſt eſtabliſhed Governments and Religion, I now proceed to examine the character of that great and amiable man, whoſe former marks of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (while he appeared worthy of friendſhip) could not ſuffice to melt the heart of this tyger, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him from drenching the dagger of calumny in the admired character of his benefactor.</p>
            <p>It is a lamentable reflection on human nature, that ſo much ingratitude and baſeneſs is to be found in man.—When the American Fabius was cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his boſom, and conferring marks of favour on this miſcreant, he little thought he was warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the viper to turn againſt himſelf, and to emit his worſt poiſon upon his protector.—He little thought that the abilities which he encouraged in the writer of Common Senſe, would be made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to revolutionary ambition and French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue againſt America.—He little imagined that the pamphleteer Paine, a deſperate adventurer, without friends or fortune, ſhould riſe to be the greateſt monſter of wickedneſs that ever diſgraced humanity:—He dreamed not of giving his conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to a Journaliſt intriguer, an hypocritical vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, ready, under the baneful influence of mad
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033947_0030_0FF9D10C70ED96C8"/>enthuſiaſm and new philoſophy, to load his patron with falſhood and defamation:—But as he had juſt before abjured God, and reviled the holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of religion, what better return could be expected?</p>
            <p>It has ever been the wiſh and the labour of wiſe and good men, to lay up a ſtock of character and of reputable competence in life—for the purpoſe of the Poet—
<q>Senes ut in otia tuta recedant.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. Paine diſdains the common rules of life, and has ruſhed precipitately forward into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of turpitude and baſeneſs.</p>
            <p>What an awful leſſon to men in ſociety to find that there are amongſt them, thoſe who, riſing by fortuitous circumſtances from low ſituations, only become more furious in their purſuits, intractable and inſatiable in their ambition, and dark aſſaſſins of the very boſoms that gave them conſequence?</p>
            <p>Hiſtory records an individual, who, to attain the reputation of having atchieved the moſt ſplendidly atrocious act of conſummate villainy, ſet fire to the Temple of Diana, at Epheſus, and deſtroyed that <hi>chef-d'oeuvre</hi> of human ingenuity:—One of the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt monuments of art, as well for its magnitude and the loſtineſs of its architecture, as the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and excellence of the works of ſculpture, with which it was enriched by thoſe eminent artiſts who gave life to marble, if we may be allowed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſon: So, Tom Paine, emulous of the renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infamy of the Epheſian incendiary, not only la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033947_0031_0FF9D10FA6033B50"/>to ſpread the conflagration of anarchy and atheiſm over the world, and to overwhelm the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing fabric of Britiſh Conſtitution and Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can liberty, by the poiſonous effluvia of his perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious doctrines; but, as if ſomething was ſtill wanting to his public infamy, he opens his battery of ſlander upon the amiable Preſident of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States.—
<q>
                  <l>Quo non proeſtantior alter</l>
                  <l>pietate, virtute et meritis.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>However enormous and deſtructive the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ruſhing from the pen of Tom Paine, one would imagine, that he wanted to out-do himſelf in this atrocious Letter—It would in fact ſeem, that after many years labours happily unſucceſsful againſt Britain, he thought he ſhould more eaſily obtain the palm, the apex of infamy, by means equally ſhocking to honour and gratitude, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with truth and decency. What muſt be our opinion of the preſumption of an individual, known only by his crimes, who arrogantly arraigns the man to whom Europe has long ſince conceded the merit of conſummate wiſdom, the wreathe of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary merit, obtained by the exertion of abilities, and by the nobleſt inſtances of prudential caution and firmneſs. With petulant affection of military ſkill and criticiſm, this little <hi>Ingrate</hi> dares to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the campaigns of the American war, and to controvert thoſe brilliant and diſtinguiſhed traits of heroiſm, which Britiſh generals of long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:033947_0032_0FF9D11514AB2728"/>acknowledged with a kind of terriſic appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and which the great <hi>Frederic,</hi> who knew how to appreciate military exploits, confeſſed his ſurprize and admiration—If the old hero of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia expreſſed ſuch eſtimation for the commander, and glowed with love to the man;—If all Europe confeſſed the ſuperiority of American enterprize and exertion, amid a thouſand difficulties: If Waſhington eſtabliſhed a character that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver die, or be obſcured by the vapour of ſlander; If, by the moſt compaſſionate endearments and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs for his troops, in want of neceſſary cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtockings, and ſhoes, he was able to reconcile them to their diſtreſſes, to animate them in a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſeverance in the cauſe of their country: if his comprehenſive mind was able to defeat the beſt conſerted plans of his adverſaries in the field: If his wiſdom, fertile in expedients, was capable of forming the vaſt project of capturing a whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: If, by a variety of ſkilful manoeuvres, invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable ſecrecy, he concealed the magnitude of the undertaking, till the various combinations of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, of veſſels, and proviſions, were prepared to carry his plan into execution, by the moſt rapid and unexpected movements:—If ſuch military operations place a general in the moſt diſtinguiſhed point of view, ſurely all men muſt admire the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and conduct of the American commander in chief.</p>
            <p>Who, that reads the valedictory addreſſes of Gen. Waſhington to the people of America, can doubt the probity and excellence of the heart that dictated
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033947_0033_0FF9D11CAD430558"/>ſuch humane and benevolent ſentiments? Every Briton that in the war felt the courage of the hand that wrote it; every man that heard of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements of a Waſhington, muſt read, with a generous concern and regret, the farewel addreſs of an illuſtrious chief magiſtrate; who, after the labours of a difficult and ſucceſsful war; after the ſeverities of long and dangerous campaigns, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the bed of eaſe and domeſtic comfort, of whom the Americans may, with exultation, pronounce, in the words of Seneca—
<q>Unus cunctando, nobis reſtituit rem,</q>
to ſecure to his country the happy poſſeſſion and permanency of an eſtabliſhed government of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, internal harmony, and federal union.— Thus great and glorious to the end of his political career, how much muſt the grateful citizens of America, how much muſt poſterity, admire his long laborious ſervices, and unſullied virtue; and, to crown all, the ſteady attachment of his ſoul to his country's welfare, by his manly oppoſition to thoſe factious demagogues, who would riſk nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al happineſs for the accompliſhment of their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructive and flagitious deſigns in favour of Gallic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm. The valedictory addreſs of the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Waſhington, has made a ſerious and laſting impreſſion on the public mind in this country, as in America. In that honeſt plain production, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the abilities of the conſummate ſtateſman, the wiſdom of the juſt legiſlator, the affectionate advice of the parent, anxious for the welfare of his
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033947_0034_0FF9B9BC27E87610"/>children, and concerned for the aberrations and indiſcretions of a part of his family.—We diſcover the tender ſympathy of a mind anxious and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at an eventful criſis, to perform the utmoſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſervice to his country.—We admire that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent diſplay of political knowledge, in which he offers, with energy and freedom, his laſt advice towards preſerving that vigorous union and form of government, under which the country had proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered in wealth and commerce, the reins of which he was about to reſign into other hands.—He takes an ample ſurvey of the relative ſituation of America and Europe, and delineates the beauties and defects of the ſeveral component parts of the ſeveral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments.—He points out, with honeſt zeal and firmneſs, the ſhelves and rocks of diſunion, on which thoſe who have been at the helm of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring revolution have ran; and, with glowing pencil, paints the advantages of a political and commercial connection with England, as the palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of peace, liberty, and proſperity to America.</p>
            <p>It is an agreeable entertainment and conſolation for the great and comprehenſive mind of a Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, to look to the work of his hands.—He has raiſed an infant empire; he has brought numerous and diſcordant colonial intereſts into union and foederal harmony;—he has ſtood at the helm, till their defence has been compleated againſt all the inclemencies and ſtorms which agitate the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an continent;—he has witneſſed the rapid progreſs of improvement and ſeen the empire great in agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033947_0035_0FF9D124B7D8B508"/>flouriſhing in commerce, and directed by the well-regulated policy of peace with all the world. It is ſurely a rich repaſt for the mind of the wiſe and good to contemplate ſuch a picture—here we can furniſh our minds with true ideas of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and deformity, when we ſee one man thus great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contributing to the happineſs of the whole, by a conduct formed on prineiples of wiſdom and virtue, which never fail to render individuals, as well as communities, happy and proſperous.</p>
            <p>And why is it that Mr. Paine emits his bile in ſuch quantity, and labours to aſſail the character and conduct of one of the worthieſt and beſt of men?</p>
            <p>It is becauſe the great and revered Waſhington wiſhes to avert the pernicious and peſtilential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of Gallic incendiaries from the peaceful ſhores of America.—It is, becauſe he has had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to diſcover that ſelfiſhneſs and violence in the Councils of France, which would eſtabliſh its power on the ruins, and at the expenſe of others; that would ſacrifice the intereſts of its neareſt allies to public plunder and devaſtation.</p>
            <p>It is becauſe he ſees in the conduct of the French leaders, an encouragement of anarchy in other ſtates, and a deſire of revolutionizing other Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ambition and avarice point the way.— It is becauſe, inſtead of conſtitutional harmony and union for the public good, mutual hatred and mutual diſtruſt ſtill agitate their councils; faction
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033947_0036_0FF9B9C2932D39B8"/>is plotting againſt faction: and party-marks and party names point the dagger of the aſſaſſin night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the public ſtreets.</p>
            <p>It is becauſe the enlightened Stateſman have reprobated, in forcible terms, the multitude of European ruffians and agitators, who have ſpread themſelves throughout the ſtates, poiſoning the public mind with foul calumnies, and preaching the doctrines of commotion and diſcord.—</p>
            <p>Away, then, vile Paine! hide thy infamous head in merited obſcurity! nor attempt again to ſully the virgin paper with they corrupt gall. Thy writings ſmell ſtrongly of the eructations of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs; and like ſtinkpots, are ſolely remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their peſtiferous odours.</p>
            <p>But it is reported the abuſive letter to General Waſhington is the work of dire neceſſity, to gain a pittance of favour from the Directory, even on the ground of hunger, and pecuniary diſtreſs: how low and degraded muſt that man's feelings be, who would ſtoop to ſuch ſervile adulation, and Judas-like, ſell his benefactor for a few pieces of ſilver?</p>
            <q>
               <l>Quid non mortalia pectora cogis</l>
               <l>Auri ſacra fames!</l>
            </q>
            <p>The late ſtrange behaviour and threats of the French, point out more clearly the true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and policy of that nation.—It is plainly conformable to their general views, of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddling in every government, and engroſſing an influence in every country; and as this cannot
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:033947_0037_0FF9BAC335A9A7D8"/>be done on principles of trade or equity, they regard not the method, provided they can ſucceed in their darling ſchemes. The inſolence of the French Envoy in America,—his buſy, reſtleſs, nay, factious interference, is not diſowned, but defended by the Directory; inſtead of calling him back in diſgrace to Europe, to ſuffer for his atrocious offence againſt the laws of America, and of nations, they countenance his intrigues, and vindicate his arrogance, againſt all principles of political juſtice and plomatic faith.</p>
            <p>Happily, indeed, theſe intriguing manoeuvres have given to the Americans no favourable idea of their pretended friends: the French have been long developing their true character even in America,—but never before dared to ſpeak in ſo outrageous a manner with regard to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs: and Tom Paine has the daring to echo their vengeful animadverſions on the public coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of America.—The bold cant of Paine, the common topic of the Paris coffee-houſe politicians is daily this—"Did not France purchaſe with the blood of her ſubjects the independence of America, and the ſecurity ſhe enjoys? Did not France ſnatch them from the trammels of Britain, by coming to their aid, when they were at the alternative of unconditional ſubmiſſion? Did not France do all this for America?"—I deny the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. France fought not for America,—ſhe fought in America, and with the aid and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of America, againſt Great-Britain, ſhe little
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033947_0038_0FF9D12FD0298708"/>regarded America,—the depreſſion of England was the object.—She ſought from America a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of the moſt advantageous branches of her commerce, in order to deprive the Engliſh of all intercourſe and ſhare in the trade of that great Continent.—She fettered America with reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive clauſes reſpecting a Navy, and preſcribed regulations in the Weſt-India trade, totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with friendſhip and protection. She now proceeds to criminate the public act and terms of a treaty made by two independent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with a reciprocal relation to their great commercial intereſts, and encourages to inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the enthuſiaſtic rancour of a little Gallic fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a few towns of the Continent.</p>
            <p>Are theſe the tranſactions of friendſhip? Are theſe the ſuggeſtions of ſound policy? I will only remark on this ſubject, that the honour of Great-Britain and America, as powerful independent States, is concerned in procuring full and ample juſtice for ſuch hoſtile intrigues—otherwiſe Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica may expect, the firſt opportunity, to ſee the ſequel, to the overthrow of the Netherlands, and to the ſubjugation of Holland.</p>
            <p>Let France then conſider what ſhe has to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from ſuch a friend as Paine? Let French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men judge whether ſuch a man, in caſe he could accompliſh the ruin of his native country, and an inſurrection in America would not extend his nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious views further, and in order to conſummate the character of infamy, ſeek to continue and to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033947_0039_0FF9B9D2525B8238"/>multiply thoſe calamities into which France has been plunged for years paſt.</p>
            <p>But Providence, which hath lately ſo eminently defeated the projects of this inſidious pamphleteer, and which has recently humbled the pride of our open enemy, by defeating their boaſted invaſion, will ſtill manifeſt its goodneſs by throwing ſhame on the evil doing of the arch-fiend Paine. We muſt hope, that by its aſſiſtance, England and America, now combined in mutual relations of commerce and proſperity, will defend themſelves ſucceſsfully againſt the league formed for their injury and ruin, by the inſinuations and intrigues of French emiſſaries. All the efforts of a ſuborned Paine, cannot prevent the moſt diſtant poſterity from acknowledging General Waſhington to have been the defender of the liberties of America againſt the ſecret agency of French counſels and French gold.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſaid, that Mr. Paine has, by ſome ſoul means or other, got into his hands a ring belonging to the unfortunate Queen of France, the motto is, <hi>En Dien mon eſperance</hi>—After his liberation from priſon, ſome friend aſked him, if he had ſaved his ring? oh yes; here it is, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed— "Mais au Diable l'eſperance en Dieu—The miſcreant was then pregnant with thoſe pages of impiety and profanation, to which he afterwards gave a hideous birth.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But while we offer the merited tribute of praiſe to the illuſtrious Waſhington, let us rejoice in making a juſt application at home—Let us ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider the duty we owe to our beloved Monarch, who is the inſtrument in the hands of Providence to preſerve us from the horrors of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033947_0040_0FF9D136AEED1B78"/>and revolutionary equality. While irreligion and pernicious doctrines are abroad, conſcience, gratitude, and even ſelf-love ſhould prompt us to ſupport the dignity of the Crown, and to co-operate, by every means in our power, to maintain the cauſe of pure religion and virtue; of juſt government and regulated liberty, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to thoſe fanciful ſchemes, and innovating ſyſtems, which ravage and deſolate a once-flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and civilized country.</p>
            <p>To conclude—and happily the argument is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to the Government of thoſe kingdoms, as to America—The merit of a wiſe and proſperous Adminiſtration muſt certainly redound to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the perſonage, who is placed at the head of affairs. The divine prerogative of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating happineſs and glory to a great and numerous people, of nouriſhing them "with a true and faithful heart, and ruling them prudently with all his powers," muſt ſurely fill the mind of the chief magiſtrate with conſcious ſatisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the general utility is to the people; and, however he may partake of their felicity, the difficulty, the diſquietude, the conſtant care lie upon the perſon, who adminiſters the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Every conſiderate man muſt be ſenſible of the weight of the reins of Government, and every honeſt man, far from oppoſing, will endeavour to ſupport the hand that bears it. To be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the connexions and dependencies of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;

Solid principles of wiſdom, enlarged views, a diſcerning ſpirit, ſtrength and preſence of mind, with conſtant application and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are required to keep the ſources pure, from which ſlow the benefits of civil Government and Order.</p>
            <p>It is the purpoſe of Providence, that the Chief Magiſtrate ſhould bear the weight of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in order that the ſubjects may live eaſy under it.—He avails himſelf of his prerogative to reſiſt the machinations of turbulent ſpirits; and exerts his powers to act up to the glory and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the people, that their ſecurity, tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and happineſs, may be ſettled, ſtrengthened, and eſtabliſhed, beyond the reach of diſaffection and malice from within, and of invaſion from abroad.</p>
            <p>In a word, when we look to the wiſdom of our preſent councils, to the vigour of our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—with a force of well diſciplined troops to guard our coaſts, and an additional body of brave and loyal men, training to arms, to be ready, on an emergency, to go out in defence of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and families: When we behold Miniſters
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033947_0042_0FF9D141B553E2D0"/>employed in giving ſuch ſubſtantial and permanent ſecurity to the country, as will put it out of the power of the foe to injure us to any extent, I humbly think that, inſtead of yielding to the gloom of diſquietude or deſpondency, we ought to look up to our danger with life and ſpirit, and without any of thoſe apprehenſions, which pervade too many at this time.</p>
            <p>Our various operations, it muſt be owned, are attended with great, very great expenſes:—But which is the man that will not acknowledge, 'tis better to make our utmoſt efforts, by money and men, to avert a threatened danger, than to ſink into a ſtate of apathy, or puſillanimity at an ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moment, and endanger the public ſafety by a cowardly parſimony and degenerate niggardlineſs.</p>
            <p>Rouſe, then, Britons—re-aſſume your wonted ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit—do not think it ſo eaſy a thing, to run upon our coaſts, and make a deſcent of any magnitude on armed ſhores. The abilities, the wiſdom, the vigilance of Miniſters are directed to the proper points of national utility;—and whatever may be the demands for the exigencies of the war, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, you will eventually have a good account of your millions, by the defeat of the enemy's mad projects, and by a final happy iſſue to the war.</p>
