            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>A man ſhall be commended according to his wiſdom.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS proverb ſtates to us, not only what ought to take place, but what commonly does take place in the affairs of men. A man receives praiſes and honours in a meaſure proportioned to the powers of his mind, the knowledge he has acquired, and the diſcreet uſe which he makes of his reaſon and talents. Poſſibly, in ſome inſtances, commendation may not, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, ſucceed the exerciſes of wiſdom and knowledge; but, in proceſs of time, a man's talents and wiſdom ſhall be duly acknowledged, and celebrated. Theſe praiſes are the more valuable, as they are the natural and juſt reward of eminent and profitable attainments.</p>
            <p>What I teſtify, in ſuch ſtrong terms, of the ſuperior excellency and dignity of wiſdom, you will not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehend, nor miſtake my words, as though by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I intended the mere ſtrength of a man's intellect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual powers aided and improved by ſcience and literature. This is obvious, that a man of great original genius and of greater acquired talents in the arts and ſciences, may ſtill be a man void of underſtanding and diſcretion, and to be reprobated for his folly and perverſeneſs, in the miſapplication of his powers and attainments.</p>
            <p>Wiſdom is a moral virtue: It implies a diſpoſition to turn our diſcoveries to beneficial purpoſes; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the intereſts of others, and the purity of our own hearts. Knowledge uſefully employed, is alone entitled
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035750_0006_10066395A4E720D8"/>
to the name of wiſdom, and is eſſential to the exiſtence of it. Wiſdom is the knowledge of what is fitting and beſt to be done under exiſting relations and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It is the diſcovery of the <hi>fit</hi> and the <hi>uſeful,</hi> and the avoiding of the <hi>unſuitable</hi> and <hi>injurious.</hi> Wiſdom is ever attended with ſingular advantages, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, how to obtain it, ought to be among our firſt, and moſt ſolicitious enquiries.</p>
            <p>I am, at this time, to give you a lecture upon wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The occaſion calls your attention to this ſubject. Happy ſhould I be, could I place it to your view, in an advantageous, and inviting point of light. What is wanting, in the execution, your candour will excuſe, and your own reflections ſupply.</p>
            <p>Wiſdom, is a lucrative and profitable attainment. The man, who, among imperfect men, poſſeſſed the greateſt ſhare of wiſdom, and well knew its advantages, has left this teſtimony in its favour.
<q>Happy is the man that findeth wiſdom, and the man that getteth underſtanding. For the merchandize of it is better than the merchandize of ſilver, and the gain thereof, than fine gold. She is more precious than rubies: And all the things thou canſt deſire, are not to be compared unto her. Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs and all her paths are peace. She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy is every one that retaineth her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee men purſuing enjoyment, in amaſſing ſilver and gold, and rubies; in acquiring titles, honours, and ſtations of rank and power; ſeeking happineſs in bodily health, and length of days, in the indulgence of pleaſure, and the gay ſcenes of amuſement. Solomon tried all theſe various methods of happineſs. But, what was the reſult of his experiments? It was, that wiſdom and underſtanding poſſeſs all the advantages to be obtained by thoſe other acquiſitions, without any of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035750_0007_1006639743031E40"/>
evils. Wiſdom ſecures the deſired end of human happineſs, while other purſuits are empty and fruitleſs. Wiſdom is the only mean to ſecure that en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>joyment, which is the perpetual object of human deſire. Wiſdom is better than ſtrength, beauty, and comely proportion; than health, long life, amuſement and pleaſure: It is better than monies, lands, mortgages and obligations; than rich trappings and ſplendid wardrobes: It is better than victories and triumphs; than titles, honours, thrones.
<q>Wiſdom is the principal thing, therefore get wiſdom, and with all thy getting, get underſtanding. Exalt her, and ſhe ſhall promote thee; ſhe ſhall bring thee to honour when thou doſt embrace her. She ſhall give to thine head an ornament of grace; a crown of glory ſhall ſhe deliver to thee.</q>
Thou ſhalt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended according to thy wiſdom.</p>
            <p>And why ſhall men be commended according to their wiſdom? For this ſimple reaſon, <hi>that wiſdom ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders men uſeful.</hi> Wiſdom is an operative virtue, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the moſt ſalutary effects. Nothing is important, or valuable, in the character of man, which does not render him beneficial to others, either by his example, or by his labours. Wiſdom, is the qualification, which enables us to ſubſerve the intereſts and happineſs of our fellow men.</p>
            <p>Ignorance and folly, render one inſignificant and contemptible, becauſe he is unprofitable and incapable of advancing thoſe uſeful deſigns and enterprizes, on which reſt the happineſs and glory of ſociety. He knows not how to chooſe, he is not diſpoſed to purſue meaſures for the common good.
<q>Wiſdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkneſs,</q>
for
<q>the wiſe man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walketh in darkneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The man of wiſdom contemplates his various rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſtudies and learns his own powers; and applies
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035750_0008_1006639A5111C040"/>
thoſe powers to the improvement and well being of his connections and aſſociates. As it is his wiſh to ſee others in an eligible and proſperous ſituation, ſo he has the means and capacity of ameliorating their condition, of aſſuaging the griefs and augmenting the joys of human life. The higher are his attainments in ſcience and wiſdom, the more extenſive are thoſe effects which benefit human ſociety.</p>
            <p>To the wiſe man, muſt we look for thoſe inſtances of moderation, ſelf government, chaſtity, purity, ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, placability, and munificence, which exhibit man the example, the ornament, and the admiration of the world. Wiſdom teaches to ſubdue unruly paſſions and moderate inordinate deſires. This marks the wide diſtinction between a continent refined Scipio, and a ferocious brutal Alexander. This diſcriminates the humane Patriot and Saviour of his country, from the unfeeling conqueror and butcher of his fellow men. This ſtamps with glory an ADAMS, a WASHINGTON; while folly and madneſs ſtain with infamy a French Directory.</p>
            <p>Do the virtuous of every age and country, read with delight the hiſtory of Joſeph? Do they propound his example for the imitation of their children and youth? Wiſdom has enrolled his name among the worthies of our race, and ſtamped his reputation with deathleſs fame. Was it, that he was the ſon of his old age, that Jacob loved him? No, it was becauſe, as our tranſlation ſhould have copied it from the original Hebrew, "He was as wiſe as a Senator." His ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior wiſdom excited the groveling and implacable envy of his fooliſh and froward brethren to plunge him into the horrible pit: But the diſcerning eye of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence raiſed him thence, exalted him to honour and glory, and led him into Egypt, to ſave much people alive. A foreſeeing and faithful mind, reſcued him from the lewd enticements of an inſidious harlot, event<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035750_0009_1006639D48D3FAB0"/>
ſet him in the ſecond chariot of the kingdom, made him a father unto Pharaoh, and the deliverer of God's famiſhing heritage.</p>
            <p>The omniſcient mind, foreſeeing the future meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, fidelity, and wiſdom, of his ſervant Moſes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him for the great and eminent ſervices to which he was afterwards raiſed; plucked him from that deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which he lay expoſed, in the fens, and among the Crocodiles of Egypt; placed him in the houſe of the devout and pious Jochebed, to be inſtructed in the ſublime truths of the Hebrew faith; and removed him in maturer age, to the court of Pharaoh, that he might be acquainted with all thoſe arts and ſciences, for which, the Egyptians were then ſo famous. Thus was he furniſhed with a knowledge of the ſublime doctrines of the true religion, and was deeply verſed in all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of human ſcience. He was
<q>Learned in all the wiſdom of Egypt, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</q>
Thus, by the foſtering care of his parents, and the attending bleſſing of heaven, Moſes, in proceſs of time, was magnified as one of the moſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and uſeful characters in the page of hiſtory.
<q>And there aroſe not a prophet ſince, in Iſrael, like unto Moſes, whom the Lord knew face to face: In all the ſigns and wonders, which the Lord ſent him to do, in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his ſervants, and to all his land: And in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moſes ſhewed in the ſight of all Iſrael.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What but unparelleled wiſdom, ſpread abroad the fame of Solomon, into all lands? Princes, from the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt parts of the earth, came to ſee and to hear his wiſdom. His own happy ſubjects ſubmitted themſelves to him with emulous duty, and grateful love, when they perceived,
<q>That the wiſdom of God was in him to do judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:035750_0010_1006639F0F85C140"/>Why was St. Paul exalted to a diſtinction and eminence, ſuperior to all the bleſſed Apoſtles of the holy Jeſus? Why was the greater part of the chriſtian ſcriptures the production of his pen? Why are his acts and labours peculiarly noticed and celebrated in the inſpired oracles? He was crowned with theſe honours, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that unſual ſtrength of mind, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined education, which were ſuperadded to his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary purity, and his ardent love to Chriſt. His uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and of courſe, his reputation, were abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed by the force of his genius, and his learned education in the ſchools of Greece, and at the feet of Gamaliel.</p>
            <p>But moſt of all, let our recollection dwell upon the example of the HOLY CHILD JESUS. This was the glory of his infant years, that, as he grew,
<q>He waxed ſtrong in ſpirit, filled with wiſdom, and the grace of God was upon him.</q>
So diligent was he to improve and enlarge his mind with truth, that at twelve years of age, he confounded and put to ſilence, all the learned ſcribes and diſputers of the Jewiſh temple. When he manifeſted himſelf the inſtructor of a periſhing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded world, all men marvelled at his doctrines, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "Whence hath this man this wiſdom?" And they teſtified of him, "Never man ſpake like this man." This was the glory of Chriſt, that he knew how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, and was wiſe and faithful to accompliſh the works of human happineſs and ſalvation; that work which his Father had given him to do. For his wiſdom and integrity, in the execution of his truſt, God has highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name which is named in earth or in heaven: He has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all the angels of God to worſhip him, and to honour the Son even as they honour the Father.</p>
            <p>In theſe illuſtrious patterns, now ſet to view, you perceive the beneficial effects, you approve the praiſes of wiſdom. Are you her progeny? You will cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035750_0011_100663A0942FB598"/>
her praiſes—"For wiſdom is juſtified of her c<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>dren." Do you emulate the glories of the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the reformers, the benefactors, and the ſaviours of the world? Write after their copy and you ſhall participate their fame. Apply your minds to knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge; ſtudy to be uſeful, and you ſhall, ultimately, wear an unfading crown. You ſhall erect to your memories, a monument more durable than braſs, a monument which ſhall outlive the ravages of time.</p>
            <p>Do I perceive your minds enflamed with the love of wiſdom? Do you appreciate its worth? Do you wiſh to poſſeſs this more than golden treaſure? Let me, in a curſory and partial manner, point the way in which you may ſecure this ineſtimable prize.</p>
            <p>Would you acquire a wiſe and an underſtanding heart? Then duly eſtimate your noble part, your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and immortal mind. This is the dignity of your natures, the ethereal breath of your omniſcient creator. By this are you enabled to think—to reaſon —to judge—to act a part worthy of rational, moral, and ſpiritual agents. That attention which too many pay to the mortal body, you muſt pay to the immortal mind.</p>
            <p>Reſpect yourſelves as rational beings, fitted for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual</hi> purſuits and <hi>angelic</hi> happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To know ourſelves,</hi> is an eſſential branch of wiſdom. Without this knowledge, the higheſt attainments in the arts and ſciences, will leave us in a ſtate of deplorable weakneſs and folly. Man can never be wiſe, unleſs he knows his own powers, and for what purſuits his genius and ſituation in life beſt fit him. He has made a happy diſcovery, who has learned the tendency and force of his own mind, and for what employments in life, the Author of his being has prepared him.</p>
            <p>But this diſcovery is not enough. He muſt cultivate and ſtrengthen his powers by ſtudy and exerciſe. We learn moſt rapidly in the ſchool of experience. The
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035750_0012_100663A4131E7090"/>
man, who ſeldom awakes his mind, by energetic exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who lets his talents ruſt in idleneſs, is like Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſleeping in the lap of Delilah. Rouſed, by exertion, the mind feels its ſtrength; brightened, by exerciſe, it knows how to direct its force to the beſt advantage.</p>
            <p>Having diſcovered in what line we can be muſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, prudence will direct us to purſue that line: And by application to it, we ſhall not fail of gaining a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtinction, and of being highly uſeful to all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly, you modeſtly think, that you are deſtined to the inferior attainments of knowledge; to walk in the lower ſteps of wiſdom? But this, in you, may be falſe modeſty. You have not, duly conſidered, to what lofty heights, you may ariſe, by a courſe of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, perſeverance and enterprize. "<hi>Nil deſperandum" To deſpair of nothing,</hi> ſhould be the motto of thoſe who aſpire after wiſdom. Prodigies of learning and wiſdom have emerged from ſmall and unpromiſing beginnings.</p>
            <p>Fortitude, an inflexible reſolution of mind, are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the acquiſition of eminent degrees of knowledge. Be not afraid of the labour and expenſe of getting wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. It was a proverb of the ancients, "<hi>Veritas in puteo" Truth is in the bottom of a well.</hi> You muſt draw it out, with labour and perſeverance. Solomon gives a ſanction to this proverb, when he tells us, that to get wiſdom, we muſt <hi>ſearch for her as for ſilver, and dig for her as for hidden treaſure.</hi> The lazy man, the ſlothful ſoul, can never be repleniſhed with truth and knowledge.</p>
            <p>Not only induſtry, but order and method are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requiſite in the purſuit of wiſdom. We muſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganize and arrange our ſtudies, and turn our minds upon ſubjects in their due order, and according to their importance, or we muſt deſpair of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>To one who aſked that great ſtateſman, penſionary Dewitt, <hi>How he performed ſo much buſineſs in ſo ſhort a period?</hi> He replied, <hi>by doing one thing at a time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:035750_0013_100663A6F9C43D10"/>Be always doing: Study method and order; loſe no opportunity; keep ſtrait forward, and you will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed at your own progreſs. You will leave hurry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, buſtling, wandering travellers, far behind.</p>
            <p>But let us, always, recollect the diſtinction between a purſuit of wiſdom and the purſuit of knowledge. To improve and enlarge our minds, that we may be uſeful and do good to others, is the purſuit of wiſdom. But he purſues knowledge, only, who ſtudies for amuſement, and ſeeks thoſe ſhowy parts of learning, by which, he may make a blaze, and dazzle the eyes of gaping, ill judging, ſpectators. But, if you know yourſelves, your talents, your opportunities, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and redeem your time from unprofitable ſtudies, and from enervating indolence, and apply all your diſcoveries to ſome good account, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and felicity of God's creatures, then do you ſeek, then ſhall you attain to true and ſaving wiſdom. For this end, no part of human ſcience is to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, by which the purpoſe of doing good may be promoted. The art of becoming great and eminent, is, by gaining practical knowledge, the knowledge of doing to others the moſt extenſive benefits.</p>
            <p>Our perſonal applications to ſtudy and literature, ſhould be in order to qualify ourſelves for uſefulneſs. Every effort we make, to advance uſeful knowledge in ſociety, is a mark, no leſs of our wiſdom, than of our benevolence.</p>
            <p>The object of parents, in the education of children, is to enlarge their minds, and direct them into ſuch a train of reaſoning, and to inſpire them with ſuch bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſentiments, as will beſt fit them for the active em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of doing good. To ſtore their minds with uſeful ideas, and practical ſentiments, is to leave them the beſt legacy in a parent's gift.</p>
            <p>All inſtitutions of learning, are to be foſtered and encouraged, as they lay the foundations, in the minds
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035750_0014_100663A885E70068"/>
of youth, of future uſefulneſs. What youth acquire, in this way, will be a durable inheritance, when wealth and titles decay. While parents ſleep in the duſt, the precious fruits of their care and foreſight, in the good inſtruction of their children, will be taſted by ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generations.</p>
            <p>As, knowledge is eſſential to wiſdom, and the arts and ſciences are handmaids to virtue, and give energy and ſucceſs to the feelings of benevolence, ſo, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too aſſiduous in acquiring knowledge for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or in promoting it among thoſe with whom we are connected in ſociety; eſpecially among the youth, the riſing hope of our country. Is he to be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who drinks deep at the fountain of knowledge? How much more worthy of our admiration and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is he, who liberally deviſes the ways and means of diſſeminating ſcience and wiſdom, among our numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous youth of both ſexes? He makes proviſion, not only, that the Fathers, but, that the future Mothers of our race, may be richly furniſhed to train up their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to learning and virtue, and to become the Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, and Pauls, the Moſeſes, and Solomons, of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages.</p>
            <p>In pleaſing anticipation of theſe future benefits to community, do I, now, gratefully, diſcharge the duties of my appointment, in making an honourable mention of the laudable zeal, of thoſe worthy citizens of <hi>Deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> who have made ſuch copious ſubſcriptions, and donations, for the purpoſe of eſtabliſhing a ſeminary of learning in this place. In aid of their noble exertions, and in anſwer to their petitions, the Legiſlature of this Commonwealth, have granted a charter of ample privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges for the eſtabliſhment of an Academy, by the name of DEERFIELD ACADEMY; and have endowed it with a valuable tract of land, for the encouragement and ſupport of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:035750_0015_100663AA1EEC90A0"/>The gentlemen, who, by the act of incorporation, are entruſted with the intereſts and government of the Academy, have been enabled, by the munificence and energies of the friends of ſcience, to erect an elegant building, for the accommodation of thoſe numerous youths, who may wiſh to tread the paths of truth and virtue, and qualify themſelves for future ſervice in church and ſtate. The Truſtees have been mindful of that ſacred depoſit, which the bounty of individuals and of the public, have placed in their hands. They have been diligent to accompliſh the wiſhes and expectations of the public and of individuals.</p>
            <p>Having completed the academic edifice, they have procured an inſtructor, for the education of thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and youth of both ſexes, who may be committed to his care. Having received ample teſtimonials of the literary and moral character of this inſtructor, the Truſtees do, this day, with auſpicious hopes, preſent him to the public, <hi>the firſt Preceptor of Deerfield Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> As occaſions may require, other able and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inſtructors, will be provided for teaching the uſeful branches of knowledge, and leading the youthful mind to wiſdom and happineſs.</p>
            <p>In this the Truſtees are happy, that their wiſhes for the proſperity of the inſtitution are anticipated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. By the liberality of ſeveral private donors, the foundation of a Library is already laid, which they wiſh to ſee increaſed by additional favours from muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent and enlarged minds. The improvement of the pupils, would, in this way, be abundantly increaſed, and the intereſts of literature greatly promoted.</p>
            <p>A ſurpriſing progreſs, for ſo ſhort a period, has been made, in the collection of rare and valuable curioſities into the Muſeum of the Academy, where the minds of the inquiſitive and philoſophical, may be luxuriouſly fed, in contemplating the productions of nature and art.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:035750_0016_100663AF3524C838"/>Nor have the friends of ſcience and humanity, been unmindful of the advantages of endowing the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a ſuitable apparatus, for aiding the enquiries of naturaliſts and philoſophers, and for promoting the knowledge of the pupils, in the more ſublime parts of learning. Proviſion is made for valuable additions to the preſent ſmall beginnings of this infant inſtitution.</p>
            <p>The gentlemen of the Truſt, are deeply impreſſed with a feeling and grateful ſenſe of their high obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Mr. DAVID WELLS<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Greenfield, Deacon JONATHAN ARMS, and Mrs. ABIGAIL NORTON, for their munificient donations to the Academy, for the purpoſe of procuring a philoſophical apparatus. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing years ſhall celebrate this liberality and largeneſs of heart. Future generations ſhall reap the harveſt of their bounty.—And new patrons of this happy inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall emulate their virtues.</p>
            <p>It is, with pleaſing confidence expected, that the friends of freedom, of order, of ſcience, and of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, will be the friends of Deerfield Academy. It will be the care and felicity of the Truſtees, to merit the approbation and encouragement of ſuch worthy patrons. They will labour to improve, with oeconomy, the revenues of the corporation—to impart to youth its many privileges and advantages—to provide inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who, by example<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and teaching, ſhall advance the intereſts of learning—of liberty—of ſocial order—of wiſdom—of virtue—and of chriſtianity. They will, humbly, endeavour, when they ſhall be called off, from this honourable ſervice, that this truſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to faithful men. That their labours may be animated, may be wiſely directly, and happily ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may a gracious God give to his ſervants, wiſe and underſtanding hearts. May the Almighty Ruler of the Univerſe, ever have the Academy, its officers and members, in his holy keeping.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:035750_0017_100663B0BB8457E8"/>To draw to a cloſe, may this reſpectable aſſembly, who now worſhip God in this houſe of prayer, and honor the cauſe of literature, by their preſence, at the conſecration of the Academy, to the purpoſes of knowledge and virtue, duly, appreciate their privileges, in this land of liberty, of light, and of chriſtian knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge. May they cultivate their own minds with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and virtue.</p>
            <p>Would you, my hearers, be uſeful in time, and wiſe for eternity? Let me, laſt of all, and moſt of all, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to go to the Babe of Bethlehem, and learn of him, who was meek and lowly, and you ſhall find reſt to your ſouls. Go without the gates of Jeruſalem, and ſet under his croſs, where he bore your ſhame and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated your guilt. There, while you hear the tongues of ſcoffing wits, and blaſpheming infidels, deride the doctrines and inſult the griefs of your dying Redeemer, you ſhall be compelled, in admiration of the myſtery of eternal wiſdom, to cry out, "Truly, this man was the Son of God." In that Croſs, which was to the Jews, a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks, fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you ſhall ſee and adore the wiſdom of God, and the power of God to your ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Do you realize a careleſs inattention to the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truths? Do you feel yourſelves periſhing in your ſins? Do you perceive the dark glooms of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, and the hopeleſs deſpair of modern philoſophy? Do doubts and perplexities accompany your meditations upon the grave? Is all beyond conjecture and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty? Look to the ſufferer on Calvary; enter the tomb of Joſeph, of Arimathea; hear the earthquake, uſhering in the Reſurrection of Jeſus; go to Olivet; ſtand gazing up to heaven, until you ſee the aſcending Jeſus, received out of your ſight. Theſe ſcenes ſhall pluck the ſcales from your eyes; ſhall diſpel your doubts; ſhall ſilence your fears; ſhall fill you with joy

unſpeakable and full of glory.—For by him, who hath died and riſen again,
<q>Life and Immortality are brought to light.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With what more ſalutary exhortation can I conclude this diſcourſe,
<q>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him aſk of God, that giveth to all men, liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him. Take faſt hold of inſtruction, let her not go; keep her, for ſhe is thy life.</q>

            <p>WE have now, under the ſmiles of divine providence, arrived to a period which we have been anticipating with pleaſure, when we have an opportunity to dedicate this Academy, to the literary and virtuous purpoſes, for which it has been erected.—Upon this occaſion, in the name of the Truſtees, I commit to you, Mr. BROWN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON, the key of the Academy, and office of Preceptor. And you, ſir, being thus introduced into this ſeminary, in its infancy, to begin the rearing and improvement of it, your ſituation is of conſequence, to yourſelf, to the Pupils, and many others. Upon your exertions and ſucceſs, as a preceptor, we conceive the future en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and proſperity of this inſtitution, much depend. It is our ardent wiſh, that you may fulfil the pleaſing expectations which ariſe from the character, under which you come recommended, in teaching and governing the children and youth committed to your care, and in forming their minds and manners; and under your foſtering hand, with the aid and patronage of others, may this inſtitution flouriſh, and for many years to come, afford thoſe means of inſtruction which ſhall be highly beneficial to individuals, and eventually, to the public.</p>
