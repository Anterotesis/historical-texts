            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>I CORINTHIANS, III. 11.</bibl>
                  <p>FOR OTHER FOUNDATION CAN NO MAN LAY, THAN THAT IS LAID, WHICH IS JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>EVERY man, who has any ſenſe of the value of his ſoul, and any regard to its eternal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, muſt be convinced of the neceſſity of ſome ſure and certain foundation, for peace, comfort, and hope, with reſpect to his future ſtate: The ſoul is ſo precious, that nothing can be a proper founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for hope concerning its ſalvation, but one that is firm and ſtedfaſt, one that is laid by GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, one that will endure the ſevereſt trials, and that will ſtand when every thing elſe will fall. He is repreſented as a fooliſh man, who built his houſe on the ſand; but he is called wiſe, who built upon the Rock, and that Rock is CHRIST.</p>
            <p>It is alſo a matter of great importance, that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſhould learn to diſtinguiſh between the true ground of hope, and every thing elſe which has any connexion with it, or dependence upon it: For want of this, many a true Chriſtian has been ſubject to great uneaſineſs of mind, and has deprived him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of much comfort, which he might have enjoyed,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024089_0004_0FC331E7C94C6AB8"/>
if he had had a clear and diſtinct idea of what he ought ſolely to build upon. We are very apt to miſtake the <hi>evidences</hi> of our intereſt in CHRIST, for the <hi>foundation</hi> of our hope; and becauſe we ſee much imperfection in the evidences, we are apt to think there is imperfection in the foundation: Whereas the foundation is perfect, while the ſuperſtructure is very defective; and by a due attention to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, we might enjoy great comfort and peace of mind, even when our evidences are very dark and perplexed.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle in our context, compares Chriſtians to a building, "YE are GOD's building," the foundation of which is JESUS CHRIST. "Every man" is building on this foundation; but the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's direction is, "Let every man take heed <hi>how</hi> he builds thereon." The foundation is the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant part: There is but one, and no man can lay another, that will ſtand. When he has begun on the true foundation, then let him take heed how he builds; for there are precious and vile materials, which, imperfect as we are, we are very apt to blend together. There are "gold, ſilver and precious ſtones," by which are meant divine truths in the heart, forming the graces and virtues of the Chriſtian character, the genuine fruits of faith and acts of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the goſpel. And there are "wood, hay and ſtubble," by which are meant falſe notions, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided zeal, and erroneous conduct in religion, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, enthuſiaſm and human infirmity. Theſe things are too often mixed with the genuine fruits of religion, even in thoſe whom we have reaſon to hope are true Chriſtians. But there is a day coming when "every man's work will be tried as with fire," then theſe imperfect and corrupt mixtures will be
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024089_0005_0FC331EB4FA48C10"/>
burnt, and the man who had them will ſuffer loſs, a loſs however which he will have no reaſon to regret; becauſe he himſelf ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire, i. e. as "a brand plucked out of the burning." But if any man's work ſhall abide the trial, he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a reward, from that impartial and all-penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Judge, who "ſhall try every man's work of what ſort it is." This I take to be the meaning of the Apoſtle in our text and context.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This interpretation was deduced from a view of the context, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting any commentators. Upon looking into ſome of them ſince, I find, that though they allow good and bad <hi>works</hi> to be implied, yet they rather underſtand good and bad <hi>doctrines</hi> to be intended, by the figures uſed in the 12th verſe; and by the builders, they ſuppoſe are meant public teachers (vid. Pol. Synopſ.).</p>
                  <p>This method of interpreting the paſſage appears to me too much reſtrained in itſelf, and foreign to the Apoſtle's purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſee no reaſon why "every man" who is ſaid to be building on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be reſtricted to public teachers; ſince, every man muſt contribute to his own edification, and thereby to the edification of the church; and Chriſtians are exhorted to "build up <hi>themſelves</hi> in their moſt holy faith." Teaching is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſubſervient to this end, but practice much more ſo; and the practice of Chriſtianity is "every man's" duty.</p>
                  <p>Nor can I ſee why good and bad doctrines ſhould be meant by the metaphors in the 12th verſe, <hi>rather</hi> than good and bad works; ſince, the goodneſs or badneſs of any doctrine is to be eſtimated by its tendency to produce good or bad fruits in them that hear and believe it. The truths of the Goſpel naturally tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce faith and holineſs, and falſe doctrines lead to falſe dependence and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous conduct.</p>
                  <p>The deſign of the Apoſtle appears to be to reprehend, not falſe teaching, but falſe practice. He is reproving the Corinthians for their "<hi>envying, ſtrife and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,</hi>" v. 3. Although he had
<q>determined to know nothing among them, but JESUS CHRIST, and him crucified,</q>
and had laid this for the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet they were building on the foundation, with thoſe corrupt materials, inſtead of the oppoſite graces of <hi>love, unity</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> to which he had exhorted them (chap. i. 10). He therefore ſets before them the folly and unprofitableneſs of their conduct, by telling them, that when their work ſhall come to be tried by fire. i. e. by the exact and impartial diſcernment of Him,
<q>whoſe eyes are like a flame of fire,</q>
that corrupt part of it ſhall be burnt up, whilſt only that which is pure ſhall abide and be rewarded. But he does not give the leaſt hint that thoſe corrupt works were produced in them by falſe teaching; on the contrary, he ſpeaks with a becoming reſpect of Apollos and Cephas, who had been their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, after himſelf, and aſcribes the "envying, ſtrife and diviſions" which were among them, to their own carnal diſpoſition; i. e. to the power of unmortified luſts, and to their not being fully brought off from their former
<q>vain conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;</q>
they were "yet carnal, and walked as men."</p>
                  <p>By a parity of reaſoning, all impure and corrupt mixtures, either in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, heart, or life of believers, which tend to keep them imperfect in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, love and obedience, may be reckoned as "wood, hay and ſtubble," in the ſpiritual building, which will be deſtroyed; and on the contrary, all thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in divine knowledge, love and holineſs, which are the genuine fruits of the Holy Spirit's operation, and their own concurrent endeavours, may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the "gold, ſilver and precious ſtones," which ſhall abide the deciſive trial, and ſhall remain and increaſe forever</p>
               </note> He would
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024089_0006_0FC331EF2E762A40"/>
have us take heed that we build on the true founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for God has laid but one, and no man can lay another. Yet as it is too evident that many perſons, and ſome who call themſelves Chriſtians, are either building on an imperfect foundation, or elſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the foundation, for ſome part of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure; I ſhall endeavour, in diſcourſing on this ſubject,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſhew that JESUS CHRIST is the only Foundation, on which we can build with ſafety.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To point out the weakneſs and inſufficiency of other things which we may miſtake for the Foundation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I am to ſhew, that JESUS CHRIST is the only Foundation, on which we can build with ſafety.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian life is here compared to a building raiſed on a foundation; to a building not yet finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but which is growing up by degrees, to an holy temple in the Lord. A foundation is in its nature fixed and immoveable, compoſed of the firmeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, laid with great care and ſtrength, ſo as to bear the ſtructure, without any danger of its falling or ſinking. Such a foundation is CHRIST, as he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Prophet;
<q>Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation, a ſtone, a tried ſtone, a precious cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone, a ſure foundation.</q>
(Iſa. xxviii. 16.) When he is ſaid to be a foundation, the meaning is, that on his account alone, we can hope for pardon and eternal life: And this will appear if we conſider the dignity of his perſon, the depth of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the glorious teſtimony of God to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his work.</p>
            <p>The dignity of his Perſon conſiſted in his being the Son of God. The name whereby he is called is
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024089_0007_0FC331F2E9611038"/>
"Wonderful," ſo wonderful, that as he himſelf tells us, "No man knoweth the Son but the Father." The Apoſtle Paul, who had the moſt elevated and comprehenſive idea of the divine nature and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that any mortal ever had, has informed us, that by this glorious Perſon, whom he ſtiles
<q>the image of the inviſible GOD, the firſt born of every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were all things created, which are in heaven, and which are in earth, viſible and inviſible;</q>
the Angels in their various ranks and orders, which he thus reckons up,
<q>Thrones, Dominions, Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Powers;</q>
and not only that all things were created by him, but <hi>for</hi> him, and for this reaſon he is ſtiled "the heir of all things," and "Lord of all." The whole creation being his own work, is his own property, and inheritance. No change or revolution could come to paſs in his creation, without ſerving in ſome way to manifeſt his glory. Among the creatures which he endowed with rational powers and freedom of will, ſome of the ſuperior order, abuſing their natural liberty,
<q>kept not their firſt eſtate, but left their own habitation, and are reſerved in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains, under darkneſs, to the judgment of the great day.</q>
This is all which is revealed to us, concerning the defection, or revolt of thoſe ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior beings; and perhaps we ſhould never have been made acquainted with ſo much as this, if there had not been ſome connexion between that event, and our own apoſtacy. For the prince of thoſe fallen ſpirits was the inſtrument of ſpreading ruin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in this world: He ſeduced our firſt parents to join him in rebellion againſt their Maker; and thus brought mankind into a ſtate of ſin.</p>
            <p>To recover from ruin, that part of his creation which had been thus ſeduced, the glorious Son of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024089_0008_0FC331F452DC6E20"/>
God was pleaſed to become a Mediator, with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Divine juſtice required that the guilty ſhould be puniſhed; but the mercy and compaſſion of our Emmanuel, led him to undertake the work of our redemption, by making himſelf a ſacrifice for us. And becauſe it was impoſſible that he ſhould perform this work, in his pre-exiſtent ſtate; becauſe it was impoſſible that he ſhould ſuffer death, without a body to ſuffer in; therefore God his Father prepared him a body, in the womb of a virgin, which body was "the ſeed of Abraham."</p>
            <p>We are then to conſider that glorious and exalted Being, who "was in the form of GOD," who was "in the beginning with GOD," and "was GOD"; whoſe comprehenſive powers were equal to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government of the heavens and earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the condition of an human infant, one of the moſt weak and helpleſs beings in the world; all thoſe vaſt and amazing faculties which he poſſeſſed in the days of eternity, incloſed within the ſcanty limits of an infant mind, to be opened and unfolded by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. He who
<q>was made better than the angels, and obtained by inheritance a more excellent name than they,</q>
was "made lower than the angels." He who was that wiſdom which
<q>the Lord poſſeſſed in the beginning of his way,</q>
was reduced to ſuch a ſtate as to grow in wiſdom as he grew in ſtature. He who was Lord and Governor of heaven and earth, became ſubject to Joſeph and Mary, and lived in ſtrict obedience to their commands. He "in whom were hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge," condeſcended to ſit in the midſt of the Jewiſh doctors, aſking them queſtions, and hearing with attention their anſwers. He who was Lord of the angels, and againſt whom ſome of them rebelled, was beſet with
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024089_0009_0FC331FB174FF4E0"/>
the temptations of that ſoul ſpirit, the leader of their rebellion, was vexed with his impudent ſuggeſtions, and carried about by him from place to place, that he might be tempted in a variety of ways, and that the temptations might have the greateſt force. He who was King of kings, and Lord of lords, put on the form of a ſervant. He who was happy in the joys of eternity, condeſcended to wearineſs, hunger and thirſt, grief and diſtreſs of mind. He who knew the heart of man, was betrayed by a falſe friend. He who had "all power in heaven and earth," and was able to "rule in the midſt of his enemies," was carried before the tribunal of an hypocritical high-prieſt, and the judgment-ſeat of a time-ſerving governor. He who is "the faithful witneſs," was falſely accuſed, and
<q>the Judge of all</q>
was unjuſtly condemned.
<q>The Prince of Life</q>
was hanged on a tree, and gave himſelf up to Death. His holy ſoul was penetrated with a moſt deep and affecting ſenſe of the honor of his Father's law, the dignity of his character, the rectitude of his government, the juſtice and neceſſity of thoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which he was entering upon, and at the ſame time filled with the moſt tender love and compaſſion to mankind. Whilſt all theſe views were preſent in his mind, and whilſt at the ſame time he reflected on the eternal love of God to him,
<q>the glory which he had with him before the foundation of the world,</q>
and the unſpeakable happineſs he had enjoyed
<q>in the boſom of the Father, rejoicing always before him,</q>
he had now the gloomy proſpect of being "cut off," and "made a curſe:" and can we wonder, that, with theſe views and proſpects in his mind, he ſhould pray the Father to
<q>glorify him again, with that glory which he had with him before the world was?</q>
This prayer was made in full faith and confidence; and we are aſſured, that "he was heard in that he feared."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:024089_0010_0FC331FD6D109F00"/>God was pleaſed to give the moſt public, ſolemn teſtimony to the perfection of his righteouſneſs, and the acceptance of his ſacrifice, by raiſing him from the dead, and exalting him to his own right hand in the heavenly places. Being thus
<q>made perfect through ſuffering, he is become the author of eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that obey him.</q>
Upon this foundation, namely, the once offered ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt, God is reconciling the world to himſelf. Upon this foundation the Church is built. "Chriſt is the ſtone which the Jewiſh builders rejected, and which is now become the head of the corner; neither is there ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in any other, for there is no other name given under heaven, among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the ſecond thing propoſed, viz.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To point out the weakneſs and inſufficiency of other things, which we may miſtake for our foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are ſome who build their religion only on the foundation of <hi>nature;</hi> on the natural notions which they have of God, his attributes and works. They have learnt that there is a God, that he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely wiſe, holy, juſt and good; and from theſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of God, they infer the duties of reverence, love, and obedience to the dictates of that law which he has written on the heart. Theſe primary truths and duties of religion are all contained in the Goſpel, and make an eſſential part of it; but this foundation is defective, becauſe it admits not of a Mediator. It will do for innocent, but not for ſinful creatures. This foundation is defective, becauſe it has no ſacrifice for ſin, and conſequently no promiſe of forgiveneſs. The religion of nature will teach us a great part of our duty; but it will not ſhew us how we can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024089_0011_0FC33209427EF250"/>
of God, when we are preſſed with a ſenſe of guilt; it cannot take that burden off from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and give us hope toward God, when we view ourſelves as ſinners in his ſight. This foundation alone, therefore, will not do for ſinful creatures to build upon, eſpecially for thoſe who have a better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them. If they neglect the true foundation, which God has revealed in the ſcriptures, and build only on this, they ſhew that they
<q>love darkneſs rather than light.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever knowledge of God may be deduced from the works of nature and providence, yet it is certain, that by Jeſus Chriſt there is the moſt full and glorious diſcovery made of the divine perfections.
<q>In him dwelt <hi>all the fulneſs</hi> of the Godhead, bodily;</q>
ſo that they who ſaw him, ſaw the Father who dwelt in him. God did "in very deed dwell with man," though
<q>the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him.</q>
"God was manifeſted in the fleſh," and diſplayed his glorious perfections in human nature; yet in ſuch a mild, eaſy and familiar view, as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the love, as well as veneration of thoſe who "beheld his glory." And by the revelation of God in Jeſus Chriſt, we are led to ſuch a knowledge of him, as will be the eternal life of our ſouls; a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is begun here, and will be increaſing through eternity. Let the Deiſt then boaſt of his natural knowledge of God, and throw the Mediator out of his religion; the Chriſtian will believe, that
<q>there is ONE God, and ONE Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus;</q>
and in this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, he will ſee more of God, and be more happy in his acquaintance with him, than the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Deiſt can without him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An <hi>outward profeſſion</hi> ſtands, for ſome people,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024089_0012_0FC3320DC46722E0"/>
inſtead of a foundation. They flatter themſelves, that becauſe they have been baptized into the name of Chriſt, or becauſe they have entered into the number of viſible Chriſtians, or becauſe they are regular in their attendance on the public worſhip and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, therefore it will be well with them hereafter. There are not many who will own this; for they would be aſhamed to have it known, that they have no better foundation; but yet they vainly preſume, in their hearts, that the reſpect, which they outwardly ſhew to religion, will commend them to God, as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy objects of his ſavour: They think themſelves the friends of Chriſt, becauſe they eat and drink in his preſence, and call him Lord, Lord, and appear among his diſciples. Such a conduct as this, is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as if we ſhould miſtake the outward covering and ornaments of a building for the foundation. An outward profeſſion, an attendance on religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ordinances, are but the ornamental part of the chriſtian character; they are indeed duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Chriſtian, for it is our duty to be, and to appear to be, the diſciples of Chriſt; but if we have no real religion within, to what purpoſe do we put on the appearance of it? Why do we attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive men, when God knows our heart? What will it avail to plead, that we have eaten and drunken in the preſence of Chriſt, when he ſhall ſay,
<q>I know you not, depart from me, ye that work iniquity?</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Some people build their religion on a <hi>partial view of Chriſt, as a redeemer.</hi> They believe that he died to redeem us from the puniſhment of ſin in the future world; but they have no idea of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from the power of ſin in this world: They will readily truſt in him as a ſaviour from the wrath of God, but they are not willing to ſubmit to him as
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024089_0013_0FC332190BE9ED40"/>
a King and Lord, and bow their necks to his yoke: They would be glad to be ſaved by him, but they are not willing to be ruled by him: They entertain very high thoughts of the mercy of God towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the merits of Chriſt's blood, to deliver them from deſtruction; but they have no regard to the duty which God requires of them; no readineſs to the work of mortification and ſelf-denial; no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to do any thing in religion, but to entertain a blind hope, and a dead faith in Chriſt, as a partial redeemer. They may think they are building on the true foundation, becauſe they are in raptures with Chriſt and free grace; but it is a Chriſt of their own making, and not the Chriſt of God; it is grace of their own deviſing, and not the grace of the Goſpel; for
<q>the grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation, teacheth us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godlily in the world;</q>
and Chriſt
<q>gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</q>
Thoſe therefore who pretend to build on Chriſt, and yet have no deſire to be redeemed from iniquity, no deſire to deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to take up their croſs and follow him; no deſire to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godlily in the world; whatever high notions they may entertain of Chriſt and free grace, are yet ſtrangers to the true foundation of chriſtian hope.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There are others who go on the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, and fancy that they ſhall be ſaved becauſe of their <hi>good works,</hi> without any juſt regard to the perfect obedience of the Mediator. They are exact in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſome of the duties of morality, honeſt in their dealings, faithful to their promiſes, and kind to the poor; or, they are punctual in their devotion and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024089_0014_0FC3322235483688"/>
obſervation of the Sabbath, and in ſupporting the preaching of the Goſpel; or, they are ſober, chaſte and temperate in their behaviour. Theſe are all good works, good in themſelves, for they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duties, and have a tendency to do good, and God forbid that any man ſhould, by any means, be diſcouraged from the performance of them. But then we ſhould remember, that theſe are not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which we are to build; they ought rather to be accounted a part of the ſuperſtructure. Good works are proper materials in the ſpiritual building, but they ſhould be put in their proper place, and not laid as the foundation of our hope of eternal life. They are, when rightly performed, fruits and evidences of our faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and our regard to his authority; but they are not the ground of our hope, becauſe they are imperfect. If we would be juſtified by <hi>our</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it muſt be perfect. None but a perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs can be allowed or accepted by God, as a ground of juſtification in the eye of his law; and where is the man who dare look the law of God in the face, and ſay, "<hi>I am righteous?</hi>" If there be any defect in our obedience, be it ever ſo ſmall, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will mar the whole. "<hi>If we keep the whole law, and offend in one point, we are guilty of all.</hi>" But how often does it happen, that they who expect to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their works, and who glory in their obſervance of ſome of the rules of morality, are as remarkably deficient in others? Are there not ſome, who are ſcrupulous in their dealings, exact to their promiſes and the payment of their debts, yet are given to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate and profane language, or the luſt of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Are there not ſome who are nice in their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Sabbath, and the forms of devotion, and yet will make no ſcruple to ſlander their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024089_0015_0FC33223843BB5B0"/>
raiſe falſe reports, entertain groundleſs jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and evil ſurmiſings, abuſe well-meaning people, and ſow the ſeeds of diſcord among brethren? Are there not ſome, who are ſober, chaſte and temperate, who keep their tongues from ſlander and reproach, and yet will cheat and over-reach in their trade, and take advantage of the ignorance, or neceſſity, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs of others, to advance their own intereſt? Few people are entirely conſiſtent and uniform in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the duties of morality; and if they make their foundation of ſuch imperfect, ill-joined materials as theſe, they have but a poor bottom to ſtand upon, and their building will fall into ruin.</p>
            <p>As Chriſt is the true foundation of our hope to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, ſo he is the foundation of all that moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and thoſe good works, which will be accepted and rewarded at the laſt day. We are commanded to do all that we do,
<q>in the name of Chriſt, and to the glory of God by him;</q>
and if it be ſo done, it will be accepted and rewarded for his ſake. The grace of God will accept and reward the obedience of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for the ſake of Him who has
<q>fulfilled all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</q>
and by "whoſe obedience we are
<q>made righteous.</q>
Chriſt has all power given to him in heaven and earth; power to diſpenſe rewards and puniſhments, to every man, according to his works; and when he ſhall come in the glory of his Father, he will make this diſtribution, with the moſt exact diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and the ſtricteſt impartiality.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Some people are very fond of building upon their <hi>experiences.</hi> They think they have experienced ſuch things, in the courſe of their paſt lives, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate them the favourites of heaven, and they have great confidence ariſing from ſuch a perſuaſion. But, if what they have experienced is falſe and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024089_0016_0FC332251B0E5C70"/>
their confidence is in the higheſt degree dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; and, if their experiences are ever ſo real and well-grounded, yet they muſt be carefully diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the foundation, for they are no part of it, but are rather a part of the ſuperſtructure which is built upon it. And here I ſhall be more large and particular, becauſe this is a very eſſential part of Chriſtian knowledge; and an exact attention to it will greatly tend to remove difficulties, and clear up obſcurities, with which many good people are troubled.</p>
            <p>By falſe experiences, I mean thoſe exerciſes of the mind, which exiſt only in the imagination or paſſions, and never truly affect the heart, or have a right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the moral conduct. Such, for inſtance, is the pleaſure which we feel in hearing ſome particular ſorts of preaching; where, the mere force and energy of the ſpeaker's voice, the gracefulneſs of his oratory, or the ſmoothneſs of his periods, give a pleaſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the animal ſpirits. Or, thoſe workings of the paſſions, either of admiration, fear, grief, joy or pity, which are excited by an attention to the word preached, and which go off as ſoon as the ſound is out of our ears. Or, thoſe may be termed falſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, which conſiſt in the lively working of the fancy, either ſleeping or waking; ſuch as ſeeing ſights, hearing voices, feeling impulſes and impreſſions, which we do not know how to account for, and ſo imagine them to be from the Spirit of God. When a perſon forſakes the Word of God, as his rule, and gives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to the wild wanderings of his imagination, under a notion that he is immediately dictated to by the Spirit of God, he is in a fair way to run into all manner of confuſion and error, both of principle and conduct. Or, we may call thoſe falſe experiences,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024089_0017_0FC33226DFC64318"/>
which are grounded on the ſudden impreſſions of texts of ſcripture on the mind, without any regard to the meaning and deſign of the ſacred writers. Truth may indeed be brought to the mind in this way by the Spirit of God, and he may uſe the words of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are his own words, to convey truth to the mind; but before we can determine whether ſuch impreſſions are from him or not, we ſhould conſult the ſcriptures, and be ſure that we underſtand thoſe texts, which are ſo impreſſed, according to their juſt ſenſe and meaning; for we know that the devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has quoted ſcripture, by ſcraps and pieces, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his temptations; as he did to Chriſt, when he would have had him caſt himſelf down from the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the temple. And we ſhould always be ſure that we pay more regard to <hi>the truth itſelf,</hi> than to the ſudden and extraordinary manner of its coming into our mind. If we have a regard to the truths and commands of God's word, it is of no great impor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance, whether they come into our mind by reading, by hearing, by recollection, or by ſudden impreſſion: But if we regard ſudden impreſſions, though made in the very words of ſcripture, as a ſign of the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing favour of God toward us, and make uſe of them, to uphold a notion that we are admitted to more intimate communion with him, than other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who take pains to ſearch the ſcripture, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their knowledge more ſlowly and regularly, we have a ſad proof of the blinding power of ſpiritual pride and preſumption. In ſhort, all thoſe workings of the imagination, all thoſe flights of paſſion, all thoſe impulſes and impreſſions, which tend to raiſe our opinion of ourſelves, as if we were higher in the favour of God than others; to make us look with contempt on thoſe whom we imagine to be not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024089_0018_0FC3322839B2D020"/>
to ſuch familiarity with our Maker; to make us truſt in our own attainments, and neglect the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted means of divine knowledge; all ſuch things, call them experiences, manifeſtations, or what you will, are vain and deceitful, and as worthleſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the righteouſneſs which Paul had before his converſion, and which he accounted but "as dung," when he came to know the grace of God in truth.<note n="†" place="bottom">The reader may ſee this point largely diſcuſſed, with great preciſion and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etration, in the late Preſident Edwards's Treatiſe of Religious Affections.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But there is another kind of experiences, which are real and well-grounded, and yet are to be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the foundation of the Chriſtian's hope. For inſtance, every one, who is acquainted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Jeſus Chriſt, has had experience of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of his own heart; he is convinced, by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that there is in him no good thing; he has ſeen that his ſins have ſeparated between God and him, and that it is not in his power to remove the guilt of them, or ſecure the favour and mercy of God toward him. How abſurd would it be to rely on ſuch an experience as this, for the foundation of his hope? Is not the natural tendency of it to take him off from all ſelf-dependence, and lead him to Chriſt, in whom alone he can find that righteouſneſs, on which he may ſafely build his hope of pardon and life? And indeed this is the true nature and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of all gracious and ſpiritual experiences, to ſhew us our own emptineſs and inſufficiency, and to make us prize and value Chriſt above all things. But our experience of the worthineſs and excellency of Chriſt, and of his ſuitableneſs to be our ſaviour, is not the reaſon of his being ſo; he is ſo, whether we experience it or not; he is altogether lovely in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whether we perceive his beauty and lovelineſs or
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024089_0019_0FC33229E39E6C68"/>
not; he is infinitely worthy in himſelf, or we could not perceive him to be ſo; he has "all fulneſs" dwelling in him, or we could not
<q>receive of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</q>
There is an eſſential glory, dignity and lovelineſs in his character, and a ſuitableneſs in him to be our ſaviour, which is the ground and reaſon of all exerciſe of truſt in him, and love to him; and our belief of it unites us to him, and engages us to truſt in him, to love and ſerve him.</p>
            <p>However, theſe experiences, though real, ſpiritual, and delightful, yet are liable to great imperfection and interruption; and for this reaſon, if there were no other, they are not a ſuitable foundation for our hope. There is no Chriſtian, however highly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God with a ſenſe of his love and grace, and with a ſight of the glory, excellency and lovelineſs of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but has been forced to experience, on the contrary, the hidings of God's face, and the withdraw of thoſe comfortable manifeſtations of the love of God; eſpecially when he has been ſurprized into ſome ſin, the guilt of which hangs heavy on his ſoul, and renders him offenſive to an holy God. In ſuch a circumſtance, can it be any juſt ground of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Chriſtian, to reflect upon his paſt experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences? Can he patch up a righteouſneſs out of them, in which he may appear pure before an heart-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God? Will old experiences quiet his mind, under a ſenſe of new guilt? Will they purge his conſcience from dead works? Rather, will they not ſerve to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate his guilt? Will he not be aſhamed of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude to that God, who has ſo highly ſavoured him? Will he not ſee that he has violated the ſtrongeſt obligations? Will he not be aſhamed of his baſeneſs and vileneſs? And will he have peace or reſt in his mind, till he has humbled himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024089_0020_0FC33233FA1245A0"/>
God, and begged his pardoning mercy? And on what ground will he aſk, or can he look for mercy? Certainly, not from any thing that has heretofore paſſed in his mind; for that which is an aggravation of his offence cannot be the ground of his forgiveneſs; but he muſt, he will look to the atoning blood of the Lamb of God, ſhed for him ages before he was born; and thence he will derive all his hope and comfort.</p>
            <p>Moreover, ſuppoſing that a Chriſtian may, either by the natural decay of his rational faculties, or the power of a melancholy habit, loſe all ſenſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his paſt experiences, or be inclined to call in queſtion the reality of them; in either of theſe caſes, what muſt he do? If experiences are the ground of his hope, his hope is gone, and he muſt abandon himſelf to deſpair. But God has provided better for us than this. He has provided "ſtrong conſolation" for them that fly
<q>for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet before them;</q>
this refuge is always open; and though a Chriſtian has fled to it ever ſo often, ſtill he may flee to it again. If he ſhould loſe all comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe of having done ſo before, yet the doors of everlaſting mercy are wide open to receive him; and if he comes, "he ſhall in no wiſe be caſt out."
<q>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure;</q>
ſo ſure, that none of the changes, darkneſſes and perplexities of our minds can remove it.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian experiences are ſo far from being the proper foundation of our hope, that though they ſhould be all loſt to our remembrance, yet the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our hope will remain, and we may have recourſe to it at all times, as much as we had at firſt, and derive the ſame comfort and ſupport from it. The moſt experienced Chriſtian in the world has no better, no other foundation for his hope than he had
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024089_0021_0FC3324024563B18"/>
the firſt moment he became a believer: He knows there is no other name given under heaven, whereby he can be ſaved, but the name of Chriſt; and though he has had ever ſo bright and clear evidence of his union to him, and intereſt in him, it does not add any thing to the ſtrength of his foundation; it does not add any thing to the virtue and merit of that blood which cleanſeth from all ſin, of that atonement which was the original ground of his reconciliation to God: He ſtill looks on himſelf as an unworthy ſinner, and puts his whole truſt in that
<q>righteouſneſs which delivereth from death.</q>
The reſult of all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences is to abaſe himſelf in his own eyes, and to exalt Chriſt in his eſteem; he finds him exceedingly precious, as the author and finiſher of his faith, and through him alone he hopes for acceptance before the preſence of a righteous God.</p>
            <p>We ſee then, that experiences are to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the foundation; they are no part of it; but rather ariſe out of it; and the uſe of them is this; they are, in conjunction with acts of obedience, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of our being built on the true foundation. I ſay, in conjunction with acts of obedience, becauſe, without obedience to the commands of Chriſt, we certainly are not his diſciples; and if our experiences are not accompanied with obedience, they are not true nor genuine; but both together ſerve to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that we are built on the foundation; they are both fruits of the Spirit of Chriſt, and
<q>hereby do we know that we are of the truth, by the ſpirit which he hath given us.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let me now aſſiſt you in making ſome IMPROVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And, in the firſt place, I would caution you againſt making a wrong uſe of it. Do not haſtily conclude,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024089_0022_0FC3324187B17798"/>
from what you have heard, that all who have not ſuch clear ideas of the diſtinction between the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and the ſuperſtructure, are building on a wrong foundation. Some very ſincere Chriſtians may have very indiſtinct notions of theſe things. They know that they muſt believe in Chriſt; they know that they muſt obey him, and they know they muſt have an experimental acquaintance with relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, or they cannot be ſaved: And they are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this faith, and this obedience, and this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledge, and yet, not being able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between them, they blend them all together as the foundation of their hope, which is thereby greatly interrupted and obſcured. But as our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Redeemer knows
<q>how to have compaſſion on the ignorant, and ſuch as are out of the way;</q>
ſo we ſhould exerciſe our charity toward all thoſe who appear to love and obey the Goſpel, though, at the ſame time, they appear to be but "babes in Chriſt," and "unſkilful in the word of righteouſneſs."</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ſhould improve this ſubject to clear up the doubts and darkneſſes which Chriſtians are often troubled with, for want of attending to this diſtinction between the foundation and the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure.</p>
            <p>When Chriſtians look within themſelves, they ſee ſuch remainders of corruption, ſuch imperfection in holineſs, ſuch a mixture of ſin with their beſt duties and brighteſt enjoyments, that they are ready to queſtion their own ſincerity; they are afraid that they are building on a wrong foundation, and their peace and comfort are greatly interrupted: This makes them drag heavily along, and robs them of that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which they might enjoy by a direct contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the objects of faith and hope. This doubting,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024089_0023_0FC332430D164010"/>
heſitating frame of mind is very common with Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians on a ſick bed, and is much increaſed by the weakneſs of their bodies, and the ſuggeſtions of the great adverſary, who loves to vex and diſtreſs, though it is not in his power to deſtroy, the ſheep of Chriſt. But if Chriſtians would learn to diſtinguiſh between the foundation, and the ſuperſtructure which is raiſed upon it, this would help to remove, or prevent the darkneſs they are troubled with. And there is a clear diſtinction between them; for the one is perfect, and the other is imperfect; the foundation is the work of God alone, and is therefore abſolutely perfect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable and immoveable; the other is the joint work of God's Spirit and themſelves; and is, as the Apoſtle deſcribes it in our context, a mixture of gold, ſilver and precious ſtones, with wood, hay and ſtubble; a mixture of ſpiritual graces and virtues with human errors, weakneſſes and infirmities. Now if we look among this mixture, we ſhall find ſome things good and valuable, and ſome things vile, mean and abominable; but nothing fit to rely upon, nothing that can give us hope and confidence toward God. If we look over our devotional exerciſes, we ſhall find ſome degree of ſeriouſneſs, of love to God, of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Chriſt, and ſubmiſſion to the divine will; and therewith we ſhall find a mixture of pride and vanity, wanderings of heart, careleſſneſs and formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. If we look over our good works, we ſhall find ſome things juſt and charitable, honeſt and of good report; and we ſhall find a mixture of paſſion, or prejudice, or ſelfiſhneſs, or vain-glory, among theſe. If we look over our experiences, we may recollect ſome ſeaſons of great pleaſure and delight in God and the things of religion; we may find that we have, by divine grace, been enabled to reſiſt and overcome
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024089_0024_0FC33244C2D22EE8"/>
very ſtrong temptations; that we have enjoyed much light and comfort in the word of God; much ſupport in affliction, and the like: And on the other hand, we ſhall find that we have had experience of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of our hearts; too eaſy compliance with the alluring vanities of the world; a reſtive, repining diſpoſition of mind, and a want of ſubmiſſion to God's will. There is no Chriſtian but will find ſuch a mixture of purity and impurity, ſin and duty, in his own heart and life. But let him remember, that ſuch a mixture as this is not the foundation, it is the ſuperſtructure which is built upon it, and which will be tried with fire; the wood, hay and ſtubble will be burnt up; and all that is worth preſerving, will be preſerved. The foundation is quite a different thing; it is nothing leſs than the perfect obedience of the Son of God, the "everlaſting righteouſneſs" which he hath "brought in" for the juſtification of the guilty: This is a thing which cannot be moved or ſhaken by any changes that paſs in our minds; if our devotion, our obedience, our experience be ever ſo imperfect, yet the foundation of God is perfect; the everlaſting righteouſneſs of the Redeemer is as firm as the throne of God; the anchor of our hope is
<q>within the vail, whither the Fore-runner is entered, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</q>
Here then muſt we look for hope and comfort; here is the "ſtrong conſolation" which God has provided for the heirs of ſalvation: Behold the Lamb of God! turn your eyes off from yourſelves, and look to Jeſus, whom your ſins have pierced! Behold him giving his life a ranſom for you! Behold him riſing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſuming that life which he laid down, carrying hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature to heaven, and ſeating it on the right hand of God! and behold him there, making con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024089_0025_0FC3325576EAFD90"/>
interceſſion for you! Draw your comfort from this ſource, and you need not fear drawing too much; there is enough to ſatisfy the moſt enlarged deſires of your immortal ſouls. Let not a ſenſe of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs hinder you from enjoying this rich con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; for it is intended only for thoſe who know themſelves utterly unworthy; they only can receive it with a true reliſh; Goſpel bleſſings are not bought and ſold, they are freely given, and freely received, "without money and without price." Behold the grace of the giver, and eſteem the gift for its worth and preciouſneſs; take the comfort which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and which is deſigned for you, and keep not yourſelves in doubt and darkneſs. If you look with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yourſelves ever ſo long, ever ſo critically, you will find nothing there to be any foundation for comfort; you will there ſee enough to be a ground of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and deſpair; but if you look to Chriſt, you will ſee enough in him to give you hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence toward God.</p>
            <p>I doubt not there are many true Chriſtians who are often perplexed with doubts and darkneſs about their ſpiritual ſtate, becauſe they ſee ſo much wickedneſs and imperfection in themſelves; and yet, whenever they can happily get diſengaged from themſelves, and turn their eyes toward their Redeemer, can rejoice and delight in him, are perfectly ſatisfied with the plan of divine grace, and the method of ſalvation; and though they
<q>walk in darkneſs, and ſee no light, can truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay themſelves on their God;</q>
and thus prove that they are built on the true foundation. The beſt way, therefore, to get rid of doubts and darkneſs, fears and ſcruples, is to go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the foundation, and begin again, juſt as if we had never done any thing before, as if we were but
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:024089_0026_0FC33256899CBD38"/>
juſt ſetting out in religion; and we ſhall then find the ſame comfort, ariſing from a view of Chriſt and his redemption, as we did at firſt; and as often as we get involved in darkneſs, do the ſame;
<q>forget the things that are behind,</q>
leave the wood, hay and ſtubble to be burnt up, and take our comfort from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is always fixed and immoveable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, What has been ſaid may alſo be improved for the detection of hypocriſy. I do not mean, that we ſhould detect the hypocriſy of one another, but of ourſelves. Thus, we ſhould examine what it is that we are building upon. Are we building on our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion of religion, our regular ſtanding in the church, on the ſuppoſed goodneſs of our moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, or our paſt experiences? if ſo, then we are miſtaking our foundation; and the ſooner we diſcover our miſtake, the better it will be for us. Let me aſſiſt you a little in this ſelf-examination.</p>
            <p>Are you regular in your profeſſion of religion and attendance on the means of inſtruction? Very well, this is your duty. Do you do it from a regard to Chriſt, and becauſe he would have all his diſciples make an open profeſſion of their relation to him? Do you do it to ſhew that you are not aſhamed of a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saviour, even in the midſt of a crooked, perverſe and ſcoffing generation? This is a duty you owe to Him, who hath redeemed you by his blood, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires you to confeſs him before men, and has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to confeſs you before his Father and his angels. But if you are proud of your profeſſion; if you look upon yourſelves as ſuperior to other perſons who make not ſuch a profeſſion; if you deſpiſe them as perſons who do not ſtand in ſo near a relation to God as you; if you are ready to ſay,
<q>God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, nor as this publican,</q>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:024089_0027_0FC3325807414108"/>
then your ſacrifice is ſo tainted with pride, your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is ſuch a bubble, and your heart is ſo rotten and deceitful, that God will look on you with the ſame contempt as you do on others; for he looks not at the outward appearance, but at the heart.</p>
            <p>Again, Are you punctual and exact in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of moral duties? Do you deal juſtly with all men, and ſhew mercy to the diſtreſſed? This is doing well. But are you conſiſtent with yourſelves in what you do? Have you regard to <hi>all</hi> God's commands? Do you perform ſecret duties? Do you pray to your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who ſees in ſecret? Do you give your alms ſo that your left hand knows not what your right hand does? Do you mortify ſecret luſts? Do you watch and guard againſt ſecret temptations? Do you aim to be ſpiritually minded? And do you do all this in a firm reliance on the grace of Chriſt, and the aid of his Spirit, deſiring to approve yourſelves faithful in the ſight of Him who ſearches the heart? Theſe are ſigns that you are building on the true foundation; your morality is of the nature of gold, ſilver and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, which will abide the devouring fire; and though you may have ſome mixture of wood, hay and ſtubble, yet that will be burnt up, and you will be ſaved. But if your morality is only outward; if you do works of juſtice or charity to be ſeen of men; if whilſt your outſide is fair, your hearts are impure; if you do not ſtruggle with ſecret luſts; if you are not uniform and conſiſtent in your obedience; if you perform one duty becauſe it is convenient, or becauſe it will get you a good name, and neglect another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no outward advantage attending it; then your morality is but
<q>a ſounding braſs and a tinkling cymbal;</q>
it may indeed be of ſome benefit to mankind, and to yourſelf too, in outward reſpects;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024089_0028_0FC3326286D7C138"/>
it may be beſt for the world and for your temporal intereſt, but you have but a very poor foundation to expect, that "our God, who is a conſuming fire," will accept or reward it, in that day,
<q>when the fire ſhall try every man's work, of what ſort it is.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Have you had experiences? Do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how you have been formerly wrought upon by the word of God? Have you been led to ſee the wickedneſs of your own heart? Have you been led to ſee yourſelf condemned, by the righteous ſentence of God's law? Have you been led to ſee the way of eſcape from the wrath of God? And do you ſuppoſe you were enabled to
<q>fly for refuge, and lay hold on the hope ſet before you?</q>
Perhaps you then expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſuch joy and ſatisfaction, that, in the firſt warmth of your affections, you were ready to forſake all for Chriſt, and even thought you could lay down your life for his ſake; you were eager to profeſs your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his diſciple, and join with them that loved re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; you loved the company of thoſe who ſeemed moſt zealous; you loved to hear plain, practical, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental preaching; you loved to examine yourſelf by the marks which you read, or heard, from time to time, out of the word of God; and you were pleaſed when you found a correſpondence in your own hearts thereto; ſo far it was well; this was a good beginning. But how is it now? How has it been ever ſince? Have you, ever ſince that time, been growing in your hatred of ſin, and your love of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs? Have you, ever ſince that time, been morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying your corrupt luſts? Have you, ever ſince that time, been guarding againſt the ſin that eaſily beſets you? Have you, ever ſince that time, been crucified to the world, and the world to you? Have you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, and do you yet continue to experience,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024089_0029_0FC3326A855F2EE0"/>
daily conflicts with your luſts? And when you are hard driven, and preſſed by temptations, do you go to "the Captain of ſalvation," and beg him to make his ſtrength perfect in your weakneſs? And do you experience "his grace to be ſufficient for you," and that with every temptation, there is a way for your eſcape? You have lived ſome time in the world, and had doubtleſs ſome experience of the vanity of it, do you find that your heart is weaned from it? that your affections are more ſtrongly ſet on heaven? You have doubtleſs met with afflictions, and what experience have you had in them? Do you find that "tribulation worketh patience?" Do you receive the diſcipline of God's providence with meekneſs, with ſubmiſſion to his will, with a child-like diſpoſition? Do you rejoice in tribulation? and
<q>count it all joy when you fall into divers trials?</q>
Are you glad that God tries you as gold is tried, that you may be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the droſs of corruption, and have greater evidence of your own purity? And are theſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences accompanied with a reſolute ſelf-denial? a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering obedience to the will of God? a regard to his glory and the good of mankind? Do you
<q>deal juſtly, and love mercy, and walk humbly with your God?</q>
Do you "forgive men their treſpaſſes," as you hope God will forgive yours? And after all that you have done, or can do, do you look upon yourſelf as an unprofitable ſervant, and patiently wait for your reward, till God ſhall pleaſe, of his free grace, through Chriſt, to give it to you? If ſo, theſe graces and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences will prove you to be built on the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; they are among the gold, ſilver and precious ſtones, which compoſe the ſpiritual building; but they are not your foundation; that is <hi>more precious</hi> ſtill, for it is the tried ſtone, which God himſelf has
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024089_0030_0FC3326FF5506448"/>
laid in Zion. But if you are ſupporting yourſelf with a notion that you have had ſuch and ſuch experiences in time paſt, and are patching up a righteouſneſs out of them; if you imagine you were once converted, and that all has been well with you ſince, though you have lived in the neglect of known duty, and the commiſſion of known ſin, without remorſe of conſcience, or deſign of amendment; if evil habits are gaining ſtrength, and your corruptions are yet unmortified; if you are impatient of reproof, and unwilling to receive correction; if you are offended when your experiences are called in queſtion; if you are angry with ſuch preaching as ſerves to diſturb the repoſe of your mind, and ſhake the foundation on which you are building; then all your pretended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences are no better than "filthy rags," in which you are trying to hide your ſhame; they are but as a foundation of ſand, and all that you build upon it will fall into ruin; and the ſooner it falls, the better it will be for you. May God grant you wiſdom to diſcover the weakneſs of your foundation, and lead you to the "Rock of Ages," on which alone you can build with any hopes of ſafety.</p>
            <p>Finally, Let us be thankful to God for Jeſus Chriſt, the only foundation which he has laid; and for the abundant evidence which he has given us of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of his character, the perfection of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, the acceptance of his ſacrifice, the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his interceſſion, and the future glory of his kingdom. On him, as our foundation, let us build our faith, our hope, our profeſſion, our obedience, and our experience. We muſt not pretend to hold the foundation, unleſs we are building thereon; for a foundation is of no uſe but to build upon. Having therefore begun at the right foundation, let us be
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024089_0031_0FC33274ADFE0470"/>
careful that our ſtructure conſiſt of the beſt materials, and avoid, as much as poſſible, all impure and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable mixtures. And if we are building on this foundation, we ſhall have all his glorious perfections engaged for us; his wiſdom to direct us, his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to juſtify us, his power to defend us, and his grace to beſtow on us a full reward—when he "ſhall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire." Then, our building, though imperfect, will abide the trial, all our errors and infirmities will be purged away, and our virtuous habits will be carried to perfection.</p>
