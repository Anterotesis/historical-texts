         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was a ſad and awful Expoſtulation ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the holy Prophet, in Jer. 14.19 <hi>Haſt thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy Soul loathed Zion? Why haſt thou ſmitten us and there is no healing for us? We looked for Peace and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble</hi>; Hence the ſame Prophet gives vent to his pent up grief, by ſaying, <hi>When I would comfort my ſelf againſt ſorrow, my heart is faint in me; the Harveſt is paſt, the Summer is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we are not healed; for the hurt of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my People, I am hurt, I am black, Aſtoniſment hath taken hold upon me: Is there no Balm in Gilead? Is there no Phyſician there?</hi> Jer. 8.18, 20, 21, 22. Our Text preſents a rich and royal Cordial that may revive the drooping Spirits of God's Children when his backſlidden People among whom they live, are by their own Sins, &amp; God's judgments

Iſa. 48.I7. <hi>I am the Lord thy God which teacheth thee to Profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou ſhouldſt go.</hi> There is a (<hi>Manutenentiu Dei</hi>) an inviſible Hand-holding of God, by which the whole viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creation is Supported and Conducted; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no Creature could hold on in the way of Nature; much more is there an inviſible Hand-holding of God, by which the Spiritual creation is Supported &amp; Conducted; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the new Creature cannot hold on in the ways of Grace.

            <p n="4">4. The Effect of it, is comfort to him and to his Mourners. It implys the removal of the anguiſh and ſorrow following Sin; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring comfort and conſolation upon them and

their Mourners; that is, ſuch as Mourn over the ſin, rebellion and obſtinacy of this froward Peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple, and ſympathize with them in their deep diſtreſs. God has ſome Mourners in the worſt of times, that are faithful with God, Ezek. 9.4, 6. Theſe God will take care of in time of general judgment, to comfort theſe Mourners; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point unto them that Mourn in Zion, <hi>to give unto them beauty for aſhes, the oyl of Joy for Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs, that they might be called trees of righteouſneſs the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Lord, that he may be glorifyed,</hi> Iſai. 61.2, 3.</p>
            <p>The DOCTRINE from the words is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> When God has a deſign of Love to a Perſon or Province, He will Obſerve their Wayes in order to their healing, He will lead them alſo, and reſtore Comforts to them and to their Mourners.</p>
            <p>When there is a Patient dangerouſly Sick, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a purpoſe of Gods Love, God Himſelf will be his Phyſician. Thus it was with Iſrael in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah's time, when God ſaid to her why cryeſt thou for thine affliction? thy ſorrow is incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the multitude of thine iniquity: becauſe thy ſins were increaſed, I have done theſe things unto thee. I will reſtore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, faith the Lord, becauſe they call thee an out-caſt, ſaying, This is Zion, whom no man ſeeketh after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As if God
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001529_0008_0FB39D5234F40F90"/>
had ſaid, true indeed your caſe is in it ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, but for this cauſe I will undertake thy Cure, I have a remedy for the worſt of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies; Here we have God's Cure of <hi>Zion,</hi> when incurably Wounded; Now God will apply a <hi>Sanative Cataplaſm,</hi> a Healing Plaiſter: This is Repentance, and Reſtitution, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.15, 17. [Thus Excellent Mr. Norton diſcants upon theſe words in his Election Sermon.] So, Iſai. 43.25. <hi>I even I am he that bloteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> To whom is this promiſe made? See 22, 23. <hi>verſes.</hi> They were ſuch as had either neglected or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Service of God and Divine Worſhip, and were refractory in it; yet God brings in this promiſe, I that am thus ſlighted, thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, <hi>Will blot out your iniquities,</hi> Iſai. 30.17, 18.</p>
            <p>For the clearing up of the Doctrine, take two Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>GOD ſees and obſerves the ways of his profeſſing Declining People to whom He has a deſign of Love.</hi>

            <p>Take two Poſitions here.</p>
            <p>Poſ. 1. <hi>The wayes of a People are either Internal or External.</hi> The Internal ways of a People are the ways of their heart, as in our Context, Iſa. 57.I7, <hi>He went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</hi> And theſe ways of the heart, their inward ways, are, their Thoughts, what they imagine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: Their Affections, what they love, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001529_0009_0FB39D5479ADCAF8"/>
what they hate, what they rejoyce in, and what they Mourn for, declare the way of their heart. The ways of their heart are their purpoſes, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and intentions what to do. Yea, the ways of their heart are their deſigns or aims, what they drive at, or propoſe as their end in all that they do. Theſe Internal ways of a People are ſeen &amp; obſerved by God: Joh. 2.25. <hi>He needed not that any ſhould teſtify of man; for he knew what was in man.</hi> And God ſees and obſerves the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ways of a People. Yea if we take the ways of a People as differenced in their kinds, as they are either good or evil; the Eyes of the Lord are upon both. <hi>They are</hi> (ſaith Solomon Prov. 15.3.) <hi>in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</hi> Hence what ever is done in the World, falls under the notice and cognizance of God, He that looketh to the ends of the earth, and ſeeth under the whole heaven, cannot but take notice of all that is done, or comes to paſs all the world over, <hi>Job</hi> 28.24. The Lord beholds all things diſtinctly; not in groſs only or in a lump; He beholds the leaſt as well as the greateſt; He looks upon every parcel, and opens the whole pack and bundle of humane affairs; Perſonal, Domeſtick, Civil, Sacred, Military. He beholds every thing, and Perſon, People and Province perfectly, fully, quite through; He that is All Eye ſeeth all at once, all as one. Acts 15.18. <hi>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</hi> He is Omniſcient, and Omnipreſent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.

1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, I0, 11, 12. <hi>This Thought</hi> ſhould repreſs all tumultuatings of Spirit in Gods Children in the greateſt Worldly tumults and viciſſitudes, Pſal 46.10. <hi>Be ſtill and know that I am God.</hi> Men are not GOD, they cannot ſee what to do; nor do what they ſee. But I who am GOD can ſee under the whole heaven what is doing, and what to do; and I can do whatſoever I ſee needful to be done. Therefore be ſtill, be not ye hurried either with <hi>diſcontents</hi> at what is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor with <hi>fear</hi> of what may be done; for, know I am GOD, I look to the ends of the earth, and what I ſay <hi>muſt</hi> be done; and what is <hi>juſt</hi> for all men, and <hi>beſt</hi> for you who are my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhall be done. Here's the true ground of courage, and of quietneſs: Pſal. 46.1, 2 <hi>God is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, therefore will not we fear, though the earth be moved,</hi> &amp;c, They that fear God, have no reaſon either to be <hi>afraid,</hi> or to be <hi>diſcontended.</hi> He, that looks to the ends of the earth and ſees their wayes, and the ways of all the Children of men; is their Friend and their Father; therefore he will look to them, and ſee that all ſhall go well with them, or end well for them.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The firſt Diſeaſe is Covetouſneſs. Iſa 57.17. <hi>For the iniquity of his covetouſneſs was I wroth, and ſmote him. Alii Cupid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For from the leaſt of them even unto the greateſt of them, every one is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Covetouſneſs: Jer.8.10. Iſa. 56.11. <hi>Yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough; they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</hi> Indeed, Covetouſneſs knows no bounds. As it hath been ſaid of Envy, ſo we may ſay of Covetouſneſs, Covetouſneſ, whether wilt thou? whether wilt thou lead, or rather hurry and force worldly men? Covetouſneſs carries thoſe who are under the power of it, no man knows whether: who can tell where he ſhall ſtop or ſtay when he is once under the power of the Spirit of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? A Covetous man is an unſatiable gulf, he always dreams of dearths, and ſuſpects the earth will be barren: with theſe fears he pines, yea

Martyrs himſelf, and is not at all enriched with all his riches. There is no Sin ſo hainous, none ſo baſe, and for did, but Covetouſneſs may be both the Mother and Nurſe of it. When the Spirit of a Man is once embaſed by Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he is ready to do any baſe thing. Hence the Apoſtle concludes (1 Tim. 6.10) <hi>That the love of Money</hi> (which is Covetouſneſs) <hi>is the root of all evil</hi>; that is, any evil of Sin may grow up from that root; It will, as occaſion ſerves, lead forth to all wickedneſs; To Idolatry, Hereſy, Witchcraft, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14, This will move men to rob God in tithes, and offerings; Profane Gods Name, Pollute Gods Sanctuary, break his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath's, diſhonour Father and Mother, Steal, Kill, commit Filthyneſs bear falſe Witneſs, break the whole Law, and Violate the Goſpel; Sell and Betray, as <hi>Judas</hi> did, their very Saviour, and deareſt Intereſt, for the World: Oh how full is the Womb of this Sin, of all Abomination? Covetouſneſs is Idolatry, and the Covetous man is an Idolater, Eph. 5.5, 6. <hi>Origen,</hi> faith well, when he ſays, <hi>Thou Chriſtian muſt not only circumciſe thy heart from Worſhipping Idols, as thou didſt at firſt; but farther you muſt be circumciſed from Covetouſneſs, which is a more Subtile kind of Idolatry.</hi> Indeed, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs carries in it a double Idolatry.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi> He went on frowardly in the way of his heart, Iſa 57.17. <hi>Oſtendit Judaeos deſperatos eſſe, quod extrema remedia illos non reduxerint in viam.</hi> A Diſeaſe ſometimes is ſo deſperate, no Phyſician will undertake its cure; the Patient ſo froward and unruly, that none will meddle with him: The ſtate of this Patient is ſuch that reſiſts all the applications of God for his heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he is the worſe rather than the better for all: He goes on frowardly, ſo that it is a Patient that refuſeth to return; they were impenitent in Sin; now impenitency in any Sin, makes it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate: as the Prophet Jeremiah ſets this forth in a bright Example, Jer. 8.5. <hi>Why is this People of Jeruſalem ſlidden back, by a perpetual back ſliding; they hold faſt deceit, they refuſe to return</hi>: Here are three phraſes noting this one thing.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001529_0015_0FB39D61999B4470"/>
Why is this People of Jeruſalem ſlidden back by a <hi>conquering,</hi> or <hi>prevailing</hi> back ſliding? Their diſtemper conquered and prevailed, againſt all ordinary Medicines &amp; Methods of cure. Now, How many ſad Symptoms of this diſtemper are to be found upon <hi>New-England</hi> at this day, is ground of Soul-ſearch. Whether we do not go on frowardly in the way of our own heart Notwithſtanding all ordinary Means and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines uſed for our recovery? Whether <hi>New-Englands</hi> Spiritual and Political Wounds &amp; Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are not grown ſo immedical and incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they are paſt ordinary hope of healing? And whether this People are not in Extream danger of periſhing in their own Sins, and under Gods Judgments, Temporal and Spiritual? Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God in rich Mercy become our Healer and Phyſician. Which leads me to the Second Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>

               <hi>PROP. II.</hi> Now at this Critical juncture when the Diſeaſe is ſo near it's Criſis, this Alſufficient Phyſician undertakes the Cure, and Reſolves to Heal by the bright diſplay of Sovereign Grace, He will lead him alſo, and reſtore comforts unto him and to his Mourners.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:001529_0016_0FB39D62B38D6EF8"/>When there is nothing to be found amongſt this miſerable People but that which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to bring ſpeedy and inevitable Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Then this moſt compaſſionate Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an can and doth find an Argument in himſelf to move him to heal and help at this Juncture, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>The LORD will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his People, for his great Name ſake; becauſe it hath plaeſed the Lord to make you His People. Not for your ſakes do I this ſaith the Lord, O houſe of Iſrael, but for mine holy Name ſake,</hi> Ezek. 36.22, 32.</p>
            <p>Here take three Poſitions, for the clearing up of this Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Poſition is, <hi>That now at this Critical juncture when the diſeaſe is ſo near it's Criſis, This Alſufficient Phyſician undertakes the Cure, and Reſolves to Heal by the bright diſplay of Soveraign Grace and Rich Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Be the diſeaſe what it will, whether a diſtemper upon the Soul, or upon the body, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Perſon or Province; This Phyſician can make an agreeable application to them for their Healing: 1 King. 8.37, 38, 39. <hi>If there be in the Land Famine, if there be Peſtilence, blaſting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpillar, if their enemy beſiege them in the Land of their Cities, whatſoever Plague, whatſoever Sickneſs there be</hi>: The Expreſſion is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding full and comprehenſive, ſo that no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nor People have room left to ſay, there is no mention of my caſe, condition or miſery; God comprehends them all in this expreſſion, (<hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Plague or Sickneſs it is</hi>) whether more Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001529_0017_0FB39D6471CF4C08"/>
from Gods hand, or more mediately by Second cauſes, inward or outward Sickneſs, this Phyſician can work a thorow cure Our dear Lord Chriſt when here, healed all manner of Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp; all manner of diſeaſe among the People, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.23 &amp; 9.35. And he is now as able and willing to heal and help, as when he was here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. Hence it is neither the Greatneſs of the Sickneſs and Sin, nor the want of a Remedy, or a Skilful Compaſſionate Phyſician, that kills the Patient: but it is his not Accepting of Healing Medicine; His not ſtooping to the Remedy, his non-compliance with this Phyſician in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he preſcribes to him for his cure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He Heals by the bright diſplay of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Grace and Rich Mercy. This Grace of God is God able and willing freely to diſpoſe of Spiritual good unto his Creature, tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and deſerving ill from him. And this Mercy of God, is God Able and Willing to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour the Creature in Miſery. Now this Grace and Mercy may be conſidered either as it is in God, and ſo reſpects his Divine Sufficiency: Or, as it flows from God, and ſo reſpects his Divine Efficiency: Hence it may be conſidered either in the Degree and Purpoſe to give Grace and ſhew Mercy, which is Increated Grace &amp; Mercy: Or in the actual accompliſhment and execution of that decree by Providence; which is created Grace and Mercy, and is the actual Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his purpoſe by his Providence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001529_0018_0FB39D65B23228A0"/>Now as Miſery is the Object of Mercy, ſo Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs is the Object of Grace; Hence this Miſerable and Unworthy Patient is an Agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Object for the Great God to diſplay his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Grace &amp; rich Mercy upon, and toward in healing of him <hi>then</hi> when the caſe ſeems to be deſperate: He needs common and ſpecial Mercy to be extended to him in his deep miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; Common Mercy manifeſts it ſelf, either in Creation or Providence: Common Mercy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by Divine Efficiency diſplaying it ſelf in Providence, is Gods Actual communication of Mercy unto, and providing ſuitable Mercy for his Creatures according to their various neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And this ſhews it ſelf in Conſervation, and Gubernation; and this miſerable Patient needs Mercy in each of theſe reſpects. <hi>Diſcimus hinc, ſalutis noſtrae initium eſſe miſericordiam Dei,</hi> faith a good Divine. Yea he needs ſpecial Mercy to ſhew it ſelf in the great works of Redemption, and the Application of Redemption unto him, whereby he may be fitted for full and compleat Glorification.</p>
            <p>Hence the Effectual Application of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Saving Converſion is ſtiled an act of Mercy and Divine Commiſeration. 1 Pet. 2.9, 10. <hi>Ye are a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſt-hood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People; that ye ſhould ſhew forth the Praiſes of him, who hath called you out of darkneſs into his marvellous light: which in time paſt were not a People, but are now the People of God: which had
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001529_0019_0FB39D6A081DBE58"/>
not obtained Mercy, but now have obtained Mercy.</hi> The Elect are called (and by Effectual Calling ſo made) <hi>veſſels of Mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.2. So <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Adoption, Sanctification,</hi> and in the end <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification,</hi> are fruits and effects of ſpecial Mercy. And this Patient ſtands in need of all this Mercy.</p>
            <p>Moreover, This Unworthy Patient ſtands in need of the bright and ſhining diſplay of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Grace, not only to bring him <hi>into,</hi> but to <hi>continue</hi> him in the favour of God. Our Divines truly ſay, That God in the work of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has inſtamped upon the Regenerate the work of his Grace which indureth for ever; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what is written in, 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is born of God, doth not commit ſin; for his Seed remaineth in him.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. <hi>Being born again not of corruptible Seed but of Incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and abideth for ever</hi>: Yet notwithſtanding this Principle of Grace, if God withdraw his Aſſistance, it would all come to nothing; and therefore there is need of this Grace of God; according as it is graciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them, that I will not turn away from them to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea he needs the Grace of God to continue him under the Actual influences of the favour of God: Gods own Children may be Children <hi>under Wrath,</hi> tho' not Children <hi>of Wrath</hi>; it muſt
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001529_0020_0FB39D6BDCCAF8C0"/>
be the Grace of God that can keep them in the Actual favour of God.</p>
            <p>In a word, he needs the Grace of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him from his falls, and to keep him from falling, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. As it is the Lord that giveth Repentance at the firſt, ſo it is God that muſt give Repentance afterward. Acts 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his Right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give Repentance to Iſrael, and forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This Almighty Phyſician undertakes the Cure <hi>Now</hi> at this Critical juncture, when the Diſeaſe is ſo near its Criſis, That He may make the more bright and ſhining diſplay of his own Glory. The glory of the Phyſician, and the more of his skill appears when the Caſe is thus deſperate; His Wiſdom, His Grace, His Mercy Appears the more ſignal in his looking after ſuch an one, as had no will to look after Him; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' he was gaſping for life, and muſt inevitably Dy unleſs this compaſſionate Phyſician ſpeedily ſteps in to his help. And truly, when we are caſt in Common Law, what have we to hope in but Prerogative Mercy? When good men in all Orders find all attempts to recover a Backſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den People awfully to be fruſtrated, needs muſt they ſink in deſpondency, and loſe their Faith and Hope, did they not encourage them by this conſideration, that as God can, ſo <hi>He</hi> frequently doth, take ſuch an Opportunity to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known; and ſo have the whole Glory of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001529_0021_0FB39D6D40C75740"/>
ſuch a Peoples Salvation aſcribed to him. Pſal. 106.8. <hi>Nevertheleſs, He Saved them for his Name ſake: that he might make his mighty Power to be known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea this Almighty Phyſician undertakes the Cure <hi>Now</hi> at this Critical juncture, when the Diſeaſe is ſo deſperate, to humble the Patient. O how will this humble the Patient and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Phyſician, when he muſt acknowledge his Diſtemper to be ſo immedical that it had not been cured, had not God done it; <hi>He it was that brought me up out of an horrible put, out of the miry clay, and ſet my feet upon a rock, and eſtabliſhed my going,</hi> Pſal. 40.2. He muſt own that it is of the Lords Mercy that he is not conſumed, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his compaſſions fail not, <hi>They are new every Morning: great is his faithfulneſs,</hi> Lam. 3.22, 23.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I proceed to ſhow the way of Gods Cure of this ſick Patient, be it Perſon or Province; and the uſual Method which God takes for his Healing (tho' we may not limit him who is the Abſolute Soveraign of Heaven and Earth, and Heals when he pleaſeth, whom He pleaſeth, and in what way He pleaſeth) yet Gods Ordinary way of working lyes here.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) God diſcovers to them the evil of their own wayes; He makes them feel the ſmart, and be ſenſible of the danger of their own ſickneſs, I <hi>King.</hi> 8.38. They ſee and know the Plague of their own heart. God diſcovers to them the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001529_0022_0FB39D6EC4AEEDC8"/>
Malignity and Danger of their Diſeaſe; it is a Plague and that in the heart; and will prove moſt deadly, if not prevented and healed. Rom. 6 23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> God will make them to ſee themſelves perishing, and dying Eternally, except the LORD under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for them. God makes them true Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Mourners, he breaks their hearts for, and effectually off from ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15, 16.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) God makes them to ſee their own ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to heal themſelves, and that no created Phyſician can cure them. This diſeaſe blinds the Underſtanding, makes the Will rebellious, wounds the Conſcience, diſorders the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſtempers the whole man; ſo that they have no power to help themſelves; They are bed-rid Creatures, not able to ſtir or look out for a Cure; They know not the way of Peace; They have dexterity to deſtroy themſelves, not to help themſelves; They can neither find out a remedy, nor Apply the remedy when it is found out, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.2.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) In order to the healing of this Patient (be it Perſon or Province) God diſcovers the excellency of the remedy which He has provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for their recovery. He has laid help upon One that is Mighty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19. He has <hi>ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh but have eternal life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. There is no want of Skill or Will in this good and great Phyſician.

            <p>Here conſider two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is no want of <hi>Skill</hi> in this good and great Phyſician : He is cloathed with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ability and Mediatorial Sufficiency to work a thorow Care upon thoſe that by Faith repair to Him for healing: He is the true <hi>Immanuel,</hi> the Word made fleſh, the Man Gods Fellow, a

Royal Prieſt, a Prieſtly Prophet, and a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical King all in One.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) That there is no want or Skill in this good and great Phyſician appears, in that He is true God and true Man in One Perſon. He is very God, not a Metaphorical, but the True God, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 5.20. Not a God by <hi>Office,</hi> but a God by <hi>Nature, Jer.</hi> 23 6. This is his Name where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhall be called, <hi>JEHOVAH tſidkenu, The LORD our Righteouſneſs.</hi> Tho' not Son of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> as to his Subſtance, yet God of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as to his Eſſence: Gods Name is in him, <hi>Exod</hi> 23 21. The Great Letters of that Name are, the <hi>Divine Attributes</hi>: Now who is Sufficient to work a perfect cure, if the CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATOR be not? Certainly his Omnipatency is the beſt <hi>Salve</hi> for the Creatures Impotency; His <hi>All</hi> for our nothingneſs.</p>
            <p>Yea that there is no want of skill in this Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician appears, in that He is ſo nearly joyned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; He that is able and ſufficient to work Salvation for us muſt be a Perſon conjunct with us, and ſo was Chriſt; He was our Goel, our next Kinſman by his Incarnation, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer by his Paſſion; He aſſumed our Nature into Himſelf, that he might Redeem us. <hi>Job.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The WORD was made Fleſh.</hi> All other Creations are (as it were) <hi>extra Deum,</hi> but here was a Creation in the very Perſon of God. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Son of God Eſpouſed fleſh and bloud, and the Bride chamber (as a Learned Divine faith)
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001529_0025_0FB39D7720BBA380"/>
where the knot was tyed, was the Virgins Womb: There was He made of a Woman, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial with us, as to his Humanity; who was Conſubſtantial with the Father, as to his Divinity.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) That there is no want of skill in this good and great Phyſician appears, in that he has in Himſelf a fulneſs of All Increated and Created Wiſdom and Skill. Col. 1.19. <hi>It pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell.</hi> God is only Wiſe and Skilful, becauſe all Wiſdom and Skill is from Him, as He hath Wiſdom and Skill of and from Himſelf, ſo all others have Wiſdom and Skill from Him, it is, but a drop from this Ocean: Wiſdom and Skill is either Created or Increated; Created Wiſdom and Skill is from God whether it be Theological, Civil or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical. Dan. 2.21. <hi>God giveth Wiſdom to the wiſe, and knowledge to them that know underſtanding.</hi> Hence Chriſt our Phyſician hath skill enough to cure and heal the greateſt Maladies, the moſt incurable Diſeaſes; whether they be Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtempers or bodily diſtreſſes; whether they be Political or Eccleſiaſtical Wounds and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, That there is no want of <hi>Will</hi> in this good &amp; great Phyſician to Heal all thoſe given to Him by the Father, in the Covenant of Redemption: Hence,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Chriſt did not only cloath Himſelf with Humanity, but became their Sponſor or Surety,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001529_0026_0FB39D7969164B98"/>
and ſo in Law One Perſon with them, whom the Father had given to Him in the Covenant of Redemption, That He might be their Healer and Phyſician. He doth not only plead their cauſe, but pay their Debts: Chriſt entred into Bond for them, and took all their Debts and Duties whatſoever they owe to God, upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſee all performed; that they might go free and be accepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. Hence Chriſt did undertake as in their Nature, ſo in their Name, and did reſtipulate with God on their behalf, That whatſoever was owing to his Juſtice and Holineſs by them, either as a penalty for paſt defaults, or a duty to preſent Commands, ſhould all be ſatisfyed and performed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, i'le lay down my life, I'le pour out my Soul, (<hi>ſaith Chriſt</hi>) let all the wrath due to them be ſqueezed into one Cup, and I'le drink it up to the bottom: Let the fire of Gods anger drop down from Heaven, and I'le be the <hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> roaſted in it; Thus willing was this great and gracious Phyſician to Heal this Periſhing Patient, <hi>That He Dy's that the Patient might live</hi>: Thus our Lord Chriſt this Compaſſionate Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician was ſo Willing to <hi>Heal</hi> and <hi>Help</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, That He becomes his Surety and was One with Him in Nature, that He might be One with Him in Law too.</p>
            <p>Yea his Willingneſs to heal and help, is Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by what He has done and ſuffered, to purchaſe and procure their healing; He has
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001529_0027_0FB39D7AB8F348E0"/>
by his Obedience unto Death ſatisfyed Divine Juſtice to the full; His Obedience was a fair Commentary on the whole Law, written in glorious Characters of Holineſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs all his life long, and at his Death Sealed up and Claſped with his precious blood. <hi>He was</hi> (ſaith a Worthy Divine) <hi>as it were in pangs of forward Obedience to be Baptized in his own blood, and poſted on towards an Agony of Wrath in an Agony of Love</hi>: and when he Arrived at his extreameſt Sufferings, His Signal Willingneſs turned his Suffering into Doing, and his Croſs into a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Chariot; He Triumphed in it, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. Even there his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Love rod in Triumph; Triumphant Obedience ſpread out his hands upon the Croſs, and Triumphant love Opened his naked heart to the wrath of God.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Now that He may Apply this rich Remedy for the thorow <hi>Cure</hi> of this diſtreſt Patient, He puts his Spirit into him whereby he cauſeth him to live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.14. And indeed the great Work of the Spirit which he hath to do for the Cure of this Patient, It is to apply Redemption to him in the whole compaſs of it; and ſo to cauſe him to walk in Gods Statutes, and keep his Judgments, and do them, which he cannot poſſibly do without the Spirit. The whole work of Application in the whole life of a Chriſtian, in Grace and Glory, is from the Spirit; It is the work of the Spirit to convince a Perſon
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001529_0028_0FB39D7C6BE0B250"/>
or People of Sin, Righteouſneſs and Judgment. The Preparatory as well as the Saving work is wrought by the Spirit; He works both to will and to do, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. Yea he works All the good pleaſure of Gods will in a Perſon or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the work of faith with Power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. It is the work of the Spirit to form Chriſt in the Soul, and to create it in Chriſt unto love and good works: Eph. 2:10. <hi>For we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> God hath made a Promiſe unto Chriſt and unto Us in Chriſt of his Spirit, which muſt be fulfilled, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.20, 21. The Spirit muſt be put within his People in order to their Saving Converſion thro' Reformation, and future ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rnal Salvation; and for this he ordained the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the New Teſtament to be a Means to convey the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. Yea one of the greateſt bleſſings promiſed in the Covenant of Grace, is, <hi>That the Lord will pour his Spirit upon the Children and Poſterity of his Servants,</hi> Iſai. 44.3. Oh then! Let this move All true Chriſtians to engage their very Souls in Prayer to God for his Spirit, That may heal all our Spiritual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, our Political and Eccleſiaſtical Sickneſſes: if there be any ſtrength for wreſtling with God left, improve all the Intereſt you have with God, and with his Son, that you may prevail for this Bleſſing, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would pleaſe to put his Spirit into us and cauſe us to live.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001529_0029_0FB39D7DB64D5A18"/>I proceed to the Second Poſition, which I muſt but name,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Poſition. <hi>This Great and Gracious Phyſician will lead this weak and feeble Patient.</hi> He is indeed ſo weak by reaſon of his long-languiſhing-Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, That he cannot go nor ſtand alone; But this Phyſician lends him his helping hand, by cauſing him according to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit in the Inner-man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. Yea he cauſeth his Grace <hi>in</hi> him, and his Grace <hi>with</hi> him to be ſufficient for him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.

            <p>I now proceed to the Improvement of this Doctrine, [I.] By way of <hi>Inference.</hi> [II.] By way of <hi>Exhertatian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Inference. <hi>See hence then the inconceivable Malignity of the Deadly Diſeaſe of Sin.</hi> Sin it is an Infinite evil, Objectively Infinite; 'tis a fighting againſt an Infinite Majeſty, a ſtriving againſt
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001529_0030_0FB39D8040538AB8"/>
Infinite Soveraignty; an Enmity to Infinite Holineſs, a provocation to Infinite Juſtice, a <hi>Deicidium,</hi> a ſtriking at the very Life and Being of GOD Himſelf; God hath no other oppoſite but Sin Sin is ſuch a Mortal Contagion as has infected the whole race of Man-kind proceeding from Adam by Natural Generation; This has open'd the Door to All Sorrow and Suffering, Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal; that Perſons, Families, Churches, Provinces, Kingdoms; yea, the whole world have been, and at this Day are Entertained with: It is a diſeaſe that none but God can cure; It is good to be Sick <hi>of</hi> Sin; but to be Sick <hi>by</hi> it, is moſt Mortal, except this Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician undertake the cure: Nothing can cure this Sickneſs, but Unſearchable riches of Divine Grace. As the wrong and offence is, ſuch muſt the Compenſation be: the former is infinite, therefore the latter muſt not be finite. Hence there is only in Chriſt a Divine Ability and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Sufficiency to work Salvation: <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other: for there is none other Name under Heaven given among men whereby we muſt be Saved,</hi> Acts 4.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Inference. <hi>See hence then what cauſe</hi> New-England, <hi>and this Province in particular has to ly in the duſt before the Lord this Day, under the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumbling ſenſe of our many Sickneſſes, and loathſome Diſeaſes.</hi> What Political and Eccleſiaſtical Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are there amongſt us? The good Lord

grant that <hi>New-England</hi> may never have that bitter complaint entred againſt it; which the great God once drew up againſt Judah and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Saying, <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more, ye will revolt more and more: the whole head is Sick and the whole heart faint. From the ſole of the foot even unto the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it; but wounds, and bruiſes, and putrifying ſores: they have not been cloſed, neither bound up, neither mollifyed with Oyntment,</hi> Iſa. 1.5, 6. How do our Sickneſſes grow upon us? How are we wounding our ſelves, and like to undoe our ſelves, if Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy prevent not? How does Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Immorality increaſe amongſt us?

What Exceſſive Tipling and Drinking, which like a Flood even drowns much of Chriſtianity in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Places?

His Excellency the GOVERNOUR, Council and Aſſembly (then being) of this Province, who did more than Seven years ago, rightly <q>judge it abſolutely neceſſary for them, the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Repreſentatives of this People, then to Publiſh unto this Province, the ſorrows and diſires of their hearts, as a Teſtimony before Heaven and Earth, that the deſired REFOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MATION might be vigorousſly proſecuted.</q>
Has this Province hearkened to the Call of God by the Call of thoſe our Pious Rulers? Are thoſe Vices and Immoralities (then Teſtifyed againſt) Lamented and Reformed by this People?

            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

Hoſ. 14.4. <hi>I will heal their back ſliding, I will love them freely,</hi> Jer. 3.22. Hoſ. 11.8, 9.</p>
            <p>The Phyſician that undertakes the cure, is moſt Excellent; It is our dear Lord CHRIST, who has cured all manner of Sickneſſes, and all manner of Diſeaſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. His Grace toward the Diſeaſed (that come to Him for Healing) is ſo tranſcendent, that it triumphs over all the Unworthineſs of the Patient (be it Perſon or Province) and will Heal him, tho' many ſtops ly in the way; Pſal. 106.7, 8. <hi>They underſtood not his works, they remembred not the multitude of his Mercies; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled at the Sea, even at the red Sea.</hi> Every one of theſe were as a ſtop in the way of Healing, yet Mercy got over them all; Nevertheleſs he Saved them. Now as the Grace of this Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Phyſician triumphs over the Unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this diſtreſt Patient that applies to Him for a Cure; ſo Mercy triumphs over all the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities and Impoſſibilities that ſeem to ly in the way of this Phyſician, to hinder him from working a thorow cure.</p>

               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:001529_0037_0FB39D8E54953DC8"/>And in the firſt Place I take leave humbly to propoſe this <hi>Exhortation</hi> to Your EXCEL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENCY, and unto thoſe who are, or may be of the Honourable COUNCIL: Together with thoſe Worthy <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that <hi>Repreſent</hi> the People of this Province in a General Aſſembly, who have ordered me (tho' moſt unworthy) into this awful Desk at this time.</p>
            <p>Suffer your Selves to be Intreated, in the Name of the Lord, and by this word of the Lord, to be Encouraged; to go on in your Excellent and Diſtinguiſhing Prudence and Integrity, to Write after this Divine Copy, in doing your Utmoſt, in your reſpective Poſts, for the Healing of the Wounds and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of this Diſtreſt &amp; Diſtemper'd Province. Be intreated to undertake and carry on your whole Healing work, in all your Prudent and Skilful Applications of proper Medicines for the Cure of this People and Province, in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Government, both by Legiſlation and Execution; and in the management of all the Great Affairs of the Publick Weal of this People of God, which you are by Him betruſted with the Cure of, by a very powerful Exerciſe of faith, in this Alſufficient Phyſician, for the thorow Cure of this People, That GOD may be intreated to ſay to <hi>New-England,</hi> and this Province in particular, as in our Text, <hi>I have ſeen his ways and I will heal him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:001529_0038_0FB39D90DE808090"/>True indeed, it is Gods Prerogative royal to Heal &amp; Cure our incurable Wounds &amp; Sickneſſes by the bright and ſhining diſplay of his Soveraign Grace and rich Mercy; yet it has pleaſed His Divine Majeſty to commit this Healing Work into your hands, as you are our Excellent and Honourable Rulers.</p>
            <p>The Wounds of the Body Politick need a Healer, as much as thoſe of the Body Natural. Rulers are State-Phyſicians: Hence the word rendred to Govern, hath a three-fold ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture. Firſt, and moſt properly, to bind up. Secondly, by a Metaphor, to Heal; becauſe there is ſo great a uſe of binding in Healing; the skilful Ligature of a Wound, or of a broken Limb, is of ſo much conſequence in Chyrurgery, or the Art of Healing, that binding alone is put for Healing: That which is well bound, is in a fair way to Healing. We find both theſe acts put together in that great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Churches Glory under the Goſpel, Iſai. 30.26. <hi>Moreover, the light of the moon ſhall be as the light of the ſun, and the light of the ſun ſhall be ſeven fold, as the light of ſeven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his People, and healeth the ſtroke of their wound</hi> And <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3.7. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the word ſignifies Tropically, to Rule or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and the reaſon ariſeth clearly from the proper ſignification of it; Becauſe He that is a Ruler, is alſo a binder and a healer. This then
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001529_0039_0FB39D91F819D4E8"/>
(Worthy Patriots) may give direction to ſuch whoſe Province it is this Day to Chooſe and Appoint the Perſons that are to bear Rule over this People; whatſoever other Rules diſcretion may point to be obſerved in this affair; yet this may not be neglected by the Electors, That they chooſe ſuch Perſons as they really Judge duely Qualifyed, who do give grounded Hopes that they will Approve themſelves <hi>State-Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> Rightly skill'd, and agreeably will'd, to do their utmoſt to Bind and Heal the Wounds and Sickneſſes of this diſeaſed People, by their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> and by their Encouraging of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Equity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rulers bind the People that are under them, to Order: They bind them by their Laws: Laws are bonds, they have a binding Power, they bind either to Obedience or to Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And therefore Rulers are binders, they bind the Unruly and diſobedient; They bind with the Rule of the Law, and with the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Law: When any break the Rule of the Law, then they fall under the Penalties of the Law; ſo that every way a Ruler is a Binder; and as He is a Binder, ſo a Healer: The Laws of Government by which People are bound, are for their healing: for the healing of their manners and corruptions; As alſo, for the healing of thoſe whom they have oppreſſed or wounded by their Evil Manners and Corruptions, LAWS are the Security of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
pie,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001529_0040_0FB39D937681E350"/>
the Security of their Perſons, of their Eſtates, of their Credit, and of their Liberties Civil, and Religious, and of their Lives. Some have well compared Laws to Phyſick, which doth both prevent and remove thoſe Diſeaſes which are incident to the whole body of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Province. Now as Magiſtracy conſiſts in an Authority to make and conſtitute Laws: ſo in an Authority to apply, actuate or execute them in all particular Caſes and Emergencies. <hi>A Law Unexecuted</hi> (ſaith a good Divine) <hi>is like a Sealed Book, or like a Sword lock'd up in the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>May it then pleaſe Your EXCELLENCY and our Honourable and Worthy Senators in your great Prudence to Conſider, whether there be nothing farther to be done either by <hi>Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Execution,</hi> for the Healing of this Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Province? And for the Maintaining Juſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men, and Piety toward God? Whether there be no ſtep farther to be taken to quicken under Officers, as <hi>Tything-men, Conſtables</hi> and <hi>Grand-jurors,</hi> to a more vigorous accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Promiſſory Oaths that Annually they take for the Suppreſſing of <hi>Intemperance,</hi> and <hi>Diſorders,</hi> that are ſo growing among us? Whether there be no ſtep farther to be taken for to prevent that Land deſolating Sin, of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the LORDS-DAY? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Law which refers to the breach of the Sabbath, and the Penalty Annexed there-unto,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001529_0041_0FB39D955D1C6098"/>
may not be reviewed, and the Sanctification of the Sabbath farther ſecured, and more ſtrongly guarded?</p>
            <p>If there be nothing farther to be done either by Legiſlation or Execution, for the Healing of our Wounds and Sickneſſes? Yet ſuffer me to ſay, There is encouragement to Addreſs the Compaſſionate and Alſufficient Phyſician by the <hi>Prayer of Faith,</hi> for Healing. This was the Method good King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> took for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his People, when he knew not what to do for their Cure; He by the Prayer of faith repaired to this moſt skilful Phyſician for a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-failing remedy, and in this way obtained it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20 12, 17, 20. The Effectual-ſervent Prayers of Pious Rulers for their Sick and Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed People, are a precious Means of a Peoples Healing. That is one good way of Seeking their Recovery, to ſet God on work by Prayer, and engage Him to be their Healer. When <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>z kiah</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> do both Cry and Pray to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there is good hopes it ſhall go well with that People, and that God will appear for them, as he did. 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 32.20, 21, 22. How oft did the Prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for Iſrael in the Wilderneſs, ſlip in between them &amp; deſtruction? <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.12, 13, 14 19, 20, 21, 22, 45. It was an Exemplary paſſage of that Worthy Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who when he had but one breath to draw, ſpent half of it on the People in Prayer
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001529_0042_0FB39D96706338E8"/>
for them, Crying (as he fell down ſlain) <hi>Oh my God take pity of my Soul, and of this poor People</hi>!</p>
            <p>Second Branch of EXHORTATION <hi>is to my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh be intreated in the bowels of Chriſt to go on vigorouſly in your conſtant painful, faithful Miniſterial Indeavours to heal the Wounds and Sickneſſes of this diſeaſed People. You are (<hi>Reverend Sirs</hi>) Spiritual Phyſicians by that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and Sacred Office you ſuſtain; and you are betruſted and awfully Charged with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial and Paſtoral Care and Cure of Souls. <hi>Paul</hi> had the care of all the Churches lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. And we muſt give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all thoſe Souls, that are committed by Chriſt (the Phyſician of Souls) unto our Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care and charge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. Oh! what need then have we to do our Utmoſt for the Healing and Curing of the <hi>Heart-Plagues,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Maladies</hi> of our <hi>Sick Churches</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,</hi> That ſo no Precious and Immortal SOUL may finally be loſt thro' our default; but that we may be free from the guilt of the bloud of Souls, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19, 20, 21. It is therefore our duty to Inculcate upon them their Malady, and to diſcover to them the Remedy. Oh! what need have we to take heed to our ſelves, and to the reſpective Flocks committed to us by the Holy Ghoſt, to feed them, and to give
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001529_0043_0FB39D98F8BE61E8"/>
them their Food and Phyſick in due ſeaſon, <hi>to Preach the Word, to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, to rebuke, reprove, exhort, with all long-ſuffering and doctrine; and to be an Example of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Word, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</hi> Now if we would thus be skilful, faithful and ſucceſsful Soul Phyſicians, we muſt indeavour to be filled with the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5 18. All Chriſtians muſt labour after this, but eſpecially Miniſters: There will be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our work as Chriſtians, or as Miniſters without the Inhabitation, and Saving operation of the Spirit: We ſhould therefore Earneſtly Pray, that we may be ſo filled with the Spirit, as that we may have ſo much of the Grace and gracious operation of the Spirit in us, as to inable us from an inward abiding Principle; To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all Myſteries Revealed, Imbrace all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Diſpence all Ordinances, Obey all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Improve with humble Submiſſion to Gods diſpoſing, all Providences to their end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea we ſhould Pray that we may be filled in the higheſt meaſure with the Spirit, to the meaſure of the fulneſs of the ſtatute of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. So filled, as to furniſh us here to all Goſpel-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and hereafter, to all Goſpel Glory.</p>

Provincial Healers, that may under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Alſufficient Phyſician, do their Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt for our Healing (the God of Wiſdom in His Infinite Mercy Direct the Electors, and the Elections:) But give me leave to ſay this one Word to all that are preſent before the Lord at this Time, that are ſenſible of the Plague of their own Hearts, <hi>You are Sick and need a Phyſician, and are now put upon your Choice of your Phyſician</hi>! Will you now Chuſe GOD in CHRIST to be your Phyſician? He comes in his own Ordinance This Day, and tenders to undertake the Cure of all your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; Be they Soul-Maladies, Family-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, Political or Eccleſiaſtical Wounds and Sickneſſes, He ſaith to each ſuch Perſon, and to this Province, <hi>Wilt thou not be Healed and Cured, when ſhall it once be?</hi> As He ſaid to Jeruſalem, <hi>Wilt thou not be made Clean?
