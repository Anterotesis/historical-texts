            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHoso shall view over and attentively consider the whole trace and series of Gods dealing with, and dispensations towards his Covenant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (however as to them they have somtimes issued very dreadfully) will find them giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in clear and abundant testimony to the Truth of that of the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 8. <hi>The Lord is Gracious, and full of compassion, slow to anger, and of great mercy.</hi> Among many other passages in the sacred story to this purpose (purposely kept upon the File for the use of the Church in all Ages, and for ours upon whom the ends of the world are come) (he whose compassions have been ever of old, using the same tenor of tender dispensations towards his People now as then) the <hi>Text</hi> now read, as also what we find in the foregoing Chapters, make this very evident, and apparent. You may see in the first Chapter Gods calling, instructing, and encouraging the Prophet, as to his Office and Work, or as to his Office-work, he being one of those Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of whom you have mention made, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15. <hi>That the Lord God of their Fathers sent unto them, rising up betimes, and sending, because he had compassion on his People, and on his dwelling Place.</hi> You may see in the second Chapter Gods earnest and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate

God Rings such a peal in <hi>Jerusalems</hi> ears by the Prophet throughout the Chapter upon this account, as one would have thought, should have reached, and pierced, should have thirl'd and thaw'd their very hearts; you may see in the third Chapter, God inviting and perswading them to Repent and turn to him with Promises of gracious acceptation, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. 12.

Chapter, while yet there is any hope we have God still pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the matter with them, laying close siege unto them, putting home his threatnings, lowdly alarming them with his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, plainly warning them of the worst that was to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and unavoidably coming upon them, if not prevented solemnly, and earnestly admonishing them to bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, be advised that it might not come to that. This is in general the sense &amp; intendment of the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Context,</hi> but to take a little more particularly view of it we have here:</p>

DOCT. God so threatens to leave and lay waste, to take off his heart from, and turn his destroying hand upon his own People, as that it may, and that it may be prevented; yet so that if it be not, it will come to that: It concerns them therefore to be instructed, to be advised, to hearken to counsel, to bethink themselves, to be convinced, affected, repent, amend, convert and turn to God, lest they bring it to that woful pass.</q>
            <p>We have three things in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> (and the <hi>Text</hi> is very full of them all) 1. That God so threatens to leave and lay waste, to take off his heart from, and turn his destroying hand upon his own People, as that it may, and that it may be prevented. 2. Yet God so threatens it, that if it be not prevented, it will come to that, he will certainly leave and lay them waste; take off his heart from them, and turn his destroying hand upon them. 3. It concerns them therefore, or these things considered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> things thus standing, to be instructed, to be advised, to hearken to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, to bethink themselves, to be convinced, affected, repent, amend, convert and turn to God, lest they bring it to that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pass.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God so threatens to leave and lay waste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to take off his heart from and turn his destroying hand upon his own People:</hi> i. e. <hi>His vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Covenant People, as that it may, and that it may be prevented.</hi> The manner of God in his threatnings, is to leave room for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; his end being that (if it may be) the threatned evil may be prevented: God doth not take a silent leave of his People (<hi>Jacob</hi> like from <hi>Laban</hi>) upon displeasure, steal away from them and say nothing, get him out of hearing before they hear any thing of it: He doth not break away from them suddenly and remedy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly, nor yet break in upon them suddenly, surprise them (tho a sinful People) fall foul upon them in his wrath, cast them off, cut them off; no this is not the manner of God, whose delight is in mercy. But God threatens to leave his People, so that it may, and that it may be prevented: God never leaves his People

but he first threatens, warnes, advises, admonishes them; but he first bespeaks them as his People here; <hi>O be instructed:</hi> Our Bible so abounds with this, that it were endless and to men acquainted with Scripture, 'tis needless to give particular instances, God long and often threatned, and warned <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> of old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he alienated his heart from them; called them <hi>Loammi,</hi> and gave them a Bill of Divorce, nor yet had <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and those other New-Testament Churches (tho now God makes quicker work than then) their Candlestick's removed, but after solemn &amp; signal warning, for the prevention of it. And the reasons of it are,</p>
            <p>Reas. 1. <hi>From Gods lothness to leave his People, his own, his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant People;</hi> the tender and indeared affection that he bears un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a People taken near unto himself; Gods affections are stronger, and he stands in closer relation to his Covenant People, than that he easily cast off and forsake them: <hi>The Lord will not forsake his</hi> P<hi>eople,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22. And in very deed, their being his People is founded upon such a bottom, even that of his free Grace, that is not easily slighted, as the reason there added shews; the Lord will not forsake his People, <hi>Because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his People.</hi> God having made any his People, and that of meer good pleasure, is not forward to cast off and forsake them: God not willingly afflicts, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 33. but much more loathly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects his Covenant-people, as is notably set forth, <hi>Hos.</hi> 11. 8. <hi>How shall I give thee up</hi> Ephraim? <hi>How shall I deliver thee Israel? How shall I make thee as</hi> Adma, <hi>and set thee as</hi> Zeboim? <hi>My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</hi> The great God who here (as commonly in Scripture) speaks of himself after the manner of men, to our understanding; gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand in this strange, passionate and Rhetorical language; how hardly he brings his heart to it, to give up as to any more room in his affection, to deliver over unto destruction his own People: God (as I may say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) is at a set when it comes to this, it casts him into a deep deliberation &amp; a sorely exercising conflict in his own thoughts about it; how doth he turn it with himself, and deeply, and inwardly, revolving the matter, question with

What give up <hi>Ephraim,</hi> deliver <hi>Israel,</hi> make <hi>Ephraim,</hi> make <hi>Israel</hi> as<hi> Adma</hi> and <hi>Zeboim?</hi> how can I do it? what deal thus by thee <hi>Ephraim,</hi> by thee <hi>Israel,</hi> by thee discard, destroy my own People as I have done? <hi>Sodom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> how can I find in my heart to do it? how doth God roule this bitter pill in his mouth (with holy reverence be it spoken) and as unable to swallow it, at last spit it out? <hi>I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim;</hi> so exceeding loth is God to give up, to give over his People to destruction and therefore layes his threatning of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so, as to leave room for remedy.</p>
            <p>Reas. 2. <hi>That he might hereby try the love and affection of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether they will let him go:</hi> God intimates to a People his leaving of them, threatens with it before he doth, that he may feel how their pulse beats towards him, what affections they have for him; how their love will strive and work upon such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion before God quite leaves a People, wholly takes off his heart from them; he is willing to sound theirs whether they have any affections left for him. You may read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. (the People having committed that great sin in making them Gods of gold) God tells them he will leave them, he will go no more in the midst of them; and to make them the more sensible of it, <hi>Moses</hi> takes the Tabernacle (the visible signe and token of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence) and <hi>pitches it without the camp afar off;</hi> and now God looks and listens what they say to it, how they take it that he may accordingly deal with them: When God is about to leave his People because they provoke and set light by him, he is yet willing to try them to the utmost whether they will so part with him; whether they will indeed let him go, or whether they will stir up themselves to take hold of him. You may see in, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 10, 11. Chapters, God so signalizing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

there were any that minded or regarded.</p>
            <p>Reas. 3. <hi>That they might have opportunity of striving to keep God with them, and be quickned and stirred up to the improvement of it;</hi> that they might, as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 6. <hi>Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near.</hi> God makes offer to go from his People, threatens to be gone, speakes of leaving them that they may be effectually awakened to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what's the matter, to reform what's amiss, to repent of and part with those sins that are the causes of Gods threatned depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from them; by such intimations also, <hi>lest I leave you, lest my Soul depart from you:</hi> God would stir up his People, not to let him go, shake them up from their loose sitting to him, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them to lay faster hold on him.</p>
            <p>Reas. 4. and last; <hi>That when God hath left a People, and leaving them left them to destrection, they may be lost inexcusable;</hi> that when God is gone he hath inded cast off a People, his Soul is departed from them, his heart and hand turned against them (all means of precaution, prevention improved with them proving unavail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) they may not have to complain but of themselves, and their own wilful and remedyless self-destroying folly.

but remain unadmonishable, incorigible irreclaimable under all: God will leave and give over such a People, though his own People: See, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 31, 32, 33. <hi>verses.</hi> God tells them he will remove them from before his Face, because of all the evil which they did, and because though he taught them rising up early, and teaching them, yet they hearkened not to receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, so 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 36. 14. &amp;c. <hi>God had compassion on his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and on his dwelling Place:</hi> And hence hare with them, forbare them, continued with much patience in the use of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of means to wait upon them, but they continued to sin, and slighted all <hi>until the wrath of the Lord arose against his People, till there was no remedy.</hi> God warns in mercy, and may continue to warn in much mercy; but to sin, to continue to sin against warning, will at last bring wrath without remedy: And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it are:</p>

Psal.</hi> 106. 39, 40, 41. And what a fearful word is that from God concerning his own People, the People of his choice and love, <hi>Amos</hi> 6 8. <hi>The Lord hath sworn by himself, saith the Lord God of Hosts, I abhorr the excellency of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hate his Palaces, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Never is God so wedded unto any People but they may sin so as utterly to work themselves out of his affections.</p>

then what a corrasive it is to the heart of God to be so dealt by in that which he hath set his mind upon, never any thing more: O sirs, would you study to thwart, to cross God, to do him the greatest despight; there is no way like this, and will God bear it to have the deep counsels of his Wisdom derided, the great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the pleasure of his will opposed, the wonder of his love slighted, the riches of his grace despised, his Son the darling of his Soul contemned and rejected, yea himself in all that he is, and has, and can do for poor creatures (all his gracious and merciful overtures to them notwithstanding) utterly set at naught; <hi>will not God visit for these things?</hi> will not his Soul be disjoynted from, and avenged upon such a people as this?</p>

And too evident it is that we are much backsliden from God in our affections and conversations; we have lost our first love and left our first works; if the love of <hi>New-Englands</hi> espousals be now sought for, it will not be found, and if the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of those that first followed the Lord into this, as then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sowen Land, be enquired after how dim and almost worn out will they appear? where is that ancient love, desire, delight to and in the Ordinances of God, and all the means of Communion with him, and that careful and exact walking with God in all those wayes of duty, both towards God and Man now become? Verily, we are gone backward, backward and not foreward; and verily these backward retrograde God forsaking Motions carry such hateful unthankfulness unto God, such to be abominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falseness, perfidiousness to him; yea, they cast such reproach and contempt upon God, put such a publick slight upon him, put him to such open shame in the eye of the world, for a People after some tryal made of him and of his service, thus to decline, shrink back from and forsake him, that we have cause to fear God, will take himself in honour bound to right himself in the ruine of such a People.

Under the rain that hath come oft upon us, and all the husbandry God hath been at with us, we have not brought forth fruit meet for him, by whom we have been dressed, and what measure we have meated, it hath been measured to us again: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der much means, and a promising, flourishing profession, little real fruit hath been brought forth to God; and how like to this have we found in that little good grain under goodly appearances, and a great burden that the earth hath brought forth to us? and doth not the hand of God upon this account grow very awful towards u<hi>s?</hi> is not the meat cut off before our eyes? do we not see mens crops fail them (at least in many places) year after year, and every year more than other? should God go on to do by us a few years more as he hath done for some years past, it would look apace towards cleanness of teeth. And hath not God cut us short of our credit and estimation? brought us low upon that account also: <hi>New-Englands</hi> name hath been much set by, much more than now <hi>New-Englands</hi> credit and repute is brought many pegs lower than sometime<hi>s;</hi> when we were precious in Gods sight, we were honourable; but when he makes no such account of a People, they soon grow out of credit; God hath made us to know the truth of that, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30.

virtually and eminently contained in it, founded upon, and flowing from it; but to be rejected of God, cast out of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, it is in it self the forest judgment; it hath in it all that evil is, and it is the sourse of all that doth, or may, or can fall out sadly or unhappily to us: if we have Gods heart we cannot want his hand; if he be with us, if he be for us, who or what shall be against us? if he cause his Face to shine upon us, we shall be saved; but if he take off his heart, forsake, hide his Face from us, we shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles will befall us, all kind of calamities will cloud in; mischiefs will be heaped upon us if God take his presence (and consequently his peace) from us, even loving-kindness and mercie<hi>s:</hi> what will follow but that he will vex us with all adversity; our wise-men will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated, our men of courage and activity dispirited, our peaceable and guidable men froward and headlong, nothing will prosper with us, but all things will conspire and work together ruine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; counsel, strength, protection, sustenance, all will fail us; Sword, Sickness, Famine, evils of all sorts grow in upon, pursue and cleave unto us till they have consumed us.</p>

And think also what an act of grace it is that God will thus accept of, and re-entertain repenting and returning sinners; it is a great act of grace for God to take any to be his People; but it is a much greater to fall in again with those that have deeply revolted from him: O methinks such peerless, unpattern'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrallel'd mercy, as such it is proposed in the third Chapter of this prophesie, <hi>vers.</hi> 1. should melt, overcome, win upon the hearts of poor sinners; <hi>though we have plaid the harlot with many lovers will God yet receive us.</hi> O will he methinks, as persons overcome of mercy, our very souls, should say, behold we come unto thee; for thou art the Lord our God.</p>
