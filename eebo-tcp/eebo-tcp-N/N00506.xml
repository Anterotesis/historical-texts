         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the morning Major <hi>Schuyler</hi> resolved to march over the River, to pursue the Enemy, ordering the Officers to get the men ready for that purpose, but many of the men being wearied with fatigue, their Shoes being quite wore out, and Provisions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

            <p>In this Engagement we lost four private Souldiers, &amp; four Indians, two Officers and twelve Christians, and Indians wounded; and we had an account by some of our Indian Prisoners that made their escape, that we killed of the Enemy 33<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof we found but 27, among which was their Commandant, one Captain, and two others Officers, with two of their commanding Indians, and 26 wounded. We rescued between forty and fifty Prisoners.</p>
            <p>Since their Retreat we are informed by divers of the Prisoners, who come home daily, that all our men Prisoners except five, have made their escape, or are set at liberty, and but few Women and Children left with them, not being able to carry the Prisoners off, by reason of their wounded men, whereof they carry thirteen.</p>

            <p>That there is a Fort built below <hi>Quebeck,</hi> in a narrow Passage where Ships must pass; the <hi>French</hi> spoke of two Forts (but an <hi>English man</hi> told him only of one Fort) and twelve Guns in each Fort.

            <p>The Inhabitants seem to be much wearied of the War, and cry much for Peace, and pray that God would turn the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s heart, and incline him to make Peace, for it is his fault that all these Miseries are come upon them.</p>
            <p>There is a man come over with those Ships to be Mons. <hi>d' Cellier</hi>'s Cock, who says, that the <hi>English</hi> had fallen upon the <hi>French</hi> Fleet unawares, and done them some damage, and pursued them to <hi>Brest,</hi> and if they had come but a quarter of an hour sooner, they had taken <hi>Brest,</hi> and all the Province of <hi>Brittanine</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> have lost this Summer 37 <hi>French</hi> and 70 <hi>Indians</hi> at one time, going up the Falls to <hi>Ottawawa,</hi> and at a second time they lost 30 <hi>French</hi> the same way, and often times smaller Parties killed by our <hi>Indians.</hi>

After they had been about a moneth or five weeks together in said <hi>M. d' Celliers</hi> house, the said <hi>Andries</hi> says, he saw a great prodigious Quantity of Beavers at <hi>Ottawawa</hi>; an Inhabitant of <hi>Canada,</hi> called <hi>Jaques de Tallie,</hi> told him, he had 3000 Beaver of his own there, and that there was as many Beavers now in <hi>Ottawawa</hi> as would load 200 Canows to <hi>Canada,</hi> and each Canow generally holds nine or ten hundred Beavers; which the said <hi>Andries</hi> doth credibly believe to be true, there being none gone from thence to <hi>Canada</hi> in a great while.</p>

            <p>IT is not unknown to some of you, that I came last <hi>October</hi> into these parts upon no other occasion than to view the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>onteers, and put them in the best posture I could, to secure us and you, from the Attempts of the <hi>French</hi> and their <hi>Indian</hi> our Enemies and yours. And in order to this I sent a supply of Amunition, Arti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary, and Christian Souldiers, sufficient to prevent any Insult from our Enemies, and it had the effect I expected, for they durst not face the weakest of our Garrisons. I came now for your Relief, and have lost no time; the same day that I had an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count from hence that our Enemies were in this Country, I put my self on board a Sloop, and brought with me 150 Christian Souldiers, besides Volunteers, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved here before I could be expected; I then immediately marched to <hi>Schen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I had also 200 Christians more upon their march, who arrived here, and would have been a considerable Reinforcement to us, but the Action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, I commanded them back to their former Residence, till further Orders. It is obvious to me, and I believe to you all, that this Calamity is fallen on you by your own faults. I could never suppose my Brethren, the <hi>Mohaques,</hi> would be so supine and careless, as to suffer the <hi>French,</hi> and their Indians to enter their Castles without the least Resistance. These men that have an Enemy near, must sleep with Arms in their Hands, and one eye open, that is, they must keep Scouts and Spyes, so as never to become a prey to their Enemies, by their own negligence. I must advise you, that for the future, you keep strict watch, so that I may have timely notice of the Enemy's motion, and you will then see how easily they will be defeated.</p>
            <p>I hope it is now apparent to you, that the great of King of <hi>England</hi> is ready to apply his Arms for your defence, when you consider, that in a very few days I am come personally to your Assistance, with near 400 Christian Souldiers. I have had the Honour to bear Command under the great <hi>King of England,</hi> my Master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where I have seen the <hi>French</hi> fly before his victorious Arms; and last Summer it pleased God to add to his Victories, by the defeat and destruction of their Fleet, in which most of their Ships were burnt or sunk.</p>
            <p>I came now in great haste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and brought no Presents with me, but design (by the blessing of God) to be with you at the beginning of Summer, to give you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to wipe off your Tears for the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We pray that you would be pleased to acquaint our great Lord of Lords<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who lives over the great great Lake, of our mean Condition, and what p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ture we are in, and how easy it is to destroy <hi>Canada,</hi> if all our great Lord of Lords subjects in these Collonies would unite and joyn together, with some Ships that carry great Guns, which our great Lord of Lords can easily spare us, after this late Victory over the <hi>French</hi> at Sea.</p>
            <p>We desire that you would be pleased to order a Smith to be with us in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to repair our Arms, that we may defend us from the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Excellency replyed, That he hoped they were sufficiently satisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Governour granted their Request of the Smith to be in their Country to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their Arms.</p>

            <p>WE are come to acquaint you, that one of our men has last night in a drunken fit, killed an <hi>Indian</hi> that came over from the <hi>French,</hi> at which we are much concerned, and therefore come to see how our <hi>Brother great swift Arrow</hi> resents it.</p>
            <p>We desire that you would be pleased to prohibit the selling of Rum while the War is so hot, since our Souldiers cannot be kept within Bounds, if they be drunk.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brother great swift Arrow,</hi> We answered your Excellency's Proposals yesterday, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

We are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for your kind expressions, to be so ready to come for our Relief, and that you warn us to come and acquaint you as soon as we see the Enemy a coming a far off, not doubting of your Power to protect us, since we have seen a sufficient proof of that already by this late Expedition.</p>

            <p>We desire that you, <hi>Brother great swift Arrow,</hi> may come up as soon as the Bark is loose upon the Trees, since we have a design upon the Enemy.</p>
            <p>We forgot to answer you in that business about the Young men killing the Horses, we acknowledge, its not Brotherly, but very ill done, and as soon as we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>His Excellency replyed, that he was much concerned that they should exercise their Arms one against another, while there is an Enemy in the Field, and hopes they will for the future endeavour to prevent such Irregularities: That they may be now sufficiently convinced how ready the Arms of the great King of <hi>England</hi> is to succour them; &amp; that his Excellency, for his own part will never spare to expose his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
