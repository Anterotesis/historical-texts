            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Inhabitants of the Province of the <hi>Massatusets-Bay,</hi> by a false Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, obtain'd a <hi>Grant</hi> of the said Land from their late Majesties <hi>King William</hi> and <hi>Queen Mary</hi> in the Year 1691, with a Reservation, that the Government of the <hi>Massatusets</hi> should pass no <hi>Grants</hi> of any of the said Lands without the Approbation of the <hi>Crown</hi>; After which, the <hi>Massatusets</hi> would not be at the Expence of Protecting and Defending the same, but in the Year 1696, gave it up to the <hi>French King,</hi> to whom it remained 'till the Year 1710, that General <hi>Nicholson</hi> with her late Majesties Arms Reconquer'd the same; which was confirm'd to the Crown of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> But neither the <hi>Massatusets</hi> nor the <hi>French,</hi> settled any Inhabitants thereon since the Revolution.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Lords Commissioners</hi> for <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Plantations,</hi> in the Year 1716, when the said Petitioners was by His <hi>Majesty</hi> referr'd to that Board, did propose that the Petitioners should provide Trustees to the Crown, for settling the said Land, which the said Petitioners then perform'd to their <hi>Lordships</hi> great Satisfaction with <hi>Persons</hi> of great <hi>Worth,</hi> that were willing for the general <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> to undertake the <hi>Trust</hi>: But, the <hi>Claims</hi> against the <hi>Crowns Right</hi> coming then to be laid before their <hi>Lordships</hi> by the <hi>Agent</hi> for the <hi>Province</hi> of the <hi>Massatusets-Bay,</hi> in behalf of the said <hi>Province,</hi> and several others, which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               <pb facs="unknown:002261_0002_0FDAE0D50458E270"/>
a Report was made to His <hi>Majesty,</hi> that the said Land did not belong to the <hi>Crown:</hi> The said <hi>Lords Commissioners,</hi> did notwithstanding, at the same time Report to His <hi>Majesty</hi> in favour of the <hi>Petitioners,</hi> for a Settlement for them and their Families, upon His <hi>Majesties</hi> Conquered Lands Adjacent thereunto, which Report was made the 21st of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1718.</p>
            <p>That His <hi>Majesty</hi> the same Day the said Report was Read in <hi>Council,</hi> was Graciously pleased to Refer the Matter to the <hi>Right Honourable</hi> the <hi>Lords of the Committee of His Majesties Most Honourable Privy-Council,</hi> before whom the said Petitioners (it's humbly hoped) have now made out <hi>the Right of the Crown to the said Land that they first Petitioned for a Settlement on</hi>; which they have perform'd by great length of Time, Labour, and Expence, against a <hi>Powerful Opposition:</hi> And having spent the Prime of their Years in the <hi>Service of the Crown,</hi> and was several of them at the <hi>Re-conquering the said Land,</hi> and then had <hi>Her late Majesties Most Gracious Promise,</hi> that they should have the Preference of all GRANTS of Lands there, which Promise <hi>Her Majesty</hi> again Repeated to the Petitioners since the Conclusion of the Peace.</p>
            <p>And having according to the said Proposal made by the Lords Commissioners for Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> prepared Trustees of great Worth, Noblemen, Gentlemen, Merchants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are willing to undertake the Trust of settling the said Land, and carry on Trade and Merchandize on the same Conditions to the Crown, that the Petitioners have proposed in their humble Petition to His <hi>Majesty</hi> the 21st of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1718. (jointly with the Petitioners) <hi>viz.</hi> That the Property of the Soyl and the Government shall remain to the Crown, and all Trade be free for all His <hi>Maiesties</hi> Subjects (by which Scheme) what By People that may adventure thither and settle at their own Expence, and what By Families that the Trustees may have Power to transport and settle, that are not of Ability to transport and settle themselves. The Province may be speedily peopled in such a Powerful Manner, that may not only put it out of the Power of <hi>France</hi> ever to recover or disturb the same; but in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility may render it capable to reduce <hi>Canada</hi> in a future War with <hi>France,</hi> and may in a little time become the most useful Province in <hi>America:</hi> The Soyl and Climate thereof being fit for Raising Hemp and Flax, which is design'd to be the Staple Commodity of the Province as Tobacco is in <hi>Virginia</hi>; and all other Sorts of Naval Stores may be Raised and had there in great Abundance, which may be brought to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in Exchange of our own Manufactures, and considerably increase the Consumption of every Branch thereof. It will joyn His <hi>Majesties</hi> Empire there as it were with a Chain. And from the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of its Scituation for Navigation and Trade, may (if the Settlement be incouraged) become an extraordinary Nursery for Seamen, and produce a great Addition of Strength to the Crown both by Sea and Land.</p>
            <p>The Premises Considered,</p>
            <p>The Petitioners therefore Humbly <hi>Prays,</hi> That it may please your <hi>LORDSHIP</hi> to <hi>Move,</hi> that <hi>His MAJESTY</hi> may be Graciously Pleased to <hi>GRANT,</hi> That the said Lands and Islands may be Erected into a <hi>Province, &amp;c.</hi> by the Name of GEORGIA or otherwise, as His <hi>MAJESTY</hi> shall think fit: And that the Property of the Soyl, and the Government Remain in the <hi>CROWN;</hi> That the Petitioners and others may Transport themselves and Settle there at their own Expence. And that they who may be the <hi>Trustees,</hi> may be Impower'd to Transport and Settle People there: And that such Privileges may be <hi>Granted</hi> to the Inhabitants of the said <hi>Province,</hi> to Encourage the speedy Peopling and effectual Settling thereof, during the Interval of <hi>Peace,</hi> As His <hi>MAJESTY</hi> in His Great Wisdom shall think fit.</p>
