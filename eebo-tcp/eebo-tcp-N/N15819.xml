            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO enjoy ſafety and happineſs is the deſire of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the great ſhakings now among them, will undoubtedly introduce this unſpeakable enjoyment, under the Government of <hi>THE LORD OUR RIGHT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EOUSNESS. Jer. xxiii. 5, 6.</hi> This he could not be, if he had not ſuffered the full penalty of the law of God for his people. Therefore when it is openly denied that he did any ſuch thing, we are loudly called upon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend earneſtly for the faith once delivered unto the ſaints. How far this duty is attended to, in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the Reader will judge.</p>

            <head>THE ATONEMENT of CHRIST, EXPLAINED and VINDICATED.</head>
            <p>EVIDENCE of the infinite wiſdom, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and power of God, has appeared in all his works from the beginning; but none of the children of Adam were ever willing to glorify him as God, until they were renewed by his grace. And where his grace hath been clearly revealed, they have always diſcovered a diſpoſition to neglect it, and to abuſe its precious privileges. His law is holy, juſt and good; and his goſpel reveals the way wherein it is magnified and made honorable in the ſalvation of ſinners, even the chief of them. This ſalvation is from ſin, as well as from miſery; and the nature of ſin is worſhipping and ſerving the creature more than the Creator, or loving of pleaſures more than God. Therefore the goſpel, the beſt of news, hath ever been offenſive to mankind while in their natural blindneſs. Yea, this blindneſs cannot be plainly ſpoken of, without danger of an angry inquiry, <hi>Are we blind alſo?</hi> Yet none of them would think it equal, in their temporal affairs, to have <hi>intereſted</hi> men ſet up as their judges, however capable they were to diſcern what was right, in caſes wherein they were not biaſſed. Felix found a vaſt difference, betwixt hearing of the faith in Chriſt as a curioſity, and his being arreſted thereby as a criminal before God. Acts xxiv. 24, 25. When freemen have fairly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all their <hi>debts,</hi> they ever claim a right to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020214_0004_0FAE4715284B8570"/>
               <hi>gifts</hi> on whom they pleaſe; and gifts cannot be beſtowed with honor upon any who claim them as debts. Neither can debts be forgiven by a credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, nor crimes by authority, while the debtor or the criminal denies the juſtice of the charge or ſentence againſt him, without giving up the nature of all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the end of which, is the ſafety and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the faithful, relief to the poor and needy, and infliction of juſt puniſhment upon the wicked. And the infliction of ſuch puniſhment is as much a debt to the univerſe, as any thing can be a debt to individuals; <hi>For the wages of ſin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And every child of Adam is a <hi>ſervant of ſin,</hi> until he obeys <hi>this form of doctrine from the heart.</hi> Rom. vi. 16—23.</p>
            <p>But men have wracked their inventions, from age to age, to avoid this heart obedience, and yet to graſp the honors and profits of religion to themſelves. And they have now gone ſo far in this way, as openly to ſet up their reaſon above revelation, and their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings above reaſon. Our Lord ſays to all, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs daily, and follow me; for whoſoever will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it; but whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, the ſame ſhall ſave it.</hi> Luke ix. 23, 24. But a noted miniſter in Boſton lately ſaid, "<hi>Self-determination</hi> in us men, is the only baſis of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation. To go about to prove this, by a long train of reaſoning, would be very like holding a candle to the ſun, in its meridian luſtre, for light that we might be able to ſee. It is a firſt, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle in morals, and to be evidenced, not by arguing, but by an appeal to common ſenſe; or, in other words, to the perceptions of mankind univerſally. We <hi>feel</hi> the exiſtence, and operation
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020214_0005_0FAE4715E2BE2658"/>of this power every day we live." And if it is not ſo, he ſays, "Religion, whether natural or revealed, is a ſenſeleſs pretence, ſuited only to ſerve the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of politicians and prieſts."<note n="*" place="bottom">Chauncy on God's benevolence, 1784, p. 128, 130, 137.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he ſet up reaſon above revelation, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings above reaſon; for ſelf-determination is ſo far from being the only baſis of moral obligation, that all are <hi>rebellious children, who take counſel, but not of God, and that cover with a covering, but not of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Iſai. xxx. 1, 9. From ſuch counſel, multitudes are now carried away with the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation. Others oppoſe that doctrine, who yet act upon the principle from whence it came; as we may ſee in a book publiſhed laſt year, by Mr. John Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mele, of Newport in New-Hampſhire, to prove that atonement conſiſted wholly in the excellency of Chriſt's teaching and example, in his life and death, and not at all in his ſuffering the penalty of the law for ſinners. This book was ſent to me from thence, with a requeſt of my remarks upon this moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſubject. His arguments are as follow.</p>
            <p n="1">"1. Nothing could merit favour for ſinners, which was not in itſelf agreeable to the divine mind. Chriſt is ſometimes repreſented in ſcripture as paying a price, by which he purchaſed his people. Acts xx. 28. 1 Cor. vi. 20. 2 Pet. ii. 1. Whatever that <hi>price</hi> was, it is ſelf-evidently true, that it was ſimply in itſelf pleaſing to God; therefore the ſufferings, the miſery, which he endured, could not be the price.—<hi>I have no pleaſure in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Ezek. xviii. 23, 32. If God can have no pleaſure in the miſery and juſt ſufferings of a ſinful diſobedient creature, <hi>reaſon</hi> forbids the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that he ſhould have any pleaſure in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his dutiful well-beloved Son." P. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:020214_0006_0FAE471723D13C38"/>
Anſwer, He can have no pleaſure in the ruin and miſery of any creature, ſimply conſidered; but all the puniſhments that ever came upon fallen angels, or fallen men, were for iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin; and if Chriſt did not ſuffer for the ſins of men, juſtice could not have been honored by his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor in ſaving any ſinner from hell. For <hi>by the deeds of the law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight.—God hath ſet forth Jeſus Chriſt to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God—that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him who believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Rom. iii. 20—26. We are warned againſt glorying in the wiſdom, might or riches of men; becauſe <hi>in the Lord ſhall all the ſeed of Iſrael be juſtified, and ſhall glory.</hi> Jer. ix. 23, 24. Iſaiah xlv. 22—25. From whence the apoſtle proved, that the preaching of <hi>Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,</hi> was unto the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs; but unto them who were called, both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God. 1 Cor. i. 23—31. And alſo that we ſhould ever keep to the <hi>line of things made ready to our hand,</hi> and not have our <hi>minds cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent beguiled Eve.</hi> The word <hi>line</hi> in this text, hath been applied to the lines which men have drawn around dioceſes and pariſhes, by teachers who have <hi>meaſured themſelves by themſelves.</hi> 2 Cor. x. 12—17. xi. 3. And they have been ſo much beguiled by the adverſary, as to claim all the power for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and earthly rulers, that Abraham, Moſes, Aaron and David ever had, over the bodies and ſouls of men. Yea, much more; for the whole of their power, was to command their children and their houſehold after them, <hi>to keep the way of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020214_0007_0FAE4717ABCEE3B8"/>Lord, to do juſtice and judgment.</hi> Gen. xviii. 19. But the old dragon hath ever been at war with the ſeed of the true church, who <hi>keep the commandments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> wherein the merits of his <hi>blood</hi> is the firſt article. Rev. xii. 11, 17. He is eſtabliſhed as our prophet, prieſt and king, by the <hi>oath of God,</hi> in an <hi>order</hi> above Abraham, Moſes, Aaron or David. Rom. xiv. 10—12. Heb. iii. 3. vii. 4—22. And the goſpel ſays, <hi>Looſe thyſelf from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion; for thus ſaith the Lord, Ye have ſold yourſelves for nought; and ye ſhall be redeemed without money.—Thy God reigneth.—He made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, becauſe he had done no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, neither was any deceit in his mouth; yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he hath put him to grief; when thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his days, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied: by his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtify many; for he ſhall bear their iniquities.</hi> And to believe this <hi>report</hi> with the <hi>heart,</hi> and to confeſs it with the <hi>mouth,</hi> is the only way of <hi>ſalvation.</hi> Iſai. lii. 3, 7. liii. 1, 9—11. Rom. x. 4, 10, 15, 16. He ſaid, <hi>They who hate me without a cauſe, are more than the hairs of mine head, then I reſtored that which I took not away.</hi> Pſal. lxix. 4. John xv. 25. Yet it is now ſaid,</p>
            <p n="2">"2. If Chriſt appeared in the place of ſinners, to ward off the ſtroke of vengeance, by giving it an opportunity to alight on him—the conſequence is unavoidable, that he in a <hi>very ſhort ſeaſon</hi> endured the ſame quantity of miſery which would have born ſinners down to eternity. A thought which exceeds all rules of computation, and departs from all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of juſt reaſoning." P. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:020214_0008_0FAE471825284C70"/>
Anſwer, Here is the root of all the evils in the world. Angels and men have erred, becauſe their knowledge was limited; and the only certain ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt all error, is obedience to the revealed will of the <hi>Father of lights, with whom is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning.</hi> It is the only <hi>perfect law of liberty.</hi> James i. 16—25. Before our glorious <hi>Shepherd, all nations are as nothing, and they are counted to him leſs than nothing, and vanity.</hi> And he ſays, <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep;</hi> a choſen number, and not for all mankind. Iſaiah xi. 10, 11, 17. John x. 15, 26—29. And when he was going to do it, he ſaid, <hi>If they do theſe things in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?</hi> Luke xxiii. 31. Nothing is more unreaſonable, than for us to imagine, that finite can comprehend infinite, or that debtors and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals are adequate judges of their own cauſes. Yet it is now ſaid,</p>
            <p n="3">"3. Thoſe animals made uſe of in ancient rites are never ſaid to make atonement, but this is often acknowledged of the prieſts who were active in the matter. Therefore, ſo far as ſufferings were inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Chriſt, and ſo far as atonement conſiſts in <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> he can only be conſidered as the <hi>medium</hi> by which atonement was made, and not the perſon who made it. What Chriſt <hi>did,</hi> and not what was done to him, was the matter of atonement." P. 22, 23.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, Thoſe animals were innocent, while the prieſts who offered them were guilty; and were daily to offer, firſt for their own ſins, and then for the ſins of the people; therefore <hi>Jeſus was Surety of a better teſtament. For if the blood of bulls, and of goats, and the aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh, how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020214_0009_0FAE4718E61B4790"/>dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi> This is the only way for any ſoul to <hi>draw nigh unto God.</hi> Heb. vii. 17—27. ix. 13, 14. This is <hi>the Rock</hi> of which David propheſied. Pſalm xl. 2—10. Heb. x. 5—14. This is <hi>the Stone which the builders refuſed.</hi> Pſalm cxviii. 19—23. Mat. xxi. 42. And how many do ſo in our day! If the ſins of the elect were not <hi>imputed</hi> to Chriſt as their <hi>Surety,</hi> he never could have made any atonement for them, nor they be ſaved by him; yet our author ſays, "Some have ſecured themſelves under the vapory idea that Chriſt was by <hi>imputation</hi> ſinful, and ſuſtaining this imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſinful character, he was the object of divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure." P. 24. But he ought to know, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do not hold that Chriſt was ever made a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon; or that the Father was ever angry with him; but that he <hi>made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> 2 Cor. v. 21. When Aaron and his ſons put their hands upon the head of the bullock, and it was killed before the Lord, and its inwards were burnt upon the altar, and its body without the camp, for a <hi>ſin-offering,</hi> the bullock was not made a <hi>ſinner</hi> thereby; neither was Jeſus, when he <hi>ſuffered without the gate.</hi> Exod. xxix. 10—14. Heb. xiii. 11, 12. And though Aaron was to lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and to confeſs over him all the iniquities of the children of Iſrael, and all their tranſgreſſions in all their ſins, putting them upon the head of the goat, which was to bear upon him all their iniquities, unto a land not inhabited, the goat was not made a ſinner thereby, any more than Chriſt was, when <hi>the Lord laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of us all.</hi> Levi. xvi. 21, 22. Iſaiah liii. 6. And we are ſolemnly warned againſt <hi>laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020214_0010_0FAE4719C83739C8"/>towards God, of the doctrine of baptiſms, and of laying on of hands, and of reſurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</hi> How terrible will be the caſe of thoſe who <hi>fall away from this foundation!</hi> The word <hi>baptiſms</hi> in this text, is the ſame Greek word that is tranſlated <hi>waſhings</hi> in another chapter, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>Without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion.</hi> Heb. vi. 1—6. ix. 10, 22. Life was forfeited by ſin, and could only be recovered by blood, the life of the fleſh; for which reaſon Iſrael were never to eat blood; and ſays God, <hi>I have given it to you upon the altar, to make atonement for your ſouls.</hi> Levi. iii. 17. xvii. 11. Abel was accepted in this way; and all that dwell upon the earth worſhip the beaſt, whoſe names are not written in the book of life of the <hi>Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</hi> Rev. xiii. 8. Their cry hath been, <hi>Who is like unto the beaſt? Who is able to make war with him?</hi> His number is the number of a <hi>man.</hi> Rev. xiii. 4, 8, 18. Nothing muſt be allowed of in religion, but what can be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſupported by <hi>man.</hi> Our author ſays,</p>
            <p n="4">"4. That in all God's works one object is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to as his great and laſt end.—The feelings of God towards himſelf are fully expreſſed in ſcripture. <hi>I wrought for my name's ſake. Not for your ſakes do I this, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Ezek. xx. 9. xxxvi. 32. He had himſelf in view as his chief object, when he cauſed creation to riſe into exiſtence, and the ſame he will purſue to the grand concluſion of all things. Thus he makes himſelf the beginning and end.—<hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the</hi> GLORY OF GOD IN THE FACE OF JESUS CHRIST. 2 Cor. iv. 6." P. 25. 26.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, It is indeed ſo; but the <hi>god of this world blinds the minds of unbelievers,</hi> leſt this glory ſhould
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020214_0011_0FAE471A613EAA78"/>ſhine unto them, as the apoſtle had juſt before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. For God to be manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of angels, preached unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory, is the great <hi>myſtery of godlineſs;</hi> whereon the church is built as the <hi>pillar and ground of the truth.</hi> But ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſpirits, and doctrines of devils have long ſince fixed an oppoſite notion of godlineſs in the minds of multitudes, even a ſuppoſal that <hi>gain is godlineſs.</hi> 1 Tim. iii. 15, 16. iv. 1. vi. 5, Satan declared that the penalty of the law was not <hi>true;</hi> but Chriſt bare witneſs unto the <hi>truth, and deſtroyed the power of the devil, through death.</hi> John xviii. 37. Heb. ii. 14, 15. And thoſe who believe the contrary, are left to ſtrong deluſion to believe a lie. 2 Theſſ. ii. 3—12. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraining from the forbidden fruit, was the <hi>pledge</hi> of Adam's allegiance to God, as the great proprietor and governor of the world; and by eating of it he became a <hi>robber</hi> and a <hi>rebel;</hi> and we are all born in this ſtate of revolt, as the beſt of men have confeſſed. Pſalm li. 5. Eph. ii. 3. And God will be juſtified in his <hi>ſayings,</hi> and will overcome when <hi>he is judged.</hi> Rom. iii. 4, 9—19. Men have arraigned his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at their bar. He ſays, <hi>If the wicked reſtore the pledge, give again that he had robbed, walk in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of life, without committing iniquity, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die.</hi> But the ways of men have been ſo <hi>unequal,</hi> as with their <hi>mouth</hi> to ſhew much love, while their <hi>heart</hi> went after their <hi>covetouſneſs.</hi> They have ruled God's people with <hi>force and cruelty,</hi> and have uſed every art to prevent their having any <hi>good paſture, or clear water.</hi> But he who is the <hi>root and offspring of David,</hi> will cauſe theſe <hi>evil beaſts to ceaſe out of the land;</hi> and he ſays, <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</hi> A righteous father cannot ſave a wicked child, nor a wicked father hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020214_0012_0FAE471D565DD868"/>the ſalvation of his child that repents; neither can any child of Adam be ſaved without a <hi>perfect righteouſneſs,</hi> and perſeverance therein. Ezek. xiv. 20. xviii. 20. xxxiii. 10—15, 31. xxxiv. 4, 17—25. Rev. xxii. 16, 17. And the violation of theſe plain truths, is the cauſe of all the blood, ſlavery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in the world. The goſpel proclaims <hi>abundance of grace, and the gift of righteouſneſs,</hi> as freely as ever water flowed. Rom. v. 17. But men have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented another language; and it is now ſaid,</p>
            <p n="5">"5. The plan of reconciliation left mankind in ſuch a condition, as that they might be the objects of the juſt diſpleaſure of God.—If it be only granted, that men have univerſally rejected the <hi>offers</hi> of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are criminal for ſuch rejection, there can be no reaſonable objections againſt God's juſtice, if all men ſhould be excluded from that ſalvation." It is alſo ſaid, "The goſpel-offers ſhould be <hi>as lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited</hi> as the premiſes from which they grow: for if the offers are more extenſive than the proviſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, there is an appearance <hi>at leaſt</hi> of ſomething little better than deception." P. 22, 27.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, It is moſt certain, that the juſtice of God will ever ſhine clear in the condemnation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, even in countries where they have not the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word. Rom. i. 18—21. And much more where they have it; but goſpel-offers, is the language of deceitful men, and not of the word of God; who ſent his Son to <hi>preach good tidings unto the meek, to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that mourn.</hi> And when he made this proclamation, many wondered at his <hi>gracious words,</hi> until he let them know, that he had a good right to ſave whom he
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020214_0013_0FAE471D61A8F568"/>pleaſed, even among the Sidonians or Syrians, and to leave many in Iſrael to periſh in their ſins; and then they were <hi>filled with wrath.</hi> Iſaiah lxi. 1, 2. Luke iv. 17—29. And natural men diſcover the ſame diſpoſition to this day. God never proclaimed atonement for <hi>preſumptuous</hi> ſinners; but ſuch were to die without mercy, by the ſentence of the prieſt and judge in Iſrael; and of how much ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath <hi>trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of grace!</hi> Num. xv. 30, 31. Deut. xvii. 1—12. Heb. x. 26—29. His perſon never could be trodden under foot by any; but his laws and authority are ſo, to an amazing degree; and his <hi>blood,</hi> which <hi>purgeth believers from all ſin,</hi> (1 John i. 7.) is now made uſe of to harden multitudes in iniquity, who would not dare to act as they do, if he had not died for ſinners; and he only knows how many have done deſpite to the Spirit of grace. His grace hath appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodlineſs, and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world, looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Titus ii. 11—14. His proclamation of <hi>grace</hi> ever contained fixed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and a limited time. He ſays, <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of ſalvation.</hi> And they who hold the contrary are <hi>unbelievers and idolators,</hi> with whom we ought not to be <hi>yoked.</hi> 2 Cor. vi. 1, 2, 14—18. The Son of God is infinitely above Moſes; and the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> Heb. iii. 1—9. Yet theſe hearts are now appealed to, as our rule; and it is ſaid, "Let no one be alarmed,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020214_0014_0FAE471E81D4B448"/>if we poſitively deny, that he ſuffered any of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath which ſinners juſtly deſerve; for there can no ſuch contradictory idea exiſt, that a being ſhould be <hi>angry</hi> with an object with which he is at the ſame time <hi>well pleaſed."</hi> P. 33.</p>
            <p>Here our ſinful paſſions are ſet up againſt the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal truth of God, who aſſures us, that he who ſpareth his rod <hi>hateth</hi> his ſon; but he that <hi>loveth</hi> him, chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth him betimes. Prov. xiii. 24. Hence hatred and love are directly oppoſite to the carnal feelings of parents and children; and the conduct of the <hi>Son of God</hi> under ſufferings, ought to raiſe all our ſouls above the folly of <hi>babes.</hi> Prov. iii. 11, 12. Heb. v. 8—14. xii. 5—10. And to deny that God can do more than men, is infinitely worſe than babes. Men readily admit of ſureties for debt, and for the faithful diſcharge of promiſes and covenants; and when a ſurety freely and fairly enters into bonds in ſuch caſes, juſtice as clearly exacts the bonds of the ſurety, as of the firſt contractor. Neither can juſtice be done to debtor or ſurety, if the judge is <hi>angry</hi> with them, or hath any <hi>perſon in admiration becauſe of advantage.</hi> Men cannot juſtly admit of a ſurety in capital caſes, becauſe they cannot raiſe the dead, nor change the heart of the living; but God can do both, and the whole plan of revelation, and of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, is built upon this truth. Hence he ſaid to the diſputers of that day, <hi>Ye do err, not knowing the ſcriptures, nor the power of God.</hi> Mat. xxii. 29. And this error was ſo deeply rooted in the minds of his diſciples, that one of them plainly ſays, <hi>As yet they knew not the ſcripture, that he muſt riſe again from the dead.</hi> John xx. 9. And this point was diſputed in the church of Corinth, which made the apoſtle ſay, <hi>If Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your ſins.</hi> But he boldly ſays, <hi>Now is Chriſt riſen
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020214_0015_0FAE471FB8CCDCF0"/>from the dead, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept. For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead: for as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> And the belief of this is openly declared by every perſon who is rightly <hi>baptized.</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 20—23, 29.</p>
            <p>As by union with Adam, our natural head, we all die, ſo all believers will hereafter be raiſed by their union with Chriſt, their ſpiritual head. It is by <hi>his voice</hi> that any ſoul is now raiſed to ſpiritual life; and by <hi>his voice</hi> all will hereafter be raiſed from their <hi>graves; they that have done good, unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of damnation.</hi> And ſays he, <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. I receive not honor from men; but I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</hi> John v. 25, 28, 29, 40—42. Yet theſe hearts, which have not the love of God in them, are now ſet up as our rule, inſtead of his revealed will. And our author ſays, "Let what ſcheme of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be invented that may, the whole weight of the arguments muſt depend on one of three general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, either that atonement was made for only a part of mankind, while the other part are excluded even from a poſſibility of ſalvation by the plan; or, for all mankind, in ſuch a ſenſe, that none can be loſt and the divine deſign be accompliſhed; or for all mankind, in the ſenſe of a general principle upon which reconciliation may take place, and even mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions loſt, and the deſign be completely executed." P. 38.</p>
            <p>Here all may ſee that the whole weight of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments turns upon <hi>invented</hi> ſchemes, and not upon what God has revealed. And we may diſcover the following errors in his inventions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A want of diſtinguiſhing betwixt ſin, the only
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020214_0016_0FAE4720703CA200"/>object of God's anger, and the perſon who bears it. Of the beſt of his ſaints it was truly ſaid, <hi>Thou waſt a God that forgaveſt them, though thou tookeſt venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their inventions.</hi> Pſalm xcix. 8. He <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned</hi> many in the wilderneſs, whoſe carcaſes he doomed to fall therein, for their unbelief. Yea, Aaron and Moſes muſt openly know his diſpleaſure, <hi>becauſe they ſanctified him not in the midſt of the children of Iſrael.</hi> Num. xiv. 11, 20, 21. Deut. xxxii. 51. David's ſin of adultery and murder were put away; and yet God requited him with the ſame evils in his family. One ſon defiled his daughter; another murdered him; and then drove his father from the throne, and lay with his wives in the ſight of the ſun. 2 Sam. xii. 7—14. xiii. 14, 29. xvi. 22. And though Solomon built the temple, and was greatly owned by God therein; yet ten tribes were rent away from his ſon, for his ſin of ſitting up the high places. And though immediate war betwixt the two kingdoms was prevented, yet it broke out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and half a million were ſlain in one day; the greateſt ſlaughter that ever happened among mankind in any one day, ſince Adam fell. 2 Chron. xiii. 17, 18. How great then is God's anger againſt ſin, even in his own people!</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our author appears to be ſtrangely blinded, by the practice of taking the ſhadows of the law, to draw a vail over the truth and glory of the goſpel. The word ſin, is uſed in the law for a ſin-offering; from whence many have tried to prove, that the words <hi>ſinned</hi> and <hi>ſinners</hi> in the goſpel, mean <hi>ſuffered</hi> and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers.</hi> Rom. v. 12, 19. That is, they would prove from thence, that all mankind are ſufferers, before they are ſinners. But as the wages of ſin is death, none can hold that he pays thoſe wages where they are not due, without implicitly denying the juſtice
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020214_0017_0FAE47212F0D93F8"/>of God, in his government of the world. Our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor takes the ſame truth in the law, and ſays from thence concerning Chriſt, "For him to be made <hi>ſin</hi> therefore, is for him to become a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> or an <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſin."</hi> Yet, becauſe actions are ſometimes aſcribed to God, which are performed by the devil and his children, and God ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel,</hi> Remmele ſays, "Let no one then be alarmed, if we poſitively deny, that he ſuffered any of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath which ſinners <hi>juſtly</hi> deſerve." P. 32, 33. Hence,</p>
            <p n="3">3. He denies the eſſence of atonement. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite excellency of Chriſt's teaching and example, was ſo far from making any atonement for ſin, that it enhanced the guilt of thoſe who deſpiſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him, above the guilt of the Sodomites, who <hi>ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire.</hi> Luke x. 12. Jude 7. Blood upon God's altar, offered by his prieſt, by fire from heaven, is the only thing which could make an atonement for the ſoul, as we have before proved. And two ſons of Aaron were ſtruck dead, <hi>becauſe they offered ſtrange fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not.</hi> Levi. ix. 15—24. x. 1—3. And how terrible muſt it be for any to imagine, that Chriſt was ſacrificed by the devil or his children, with fire from hell! Yet this is the natural effect of holding that the covenant of circumciſion is the covenant of grace. For Abraham had no warrant to circumciſe any perſon, who was not born in his houſe, until he had bought him as a <hi>ſervant</hi> with money. And ſince the death of Chriſt, by which he purchaſed his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the tongues of them who are for <hi>many maſters, defile the whole body, and ſet on fire the whole courſe of nature, and it is ſet on fire of hell.</hi> The wiſdom of men who have bitter envying and ſtrife in their hearts, is <hi>earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh. But the wiſdom
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020214_0018_0FAE4721E433A788"/>that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocriſy.</hi> James iii. 1, 6, 14—18. And the uſe of ſecular force to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port religious teachers, was always full of partiality and hypocriſy; and this appears by their own account of how it was firſt introduced under the Chriſtian name.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt gave loud warnings to Chriſtians, againſt obſerving days, months and years, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſhadows under the law. Gal. iv. 9—11. And againſt being ſpoiled through philoſophy and vain deceit, ſo as to be ſubjected to ordinances, after the commandments and doctrines of men; which is will-worſhip, and hath only a ſhew of humility. Col. ii. 8, 19—23. But the myſtery of iniquity was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſo far, in the ſecond and third centuries, as to call religious teachers prieſts, in diſtinction from other ſaints; and at length to ſet ſome teachers above the reſt, under the name of biſhops, with an imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that they could make times, places and perſons holy, by their decrees and adminiſtrations. This led on to the calling of wooden buildings churches, and baptiſm regeneration; as well as to the holding that office power in the church is derived by ſucceſſion from other officers, and not from the community as a body. In the mean time, heathen perſecution was become very odious, and the doctrine of a crucified Saviour very honorable; therefore, in the beginning of the fourth century, by a pretended revelation from heaven, the <hi>croſs</hi> was erected as a military ſtandard, to gratify, and not to crucify the fleſh. And then each biſhop was ſet up as a <hi>high-prieſt,</hi> to whom Conſtantine wrote, and ſaid, "You, and other biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, prieſts and deacons, ought to look unto the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing of ſuch <hi>churches</hi> as are under your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020214_0019_0FAE4722A2007F90"/>and juriſdiction; that thoſe which are yet ſtanding, may be repaired and enlarged; or new built if occaſion ſo require. And both you, and others in your name, may <hi>will</hi> and require the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and governors of provinces to furniſh you with materials neceſſary to the building or repairing thereof; for we have ſignified unto them by our royal letters, that they ſhall willingly and chearfully furniſh you with whatſover <hi>your holineſs</hi> ſhall think neceſſary thereunto." This was his language to each biſhop; and "He confirmed with his royal authority, the <hi>canons</hi> and determinations of the <hi>biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops,</hi> which they had decreed in their publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories, that ſo the <hi>princes</hi> of other nations might not abrogate their <hi>decrees.</hi> For the judgments of the <hi>prieſthood</hi> in eccleſiaſtical matters, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the opinion of a <hi>ſecular</hi> judge." And when he had gone on in this way until the thirtieth year of his reign, the hiſtorian ſaid, "His empire reſembleth the celeſtial empire, ſo that lifting up his eyes to heaven, he governeth his ſubjects in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior empire, according to the pattern and form of the heavenly empire. For Law, which is the King of all, hath preſcribed a Monarchy to be a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt ſuitable to prince and people; for a monarchy doth exceed all other kinds of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths and manners of government; for that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is various which conſiſteth in an Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, or government of men equal in riches and dignity; alſo a Democracy, or government of the people, which is oppoſed to a Monarchy, is rather a ſeditious confuſion than a government." Yet in all this time Conſtantine never ſubmitted to the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt. But when he found his health to fail, in the ſixty-fifth year of his age, he ſet off for the <hi>place</hi> where Jeſus was baptized; but when he came to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020214_0020_0FAE472362ECF2D0"/>Nicomedia, he perceived that he ſhould not reach there; and then he aſſembled a number of biſhops, and ſaid to them, "Brethren, the ſalvation which I have earneſtly deſired of God theſe many years, I do now this day expect; it is time therefore that we ſhould be <hi>ſealed</hi> and ſigned with the badge of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. And though I purpoſed to receive it <hi>in</hi> the river Jordan, <hi>in</hi> which our Saviour, for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, was baptized; yet God, knowing what is fitteſt for me, hath appointed that I ſhall receive it in this place, therefore let me not be delayed.

So that Conſtantine was the firſt of all the Emperors that was <hi>regenerated</hi> by the <hi>new birth</hi> of baptiſm, and that was ſigned with the ſign of the <hi>croſs,</hi> ſo that his ſpirit rejoiced, and being thus <hi>regenerated,</hi> his mind was illuminated, and by the raptures of faith ſo tranſported, that he admired in himſelf the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>work of God.</hi> After this ſacred ceremony was performed, being clothed now in robes of light, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of his robes of regality, he went home, and reſted upon his royal bed, putting off his royal robes, which he would not any more endure to touch.—Afterward he made his laſt will and teſtament, and hereby gave honorable annual penſions to the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Rome. He left unto his children the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of his empire for their patrimony, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of other matters in expreſs words as he thought convenient. Theſe things were performed in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020214_0021_0FAE4724692DC368"/>time of the holy feaſt of Pentecoſt, beginning on the ſeventh Sunday after Eſter, in a holy remembrance of the confirmation of the ſcriptures, by the aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt into heaven, and the deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt upon men. On the laſt day of this feſtival, the Emperor having thus diſpoſed of all matters, died about noontide, leaving his mortal part to the earth; but his intelligible and divine part went to God.—The prieſts and people, with tears and lamentations, prayed unto God for the Emperor's ſoul; which prayers, though they were not much available, yet God ſo bleſſed his ſervant Conſtantine, that his ſons ſucceeded him in his Empire; and as he deſired, he had his tomb in the Apoſtles Church; and enjoyed the benefit of the <hi>maſſes</hi> and prayers read therein."<note n="*" place="bottom">Euſebius's life of Conſtantine; London edition, 1663, p. 3, 9, 29, 61, 70, 71, 73, 96.</note>

            <p>This is the account of how <hi>a form of godlineſs</hi> was then adopted as an engine of ſtate-policy; given by a biſhop who was very active therein, and who alſo wrote the hiſtory of the church, from the birth of Chriſt, unto the death of Conſtantine, with raiſed expectations of glorious effects that would follow. But what were the effects? By removing the ſeat of the Empire to Conſtantinople, and dividing it among his three ſons, Conſtantine prepared the way for its being rent and torn to pieces, and for the biſhop of Rome to advance himſelf above all men upon earth, and above the God of heaven, whoſe Son came into the world to <hi>bear witneſs unto the truth, and to deſtroy the works of the devil,</hi> which are <hi>lying and murder.</hi> John viii. 44. xviii. 36, 37. 1 John iii. 7—14. And theſe evils were carried ſo far, before England was ſubjected to the Pope of Rome, that becauſe the firſt archbiſhop of Canterbury could not effect it by
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020214_0022_0FAE4727C4509D40"/>fair means, he ſaid to a ſynod of miniſters, "Since you refuſe peace from your brethren, you ſhall have wars from your enemies; and ſince you will not join with us in preaching the word of eternal life to your neighbours, you ſhall receive death from their hands;" as ſome thouſands of them did ſoon after. And they purſued this bloody way until 1533, when the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England forbid any more appeals to Rome, and ſet up their King as the head of the church.<note n="†" place="bottom">Rapin's hiſtory of England, vol. 1. p. 47, 68, 797.</note>

            <p>America had been diſcovered forty years before, and it was granted to the crown of Spain, by the Pope of Rome. But the crown of England ſoon after claimed the ſame power, and hath exerciſed <hi>all the power of the firſt beaſt therein,</hi> even down to our times. For God himſelf never claimed any higher power, than to bind us in all caſes whatſoever. And the Son of God refuſed to make uſe of the <hi>ſword</hi> to ſet up his kingdom, John xviii. 36, 37. Therefore the heads of the churches, both of Rome and Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, have exalted themſelves above the eternal God, who never could be guilty of <hi>lying</hi> nor <hi>perjury,</hi> nor of <hi>enticing</hi> any into ſin. 2 Theſſ. ii. 3—12. Heb. vi. 17, 18. James i. 13—15. No wonder then that their worſhippers are given to a ſtrong deluſion to believe a lie.</p>
            <p>In 1602 a number of Chriſtians in the joining borders of Nottinghamſhire, Lincolnſhire, and York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, obtained ſo much light from the word of God, as openly to withdraw from the church of England, "And as the Lord's free people, joined themſelves by covenant into a church-ſtate, to walk in all his ways, made known, or to be made known to them, according to their beſt endeavours, whatever it coſt them."<note n="*" place="bottom">New-England Chronology, p. 4.</note> For this they were cruelly perſecuted in England, which cauſed their flight into Holland,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020214_0023_0FAE47290C9052E8"/>where they were purſued with injurious publications, under the name of Separatiſts and Independents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they held that the church ought to be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the world, and to be governed wholly by the laws and Spirit of Chriſt. It was held in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that the commanding power of the civil autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity took away the offence, that men might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe give to weak brethren, in their uſe of indifferent things. Upon which it was ſaid, "What more was ever given to the Pope, than that he might <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with the <hi>moral law?</hi> And what leſs is given to the King, when by his authority I uſe things indifferent with offence to my weak brother? Is not love the fulfilling of the law? and is it not againſt the law of love to uſe things indifferent with offence? 1 Cor. viii. 11.

            <p>Ten years after, thoſe Independents came over and planted New-England; where their foundation principles now loudly call for the attention of their poſterity, without which our INDEPENDENCE can never be maintained. For if we believe not, yet God abideth faithful; he cannot deny himſelf. 2 Tim. ii. 13. And not to condemn ourſelves in the things which we allow, is the only way of happineſs. Rom. xiv. 22. Every man who violates the univerſal rule of equity, exalteth himſelf above the eternal God, who never could do any ſuch thing, and never will let the violation of it eſcape without puniſhment in any one inſtance. It is therefore impoſſible that ſin can ever eſcape without puniſhment, either in the guilty perſon, or in his Surety. And we may now ſee that <hi>reviling</hi> and <hi>lying</hi> is the moſt dangerous <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi> in the world, as it hath obſcured <hi>the light</hi> more than corporal tortures ever did. Mat. v. 10—16. <hi>Natural men</hi> have always <hi>perſecuted</hi> thoſe who were

Secondly, becauſe the light of holineſs is directly againſt <hi>covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs</hi> which is <hi>idolatry;</hi> and the command of God is, <hi>Be not ye partakers with them.</hi> Eph. v. 1—7, 11.

Paul ſays, <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon me—leſt that by any means when I have preached to others, I myſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</hi> 1 Cor. ix. 16—27.

The Hebrew and Chriſtian churches are his two candleſticks, into which he poured the oil of his grace, by his law and his goſpel, the two olive-trees; the one revealing duty plainly, the other how it is performed acceptably, in his <hi>kingdom which cannot be moved.</hi> And every thing which can be ſhaken, is evidently now ſhaking, that <hi>the deſire of all nations may come, and his houſe be filled with glory.</hi> Hag. ii. 6—9. Zech. iv. 2—12. Heb. xii. 18—29. Safety and happineſs is the deſire of all nations; and this will be gloriouſly enjoyed when the witneſſes ſhall be raiſed above all earthly powers, <hi>and the kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt. And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was ſeen in his temple the ark of his teſtament.</hi> Rev. xi. 11—19. The firſt tables of the law were broken by man, but the ſecond tables were kept whole in the ark; and the mercy-ſeat was above upon it, juſt as long and juſt as broad as the ark. Over it was the cloud of glory, and none but the high-prieſt might go into the holy place where it was, and that but once a year, with the holy garments on, to ſprinkle blood upon it, and to offer incenſe, by fire which came from heaven, and was kept alive upon the altar for burnt-offerings. And the people were to <hi>afflict their ſouls</hi> without, while the prieſt made atonement within. Levi. xvi. 13, 14, 24, 29, 34. After the Babylonian captivity, the Jews la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the want of the ark, the cloud of glory, the holy garments, and the fire from heaven; but Chriſt hath them all to perfection, and we are moſt ſolemnly called to <hi>go on unto perfection.</hi> And nothing hath done more to obſtruct it, than the imagination, that an <hi>external ſucceſſion of baptiſm, and laying on of hands,</hi> is eſſential to any true church power in this world. Heb. vi. 1—6. Aaron and his ſons were <hi>waſhed</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:020214_0026_0FAE472BAC5DCDA8"/>before their holy garments were put upon them, and then they <hi>laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the ſin-offering.</hi> Levi. viii. 6—8, 14. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were unclean, were to be ſprinkled with the aſhes of a burnt heifer, and then each one was to <hi>waſh his clothes, and bathe himſelf in water, and ſo be clean.</hi> Num. xix. 19. Which divers <hi>baptiſms</hi> were a figure of what Chriſt hath done to purge our conſcience from dead works to ſerve the living God. He is <hi>light,</hi> and he <hi>is love;</hi> and <hi>if we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive ourſelves, and the truth is not in us. If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs. This is he that came by water and blood.</hi> 1 John i. 5—10. iv. 8. v. 6. And as God is light and love, every rational ſoul is under indiſpenſable obligation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all his revealed will, and to obey all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
            <p>All the light that ever was enjoyed by fallen men, came from the <hi>Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> But <hi>every one that doth evil hateth the light;</hi> and <hi>this is the condemnation. They hate him without a cauſe.</hi> And he ſays the Spirit reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me.</hi> John i. 9, 29. iii. 14—21. xv. 25. xvi. 9. He was <hi>within</hi> the Jewiſh church, when he warned them againſt looking any where elſe for his kingdom. Luke xvii. 21. But he is now at the right hand of the Father, making his people willing in the day of his power, to ſerve him in the beauties of holineſs. And he will yet ſtrike through Kings in the day of his wrath, and wound the heads over many countries. Pſalm cx. 1—3, 5, 6. Rev. xix. 11—21. But many have been in ſuch blindneſs, as to bring theſe ſcriptures to prove that God had ſet up a <hi>light within them,</hi> above his written word. Well therefore did he ſay,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020214_0027_0FAE472C6A817070"/>
               <hi>If the light that is in thee be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs!</hi> Mat. vi. 23. Had it not been for ſuch darkneſs, men would not have told of God's <hi>exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> any from his free ſalvation; nor of his <hi>deſigning</hi> atonement for any who are finally loſt. No, nor of any want of ſincerity, in his proclaiming free grace to all, becauſe he did not deſign to exert the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatneſs of his power,</hi> to bring all to <hi>believe</hi> therein. Eph. i. 19. Neither would men have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the plain truth of God, who ſays, <hi>As by one man's diſobedience, many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> The one by a <hi>juſt</hi> ſentence of law; the other by a free <hi>gift</hi> of grace. The firſt man, by one offence ruined all his race; the ſecond man, delivers from <hi>many offences unto the juſtification of life.</hi> Rom. v. 12—19. The ſin which we derive from Adam, is loving the creature more than the Creator, or loving of pleaſures more than God. Rom. i. 25. 2 Tim. iii. 1—5. This is to be <hi>dead while we live.</hi> 1 Tim. v. 6. Eph. ii. 1, 2. Hence to be <hi>taught of God,</hi> is the only way wherein any <hi>can come</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>every man</hi> who hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto him. John vi 44, 45. The excellency which this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge brings them, is, gladly to quit all confidence in the fleſh, and to place their truſt and affections upon things above, where God is, and Chriſt at his right hand.</p>
