            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE NARRATIVE OF MR. JOHN SOREN.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>☞ IT has ſeldom happened that the wrongs of an Individual have had a greater claim to the attention of the Public than thoſe which are the ſubject of the following Narrative. The generous and diſintereſted conduct of the benefactor has never been more ſtrikingly contraſted with the ingratitude and perſidy of the object of his humanity: the national character of Engliſhmen was never more diſhonoured than in the character of Captain Potter of the <hi>Iſabella;</hi> and the credit of Government was never more deeply intereſted in any thing than in taking care that the injuries of <hi>Mr. SOREN</hi> ſhall not remain unredreſſed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>MR. JOHN SOREN, a native of Boſton, in the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts, a citizen of the United States of America, and a partner in the houſe of Holyoke and Soren, in Boſton, being, in the month of November, in the year 1795, at Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, freighted an American ſhip called the <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> then lying there, of the burthen of 170 laſts, or 340 tons, on a voyage from thence to Surinam, and from Surinam back to Hamburgh. The ſhip was the property of Mr. Clough, of Witchcaſſet, in the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts, alſo a native and citizen of America. The charter-party was made between Mr. Soren, on behalf of Mr, Holyoke and himſelf, as freighters, and Wyatt St. Barbe, a native of England, and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038531_0003_10125093D1776F80"/>
30 years a citizen of America, but then reſiding at Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, as maſter and commander of the ſhip, on behalf of the owner. By that charter-party <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the Charter-party, Appendix, No. 1.</note>, dated the 24th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1795, and regularly atteſted by a notary-public, the freighters engaged to ſhip on board the veſſel, on her ſafe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Surinam, a full convenient cargo of Weſt-Indian products, to be brought back to the port of Hamburgh, and to make the Captain's allowance of privilege, as in ſimilar caſes: the ſtipulated freight for the outward and homeward voyage was 2600<hi>l.</hi> ſterling, with 15<hi>l.</hi> per cent. primage for the whole ſhip's hold. The object of Mr. Soren was, to ſhip at Hamburgh a ſufficient cargo fit for the market at Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinam; and, by the produce of that cargo, and by means of letters of credit which he had obtained on Surinam, to the amount of nearly 15,000<hi>l.</hi> ſterling in the whole, to purchaſe, at Surinam, coffee ſufficient to load, not only the <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> but ſeveral other ſhips, which he intended to freight at Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam or other ports, the comparative prices of that article, at Surinam and at Hamburgh, at that time affording him the beſt ground to expect that his adventure would prove a very profitable ſpeculation. In proſecution of this object, he ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped on board the <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> at Hamburgh, goods to the amount, in prime coſt, of 3200<hi>l.</hi> and upwards<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the Bills of Lading and Invoice, No. 2 and 3 in the Appendix.</note>, and cauſed inſurances to be effected on them, and on the ſuppoſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, by underwriters at Hamburgh, to the amount of 5000<hi>l.</hi> and upwards. Captain St. Barbe at the ſame time ſhipped linen, groceries, liquors and glaſs, on account of himſelf and Meſſrs. Furſt and Co. citizens and burghers of Hamburgh, to the amount, in prime coſt, of 901<hi>l.</hi> 8s. 11d. ſterling.</p>
            <p>On or about the 5th of February 1796, Mr. Soren ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> on his intended voyage. On the 25th of the ſame month, being in latitude 44° 1′ north, longitude 18° 35′ weſt, at one <hi>p. m.</hi> Captain St. Barbe and Mr. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren obſerved a ſhip towards the ſouth-weſt, with an Engliſh enſign <hi>reverſed,</hi> which they conſidered as a ſignal of diſtreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they ſailed towards her, and about four o'clock <hi>p. m.</hi> came up with her, and learned ſhe was the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> belonging to Meſſrs.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038531_0004_101250964319ABB0"/>
Tarleton and Backhouſe, of Liverpool, Charles Potter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; that ſhe had a letter of marque, and had been freighted by the Britiſh Tranſport-office to carry nearly 300 troops from Cork to Barbadoes: ſhe was in a very leaky and almoſt ſinking condition, both pumps inceſſantly going. The Captain, with one of his mates, came on board the <hi>Enterpriſe;</hi> and, having ſhortly informed Captain St. Barbe and Mr. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of the perilous ſituation in which he found himſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted them to ſee him into Liſbon or Corunna: Captain St. Barbe replied, that to go to either of thoſe places, would be too great a deviation from his voyage; but that, with Mr. Soren's approbation, he would with much pleaſure accompany him to Madeira, Teneriffe, or any of the Windward Iſlands; and render him every ſervice in his power, conſiſtently with the duty he owed to the owners and proprietors of his ſhip and cargo: Mr. Soren readily aſſented. Potter ſeemed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced at the propoſition, and ſaid he would ſend on board his own ſhip for the approbation of the commander of the troops<note n="*" place="bottom">Captain Manſergh, now Major Manſergh.</note>: he ſent his mate accordingly; but not to communicate to the commander of the troops, or to his crew, the humane offer of Mr. Soren and Mr. St. Barbe! The reader will be ſtartled at the relation which follows; he will with difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the poſſibility of a tranſaction ſo replete with perfidy and ingratitude: it is nevertheleſs true, and can be eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond contradiction by the teſtimony of all the officers of the troops then on board the <hi>Iſabella</hi> who are now alive: This monſter in human ſhape, without a ſhadow of proof, without the ſlighteſt ground of ſuſpicion, without having ſeen a ſingle article of the cargo, or a ſingle paper, without having had any communication with any one on board but Captain St. Barbe and Mr. Soren, at the very moment when he was expreſſing his thanks for their kindneſs, which was to reſcue him, his paſſengers and crew, from almoſt inevitable deſtruction, had conceived the diabolical project of making priſoners of his benefactors, and ſeizing their ſhip as a prize! He whiſpered to his mate; the mate obeyed the ſuggeſtion: he returned on board the <hi>Iſabella</hi>; he brought back with him on board the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038531_0005_10125098AAF8A410"/>
               <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> a party of ſoldiers and ſailors, with muſquets and bayonets fixed: Potter, on their arrival, inſiſted the ſhip was French; that the cargo conſiſted of French and Dutch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; that the Captain muſt be a Frenchman, becauſe his name was "<hi>St. Barbe;</hi>" and that Mr. Soren had two ſets of papers! Remonſtrance was vain: the miſcreant took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the ſhip as a prize; made Mr. Soren and the chief mate, the carpenter, and eight of the ſeamen, priſoners; and drove them, with piſtols cocked at their breaſts, and at the point of the bayonet, out of their own ſhip into the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> which was every moment in danger of ſinking!</p>
            <p>It was afterwards learned, that Captain Potter, when the <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> approached the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> repreſented to the officers of the King's troops that ſhe was an enemy, and was bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down upon them in order to attack; that the officers, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving her inferior ſize, the ſmall number of men on board, and no appearance of guns or of warlike preparation, reaſoned with him againſt this repreſentation; that, nevertheleſs, and notwithſtanding the perilous condition of his own ſhip, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the guns to be got ready, and the ſoldiers to be arrayed on deck, ready for an attack; and that it was this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which enabled him, with ſuch promptitude and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to obtain from the officers the party of ſoldiers who took poſſeſſion of the <hi>Enterpriſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Mr. Soren arrived on board the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and ſtated the circumſtances of his ſituation, and the manner in which he had been treated by Potter, the officers of the troops, whoſe humanity and polite attention to the ſufferers reflects on them the higheſt honour, reprobated in the ſevereſt terms the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human conduct of Potter; and Captain Manſergh, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding officer, declared, that had he known the real cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the caſe when Potter ſent to him for a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he would not have permitted it to go.</p>
            <p>Potter having, in the manner before ſtated, taken poſſeſſion of the <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> continued on board her till the following day, when he obliged Captain St. Barbe to deliver up to him, as well the greateſt part of the ſhip's papers, and thoſe relating to the cargo, as many others of a private nature: after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining them, he began to rummage the hold; and, after
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038531_0006_1012509B14D5FC00"/>
breaking open ſeveral caſes and boxes, took out gin, proviſions, and whatever he thought proper, and afterwards gave them to the guard of ſoldiers, in whoſe charge he left the ſhip.</p>
            <p>When he returned on board the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the officers of the troops remonſtrated with him on the impropriety of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and adviſed him to releaſe the <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> as there was not the ſlighteſt colour for his taking her as prize: he told them that it was no buſineſs of theirs; that they were only paſſengers; produced his letter of marque, which, however, only comprehended <hi>French</hi> property; that his owners, Meſſrs. Tarleton and Backhouſe, were perſons of property, and were reſponſible for his conduct; and that, if, through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the officers, he ſhould be obliged to part with his prize, they muſt anſwer to his owners. In addition to what he had ſaid the day before, he declared, what was moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly falſe, "that he knew St. Barbe well, that he was a rogue, and that, if he had him in England, he had papers ſufficient to hang him."</p>
            <p>Mr. Soren repreſented to him, that after the humanity of Mr. St. Barbe, manifeſted to him and nearly 300 perſons on board his veſſel, his conduct was reprehenſible in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme; and requeſted, as he was completely in his power, that he might be permitted to return to the <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> rather than remain, on board the <hi>Iſabella:</hi> Potter replied, that Mr. Soren was his priſoner, and that he would conduct the two ſhips to the Rock of Liſbon, and from thence ſend the <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe</hi> to Barbadoes for condemnation. Mr. Soren then repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, that he acted in open defiance of the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in direct violation of the treaty lately concluded between Great Britain and America; and deſired that he would, as he propoſed, direct the ſhip's courſe to Liſbon, where they might both have ample juſtice done to their cauſe. Potter then ſhifted his ground; he pretended that he could not reach Liſbon. The officers of the troops deſired that he would ſteer for Madeira, to which Captain St. Barbe had at firſt offered to accompany him: to this he apparently agreed; but ſteered to Teneriffe.</p>
            <p>When arrived at Teneriffe, Mr. Soren requeſted his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to go on ſhore: the anſwer was, "You may jump in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038531_0007_1012509CD56E7EF8"/>
the ſea, if you like it; but neither you nor Captain St. Barbe ſhall go on ſhore till the arrival of the Britiſh Conſul." That gentleman was then at the Grand Canary. Captain Manſergh interpoſed, and almoſt by force took Mr. St. Barbe on ſhore with him in his boat; they applied to the Governor of Teneriffe, and, by their repreſentation, obtained an order for Mr. Soren's being alſo permitted to land. In conſequence of this order, Mr. Soren, after having been detained upwards of twenty-four hours, landed on Teneriffe, literally a ſtranger, without money, without friends, ſtripped of every thing, his gold watch<note n="*" place="bottom">The watch was afterwards reſtored, with five guineas of his money, by the good offices of Captain Manſergh.</note>, his caſh, all his private property, except a few articles of wearing apparel!</p>
            <p>In a few days, the Britiſh ſhip <hi>Iſabella</hi> was condemned, as incapable of proceeding on her voyage. The fact, on inquiry, turns out to be, that this ſhip was upwards of thirty years old, and, at the time when ſhe was freighted to Government, was unfit to be ſent to ſea; and had it not been for the continued exertions of the ſoldiers at the pumps, and, even notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe exertions, had ſhe met with a ſevere gale of wind, ſhe muſt have gone to the bottom.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond day after the arrival at Teneriffe, Captain Potter began to tranſhip from on board the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> on board the <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> military ſtores and baggage, and to unſtow the cargo of the <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> breaking open ſome packages, and ſtarting others, for the purpoſe of ſitting up births for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of the ſoldiers, who, to the number of 150, with women and children, beſide the crew of the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> were afterwards embarked on board the <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> on which Porter hoiſted the Britiſh jack enſign and flag. During the detention of the <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> at Teneriffe, through the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Potter and his crew, ſhe experienced almoſt every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of injury, and was ſo much damaged, that when ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Barbadoes ſhe was much reduced in value.</p>
            <p>While at Teneriffe, application was made by Captain St. Barbe to Peter Favene, Eſq. the Britiſh Conſul there, for an inveſtigation of Potter's conduct. That gentleman, though fully ſatisfied, from the peruſal of the documents produced,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038531_0008_1012509F9B816990"/>
that there was no foundation for ſeizing the <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> as a prize, and though he ſtrongly reprobated the conduct of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet declined to interpoſe, from an opinion that, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, he had no power to make the required inveſtigation; and referred the parties to a regular Court of Admiralty at Barbadoes, whither Potter ſaid he intended to carry the ſhip for condemnation <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Mr. Favene's Letter to Charles Long, Eſq. Secretary to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury.—Appendix, No. 4.</note>.</p>
            <p>On the voyage to Teneriffe, Potter, by plying the ſailors of the <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> with liquor, and by promiſes, endeavoured to prevail on them to give evidence that the <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> was a French or Dutch ſhip. Finding his atttempts by entreaties ineffectual, he put them on an allowance of bread and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and, even of theſe, a <hi>ſcanty</hi> allowance. By this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the health of the mariners was much injured, and more particularly that of the carpenter, who, in addition to other ill-treatment, was kept in irons, as a puniſhment for refuſing to ſwear to the effect Potter wiſhed him to do. With two only was he able to ſucceed, who afterwards declared they were induced from threats and ill treatment, and that what they had been prevailed upon to depoſe was falſe, and extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them in the hopes of obtaining an alleviation of their ſufferings.—As a proof that his underſtanding was as weak as his heart was wicked, he alſo attempted to tarniſh the honour of the Britiſh military, who certainly do not hold in light eſtimation that delicate point, by promiſing them a ſhare of the prize, as he termed it, with him; they diſdainfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed his offer, and expreſſed their united diſapprobation of his conduct in manly and unequivocal terms.</p>
            <p>Previous to the departure of the <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> for Barbadoes, Mr. Soren requeſted Potter to permit him to have his private effects, not forming a part of the cargo: he refuſed to reſtore a ſingle article, except ſome private letters of trifling import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. He carried his brutality farther: he refuſed Mr. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren a paſſage to Barbadoes, "unleſs he would go in the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way;</hi>" in other words, "unleſs he would go in the ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and he turned Mr. St. Barbe, who, with Mr. Harlow his mate, proceeded to Barbadoes, out of his ſtate room, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038531_0009_101250A2CB772E40"/>
the remonſtrances of the Britiſh officers that he ought to be permitted to remain in poſſeſſion of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Soren being refuſed a paſſage in the <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> in a decent way, was adviſed by Captains Manſergh and Thomas to leave the conduct of the buſineſs at Barbadoes to Mr. St. Barbe, and to come himſelf to England, where it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he might obtain redreſs for the injuries he had ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. How far this ſuppoſition was well-founded, will be ſeen in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>On the 25th of March 1796, Potter ſailed in the <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe</hi> from Teneriffe, and, on the 16th of April following, arrived in Carliſle Bay, Barbadoes. Potter then exhibited a libel againſt the ſhip and cargo, as prize, in the Vice-Admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty Court there; to which a claim was entered by Captain St. Barbe, on behalf of himſelf and the owner of the ſhip, and the ſeveral perſons intereſted in her cargo; and a petition was preferred by him to the Judge of the Court, praying that the libellant might be compelled to give ſecurity for coſts, in caſe the ſhip and cargo ſhould not be condemned as good and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prize. This petition, after argument of counſel, was granted, and Potter not giving ſecurity as ordered, the libel was diſmiſſed <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the Proceedings of the Court, Appendix, No. 5, (A.)</note>; on which Mr. St. Barbe petitioned the Court for damages. Potter filed a petition, praying that an attachment might iſſue againſt the ſhip and cargo, alleging that ſufficient evidence had been obtained to prove them the property of an enemy, until he or the King's Advocate-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſhould proceed further againſt them: this petition being granted, a libel was filed by the King's Advocate-General againſt the ſhip and cargo as a droit of the Admiralty; and this on the very day appointed for the inveſtigation of the merits of Captain St. Barbe's petition for damages <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the Affidavit of Captain St. Barbe, Appendix, No. 6.</note>. To this libel Captain St. Barbe alſo put in his claim on behalf of himſelf and the owner of the ſhip and proprietors of the cargo; and the caſe being heard, the ſhip and cargo were ordered to be reſtored <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the Proceedings of the Court, Appendix, No. 5, (B.)</note>.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:038531_0010_101250A53095A328"/>Captain St. Barbe wiſhed then to renew his petition for damages; but he was adviſed by his counſel that it would be to no purpoſe, as Potter had in the mean time abſconded, and had no property within the reach of the Court, and as the King's Advocate paid no damages <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> Captain St. Barbe's Affidavit, Appendix, No. 6.</note>.</p>
            <p>It has been ſtated that Potter had plundered the ſhip; he had expended a great quantity of the ſtores; many periſhable articles were completely ſpoiled; the dry goods which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unplundered, were much damaged; the ſhip had been robbed of great part of her materials, and was otherwiſe much injured; the worm had got into her bottom; and Captain St. Barbe found it abſolutely neceſſary to proceed to Alexandria in America, to have her ſheathed and repaired. When ſhe had undergone ſuch repairs, which amounted to between 3000<hi>l.</hi> and 4000<hi>l.,</hi> he returned with her to Hamburgh, the place to which ſhe was to have returned after ſhe ſhould have made her voyage to Surinam.</p>
            <p>Before the ſhip's departure from Barbadoes, the remainder of her cargo, from the depredations of Potter, was ſold for 2779<hi>l.</hi> 8<hi>s.</hi> 0¾<hi>d.</hi>; from which, deducting the expences of ſale, amounting to 270<hi>l.</hi> 3<hi>s.</hi> 1½<hi>d.</hi> there remained the ſum of 2509<hi>l.</hi> 5<hi>s.</hi> 5¼<hi>d.</hi> Barbadoes currency; in ſterling money, 1756<hi>l.</hi> 9<hi>s.</hi> 9¾<hi>d.</hi>; a loſs being thus ſuſtained of 2349<hi>l.</hi> 12<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> on the prime coſt of the cargo at Hamburgh. The loſs on the whole of this tranſaction, to Captain St. Barbe and his owner, and to Mr. Soren and his partner, amounted in the whole to 11,553<hi>l.</hi> 19<hi>s.</hi> 8½<hi>d.</hi> ſterling <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> the Statement in the Appendix, No. 7.</note>, independently of the loſs of the voyage, and the probable advantage which might have accrued from it.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Soren was informed of what had paſſed in the Vice-Admiralty Court at Barbadoes, he directed Captain St. Barbe to apply to the Underwriters at Hamburgh, from whom he received the following anſwer:—
<q>You are not entitled to recover, inaſmuch as, having borne down to the relief of his Majeſty's tranſport, laden with troops, in diſtreſs, you altered the ſhip's regular courſe, and deviated from

—To the credit of the character of the Britiſh merchants, Mr. Soren has been informed by ſeveral Gentlemen at Lloyd's, that he would not have received ſuch an anſwer from the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writers at that place.</p>
            <p>Mr. Soren was now adviſed to have his caſe drawn up, and ſubmitted to the opinion of Counſel. A caſe was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly prepared, and laid before Mr. Gibbs, one of His Majeſty's Counſel: In this caſe it was ſtated, that, on the ſailing of a letter of marque, ſecurity is given for any damage or injury which may be done to any of His Majeſty's ſubjects, or of foreign ſtates in amity with His Majeſty; and that, in the caſe of the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> a bond had been given in the penalty of 1500l.—and the following Query was put:</p>
            <p>
               <q>What ſteps ought the unfortunate ſufferers to purſue to ſeek redreſs for their ſeveral injuries? Muſt ſuch redreſs be ſought by actions at law againſt Meſſrs. Tarleton and Backhouſe, the owners of the letter of marque, as Potter, the commander of her, is run away? And will ſuch actions lie? And in that caſe, and on ſeparate actions being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, cannot Soren, St. Barbe, and Clough, be evidence for each other, as to the extent of the injuries ſuffered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally? And is the bond for 1500l., given by Jordan, Kembie, and Sowerby, aſſignable for the benefit of the ſufferers? And, ought an application to be made to the Lords of the Admiralty in this caſe, or whom elſe, by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition or otherwiſe, to direct the ſame to be put in ſuit? And, upon the whole, point out what ſteps they ought to take to ſeek effectual redreſs; and, if actions are maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, what evidence will be neceſſary to ſupport ſuch actions.</q>

                        <p>The application of the parties in this caſe ought to have been to the Court of Vice-Admiralty for coſts and damages, it being the proper duty of that Court, not only to make reſtitution where it is due, but likewiſe to decree coſts and damages when the capture was groſsly improper. If the Judge refuſe improperly to decree coſts and damages, an appeal lies from that refuſal; but I do not think that any common law juriſdiction either can or will examine the queſtion whether the capture was unjuſt or not: it is a queſtion merely of Admiralty cognizance; and if the Court of Admiralty or Court of Appeals has not decreed it to be an illegal ſeizure, a Court of Common Law will not take upon itſelf to pronounce ſuch a judgment.

<q>That the ſhip called the <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella</hi> was not a <hi>regular</hi> tranſport in the ſervice of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only <hi>freighted</hi> by them to carry troops to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes; and that, therefore, their department, or their agents, were not reſponſible, but the maſter of the <hi>Iſabella</hi>

            <p>In what terms can the conduct of that man be adequately reprehended, who could juſtify a miſcreant who had committed a piracy which diſgraces humanity?—Mr. Soren pities Mr. John Tarleton, and would not exchange ſituations with him, were his fortune ten times what it is; and, with this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, let Mr. John Tarleton be diſmiſſed.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the ſuggeſtions of ſome profeſſional men at Liverpool, Mr. Soren entertained ſome hope, that all legal redreſs againſt Meſſrs. Tarleton and Backhouſe was not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſhut againſt him: he therefore laid his caſe, with ſome additional circumſtances and obſervations, before Mr. Park, who conſidered it as a caſe of much compaſſion; but his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was equally unfavourable to Mr. Soren's claim to <hi>legal</hi> redreſs with thoſe which had preceded it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Park's opinion was in the following words:</p>

                        <p>I have peruſed all the papers laid before me with conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable attention; and although I think it a caſe of unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled hardſhip, and infamous miſconduct, yet I am ſorry to ſay, that as theſe proceedings have taken place <hi>under colour of prize,</hi> and as a Court of Admiralty has already taken cognizance of, and come to an adjudication upon, the principal matter, I am of opinion the miſconduct of the Captain, either by an action againſt him or his owners, is not now triable in Great Britain in a Court of <hi>municipal law.</hi> I am aware that Mr. Soren was not perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to lay his claim before the Vice-Admiralty Court of Barbadoes: but I think that makes no difference; for, in contemplation of the law of England, the ſentence of a Court of Admiralty binds every man; and the Captain, though not ſpecially ſo conſtituted, was the agent of all parties as to this purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>I have alſo attentively read the caſe of Le Caux <hi>v.</hi> Eden, referred to in the opinion given by Mr. Gibbs; and I am clearly of opinion, that although the circumſtances of that caſe are very different from, and not to be compared in

The general principle there eſtabliſhed, as well as in Rous <hi>v.</hi> Haſſard, and in Livingſton <hi>v.</hi> Welch, is, that although an action of treſpaſs would lie for <hi>taking a ſhip or goods,</hi> or impriſoning, or otherwiſe cruelly treating a man on the <hi>high ſeas</hi>; yet, when it is taken as prize, though taken wrongfully, though it be reſtored, though there be no colour for the taking (as here), the Judge of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty muſt judge of all the aggravation and conſequences, as well as of the principal matter; and if an action were brought in a Court of common law in England, the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff could not recover.</p>
                        <p>What redreſs Mr. Soren can obtain in a Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty in the preſent ſtage of the buſineſs, he has already been informed by men very competent to adviſe him; and I fear he can have no other remedy than by an application to the favour of the Britiſh Government, whoſe ſubject has behaved in a moſt oppreſſive, wicked, and inhuman manner.</p>

            <p>Sir William returned the following anſwer:</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  </opener>
                  <p>I am honoured with your Lordſhip's letter, dated Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 21, incloſing the copy of a letter received from Mr. Soren, and deſiring me to report to your Lordſhip the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the caſe, and the grounds on which legal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs is rendered impoſſible. In obedience to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's requeſt, I have conſidered the ſame; and report to your Lordſhip, that the ſhip <hi>Enterpriſe,</hi> belonging to Mr. Soren, an American ſubject, was taken and carried into Barbadoes by the Britiſh letter of marque ſhip <hi>Iſabella,</hi> in a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038531_0018_101250B8FA326060"/>
manner, as Mr. Soren has uniformly repreſented it, very inconſiſtent with juſtice and good faith. That proceedings were commenced in the Vice-Admiralty Court of that iſland, by the decree of which the veſſel was finally liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated; but, that no coſts and damages were awarded—none having been proved on the part of the owner. That all avenue to legal redreſs is irrevocably cloſed, by this omiſſion on the part of the owner, or his agent; for, that a ſimple reſtitution having been accepted in the Court below, the proceedings there were completely finiſhed, and cannot be revived by a new demand for coſts and damages, which had never been urged in the original cauſe: and, for the ſame reaſon, no ſuch demand can be addreſſed to the Court of Appeals; the ſentence having been accepted by the owner or his agent in an unqualified manner, and without any ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior demand, from the rejection of which he might legally have appealed. And as to a Court of common law, to which he was adviſed to reſort, it is ſufficient to obſerve, that that Court has no juriſdiction upon ſubjects of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but that the matter of prize, with all its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, as well of coſts and damages, as of every other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, belongs, altogether and excluſively, to the Courts of Admiralty.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordſhip will, therefore, be pleaſed to obſerve, that the hardſhip of this caſe, whatever may be its extent, ariſes entirely from the neglect of the owner or his agent; which Mr. Soren juſtifies or excuſes, by imputing it to ill advice adminiſtered in the iſland. One certain hardſhip I have already pointed out to be the entire loſs of legal redreſs; and with reſpect to redreſs of an equitable nature, it is not perhaps too harſh to remark, that if a country provides Courts of Juſtice and a regular courſe of legal proceedings for the reparation of wrongs done by its ſubjects to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of foreign powers, it has done all that the intercourſe of nations requires; and that the dereliction of ſuch legal remedies, under the plea of private ill advice which the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have received to that effect, has not been held, as far as I know, to found a demand upon the equity of the public Government of the country. It is, however, due to the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038531_0019_101250BB62CF9348"/>
claimant to remark, that he has, in his preſent application, ſtated a public ſervice of conſiderable merit towards the King's Government, in the conveyance of His Majeſty's forces, on board his veſſel, to the iſland of Barbadoes, when the <hi>Iſabella</hi> tranſport was incapable of conveying them; and I ſubmit to your Lordſhip's judgment, how far the proof of ſuch a fact, aided by ſuch circumſtances of the caſe as addreſs themſelves to compaſſion, may entitle the party to be favourably conſidered by his Majeſty's Government.</p>

            <p>In conſequence of information received by Mr. Soren, that my Lord Grenville, as well as Mr. Dundas, were favourably diſpoſed to him, and had actually interfered on his behalf and that a correſpondence had been held by letter on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, with others of his Majeſty's Miniſters, he was adviſed to endeavour to obtain copies of ſuch correſpondence; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he made application at the Tranſport-Office, from which, on the 7th of April laſt, he obtained, among others, copies of the above three letters.</p>
            <p>What report the Commiſſioners of the Tranſport-office made in conſequence of Mr. Dundas's recommendation of the caſe to their conſideration, Mr. Soren has not learned; but he was informed at that office, that it was the opinion of ſome perſons there that the Lords of the Treaſury ought to cauſe to be paid to him, the amount of the loſs ſuſtained on his cargo, as well as the freight for the conveyance of the troops. He renewed his attendance at the Treaſury, and continued it every Board-day till the month of July following, when he was informed by Mr. Long, that the Lords of the Treaſury had directed the Tranſport-office to pay him 500l. This ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſurpriſed him, as Meſſrs. Tarleton and Backhouſe had paid for the conveyance of about 60 of the troops in the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriffe Packet</hi> the ſum of 1500l. and at that rate the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the remaining 150 in the <hi>Enterprize</hi> would amount to 3750l. Mr. Soren, therefore, took the liberty of remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038531_0021_101250C07B751990"/>
with Mr. Long on the ſmallneſs of the ſum, when that gentleman aſſured him that was the whole that was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him, and intimated, that unleſs he accepted the ſum then offered, he had to expect nothing. The difficulties in which Mr. Soren had been involved, from the total ruin of his fortune, and the diſappointment of the very flattering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects he had reaſonably formed from the event of his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the diſtreſs he had ſuffered from the great length of time which had clapſed from the period when his ſhip was ſeized, and the dread that Mr. Long's intimation might be realized, induced him to accept the proffered ſum; and it ſeems he has but ſmall foundation to hope for any further compenſation for his loſs, and the injury he has ſuſtained, unleſs the preceding ſimple narrative of his caſe ſhould happen to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the eye of thoſe members of Adminiſtration who appear to have formed a juſt eſtimation of the groſs injuſtice of the capture, and the unparalleled circumſtances of wickedneſs and oppreſſion with which it was accompanied.</p>
            <p>The objection to Mr. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> claim of compenſation is, that he has let paſs the proper time for making that claim.— It is certainly true that a Court of Admiralty has the ſole and excluſive juriſdiction of the queſtion, "<hi>Prize or no prize?</hi>" and that, having cognizance of the <hi>principal</hi> queſtion, it has alſo the power, and the <hi>excluſive</hi> power, of awarding coſts and damages to the full extent, to the captured, where the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the caſe warrant ſuch a decree. It muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that a decree of reſtitution by no means implies that the captured are entitled, as a matter of courſe, to a decree of coſts and damages: there may have been <hi>probable</hi> grounds of ſeizure, though, on a full inveſtigation, the ſhip and cargo ſeized may be juſtly reſtored. It muſt alſo be admitted, that where the parties libelled, omit, in the proper ſtage of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, to pray for coſts and damages, the fair inference, in the firſt inſtance is, that they are ſatisfied their caſe does not entitle them to demand them: and it cannot be denied, that, in a legal point of view, Mr. St. Barbe was Mr. Soren's agent, though not ſpecially conſtituted ſuch; and that Mr. Soren was, in the ſame point of view, bound by his acts or omiſſions; but neither can it be denied, that a man may
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038531_0022_101250C21BBB9FE8"/>
ſuffer great injuſtice, and ſuſtain moſt grievous hardſhips, from the default of his agent, without being juſtly charged with the conſciouſneſs of the want of merit in his cauſe, and that he may, by accident or misfortune, or by the artful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his opponent, be completely ſhut out from <hi>legal</hi> redreſs, without forfeiting his claim to compenſation from that Government, by the nefarious acts of whoſe <hi>ſervant</hi> he has been reduced to ruin.</p>
            <p>This is <hi>peculiarly</hi> the caſe of Mr. Soren: he exerciſed an act of the moſt benevolent nature towards a ſhip in diſtreſs, in the danger of every moment going to the bottom of the ocean; this ſhip, and its commander, were in the <hi>ſervice</hi> of the Government of Great Britain: he received a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful requital; his ſhip and cargo were ſeized as prize, without the moſt diſtant ſhadow of a cauſe; he was cruelly put in a ſituation which prevented him, but under the moſt mortifying circumſtances, from following his property to the place where he might in perſon have claimed the protection and juſtice of the proper juriſdiction. There does not even ſeem to have been any cenſurable default in his agent. Mr. St. Barbe did, in fact, in the proper ſtage of the proceeding, petition for coſts and damages; this was rendered nugatory by the management of Potter, who procured the ſhip and cargo to be libelled as a droit of Admiralty at the ſuit of the King's advocate, on the very day when his petition was to be taken into conſideration. Before the ſecond libel could be diſpoſed of, Potter, againſt whom alone the decree of coſts and damages could be pronounced, abſconded, leaving no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty againſt which ſuch a decree could attach: the King's Advocate pays no coſts or damages: in the preſent caſe he acted merely in an official capacity, on the ſuggeſtion of Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: it is therefore to be attributed to accident, or at the moſt an excuſable want of foreſight on the part of Mr. St Barbe or his adviſers, or to the guilty management of Potter, that the proper time for demanding legal redreſs has paſſed.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Enterpriſe</hi> been captured by a perſon armed with a mere letter of marque, or even by a King's ſhip in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of warfare on the ſeas, without the circumſtance of her having fallen into the ſnare by an act of benevolence
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038531_0023_101250C497643860"/>
on the part of her commander and ſupercargo; though there had been no <hi>colour</hi> for the capture, though there had been no circumſtance of ſuſpicion to <hi>juſtify</hi> the capture, though there had been a decree of reſtitution on the fulleſt and cleareſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that ſhe was not a fit ſubject of ſeizure, though it muſt have been manifeſt to all the world, that if a petition for coſts and damages had been preferred, it muſt have been decreed; yet if the parties intereſted had, in the proper ſtage of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, through ignorance, or accident, or ill advice, or any other cauſe, omitted to claim thoſe coſts and damages, it is not contended that there would have been any moral obligation on the Government, under the ſanction of whoſe flag the injury had been committed, to refund the injured party the loſs he had ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>In the preſent caſe, it is not contended that Government were bound, by any rule of ſtrict moral obligation, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate Mr. Soren for any diſappointment in his expectation of <hi>ſpeculative</hi> gain on the event of his voyage; but, on an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive peruſal of his caſe, it is hardly to be ſuppoſed that the impartial reader will think it unreaſonable or too ſanguine in him to have hoped that he would have been reimburſed the difference between the prime coſt of his cargo and the produce of the remains which eſcaped the hands of his plundering captor, together with the full freight for the troops conveyed in his ſhip from Teneriffe to Barbadoes. His right to the <hi>latter</hi> can hardly be diſputed on ſtrict <hi>legal</hi> principles; though, perhaps, he might not be able, in any form of action, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover againſt the Commiſſioners of Tranſports, becauſe he had no contract with them. This right muſt indeed be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as acknowledged by thoſe who ordered the payment of the 500<hi>l.</hi>; for it ſeems to have been ordered, not as an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of generoſity in compaſſion to the hardſhips of his caſe, but as an equivalent for the freight of the troops: it was, in fact, by no means an equivalent according to the uſual rate in ſuch caſes. By what hidden influence ſo ſmall a ſum was ordered, it is difficult to conjecture: it is manifeſt, from the letters of Lord Grenville and Mr. Dundas, that it was the wiſh of both thoſe miniſters that Mr. Soren ſhould have an ample compenſation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:038531_0024_101250C70760F250"/>The contraſt between Mr. Soren's preſent ſituation, and what it might have been, had he been fortunate enough not to have fallen in with the <hi>Iſabella,</hi> is moſt diſtreſſing. From Hamburgh he failed with a cargo, the prime coſt of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded 3000<hi>l.</hi>: it conſiſted of articles which would have been of high value in the place to which they were deſtined; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits would have been large; the produce was to have been laid out in the purchaſe of an article which might probably have been ſold at Hamburgh at double the original price; and to this was to be added the profit ariſing from ſo much more of the ſame article as could have been purchaſed at Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinam for 15,000<hi>l.</hi>; for to that extent Mr. Soren had letters of credit on that place: the whole profits of his voyage muſt have placed him in a ſtate of enviable independence. He is now ſtripped of every thing; he has waſted four years of the prime of life in fruitleſs ſolicitation; he has again to begin his career of induſtry, with a wife and three infant children, without the aid of capital, though not perhaps without friends. His caſe is reſpectfully ſubmitted to the attentive peruſal of the Public, but more particularly of thoſe whoſe ſituation in life, or the ſituation of whoſe friends and relatives, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly expoſe them to the ſame kind of diſtreſs which he has experienced.</p>

                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:038531_0026_101250CC9E924758"/>1ſt, Captain Wyatt St. Barbe is obliged to proceed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thirty days, from hence, either in ballaſtor with permitted goods, to Surinam, and there to let and deliver his ſaid ſhip tight and ſtaunch, well caulked, tackled, apparelled, manned, and provided with every thing elſe neceſſary for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſaid loading and voyage, as alſo with the proper ſhip's papers, to the ſole uſe and free diſpoſition of the freighters, (the proper place for putting in the ſails, cables and proviſions, as alſo the neceſſary room for the crew, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, as being for the ſhip's uſe,) he not being permitted to load any goods or merchandizes for whomſoever, without the conſent of the freighters, on pain of forfeiting the freight-money agreed upon for ſuch goods, except three tons per hundred, which the captain may have on board for his own account, according to the cuſtom of America.</p>
               <p n="2">2d, The freighter's promiſe to cauſe to be ſhipped on board the ſaid veſſel, on her ſafe arrival at Surinam afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, a full convenient cargo of Weſt Indian products; but the captain is allowed three tons per hundred, as he is privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged according to the cuſtom of America; with which cargo the captain, as ſoon as he ſhall be diſpatched by the ſhippers, is to depart immediately, wind and weather permitting it, and to proceed on his voyage directly to this port of Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</p>
               <p n="3">3d, On the ſhip's ſafe arrival at the unloading place, and the captain having well and faithfully delivered the cargo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bills of lading by him ſigned, (ſave that he ſhall not be anſwerable for the riſks and damages of the ſea,) the freighters are obliged to cauſe to be paid unto the ſaid captain, or to his order, exactly, and without exception, his freight-money, ſtipulated at the rate of two thouſand ſix hundred pounds ſterling, good and lawful money of Great Britain, with fifteen per cent. primage for the whole ſhip's hold, and the performance of both voyages. On account of which freight, the captain is to be furniſhed at Surinam with what money he may be in need of, the extraordinary average which
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038531_0027_101250D0261ECA00"/>
might happen on this intended voyage being to be regulated and paid according to the cuſtom of the ſea.</p>
               <p n="4">4th, For loading at Surinam, forty running days, and for delivering here, thirty running days, in all, are agreed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Surinam aforeſaid as ſoon as the captain ſhall have advertiſed the ſhipper of his ſhip's being ready to receive the cargo on board, and continuing here the day after the ſaid ſhip's being reported at the Cuſtomhouſe, and the captain's having informed the conſignees of the cargo of his being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to deliver the ſame. If detained longer, the freighters are to pay him ſix pounds lawful Britiſh ſterling money de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrage, for every day ſo detained, day by day, as it becomes due.</p>
               <p n="5">5th, The freighters cauſe the cargo to be ſhipped on board, and ſo likewiſe landed, free of any expences to the captain, provided his ſhip be moored at proper places, ſo as the depth of the water will permit it; but the captain is obliged to aſſiſt with his boats and people in taking in the cargo at Surinam aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="6">6th, The Cuſtom-houſe duties for the cargo ſhall be cleared by the freighters, and thoſe for the ſhip by the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7th, In caſe the ſhip ſhould happen to be loſt on her homeward paſſage, which God forbid, the freighters are bound to pay for the outward voyage to Mr. St. Barbe, or Meſſrs. Pariſh and Co. his correſpondents here, one thouſand two hundred pounds ſterling, good and lawful money of Great Britain, with fifteen per cent. primage, after deducting the money which the captain may have received at Surinam as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And for the true performance of all and ſingular the above covenants and agreements, the ſaid parties do hereby mutually bind themſelves, eſpecially the freighters engaging the ſaid

               <head>No. IV. Letter from <hi>PETER FAVENC,</hi> Conſul-General for the Canary Iſlands, to <hi>CHARLES LONG,</hi> Eſq.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>The motive of troubling you with this letter is at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Mr. Soren, relative to a tranſaction that took place in the year 1796. In the month of March, in the ſaid year, arrived in Santa Cruz, in the iſland of Teneriffe, an Engliſh veſſel, commanded by a man of the name of Charles Potter; ſhe was from Cork, with troops on board, bound to the iſland of Barbadoes. On her arrival, through the channel of one of my agents, the ſaid Potter applied to me for my advice and aſſiſtance, as his veſſel was very leaky, and totally unfit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on her voyage; indeed, by his own confeſſion, had he not had the good fortune to fall in with the American ſhip, the Enterprize, bound from Hamburgh to the iſland of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marara, he would, in all probability, never have reached Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriffe, or any other port. Happening at that period to be in the iſland of Grand Canary, with ſome friends, I immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came over to aid him in the beſt manner I was able. He ſtated to me the ſervice Captain St. Barbe and Mr. Soren had rendered him, in bearing down when he hoiſted ſignals of diſtreſs; but, waving the gratitude he ſhould have felt for what in all probability was the preſervation of his life, and of thoſe entruſted to his care, he proclaimed the American ſhip a lawful prize, having naval ſtores on board, and being bound to an enemy's port: Of this I had great doubt, from the documents he produced; and from the event I am juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. He was preſſing with me to condemn her; but this I could not, it not laying ſolely in my breaſt—I adviſed him carrying her down to ſome iſland where there was a regular Court of Admiralty eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>His own veſſel, the Iſabella, having been condemned and ſold, it was neceſſary for him, the ſaid Potter, to deviſe ſome plan for the conveying theſe troops to their deſtination. As
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038531_0032_101250DB5C7E8E40"/>
many as he could, he put on board the Enterpriſe; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freighted a brig called the Teneriffe Packet, he in theſe two veſſels conveyed the troops, which all arrived ſafe, and without the leaſt accident. In regard to Potter's conduct, I think it was totally unjuſtifiable, with reſpect to Mr. Soren, Captain St. Barbe, and the proprietors of the goods on board the Enterpriſe, he having acted towards them with the greateſt ingratitude; and not having it in his power to make them the proper retribution, I think, from the ſervice the country has received in theſe troops being ſo ſoon forwarded to Barbadoes, to which place much time would have elapſed before their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, had the Enterpriſe not been ſeized upon in the very cruel manner ſhe was, ſome adequate compenſation for the loſs ſuſtained by the parties intereſted ought to be made: but this it does not become me to point out; to ſuperior judgment I leave that.</p>
               <p>If it would not be inconvenient to you, Sir, or intruding too much on your time, I ſhould feel myſelf honoured in half an hour's converſation with you on the ſubject of Meſſrs. Tarleton and Backhouſe, of Liverpool, whoſe conduct, in ſome part of this tranſaction, I think, ſhould be condemned.</p>

               <opener>To the <hi>KING'S</hi> Moſt Excellent Majeſty in Council, The Humble Petition of <hi>JOHN SOREN,</hi> of Boſton, in North America, merchant, partner in the houſe of Holyoke and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, of Boſton aforeſaid, and <hi>WYATT ST. BARBE,</hi> captain of the American ſhip Enterpriſe, belonging to Clough, of Witchcaſſet, Maſſachuſets, in North America aforeſaid, SHEWETH,</opener>
               <p>That your petitioners entered into a charter-party, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together, bearing date at Hamburgh the 24th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1795, whereby it was agreed that your Petitioner, Captain Wyatt St. Barbe, ſhould proceed from Hamburgh aforeſaid, with the ſaid ſhip, either in ballaſt or permitted goods, to Surinam; and your Petitioner, John Soren, agreed to ſhip on board the ſaid veſſel, at Surinam aforeſaid, a full cargo of Weſt India products, on the terms therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioner, John Soren, ſhipped a cargo on the ſaid veſſel, conſiſting of linen, cheeſe, bacon, and other goods, which he purchaſed at Hamburgh, for the ſum of 3204<hi>l.</hi> 3<hi>s.</hi> 4<hi>d.</hi> of ſterling money of Great Britain; and your petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, Wyatt St. Barbe, alſo ſhipped a quantity of linen, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries, liquors, and glaſs, on account of himſelf and Meſſrs. Furſt and Co. citizens and burghers of Hamburgh, to the value of 901<hi>l.</hi> 8<hi>s.</hi> 11<hi>d.</hi> of like ſterling money.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioners ſet ſail in the ſaid ſhip, on the 5th day of February 1796, from Hamburgh, to Surinam, there to diſpoſe of their ſaid cargo; and your Petitioner, John So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, alſo intended to take in another cargo of coffee at Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, upon his own account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:038531_0038_101250E88AEDDA00"/>That your Petitioners, on the 25th day of February 1796, the ſaid ſhip Enterpriſe being in latitude 44° 1′ N. and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude 18° 35′ W. on her ſaid voyage, diſcovered a ſhip with an Engliſh enſign reverſed, hoiſted as a ſignal of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs: Your Petitioners, therefore, immediately made ſail for her, and came up with and ſpoke her, and found her to be a Britiſh veſſel, called the Iſabella letter of marque, belonging to Meſſrs. Tarleton and Backhouſe, of the port of Liverpool commanded by Captain Charles Potter, and chartered as a tranſport-ſhip by the Britiſh Government, and was then on a voyage from Cork to the iſland of Barbadoes, with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of your Majeſty's troops on board. Your Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners found her in a very leaky and diſabled condition, and in great diſtreſs and danger, and both pumps going inceſſantly. Captain Potter, of the Iſabella, came on board your Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's veſſel, and, after repreſenting to your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, the extreme perilous ſituation of his ſhip and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, entreated your ſaid Petitioner to accompany him, and ſee him ſafe into Liſbon or Corunna; in anſwer to which, your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, obſerved, that having freighted his own ſhip, the Enterpriſe, for Surinam, his going with her to Liſbon or Corunna would be ſo great a deviation from his own voyage, that it would be thereby deſtroyed; but that, on account of the very diſtreſſed ſituation of the Iſabella and her crew, he would accompany them to Madeira, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriffe, or any of the Windward Iſlands, and would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the officers and as many of your Majeſty's troops as he could in his own veſſel, and would alſo render every other aſſiſtance in his power. To all which your Petitioner John Soren alſo moſt readily gave his conſent.</p>
               <p>That Captain Potter appeared to your Petitioners to be very well pleaſed and ſatisfied with the humane offer of your Petitioners, and ſaid he would immediately ſend on board his own veſſel for the approbation of the colonel and other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of your Majeſty's troops. He accordingly ſent his own mate, who had come on board your Petitioner's ſhip along with him, to his own veſſel, in order to communicate, as your
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:038531_0039_101250EAF23CD318"/>
Petitioners underſtood, the very obliging offer made by your Petitioners, as before-mentioned: but, inſtead of this, with an ingratitude and treachery ſcarcely to be paralleled, he deſired his mate to bring along with him a party of the ſhip Iſabella's armed force, for the purpoſe of capturing your Petitioner's ſaid ſhip, the Enterpriſe, notwithſtanding ſhe belonged to, and was freighted and commanded by, the citizens of the United States of America, a country at peace with your Majeſty, had nothing but neutral goods on board, purchaſed at Hamburgh for ſale at Surinam aforeſaid, notwithſtanding the offers made by your Petitioners to Captain Potter, to ſee the Iſabella and her company ſafe at Madeira or Teneriffe, or any of the Windward Iſlands, as aforeſaid, and notwithſtanding your Petitioners had ſailed a conſiderable way out of their own track for the purpoſe of ſaving the ſaid ſhip Iſabella from being loſt, which in all probability would have happened but for the timely interference of your Petitioners.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid mate returned with a party of armed ſoldiers and ſailors from the Iſabella, and ſeized your Petitioner's ſaid ſhip and cargo as a prize, and made your Petitioners and the crew priſoners, and forced your Petitioner, John Soren, with the chief mate and crew, out of their own ſhip into a boat, and put them on board the Iſabella, though ſhe was ſtill in the moſt dangerous and diſtreſſed condition, as if for the very purpoſe of ſacrificing them to that fate from which your Petitioners had ſaved them.</p>
               <p>That when your Petitioner John Soren arrived on board the Iſabella, he ſtated the circumſtances to the officers of your Majeſty's troops on board, and they reprobated, in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt terms, the ſhocking and inhumane conduct of Captain Potter.</p>
               <p>That Captain Potter obliged your Petitioner Captain St. Barbe to give him up all his papers, and broke open ſeveral caſes and boxes, and took thereout part of the cargo, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he thought proper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:038531_0040_101250ECA5FE5568"/>That Captain Potter proceeded with both veſſels to St. Croix, Teneriffe, and then tranſhipt military ſtores and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage from the Iſabella (ſhe being entirely unfit for ſea ſervice, and accordingly condemned) to your Petitioner's ſhip, the Enterpriſe, and broke open ſome other packages, and ſtarted others, for the purpoſe of fitting up births for the accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the ſoldiers, who, to the number of 150, with wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, beſides the Iſabella's crew, were embarked on board the Enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>That during their ſtay at Teneriffe, your Petitioner, John Soren, frequently requeſted Captain Potter permiſſion to go on ſhore, that he might apply to the Britiſh Conſul there for an inveſtigation of Captain Potter's proceedings, which Captain Potter refuſed; and your Petitioner, John Soren, was detained a priſoner on board the Iſabella, until he was liberated by order of the Governor of the iſland—but he was not then permitted to carry on ſhore any of his private property.</p>
               <p>That Captain Potter ſailed from Teneriffe with your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners' ſaid ſhip, the Enterpriſe, and your Petitioner, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain St. Barbe, on board her, but leaving your Petitioner, John Soren, at Teneriffe; and your Petitioners' ſaid veſſel arrived in Carliſle-bay, Barbadoes, on the 16th day of April 1796.</p>
               <p>That during the voyage of the ſaid ſhip from Teneriffe to Barbadoes, Captain Potter endeavoured to ſeduce and corrupt the ſailors of the Enterpriſe, by giving them liquors, making them great promiſes, and otherwiſe, to induce them to ſwear that the ſhip and cargo were French and Dutch property; but finding ſuch attempts ineffectual, he put them upon a very ſcanty allowance of bread and water, by which the health of the ſeamen was greatly injured, particularly of the carpenter, who was likewiſe kept in chains.</p>
               <p>That upon the arrival of the ſhip Enterpriſe at Barbadoes, Captain Potter inſtituted a libel againſt her and the cargo, as
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:038531_0041_101250F0F5527F58"/>
a prize, in the Court of Vice-Admiralty in Barbadoes; to which a claim was entered by your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, on behalf of himſelf and the owners of the ſaid ſhip and cargo; and an order was made, on the application of your ſaid Petitioner, that Captain Potter ſhould give ſecurity for coſts, in caſe the ſaid ſhip ſhould not be condemned:— Potter did not give ſecurity as ordered, but abſconded; and the libel was diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>That, very ſoon afterwards, a libel was filed by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate-General againſt the ſhip and cargo, as a droit of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty; to which a claim was alſo put in by your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, on behalf of the ſhip's owners and the perſons intereſted in her cargo; and proceedings being had and examinations taken in the ſaid cauſe, the ſame was, on the 8th of September 1796, heard before the Hon. Jonathan Blenman, ſole Judge of the ſaid Court; and upon ſuch hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſaid libel was diſmiſſed, and the ſhip and cargo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and adjudged to be reſtored to your Petitioner, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain St. Barbe, as the claimant of the ſame.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioner, Captain St. Barbe, on the ſaid ſhip being delivered up to him, and ſuch part of the cargo as had not been taken out of the ſaid veſſel, during the time ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in poſſeſſion of the ſaid Captain Potter, ſold and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſuch remaining cargo, by auction, for the net ſum of 1756<hi>l.</hi> 9<hi>s.</hi> 9¾<hi>d.</hi>; which occaſions a loſs to your Petitioners of the ſum of 2349<hi>l.</hi> 12<hi>s.</hi> 6<hi>d.</hi> ſterling, upon the coſt price of the articles purchaſed at Hamburgh.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioners have annexed hereunto an account of the actual loſs ſuſtained by themſelves and the other owners of the ſaid ſhip and her cargo.</p>
               <p>That the owners of the Enterpriſe and her cargo, but for the detention aforeſaid, would have gained a conſiderable profit upon the ſale of the cargo at Surinam; and your Petitioner, John Soren, had likewiſe engaged, by the charter-party, to freight the ſaid veſſel with coffee, at Surinam, to the amount,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:038531_0042_101250F29DAAECC8"/>
in weight, of 600,000<hi>lb.</hi>; upon which, with other coffee he had intended to ſhip for Europe, a conſiderable profit would have ariſen.</p>
               <p>That the ſaid veſſel, during the time ſhe was in the hands of the ſaid Captain Potter, was robbed of great part of her tackling and apparel, and the worms had eat her bottom, and ſhe was otherwiſe ſo much damaged, that your Petitioner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily expended large ſums in repairing her.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioners did not apply to the Vice-Admiralty Court of Barbadoes for the payment of their ſaid damages and coſts, becauſe, before the diſmiſſal of the ſecond libel inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by your Majeſty's Advocate-General againſt the ſaid ſhip and cargo, Captain Potter had actually abſconded from the iſland of Barbadoes, and no damages or coſts, as your Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners are informed, are paid in proſecuting in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's name.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioners, ſince their arrival in England, have been adviſed by Sir William Scott and Mr. Gibbs, one of your Majeſty's counſel, that your Petitioners cannot obtain any redreſs or compenſation in any of the courts of law in this Kingdom, for the damages and coſts which they have ſuſtained by the premiſes, either from Meſſrs. Tarleton and Backhouſe, the owners of Captain Potter's veſſel, or from the ſaid Captain Potter, who hath abſconded.</p>
               <p>Your Petitioners, therefore, moſt humbly pray Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty will be graciouſly pleaſed to take the aforeſaid matters and things into your royal conſideration, and grant to your Petitioners ſuch relief as Your Majeſty in the exerciſe of your royal wiſdom and bounty ſhall think fit and expedient.</p>

               <p>I am honoured with your Lordſhip's letter, dated De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 29th, incloſing a copy of a note received from Mr. King, together with its incloſure, relative to the ſhip En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, and requeſting me to report to your Lordſhip my opinion on the merits of the caſe, as far as I might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thereupon. In obedience to your Lordſhip's requeſt, I have conſidered the ſame, and report to your Lordſhip, that I am no further acquainted with the merits of the caſe, than as they have appeared to me in a ſtatement of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which was ſubmitted to me on the part of the American owners for my opinion, and in the papers now tranſmitted to me by your Lordſhip—That, according to the repreſentations contained therein, the American owners have ſuſtained a very conſiderable loſs, in conſequence of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct of the privateer; but that the law had offered a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the injury, by giving them a demand for coſts and damages againſt Captain Potter, or, in caſe of his inſolvency, againſt his ſecurities, and againſt his owners, who were all anſwerable to the extent of the damages that might have been awarded againſt him—That this demand ought to have been made in the Vice-Admiralty Court, and was not in the leaſt degree precluded by the ſubſequent proceedings carried
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:038531_0045_101250FB0D4BD6D0"/>
on in his Majeſty's name againſt this ſhip and her cargo— That the American owners made no ſuch demand, and muſt therefore, in all <hi>legal</hi> conſideration, be preſumed to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in the juſtice of a ſimple reſtitution, without coſts and damages; and, by that acquieſcence they ſtand barred from the poſſibility of obtaining a <hi>legal</hi> relief, either in Courts of Admiralty or in courts of any other ſpecies. What other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief they are deſirous of obtaining in conſequence of their preſent application, they do not define in the prayer of their petition: but I muſt ſubmit generally, that if the courſe of law has applied an adequate remedy for injuries, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties entitled to it have for ſome reaſon or other declined to reſort to it, it cannot found any claim upon the juſtice of that government under which an injury of that ſpecies has been committed without being followed by its proper ſatisfaction.</p>

               <p>My diſagreeable ſituation in this country, ariſing from the circumſtance of having adminiſtered to the relief of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh ſhip Iſabella letter of marque, commanded by Captain Charles Potter, obliges me to apply to your Lordſhip for that redreſs and aſſiſtance the forms of law here deny me.</p>
               <p>I beg leave to bring to your Lordſhip's recollection an application made on my behalf as freighter of the American ſhip Enterpriſe, Captain Wyatt St. Barbe, by Mr. King, the American miniſter, to your Lordſhip. The anſwers I have had the honour to receive, have been wholly againſt any <hi>legal</hi> claim upon my part, by reaſon of non-application
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:038531_0046_101250FCA91C5E48"/>
for damages, upon the acquittal of the Enterpriſe, libelled by Captain Potter in the Vice-Admiralty Court at Barbadoes as a prize. The reaſons the Captain of the Enterpriſe aſſigns for ſuch non-application for damages are, that his counſel at Barbadoes adviſed him to apply for damages in England, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Potter had abſented himſelf from the iſland, and there was not any perſon within the juriſdiction of the Admiralty Court againſt whom damages could be awarded, and as the owners of the Iſabella, Meſſrs Tarleton and Backhouſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided at Liverpool, in England.</p>
               <p>I have procured the ſeveral opinions of Sir William Scott, Dr. Nicholls, and Mr. Gibbs, one of his Majeſty's counſel, who inform me no redreſs can be had by application either in the Admiralty or common law courts here. It falls, my Lord, hard indeed upon me. I ſhall, unleſs I have a claim upon the humanity and accuſtomed generoſity of the Britiſh Government, be utterly ruined—hard, my Lord, becauſe I had no opportunity hitherto of making any effectual application for redreſs. Having been left by Captain Potter at the iſland of Teneriffe, and wholly unable to proceed to Barbadoes, to proſecute my caſe in the Admiralty Court there in perſon, I proceeded to England, (all my property withheld from me, and conſequently with much inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience), to lay my caſe before the Britiſh Government. I have been in this country upwards of two years, ſolely upon this buſineſs; and I aſſure your Lordſhip, from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of being, by ſuch capture, ſtripped of the greateſt part of my property, that I have, during my reſidence here, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone much perſonal inconvenience.</p>
               <p>The Iſabella had on board near 300 troops for the Weſt Indies. Humanity, my Lord, induced me to relieve the ſhip, and by the aſſiſtance I rendered, the majority of thoſe perſons were conveyed in the Enterpriſe to the places of their deſtination. This, my Lord, Captain Potter would not deny, was he in this country. Some recompenſe I ſubmit, ſhould be made, for forcing me out of my ſhip at the point
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:038531_0047_1012299CCC0DF7D0"/>
of the bayonet, after having offered, to render any aſſiſtance in my power to Captain Potter; for ſending me on board the Iſabella in the miſerable condition ſhe was; but certainly, my Lord, for forcibly taking poſſeſſion of a neutral ſhip, and expending my property. I only aſk ſimilar humanity to be ſhewn towards me, for my preſervation, as I extended to the perſons on board the Iſabella; for I am at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without the proſpect of placing myſelf in a ſituation to enable me to provide for my ſupport. The Britiſh Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has in fact had the uſe of the Enterpriſe to forward the troops: I ſubmit, my Lord, whether ſome compenſation ought not to be awarded for my aſſiſtance in that reſpect. My voyage to Surinam for coffee is entirely loſt, and I have been unable to fulfil my mercantile engagements—Unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Barbadoes, I did, as I thought, and ſtill think, all in my power to ſeek redreſs, by ſailing for England to make application there. No one, my Lord, upon examination of my caſe, can doubt the hardſhip of it; and the only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to be alleged againſt my application is, that Captain St. Barbe (being adviſed by his counſel at Barbadoes) did not petition for damages there upon the acquittal of the ſhip, at which place I am now even ſhut out from applying for redreſs; nor was there a poſſibility of ever applying on my part. How hard your Lordſhip ſees theſe circumſtances are upon me. I humbly conceive the Britiſh Government has, in many caſes, aſſiſted perſons who do not ſtand in a ſituation to make legal demands, but whoſe claims are equitable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate. Such, my Lord, I apprehend is my caſe: and as I have hitherto had no opportunity of proſecuting my caſe in perſon, I have to requeſt ſuch aſſiſtance and redreſs, through your Lordſhip's means, as from the circumſtance of having relieved a Britiſh ſhip in diſtreſs, with his Majeſty's troops on board, which has brought me into my preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the equity of my caſe, and my diſtreſſed ſituation, demand.</p>

               <p>Soon after the receipt of your late letter, recapitulating the oppreſſive circumſtances of the capture of your veſſel and cargo, I ſent it encloſed in a note to the Treaſury, with a view of aſſiſting you in obtaining the difference between the ſum you had received, and that which had been earned by your veſſel, according to the uſual rate of compenſation in the tranſport ſervice; and I am ſorry to inform you that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which I have received affords me no reaſon to believe that this moderate demand will be ſatisfied. According to the legal opinions which you have taken, you can have no remedy in the ordinary courſe of juſtice, and the reſult of my applications convinces me that ſo far from obtaining from the Engliſh Government indemnity for your loſſes, it is not likely that you will receive the reſidue of the compenſation due for the uſe of your veſſel in the tranſportation of a number of the King's troops to the Weſt Indies. Under theſe circumſtances, I think it my duty to recommend to you to relinquiſh all farther ſolicitation, and to return home without delay.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I have peruſed the narrative relative to the conduct of Captain Potter, with reſpect to the American ſhip Enterpriſe, and find the ſtatement true and correct, to the time when that ſhip arrived at Barbadoes: In a few days afterwards I went with the regiment to which I belonged to St. Domingo.</p>
               <p>The attention of myſelf and brother officers to you and your ſhip's company, which you have mentioned in ſuch hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome terms, was no more than was due to people who had ſo humanely come to the relief of a ſhip in the miſerable and diſtreſſed condition in which the Iſabella tranſport then was; and I ſhould think it a want of juſtice and candour not to acknowledge in this public manner, the obligation I and thoſe under my command were under to you and Captain St. Barbe, for ſaving us in all probability from deſtruction.</p>
               <p>When Captain Potter inſiſted upon making prize of your ſhip, I interceded with him as much as in my power, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to him that he could not condemn her; and that even if he could, (<hi>even if ſhe belonged to our moſt inveterate enemy), yet, on account of the humane and generous manner in which you and Captain St. Barbe had behaved to us, ſhe ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</hi> Finding I could make no impreſſion on him by calm remonſtrances, I aſſumed a tone of authority, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted</hi> he ſhould: on which he produced to me a letter of marque, and declared that if I interpoſed in liberating his prize, I muſt be anſwerable to his owners.</p>
               <p>When at Teneriffe, I again urged him to diſcharge the Enterpriſe; at the ſame time informing him, that as there
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:038531_0050_101251066AE05568"/>
was no other ſhip to be had at the iſland, and as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ſituation of public affairs a rupture between Great Britain and Spain might be apprehended, in which caſe the troops under my command might be detained pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of war, I would take upon myſelf, with the conſent of you and Captain St. Barbe, to charter that ſhip in the name of Government, to carry as many of the detachment as ſhe could to Barbadoes. He peremptorily refuſed to relinquiſh her as prize: on which I told him I was much concerned at being obliged to be witneſs of his infamous conduct, and that I was certain his owners, as well as every other perſon in England who ſhould hear of the tranſaction, would highly condemn him.</p>
               <p>At Teneriffe I reported his conduct to Mr. Favene, the Britiſh Conſul there; and at Barbadoes to Admiral Sir John Laforey, commander in chief of his Majeſty's fleet at that iſland, and alſo to his Excellency Governor Ricketts, who all expreſſed their opinions, that his treatment of you and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain St. Barbe was cruel and oppreſſive in the extreme; and further, when at Barbadoes, I made an affidavit of the facts before a magiſtrate, in which I was joined by Captain Davis, and ſhould alſo have been joined by Captain Thomas, but he was prevented, being obliged to go on board a ſhip which was under way for St. Domingo.</p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I truſt it will be manifeſt to all who ſhall read the narrative of your ſufferings, that thoſe who had the beſt opportunity of obſervation, were perfectly ſatisfied of the iniquity of Captain Potter's conduct. As to myſelf, I ſhall ever retain the moſt grateful remembrance of the obligation I owe to you and Captain St. Barbe; and am, Sir,</p>

Captain Potter, commanding the Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, ſeized the American ſhip and took her into Teneriffe, on pretence of her having enemy's property on board. The Iſabella being then condemned, the Enterpriſe was fitted up as a tranſport, and in that capacity conveyed, to the beſt of my recollection, about 150 ſoldiers to Barbadoes.</p>
