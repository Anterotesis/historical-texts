            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have preſum'd, without Your Leave, to inſcribe to your Name the following DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COURSE, (for the Subſtance preached in Your Hearing, but now publiſh'd with ſome Enlargements &amp; Additions,) which I hope You will eaſily excuſe, when You conſider how naturally I was led into this Dedication. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Meanneſs of the <hi>Compoſure,</hi> yet (the <hi>Subject</hi> being ſo grateful to You) You were pleas'd to order it to the Preſs; herein imitating good <hi>Jacob,</hi> who erected a Monument on his beloved <hi>Rachel</hi>s Grave, as a Teſtimony of His Reſpect to Her, and to be a ſtanding Memorial of Her Life and Death. And it is <hi>in obedience to Your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> (as well as at the Requeſt of others, and (to
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002218_0005_0FDAC8E993E68F08"/>
ſpeak the Truth) in purſuance of my own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,) that this Sermon <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. And ſince It comes abroad under <hi>Your</hi> Patronage, I need not make any manner of <hi>Apology</hi> for expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to public View; altho' I imagine my ſelf not unfurniſht with ſufficient Excuſes both for Preaching and Printing on ſuch an Occaſion. It wou'd be <hi>Enough</hi> to ſay, I have <hi>good Example</hi> for it in many Inſtances, as well Ancient as Modern. Some Expoſitors (as one obſerves<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr. Mather's <hi>Ornaments for the Daughters of Zion.</hi> p. 6.7.</note>) judge, that the <hi>Deſcription of a Virtuous Woman,</hi> in the laſt Chapter of the Proverbs, is <hi>Solomon</hi>s Reciprocation in the praiſe of his incomparable Mother <hi>Bathſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah</hi>: having firſt recorded ſome of her wiſe Sayings and godly Counſils, (<hi>The Prophecy which his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught Him,</hi>) He proceeds, ('tis Thought,) in a grateful ſenſe of his Obligations to Her, and in Honour to her Memory, to draw her Character, and give an Encomium of Her, which wou'd <hi>remain</hi> on durable Record, after the moſt laſting Marble Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſhou'd be crumbl'd into Duſt. And You may have read how <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> have celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Their <hi>Mothers</hi> Names, and handed them down to Poſterity with great Honour. You may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo that the noble <hi>Romans</hi> of old have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beſtow'd the Reſpect of a <hi>Funeral Oration</hi> on Their virtuous <hi>Mothers</hi>; &amp; this under the favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Umbrage of the <hi>Public Authority,</hi> which decree'd ſuch Honour to Them. And many worthy Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>freſher Date</hi> (and ſome among our ſelves) might be produced; as well as <hi>other Arguments</hi> offer'd in Juſtification of what I have done to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002218_0006_0FDAD05FD42370F8"/>
a little towards <hi>embalming</hi> the Name of my ever honour'd and truly memorable Mother. But <hi>the Thing carries it's own Vindication</hi>: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a juſt Tribute to her known Deſerts; a proper Expreſſion of Filial Duty; An Acknowlegement due to our aſcended LORD, who has given ſuch Grace, and ſo many Excellencies to a frail Woman; and a Service to the Church of CHRIST, as it may provoke a laudable Imitation in others, to conſider the Account that is given (thô very imperfectly) of her holy Life &amp; Death; in both which She was ſo conſpicuous &amp; eminent a Pattern, whereby, <hi>tho' dead, She ſpeaks</hi> to the Inſtruction of Survivors.</p>
            <p>HER <hi>Memory,</hi> I know, SIR, <hi>needs not</hi> the Help of <hi>my Sermon,</hi> or any Thing elſe, to make it Perpetual with <hi>You.</hi> Her <hi>Perſon</hi> &amp; <hi>Character</hi> were too <hi>pretious</hi> to You to be eaſily forgotten; and your <hi>Thoughts too deeply impreſt</hi> by her <hi>Death,</hi> to ſuffer the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Reſentments of your afflictive Loſs to deſert You ſoon. You knew her Worth too well, and will feel your Want of Her too much, ever to need a <hi>Remembrancer.</hi> And thô I am abundantly ſenſible of the Greatneſs of your Loſs and the Deepneſs of your Wound; yet my <hi>Relation</hi> has made Me as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to offer any Lines of <hi>Comfort</hi> or Words of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi> to You on this ſad Occaſion. <hi>Your own Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> can furniſh You with ſufficient Matter both of <hi>Conſolation</hi> &amp; <hi>Direction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SIR, I can't but take a juſt Opportunity here to ſay, What Reaſon We have to adore the Divine Goodneſs in <hi>Prolonging</hi> to Us the Enjoyment of ſo valuable a Parent: and what a <hi>double</hi> Satisfaction 'tis to Me, that while I am dropping my Tributary Tears over a <hi>Deceaſed Mother,</hi> I can by this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002218_0007_0FDAD03ED2D86AC8"/>
make my public Acknowlegements to a <hi>living Father</hi>; who was by unweary'd Kindneſs, and great Care in our Education, laid us under all poſſible Bones of Love &amp; Gratitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MAY GOD ſtill lengthen out your Life,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore &amp; confirm your Health, comfort you and help you ſtill to glorify Him in all your Tribulation, increaſe your Uſefulneſs in the Poſt of Honour and publick Service you ſuſtain, and take you ſafe (thô <hi>late</hi>) to the Place of perfect Purity, Peace and Joy; whither our dear Mother (who was ſo much the Staff of your Hands, as well as the Deſire of your Eyes) is gone before you!</p>
            <p>MAY the SPIRIT of Grace make Us (and our Children) Ornaments to your Name, and Heirs of Your &amp; Her Wiſdom, Faith, Holineſs, and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: that ſo We may all at laſt Meet again at the right Hand of CHRIST, and ſpend a bleſſed Eternity together in our Maſters Joy! And now I pray GOD bleſs the <hi>following Papers,</hi> devoted to His Glory, the Honour of the Dead, and the Uſe of the Living; and make them ſerviceable to the good Ends, for which They are ſincerely deſign'd by</p>

            <p>DIVINE PROVIDENCE hath ſeen meet within a little while to take away by Death <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mrs. <hi>Brattle,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Leverett,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> &amp;c.</note> ſeveral <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in Iſrael,</hi> (who have ſome of their Relations in this Place) <hi>Devout &amp; Honourable Women,</hi> whoſe Memory is bleſſed; And we cannot but be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly touch'd with the <hi>repeated</hi> Stroke in the Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of <hi>Another</hi> the laſt Week, that was alſo valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all and nearly related to Many of us here

preſent. Truly <hi>the Blow is heavy, and the Breach wide.</hi> And to be affected with ſo ſolemn a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as the Departure of Perſons of Name and Worth, of Piety and Serviceableneſs, Is what every common <hi>Neighbour</hi> is under civil and chriſtian Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to. This is what the <hi>ſpecial Friends</hi> and Acquaintants of the Deceaſed, who have a nearer Concern in the Loſs, are more peculiarly oblig'd to. — But the <hi>Relatives</hi> are under natural and the ſtrongeſt Bonds to Mourn the Death of Pious and Uſeful Perſons ——. That I might more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſuit my Diſcourſe to the Caſe of Relatives in Mourning; eſpecially of Children for the Loſs of a gracious Mother, which is the melancholy Caſe of not a Few in this Audience, (and may be ſo of Others e're long) I have therefore choſen the Words before Us for the Subject of our preſent Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; — <hi>I bowed down heavily, as One that mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth for his Mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Perſon here ſpeaking is holy <hi>David,</hi> the Royal Pſalmiſt of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> He makes a Proteſtation of his cordial Love towards and tender Sympathy with his Enemies and Perſecutors under their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. They <hi>rejoyced</hi> indeed in his <hi>Adverſity</hi>: but he <hi>mourned</hi> in their's. If they were viſited with <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> he <hi>Sympathized with them,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd it towards them with the greateſt Compaſſion and the kindeſt Uſage: If they were remov'd by <hi>Death,</hi> He <hi>Mourned for them,</hi> bowing down his head in great heavineſs, and condoling the Loſs, as tho' there had been an intimate <hi>Friendſhip</hi> or near <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> between them: Yea, his Grief at their Death did bear ſome Proportion and Similitude to the Sorrow of dutiful Children, bereaved of a dear
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002218_0010_0FDAD062D2CDF318"/>
and deſirable <hi>Mother</hi>; ſuch an One as <hi>David's</hi> own was, and whom perhaps he may now refer to more immediately. At their Death, he took on, as for the Loſs of his own Mother, a gracious &amp; tender Mother. This diſcovers the Pſalmiſt to be one of an excellent Spirit, &amp; a truly extraordinary Compaſſion; a Man made up of Pity and Benevolence, and acted by the ſuperior Principles of Religion. He has ſet us an Example of uncommon Humanity, and Charity; which challenges Conſideration and Imitation. But I ſhall not inſiſt here. — I deſign to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice only of the <hi>Alluſion</hi> or incidental Hint in our Text,— of <hi>One's Mourning for his Mother,</hi>—which intimates the Lawfulneſs, and Decency, yea and Duty of lamenting the Death of near Relations, and particularly of a dear and good Mother.</p>
            <p>AND this is the Point of Doctrine now (as GOD ſhall help) to be diſcourſed upon:
<q>IT is Lawful, yea Proper, and a Duty to m<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap> the Death if near Relations, and particula<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> of a tender and religious Mother.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE Deceaſe of ſuch is a juſt Matter and Motive of Lamentation. Our neareſt &amp; deareſt Relatives muſt die and go to the Houſe appointed for all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. <hi>Father</hi> &amp; <hi>Mother</hi> muſt be ſeparated from us by <hi>Their</hi> or <hi>Our</hi> Death. The ſtrongeſt Ties of Nature or Affection can't continue our Union together in this World, when Death comes to diſſolve the ſame. And the Parting with lov'd Relations, is a proper Occaſion of Grief. Their Death is a very Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Thing, and to be laid to Heart. The Removal of a tender Parent, of a delightful Child, of a loving
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002218_0011_0FDAD041D6BBA420"/>
Brother or Siſter, or any affectionate and beloved Relative whatſoever, is a <hi>Mournful</hi> Diſpenſation, and to be ſeriouſly reſented and ſuitably improved. But I ſhall confine my ſelf to ſpeak particularly of the Death of a pious &amp; dear <hi>Mother.</hi> The Death of ſuch an One calls for peculiar Accents of Grief. <hi>This is a Lamentation, &amp; ſhall be for a Lamentation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE we may conſider briefly ſome of the Grounds &amp; Reaſons, that warrant &amp; require Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren's Mourning on ſuch an Occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particulars may ſuffice.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THE Death of a tender and gracious Mother infers the Loſs of a great &amp; comprehenſive Bleſſing; and therefore is a deplorable Evil.</hi> The proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Grief is a preſent afflictive Evil, whether <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>cious Mother, (whom to enjoy is one of the chief Felicities of this lower World,) muſt needs be accounted a moſt proper Subject of deep La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A wiſe and good Mother is a very valuable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.</hi> Her Uſefulneſs is extenſive, Her Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing Good conſiderable, and her Life is therefore pretious.</p>
            <p>OUR wiſe and virtuous Mothers are no little <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments</hi> to the Places where they dwell; Theſe Daughters of Zion are none of the leaſt of Zion's Glories, They are ſome of the Excellent in the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when Death tranſlates theſe ſhining Lights, it caſts a gloomy Shade on the Town, and Family; it thins the Glory, and caſts down the Beauty of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:002218_0012_0FDAD06452DFC980"/>AGAIN, Our Pious Mothers are a <hi>Defenſe</hi> (as well as Honour) to the reſpective Places of their abode: And the Town and Family, from which they are remov'd, are <hi>weaken'd</hi> by their Fall, in proportion to the Degree of their Piety, Wiſdom, and Influence. <hi>Devout Women</hi> are many times (in conjunction with others) inſtrumental to the <hi>Protection</hi> of a Family or People from deſolating Judgments. They contribute to the <hi>Safety</hi> of a Houſe or Place, ſometimes by their prudent <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,</hi> ſometimes by their importunate <hi>Prayers</hi>; yea ſometimes by their very <hi>Preſence</hi>: The Preſence of theſe holy, humble Ones, to whom the gracious GOD hath a ſpecial Reſpect, is often a Remora to the Execution of Divine Threatnings on Others, who are ripe for the Indignation of the LORD. <hi>For their Sakes</hi> GOD doth many times mercifully ſuſpend deſerved Judgments, or moderate His Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Diſpenſations. —And therefore the Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of theſe pious, praying Perſons ſhou'd affect and grieve the Living. The taking away of ſuch is as a <hi>pulling down the Pillars</hi> of an Houſe, or a <hi>plucking up the Stakes</hi> out of an Hedge. When ſuch die, ſo much of the Strength fails, and of the Defenſe is gone.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, They are more <hi>Poſitive</hi> and <hi>Active Bleſſings</hi>; and are not only the Means of keeping out hurtful Evils, but alſo of bringing in many real and deſirable Benefits. They are many ways uſeful by their Gifts and Graces, by their Prayers, their Example, their Advices, Reproofs, Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c. The whole Houſe fares the better for the wiſe and good Mother, in all it's Intereſts.</hi> The Health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Eſtate, Reputation, good Order,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002218_0013_0FDAD043539AD450"/>
Virtue and Religion of the Family, and Place, are all greatly ſubſerved by Her. — When therefore our gracious Mothers die, the <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Family,</hi> (which have enjoy'd their Preſence) are ſo much <hi>Impoveriſh'd,</hi> and the common Treaſure ſunk. So much of the principal ſtock is drawn out of the Bank. In that Houſe, where the godly Mother ceaſes, <hi>The Meaſure of Gifts and Graces, and the Number of Prayers &amp; Services are leſſend</hi>; which is as the letting out of ſo much vital Blood and Spirits, whereupon Sickneſs and Weakneſs of the Body enſues.</p>
            <p>SURELY then we ought to lament the Death of our honoured and pious Mothers with a very pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Sorrow. We ought to bewail it on the Account of the <hi>general Loſs,</hi> which the whole Family and Town ſuſtains.</p>
            <p>AND We ſhou'd <hi>every One</hi> bewail his own <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> Loſs therein. We ſhou'd ſadly lay to heart our own <hi>particular Concern</hi> in the common Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reavement. We [the Children] are ſome of the greateſt Loſers. When our pious and wiſe and careful Mothers are taken away, <hi>Who can ſay how many Bleſſings we are depriv'd of</hi> by this one awful Blow? It infers a mighty Change, a dreadful Breach on our Comforts, and often a ſad Increaſe of our Cares. Tho' when we enjoy'd them, we did not ſufficiently value and improve them; yet when they are gone, we ſoon find a lamentable Miſs of them. <hi>What a Melancholy Vacancy does their Removal make</hi>? When they die, We loſe the <hi>Sight of them,</hi> which was ſo much the Deſire of our Eyes. We loſe their <hi>Wiſdom, Abilities</hi> &amp; <hi>Graces,</hi> which render'd them ſuch Delights and Helps unto us.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002218_0014_0FDAD06624A950A0"/>
We loſe their <hi>profitable Converſation,</hi> &amp; can no more take ſweet Counſel together with them. We want their wiſe Advices, their faithful Admonitions, their holy Examples, their devout Prayers, and Labours of Love. We can no more enjoy any kind Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences from them of any ſort. Death puts a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to all their good Offices. <hi>Their works follow them,</hi>— in this ſenſe.</p>
            <p>A great and ſore Loſs then do the Poſterity of gracious Women receive in their Death. And this Reflection beſpeaks a very ſenſible Grief on ſo ſad an Occaſion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>THE Death of an uſeful gracious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is commonly a Rebuke on her Surviving Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for their Sin.</hi> Conſider'd as a <hi>Natural,</hi> and much more as a <hi>Penal</hi> Evil, this Loſs is greatly to be lamented. There is many times much of the <hi>Wrath of GOD</hi> mixed with this Affliction: And the Conſideration of this may well <hi>put an Edge</hi> on our Reſentments &amp; <hi>add Weight</hi> to our Grief. Such a Bereavement is often a ſtroke of Vindictive Juſtice. The Sin of the Children ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames the Wrath of GOD, and procures the Death of their Mother. They are vile and wicked, and not worthy of Her; or are full of guilty Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with reference unto her. If we <hi>over-rate,</hi> and <hi>over-love</hi> our valuable Parents, if we place all our Dependence on and Delight in them; if we make the Enjoyment of them the great Solace of our Lives, and build our Hopes of future Comfort too much on their Continuance, and are loth to leave them at the Divine Diſpoſe: If we <hi>idolize</hi> them, and give 'em that Seat in our Hearts, which
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002218_0015_0FDAD044D1960788"/>
only belongs to GOD our ſovereign Ruler and only ſufficient Portion, and do not deſire &amp; rejoyce in his Preſence and Favour as we ought to do; <hi>This</hi> may juſtly <hi>provoke</hi> Him to <hi>ſeparate</hi> from us the beloved Object. GOD is jealous of His own Rights, He will not admit any Rival or divide His Glory with another: If He obſerves Parent or Child lie too near our Hearts, and take up too much Room in our Breaſts, whereby He is ſhut out from thoſe Regards which are due unto Him, <hi>no Marvel if He make a Breach,</hi> to teſtify His Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure —. And on the other hand, if a gracious Parent be <hi>neglected,</hi> undervalued, and ſet at nought, This is greatly <hi>provoking</hi> to GOD; and no Wonder, if He ſo reſent the Sin, as to puniſh the Guilty with a Bereavement of their deſpis'd and abuſed Privilege —. Alas! how <hi>prone</hi> are we to be baſely unthankful for our good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, eſpecially our pious Mothers, while they are ſpared to us? And how apt to ſlight the many Advantages that we enjoy or are capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by them? How <hi>diſobedient,</hi> or <hi>unkind,</hi> or <hi>negligent</hi> are we prone to be in our Carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them? — <hi>And now, it may be for ſome ſuch Miſcarriages as theſe, that GOD is viſiting of us.</hi> He takes away our <hi>over-valu'd</hi> Parent, in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at and in Teſtimony againſt our Idolatry. Or He bereaves us of the <hi>contemned</hi> Bleſſing, to puniſh our criminal Ingratitude, &amp; Undutifulneſs: He will make us to know the worth of it by ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Want of it.</p>
            <p>THUS the Death of a wiſe and good Mother is ſometimes a <hi>Puniſhment of Sin</hi> and a Fruit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging Wrath, in a <hi>ſpecial</hi> manner. And in this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002218_0016_0FDAD06752E63DD8"/>
Diſpenſation indeed there is <hi>ordinarily</hi> a <hi>Mixture</hi> of holy Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND is not this a Mournful Conſideration</hi>? Shou'd not this Thought make our Hearts bleed, and our Eyes flow with Tears of Sorrow? Verily it is <hi>our Sin,</hi> that is the <hi>Sting</hi> in every Affliction: and <hi>GOD's Wrath</hi> which is the <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> in every Cup. The <hi>Divine-Judgment</hi> is the Gall &amp; Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in our Adverſities, the great <hi>Aggravation</hi> of our Sorrows: and our Eye may well be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med becauſe of Grief, when GOD is chaſtening Us in His hot Diſpleaſure, Truly it well becomes the moſt unbroken and heroic Minds to melt into ſoft and tender Paſſions, to relent and ſigh under the Tokens of Divine Anger, and at the Remembrance of Sin, which pulls down the Wrath of GOD on our guilty Heads —. An awful Regard then to the Hand of Divine Juſtice in taking away a pious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhou'd influence Us to mourn ſuch a Death. The Frown &amp; Rebuke of Providence herein ſhou'd awaken a moſt afflictive ſenſe of Her Removal.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>GOD allow, expects, and requires, that We mourn on this Occaſion.</hi> GOD has formed our Nature ſo as that We are capable of being mov'd with different Paſſions and Affections, according to the Variety of Objects that occur, whether good or evil, preſent or abſent. And while ſome Things are ſuited to actuate our <hi>Joy</hi>; Others are fitted to agitate our <hi>Grief.</hi> Theſe latter are <hi>preſent Evils</hi>; and when they are <hi>perceived,</hi> Nature is <hi>diſpos'd</hi> to ſorrow. A mournful Senſation of Bereavements, and other Afflictions, is but agreable to the Law of our Creation, to the Tendency of our Nature, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002218_0017_0FDAD046908727C8"/>
the Dictates of right Reaſon. It agrees to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Make &amp; Frame; and is according to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Deſign</hi> of the Powers of Senſe and Paſſion which are ſo deeply planted in Us: and 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible indeed, while in the Body, to be untouch'd with ſorrowful Impreſſions within, when oppreſſive Troubles without invade Us. No Affliction is for the preſent joyous, but grievous. However ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it not an <hi>Impoſſibility,</hi> yet it is a culpable <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</hi> It is <hi>unreaſonable</hi> &amp; <hi>irreligious.</hi> Our afflicting Paſſions, as well as others, were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>intended</hi> for <hi>Exerciſe</hi>; the proper ſeaſon whereof is a day of Trouble. And They were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for <hi>good Ends</hi>; which can't be attain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſeaſonable and regular exerting of Them. <hi>Reaſon</hi> then condemns a Stoical Apathy under Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions: and Religion doth no leſs. Chriſtianity does not command nor commend, nor tend to effect a ſtupid Inſenſibleneſs under the Hand of GOD. Piety is not intended for the Extinction of Reaſon and Subverſion of Humanity. But the <hi>Deſign of Religion is to correct the Diſorders of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Affections,</hi> to guide and help Them in their Exerciſes on proper Occaſions. Goſpel-<hi>Light</hi> is deſign'd to <hi>direct</hi> Us, and Goſpel-<hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> Us, in governing our Paſſions to their reſpective Ends and adjuſting them to their various moving Cauſes. Religion then does not forbid, but only moderates ana regulates, our Sorrow under bereaving Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations. We may lawfully give Vent and Eaſe to our diſquieted Minds in penſive Groans and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and let out Grief operate and expreſs it ſelf in all natural and decent Ways —. Yea, This is what lies as a <hi>Duty</hi> upon Us, to order our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inward
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002218_0018_0FDAD068D2C7C8F8"/>
Frame and outward Behaviour according to our Condition, in Compliance with the Methods of Providence and from a Reverence to the holy Hand of GOD. We are to regard the Work of the LORD, and to conſider His Operation in all that befals Us; and ſhou'd ſtudy to comport with the Deſign and anſwer the Call of every Diſpenſation. Accordingly under Bereavements We are call'd to Weeping and Mourning; and <hi>GOD approves and expects,</hi> that We feel the ſtroke, that We be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly affected, and breath out our Grief in all the humble Expreſſions hereof: This is intimated in that Obſervation of the <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> Eccl. 7.2. <hi>It is better to go to the houſe of Mourning,</hi> [ſo He calls the Houſe where Death comes] <hi>than to the Houſe of Feaſting: for that it the End of all Men, and the Living</hi> [if They are wiſe and godly] <hi>will lay it to Heart.</hi> And ſo in that Caution of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.13. <hi>I wou'd not have You to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning Them which are aſleep, that Ye ſorrow not, even as others which have no Hope.</hi>— He <hi>allows</hi> the Sorrow; but <hi>checks</hi> the exceſſive Degree, and reproves perhaps alſo ſome unſeemly Ways of expreſſing It.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>GOD is highly diſpleas'd at a ſinful Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity under ſuch a mournful Bereavement: and to indulge This is truely a Symptom of wretched Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Abjectneſs of Mind.</hi> If we are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Judgments and do not reſent the Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of GOD in them, it is an awful Sign of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Security, and a daring Affront to the Divine Providence. There are many heavy Complaints on Record againſt the obdurate <hi>Jews</hi> of old upon
<pb facs="unknown:002218_0019_0FDAD047D1FED790"/>
this Account. Thus we read, Iſai. 42.25. <hi>He hath poured upon Jacob the fury of His Anger; and it hath ſet Him on fire round about, yet He knew it not; and it burned Him, yet He laid it not to Heart.</hi> So in Jer. 5.3. <hi>O Lord, Thou haſt ſtricken Them, but They have not grieved; They have refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Correction; They have made their Faces har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. than a Rock.</hi> And in the next Verſe He calls this Carriage <hi>Madneſs; I ſaid, Surely Theſe are fooliſh; for they Know not the way of the Lord</hi>; They conſider not <hi>the Judgment of GOD.</hi> And the Wiſe Man enters a Caveat againſt this Folly, Prov. 3.11. <hi>My ſon, Deſpiſe not the Chaſtening of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO be ſtupidly <hi>blind</hi> and not ſee the Hand of GOD ſmiting Us, or to be wilfully <hi>indolent</hi> and not feel the Weight and Smart of thoſe Blows we receive, loudly proclaims our want of a Chriſtian Temper of Soul, and ſadly evidences the Hardneſs of our Hearts and Atheiſm of our Minds. "Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence under the Effects of GDD's Anger is (as One ſpeaks) like the ſtilneſs of the dead Sea, whoſe Calm is a Curſe" —. To be reſolvedly inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and inconſiderate under Afflictions is to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den our ſelves againſt Diſcipline, and ſet GOD's Judgments at Defiance. It is to ſtrengthen our ſelves againſt the Almighty. It is a <hi>profane Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect &amp; Contempt of the Divine Wrath.</hi> And hence muſt needs offer very great Provocation to GOD. Nothing more exaſperates, than a ſlight of one's Diſpleaſure. <hi>To make light of the Wrath of GOD, is moſt certainly very incenſing to Him.</hi> — It is therefore prodigious Folly and Sin to be unaffected with GOD's Frown in the Death of near and dear
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002218_0020_0FDAD06B1E443310"/>
Relations, and particularly of our valuable Parents. Some in this Caſe ſhift off all troubleſome Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by flying to remaining temporal Comforts; or by an abuſive Applying the Conſideration of Death's being the End of all Men, looking on It as a neceſſary Event, a Thing of Courſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to every One, as what cou'd not be avoided, and for which there is no Remedy: and therefore It muſt be endur'd; Grief will be no Cure —. In ſome ſuch Ways as theſe, Many ſeek Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and bear up Themſelves by theſe Methods under the Loſs of Their Parents, and other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; without any View to the Hand of GOD or Senſe of His Anger out againſt Them.— But ſurely to be thus caſeleſs under Divine Rebukes, upon any Grounds whatſoever, diſcovers great Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Mind, and a ſecret Infidelity in the Heart. Where a Principle of Grace is in it's due Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, It will influence the Underſtanding to conſider the Tokens of GOD's Diſpleaſure, and will ſoften the Heart, &amp; cauſe a very tender and permanent Feeling of Them. Inſenſibility under the ſtrokes of GOD's Hand is not religious Conſtancy &amp; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, but a wicked and fooliſh Stupidity. It ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a very unhappy State of Soul; and offers a very heinous Indignity to Divine Providence.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>SOMETIMES the Death of a pious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leads the Way and opens the Door to many other Evils: be-ſure carnal Security under ſuch a ſtroke of GOD lays open to more heavy Judgments.</hi> Sometimes ſuch a Bereavement is the Fore-runner of great Evils. <hi>The Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002218_0021_0FDAD04951E7B998"/>AN Increaſe of <hi>moral Evil</hi> is often conſequent on ſuch a Providence. At the Gap, which the Death of a wiſe and good Mother makes, does many times enter in a Torrent of Impieties and Vices. It is very grievous to think, what Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, what Unrighteouſneſs, what Contention, what Intemperance, and other fooliſh Luſts, have found their Way into Families, after the Removal of the pious Mother; whoſe grave Preſence, and prudent Counſels, and Reproofs, together with Her holy Example, had kept a Check on the vicious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Children, and Others, while She was alive: but being now free from this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, They give Themſelves a Looſe and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in Sin. Yea what a ſenſible Decay of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Growth of Wickedneſs hath there been ſometimes among the <hi>Body of a People in a Town</hi> upon the Death of a <hi>Number</hi> of the godly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers therein; who have ſo conſiderable an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Family-Religion, which is neceſſary to Public Order! It is too notorious, that ſometimes a deplorable Change ſoon appears in the riſing Poſterity, when the gracious Mother is taken from Their Head: A degenerate Seed riſes up; and when it is thus with any Number of Families in a Place, the old Proverb is often verifyed, <hi>A little Leaven leaveneth the whole Lump.</hi> —</p>
            <p>MOREOVER, the Death of ſuch is often the <hi>Fore-runner of afflictive Judgments.</hi> The Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the pious Mother makes way for <hi>penal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> to come in upon the Family. There are Deaths perhaps to be multiply'd, or other Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to be inflicted; and from a tender Reſpect to this gracious Woman, GOD does <hi>gather
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002218_0022_0FDAD06C93DA6D90"/>
Her</hi> (as He did <hi>Joſiah,</hi>) <hi>to Her Grave in Peace, that Her Eyes may not ſee, and Her Heart be griev'd at the Evil</hi> to be brought on Her Children and Relations: And that <hi>He may not be put to deny the Requeſts</hi> of this fervent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor on their Behalf—. This pretious One muſt be ſafely lodg'd in Heaven, out of the Reach of all Griefs and Sufferings, before the deſtroying Angel has Commiſſion to execute Judgments on Her Poſterity. The <hi>Jewels</hi> are ſecur'd, before the <hi>Rubbiſh</hi> is conſumed. The Wheat is hous'd, when a Storm is riſing: and then the Doves flock to the Windows.</p>
            <p>IT looks <hi>ominous</hi> to the Family, when the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous praying Mother is taken away, who was One that <hi>ſtood in the Breach</hi> to turn away Wrath. The Death of ſuch an One leaves the ſurviving Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners under an ill Preſage: and the Cry of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd unto Them is that, in Luk. 23.28. (Sons,) <hi>Daughters, Weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves</hi> —. Weep and howl for your Miſeries that are coming upon you.</p>
            <p>BUT a ſupine and ſtubborn <hi>Apathy</hi> and <hi>Incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibleneſs,</hi> when under the Frown of Providence in the Removal of ſo great a Bleſſing, does for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain expoſe to &amp; forebode ſtill further Evils. Cold and carnal Security under this Judgment defeats the good Ends of It, and renders it altogether unprofitable to Us. And not only ſo, but it lays us open to yet more terrible Rebukes. If <hi>We will walk contrary to GOD, He alſo will walk contrary to Us, and puniſh us ſtill ſeven Times more,</hi> (Lev. 26.23, 4,) He has many other ways to afflict us. And if we are unaffected with one Judgment, He
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002218_0023_0FDAD04AD1363448"/>
will proceed to another. Verily, None ever harden'd Themſelves againſt GOD, and proſper'd He will multiply aggravated Miſchiefs on care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs unſubdued Sinners. <hi>With the obſtinate, He will ſhew Himſelf obſtinate.</hi> He will add to Their Yoke; and if They feel not the Whip, He will chaſtiſe Them with Scorpions. If more gentle Stripes are deſpis'd, ſometimes cutting Blows are given, 'till utter Deſtruction comes. But ſuppoſing there be a Reprieve from <hi>Temporal</hi> Ruin, yet moſt certainly there is an <hi>Everlaſting Perdition,</hi> to which irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamable Sinners are reſerv'd, in the coming World.</p>
            <p>TO be unhumbled then under ſuch a bereaving Diſpenſation, and impenitently to diſregard the Hand of GOD, is an ill Omen of more heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments approaching. Let this Thought ſerve to deter Us from ſuch Guilt and Folly; that there may be no Occaſion for renewing the Complaint, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57.1. The Righteous periſheth and <hi>no man layeth it to heart,</hi> and godly ones are taken away, <hi>None conſidering,</hi> that the Righteous is taken away from the Evil to come.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>TO mourn ſuch a Death has a Tendency to our ſpiritual Benefit, as it aſſiſts our right Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</hi> It will be profitable, not only to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate, but to excite and ſtrengthen a mournful Senſe of our Affliction; <q>not only to admit, but to enforce the Impreſſions of Sorrow upon this Occaſion.</q> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerves, that <hi>by the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Countenance the Heart is made better</hi>; and therefore <hi>the Heart of the Wiſe is in the Houſe of Mourning.</hi> On ſuch an Occaſion, the Wiſdom that is from above will diſpoſe and engage our Hearts to mournful Affections, and a religious
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002218_0024_0FDAD06E12A72D50"/>
Improvement of the ſorrowful Providence: And by this means, The Affliction may turn to our great Advantage. That which in it ſelf is ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous an Evil, may be made inſtrumental of the moſt bleſſed Effects, by the Grace of GOD. Out of the Eater may come forth Meat; and Honey be ſuck'd out of the Wormwood.</p>
            <p>IF we lay to heart the Bereavement, Our Minds will <hi>more attentively regard the holy Leſſons</hi> to be learnt from ſuch a Diſpenſation, and <hi>more eaſily receive Religious Impreſſions.</hi> Our Hearts muſt be ſubdued and melted in order to the good Purpoſes of Divine Grace. And when They are tender and ſoften'd under Troubles, We are in a greater Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedneſs to be wrought upon by the ſanctifying Spirit. <hi>Worldly Sorrow tends to godly Sorrow</hi>: for when the Spirit is tam'd and ſober'd, and reduced to a conſidering Frame, It will more readily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and reſent the moral Cauſe of Afflictions, which is Sin —. And the mournful Senſe of our Trouble will have a happy Tendency to <hi>wean Us from Creature-Comforts,</hi> conſidering the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Them. — And to promote our <hi>Acquaintance with GOD,</hi> and Deſires of His Favour, the good Part which can never be taken away. — It will alſo help to fix on our Minds a becoming <hi>Gravity,</hi> and check the Vanity We are ſo incident to. It will tend to <hi>put us on ſerious Work,</hi> and ſtir us up to Duty; to awaken our Activity in preparing for our own Death, and finiſhing the great Buſineſs, of Life. In a word, A true gracious Mourning pulls out the ſting of the Affliction, and turns the Curſe into a Bleſſing, the Croſs into a Comfort.</p>
            <p>THIS is the <hi>Benefit</hi> of laying to heart the Death
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002218_0025_0FDAD04C5382C040"/>
of near and dear Relatives, and this Conſideration ſhould induce Us to entertain &amp; cheriſh a penſive ſenſe of our Affliction in the Deceaſe of a godly Mother.</p>
            <p n="6">VII. <hi>WE ſhou'd be influenced hereto from a Principle of Honour, and Love to our deceaſed Parent.</hi> A gracious <hi>Mother in Iſrael,</hi> is an honourable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. The Scriptures do every where put abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Honour upon theſe Handmaids of the Lord, and peculiar were the Regards ſhown to ſuch by our <hi>bleſſed Saviour</hi> in the Days of His Fleſh<note n="†" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Colman's,</hi> Duty and Honour of Aged Women, <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6.</note>. Their name in Iſrael is that, Highly favour'd, and bleſſed among Women! The devout Mother is worthy therefore of a <hi>Singular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> from Men, eſpecially from Her own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The <hi>Fifth Commandment</hi> requires Us to <hi>honour our Mother,</hi> well as Father. And a ſolemn <hi>mourning Her Death</hi> is one very fit and decent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our Reverence to Her. A Tribute of Tears at our Loſs of Her is a very juſt piece of Homage to her Worth, &amp; a proper Inſtance of Filial Piety, due by all the Laws of Juſtice &amp; Gratitude. To refuſe Her this mark of Honour, infers a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Imputation, and is the moſt unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Baſeneſs, and Slight upon Her. To part with Her as if We ſuffer'd nothing by our Loſs, and were as happy without Her, as with Her, implys a very diſhonourable Reflection, and is great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to Her Merits. To <hi>die unlamented</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times denounced as a <hi>Curſe</hi>; Jer. 22.18. And the contrary promiſed as an <hi>Honour</hi>; Jer. 34.5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002218_0026_0FDAD06F90F73B30"/>AND to mourn Her Death is an agreeable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our <hi>Love</hi> to Her, as well as Honour for Her. A pious Mother ought to have a deep ſhare in our Affections; and We ſhould teſtify our Love in <hi>all</hi> the proper Expreſſions of it. A ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble laying to Heart and lamenting Her Death, is none of the leaſt Tokens of filial Affection; and therefore is what we are oblig'd to. Innumerable have been the Proofs of Her Love to Us, Her tender Cares and endearing Labours for Us from the Womb; and ſuch as truly are beyond our Retaliation. And it may be, when We ſeriouſly reflect, our own Hearts reproach Us for many Omiſſions of filial Duty in Her Life-time, and that We have not given ſuch Proofs of our Love to Her, Care of Her, and Delight in Her, as were due from Us. We ſhou'd therefore now endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>repair former Defects</hi> by this laſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Inſtance of Love and Reſpect. Let Her die <hi>lamented,</hi> to ſhew that ſhe liv'd <hi>deſir'd,</hi> Let Her Death be a Grief to Us, to ſhow that Her Life was a Joy to Us. We ſhou'd account our good Mothers <hi>worthy of this double Honour</hi>; and are inexcuſable, if We do not pay it Them.</p>
            <p n="7">VIII. <hi>WE have Scripture-Example to argue for this mourning the Death of our gracious Mothers.</hi> I ſhall mention only one Inſtance; and that is <hi>Iſaac</hi> mourning for his Mother <hi>Sarah.</hi> This is intimated in <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.67. <hi>Iſaac</hi> brought Her into his Mother <hi>Sarah's</hi> Tent, and took <hi>Rebekah</hi> and ſhe became his Wife; and He loved Her: And <hi>Iſaac was comforted after his Mother's Death. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> had been dead now about <hi>Three Years</hi>: Yet the ſorrowful ſenſe of Her Death was not worn
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002218_0027_0FDAD04DD2638500"/>
off till now. It continued till the Comfort of a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>nearer</hi> Relation was brought in to ballance it. Truly an affectionate and dutiful Son was <hi>Iſaac</hi> to His Mother while living, and an hearty Mourner for Her when dead.</p>
            <p>NOW this was written <hi>for our Enſample and Admonition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND thus I have ſhown, That it is lawful and proper, yea a Duty to mourn the Loſs of a dear and gracious Mother. I have been longer on this Point than I deſign'd, and it may be alſo than there was need, eſpecially in the preſent Caſe. Tho' many times, I muſt confeſs, there ſeems to be too much neceſſity for the preſſing and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating this Duty on the careleſs Poſterity of ſome Pious Women, upon the like occaſion. Indeed Children's Love and Regard to their Parents li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or dead, commonly needs a Spur, tho' the Parents too often need a Curb.</p>
            <p>BUT now being convinced of the Duty; our Concern is to know, <hi>How we may diſcharge it aright.</hi> I ſhall therefore briefly hint at one or two neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Qualifications of this Mourning.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>IT muſt be well-grounded, and flow from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might in the firſt Place have ſaid, It muſt be a <hi>Real</hi> and ſolid Grief; not an airy Pretence and affected Shew. It muſt be inward, and not lie merely in Words and Actions. <hi>The Heart must be full</hi>; Impreſſions within agreeable to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions without. But this is not all: It muſt be a <hi>Religious</hi> Grief; Voluntary and Choſen, Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and Rational, Pious and Devout; It muſt be a gracious Paſſion, rais'd upon ſpiritual Principles and Views.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002218_0028_0FDAD0711287E580"/>
               <hi>FAITH</hi> in the Providence of GOD muſt lie in the Foundation of this ſorrow. In the Mourning our Loſs, there muſt be a Reſpect to the original efficient Cauſe, and an acknowlegement of the Divine Dominion over Us and all our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. We muſt ſee the <hi>Providence of GOD</hi> in the Bereavement; and it muſt be very hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to Us, to conſider the <hi>Hand that ſmites us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THERE muſt be the <hi>Fear</hi> of GOD in Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and a <hi>Senſe of His Diſpleaſure,</hi> ſitting heavy upon Us. An Apprehenſion of the Frown and Rebuke of Divide Providence in the Affliction, ſhould move the inward Springs of Paſſion, and more ſenſibly affect Us than the outward Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble however ſevere and piercing. And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>our Guilt and Demerits</hi> ſhould yet more deeply affect our Hearts, ſharpen our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments and fill Us with Bitterneſs of Soul. Sin, the deſerving Cauſe of our Affliction, muſt ſting our Breaſts and tear our Bowels.</p>
            <p>AND further, Our Grief muſt be animated by a Principle of <hi>Love</hi> to GOD, The Reaſon of our Mourning muſt not be ſo much the Loſs of a mere Creature-comfort, as that We are depriv'd of a Bleſſing, in which We ſaw and enjoy'd much of GOD. We muſt <hi>lament after GOD,</hi> who in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of pious and uſeful Perſons, ſo far withdraws Himſelf, &amp; calls home His Spirit. This Tho't muſt give a peculiar Accent to our Lamentations, that <hi>a Godly</hi> Perſon is ceaſed, who had much of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of GOD with Her, and was a rich Bleſſing to Us on Spiritual Accounts; and by whoſe Death ſo much of our Defenſe &amp; Glory is departed, and ſo much of our Spiritual Stock of Gifts and Graces,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002218_0029_0FDAD04F53557A68"/>
Prayers and Services gone; that one Token of the Divine Preſence is taken away, and one Stream from the Fountain of living Waters dried up, which was a Refreſhment and a Furtherance to Us in the Way of Life. — This is to mourn <hi>after</hi> GOD, and <hi>according to</hi> GOD, when mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Bereavements. — Thus Love to GOD, muſt be the Root of our Sorrow.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, There muſt be <hi>a Spirit of Obedience</hi> acting of Us. Our Mourning muſt be from Conſcience of Duty, &amp; in Submiſſion to GOD's Authority, who expects and demands This of Us. Our mourning the Death of a gracious Parent ſhould be in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the 5th Command, which (as hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd) requires Us to pay this our laſt ſolemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect &amp; Duty to our Father &amp; Mother. It muſt alſo be with <hi>ſincere Aims</hi> at the Glory of GOD, (which our Chriſtian Mourning under ſuch a frowning Providence hath various ways an Aſpect upon) and not merely in Compliance with the Impulſes of Nature, or with the decent Uſage of the World.</p>
            <p>THUS We muſt be influenced by Spiritual Principles and Motives in our Lamenting the Death of a pious Mother. Elſe tho' natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection may work a little, It is but as the Groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; Howling of the Beaſts that have no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Our Grief is but a carnal, abſurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant Paſſion; and profiteth us nothing. And indeed unleſs We are moved by ſuch Religious Principles, it will be exceeding difficult, if not impoſſible, to <hi>govern</hi> our Sorrow aright; which is another Thing incumbent on Us. Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>OUR Mourning muſt be well regulated</hi>; and that both as to the Degree and the Duration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:002218_0030_0FDAD0729176D340"/>
               <hi>AS to the Degree</hi>; This muſt be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the occasion; a great Lamentation, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Greatneſs of the Loſs: Our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the preſent Caſe (the Death of a wiſe, good and excellent Mother) muſt be very <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>pungent.</hi> This is a juſt Debt of Honour to the Memory of the Dead, whoſe Relation to Us was ſuperior and nearer than moſt, and a due Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Hand of GOD, the Blow whereof now comes nigher to Us, and lies heavier upon Us, than in moſt other Caſes. This is intimated in the the Text, <hi>I bowed heavily,</hi> as one that mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his Mother. And yet We muſt carefully watch againſt <hi>Exceſs,</hi> and all the Signs of it, as Rage, Deſpair, Neglect of Duty, Ingratitude for Mercies continued, and the like.</p>
            <p>OUR Sorrow is inordinate, when it exceeds the juſt Merits of the Cauſe; ſo when our private Grief excludes the ſenſe of Public Calamitys; when it cauſes a Brutiſh Oblivion of former Mercies and a baſe Contempt of preſent Enjoyments; when it unfits Us for, diverts Us from, or diſtracts Us in the Duties of our Civil or Chriſtian Calling; when it breaks our Health, and our Spirits ſink under oppreſſive Heavineſs; when we voluntarily amplify and aggravate our Affliction, give Way to and delight in Melancholy, and fooliſhly cheriſh our diſconſolate Frames by one unhappy Method and another, refuſe to be comforted, and are deaf to ſuch Conſiderations as tend to ſuppreſs or allay our Sorrow: When We ſuffer our Grief to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into ſullen Diſcontent, impatient Froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or angry Murmur againſt Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and break out into extravagant Speeches
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002218_0031_0FDAD050D193C180"/>
or turbulent Actions. When it is thus with Us; onr Sorrow is exorbitant, and ſwells beyond it's proper Banks, And ſuch intemperate Grief in all the Signs and Expreſſions of it, is to be moſt heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guarded againſt, let the Bereavement We are under be attended with never ſuch wounding Aggravations. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto GOD, I have borne Chaſtiſement; I will bear the Indignation of the Lord</hi>; and truly, <hi>it is good for a Man, that He</hi> patiently and ſubmiſſively <hi>bear the Yoke in His Youth.</hi> We muſt take heed, that we do not fret and fume and fling as the Wild Bull in a Net, or be untractable as the wild Aſs which is uſed to the Wilderneſs. We muſt not <hi>Roar like Bears</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks) but <hi>Mourn ſore like Doves,</hi> with a humble and quiet Spirit. There muſt be a <hi>Chriſtian Calm</hi> in the Mind, and <hi>quiet Reſignation</hi> to the Will of GOD; as becomes thoſe who believe His Sovereignty, Wiſdom, Goodneſs an Faithfulneſs to His Promiſes; and as becomes thoſe <hi>who are not as others, without Hope.</hi> We muſt not mourn as blind and ignorant Heathen, who were Strangers to the Faith and Hope of the Goſpel, for ſuch as die in the Lord. We muſt calm our ruffled Paſſions, and eaſe our oppreſſed Minds by conſidering <hi>the Deſigns of Providence,</hi> and <hi>the Encouragements of the Goſpel.</hi> Concerning them who ſleep in Jeſus, We believe that they are remov'd from us to their unſpeakable Gain, receiv'd to Glory, tranſlated to a better Country, even an Heavenly. And concerning our ſelves, We have Hope, that GOD will ſanctify their Death unto Us for Spiritual Profit, and repair the Loſs with unperiſhable Bleſſings in Chriſt Jeſus; and
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002218_0032_0FDAD07410F4ED58"/>
there is Hope, if We are Followers of Them who thro' Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes, that We ſhall with ſongs of Joy meet them in Heaven again, never (never) to part more.— And now with theſe Hopes We ſhou'd temper our Grief, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate our ſwelling Paſſions, and bank up our flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tears, at the Deceaſe of our wiſe and holy and excellent Parents.— Thus as to the Meaſure, our Grief muſt be under the Reſtraints of Reaſon and Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SO as to the Duration.</hi> Our Grief muſt neither be of too <hi>ſhort,</hi> nor of too <hi>long</hi> a Continuance. On the preſent <hi>extraordinary</hi> Occaſion, before it muſt not be a <hi>tranſient Pang</hi> of ſorrow: but there muſt be a laſting Impreſſion of ſuch a Providence. We muſt not ſoon forget our Affliction and let our ſorrowful Reſentments quickly cool and die away. <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Grief for His Mother's Death was not worn off of a long Time, as was obſerved before. — Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, It muſt not (neither) be an <hi>obſtinate Courſe</hi> of reſtleſs Melancholy, as if the Loſs were inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable and irreparable. No; this reſolved, fixed, Grief can't be reconcil'd with Chriſtian Submiſſion, and therefore is not to be indulged. Tho' it is lawful and prudent to let Nature have it's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Operation, and breath out it's Grief with freedom; yet ſanctify'd Reaſon muſt ſet the Bounds both as to Degree &amp; Duration. The Wiſdom that is from above muſt limit the Time of our Funeral-ſorrows, by regarding the Rules of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND thus I have ſhown, How &amp; Why We are to mourn the Death of a gracious Mother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT are We only to mourn and weep</hi>? Will
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002218_0033_0FDAD0525384F6A8"/>
Tears for the Loſs ſuffice? Nay; but our Mourning muſt be accompany'd with &amp; occaſional of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous other Duties &amp; religious Exerciſes, Diſpoſitions, and Reſolutions; which I ſhall mention, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p>THUS, <hi>Under this ſorrowful Bereavement, We muſt be ſtrict and ſerious in Self-Examination, with reference to our Conduct in the Relation of Children to the Deceaſed.</hi> We muſt examine our ſelves and try our Ways, with Diligence and Impartiality. And if We find in any Inſtances or Degrees We have approved our ſelves dutiful &amp; obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and have been a Comfort and not a Grief and Heavineſs to our Mother, then We ſhou'd rejoyce with thankful Praiſes to GOD; unto whoſe Grace We muſt aſcribe all that hath been commendable and praiſe-worthy in Us.—And on the other hand, Whatſoever has been amiſs (as no doubt there has firſt or laſt been much ſo,) We muſt repent hereof with Shame and Grief of Heart. If We have err'd, in an inordinate Love to, Delight in, and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on our deceaſed Parent, while with Us; or if We have ſlighted Her, been diſobedient to Her, under-valu'd the Mercy of GOD to Us in Her, and not ſought the Good by Her that was to be gotten, We muſt lay it to Heart now We are mourning Her Deceaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We muſt humble our ſelves before GOD for all the Follys and Failings of every Kind, which we ſtand chargeable with.</p>
            <p>I will here take Leave to tranſcribe a Paſſage to my Purpoſe, out of an excellent Author, which has occurr'd to me ſince the Delivering my Sermon: <q>Children ſhould conſider upon the Death of <hi>Holy Parents,</hi> in what Inſtances They failed of

hearkning to their Counſels, and following Their Inſtructions, Admonitions and Examples; of paying that Honour, Reverence, Duty and Obedience which GOD Commands. They ſhould <hi>then</hi> remember, conſider, and mourn to think how often their Miſcarriages againſt GOD, and Them, were a Grief and Burden to their Souls, and made them walk ſoftly: They ſhou'd recall the Vanity of Their Childhood, and review the Stubbornneſs, and Frowardneſs, and Intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of their Youth; and the many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Provocations They were guilty of while Their Parents lived; againſt their frequent Reproofs, againſt the Cry of Their Prayers, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Tears, againſt Their many Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and compaſſionate Calls to Repentance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the Methods GOD uſed to awaken, humble and reform Them: Is not This the Voice of ſuch a Rod to many Children, when their godly Parents are taken away by Death<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Shower</hi>'s Mourners Companion, Part 1. <hi>pag</hi> 164.</note>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſhould hear the Voice of GOD, and ſtudy to anſwer His Call in the preſent Viſitation, by ſincerely Repenting of all our Miſdemeanours, in the Character of Children. We muſt <hi>Sorrow to Repentance</hi>; this is to be ſorry <hi>after a godly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> as is hinted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. We muſt purſue one Grief with another, Natural with Spiritual. This is a Diverſion of our Reſentments to the right Object. When We turn the Current of our Grief, upon Sin, (from the Effect to the Cauſe) then our Tears run in their proper Channel. <hi>The Sorrow of this World, worketh Death</hi>; but <hi>Godly Sorrow worketh Repentance unto Life.</hi> As, when a
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002218_0035_0FDAD053D12FBFF0"/>
Man bleeds dangerouſly in one place, then, to open a Vein elſewhere, turns the Courſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents the fatal Conſequence.</p>
            <p>THUS our Sorrow for the Bereavement, muſt be follow'd with Sorrow for our Sins, which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked GOD to contend with Us by ſo awful and awakening a Providence. And with Repentance toward GOD, there muſt be Faith towards our Lord JESUS CHRIST, whereby We rely on Him for the Remiſſion of our Sins thro' His Blood.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, <hi>We ſhou'd remember and give GOD the Glory of all that was excellent and valuable in our deceaſed Parent.</hi> Her <hi>Infirmities</hi> (the <hi>few</hi> ſhe might have) which are put off with Mortality, We muſt cover in Silence, &amp; bury in Oblivion; but Her <hi>Excellencys,</hi> that were many and which are perfected in the Glory of GOD. We muſt call to Mind, admire, and ſpeak of. This is a very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural &amp; fitting Concomitant of our Mourning, and a due Tribute of Honour to Her Memory, as well as a juſt Regard to the Honour of Divine Grace, by which She was what She was, and which ought this way to be magnified. Let GOD then have the Glory of thoſe ſhining Graces &amp; Gifts that adorn'd Her. Let <hi>Her Children riſe up and call Her bleſſed</hi>; Let Them ſpeak aloud Her due Praiſes: Let Them ſpeak often to one another, and on proper Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to Others; Let them tell how She liv'd, and ſay how She dy'd. Let Them ſay what an exact, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, univerſal <hi>Chriſtian</hi> She was; what a loving &amp; obſequious <hi>Wife</hi>; what a careful, wiſe and tender <hi>Parent</hi>; what an affectionate and reſpectful <hi>Siſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> what a diſcreet and condeſcending <hi>Miſtreſs</hi>; what a true and conſtant <hi>Friend</hi>; what a courteous, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002218_0036_0FDAD07710E3AF48"/>
and obliging <hi>Neighbour,</hi> &amp;c. In a word, we muſt endeavour modeſtly to ſet forth all the various Parts of Her bright and juſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; which made Her Perſon ſo lovely &amp; vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to Us while She liv'd, &amp; will render Her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ever pretious and delightful to Us, now She's gone: And which in her Life-time She deſir'd (in great Humility) might be hid (as much as poſſible) from the View and Obſervation of the World; not deſiring (nor able to bear with) the Praiſe of Men: but now She is out of Hearing, 'tis nothing leſs than Decency and Duty in Her Children to ſtand up and <hi>tell of Her good Deeds,</hi> and relate Her Virtues; and never to mention Her Name, but with the utmoſt Reſpect and Honour. A lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Thing it is in the Children of ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Parent, to ſet Themſelves to ſhew forth Her deſerved Praiſes: 'tis a good and pleaſant Work, which We ſhou'd always be ready to <hi>Riſe up and engage in</hi>

            <p>FURTHER, <hi>We muſt recollect and thankfully acknowlege to GOD the many Favours and Bleſſings He has Diſpenſed to Us in and by our deceaſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi> A wiſe and good Mother is a ſingular Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; which does not fall to every ones ſhare. This is the Gift of GOD, a rich Gift and invaluable Privilege. Wherefore We ſhould praiſe GOD for the Riches of His Goodneſs, in the Diſpoſal of Us into this happy Relation. <hi>We ſhou'd bleſs GOD, that ever We had ſo excellent a Parent</hi>; that He did chuſe out ſuch a Perſon to bring Us into the World, and to bring Us up in the World; who was of ſo admirable a Temper, eaſy and ſoft, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Weakneſs; ſo prudent in Her Conduct towards Us, uſing Authority without Severity, being ſtrict without Ill-nature; ſo tenderly careful about, and watchful over Us; ſo early &amp; conſtantly pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Inſtructing and Educating of Us; ſo ſolemn in Her Charges upon Us to give up our ſelves to GOD; ſo fervent and unceaſing in Her Prayers for Us; <hi>even travailing in Birth of Us again</hi> until She cou'd <hi>ſee Chriſt formed in Us</hi>: ſo exemplary in Her Walk before Us; ſo aſſiſting to Us in our Walk with GOD; being always a prudent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillor and faithful Monitor to Us, exciting Us to Duty, reproving Us for Sin, warning Us againſt Temptations, directing Us in Difficulties, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging Us under Doubts and Fears, comforting Us
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002218_0038_0FDAD07890FC01D8"/>
under Troubles and Afflictions, and confirming Us in the Way of Truth. Theſe, and many other good Offices of Her's from our Birth, We have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, and ought to acknowlege with the moſt grateful Senſe of Divine Goodneſs to Us herein. Every Relative is to Us all that and only that, which GOD makes the ſame to be. We ought then to bleſs GOD that We have had ſo great a Bleſſing in a Mother; And <hi>We muſt be very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that We enjoy'd her ſo long</hi>; A Privilege which not a few in the World are deny'd. <q>What poor ſhifts had We made in our Minority, if We had not had a good Mother to comfort Us?</q>

If She had not been continued to Us, until our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival to Maturity, How many Bleſſings and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts had We miſs'd of? How many Diſadvantages had We met with? We ſhould be thankful then that She was ſpar'd to Us ſo long.</p>
            <p>AND further, We ſhou'd <hi>obſerve and reſent the various Mercys mix'd with the Judgment.</hi> We ſhou'd take a thankful Notice of what <hi>Comforts remain to Us.</hi> Have We our honoured Father ſtill living, or kind Parents in Law, or tender Conſorts, or lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Brothers &amp; Siſters, and other Relatives and Friends continued to Us? We ſhou'd be thankful herefor. It is of the Mercy of GOD, that We are not left altogether Solitary and Deſolate. And then the Comfort We had in the <hi>Manner and Circumſtances of our late Parent's Death,</hi> ſhou'd be obſerved with Gratitude. Thus had We by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Her previous Illneſs and Languiſhment, <hi>a weaning Time,</hi> &amp; ſpace for preparing to meet GOD
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002218_0039_0FDAD056D2693220"/>
in the Way of Judgment? Had She opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and aſſiſtance to <hi>glorify GOD</hi> by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Acts of Faith, and an inviolable Patience, and Submiſſion to the Divine Will on her Death-bed; by a lively exerciſing and expreſſing Her Love to, and Delight in GOD. Her Truſt in Chriſt, Her Repentance for Sin, Her Gratitude for Mercys, Her Contempt of the World, Her Deſire and Hope of Eternal Life; and by leaving Her Teſtimony for the Excellency, Sweetneſs and Benefit of a Holy Walk and Communion with GOD, (upon long Experience even from a Child,) <hi>Was this the Caſe</hi>? Truly it is a very comfortable Reflection, and juſt matter of Thanksgiving. But it is yet <hi>more</hi> comfortable; if <hi>We had Opportunity to be preſent</hi> with Her in Her Sickneſs and latter Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; to ſee the End of the Lord; to behold the Trial of Her Faith, and Her Example of ſuffering Affliction; to ſee the happy Exit of Her good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Chriſt; Her Patience in waiting at the Door, and her Hope of entring within the Vail: to hear Her dying Prayers for Us, to receive Her dying Counſels to Us; and attend Her heavenly Diſcourſes, wherein <hi>out of the good Treaſure in Her Heart, She brought forth good things new and old.</hi> If We had Opportunity to be thus edified and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Her on Her Sick-bed, This muſt needs be a <hi>very refreſhing Mixture</hi> in our bitter Cup, and beſpeaks very thankful Acknowlegements of the Divine Favour to Us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND now</hi> (I may add) <hi>Let Us gather up as many as We can of the wiſe Sayings and gracious Words that fell from Her Lips</hi>; the wholeſome <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>LET us alſo remember her Pious Example,</hi> (in which was given us a fair Copy of every Chriſtian Grace and Virtue,) <hi>and be Imitators of Her as dear Children.</hi> Let us ever keep her excelling Pattern in our Eye; and thoſe Things which We have both <hi>learned</hi> &amp; <hi>receiv'd</hi> &amp; <hi>heard</hi> from Her, <hi>and ſeen in Her,</hi> do; and the GOD of Peace ſhall be with Us. Diligent Imitation of Her will be the beſt Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Love to Her, and the trueſt and moſt ſignificant Commendation of Her.

And in this Way we ſhall (it may be) obtain the ſame good Report of all Men which She had, &amp; as She has done, leave a ſweet Perfume on our Name at Death; and have the like happy Exit out of the World; &amp; an equal Inheritance with Her in Glory; and perhaps in like manner leave of our Poſterity to be ſerving GOD on Earth while We ſhall be praiſing Him in Heaven.

            </head>
            <p>THE foregoing Sermon on the Death of my late honoured Mother, was deſign'd &amp; calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated more for the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> &amp; <hi>Edification</hi> of the Living, than the <hi>Commendation</hi> of the Dead. Yet from the few <hi>occaſional Hints</hi> interſperſed in the Diſcourſe, (tho' not particularly apply'd to <hi>Her,</hi> becauſe in General applicable to and intended for the <hi>other</hi> excellent Gentlewomen, (Her dear Friends in Heaven before Her,) whom I did alſo deſign to commemorate, and for the Loſs of whom our Tears are ſet a flowing afreſh by this repeated ſtroke,) I ſay, from the few looſe Hints given in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, We may in ſome Meaſure form Her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. I did not aim at a full exact Portraiture and Deſcription of Her: or if I did, I'm ſure I have wonderfully fallen ſhort, and miſcarry'd in the Attempt. What has been ſaid might here be <hi>confirm'd,</hi> and Abundance more be <hi>added</hi> with great Truth and Juſtice. But I confeſs, I am afraid to <hi>enlarge</hi> any further in Her juſt Praiſes, leſt They, that <hi>know Her not,</hi> ſhou'd tax my Veracity, and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine me to be brib'd &amp; bias'd by my Affection and Relation to Her. And as for Thoſe that were <hi>acquainted with Her,</hi> They <hi>need not</hi> me to illuſtrate Her worthy, or recall to their Thoughts what ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd Her to Them while living, and cauſes them (now She's dead) to ſpeak of Her in ſuch Terms of Reſpect &amp; Honour, as loudly proclame Their juſt Value for Her Memory, &amp; deep Reſentment of Their Loſs. Her intimate Friends were <hi>choſen</hi> Ones, and good Judges of real Merit: Unto Them I <hi>appeal</hi> as Witneſſes to the Truth of all that I have ſpoken in
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002218_0045_0FDAD05B51FA3FC8"/>
Her Praiſe: and to Them I leave it to tell, Why They will ſo readily own, She was diſtinguiſh'd from the greateſt Part of Her Sex, and had not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Equals.—Only I will venture my ſelf to ſay, That few, I believe, have paſſed through the World with greater Repute, and more general Eſteem, or more fully come up to the rare Character of the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Woman,</hi> given by the Wiſe <hi>Propheteſs</hi> in the laſt Chapter of the Proverbs. She was indeed blameleſs and greatly beloved from Her Youth up. She was (as I'm told by yet-living Witneſſes) an apt, a grave, a very promiſing and deſirable <hi>Child</hi>; and as She grew in Years, ſo ſhe <hi>increaſed in Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>in Favour with GOD and Man.</hi>— She had the Happineſs to be born of <hi>excellent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> (Two of the moſt eminent Chriſtians in Their Day,) who took great Care not only for Her <hi>polite</hi> Breeding, but her <hi>religious</hi> Education; and <hi>the ſame unfeigned Faith,</hi> that dwelt in them, was found in Her alſo. She was <hi>in ſubjection to Them with all Gravity,</hi> and (as the Apoſtle teaches all Young Women to be) <hi>Sober, diſcrete, chaſte, a keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at Home,</hi> [reſerv'd, diligent,] <hi>good</hi>; and <hi>in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour as becometh Holineſs</hi>; unſpotted with thoſe Vanities &amp; Vices, which are the too common Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes of unguarded Youth. She was a Pattern of ſtrict Virtue, Morality, and good Carriage. And as bright an Example of Piety and Devotion; early addicting Her Self to Retirement for Cloſet-Duties; Delighting in Prayer &amp; Meditation, in Reading and Hearing GOD's Word, and in religious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and Conference with good People.— And Her Piety was <hi>undiſſembled</hi>; a vital Reality, built on ſolid Principles, inſpir'd from Above. Her
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002218_0046_0FDAD07E92AFEB98"/>
Religion was not <hi>Superficial:</hi> but <hi>internal,</hi> and <hi>deep-laid</hi> on a good <hi>Foundation of Repentance from dead Works, and of Faith towards GOD.</hi> She was the Eternal <hi>King's Daughter,</hi> by Spiritual Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and therefore <hi>glorious within</hi>; which was the Character (She has pleaſantly told Me) a Pious Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter once complemented Her with, when Young.

               </hi> &amp; <hi>real</hi> Chriſtian. And (as I've known Her humbly own with admiring Praiſes of the Divine Goodneſs to Her) She had, in Her Youth, <hi>a good Hope thro' Grace</hi>; and was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of a ſaving Work of the Spirit in Her, upon ſearching Her Heart, and examining Her ſelf by the Characters of the Regenerate laid down in the Scriptures, and comparing Her own Experiences with thoſe of other true Penitents.— And as She was an <hi>Early Convert,</hi> ſo by a patient Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Well-doing She came to be <hi>an Eminent Saint.</hi> She was a rare Pattern of ſtedfaſt Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Growth in Grace. And (which is all I ſhall add concerning Her Life) in the ſeveral Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that She came into, She was very Exemplary to the laſt; She died <hi>well reported of for good Works</hi>; having been <hi>obedient to Her own Husband</hi>; having <hi>brought up Children</hi>; and <hi>guided well Her Houſe</hi>; having <hi>lodged Strangers</hi>; having <hi>waſhed the Saints Feet</hi>; having <hi>reliev'd the Afflicted</hi>; and <hi>diligently follow'd every good Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND what now remains, but to ſay ſomething about the <hi>Manner of Her Death</hi>; Her Frame and Carriage in Her laſt Hours? And all I intend to offer, ſhall be (chiefly from my own Obſervation and Memory,) ſome Paſſages that may tend to the Honour of GOD's Grace in and with Her; or
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002218_0047_0FDAD05CD1092CF0"/>
be proper for our Imitation, Encouragement and Quickning.</p>
            <p>HER <hi>Patience</hi> was truly admirable. She was exercis'd for ſome Time with great, continual and very tedious Pains, which were a ſufficient Trial of Her Patience; But She bore all with a Chriſtian Silence and ſteddy Calmneſs &amp; Firmneſs of Spirit. And when a very ſhocking Turn ſometimes forced Her to liſp out a Complaint of, <hi>Pain, Pain</hi>! She wou'd inſtantly correct Her ſelf, and rebuke Her [ſeeming] Impatience; ſaying, <q>But 'tis my heavenly Father, who is thus chaſtning of Me, and I deſerve it, — I deſerve what is infinitely worſe. And I hope all is meant unto Good.</q> Once in ſome of Her laſt Moments, She ſpake out with a pleaſant Look &amp; Tone, ſaying, <hi>O this is incomparable Pain</hi>! —and repeated the ſurpriſing Expreſſion. She had almoſt an invincible Fortitude of Mind. She wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Lord, and He ſtrengthen'd Her.</p>
            <p>AND Her <hi>Reſignation</hi> was as remarkable. Her often-repeated Words were, <q>I freely ſubmit to the Will of my heavenly Father, whether for Life or Death. I'm content; His Will be done! I am willing to die; or if it be His Pleaſure that I ſhall live ſtill and ſuffer, I am alſo willing. I leave my ſelf wholly to His alwiſe Diſpoſe.</q> Only She added, <q>Let GOD be with Me, and help Me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to the End!</q>
            </p>
            <p>HER <hi>Contempt of the World</hi> was ſingular. She was got above the Deſire &amp; Love of Life. Once on my putting the Queſtion to Her; <hi>If She deſir'd to live any longer here, Upon what Motive it was</hi>? She reply'd with a certain Vehemence, (that ſpake Her Sincerity,) <hi>"I don't deſire it at all, Child.</hi> —
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002218_0048_0FDAD08064D342E8"/>
Only She added this ſutable Corrective; <q>I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit intirely to the Will of GOD; I am willing to live &amp; ſuffer yet, if He will be with me.</q> — Once She ſeem'd to <hi>forbid</hi> us to pray for Her being any longer abſent from the Lord. And it is remarkable that when ask'd, What ſpecial Petitions She would have put up for Her? I don't remember, that She at any time mentioned <hi>Recovery</hi>: but Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and Acceptance with GOD, and His gracious ſanctifying and comforting Preſence with Her, were the Sum of Her Deſires.—When her Indiſpoſition <hi>began</hi> to grow upon Her, She was apprehenſive of Death's Approach, and ſaid, <q>I have done with this World; all my Concern now is to ſee my way ſafe and clear out of it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SHE was in a very <hi>humble, lowly, and penitent Frame.</hi> She abhorr'd Her ſelf, and repented in Duſt &amp; Aſhes. She ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>GOD is now chaſtning me for Sin. I deſerve all this, &amp; Infinitely more.</hi>
               </q>— Upon which I ask'd Her, Whether She ſpake of any more heinous Provocation, which She tho't might be the particular procuring Cauſe of this Viſitation: But She anſwer'd with great Modeſty in the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>; ſaying, <q>No, No; I bleſs GOD, who by His Grace hath kept Me. I can't accuſe my ſelf of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd heinous Tranſgreſſions, nor do I know of any Sin unrepented of.</q>—Still She ſaid, She deſerv'd all that was laid upon Her; and that was Her Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, <q>Lord, Hear in Heaven, and Forgive, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and do, for thy mercy's ſake.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, The <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> was in a very vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Exerciſe. She had a powerful ſenſe of GOD on Her Mind, the higheſt Reverence of His awful Majeſty, and a becoming Dread of His terrible Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002218_0049_0FDAD08D915C7158"/>
It was a great Expreſſion of Her's; <q>Leaving this World is nothing to Me, Putting off this Body ſeems nothing to Me; but <hi>(being jealous over her ſelf with a godly Jealouſy, as becomes the beſt &amp; brighteſt Saint on this ſide Heaven, She add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,)</hi> To think of going into the Preſence of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely holy and Heart-ſearching Judge, This makes me bluſh and tremble.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SHE had a ſtrong &amp; genuine <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi> She ſaid, <q>I am a poor unprofitable Servant, and have Nothing to boaſt of. Free Favour is my only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. I have nothing to depend on, but the free Mercy of God in Chriſt; and in that I truſt.</q> — She thus expreſs'd Her Faith in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone for Juſtification; renouncing all Dependence on Her own Righteouſneſs, as a ſandy Foundation, that, if truſted to, would deceive Her into Ruin; realizing it, (as I have known Her ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to expreſs Her ſelf,) that the Imperfections attending Her beſt Obedience were enough, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the holy GOD to condemn Her, though She were guilty of no other Sins; and that nothing but the Merits and Interceſſion of CHRIST were to be rely'd upon.— She alſo acted Faith in CHRIST, as Her <hi>Strength,</hi> as well as Righteouſneſs, often calling upon Him in ſuch Terms as theſe; — <q>O my compaſſionate High-Prieſt, my Strong Redeemer, Help Me, Help Me, O my Compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Saviour! Put underneath thine everlaſting Arms, ſupport and ſave Me.</q>— It might have been ſaid unto Her, <hi>O Woman great is thy Faith</hi>!</p>
            <p>AGAIN, <hi>Love</hi> to Her GOD, and SAVIOUR, was now kindled into a Flame.</p>
            <p>WHEN I was once endeavouring to aſſiſt Her in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002218_0050_0FDAD081939D54F0"/>
clearing up the Evidences of Her Adoption, among other Queſtions of Trial, I ask'd Her, Whether She cou'd heartily joyn with the Pſalmiſt in ſaying to GOD, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee,</hi> — Here She prevented me and ſaid, <q>Yes, Yes, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides Him!</q> — Her Heart was full of holy Longings after GOD. She often breath'd out her flaming Deſires in ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical Expreſſions as thoſe; <q>Lord, Lift thou up the Light of thy Countenance. O let thy Face ſhine upon me, and be merciful unto me. O my GOD, I am caſt down; Thou ſetteſt Me in Darkneſs; Thou hideſt thy face from Me: and what ſhall I do? Mine Eyes are unto Thee. I cry to Thee, O my GOD, in the Day-time, and in the Night: but Thou anſwereſt Me not. O my GOD, in Thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is Life.</q> 
               <hi>Crown Me with thy Loving kindneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HER Love to CHRIST was in a fervent Operation. She expreſt the higheſt Eſteem of Him, the ſtrongeſt Deſire towards Him. Once on Her ſaying, <q>O my precious Saviour, Look on me with an Eye of Pity!</q> — I took Occaſion (with a View to helping Her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern one Evidence of Her Faith in Chriſt,) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat to Her that Scripture, <hi>To Them that believe, He is precious</hi>:— Upon which, She expreſs'd Her admiring ſenſe hereof, ſaying, <q>O how precious! He is altogether lovely!</q> — She ſaid that, <q>The Enjoyment of Chriſt was all Her Deſire. <hi>And that,</hi> This whole World was Nothing, Nothing to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt.</q> And that, <q>If She might but go to be with Chriſt, that wou'd be infinitely better than being here.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, Her <hi>Hope &amp; Confidence in GOD</hi> did not fail. She had liv'd a Life of Dependence
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002218_0051_0FDAD08F1287E198"/>
on GOD &amp; made Him Her Truſt from Her Youth: and She had been begotten to a lively Hope of Salvation. And now the Time was come that She muſt die, She had the Hope of the Righteous and the Peace of the Upright in Her End. She was not indeed one of them who have <hi>no Bands in their Death</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor of that happy Number, who have the full Aſſurance of Faith and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Yet once (I remember) after a long ſilence (when I preſume She had been deeply engag'd in Meditation and Prayer) She ſuddenly open'd Her Eyes and with a kind of Tranſport utter'd theſe Words, <q>Now I have hold of Him, Now I've Hold on him. O let Him never leave me! Let me never loſe my Confidence in him!</q> — Yet the Clouds ſoon return'd after the Rain. Humble Doubts and Fears prevailed; and ſometimes She was in great Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. One wou'd have expected indeed that ſuch on extraordinary Life of Holineſs and Communion with GOD as She had led, ſhou'd have terminated in a moſt comfortable &amp; joyful Death. Yet GOD, who exerciſes a Sovereign Liberty in the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of His Comforts, was pleaſed to order it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with this humble contrite Chriſtian. She was full of ſelf-diffidence &amp; the deepeſt ſelf-abaſement to the laſt: And yet in the midſt of all Her Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and greateſt Diſtreſs, She had Faith in a lively Exerciſe, and ſome mixture of Hope, which was as an Anchor to Her Soul, and kept Her from being over-ſet with her oppreſſive Fear &amp; Grief. She al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways call'd on GOD, as <hi>Her</hi> GOD, with a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Familiarity, and an obſervable Emphaſis. She often uſed theſe Words in the Agonies of Her <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Faith. <q>My GOD help me. My com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002218_0052_0FDAD08310D8D5F0"/>
Father help me. I have truſted in Thee, my GOD; let me never be put to Confuſion. I hope in thee my GOD; let me never be confounded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>ONCE in a continuing Fit of acute Pain, She thus expreſſed Her Truſt in GOD; <q>I am in Pain: What ſhall I do? I am weary with my Groaning all the Day. O Lord, mine Eyes are upon Thee. Lord, ſtrengthen Me. O Lord, my Hope is in Thee; whither elſe ſhould I go? In Thee do I truſt: I have truſted in Thee: I muſt truſt in Thee; and I will. Yea tho' thou ſlayeſt Me, yet will I truſt in Thee.</q> — Which laſt Words (the Words of Holy <hi>Job</hi> in his Affliction) She often uſed. — Under the ſenſe of Her unuſual Darkneſs of Mind and Dullneſs of Affection, Theſe were ſome of the admirable Breathings of Her unſhaken Truſt &amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation; <q>My GOD! Thou hideſt thy Face from me, Thou makeſt me walk in Darkneſs. But I ſubmit: I'm content, I'm content. I am at thine al-wiſe Diſpoſe. I deſire the Light of thy Countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and value it above this whole World: but if Thou ſhalt ſee meet still to hide thy Face from Met, I ſubmit, I ſubmit to thy Holy Will. Only I will yet hope. On Thee my GOD do I wait all the Day long. I hope I ſhall yet praiſe Thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AT another Time (the laſt Opportunity I had of ſpeaking with Her,) She ſeem'd to have a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and chearful Hope: Theſe were ſome of Her Words, <q>I hope in my GOD. O my ſtrong Tower and Defenſe! I hope in Thee, my GOD. I now hope, and this is my Refreſhment.</q> — And again, She ſaid, <q>O my GOD, Thou art my only Hope and Confidence. Thou ſupporteſt and ſtrengtheneſt me, and buildeſt me up in my Faith.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:002218_0053_0FDAD09092823C48"/>AND again, When She was in the apprehenſion of Thoſe about Her, drawing near to the Cloſe of Her Life, My Father to miniſter to Her Support, repeated ſome Part of the 23d Pſalm, and as He was ſaying thoſe Words, <hi>When I walk thro' the Valley of the ſhadow of Death, I will fear no Evil; for thou art with Me,</hi> —. She interrupted Him, and ſupplied the Reſt, ſaying, <q>Thy Rod and thy Staff, they comfort Me —.</q> She was heard to ſay divers Times, <q>Come, come, come: How long, how long?</q> — Thus it ſeems, the Clouds paſſed away at the Approach of Death, and <hi>at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening there was Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I remember, whenever She had any <hi>Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> She was continually ſollicitous leſt She ſhould be deceived. She wou'd often pray, <q>O let not my Hope make Me aſhamed. Let it not be the Hope of the Hypocrite, that ſhall periſh!</q> Tho' once She added, <q>It can't be ſo; I am no Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite: I know I am not</q>. And I think it was upon Her uttering theſe Words (which She did with an Air of Aſſurance uncommon to Her,) that I ask'd Her, Whether <hi>the Hope She had did ſerve ſenſibly to wean Her from this World, and increaſe Her Hatred of Sin, and inflame Her Deſires towards GOD,</hi> &amp;c. And She anſwer'd with Humble Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to GOD, in the <hi>Affirmative.</hi> — I told Her then Her Hope was certainly the <hi>Fruit of the Spirit, a good Hope,</hi> which wou'd not be diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>AND (to add only a Word or two further) She was full of the tendereſt Expreſſions of <hi>Love</hi> to every Body, and very <hi>thankful</hi> to Her Friends for their
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002218_0054_0FDAD08494B41C20"/>
kind Viſits, and for every (the leaſt) Service or Office of Love done by any: And never was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more <hi>lowly-minded</hi>; She was <hi>clothed with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>; She cou'd ſee nothing in Her ſelf, (She ſaid) that ſhou'd deſerve ſuch Love and Reſpect from People, as was ſhown Her, and admir'd what cou'd be the Reaſon of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — But (what is more) She had a <hi>Divine Zeal</hi> in Exerciſe, that put Her upon diſpenſing Holy Counſels, Cautions and Encouragements to all about Her, as was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; which She did with great Fidelity and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as well as Modeſt and Diſcretion. How pathetically did She exhort one &amp; another to <hi>Order Their Converſation as becometh the Goſpel, to watch over Themſelves, to take Heed to Their ways; and walk in the Way of Truth:</hi> adding once this remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable &amp; very moving Expreſſion. <hi>"MY GOD will not be mocked, MY GOD will not be mocked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HER Dying Counſil to Us, Her Children, (which may We never forget!) was that; <q>O take Heed, take Heed; and be diligent to make your Calling and Election ſure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>SHE ſpake to all in General about a <hi>Death-bed-Repentance,</hi> and gave Warning againſt the great but too common Folly of depending on it.</p>
            <p>SHE expreſſed Her ſenſe of the great Importance of <hi>actual</hi> Readineſs for a Dying Hour, and to excite hereto was the Tendency of that Counſil, <q>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet thy God, O Iſrael!</q> — Which were ſome of her laſt Words, and ſpoken with a moſt awful accent and aſpect.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, She was full of <hi>Prayer.</hi> She was praying always in the Holy Ghoſt; being fervent
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:002218_0055_0FDAD092115EF1F8"/>
in Spirit, and with a great Facility pouring out her Deſires (chiefly) in Scripture-Expreſſions; For her Bible was very familiar to Her, She had from a Child known the holy Scriptures, and taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Pains, to treaſure up the Word of GOD in Her Heart &amp; Memory. She was much in Prayer for <hi>Her ſelf,</hi> continually looking to and calling upon GOD in CHRIST for Mercy &amp; Grace to help Her. — She alſo prayed for <hi>Others,</hi> Particularly She left Her Bleſſing on Her <hi>Children</hi>; when we were ſtanding round Her Bed, and calling Her Bleſſed, acknowleging our Obligations to Her, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our deepeſt Sympathy with, as well as du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and ſolemn Wiſhes for Her; She ceaſed not to pray for <hi>Us,</hi> and to bleſs Us in the Name of the Lord, and this not only in General, but in Particular; (not forgetting Thoſe of Her Children that were abſent; and Her Children's Children, even the Children that ſhall be born;) and the laſt Words She was heard to ſay, were thoſe <q>Let my Children Live in Love and Peace; and let the GOD of Love and Peace be with them, for Ever and Ever. Amen!</q>
            </p>
            <p>SHE was very deſirous of the Benefit of other's Prayers with Her and for Her, while Living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>BUT now no longer</hi>! She is got beyond the Reach, and above the Need of our Prayers. She is gone where She is eaſed of all Her Burdens; where Her Sighs are turned into Songs; Her Griefs and Groans into Joy and Praiſe; Her Faith into Viſion; Her Hope into Fruition; Her Grace into Glory. Having born the Croſs on Earth, She now wears the Crown in Heaven: While <hi>We</hi> are left
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002218_0056_0FDAD08694F714A8"/>
behind in Tears, bewailing our Loſs; [a Judgment, I'm humbly ſenſible, (to ſpeak for my ſelf) I was too ripe for,] And <hi>not knowing the Things that ſhall further befall Us.</hi> GOD grant it may not prove ſuch a <hi>Beginning of ſorrows,</hi> as the Death of pious <hi>Rachel</hi> was; upon which the Affliction of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in a few Months enſu'd! We ſhou'd therefore humble our ſelves under the mighty Hand of GOD; and be earneſt with Him in Prayer, that He wou'd not proceed in His Controverſy with Us. — Howbeit, if the Spirit of <hi>Joſeph</hi> (the ſame Spirit of Faith and Patience, of Grace and Supplication) does but reſt upon Us, whatſoever may be <hi>the Evil to come,</hi> though We <hi>ſhould have Sorrow upon Sorrow,</hi> Yet (as <hi>He</hi> ſaid) <hi>GOD means it unto Good.</hi> If We do but patiently bear, and religiouſly improve afflictive Providences, We ſhall find by happy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that <hi>Sorrow is better than Laughter,</hi> which is one of the wiſe Proverbs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> tho' an uncouth Paradox to the carnally-minded: but when GOD has <hi>finiſhed His Work,</hi> the Myſtery will be unriddled. <hi>The Day ſhall declare it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT indeed our Concern <hi>now</hi> is not ſo much, what <hi>ill Events</hi> this Viſitation may be the unhappy Forerunner of, or how We ſhall be able to bear them; as what <hi>good Account</hi> We ſhall be able to give up of our Deportment under and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>preſent Affliction,</hi> and how We ſhall apply it to make Us better prepar'd for the <hi>next,</hi> whatever it be. — O that We may have Wiſdom and Grace to demean our ſelves aright under this heavy Trial, and accommodate our ſelves to the Intentions of Providence herein; ſo that tho' <hi>We</hi> are Loſers in our Comforts, yet <hi>GOD</hi> may be a
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002218_0057_0FDAD093913FAA28"/>
Gainer in His Glory! O that We may never forget the wiſe Leſſons We've been taught, or loſe the holy Impreſſions (I hope) We have received, by this mournful Diſpenſation! O that hereby our Hearts may be more <hi>looſen'd</hi> from all Earthly Friendſhips and Enjoyments! That CHRIST (our beſt and never-failing Friend) may be more <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd</hi> to us; and our Affections more ſet upon the Things that are unſeen and Eternal! O that We may be made more <hi>thoughtful of Death &amp; Judgment,</hi> and be quickned in our Preparations therefor! O that We may be <hi>learning from the Example</hi> of our dear Deceaſed Friend and Parent, how to <hi>Live,</hi> and how to <hi>Die</hi>! She was <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> thro' Her Life, and the ſame at Death; and theſe are the two great Characters; which ſpeak the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian acceptable to GOD and entituled to Heaven. What tho' She had not that fullneſs of Hope &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Her End; but after all Her Diligence to make Her Calling and Election ſure, was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Doubts and Fears, when She came to die. We muſt not, becauſe of This, doom it a vain Thing to take Pains in working out our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, nor be diſcouraged from a Life of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. <hi>For</hi> (Remember) <hi>the Cloud had a bright ſide</hi>; and notwithſtanding all Her Darkneſs, She made a <hi>glorious End</hi>; being in the midſt of her greateſt Temptations &amp; Diſtreſſes, full of Faith &amp; humble Hope, fervent Love, Prayer and Praiſe. And truly it is worth the while to Live over Her ſtrict and holy Life, that We may die Her happy Death, and our laſt End be like Her's. — Let us labour then to get our Souls inſpir'd with a noble Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and fir'd with a generous Ambition to <hi>be</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:002218_0058_0FDAD08794967648"/>
and <hi>do</hi> like Her. Let us covet to <hi>equal,</hi> and if it be poſſible to <hi>excel</hi> Her in all that was imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both in Her Life and Death. We have the ſame Spirit of Grace to aſſiſt Us, and the ſame Recompence of Reward to allure Us; and what can We deſire more? — Conſider, If we (Her Children) ſerve the Lord &amp; do Worthily in Iſrael, We may perhaps inherit more of the Good &amp; Grace of the Covenant, than She; as <hi>Jacob's Bleſſings prevail'd above the Bleſſings of his Progenitors.</hi> This Conſideration ſhou'd induce Us to be Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Her excellent Pattern. And it ſhou'd alſo be a moving Argument with Us, that this will greatly redound to Her Honour, as well as ours, When there is an <hi>Entail</hi> of Religion upon Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity; It is indeed a <hi>bleſſed and glorious thing</hi>; This Religious Succeſſion puts a living Beauty and Luſtre on the <hi>Name and Race.</hi> But a very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Dignity is put on the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>grand</hi> Parents, who were the <hi>Beginning</hi> of this noble and happy Stock. <q>It was the great Glory of <hi>Abraham,</hi> next to his being the Friend of GOD, that he was <hi>the Father of the Faithful.</hi>
               </q> This honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character makes his Name <hi>Shine</hi> in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Story, and endears his Memory to univerſal Poſterity; and it will be none of the leaſt of his Honours in the Day of the <hi>Manifeſtation of the Sons of GOD,</hi> to appear as the common Head to a numerous and glorious Offspring; and to be able to ſay, <hi>Lo! Here am I, and the Children which thou haſt graciouſly given thy Servant!</hi>
