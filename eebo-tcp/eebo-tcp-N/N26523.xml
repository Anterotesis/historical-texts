            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>TO embalm, by offerings of tributary monuments, the memory of the wiſe, the valiant, the good, and the great, is a cuſtom co-eval with the hiſtory of man. Nor is this cuſtom leſs honourable and praiſe-worthy, from its nature, than venerable, from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of its high antiquity. Whether we view it, in its relationſhip to the cultivation of private virtues, or to the promotion of public good, its objects are highly intereſting and important. They are, to fan in our breaſts the flame of friendſhips threatened with extinction by the damps of death, to add perpetuity to ſentiments of gratitude for diſtinguiſhed ſervices, to cheriſh in our boſoms a love of exalted worth, and to allure us on to virtuous conduct, through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of our conſtitutional propenſity to imitation, and by the powerful motives of emulation and the love of praiſe.</p>
            <p>For theſe purpoſes have the rude but energetic ſongs of the bards and minſtrels, of old, reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—for theſe purpoſes have temples and other archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectural monuments been erected in honour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted heroes—for theſe purpoſes has the chiſſel of the ſkilful ſtatuary been plied—for theſe purpoſes has
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035262_0004_1001B3785059CA80"/>
the pencil of the painter been exerciſed—for theſe purpoſes have the pens of the hiſtorian and biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher been employed—and, for theſe purpoſes has the voice of the eulogiſt been heard—Allow me to add, for theſe purpoſes have we aſſembled on the preſent intereſting, but mournful, occaſion!—</p>
            <p>Death, my fellow members, has, not long ſince, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded our inſtitution, and ſwept off one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed of our colleagues!—The name of Coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is ſtill alike dear and familiar to moſt of you, though he, who bore that name, has ſunk, with all his virtues, to an untimely grave!—But I renounce the unfounded thought, and retract the unwelcome and injurious aſſertion!—Though our ineſtimable col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league has himſelf, diſappeared, it is not ſo with his numerous virtues! They ſtill remain, a guardian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation—a glittering galaxy, to light his ſurviving friends, on the dark and intricate journey of life!— Thus were the pious ſages of the eaſt, originally appriſed of the birth of the Meſſiah, and afterwards conducted on their way to do him homage, by a bright and ſupernumerary ſtar in the heavens!— Though ſnatched away by a ſudden and unexpected ſtroke, this amiable young philoſopher has not left us without a fair and authentic teſtimonial of his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regard! We have even become his heirs— He has bounteouſly bequeathed to us his character and example—a legacy, as far ſuperior to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bequeſts of men, as moral excellence ſurpaſſes the value of periſhable matter; or, as the beauty of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſurpaſſes the beauty of material objects! Mine is the melancholy, yet not unwelcome taſk, to examine
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035262_0005_1001B37B601BA678"/>
well the contents of this legacy; to endeavour to appreciate each ſeparate article of the treaſure it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, and exhibit a detailed ſtatement of the whole, that you may, then, with the more facility, arrive at an eſtimate of its real worth—To drop the language of metaphor, I am called on, by your ſuffrages, to ſpeak what I know, reſpecting the general character of our deceaſed friend.</p>
            <p>As the field, on which I am about to enter, abounds with the choiceſt flowers and fruits of intellect and morality, you will pardon me ſhould I leave it with much reluctance. But it is not more rich and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than extenſive and capacious. For though our friend and colleague did not, in age, complete his twenty-ſeventh year, in ſcientific acquirements, in rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of principle, and in acts of benevolence and virtue, he had already attained an advanced longevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let my reluctance, then, to loſe ſight of a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſo fair and enchanting, as that exhibited by the character of the gentleman, whoſe worth we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate, be received as an apology, for any unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentional treſpaſs I may commit on your patience.</p>
            <p>In your late reſolution to perpetuate, by an eulogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, the memory of Dr. Cooper, you have done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual honour to me, to yourſelves, to genius, to ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to morality, to religion, and to the healing art.</p>
            <p>You have done honour to me, by the appointment which your flattering partiality has aſſigned me: you have done honour to yourſelves, by avowing your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable attachment to diſtinguiſhed excellence: you
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035262_0006_1001AE0248F8BCD8"/>
have done honour to genius, by an attempt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from the ſhades of oblivion, one who poſſeſſed an uncommon ſhare of this firſt of endowments: you have done honour to ſcience, by paying due reſpect to the memory of one, who would ſhortly have been ranked among its brighteſt ornaments: you have done honour to morality, by doing homage to a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter formed on the baſis of its pureſt principles: you have done honour to religion, by a reſpectful tribute to the worth of a young philoſopher, whose life was a ſeries of conduct conformable to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: and you have done honour to the healing art, by making honourable and worthy mention of one, who had ſpent many toilſome years in its cultivation, and whoſe talents and induſtry would have raiſed him, in time, to a level with the moſt exalted medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal characters of the age.</p>
            <p>Dr. Cooper was a native of the ſtate of Maryland. He was born in Talbot county, on the Eaſtern Shore, on the 8th of September, 1772. Amid the fields and foreſts, in the neighbourhood of this place, did he imbibe, from early obſervation, the rudiments of that knowledge of nature, which he afterwards cultivated with ſuch induſtry and ſucceſs. Though himſelf the only ſurviving individual of his family, he, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, retained and exhibited, through the whole of his life, the moſt reſpectful and affectionate attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the place of his birth, being alſo the place where the relics of his forefathers and kinſmen were depoſited. Reſpecting the parentage of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed colleague, my knowledge is extremely limited and defective. As his pre-eminent modeſty kept him
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035262_0007_1001B3861B7ED180"/>
for ever ſilent on ſubjects that bore relation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I never, during the whole of our acquaintance, received from him, a ſingle article of information re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting his deſcent and family connections. I well know, however, that he poſſeſſed neither the right nor the inclination, to avail himſelf of that moſt empty and unmeaning of all boaſts, a long and ſplendid line of anceſtry. As far as I have been able to learn, his parents were remarkable for nothing except their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, their induſtry, and the general decorum and rectitude of their conduct. No uncommon blaze of parental genius, no glitterring pomp of accidental riches, no towering pride of family alliances, no lengthened catalogue of anceſtral greatneſs, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to add an artificial luſtre to the birth of our young philoſopher. Like the fair ſtar of the morning, ſpringing from the boſom of the darkeſt hour, he roſe to what he was, from the lap of obſcurity. Nor let the <hi>haughty</hi> and the high-born, thoſe ſlaves to conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous deſcent, and titled greatneſs, conſider his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability and merit as diminiſhed by this—Let ſuch remember, that to the humble valley, no leſs than to the cloud-capt mountain, are many of our moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and majeſtic ſtreams indebted for their origin. Who, in gazing on the brilliancy of the diamond, can ſuffer the darkneſs of the matrix, where its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were matured, to throw, in imagination, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſhadow over its luſtre?—Or who, on ſurveying the majeſty of the oak, that exults in its ſtrength, and towers aloft, the glory of the foreſt, can conſider its grandeur as, in any meaſure, diminiſhed by the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the acorn from which it ſprang?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:035262_0008_1001B38C44B49318"/>As my acquaintance with our fellow-member, whoſe worth we commemorate, did not commence till his arrival at manhood, I am diſqualified for being a minute biographer of his earlier years. I am una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to aſcend, hiſtorically, to the period of his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when his obſervation was gradually awakening to the beauties, the harmonies, and the contraſts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. I will not undertake to portray to you, from poſitive anecdote, the impreſſive wonder with which he, at firſt, viewed the general fabric of viſible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation—the delight he derived from an immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of ſurrounding bodies—nor the ſilent rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with which he ſurveyed the diſtant expanſe of the ſtarry heavens! His ſenſations, when firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to an interview with the more bold and ſublime ſcenes of nature—when the heavens were involved in a dark and tumultuous covering of clouds—when all nature ſeemed immerſed in a depth of expectation and ſolicitude, on account of the impending elementary convulſion—when, at length, the fierce lightning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dart, in all directions, its dreadful coruſcations, and the mingled roar of tempeſt and of thunder to be, every moment, reiterated in his ears—the ſenſations, I ſay, of our young philoſopher, on ſuch an intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion as this, conſtitute a ſubject of which it is not my deſign to attempt a deſcription. Allow me, however, to obſerve, that they muſt have been ſuch, as could be experienced only, by a young mind of ſuperior ſtrength and conſummate ſenſibility—a mind exquiſitely formed for the enjoyment of that pleaſure, ariſing from the contemplation of objects of grandeur and ſublimity. I can, at leaſt, very confidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035262_0009_1001B390DF285568"/>
that, when arrived at manhood. Dr. Cooper poſſeſſed a mind peculiarly adapted to the enjoyment of this ſuperior deſcription of pleaſure—a mind, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to liſten, with that of the minſtrel of Beattie, <q>with pleaſing dread, to the deep roar of the wide-weltering waves;</q> or, with that of Shakeſpear, to exult in the whirlwind, and enjoy the ſtorm!</p>
            <p>The progreſs, which our deceaſed friend made, in the cultivation and evolution of his intellectual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, are points, which I will, in like manner, paſs over in ſilence. I will not attempt to trace the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of his mind through all its infinitude of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations from his early infancy, when it was but little —perhaps, I might even ſay, nothing more than a ſenſitive germ, till that period of maturity in which it became capable of the moſt glowing conception, and the moſt powerful exertion of philoſophic thought. In vain would I attempt to point to the time, when his opening imagination commenced its ſportive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, to collect materials for its future ſcenes of mimic creation—and, in vain, to the time, when his underſtanding began to diſcern and diſcriminate, and his reaſon to unravel, by degrees, its ſlender and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate thread of induction. Theſe are themes of refinement, which I am obliged to reſign to a better informed, a more metaphyſical, and more deſcriptive pen.</p>
            <p>The particulars of Dr. Cooper's early ſcholaſtic education, in the country, are wholly unknown to me. Being unacquainted with himſelf, at this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing period of life, and having, ſince, had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035262_0010_1001B39701FA9398"/>
of any of his teachers, patrons, or ſchool-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, I am conſtrained to leave a blank in this part of his biography. If we may judge, however, of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as a ſtudent, at this, from that which he bore at a ſubſequent period, he was equally diſtinguiſhed for the intenſity of his application to ſtudy, the amiability of his manners, the decorum of his general deportment, and the accuracy and rapidity of his literary acquire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It may not be amiſs, however, to obſerve, that there, not unfrequently, exiſts between the early and ſubſequent periods of the lives of illuſtrious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, the moſt ſtriking diſſimilitude both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their habits of ſtudy, and the evidences of talents which they exhibit to the world. Thus, even the celebrated Dean Swift was once conſidered by his ſchool-fellows and teachers, as an incorrigible block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; the ſuppoſed ſtupidity of the great Newton himſelf, the illuſtrious father of aſtronomic philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, procured for him, on firſt entering the univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the nick-name of "The Calf;" and the afterwards laborious and learned Gibbon, was pointed at, in the earlier part of his life, as a perfect paragon of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſſipation.</p>
            <p>When of feeble and tender age, and wholly inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the taſk of ſelf-direction, young Cooper had the misfortune to be deprived of both his parents. On the occurrence of this event, our minor was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to the guardianſhip of Mr. John Needles, a gentleman, whoſe name alone, conſtitutes the only article in his hiſtory, reſpecting which I poſſeſs any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Thus circumſtanced, before precept and example had fully formed and eſtabliſhed his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035262_0011_1001B39A14381DF0"/>
of conduct—before obſervation and experience had furniſhed him with knowledge, or reaſon had lighted up her lamp for the direction of his ſteps, the ſituation of our young friend was critical and perilous. Suddenly caſt on the fathomleſs and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ocean of life, with the ſyren-voice of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pleaſure, for ever melodiouſly vibrating in his ear, and no venerable Mentor to conduct him, in ſafety, to the wiſhed-for Utica of virtue, dark and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious, at beſt, were his proſpects of future celebrity and happineſs! But no ſituation, however perilous and unfavourable, in appearance, can juſtify our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to a ſpirit of deſpondency. Fortune is ever changeful, and may, in the ceaſeleſs revolution of events, give birth to ſomething unexpectedly auſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Such was her conduct to our young philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. Though ſhe appeared to frown, malignantly, on his earlier years, ſhe favoured him with her ſmiles, at a ſubſequent period. In his paſſage through life, he acquired, by the mildneſs of his diſpoſition, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive gentleneſs and modeſty of his manners, and the general rectitude of his deportment, friends and patrons, whoſe converſation and advice, ſupplied, in a great meaſure, the want of parental admonition and example.</p>
            <p>In the year eighty-ſix, being, then, in the fourteenth year of his age, young Cooper was removed, by his guardian, to Philadelphia, for the purpoſe of complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his claſſical education. Here he had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be placed under the auſpices of a chartered ſcholaſtic inſtitution, the moſt ancient of the kind in the ſtate, yet not more venerable, from its age, than
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035262_0012_1001AE20EEDA8990"/>
reſpectable, from its good government and extenſive utility. I allude to the Friends' public grammar ſchool, taught, at that time, by Mr. Robert Proud, a gentleman, whoſe qualifications, as a teacher, can receive no additional reſpectability or luſtre, by any thing that can reſult from the efforts of my pen. Mr. Proud is a character, whoſe unaccommodating ſincerity and attachment to truth, are well known to prevent him alike from cenſuring unjuſtly the faults of his enemies, or beſtowing unmerited praiſes on the excellencies of his friends. Nor is he, perhaps, ſecond to any one, in his powers for the diſcovery of youthful merit. To acquire the particular friendſhip of ſuch a teacher, and to be ſpoken of by him in terms of the higheſt applauſe, muſt be alike grateful to the feelings of a pupil, and evidential of his being poſſeſſed of ſuperior worth. Such a pledge was it the good fortune of our colleague to receive and retain. Mr. Proud was his inalterable friend when living— He faithfully watched and recorded, in his memory, his numerous virtues as they opened, and does not ceaſe to dwell on them now, as a juſt and grateful tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his memory when dead.</p>
            <p>Dr. Cooper continued a pupil in the grammar ſchool, in Philadelphia, till ſome time in the autumn of the year ninety. During this period he was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſhed for his ſtudious habits, his decorum of behaviour, and the eaſe and rapidity of his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the various branches of ſcholaſtic literature. Beſides the acquiſition of a very liberal acquaintance with geography, mathematics, hiſtory, and natural philoſophy, he became ſo perfectly maſter of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035262_0013_1001B3A65B4C0D68"/>
French, and Greek languages (particularly of the two former) as to write and converſe in them with elegance and eaſe. I believe I am correct in aſſerting, that, in point of ſcholaſtic and philoſophical acquirements, he ſtood alone, the pride, the boaſt (I had almoſt ſaid) the idol, of the inſtitution!</p>
            <p>But the reſources of his genius were, by no means, expended on the ſtudy of the claſſics. Poſſeſſed of an imagination towering, active, fertile, and creative— an imagination bright and fervid as a ſun-beam, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extenſive in its range with the land-marks of creation, his mind was not to be impriſoned in the narrow cloiſter of ſcholaſtic learning. With a native and ſtrong predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for works of fancy, he faithfully devoted his hours of amuſement to the cultivation of an intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the writings of the poets. No puerile attachment to giddy and unmeaning ſports—no diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated propenſity to the idle amuſements and diſſipation of the times—no criminal purſuit of forbidden plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ever diverted his attention from its favourite channel. Inſtead of dexterouſly ſpinning the well-poiſed top, or following, with his eye, the poliſhed marble rolling along the pavements of our ſtreets, he choſe to purſue, with the illuſtrious Newton, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies revolving on high, in their ſpacious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. Inſtead of conſuming his hours in the lap of apathy and idleneſs—inſtead of participating, with a circle of diſſolute companions, in ſhameful and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcenes of immorality and vice, he choſe to ſoar, with his beloved Milton, through the haunts of angels, to the throne of the Deity—to deſcend, in imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the infernal regions, and ſurvey the glooms,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035262_0014_1001B3AAF54BB8F8"/>
the torments, and the horrors of the place, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with Homer, Virgil, and Fenelon—or to unravel the mazes of the nature and character of man, with Horace, Juvenal, Shakeſpear, and Pope. But his amuſements did not conſiſt ſolely in traverſing the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior regions of poetry; he would oftentimes, in his more gay and ſportive moments, deſcend to liſten to the ſhrill and piercing notes of the harp of Gray—to enjoy the melody of the tuneful Waller's lute—to dwell enraptured on the voice of the muſe of Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—or ſtray enchanted through the fairy regions of the deſcriptive Spencer!</p>
            <p>Such were the elegant and rational amuſements, which occupied, during the earlier part of his life, the leiſure hours of him whoſe virtues we have met to commemorate. But he did not remain ſatisfied with cultivating, and regaling his taſte for the poetical beauties contained in the writings of others. Such an end was, by far, too groveling for his literary am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. Nor was that ambition deſtitute of the aid of talents, fully adequate to its gratification. Born with a genius almoſt equally competent to every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of literary exertion, he, not unfrequently, indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his imagination in the moſt chaſte and elegant ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of poetry. Many of theſe productions, of our young bard and philoſopher, were publiſhed, under fictitious names, in the different prints of the city, and were ſought after, with avidity, by readers of taſte. As a farther evidence of his acquirements in literature, it is but juſtice to obſerve, that ſeveral of theſe were clothed in pure, correct, and claſſical Latin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:035262_0015_1001AE30375563D8"/>It will hereafter appear, that, at a ſubſequent peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, when time had fully evolved his muſe's pinions, and farther experience had emboldened her flights, he gave birth to ſeveral poems, which might have been owned, without a bluſh, by the pen of a Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, a Pope, or a Darwin. Nor were his talents in writing, confined to poetry alone; his proſe compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were no leſs remarkable for exterior beauty and ſubſtantial merit.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In corroboration of this fact, I had the pleaſure to receive, by requeſt, from Dr. Ruſh, the following note, which I here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join by ſpecial permiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>So high was the opinion entertained of Dr. Cooper's correct taſte and judgment in the Engliſh language, that one of the oldeſt of his preceptors in medicine, Dr. Ruſh, ſubmitted the laſt volume of his Medical Inquiries and Obſervations, to his criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, before he committed it to the preſs.</q>
                  </p>
               </note> Their excellence conſiſted in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of matter and richneſs of ſentiment, combined with perſpicuity, elegance, and energy of expreſſion. His talents for deſcriptive narration were particularly bold, glowing, and happy. Here it was that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to tower above himſelf. Having command of a ſtyle highly animated, but not extravagant; rich, but not exuberant; lofty, but not bombaſtic; figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, yet neither ſtudied nor affected; and full, yet not degenerating into ſuperfluous verboſity—he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, in a degree to which few writers have preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the art of giving to his ſubject the figure, the colouring, I had almoſt ſaid, the motions of life.— Such were the effects of ſtudious habits, contracted at an early period of life, on the mental accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of him whoſe premature death we ſo juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035262_0016_1001B3B741179638"/>
While others, of his age, were engaged in purſuit of evaneſcent pleaſures, in parties, at balls, at concerts, or at the theatre, he, in his cloſet, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by the writings of poets, philoſophers, and ſages, and zealous in the inveſtigation of ſome favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite ſubject, was in the actual enjoyment of that more rational and permanent pleaſure, ariſing from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of truth, and the cultivation of the ſeveral powers of the mind. They, like the gaudy, ſportive, and improvident tribes, that hover around the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but periſhable ſweets of a flower, remained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the enjoyment of the preſent moment; while he, like that well-known inſect, which nature would ſeem to have created as a model of wiſdom and induſtry, devoted his time to the accumulation of a ſtore for future enjoyment, which nothing but the hand of death could exhauſt!</p>
            <p>As the period of Dr. Cooper's continuance at the grammar-ſchool of this place, was that in which his mental powers began to be unfolded, like an intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Eden, to the minds of his acquaintance, it may not be amiſs, on the preſent occaſion, to attempt, at leaſt, to make them paſs in bright, but brief, review before you.</p>
            <p>Here would ſeem, indeed, to be the threſhold of my toils! Here do I become duly ſenſible of the weight of my ſubject! Here its difficulties thicken and magnify to my view, like Alps rearing their creſts over Alps, till even hope becomes almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, and enterprize diſheartened at the arduous proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.—Where! Tell me, ye choice and favoured ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035262_0017_1001B3BEE76BB878"/>
whoſe faculties of utterance move in nice and perfect accordance to your powers of conception, where ſhall I find a mirror of expreſſion, to furniſh an adequate repreſentation of ſuch a ſplendid aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage of faculties, as that exhibited by the mind of our departed friend! Could I, like the prophet of old, but have caught the ſkirt of his mantle, as he aſcended! Could I now invoke to my aid but one ray of that genius, by which he was illuminated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired—then, indeed, would I feel ſome degree of confidence in myſelf—then would I venture to indulge the pleaſing hope, of being followed, by your appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, in my deſcent from this place, to which I have been raiſed by your flattering ſuffrage!</p>
            <p>The mind of Dr. Cooper, as far as relates to the hiſtory of its phyſical powers, would appear to have involved, in its conſtitution, little leſs than an abſolute contradiction. Among its aſſemblage of brilliant and valuable qualities, it embraced ſuch as have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppoſed to be hoſtile and incompatible. While it poſſeſſed, in an eminent degree, the properties of the world-deſcrying teleſcope, it was, by no means, a ſtranger to thoſe of the microſcope. While it ſhone a Herſchel, in its capacious range, and boundleſs comprehenſion, it was, no leſs, a Leewenhoek, in its painful and accurate examination of the minutiae of matter. Exquiſite in its ſenſibility, and nice in its perception, no phyſical object, however inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, could be preſented, nor any phenomenon occur, without giving riſe to an appropriate impreſſion, or exciting a correſponding exerciſe of thought. Like the well-poiſed needle, tremblingly alive to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035262_0018_1001B3C54F1CA318"/>
of the pole, his mind appeared to poſſeſs a conſtitutional bent and affinity to truth. Nor was this affinity under the government of quantity, ſo much as of quality. It was called into action by truths the moſt minute, no leſs than by thoſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior magnitude.</p>
            <p>It has been already obſerved that Dr. Cooper's ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination was ſo enterprizing and powerful, as, occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, to accompany his muſe in the loftieſt flights. It might be ſaid, like the poet's eye, to range "from heaven to earth and from earth to heaven," collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing fair and valuable in its way. But it was not left to its own wild, deſultory excurſions, like a tempeſt-driven veſſel, without a pilot and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a helm. It was ever reined in, and governed, by a ſolid and luminous underſtanding, and corrected by the moſt delicate and accurate taſte.</p>
            <p>Nor was his capacity for reaſoning at all inferior to his other intellectual powers. For ever tracing, with nice diſcernment, and uncommon facility, the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relations and connections between propoſitions or things, it ſeldom failed to conduct him to fair and happy concluſions. In reaſoning, what was to others toilſome and fatiguing, appeared, with him, but plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and amuſement.</p>
            <p>His memory was a capacious and faithful repoſitory of facts, opinions, and principles. It was fed through the avenues of all his ſenſes, for each ſenſe was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſubſervient to the information of his mind. So comprehenſive was it as to admit every thing intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035262_0019_1001B3CB743F03E8"/>
from whatever quarter, and ſo faithfully tenacious, as ſeldom or never to loſe a uſeful fact or truth, by which it had, once, been duly impreſſed. In a word, his obſervation and induſtry had collected, and his memory gave reception to, an inconceivable volume of materials, to be arranged, ſyſtemized, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to their proper purpoſes, by the other kindred powers of his mind.</p>
            <p>Thus, ſuperlatively eminent, in its expanſion and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and nicely balanced, in all its powers, the mind of Dr. Cooper was to be reſpected as the dwelling-place of genius. This divine endowment does not appear to conſiſt, as has been ſuſpected by ſome, in an additional or ſupernumerary faculty of the mind, to be denominated, a ſenſe of truth, and repreſenting, in miniature, the immediate intuition of the Deity. Such velocity is there, however, in the movements of genius—with ſuch rapidity and eaſe does it bound from truth to truth, and from principle to principle, moſt perfectly comprehending each, yet dwelling long on none, that the exiſtence of ſuch an opinion is, by no means, extraordinary. This firſt gift of heaven would ſeem to be the reſult of an exquiſite degree of mental ſenſibility, a talent for extenſive, rapid, and accurate obſervation; a capacious and retentive mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory; a lively, ſtrong, and enterprizing imagination; a clear and profound underſtanding; and vigorous and active powers of reaſon, all nicely balanced, and reciprocally aiding each other in the diſcovery of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:035262_0020_1001B3D1976165B8"/>By the balance of the mental powers, I mean, that they ſhould all be equal in point of ſtrength and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the one not characterized by exceſs, nor the others by deficiency. Like the different parts of a well-finiſhed edifice, they ſhould ſupport, ſtrengthen, and ornament each other. Thus, the man, whoſe mind is nothing but an entire blaze of imagination, can, by no means, be ſaid to be in poſſeſſion of genius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor can he, whoſe imagination is weak, or phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically dull, though his other powers be of the moſt exalted grade. The ſame thing muſt be ſaid of him, whatever be the perfection of his imagination, his memory, and his underſtanding, who is incapable of rapidly advancing to general truths, by the aid of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and intermediate propoſitions. The man of real ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius poſſeſſes a mind that can, at once, feel, perceive, obſerve, retain, diſtinguiſh, ſoar, and combine, and that can perform all theſe functions, in a manner the moſt perfect—Though ſuch a mind muſt be eſteemed a phoenix, no leſs in rarity than in beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; yet ſuch was the mind of our departed col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league!</p>
            <p>Beneath the auſpices, and amid the numerous lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raty advantages of Philadelphia, the intellect of our young friend diſcloſed its reſources, with a rapidity, and acquired, finally, a degree of expanſion, ſtrength, and activity, to which, under circumſtances, leſs fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, it could never have attained. Had it been ſuffered to remain ſequeſtered, in a diſtant and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure part of the country, where the orb of ſcience ſheds, at beſt, but a faint and ſickly gleam, its pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers might have lain for ever dormant and undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035262_0021_1001B3D941001E68"/>
by the world, for want of adequate cauſes to rouſe them into action. Thus lies the diamond embedded in the rock, its value unknown, and its luſtre unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, till the ſkilful hand of the lapidary reſcues it from its impriſonment, and uſhers it to the world for ornament and for uſe. Thus lies the marble, a crude and ſhapeleſs maſs, till, touched by the magic chiſſel of the ſtatuary, it ſprings erect, with the beauty and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of the human form. And, thus, beneath the raging of the wintry elements, lies, cold and torpid, the vegetable embryo, till, awakened into life by the voice of ſpring, it expands its tender leaves and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a harbinger and pledge of its impending fertility!</p>
            <p>In the autumn of the year ninety, young Cooper left the grammar ſchool in this city, by the direction of his guardian, and returned to Maryland, with a view to engage in the ſtudy of a profeſſion. His loſs was much and ſincerely regretted, by a very reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acquaintance, who followed him, to his retreat in the country, with the moſt cordial expreſſions of friendſhip and affection. Nor was this an occurrence at all unexpected. For ſuch was his general charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and deportment, that to know, and admire him, were events inſeparably and neceſſarily connected.</p>
            <p>Sometime in the year ninety-one, he entered on his medical ſtudies, in his native ſtate, under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr. Martin, a gentleman whoſe eſteem and confidence he very ſoon acquired, and of whom I have always heard him ſpeak in terms the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful. In ninety-two he returned to Philadelphia, on an invitation from the managers of the Pennſylvania
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035262_0022_1001B3DF5EBC6C68"/>
hoſpital, and, on the 28th of Auguſt, in the ſame year, entered as an apprentice to that celebrated, and benevolent inſtitution—an inſtitution, which reflects equal honour on its original founders, and on thoſe, who, at the preſent day, conduct it with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate wiſdom and fidelity!</p>
            <p>Here our young friend found himſelf in a ſituation admirably calculated to exerciſe, and rear to full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, every bright and amiable quality of his mind. The ancient and venerable manſion, where he reſided, encloſed by a maſſy wall, and overſhadowed by lofty trees, prepared, in appearance, to bid defiance to the ſhock of ages, impreſſed his mind with ſenſations of ſolemnity, favourable to the contemplation and recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truths of nature. Nor were the beſt ſources wanting for the ſupply of ſuch truths. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a large and choice collection of books, on every branch of phyſical ſcience, immerſed in walks well ſuited for the purpoſes of obſervation and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſurrounded by numerous objects of diſtreſs, claiming equally his attention and ſkill as a phyſician, and philoſopher, and his ſympathy and ſoothing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, as a man; he found ample ſcope for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all his intellect and benevolence. Nor did he ſuffer either the powers of his head, or the virtues of his heart, to contract the cankering ruſt of indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Ever buſied in purſuits of ſcience, of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or of humanity, his life was a perpetual circle of action. Except during his hours of repoſe, which were but few, and when engaged in familiar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with his friends, his mind was but ſeldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in the luxury of relaxation. To him the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035262_0023_1001B3E708637600"/>
of the city preſented no attractions. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premely intent on acquiring knowledge, and on doing good, he found no time to beſtow on ſuch uſeleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. His buſineſs way ſtudy, his pleaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from the alleviation of human miſery, and his amuſement conſiſted in the cultivation of polite litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but, more particularly, in frequenting the haunts of the muſes. It may not, perhaps, be deemed inadmiſſible to obſerve, that, during the whole time of his apprenticeſhip to the Pennſylvania hoſpital, he attended the theatre but twice, both times in complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to my importunity. His firſt viſit was, to be preſent at the performance of Shakeſpear's celebrated tragedy of Othello; and his ſecond, at that of the Revenge, by Dr. Young. Though ſtruck by the brilliancy and elegance of the ſcenery of the ſtage, and delighted with the ſublimity of ſentiment, and energy of expreſſion, which characterize thoſe two monuments of genius, his enjoyment was, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, mingled with much regret, that talents, which might be employed for the important purpoſe of ameliorating the condition of man, ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to evaporate in theatrical declamation!</p>
            <p>Of the attention and ability, with which he diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his numerous and arduous offices, as an appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the hoſpital, the united applauſe of the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and phyſicians of that benevolent inſtitution, conſtitute the moſt reſpectable degree of teſtimony. Never were the duties of that appointment performed with greater tenderneſs, fidelity, and ſkill, than when it was filled by our deceaſed colleague. But this fact does not, for its authenticity, reſt, excluſively, on
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035262_0024_1001B3EB9F305448"/>
the evidence with which we are furniſhed by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers and phyſicians: it is ſtill farther ſubſtantiated, by the ſpontaneous reports, and heart-felt effuſions, of many individuals, who, during his apprenticeſhip, found an aſſylum from death, within the walls of the hoſpital. Long will theſe characters, with gratitude, remember, and long will they continue to declare to the world, with what ſkill and ſolicitude he combated their diſeaſes; and, with what a friendly and unweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hand, he held to their view the all-ſupporting mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of hope. Nor will this be the amount of their tributary evidence—Often will they forego the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and faſhionable topics of converſation, to ſpeak of the times, when, as he paſſed along the wards, whoſe very breezes were the vehicle of ſighs, and whoſe walls had been long the melancholy manſion of the echo of diſtreſs—oftentimes, I ſay, will they delight to tell, how, under ſuch circumſtances, the benignity of his addreſs, and the ſympathy of his manners, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the impreſſion of their ruthleſs maladies, and lulled, for a while, their agonies to reſt! Thus, amid the wild diſorder of a troubled ocean, does oil, diffuſed over the ſurface of the water, afford a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary reſpite to the convulſions of the deep!</p>
            <p>But thoſe within the walls, where he reſided, were not the only objects who experienced his beneficence and humanity. The out-patients of the hoſpital were, at that time, numerous, and widely diſperſed through the city and liberties. I will venture to affirm, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any wiſh to throw a ſhade over the merits of his predeceſſors, that his exertions, for alleviating the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of theſe indigent applicants, were unprecedented
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035262_0025_1001B3F5670E7D48"/>
in the annals of the inſtitution which he ſerved. Of this deſcription of patients he viſited upwards of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, during the two laſt years of his apprenticeſhip. Nor did he attend them with that cold indifference, which, too generally, characterizes the actions of man, when directed to objects of wretchedneſs and charity. Painfully ſenſible to their ſufferings and wants, he was a ſtranger to that counterfeit humanity, which evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates in the empty parade and profeſſions of ſympathy. Leaving to others the ſuſpicious practice of announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, in words, their benevolent and charitable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, he ſpoke, by his actions, the reality of his feelings. When called on to adminiſter relief in the line of his profeſſion, his exertions were paramount to every difficulty. Neither the inclemency of the weather, nor the untimelineſs of the hour, could operate as barriers to the accompliſhment of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. The ſtream of humanity, iſſuing from the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſervoir of his heart, was neither to be congealed by the wintry blaſt, nor evaporated to dryneſs by the ſummer blaze! Fed by a tributary ſtreamlet from every fibre in his ſyſtem, it could be exhauſted, only, with the termination of his life! There ſtands ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a hovel of indigence in the neighbourhood of the hoſpital (and the ſame thing may be ſaid of many at a diſtance) that does not exhibit ſome memorial of his ſkill, as a phyſician, and of his humanity, as a man. Such was the labour and aſſiduity with which he attended theſe objects of penury and misfortune, that the temporary loſs of his own health was not unfrequently the painful conſequence. In his toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome rounds, to adminiſter to theſe paupers gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itous relief, he was lighted on his way by the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035262_0026_1001B3FD0FB5D1F0"/>
fires of the night, perhaps, not much leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qently than by the orb of day. But for this, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was high and enviable: it was nothing leſs than a conſcious enjoyment of the heaven-born "luxury of doing good!"—a reward, denied to all except to minds of true benevolence! Allow me to add, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for the enjoyment of which, no mind was more perfectly calculated—no mind poſſeſſed a more exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite reliſh, than that of our friend, whom we this day commemorate!</p>
            <p>So wiſe and economical was Dr. Cooper's diviſion and appropriation of time, that, notwithſtanding the wide and diverſified ſcene of his active engagements, he ſtill found leiſure for cultivating the field of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſcience. To the diviſions of chemiſtry, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hiſtory (including the ſubordinate compartment of botany) he exhibited a more decided and elective attachment. In theſe delightful and important branches of ſcience, his accumulation of knowledge was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy extenſive and reſpectable. Had he lived to the cuſtomary period of human life, there is little doubt, but that he would have acquired a place and a name among the moſt diſtinguiſhed chemiſts and naturaliſts of the age.</p>
            <p>Nor did either his taſte for polite literature, or his propenſity to frequent the haunts of the muſes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him while immerſed in the cares and duties of the hoſpital. It was here his ſtyle in proſe received its maturity and its poliſh, and here was the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place of ſome of his fineſt poetic effuſions. In confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this laſt aſſertion, I beg leave to lay before
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035262_0027_1001B401A961FE80"/>
you Dr. Cooper's bold and pictureſque deſcription of the ſeveral varieties of madneſs, contained originally in a letter to myſelf, in the autumn of ninety-three, when we were both medical ſtudents, and the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ideas of which were derived from obſervation on the maniacs, at that time confined within the walls of the hoſpital.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Here moody madneſs, of wild paſſions born,</l>
               <l>Muſes reclined, in ghaſtly ſtate forlorn;</l>
               <l>Or weeps, or laughs, or deſultory ſings,</l>
               <l>Totters along, and ſpeaks unmeaning things;</l>
               <l>Or with fierce eye, lank jaw, and horrent brow,</l>
               <l>Loud raving, clanks his iron chains below!</l>
            </q>
            <p>The accuracy of many of your judgments, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the merit, and the ſenſibility and correctneſs of your taſtes, for the beauties of poetry, ſuperſede the neceſſity of any comment on the foregoing lines. From this time, let Dr. Cooper, as far as relates to the poetic deſcription of madneſs, be ranked with Lee, Penroſe, and the immortal Shakeſpear!</p>
            <p>It is a maxim, equally ancient and well eſtabliſhed, that the acquaintances we form, but, more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the intimacies we contract, reflect, like mirrors, our characters to the world. It may not, therefore, be amiſs to obſerve, that our deceaſed friend was ſo fortunate, in life, as to be favoured with the cloſeſt intimacy and friendſhip by ſeveral diſtinguiſhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, whoſe talents, virtues, and accompliſhments cover his memory with much reflected honour. From the reſpectable catalogue of theſe, I beg leave to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, in particular, the names of Dr. Ruſh, Dr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035262_0028_1001B406487F7DC8"/>
and Mr. Samuel Coates. The two former of theſe were connected with our colleague, principally, by the medium of literature and ſcience: they had been his teachers in medicine, and ſome of its colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral branches, and found him poſſeſſed of virtues and qualities, which conciliated their affection, and commanded their eſteem. But the latter was his friend and patron on all occaſions: ſagacious in the diſcovery, firm in the protection, and zealous in the advancement of youthful merit, he ſaw Dr. Cooper, and became deeply intereſted in the iſſue of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune!</p>
            <p>I feel that I have already engroſſed too much of your time, and treſpaſſed, I am afraid, unwelcomely on your patience. But I flatter myſelf the apology, already offered, will cover the fault I have involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily committed—a fault, indebted, for its origin, to an exceſſive attachment to the memory of my friend! On taking a general ſurvey of the character of our departed fellow-member, quality has crouded on my view after quality, and virtue after virtue, and each one too fair and tempting to be paſſed unnoticed. Nor have I yet completed the illuſtrious catalogue. Though ſome ſmall tribute has been paid, yet ſtill am I deeply in arrears to his merit. I have briefly ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the phyſical talents he poſſeſſed, and have ſlightly glanced at ſome of the amiable qualities of his heart. But reſpecting his moral virtues, I have, hitherto, been ſilent. To ſuffer theſe to remain ſtill in the back ground, unnoticed, and unappraiſed, would render my biographic ſketch extremely imperfect and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035262_0029_1001AE7A53093EC8"/>
exceptionable, and would, indeed, be little leſs than treaſon to the memory of our friend!</p>
            <p>Of the moral virtues of Dr. Cooper I can ſay, in general, that their connected luſtre conſtituted the urſa major, the brighteſt conſtellation in the hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere of his character. He poſſeſſed none of thoſe wild irregularities, none of thoſe immoral habits, none of thoſe vicious propenſities, which are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the lamentable concomitants of genius. Time would fail me were I to attempt a detailed and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual deſcription of this fair and ineſtimable aſſemblage of virtues. I can only add, that they were ſuch, as ſeemed calculated to form a perfect equilibrium and correſpondence between the moral and phyſical parts of his character. We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s powers of intellect origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſtrong? his moral virtues were, in like manner, unſullied—Were the former improved by high culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? the latter were confirmed by experience and habit.</p>
            <p>But in that galaxy, formed by the combined radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the moral qualities of Dr. Cooper, there were two which ſhone with diſtinguiſhed luſtre. I mean his love of juſtice, and his attachment to the indefeaſible rights of man. Such was the power of theſe two virtues, that it led him to a voluntary ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of more than half his fortune, by executing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numiſſions to all his ſlaves. Nor was this action per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with that pauſing heſitation, that calculating reluctance, characteriſtic of a baſe and mercenary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: It was ſpontaneous and prompt, as if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a mind urged on by a pure and irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035262_0030_1001B41597237E10"/>
ſenſe of right. Leſt accident, or death, might intercept the accompliſhment of his upright and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent purpoſes, Dr. Cooper executed manumiſſions to his negroes, on the morning of the day in which he had emerged from the character of a minor. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that the ſun ſhould never behold him volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily aiding in the unprincipled buſineſs of African ſlavery, before that luminary had gilded the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains with his earlieſt beams, the pen was in his hand, to ſubſcribe to the deed, that now gilds his memory with ſuch a blaze of honour. But his humanity, on this occaſion, was in no degree inferior to his love of juſtice, which reſtored to freedom this injured people. For thoſe of his ſlaves who were incapable of ſelf-government and ſupport, he made ſuch proviſions, as were ſufficient to preſerve them from poverty and want.</p>
            <p>As far as relates to the enjoyment of freedom, he acknowledged no diſtinction between the ſable Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, in his humble hut, and the lordly monarch on his ermined throne. So liberal and extenſive were his ſentiments and ſchemes of benevolence, that, like the all-pervading light of heaven, they embraced the whole circle of animated nature.<note n="*" place="bottom">The extent of the charity, benevolence, and alſo of the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Dr. Cooper, is evidenced by the tenor of his laſt will and teſtament, ſubjoined as an appendix to this publication. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is, without any comment, reſpectfully ſubmitted to the attention of the reader. I would beg leave, however, to obſerve, that it ſpeaks the praiſes of the teſtator, in a higher ſtrain of eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gium, than even the pen of a Burke or a Grattan could beſtow?</note> In this reſpect, he even ſurpaſſed the compliment paid to the late earl
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035262_0031_1001B41C1F13F2A8"/>
of Chatham, by his eloquent friend and eulogiſt, the celebrated Grattan. In ſketching the outlines of the character of this unrivalled ſtateſman and orator, the Iriſh Demoſthenes has the following bold and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive expreſſion. "His object was England, his ambition was fame." With truth may I ſay of our departed friend, that his object was more than Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, it was the peopled world; and that his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was more than fame, it was the happineſs of the whole human race!</p>
            <p>But I have not yet completed my analyſis of his mind, nor ſummed up, in full, my account of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Over the preceding aſſemblage of talents and of virtues, was thrown a ſhade of retiring modeſty, which, by ſoftening and even, in appearance, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to conceal their luſtre, rendered them dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly impreſſive and intereſting. Thus, the gauzy veil, floating before the countenances of the fair, height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens their beauty, and adds ſuperior power to their charms. And, thus, the ſhadowy curtains of the night, ſpread along the vault of heaven, awaken into life the luſtre and beauty of its ſlumbering fires!</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the theological principles of Dr. Cooper, I ſhall ſay nothing, except that he was an enthuſiaſtic admirer of the pure and ſublime morality of the chriſtian religion, and regulated, by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, the tenor of his conduct. So ſuperlative was his attachment to a life of peace, that he was never known to interfere in a controverſy, either of a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or of a political nature. He was a quaker, by prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and adoption, though not by birth or early edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035262_0032_1001B425576384B0"/>
He was led to attach himſelf to this denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of chriſtians, in conſequence of diſcovering, that their ſentiments and collective diſpoſition were, in moſt reſpects, in uniſon with his own. He admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the modeſt ſimplicity of their manners, the moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and uprightneſs of their general conduct, and their love of an orderly and peaceful life, and, therefore, reſolved to become one of their ſociety.</p>
            <p>In May, ninety ſeven, our colleague completed his ſtudies, and was admitted to the degree of doctor of medicine, in the univerſity of Pennſylvania. On this occaſion, he acquitted himſelf, in all reſpects, with diſtinguiſhed reputation. But his celebrity, as a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duate, aroſe, more particularly, from the merit of his inaugural diſſertation. This performance treated of the hiſtory and medicinal virtues of the <hi>Datura Stram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium,</hi> an indigenous and very powerful vegetable of our country. It is not exceſſive eulogy to ſay, that, as a piece of experimental inveſtigation, it is not, perhaps, inferior to any diſſertation, of the kind, that has ever appeared, either in this, or in any other country. Was America favoured with many ſuch pupils, to adorn, by graduation, her riſing ſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, we would ſoon become acquainted with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal virtues and powers of all her indigenous ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, many of which now bloom and wither in her fields and foreſts, neglected through inattention, and, through ignorance, unknown!</p>
            <p>In the autumn of ninety-ſeven, Dr. Cooper left the Pennſylvania hoſpital (his term of apprenticeſhip hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now expired) and ſettled, as a practitioner of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035262_0033_1001B42868A61CD8"/>
in the city of Philadelphia. He had, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to this, received ſeveral preſſing, and very flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, invitations to ſettle in different and reſpectable parts of the country; but he rejected them all, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that he had rather live on bread and water, in Philadelphia, in the midſt of literary ſocieties<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Cooper was, already, an active, faithful, and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed member of various literary inſtitutions in Philadelphia. Among theſe may be mentioned, in particular, <hi>the medical ſociety, the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical ſociety,</hi> and <hi>the academy of medicine.</hi>
               </note> and friends, than roll in affluence in the country, remote from ſuch opportunities for the cultivation of his mind.</p>
            <p>Though ſurrounded by phyſicians of talents, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, long eſtabliſhments, and powerful family con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, yet ſtill was he riſing, with rapidity, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional reputation. Already was he employed by many wealthy and reſpectable families: already was he, occaſionally, called into conſultation with the old and eſtabliſhed practitioners of the city, who had, even, been his fathers and teachers in medicine. But his principal buſineſs, and, with truth, may I add, his principal pleaſure, as a phyſician, aroſe from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and gratuitous attentions to the poor. His ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of practical benevolence and charity he did not leave behind him, within the walls of the hoſpital. He bore them with him to the heart of the city, even farther brightened and confirmed by a change of ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Thus the fruit tree, ingrafted on a foreign ſtock, or tranſplanted into a different ſoil, regales the ſenſes by a greater luxuriance of flowers and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035262_0034_1001B42E8F855BB0"/>
fruit! A knowledge of this, often drew to his door objects of poverty, wretchedneſs, and diſeaſe. Nor did he ever give them cauſe to go murmuring or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate away. By his ſkill, as a phyſician, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered relief to their maladies, and, by the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his converſation, the mildneſs of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the indeſcribable tenderneſs of his attention, as a man, he often ſucceeded in diſſipating the gloom that overſhadowed their minds.</p>
            <p>Thus paſſed, till the month of Auguſt, ninety-eight, the hours of our beloved colleague, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in a round of diſſipation, not immerſed in apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic indolence, nor yet devoted to the indulgence of philoſophic eaſe—but divided between the real du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his profeſſion, the active purſuits of ſcience, and the various offices of charity, ariſing out of his ſituation. At this period an event occurred, which the genius of Philadelphia has already enrolled in the darkeſt page of her catalogue of misfortunes, and the effects of which, ſhe will long—very long, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, with juſtice, to deplore. Nor did, even, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of Columbia remain inſenſible to the ſorrows of his daughter. The general concerns of the nation, for a while, neglected, he appeared to mingle his tears with hers, over ſuch an unprecedented inſtance of calamity. But the diſtreſſes of our city were not confined to the boſoms of its own immediate inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: Like the ripple, ſpreading around over the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the lake, they were communicated along the inexplicable web of human feeling, till, by breaſts of ſympathy, they were finally realized, even in the moſt diſtant extremes of our country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:035262_0035_1001B43634B024D8"/>To you it is unneceſſary for me to mention the cauſe of this unparalleled extent and complexity of diſtreſs. It is already imprinted on your memories, in charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which, in point of permanency, beggar any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions that can poſſibly reſult from my feeble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents. It is unneceſſary for me to inform you, that, at this period, we were a third time viſited by that firſt of phyſical evils, which, by way of pre-eminence in horror and fatality, our divines have emphatically denominated "the deſtroying angel," I mean the vengeful ſpirit of peſtilence! This inſatiate demon (like the poet's Python, deſcended from the ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filth, depoſited by the waters of Deucalion's flood)—this demon, I ſay, ſprung from the co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſources of filth, in our city, our ſuburbs, and along our wharves, invaded our habitations in all his horrors. Nor did he come alone: Terror was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned the leader of his van, while agony, death, and deſolation were marſhalled in the rear. Thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, and thus arrayed, the malignant ſpirit ſwept, with his inexorable myrmidons, along our ſtreets, diffuſing around his envenomed breath. At once were our proſpects of pleaſure and ſecurity blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; at once was the aſpect of our city metamorphoſed. No longer the crouded emporium of our country—no longer the haunt of gaiety and eaſe, Philadelphia was converted into a ſcene of conſternation and tumult. From every tongue dropped expreſſions of terror— on every face ſat the gloom of dejection, mingled with the wildneſs of deep apprehenſion. Flying from the city, as if its foundations were convulſed by the rockings of an earthquake, or its buildings threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035262_0036_1001B43ACFFE2978"/>
to be whelmed in a deluge of lava, the eyes and footſteps of all were directed in queſt of an aſſylum, in the depth of the country! Still, however, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac rage!—ſtill with more than giant-ſtrides, went forward the dreadful work of deſtruction!—But I forbear from a farther deſcription of the tragical ſcene—The attempt, at beſt, muſt prove abortive, and would, no doubt, in the minds of ſome, by whoſe preſence I am honoured, tend to a renovation of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which I had much rather be inſtrumental in ſoothing into a ſtate of tranquillity, or even of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and everlaſting ſleep!</p>
            <p>Amid this embattled chaos of diſorder and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, our departed colleague was by no means, an idle, or an indifferent ſpectator. He early diſcovered, and moſt devoutly deprecated, the impending cloud of calamity, nor ſaw, without ſolicitude, the burſting of the tempeſt. But his fears and anxieties reſpected not his own perſonal health and ſafety. They ſprang from a much more generous ſource, the health and ſafety of his friends and fellow-citizens. Calm, intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, and reſigned, as far as reſpected himſelf, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, from the firſt, to ride out the ſtorm, or be wrecked, a faithful and ſpontaneous matryr to the duties of his profeſſion. So powerful was this ſenſe of duty, and ſo unconquerable this ſentiment of hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, that neither the entreaties of his friends, nor the moſt bold and pictureſque repreſentation of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that awaited him, could have the ſmalleſt effect in diverting him from his purpoſe. With a mind that delighted in contending with difficulties—a mind, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing an elective attraction to objects of greatneſs,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035262_0037_1001B440FA38A1F0"/>
he determined, if poſſible, to take his ſtand, amid the moſt formidable concentration of diſeaſe!</p>
            <p>While influenced by this temper and diſpoſition of mind, Dr. Cooper was called, in conjunction with his illuſtrious friend and colleague, Dr. Phyſic, to take the medical charge of the city hoſpital. The end and object of this inſtitution it is unneceſſary for me to mention. It is known to you all, to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as a receptacle for peſtilential ſubjects, from all parts of the city and liberties. Amid the ravages of ſuch a deſolating calamity, the walls of the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital were ſoon found to be too contracted, to anſwer the benevolent purpoſes of its eſtabliſhment. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly rapid and profuſe was the influx of the ſick, that it became neceſſary to pitch tents, and erect temporary buildings for their accomodation.</p>
            <p>Here was a ſcene, where, even, the mind of Dr. Cooper might find ample room for the exerciſe of all its powers, and the exhibition of all its virtues. Here it might exhauſt the ſources of its ſtrength and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, here find ſcope for its unwearied activity, here expend the laſt drop of its benevolence and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!—For the ability and addreſs of the phyſician, here exiſted a malignant and formidable epitome of all febrile diſeaſes; for the engagement of the man of active induſtry, here were duties, numerous, diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and preſſing, in the extreme; and to excite the ſympathetic attention of the man of humanity and benevolence, here was a conſummation of wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſery!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:035262_0038_1001B44BB85981B0"/>In each branch of this threefold character, Dr. Cooper was qualified to acquit himſelf with equal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence. But, on the preſent important and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly occaſion, the extent of his abilities was the only meaſure of the ſervices he rendered. It is not ſufficient to ſay, that his life, while engaged in the city hoſpital, was a circle of action, it was an uninterrupted ſeries of laborious exertion. Ever awake to the whiſperings of duty—ever painfully ſenſible to the ſufferings of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, he acted as the phyſician, the nurſe, and the friend, to thoſe whom diſeaſe had ſubjected to his care. But his attention to himſelf bore an inverſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio to his attention to others. Abſorbed in his views of public good, his own individual ſafety was baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his mind. In his exceſſive zeal for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the inſtitution which he ſerved, he even neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or reſiſted the calls of his ſyſtem for refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and repoſe. Often has he relinquiſhed his table for the more delicious banquet of contributing to the relief and ſafety of the agonized objects by which he was ſurrounded—Often has the noon of night looked down, with approbation, on his round, through the crowded wards, and the following day-dawn deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried him remote from his pillow!</p>
            <p>In the intervals of his exertion as a phyſician, nurſe, and friend, to the ſick, he devoted his time to diſſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and various phyſical experiments, calculated to throw light on the ſeat, the cauſe, the nature, and the treatment of peſtilential diſeaſes. By this was his ſituation rendered doubly perilous. But, in a mind like his, a ſenſe of duty, co-operating with a zeal for the promotion of ſcience, is paramount to every ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh

conſideration. Enterprizing and intrepid as the celebrated but unfortunate Roſier, he appears, like him, to have fallen a victim to a daring experiment.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Phyſic, with much apparent reaſon, attributes the origin of Dr. Cooper's diſeaſe, to his having viſited the city, in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of Auguſt, during the height of our peſtilential conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of atmoſphere, with a view to ſubject the air of our ſtreets, particularly, of that part of Water-ſtreet, from which, the diſeaſe appeared to ſpread, as from a focus, to a ſeries of eudiometrical experiments.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Beneath the preſſure of ſuch powerful and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted bodily and intellectual exertion, tired nature could not poſſibly do otherwiſe than languiſh. For, to exceſſive action, of whatever kind, debility never fails to ſucceed, in conformity to an eſtabliſhed principle in the nature of man. Under ſuch a combination of circumſtances, the ſeeds of peſtilence, which Dr. Cooper appears to have inhaled from the atmoſphere of Philadelphia, and which had lain, for ſome time, dormant in his ſyſtem, could not avoid being awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened into life and action. Accordingly, this melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occurrence took place on the 26th of Auguſt, the ſame month in which he received his appointment to the hoſpital.</p>
            <p>Nor was his diſeaſe uſhered in with ſymtoms of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary magnitude. Such was their unuſual power and malignity, that each one ſeemed ſeparately commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as the meſſenger of deſtruction. The demon of peſtilence, as if exaſperated at having been ſo often diſarmed in a combat with the ſkill and addreſs of this young phyſician, appears, on this occaſion, to have concentrated all his ſtrength and ferocity, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035262_0040_1001AEB3193D49D8"/>
at once, on deciſive revenge. Over the iſſue of his dark and fatal purpoſe, let the friends of ſcience and humanity weep!</p>
            <p>So fierce and violent was the commencement of Dr. Cooper's diſeaſe, that it wrecked, like a tempeſt, every fibre of his ſyſtem. At its very onſet, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of life were proſtrated almoſt to extinction. For ſeveral hours they remained, to a great degree, torpid and inactive, as if in ſuſpenſe whether or not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for ever from the field of a conflict, ſo unequal in point of ſtrength, and ſo certain in its termination. At length, however, they began to revive from the violence of the ſhock, to which they had been ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—At length they attempted to return to the charge, and offer reſiſtance to the invading enemy!—But the reſiſtance was feeble, irregular, and ineffectual—It reſembled the convulſive and vacillating reſiſtance of a ſoldier, ſinking beneath a wound from a victorious adverſary.—But the unexpected treſpaſs I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy committed on your patience, forbids me to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute on this part of my ſubject.</p>
            <p>I call not your attention to the medical exertions that were made for the preſervation of the life of our departed colleague. Under this head, it is ſufficient to ſay, that he was entruſted to the care of a Phyſic, and a Ruſh—men, whoſe minds are an abſtract of the ſcience of medicine, while their hearts are conſecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the dwelling of humanity and benevolence!</p>

            <p>Nor will I attempt to awaken your ſympathy, nor excite your admiration, by minutely pourtraying to you his conduct, during the courſe of his illneſs. Though he realized his ſufferings and approaching diſſolution, not with the indifference of an inſulated miſanthrope—not with the immoveable apathy of a ſtoic—but with the genuine feelings and ſolicitude of a man; yet he bore the one, with the fortitude of a philoſopher, and ſubmitted to the other, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of a chriſtian. On the third of September, ninety-eight, the fatal and looked-for cataſtrophe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred. On this day, he yielded to his diſeaſe, having nearly completed the twenty-ſeventh year of his age.</p>
            <p>The place of his interment is not far diſtant—In yonder<note n="*" place="bottom">The Friends' burying-ground, at the ſouth-eaſt corner of Fourth and Arch ſtreets.</note> neighbouring and capacious reſervoir of the exuviae of the dead, lie depoſited his mouldering re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics. His body was conducted thither by four of his particular friends,<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Samuel Coates, Dr. Thomas Horſefield, Mr. George Lee, and Mr. Francis Higgins. It is but juſtice to obſerve, that theſe ſame gentlemen viſited him, frequently, at the city-hoſpital, during his laſt illneſs.</note> whom, not even the dangers and horrors of peſtilence could deter from attending his funeral, and bathing, with their tears, his hallowed grave! May the dews of heaven weep tenderly over him!—May they decorate his turf with their bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

pearls!—And may the ſympathiſing breezes, as they paſs along, ſigh out their ſorrows for his untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall!</p>
            <p>To the melancholy circumſtances attending the cloſe of the life of Dr. Cooper, I beg leave to apply a quotation from an epiſtolary poem, I had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to receive from him, in the autumn of ninety-three, in which, with a boldneſs and pathos peculiar to himſelf, he deſcribes and laments the death of an intimate friend, who fell a ſacrifice to the peſtilence of that period.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <head>LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF <hi>DR. SAMUEL COOPER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>I, SAMUEL COOPER, late of Maryland, but now of Philadelphia, phyſician, do make my laſt will and teſtament, in manner and form following, viz.</p>
            <p>I will, that my debts be diſcharged, and my fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expenſes paid by my executors.</p>
            <p>Having always abhorred ſlavery, in every ſhape, I have freed all my negroes, by executing, as I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, proper manumiſſions; but if any thing is infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally done, or any thing is wanting to complete their emancipation, I requeſt my executors to do it, and to liberate the girls at eighteen, and the boys at twenty-one years of age, if any of them ſurvive me, and to charge the expenſe to my eſtate; and I allow my executors, if they ſee occaſion, to pay any charge that may be found neceſſary by them, to procure ſuitable places for the young children, and to ſecure to them the opportunity of obtaining a little ſchool learning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:035262_0046_1001B4782CDC15C8"/>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—I will, that my executors collect my out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding debts, in particular, a legacy of one hundred and fifty pounds, with its intereſt, which was left me by my grandfather, Thomas Wincheſter, deceaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—I will, that my executors, hereafter named, ſhall ſell, at any time they may think beſt, at public or private ſale, for caſh or on credit, at their own diſcretion, my two plantations or tracts of land, in Talbot county, in the ſtate of Maryland, with all their improvements, and make good and ſufficient titles for the ſaid lands and improvements, to the purchaſer or purchaſers, in fee ſimple; and all the monies ariſing therefrom (after payment of my debts, and providing, if need be, for my young negroes, as above mentioned) I give, with all the ſecurities they may take for the ſaid lands, to <hi>the Contributors to the Pennſylvania Hoſpital.</hi> But as it may happen, that I may ſell thoſe lands myſelf, which I have ſome thoughts of doing, it is my will, in that caſe, that the ſaid contributors ſhall have and poſſeſs all the monies and ſecurities I take for both or either of thoſe places, in the ſame manner as if my executors were to ſell them, under the preceding directions.</p>
            <p>Having ſerved my apprenticeſhip in the Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia hoſpital, I know it to be a moſt valuable and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inſtitution, not only as the beſt aſylum in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, for lunatics and the ſick poor, but alſo the beſt ſchool of inſtruction for a medical pupil. With theſe ſentiments, I eſteem it a duty I owe to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to devote my earthly ſubſtance to encourage and promote it, in preference to any temporal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035262_0047_1001AEDC7B81EEB8"/>
I do, therefore, give to the contributors to the ſaid hoſpital and to their ſucceſſors for ever, as well my ſaid two plantations, as all the monies that may ariſe from the ſale thereof, by me, or by my execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and all my other eſtate, both real and perſonal, whatſoever, to and for the following uſes, viz.</p>
            <p>I requeſt them to buy a neat, ſubſtantial coachee, or light waggon, that will conveniently hold a dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and ſix perſons, with its furniture complete, to procure which I allow them to pay a ſum not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſix hundred dollars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—I requeſt them to buy two good, ſound, and able-bodied horſes, neither of which to be more than eight years old, in the opinion of good judges; to purchaſe which, I allow them to expend a ſum not exceeding five hundred dollars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—I allow them to retain, of my eſtate, any ſum they may think ſufficient to pay a coachman two years' wages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—I recommend that the carriage or horſes may never be lent from the houſe, nor ſuffered to be out all night, unleſs the carriage is ſent to be mended, or the horſes to paſture; that it be uſed, only, for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients and their needful attendants, or to bring to, or take from, the hoſpital, the managers, treaſurer, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
