            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A BRIEF ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>AT the earne≈øt reque≈øt of many enquiring minds, I have undertaken to pre≈øent to the publick, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, form and manner of a new and ≈øtrange religion, that has lately taken place among many people in the States of Ma≈ø≈øachu≈øetts and of New-York; and in pur≈øuing my purpo≈øe, I ≈øhall take the following method.</p>
                  <p>In the fir≈øt place, I will pre≈øent to view, the leaders and teachers of this new and ≈øtrange religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I will ≈øhew their manner of addre≈øs.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. I will ≈øhew their doctrine, with the ≈øcripture evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they bring to prove it.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. I will ≈øhew their manner of wor≈øhip.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. I ≈øhall ≈øhew the directions which they give to tho≈øe that come to them, to be in≈øtructed.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. I will ≈øhew the power and effect of their in≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on their adherents.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. I ≈øhall ≈øhew what this new religion is, us pointed out by ≈øcripture te≈øtimony.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. I ≈øhall give ≈øome rea≈øons for my knowledge in this new religion, not by mere ≈øpeculation, but by ≈øorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful experience.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. I ≈øhall clo≈øe the whole by a word of advice to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters and people.</p>
                  <p>To return therefore according to my promi≈øe, in the fir≈øt place to pre≈øent to publick view, the leaders and teachers of this new and ≈øtrange religion.</p>
                  <p>The whole number con≈øi≈øts of five males and ≈øeven fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males; three of the males, and two females, profe≈øs to be perfect, or to have attained a ≈øtate of perfection; the other
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017681_0003_0FA21E2ECFFD5688"/>≈øeven not perfect yet, but very far advanced. This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are Europeans, a part of which came from England to New-York in the year 1774, and lived at New-York and Albany, and places adjacent, two years‚Äîand in the year 1776, the re≈øt came to Philadelphia, and travelled through Penn≈øylvania to New-York, where the whole twelve came together, and directly went and made a purcha≈øe of land, in a place called Ni≈øqueunia, about nine or ten miles north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we≈øt from Albany, where they immediately ≈øettled, and went to clearing their land, and following their occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of black≈ømithing, weaving and ≈øhoe-making and were unknown and unnoticed, unle≈øs by a few of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, until the 17th day of April 1780; at which time one Talmage Bi≈øhop brought tidings into New-Lebanon of a number of ≈øtrange and wonderful Chri≈øtians; the people, like the Athenians of old, were filled with define to ≈øee new things, and ran to ≈øee them. This brings me to ≈øhew,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Their manner of addre≈øs.</p>
                  <p>When any per≈øon goes to ≈øee them, they all meet him with many ≈ømiles, and ≈øeeming great gladne≈øs; they bid him welcome, and directly tell him they knew of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye≈øterday. This ≈øets the per≈øon to wondering at their knowledge, and pre≈øently they get the per≈øon ≈øome victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; then they ≈øit down and have a ≈øpell of ≈øinging; they ≈øing odd tunes, and Briti≈øh marches, ≈øometimes without words, and ≈øometimes with a minute of words known and unknown. After ≈øinging they fall to ≈øhaking their hands in a very extraordinary manner, with their eyes ≈øhut and face up; then a woman about forty years old ≈øits and makes a ≈øort of a prayer, chiefly in an unknown tongue (if I may ≈øo call it) then one of the men comes to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and pretends to interpret the woman's prayer; after which they tell the per≈øon the has come to the right place to be in≈øtructed; they enquire the per≈øon's name, and ever after call him by his Chri≈øtian name: They u≈øe no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, but their language is, <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>nay.</hi> If the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon have long hair, or a club, they bring the bible, and read to him 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. chap. and 14th ver≈øe, then telling him if he intends to be in≈øtructed, he mu≈øt fir≈øt have his hair out ≈øhort; telling of his that he wears the mark of the bea≈øt.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017681_0004_0FA21E2FD8AEA250"/>If he con≈øents to have his hair cut, after it is done, they come round him, and touch him with their fingers here and there, and give him a fly cro≈øs, and in a very loving way, put their hands on his head, and then begin to preach their doctrine to him. But this leads me to enter on the third thing propo≈øed, viz.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To ≈øhew their doctrine, with the ≈øcripture evidence they bring to prove it.</p>
                  <p>They introduce their doctrine with a multitude of good words; ≈øaying, we mu≈øt hate ≈øin, love GOD, take up our cro≈øs, &amp;c. Then proceed to ≈øay, in the fir≈øt place, that there is a new di≈øpen≈øation taking place, in which the ≈øaints ≈øhall reign a thou≈øand years with Chri≈øt, and that in that ≈øtate the ≈øaints ≈øhall be perfect, and that they have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into it, and that they are the only church in the world; telling the per≈øon or hearer, that they have all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtolic gifts that were ever given; they tell the per≈øon that he has come to the right place for in≈øtruction, for they only are able to teach; then they pau≈øe a while to ≈øee how the per≈øon receives it, if they find he li≈øtens, and ≈øeems to be coming, they proceed and ≈øay, all the churches now in the world are antichri≈øt, and fal≈øe churches, and that there is not one per≈øon born again among them all, and that there has not one gone to Heaven for the≈øe twelve hundred years, no, not ≈øince the Apo≈øtolick age. If the per≈øon makes any objections, they tell him he mu≈øt not di≈øpute, his bu≈øine≈øs is to hear and receive in≈øtruction, and all hands will fall to confirming the truth of what is declared: This puts the per≈øon to ≈øilence, and then they proceed, with a great laugh, and tell him they have many things to ≈øay to him, which he is not yet able to bear; this is to engage to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to hear. Then, ≈øecondly, they proceed to ≈øay, that all external ordinances, e≈øpecially bapti≈øm and the Lord's ≈øupper, cea≈øed in the Apo≈øtolick age; and that God had never ≈øent one man to preach, ≈øince the Apo≈øtles days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they entered into the new di≈øpen≈øation, and were ≈øent by God, from Great-Britain, to call in God's elect; and to confirm the truth of what the teacher has ≈øaid, he (the teacher) falls a trembling, and will ≈øay he feels the blood of Chri≈øt now running down his thigh and leg. Then they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017681_0005_0FA21E307482CF60"/>tell the per≈øon the cannot bear any more now, but he mu≈øt come again very ≈øoon and they will tell him more; and thus they with many fawning embraces, part with him for that time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When he comes again they meet him with great joy, cla≈øp him in their arms, and tell him they have the great love of God; and after things are a little ≈øettled, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with him again, telling him that he mu≈øt confe≈øs his ≈øins to them, from his childhood, that they may take his ca≈øe and travail for him, that he may be born again. If he be a profe≈ø≈øor of godline≈øs, and pleads that he hopes his ≈øins are forgiven, and wa≈øhed away by the blood of Chri≈øt; they tell him nay, they are not forgiven. They tell him what≈øoever is done in ≈øecret mu≈øt be revealed on the hou≈øe-top; and that they being the church, are the hou≈øe-top. Then one takes him alone, and if he confe≈ø≈øes his ≈øins to him, then he tells it to the re≈øt: But if it be ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected he keeps back part of his ≈øin, he mu≈øt confe≈øs the whole all being pre≈øent.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They tell him they ≈øee angels, and conver≈øe with them, and hear them ≈øing, and ≈øing with them; and the ≈øpirits of ju≈øt men made perfect, they al≈øo freely conver≈øe with. They further tell him, the ≈øong that they ≈øing, is the ≈øong of the hundred and forty and four thou≈øand, which no man can learn, but only tho≈øe that are redeemed from the earth. Then tell him, they have got a mother point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a woman, one of their company: And that ≈øhe ≈øpeaks ≈øeventy-two tongues, and that when ≈øhe ≈øpeaks in unknown tongues, the living people cannot under≈øtand her; yet the dead under≈øtand her, for ≈øhe talks to them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They proceed and ≈øay, the judgment is ≈øet, the books are opened, and the dead are now ri≈øing, and coming to judgment, and they are ≈øet to judge the world: Quoting 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. chap. 2 ver≈øe. They tell the per≈øon, that the great tribunal is that church, and that the dead are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them every day, to be judged. They go on to ≈øay, all that have died in an imperfect ≈øtate, have gone to hell, or to a pri≈øon ≈øtate; and there to pay the debt to divine ju≈øtice by ≈øuffering; and that there are degrees of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017681_0006_0FA21E31358D9458"/>puni≈øhment, which they are to pa≈øs through; great ≈øins, a great degree of hell, ≈ømall ≈øins, a ≈ømall hell: And after pa≈ø≈øing through the ≈øeveral degrees of puni≈øhment, and paying the whole debt, out they come, and ≈øtand before us (≈øay they) and are acquitted, and go home to Heaven; they quote for proof, <hi>P≈øal.</hi> xvi. 10. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> lxviii. 18. <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> xvi. 44‚Äî61. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> iii. 18, 19, 20. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> iv. 6.</p>
                  <p>They comment on tho≈øe texts thus: Did Chri≈øt go to hell? Yes. When? Why when he was crucified. What did he go there for? Why to preach to the ≈øpirits in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon. What did he preach to them? Why the go≈øpel. Why did he preach the go≈øpel to the old world, or to the dead? Why that they might be judged, as unconverted ≈øinners, but finally live, according to God, in the ≈øpirit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have paid the debt in ≈øuffering.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They ≈øay, that the forecited woman, about forty years of age, is the woman ≈øpoken of in the xiith chapter of the Revelations of John, who was cloathed with the ≈øun, having the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve ≈øtars; and that ≈øhe has travailed and brought forth the man child. Further, that ≈øhe is the mother of all the elect; and that ≈øhe travail, for the whole world; and that no ble≈ø≈øing can come to any per≈øon, but only by and through her; and that in the way of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of their ≈øins, by their confe≈ø≈øing of them, and repenting of the ≈øame, one by one, according to her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

                  <p n="4">IV. To ≈øhew their manner of wor≈øhip (if it may be ≈øo called.)</p>
                  <p>The manner and form of their wor≈øhip is entirely new
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017681_0007_0FA21E3206B719D8"/>and different from all others: It differs but little on the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, from any other day: They begin by ≈øitting down and ≈øhaking their heads in a violent manner, turning their heads half round, ≈øo that their face looks over each ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, their eyes being ≈øhut; while they are thus ≈øhaking, one will begin to ≈øing ≈øome odd tune, without words or rule; after a while another will ≈øtrike in; and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and after a while they all fail in, and make a ≈øtrange charm:‚ÄîSome ≈øinging without words, and ≈øome with an unknown tongue, or mutter, and ≈øome with a mixture of Engli≈øh: The mother, ≈øo called minds to ≈øtrike ≈øuch notes as makes a concord, and ≈øo form the charm. When they leave off ≈øinging, they drop off, one by one, as oddly as they come on; in the be≈øt part of their wor≈øhip, every one acts for him≈øelf, and almo≈øt every one different from the other; one will ≈øtand with his arms extended, acting over odd po≈øtures, which they call ≈øigns; another will be danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ≈øometimes hopping on one leg about the floor; another will fall to turning round, ≈øo ≈øwift, that if it be a woman, her cloaths will be ≈øo filled with the wind as though they were kept out by a hoop; another will be pro≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate on the floor; another will be talking with ≈øomebody; and ≈øome ≈øitting by ≈ømoaking their pipes; ≈øome groaning mo≈øt di≈ømally; ≈øome trembling extremely; others acting as though all their nerves were convul≈øed; others ≈øwinging their arms, with all vigour, as though they were turning a wheel, &amp;c. Then all break off and have a ≈øpell of ≈ømoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ≈øometimes great fits of laughter.‚ÄîThey have ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ≈øuch exerci≈øes in a day, e≈øpecially on the Sabbath. When they go to eat, they ≈øit down, and have a ≈øpell of ≈øinging and ≈øhaking the head at the table, before they eat, ≈øome times they kneel down, ≈øhake their heads and groan, ≈øay nothing, and then fall to eating, and will be very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and airy. If one has done eating before the re≈øt, he kneels down, ≈øhakes his head a ≈øpell, and off he goes and leaves the re≈øt eating; ≈øo each one di≈ømi≈ø≈øes the table for him≈øelf: But it is impo≈ø≈øible to point out any exact form; for they vary and differ, and ≈øeldom act the ≈øame form exactly over again. They chu≈øe ≈øo to do, to be ≈øingular,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017681_0008_0FA21E32C4175D00"/>left, as they ≈øay, they ≈øhould be connected with Babylon Every day their wor≈øhip is ≈øimilar to what has been ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They have no publick prayer, no preaching, and but little reading. Their actions in wor≈øhip is according to the dictates of the ≈øpirit that governs them; then they profe≈øs ≈øaying, they are in a ≈øpiritual di≈øpen≈øation.</p>
                  <p>Having thus ≈øhewn as far as may be, their manner of wor≈øhip, I proceed fifthly, to ≈øhew the directions which they give to tho≈øe that come to them to be in≈øtructed.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. When any per≈øon goes to them to be in≈øtructed, they enquire of him, whether he has given his vote and money for the defence of the country, and pre≈øently tell him, it is contrary to the Go≈øpel to bear arms, ≈øaying Chri≈øt's kingdom is not of this world; they labour to convince him that it is a great error to have any thing to do with war and fighting: They directly tell him, he is not born again, and that he mu≈øt ob≈øerve their in≈øtructions, in order that he may attain to the new birth.‚ÄîThen they tell him, he mu≈øt confe≈øs his ≈øin to them; for if he hides his ≈øin they can do nothing for him: They further tell him, if he refu≈øes, they can tell him all his ≈øin that he ever committed; and pretend that he can keep nothing hid from them; and when they have frightened him to a confe≈ø≈øion, then they further tell him, he mu≈øt renounce and ab≈øtain from all the works of the fle≈øh; telling him, that the fir≈øt fall of our fir≈øt parents, was carnal copulation, and that this ruined the world; and that every one that has any thing to do with man or woman, in the work of generation, is acting <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>'s ≈øin over again: They tell the man to ob≈øtain from his wife, the woman from her hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and that if the wife doth not agree to it, the hu≈øband mu≈øt put her away; and if the hu≈øband will not agree to it, the wife mu≈øt leave her hu≈øband; and for an example, the mother, ≈øo called, will tell how ≈øhe left her hu≈øband, in New-York, and one of the men, how he left his wife in England. They tell young men and young women, if they marry, and have any thing to do with the works of lu≈øts of the fle≈øh, they can never be born again: They
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017681_0009_0FA21E338A80B0B0"/>≈øhew the nece≈ø≈øity of receiving this in≈øtruction by quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Rev.</hi> iii 3, 4, 5. They dwell more on this part of their in≈øtructions than all the re≈øt. They tell their adherents, if they conform to their in≈øtructions in this point, there is no fear of their being born again; but if they di≈øobey, they certainly will be damned. While they are thus in≈øtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their adherents, they ≈øometimes u≈øe great ≈øeverity, and ≈øometimes great flattery, to frighten on the one hand and allure on the other; and while they are thus at work with a per≈øon, they come round him, touch him with their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in different places, cro≈øs him here and there, get their hands on his head, and prophecy, that great ble≈ø≈øings are laid up for him: They pre≈øently make him believe them, and as ≈øoon as they ≈øee the ≈øpirit begin to operate on him, then they tell him, that now he has received the Holy Gho≈øt, and now if he di≈øobeys, it is a gone ca≈øe with him: They tell him, if he had never come to ≈øee them, and had died in his ignorance without receiving the Holy Gho≈øt, he would have gone to hell or a pri≈øon ≈øtate, and ≈øuffered a while, and then come out and gone to Heaven; but now, if he turns back, there is no forgivene≈øs, neither in this world, nor that which is to come: They quote for proof, <hi>Matt.</hi> xii. 32. This is to terrify the per≈øon, and bring him into an ab≈øolute dependence on them: Then they tell him, he mu≈øt come often to them to be in≈øtructed, or he will be in danger of being taken by evil ≈øpirits and led wrong; and that he mu≈øt not think he can under≈øtand the Bible, or know in any re≈øpect how to act, but only as he receives in≈øtruction from them: They tell him they have many things for him, which he is not yet able to bear; but as fa≈øt as he is able to receive it, they will in≈øtruct him: Thus the per≈øon is kept in con≈øtant expectation of ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new. If the per≈øon ≈øeems to be ≈øober, then one takes him by the hand, and round the floor with him, and make him run and ≈økip about, and laugh heartily at him, and will tell him he mu≈øt not be melancholy; and when they get him merry with them then let him go: Then they tell the per≈øon for his admiration, that ≈øince he has been
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017681_0010_0FA21E34478AA230"/>pre≈øent, they have had many of the dead come before them to be judged; and make him believe they know his thoughts, and know future events, and nothing can be hid from them; telling how people are together, and talking about them, and what they ≈øay, &amp;c. Then they tell the per≈øon that they ≈øhall never die, and al≈øo all tho≈øe that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them, and get to be perfect, ≈øhall never die, but be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a moment, and go home body and ≈øoul: But all the bodies of tho≈øe that die in their ≈øin, ≈øhall never ri≈øe.‚ÄîThey further tell him, that the hundred and forty and four thou≈øand, which were ≈øealed; twelve thou≈øand out of each tribe, is a work yet to be done; and that they are of the tribe of Benjamin, though the younge≈øt tribe, and la≈øt in the account, yet fir≈øt in the order, of being ≈øealed; and that they are the fir≈øt fruits of that tribe; and that all that are to be brought in, in America, will belong to that tribe: And thus, the la≈øt is to be fir≈øt, and the fir≈øt la≈øt.</p>
                  <p>I might ≈øtill proceed, on this head; but it would be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs to repeat all their in≈øtructions to their adherents, as they are ever ≈øtudying new things to keep up the dependence and admiration of their di≈øciples. I ≈øhall therefore pa≈øs on.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. To ≈øhew the power and effect of their in≈øtructions, on their adherents.</p>
                  <p>There is a very extraordinary and uncommon power attends their in≈øtructions; in the fir≈øt place, a total blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, as to all their former views of religion and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, on the in≈øtructed, takes place; and then a ≈øtrange infatuation of the mind, to believe all their teachers ≈øay. Pre≈øently a ≈øtrange power begins to come on, and takes place in the body, or human frame; which ≈øets the per≈øon to gaping and ≈øtretching; and ≈øoon ≈øets him to twitching, as though his nerves were all in a convul≈øion. I can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it to nothing nearer in its feelings, than the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an electeri≈øing machine; the per≈øon believes it is the power of God, and therefore dare not re≈øi≈øt, but wholly gives way to it.‚ÄîThus the power comes on, more and more; and as the power increa≈øes, ≈øo their faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øes,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017681_0011_0FA21E34F4B63F58"/>in their teachers. If any body oppo≈øes them, it brings on the power, quick, ≈øtrong and violent; and they cry out, on the oppo≈øer, that he will be damn'd, for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing the power of God; and fall to twitching and trembling, as though they had an extreme fit of the ague. This power as it increa≈øes, it brings on, many times, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme weakne≈øs of body, ≈øo that their limbs fail them, and they fall to the floor, or on the ground, and lie helple≈øs: At other times, it brings on great ≈øhakings‚Äîand ≈øhrugging of the ≈øhoulders‚Äîand tramping about with the feet‚Äîdi≈ømal groans and out-cries‚Äîand perhaps, may i≈ø≈øue, for that time, in great laughter and lightne≈øs. And at the time of intervals, they grow very dumb, and ≈øay but little; and as the power has its fits on them, ≈øo it grows more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, until it leads on to what they call ≈øigns. The power will take their hand, ≈øtretch it up, pull the other down, they interpret it‚Äîthe hand up, is a ≈øign of mercy, the hand down, of judgment: Sometimes their hand is ≈øtretched out forward, then away they run after it; if it leads to ≈øome per≈øon, they lay their hand on his head‚Äîthen cro≈øs their arms, one acro≈øs the other‚Äîthen ≈øay he mu≈øt take up his cro≈øs, and renounce the works of the fle≈øh‚Äîthen they ≈øtretch both hands behind them, and ≈øay he mu≈øt leave the world behind him: Sometimes their hands will be cramped up, one finger ≈øtretched out ≈øtrait, another down into their hand, and their hand all out of common ≈øhape: Sometimes their hand will ≈øtretch out, and after it they run,‚Äîthrough woods‚Äîcro≈øs lots‚Äîover fences, ≈øwamps, or whatever, until they come to a hou≈øe; perhaps they will be ≈øtopt ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times in their cour≈øe, and their head turn them round, as though they had lo≈øt their way; then take a new ≈øet off, and run again; perhaps, when they get to the hou≈øe, they will lie down on the ground‚Äîmake a round ring with their finger among the dirt‚Äîputher about in it‚Äîthen ≈øtart up‚Äîdouble their fi≈øt at it‚Äîrun away from it‚Äîcome at it again‚Äî≈øhow the looks of vengeance at it‚Äîthreaten it with po≈øtures‚Äîthen run and jump into it, and ≈øtamp it all to pieces‚ÄîThis ≈øign they interpret to be the old Heavens,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017681_0012_0FA21E3643BC5450"/>which are to pa≈øs away with a great noi≈øe.‚ÄîWhen he goes into the hou≈øe, he flutters round with his hands flying, and hi≈ø≈øing as if he intended to drive all the flies out of the room‚ÄîBut this, he ≈øays, is to haunt the evil ≈øpirits out, which the hou≈øe is full of.</p>
                  <p>After he has done his errand, he follows his hand off, without a≈øking how they do, or bidding them farewell.‚ÄîWhen they meet together for their wor≈øhip, they fall to groaning and trembling, and every one acts alone for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf; one will fall pro≈øtrate on the floor, another on his knees, and his head in his hands, on the floor; another will be muttering over articulate ≈øounds, which neither they or any body el≈øe under≈øtand. Some will be ≈øinging, each one his own tune; ≈øome without words, in an Indian tone, ≈øome ≈øing jig tunes, ≈øome tunes of their own making in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known mutter, which they call new tongues; ≈øome will be dancing, and others ≈øtand laughing heartily and loudly; others will be drumming on the floor with their feet, as though a pair of drum-≈øticks were beating a ruff on a drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; others will be agonizing, as though they were in great pain; others jumping up and down; others fluttering over ≈øome body, and talking to them; others will be ≈øhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hi≈ø≈øing evil ≈øpirits out of the hou≈øe, until the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent tunes, groaning, jumping, dancing, drumming, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, talking and fluttering, ≈øhooing and hi≈ø≈øing, makes a perfect Bedlam; this they call the wor≈øhip of God. They ≈øpeak highly of their teachers, and ≈øay tho≈øe men at Ni≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queunia are the angels of God, ≈øent forth to gather in God's elect. Some of them ≈øay, that the woman called the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, has the fullne≈øs of the God-Head, bodily dwelling in her, and that ≈øhe is the queen of Heaven, Chri≈øt's wife; and that all God's elect mu≈øt be born through her; yea, that Chri≈øt through her is born the ≈øecond time. They ≈øay, that that church (as they call it) has power to ≈øhut Heaven, that it rain not, and to bring on all manner of plagues, as often as they will. They prophecy that this go≈øpel (as they call it) mu≈øt be preached to all the world, and all tho≈øe that do not fall in with it will be damned. If
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017681_0013_0FA21E369F91F090"/>any body oppo≈øes them, they get round him, threaten him with damnation, ≈øtorm and ≈øtamp at him, ≈øtare open their eyes, pucker up their mouths, and cry oh! oh! oh! at him, and act all the po≈øtures of vengeance, which is enough to frighten a Hercules out of his wits.</p>
                  <p>Every one, as ≈øoon as they fall in with this new religion, immediately throw down their arms, and cry out again≈øt the means of defence made u≈øe of again≈øt the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and appear the mo≈øt ob≈øtinate again≈øt all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the country. I have heard ≈øome of them ≈øay, that all our authority, civil and military, is from hell, and would go there again. The effect of this ≈øcheme is ≈øuch, that men and their wives have parted, children run away from their parents, and ≈øociety entirely broke up in neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoods; it makes children deny and di≈øown their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and ≈øay they are full of devils. They are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually throwing out their cur≈øes on all that do not fall in with them; prophe≈øying the de≈øtruction of the country; declaring they belong to the kingdom of God, and at the ≈øame time, if they are a≈øked whether they are born again they will ≈øay nay. If any per≈øon goes to rea≈øon with them, they immediately put their ≈øingers in their ears, or run off out of hearing, or el≈øe drown him with clamour, noi≈øe and cur≈øes: And as their teachers advi≈øe and order children to run away from parents, and men to ≈øhut their doors again≈øt their own brethren, by blood, and refu≈øe them any admi≈ø≈øion into their hou≈øes; all their orders are punctually obeyed.</p>
                  <p>They make great dependence on their ≈øigns, and ≈øay it is the power of God, and God has taken that way to preach by them: One of them had a ≈øign, that a certain man had committed murder, and charged him with it, which the man denied; he again had a ≈øign, that a certain man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to kill two children and their mother, on a certain night; then he had a ≈øign for two of his a≈ø≈øociates to go and lie all night behind the hou≈øe, and watch for him, and when they heard the children cry, to ru≈øh in, take the man and bind him, and bring the man to him; the two men o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017681_0014_0FA21E3927A55290"/>his orders, believing in his ≈øign: About break of day he had a ≈øign, that they catched the man and bound him; however, in the morning, the two men returned having not ≈øeen the man. Thus their ≈øigns in general prove fal≈øe; however they get out this way, that the ≈øign is true, but that they made a fal≈øe interpretation. I knew another, who under the operation of the ≈øpirit prophe≈øied, that at the end of two weeks, New-London would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed, and at the end of four weeks, Albany would be burnt, and the next day the world would be at an end; all which proved fal≈øe. Another had a ≈øign, that a certain man, on ≈øuch a day, would kill him, and on the third day he ≈øhould ri≈øe again into life and action; which likewi≈øe proved fal≈øe. One of their po≈øtures which increa≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, is turning round very ≈øwift for an hour, and ≈øometimes for two hours at a time, until then are all wet with ≈øweat; this they ≈øay is to ≈øhew the great power of God.</p>
                  <p>They meet together in the night, and have been heard two miles by the people, in the dead of the night; ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a company of them will run away to ≈øome hou≈øe, get into it, rai≈øe a bedlam, wake up all in the hou≈øe, and the neighbours round about for a mile: They run about in the woods and el≈øewhere, hooting and tooting like owls; ≈øome of them have ≈øtripped naked in the woods, and thought they were angels, and invi≈øible, and could go about among men and not be ≈øeen, and have lo≈øt their clothes, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found them again. Sometimes while eating at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they ≈øay their dead parents and brethren come on the table and ≈øet on a pye, and they ≈øee them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>At one of their meetings they hung a woman by the neck, but took her down before ≈øhe was dead, to ≈øhew as a ≈øign, how they were to be per≈øecuted; and now while I am writing, I am informed by good authority, that two men in the ≈øcheme have murdered them≈øelves, one cut his throat, the other ≈øtabbed him≈øelf, after he had tried twice to kill his wife, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I might proceed much further, but it is as impo≈ø≈øible to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017681_0015_0FA21E3974F02F60"/>fully ≈øet forth the power and effect of this new religion, as to trace the airy road of the meteor; I therefore proceed.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. To ≈øhew what this new religion is, as pointed out by ≈øcripture te≈øtimony.</p>
                  <p>In opening this propo≈øition it will be nece≈ø≈øary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, on the great purpo≈øes of God, which will terminate in two grand events; fir≈øt, the deliverance of his people, and fulfilling his promi≈øes to them: Secondly, the de≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the man of ≈øin. The≈øe events will conclude and fini≈øh the reign of Antichri≈øt: And the work of God in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, has a ≈øpecial re≈øpect, both in his providence and grace, to the grand conclu≈øion.</p>
                  <p>Every age of the church have had their trials and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats, with the great enemy of God and his people; and as God's work and de≈øigns have advanced forward, ≈øo the power of the enemy has increa≈øed; and it is very evident, that the la≈øt ≈øtruggles of the enemy will be the mo≈øt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and dangerous; this God ≈øaw, and in his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs has adverti≈øed his people of the delu≈øions and errors that would take place in the la≈øt days; knowing that the crafty ≈øerpent would act over again, his ≈øubtil wiles, in the highe≈øt preten≈øions of the greate≈øt good. We are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Lord, in Matt. xxiv. 24. that fal≈øe Chri≈øts and fal≈øe prophets ≈øhall ari≈øe, and ≈øhall ≈øhew great ≈øigns and wonders in ≈øo much that if it were po≈ø≈øible, they ≈øhould deceive the very elect.</p>
                  <p>This matter is more fully opened and illu≈øtrated by the great apo≈øtle Paul, in his epi≈øtle to the The≈ø≈øalonians, ii. 3‚Äî12. he gives advice, not to be deceived; for the day of Chri≈øt ≈øhall not come, before there come fir≈øt a falling away; and that the man of ≈øin be revealed, whom he calls the ≈øon of perdition, who oppo≈øeth and exalteth him≈øelf above all that is called God, or that is wor≈øhipped: So that he as God ≈øitteth in the temple of God, ≈øhewing that he is God;‚Äîhe ≈øhews in the 7th ver≈øe, that it is the great my≈øtery of iniquity, who≈øe coming ≈øhall be after the working of ≈øatan, with all power, and ≈øigns and lying wonders, with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivablene≈øs of unrighteou≈øne≈øs, &amp;c. As this great delu≈øion

                  <p>It is very evident, that this is the very day in which this work of Satan is on the wheel: And notwith≈øtanding, it may appear unaccountable to every rational mind, that any of the human ≈øpecie ≈øhould fall in with ≈øo diabolical a ≈øcheme; yet when we con≈øider its fine dre≈øs of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the ≈øpirit of infatuation and witchcraft, that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, it may form our minds into a belief, that it can be and really is ≈øo.</p>
                  <p>It is further evident that Antichri≈øt cannot appear in any other light or path, but only that which Chri≈øt and his Apo≈øtles has marked out for it.‚ÄîI will therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the works and character of Antichri≈øt with this new and ≈øtrange religion, as it is delineated and ≈øet forth.</p>

The Apo≈øtle Paul, in his ≈øecond epi≈øtle to Timothy, iii. 1‚Äî9, points out this very people, in this new religion, and ≈øhews they were to appear in the la≈øt day, bearing the character of God's enemies. Again, in 1 Tim. iv. 1, 2, 3. The Holy Gho≈øt points out the doctrines of this new religion, and calls them the doctrines of devils, which are taught them by ≈øeducing ≈øpirits. Again, 2 Peter, ii. 1, 2, 3. Their here≈øies are ≈øpoken of, and of their denying the Lord that bought them. Nothing is more evident than that the Apo≈øtle points out this very people, for they throw away their conver≈øion and begin to repent of their ≈øin which they committed in their childhood; and thus to attone and make ≈øatisfaction, and ≈øtep up the ladder of their own works, into a ≈øtate of perfection; but if death ≈øhould overtake them before they get to be perfect, then down to hell they mu≈øt go, to pay the remainder in ≈øuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and when they have paid the debt and are born again in hell, then to come out and go to Heaven; will they thank Chri≈øt, as the great mediator, and adore him, for his attoning blood and righteou≈øne≈øs? No, not at all; Oh, dreadful ≈øcheme, that ≈øtands oppo≈øed to the glorious plan of redemption by Chri≈øt! Well might Peter and Jude ≈øay of them, wells without water, clouds without rain, twice dead, pluckt up by the roots, wandering ≈øtars; for whom is re≈øerved the blackne≈øs of darkne≈øs for ever. Again,</p>
                  <p>I find this new religion differs from the true religion of the go≈øpel, re≈øpecting ≈øaith.</p>
                  <p>I find go≈øpel religion ≈øays, being ju≈øtified by faith, Rom. v. 1. but this new religion ≈øays by works.‚ÄîTo decide this matter, I ≈øhall attend to the Apo≈øtle, in Rom. iv. 4, 5. where he ≈øays, <hi>To him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt;‚Äîbut to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that ju≈øtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteou≈øne≈øs.</hi> The true Chri≈øtian ≈øees by saith, lives by faith, walks by faith, fights the good fight of faith, and gets the victory by faith: But the people in this new religion, do not ≈øo much as talk about faith in Chri≈øt, but they place their whole knowledge in their religion, on their pretended vi≈øions, prophe≈øies and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017681_0018_0FA21E3EEC90F750"/>≈øigns.‚ÄîAnother thing which proves this new religion to be fal≈øe, is what follows.‚ÄîThe Apo≈øtle James, in his epi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle i. 5, ≈øays, <hi>If any of you lack wi≈ødom, let him a≈øk of God who giveth liberally.</hi> But this people go to Ni≈øqueunia, to a≈øk of a number of Europeans, what they ≈øhall do ‚Äî who tell them, agreeable to what I find 2 Peter, ii. 18, 19. They ≈øpeak great ≈øwelling words of vanity, and allure through their much wantonne≈øs, tho≈øe that were clean e≈øcaped, from them who live in error; and while they promi≈øed them liberty, they them≈øelves are the ≈øervants of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.‚ÄîAnd further, in≈øtead of attending to the worthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions of our Godly teachers, they are burning all the books of divinity, and learning, they come at.‚ÄîIn this new religion is the whole magazine of error, trea≈øured up in the great my≈øtery of iniquity, in which is found all the power of delu≈øive witchcraft, to blindfold ≈øouls, and lead them to hell. I might cite a multitude of ≈øcripture in proof of this point, but ≈øhall only ≈øay, the whole canon of God's word is levelled again≈øt this new religion, and doth and will eternally conderin it, and all its propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ≈øhall not be able to ≈øtand the trial; with which I clo≈øe this head and proceed,</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. To give ≈øome rea≈øons for my knowledge in this new religion, not by mere ≈øpeculation, but ≈øorrowful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
                  <p>On the 13th day of May la≈øt, I received a reque≈øt from a church at Stillwater, above Albany, to attend on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the 25th day of the ≈øame month; and being di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to go, two of my brethren offered to bear me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, provided I would return back by the way of Ni≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queunia with them, to ≈øee a new and ≈øtrange people living there. I con≈øented to their propo≈øition, in con≈øequence of their company in my journey, and on the 26th day of May la≈øt we arrived at Ni≈øqueunia: The Europeans, though ≈øtrangers, received us very kindly, and pre≈øently told us they knew of our coming the day before; this ≈øet me to wondering at their knowledge. After they had got us ≈øome victuals, one of them came and ≈øat down by me,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017681_0019_0FA21E3FA3A0BE28"/>and began to ≈øpeak many good words, ≈øaying, I mu≈øt hate ≈øin, love God, and take up my cro≈øs, &amp;c. then went on to tell about a new di≈øpen≈øation, and that they had got into it; his words ≈øeemed ≈øo well placed, that I heard them with attention: Mean while a man, one of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ≈øtands up before me, and began to ≈øtretch and bend, and extend his arms up and down, and to act all manner of po≈øtures, and turn his eyes almo≈øt in≈øide out; I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øeen or heard of ≈øuch actions before, and it ≈øet me a wondering what he meant. By this time my mind was much engaged, attending to one that ≈øpoke good words, and to the other that acted ≈øo oddly. Mean while he that ≈øpoke drew near to me, and every little while would touch me with his finger; but I thought it was that I might mind well what he ≈øaid; he likewi≈øe would give me a ≈øly cro≈øs, and put his hand on my head or about me, which I took not much notice of. The mother, ≈øo called, looked very ≈ømiling, came and ≈øat down, and began to ≈øing a ≈øtrange tune, with a my≈øtical voice, in a mixture of words, known and unknown, which ≈øeemed to be a perfect charm.</p>
                  <p>After they had been the object of attention for ≈øome time, I turned my thoughts on my former views of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and found, to my admiration, my mind was turned wholly up-≈øide down; and began to think I had been all my life in a dream about religion.‚ÄîAfter a further di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their wor≈øhip, I felt greatly ≈øhocked and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet a ≈øecret belief kept prevailing, that they were the people of God. I tarried all night, but ≈øat up, hearing and ≈øeeing tho≈øe ≈øtrange things until the break of day, in which time they gave me a hint of their purgatory ≈øcheme, which greatly ≈øhocked my mind: In this tumult of thought I left them in the morning, about eight o'clock, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home.</p>
                  <p>In a very ≈øhort time I found a power come on me, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what I had ever felt before, and made me feel very weak and maugre, and in a little time it ≈øo affected my nerves that they gave a twich, as ≈øudden as a fla≈øh of lightning; at fir≈øt I thought what can that be? But imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017681_0020_0FA21E408E4B4D40"/>the an≈øwer was ready, It is the power of God: This made me give way to it, daring not to re≈øi≈øt it, and immediately it gave me another twitch; it had this effect on me, to make me attend to the power, and in ≈øo doing I thought I attended on God: It never brought me to what they call ≈øigns, and to ≈øo great ≈øhaking as ≈øome have; however, I fully believed it was the work of God, and yet I found great difficulties to get along; to give up my old experience, appeared a great thing, and to hold them was contrary to the ≈øcheme. However, I reconciled my difficulties as well as I could, by concluding, that in the new di≈øpen≈øation, new things would appear, and greater light would ≈øhine, and whatever was wanting in my old experience would now appear; yet ≈øo far as they went they might be good; yet many told me, I would ever be weak in the new, until I threw away all the old.</p>
                  <p>I went again to Nu≈øqueunia and received further in≈øtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Europeans, and ≈øeemed to be more confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Having given them a relation of my life, they made me many large promi≈øes of very great ble≈ø≈øings and ≈øtill I remained under the operation of the ≈øpirit.‚ÄîBut in a little time the effect of this new work in many, appeared ≈øo wild that it troubled me much, and I thought it my duty to ≈øever between the precious and the vile; which when I began to do, they ro≈øe upon me with a di≈ømal hi≈øs, and had a ≈øign to ≈øtop me; however, I went through again≈øt their ≈øigns; and as the work went on, more incon≈øi≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and fal≈øhoods appeared, which made me repeat a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of ≈øuch things, and made mention of ≈øome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections I have ≈øeen in their teachers; this made them ri≈øe in ≈øuch a clamour, hi≈øs and uproar, as though the infernal den had broke loo≈øe: This gave me ≈øuch a ≈øhock, that I could go no further until I had examined the ≈øcheme over again. For this purpo≈øe I attended to my Bible more carefully, and my eyes began to be opened, and the power on me began to decrea≈øe; but had great threatnings ≈øent to me from the teachers and others; telling me if I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back, damnation was my portion.‚ÄîTheir prophe≈øies
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017681_0021_0FA21E40F80A38D0"/>and their ≈øigns appeared more and fal≈øe fal≈øe, which ≈øtill opened my eyes, and gave me great jealou≈øy, that this new religion was led by a fal≈øe ≈øpirit, and in a little time the operation wholly left me; my eyes were wide open, and I was as though I had come out of a dark cellar, into the brighte≈øt beams of the noon day ≈øun.</p>
                  <p>I am very ≈øen≈øible, that the ≈øpirit which leads on this new ≈øcheme, is the ≈øpirit of witchcraft, and is the mo≈øt powerful of any delu≈øion I ever heard or read of except what I find in Acts viii. 9, 10, 11. It I have been in any mea≈øure a means of leading any per≈øon into this wicked and dreadful delu≈øion, I am very ≈øorry, and as I heartily repent of my folly, I a≈øk the forgivene≈øs of all, e≈øpecially tho≈øe, that like my≈øelf, have been attending to creatures in≈øtead of lookin to God.</p>
                  <p>Having thus given a ≈øhort, but true relation, of this new religion, in its ≈øeveral parts, together with my real and ab≈øolute knowledge of the ≈øame, by ≈øorrowful experience, I pa≈øs on to the 9th, and la≈øt propo≈øition, viz.

                     <p>DEAR SIRS,</p>
                     <p>THERE never was a day that more loudly called for faithful watchmen, than the pre≈øent time; while we ≈øee Satan transforming him≈øelf into an angel of light, and bringing forward his deep laid ≈øcheme, to undermine the glorious plan of Redemption by Chri≈øt: And as he at fir≈øt deceived the woman, and made u≈øe of her to delude the man; ≈øo he is playing his old prank over again, ≈øending one woman from the State of New-York, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the State of Rhode-I≈øland, who vie with each other, and are as dangerous to the heedle≈øs pa≈ø≈øenger as Scilla and Charibdes are to the un≈økilful mariner. O then! what need is there of ≈økilful pilots and experienced helm≈ømen, to ≈øteer the ≈øhip of Zion, and keep her in the true channel of faith and love to God.</p>
                     <p>The battle is now begun, Michael and his angels, and the dragon and his angels are now formed one again≈øt the other, for the grand deci≈øion. Now, we may expect the whole artillery of the infernal den, charged with error, delu≈øion and bla≈øphemy, attending with all the power of helli≈øh fury, in the la≈øt ≈øtruggle of the enemy.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore, you are to fight again≈øt all the powers of darkne≈øs, and with≈øtand Satan not only in his malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant rage and envy, but al≈øo in his deceitful flatteries and counterfeit friend≈øhip. For the old enemy of God and his people, like a grand politician, will try every method, by power, fraud and lies, to carry his diabolical de≈øigns
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017681_0023_0FA21E4286C110A0"/>into execution.‚ÄîYou need therefore the whole armour of God, that you may be able to with≈øtand, and having done all to ≈øtand; but there is no fear to them that put their tru≈øt in Chri≈øt, who will again come up from the fields of Edom, glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatne≈øs of his ≈øtrength, and will trample his enemies in his fury, and ≈øprinkle his garments with the blood of his enemies. You know your leader and where your ≈øtrength lies; it is your duty to attend clo≈øely to his directions, that you may be powerful in your warfare, to pull down the ≈øtrong holds of ≈øin and Satan, and in ≈øo doing ≈øave your≈øelves and them who hear you, and at la≈øt receive a crown of righteou≈øne≈øs, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give at that day.</p>

                     <p>I now turn my≈øelf to the people in general. My dear countrymen, I am deeply affected at the fearful omens of impending de≈øtruction that ≈øo loudly threaten our bleeding land. Surely God is angry, and the tokens of his di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure are plainly di≈øcovered. It is a day that calls for lamentation and mourning, repentence and reformation; it is for our ≈øin that God has permitted the ≈øword to be un≈øheathed upon us; and tyranny to clank its chains and threaten us with ≈ølavery. Notwith≈øtanding it was our duty to look to God for help, and in an humble depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on him to ≈øtand forth in our defence, again≈øt a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el enemy; yet how has our armies degenerated into nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeries of impiety, and the contagious di≈øtemper that we have been oppo≈øing, ≈øpread it≈øelf in our land?

How many traiterous plans have been formed for our blood and trea≈øure, by a banditti of infernal mi≈øcreants? And notwith≈øtanding God has prevented, and his good providence bla≈øted the de≈øigns of tho≈øe Cains <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

                     <p>The great enemy of God that has filled the world with uproar, war and death, has ever envied the recovery of man, by a glorious mediator; and has ever been trying to circumvent the merciful de≈øigns of God, through Chri≈øt, for the ≈øalvation of ≈øouls. And in addition to all his ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile wiles, he takes the advantage of the great decay of religion and virtue, and makes it his opportunity to play his magic games, attended with the doctrine of purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the wor≈øhip of the creature in≈øtead of the creator, and an earthly and creature tribunal, to bring the whole creation of men to trial. The ≈øcheme is ≈øo naked and balled, with all its ≈øplendid ≈øhew of perfection, that every rational mind would recoil at the thought of falling in with ≈øuch a diabolical plan, was it not for a bewitching power that attends it, which turns every thing up≈øide down, and puts darkne≈øs for light, error for truth, bitter for ≈øweet, and hell for Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Multitudes have fallen in with this dreadful ≈øcheme, and are ≈øo infatuated in their ≈øen≈øes, that they are depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their rea≈øon, and pa≈øt recovery, unle≈øs God interpo≈øe for them. While the leaders of this dreadful cata≈øtrophe, like the bowels of Aetna, are ever vomiting up their ≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; like wild-fire it flies, and catches at a di≈øtance, and ≈øpreads like a plague. For ≈øuch a delu≈øion to take place in the land, loudly proclaims the judgment of God. For a people to be carried away with the power of error, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpeaks their great darkne≈øs and ignorance of the truth.</p>
                     <p>Men, Brethren, and Fathers, ≈øuffer me to addre≈øs you with a word of advice. One great end and de≈øign of this piece is to timely adverti≈øe you of the growing evils that
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017681_0025_0FA21E43F47C2458"/>are prevailing in our land, e≈øpecially the fatal delu≈øion ≈øet forth in this narrative. Con≈øider the great and noble end of your creation. You were not made to be the meer play-things of time, nor to furni≈øh Satan with materials to carry on his dark de≈øigns and horrid intrigues again≈øt the Mo≈øt High, but to honour and glorify God. Therefore, for this great end and purpo≈øe break off from ≈øin of every kind, encourage religion and virtue in each other; carefully attend to the doctrine and advice of your godly teachers; lift up your hearts in your de≈øires to God, for his holy ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to enlighten and lead you into the truth; clo≈øely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the word of God; make it the man of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel. Let all your conduct ≈øpeak forth your belief of the Deity, and judgment to come; and by becoming holy we ≈øhall be a happy people, and ≈øhall ≈øee the return of God's ble≈ø≈øings, Satan di≈øappointed and bla≈øted, and the glorious kingdom of Chri≈øt advancing. I clo≈øe my addre≈øs to you, by heartily recommending to your ≈øerious con≈øideration the great duty of guarding again≈øt tho≈øe dangerous errors, and de≈øtructive delu≈øions, which lead the mi≈øguided ≈øoul into the endle≈øs mazes and winding labyrinths of trouble and ≈øorrow.</p>
                     <p>And may God pre≈øerve you and lead you to him≈øelf, through faith in Je≈øus Chri≈øt, with which I clo≈øe, and ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribe my≈øelf the publick's real friend, and humble ≈øervant,</p>

                  <p>WHEN the people on this I≈øland began ≈øome time ago to enter into A≈ø≈øociations, in order to defeat the ≈øchemes of wicked and corrupt rulers, the King and his Mini≈øters were much alarmed. A Cabinet Council was held at Whitehall in con≈øequence thereof. There were pre≈øent among others his Maje≈øty, Lord Bute (<hi>under the ro≈øe</hi>) Lord North, Lord Germaine, Lord Mansfield, and a well known toryi≈øtical Bi≈øhop. After the debates on this important bu≈øine≈øs were over; the following conver≈øati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Dialogue took place, which laid that ≈øcene of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance and confu≈øion, which lately took place in this Metropolis, and by which ≈øo many innocent per≈øons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately lo≈øt their lives: By this conference we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo led to the di≈øcovery of a low and contemptible ≈øcheme for rai≈øing commotions and di≈øturbing the peace of our brethren in America, by introducing a new, ≈øtrange and fooli≈øh religion, which, unaccountable as it may ≈øeem, it is ≈øaid has already created much mi≈øchief in that quarter. The conver≈øation was began by his Maje≈øty, and was neaily as follows, viz.</p>

                     <p>Very true, may it plea≈øe your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty, and you cannot be too ≈øen≈øible of the great danger of ≈øuch unlawful combinations.</p>

                     <p>The≈øe are the very mea≈øures which were taken by the Americans in the beginning of their rebellion. Your Maje≈øty may recollect their regular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in this way. Ten thou≈øand mobs could not have done half ≈øo much injury to this Kingdom.</p>

                     <p>It is a ju≈øt maxim, That de≈øperate di≈øea≈øes require de≈øperate remedies. Mobs, may it plea≈øe your Maje≈øty, often produce the be≈øt effects; they tend to ≈øtrengthen government, and in their con≈øequences to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the oppo≈øition of the people, as they introduce anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and confu≈øion, whereby the more ≈øerious and ≈øen≈øible part of the community are plundered and ill-treated, which will make them rather ≈øubmit to ≈øome ≈ømall infringement of their liberties, than to be harra≈ø≈øed by a mob rai≈øed out of the lowe≈øt and mo≈øt abandoned of the people; and even acknowledge that ab≈øolute government is better than none.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:017681_0029_0FA21E471BF99B18"/>this important matter‚Äîif you think it worthy of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you will plea≈øe to point out the means of redre≈øs.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>May it plea≈øe your Maje≈øty, we really think it expedient to rai≈øe a mob chiefly out of the lower ≈øort of the people, to be headed by a per≈øon of ≈øome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence. This riotous a≈ø≈øembly when rai≈øed may ea≈øily be led to commit ≈øuch outrages as will alarm all the ≈øober and more ≈øen≈øible part of the nation, who will then wi≈øh for and reque≈øt the interpo≈øition of government. Let mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary power be exerted in a proper moment‚Äîa few of the mo≈øt worthle≈øs be taken, and after trial executed, and at the ≈øame time extend mercy to a few who are the lea≈øt attrocious. The riot will then ≈øub≈øide‚Äîa new face will appear upon our political affairs‚Äîthe different pa≈ø≈øions of the people will be wrought upon‚Äîthe moderate men will have more influence upon tho≈øe in oppo≈øition‚Äîthe digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of government will acquire new lu≈øtre‚Äîtho≈øe in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition will loo≈øe ground‚Äîand finally all their plea≈øing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations from A≈ø≈øociations, &amp;c. will vani≈øh like the dew upon the ri≈øing of the morning ≈øun.</p>

                     <p>Your ≈øcheme appears ≈øomething plau≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble‚ÄîBut how can the matter be properly conducted? For it appears to me to be an exceeding delicate affair.</p>

                     <p>May it plea≈øe your Maje≈øty, ≈øome tru≈øty per≈øon or per≈øons mu≈øt be employed who are favourites of the people;‚Äîyour Maje≈øty's faithful mini≈øters have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had a conference with Lord Gordon‚Äîhe has the petition of the prote≈øtant a≈ø≈øociation in tru≈øt, to pre≈øent to your Maje≈øty and Parliament again≈øt the bill of Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, &amp;c. His character an≈øwers to a hair.‚ÄîHe has agreed if your Maje≈øty approves the mea≈øure, to i≈ø≈øue an adverti≈øement, inviting the people to attend him in pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the petition; and we have agreed with a number of
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:017681_0030_0FA21E47D77182B8"/>cunning, artful fellows to influence the mob ≈øo a≈ø≈øembled to burn a few buildings, &amp;c. at which time we can ≈øet on our dogs of war, &amp;c.</p>

                     <speaker>Lord Bute.</speaker>
                     <p>And one thing more mu≈øt be done, the leading magi≈øtrates in the city mu≈øt be brought into the ≈øecret, otherwi≈øe they will blow up our whole ≈øcheme by rai≈øing the <hi>po≈ø≈øe comitatus</hi> on the fir≈øt appearance of Lord Gordon's adverti≈øement.</p>

                     <p>That's right, a better plan could not be devi≈øed.‚ÄîI thank you my good friends. As for Lord Gordon I will make him ≈øhine in due time; he is young and may live to enjoy his earnings.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Mansfield.</speaker>
                     <p>We have a≈ø≈øured Lord Gordon that his popularity will be equal to his mo≈øt ≈øanguine expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions‚Äîand he appears to be well ≈øatisfied with the idea of being the darling of the people. Something, however, mu≈øt be done to bring him off from that puni≈øhment, which in the eye of the law he will ju≈øtly merit. It will be proper that he undergo confinement, and ≈øtand a trial for his life; but matters being properly managed, there will be no danger of his ≈øuffering a greater evil than a confinement for a ≈øhort time, and we make no doubt but he will receive full compen≈øation for that inconvenience by your Maje≈øty's royal bounty.</p>

                     <p>He may rely on my a≈ø≈øi≈øtance‚Äîand I think the ≈øooner this plan is put in execution the better.</p>

                     <speaker>Lord Germaine.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Lord Germaine.</speaker>
                     <p>The people in Great-Britain are plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the notion of our having a right to tax America; they think it will help to relieve them of their burthens; be≈øides an Engli≈øh chimney-≈øweeper plumes him≈øelf on his Engli≈øh blood, and thinks he has a right to govern and make laws for America.</p>

                     <p>I fear, may it plea≈øe your Maje≈øty that all our money, blood and trea≈øure expended there is lo≈øt, and

The money we have expended in bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øeems to have had but little good effect, but few of tho≈øe we have retained appear to act conformable to our wi≈øhes; they ≈øeem to have but little courage to ≈øtand forth in the defence of our intere≈øt.</p>

                     <p>We mu≈øt make ≈øome allowance for that, our affairs are ≈øo ruinous there, that they ≈øee they ≈øtand a great chance to be hanged or be obliged to leave their country forever, and ≈øelf-pre≈øervation is one of the fir≈øt laws of nature we all know: But we mu≈øt make u≈øe of every ≈øtratagem; we find they an≈øwer when nothing el≈øe will. My Lord <hi>Germaine</hi> has lately had intelligence from ≈øome agents we have lately ≈øent to America, to work upon the ≈øuper≈øtition of the people there. They have had tolerable ≈øucce≈øs. My Lord will inform your Maje≈øty concerning them.</p>

                     <p>May it plea≈øe your Maje≈øty, our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts from the per≈øons who were ≈øent to propagate a new religions ≈øcheme in America are very flattering. They make converts daily, and it is merry to hear of the weakne≈øs and folly of their tenets, and how aptly adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work on the fooli≈øh and ≈øuper≈øtitious pa≈ø≈øions of the mo≈øt ignorant of the Americans. You mu≈øt note, Sir, they have ever been taught to believe in miracles and ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural operations. Their leaders, our agents, who ≈øtile them≈øelves elders, profe≈øs to have all the≈øe powers, viz. To heal the ≈øick, lame, wounded, &amp;c. to have the gift of prophe≈øy, divine revelations, and of conver≈øing in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongues, &amp;c. and to be perfect and infallible; the ≈øpirit, as they term it, works upon and agitates their whole bodies; they have holy dances, turnings, ≈øhakings of the head and limbs, fall down and have terrible agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and many excel ≈øo much in the≈øe things, e≈øpecially their converts, that they appear meagre, pale, and their vi≈øages gha≈øtly; they are taught that they mu≈øt confe≈øs their ≈øins to their elders, and at ≈øuch times are inquired of, Whether they have been guilty of taking up arms, which
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:017681_0032_0FA21E493367A718"/>is repre≈øented as the greate≈øt ≈øin; whether they have been guilty of carnal knowledge with brutes; whether they have been guilty of whoredom, and with how many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; whether they have had carnal knowledge of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in her pregnancy, &amp;c. and at the confe≈ø≈øion of each ≈øin kneel and put up ejaculations to Heaven for pardon: The wretched converts to this religion, flock after their teachers, and at certain places are entertained on free co≈øt, and are led to believe that the means of their ≈øupport is furni≈øhed in a miraculous manner: This religion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible as it may appear, is calculated to infatuate weak minds; and tho≈øe who are but little acquainted with the con≈øtruction of the human body, really think the teachers of this ≈øcheme have power from Heaven to work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and never con≈øider that the violent agitations of their bodies in the execi≈øe of their ab≈øurd ≈øhakings, will in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ca≈øes give a fre≈øh ≈øpring to the blood, and cau≈øe a circulation in parts which were before ob≈øtructed; and by means of which people who were before lame, may chance by the violent frenzy they have worked them≈øelves into, cau≈øe a circulation to take place in a lame limb, and and thereby recover the u≈øe of it; this is held up as a real miracle, and does not fail to bring over fre≈øh converts, particularly of tho≈øe who≈øe nerves are weak. They are taught to believe that the time draws near when the whole of the ≈øaints ≈øhall be ≈øealed, and when the remaining wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, among whom are tho≈øe who have taken arms again≈øt us, ≈øhall be de≈øtroyed, to make room for the ≈øaints to reign with Chri≈øt a thou≈øand years. They are great adepts in the u≈øe of the ≈øcriptures, and never fail to interpret it directly to their purpo≈øe. The≈øe people, if properly increa≈øed, might be worked up to any thing, and to any purpo≈øe by their leaders, on whom they ≈øolely depend for direction, only let them have a divine revelation to take arms and de≈øtroy rebels to God, and rebels to man; but I fear we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt too late in this affair‚Äîwe ≈øhould have began ≈øooner‚Äîbut it may be that we may yet u≈øe the≈øe Shaking
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:017681_0033_0FA21E49F3864AD8"/>Quakers, as they are called, to good advantage‚ÄîI look upon them at lea≈øt <hi>late</hi> recruits for Britain.</p>

                     <p>I have often been told that the people in ≈øome of the colonies were great bigots in their religion; e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the di≈ø≈øenters‚ÄîI am ≈øomewhat ≈øurpri≈øed that the≈øe Shaking Quakers ≈øhould have any influence on them, e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially as they are reputed to be foremo≈øt in the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and great oppo≈øers to any religious ≈øcheme that bears any re≈øemblance to popery.‚ÄîNow, if I am rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, this new ≈øcheme bears a ≈øtrong re≈øemblance in many particulars to the catholick church‚Äîfor in≈øtance, their profe≈ø≈øion of being perfect, infallible, confe≈ø≈øions of ≈øin, bodily agitations, out-≈øide ≈øhews, &amp;c. this an≈øwers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the mother papal church, together with their power of working miracles, &amp;c. However, if we can but get this ≈øcheme to go down, it will have, I believe, a good tendency to cut the ≈øinews of their rebellion, as the numerous converts will refu≈øe to bear arms again≈øt the forces ≈øent to ≈øubdue the Americans by your Maje≈øty.</p>

                     <p>May it plea≈øe your Maje≈øty, we may ≈øee by the ea≈øy manner in which the Americans are taken and duped by tho≈øe ≈øhakers, that the bulk of the people there were never fited by wi≈ødom and virtue for freemen; ≈øuch ignorant and ≈øtupid wretches ought never to be free‚Äîthey never acted from any principle of knowledge, founded in their under≈øtandings, in their rebellion and oppo≈øition to our government; they were dictated by only a few ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative men who fore≈øaw the evil of our claims of making laws for them in all ca≈øes what≈øoever.</p>

                     <p>But, Sir, you mu≈øt acknowledge that ≈øome of our laws; by which their charters were almo≈øt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, and they ≈øubjected to be brought to England for trial, &amp;c. might be ≈øeen through by weak minds.</p>

                     <p>That's true, Sir, and were intended to be ≈øeen by the commonality, you know, Sir, we had our aims by drawing them into rebellion, but con≈øequences have turned out contrary to our expectations.</p>

                     <p>True, gentlemen‚ÄîI have been waiting for the joyful news of the conque≈øt of the rebels in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and expecting it as a con≈øequence of your councils and mea≈øures, but have been continually di≈øappointed; it is a≈ø≈øurance, gentlemen, that I want, that the work will be ≈øoon compleated, and for the want of ≈øuch a≈ø≈øurance, my ≈øoul is almo≈øt ≈øtarved. Shall it be ≈øaid, that in the reign of George the Third, a native born King of Britain, that America was torn from his Crown! Forbid it Heaven! Forbid it Earth, and all the powers of darkne≈øs: Rather than ≈øuch an event ≈øhould take place, I would wi≈øh that the whole continent of America might be ≈øunk into the bottom of the ocean, or con≈øumed like Sodom with fire and brim≈øtone, and every cur≈øed rebel in it.</p>
