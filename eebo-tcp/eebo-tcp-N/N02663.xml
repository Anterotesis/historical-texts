            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend and Dear Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Glory of <hi>God,</hi> and Interest of Religion, having been the Motives of your publishing your Reasons for a <hi>Subscription</hi> to the <hi>Westminster Confession, &amp;c.</hi> You cannot be displeased with me, if from the same Motives, I offer some Objections against the proposed <hi>Subscription,</hi> and your Arguments to perswade it.</p>
            <p>I have nothing to object against your appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publickly in this Case: For, if <hi>Subscription</hi> be a Duty, and the Cause you espouse be the Cause of God, (as you seem very confident that it is) it must be a commendable Zeal, that prompts you to be extensively useful and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, in such an important Affair. I shall therefore make no Remarks upon your <hi>Apology,</hi> for the Publication of the <hi>Overture</hi> and <hi>Preface</hi>:
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003156_0003_0FF081A387BE50A8"/>
But immediately enter upon the Merits of the Cause, and consider,</p>
            <p>Whether it is the Duty of our <hi>Synod, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and Authoritatively to adopt the Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Confession of Faith and Catechisms,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and to oblige their Members, and every Candidate for the Ministry within their Bounds, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe them?</hi> This you hold in the Affirmative, and have endeavoured to prove. But either you have wanted Success in that Attempt, or I am so unhappy as not to see the Force of your Arguments.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore, with all that Candour and Respect that is due to you, as a <hi>Christian</hi> and a <hi>Minister</hi> of the Gospel, offer you the Reasons of my Dissent from your Proposal, by first taking some Notice of the Arguments for estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing your Opinion, both in the <hi>Overture</hi> and <hi>Preface,</hi> then, by stating my own Objections, and occasionally considering what occurs in your Discourse, to obviate them.</p>
            <p>The Argument that claims my first Notice, is in the first and second Pages of the <hi>Overture,</hi> which may be thus summed up.</p>
            <p>That <hi>it's the unquestionable Duty of every Christian, according to his Station, especialy of every Gospel Minister, and not of them only; but of every Gospel Church as an Organized Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy politic, to maintain and defend the Truths of the Gospel against all Opposition; and also to endeavour to perpetuate and propagate them unto Posterity, pure and uncorrupt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:003156_0003_0FF081A387BE50A8"/>But what Consequence would you draw from hence? Is the debated <hi>Subscription</hi> therefore necessary; because it's the only, or the most probable Means to answer these Ends? This I think must be your Meaning, or else your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is inconclusive. But then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's the unquestionable Duty of <hi>every Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian according to his Station,</hi> to subscribe the Westminster Confession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For <hi>it is their unquestionable Duty</hi> (as you observe) <hi>to maintain and defend the Truths of the Gospel against all Opposition.</hi> And consequently their unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Duty, to submit to, and comply with, the necessary Means to that End. You should therefore move for on <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Synod,</hi> that all the Ministers within our Bounds, enjoin a <hi>Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon every Member of their respective Congregations; and that too upon Pain of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion from their sacred Fellowship. A just Penalty for an open Defyance to <hi>unquestionable Duty.</hi> For, (to use your own Words, p. 21.) <hi>it's utterly impracticable for those of subscribing Principles, to take the Measures which these Principles oblige them unto, in order to their Defence against the Dangers of encroaching Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and at the same Time to drop this Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; by way of Compliance with those</hi> (Members of their Congregation) <hi>of non-subscribing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceples.</hi> It's true this Method would put our Congregations into utmost Confusion, it would (to use your own Words) <hi>procure Rents and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions in our small In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

most pernicious and dangerous Consequence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christian Charity; and most obstructive to spiritual Edification.</hi> This indeed at first view, seems a formidable Objection. But you have taught me how to answer it. You <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</hi> (you tell us p. 12.) <hi>that this is in it self a proper Preventive and Antidote against Division, being a suitable Mean to bring a Church to be of one Mind, and one Iudgement; and if it should in the Event have other Effects, it is only by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,</hi> &amp;c. And again. <hi>If it be a Churches Duty as a Church</hi> (in which Sence surely it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the <hi>Congregations</hi> as well as the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) to declare unto the World, and unto one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the Principles of their Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>it's not the Fear or Danger of Division, that should deter from it.</hi> Thus Sir, if your Conclusion will follow from these Premises, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is unavoidable, that it's our Duty to maintain and defend the Truths of the Gospel, by Schisms, Contentions and Confusions; and even the total Subversion of our Congregations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this Argument prove any thing to the Purpose, it must also be a necessary Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that those Churches that want this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and enjoin no <hi>Subscription</hi> upon their Ministers, have no good and proper Means to maintain and defend the Truths of the Gospel, and propagate them to Posterity: But Nothing can be more contrary to Truth and Experience, than this Suppositi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>I believe it will prove a difficult Task, to find so much as a Proposal, much less an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Subscription,</hi> to any Formula what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever in the primitive Church, before <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the Great. They then found other Means to detect Heresies, to resist Gainsayers, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the Truth; and to keep the Church not only a <hi>Garden enclosed,</hi> but a Garden of Peace. The <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> did indeed impose <hi>Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>; but what was the Consequence, but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Schisms, Convulsions and Confusions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Church was crumbled into Parts and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, each uncharitably anathematizing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Never was the Church infested with such a Swarm of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Heresies,</hi> as sprung from that corrupt Fountain of Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and <hi>Subscription.</hi> The <hi>Arrians</hi> were not only strengthened in their Heresy, and encreas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Numbers by their Persecution; but there was quickly added to 'em, the black Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of <hi>Eustathians, Macedonians, Anomoioi, Eunomians, Photinians, Luciferians, Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphites, Donatists, Appollonarians, Dimeritae, Massiliani, Antidicomorianitae, Collyridiani, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangismonitae, Psathyrians, Euti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whence one Council was conveen'd after another, to draw up new <hi>Creeds,</hi> and impose new <hi>Subscriptions,</hi> until almost e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Article of Christianity was both condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

and established. This was the <hi>Mark</hi> set by Providence upon the first <hi>Subscription</hi> of this kind, that was ever imposed in the World; and this the Defence and Propagation of Truth that followed from it.</p>
            <p>I might exemplify this Case, by Instances of the same kind, in all the succeeding Ages of the Church, unto the present Time. I might particularly shew you, how this imposing and subscribing of <hi>Creeds,</hi> was both an Inlet to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and a continued Engine of Papal Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, after the <hi>Pope</hi> was mounted upon the <hi>Seven-headed Beast.</hi> I might also observe, on the contrary, how the <hi>Waldenses, Wickliffians, Lollards</hi> &amp;c. flourished in Purity of Doctrine and Discipline, defended and propagated the Truth pure and uncorrupt against the utmost Opposition of Hell and Earth, without any <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> or <hi>Subscription.</hi> But we need not look so far back, nor go farther from Home, than the Countries where you and I were born, to find brightest Examples of this kind. The Presbyterian Church in <hi>Ireland,</hi> subsisted some Ages in Peace and Purity, to the Honour of their Profession, and Envy of their malignant Enemies; and thus might they probably have continued, had not the Fire of <hi>Subscription</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed their Glory; and this Engine of Division broke them to pieces, disunited them in Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, in Comunion, and in Charity; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them the Grief of their Friends, and the Scorn of their Enemies. And on the other
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003156_0005_0FF081A87208B358"/>
Hand, the Churches of <hi>New-England</hi> have all continued from their first Foundation <hi>Non-subscribers</hi>; and yet retain their first Faith and Love. From all this I think it naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that <hi>Subscription</hi> is not Necessary for the Being, or Well-being of the Church; unless Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Seditions and Heresies, are necessary to that End,</p>
            <p n="3">3. I'm sure this Argument is very little to the Purpose if <hi>Subscriptions</hi> have no direct Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to mantain and defend the Truths of the Gospel; and propagate them uncorrupt to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It seems you were not aware of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; but have taken for granted, as a first Principle not to be debated, that <hi>Subscription</hi> is not only a means, but the best means to this End. You have built all your Superstructure upon this <hi>Postulatum</hi>; and therefore, if upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it proves a Sandy Foundation, you know the Fate of your whole Fabric. Let us then consider the Case a little. Let us view this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification you are for erecting about a poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceless <hi>Laish</hi>; and see whether it don't agree to that Description <hi>Neh.</hi> iv.3. <hi>If a Fox go up, he shall even break down this Stone Wall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You'll readily grant that there's no Need of Subscriptions, for confirming and establishing the sincere Christian and orthodox Professor in the true Faith. He is influenced with higher Motives, he is establish'd upon a more stable Foundation; and <hi>kept by the Power of God

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003156_0010_0FF081B55BB87F20"/>
the Church, especially with respect to <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Ministers,</hi> and all such as can be prov'd guilty of dangerous Errors. By a seasonable rejecting of whom, we may prevent the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of Immorality, or <hi>Heresy</hi> among us. In this Case we have also express Commands and Directions, in the <hi>Divine Oracles,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii.5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi.5. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> iii.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> iii.10.</p>
            <p>I wold lastly propose, that the Ministers of the Gospel be most diligent, faithful, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in the discharge of their awful Trust. That by their sedulous Application to their Work, they may instruct the ignorant, establish the wavering, and convince the erroneous. Or to sum up all in a Word, that they may be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to convert poor perishing Sinners to <hi>Christ,</hi> and thereby to have them built upon the <hi>Foundation of God that standeth sure.</hi> Such painful Address to our Business, join'd with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer for Success, is the proper Engine to subvert the Kingdom of Satan in all it's Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and to confirm and establish the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> among us.

            <p>Thus Sir, I have something particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered this first Argument; and I think fully answer'd whatever occurs in the <hi>Overture.</hi> For allowing <hi>that a Principal of spiritual Wisdom would direct the Church of Christ, to fortify it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self against all assaults</hi> that <hi>secret Bosom Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Truth, are as dangerous as any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</hi> Admit, that <hi>we are so a particular
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003156_0010_0FF081B55BB87F20"/>
Church, as not to be a Part of any particular Church in the World</hi>; that <hi>we are in no small Danger of being corrupted in Doctrinals</hi>; that <hi>we are too much like the People of</hi> Laish, <hi>in a careless defenceless Condition</hi>; that <hi>we are sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with many pernicious Corruptions in Doctrine</hi>; that <hi>our Poverty renders us uncapable to plant a Seminary of Learning among us</hi>; and that <hi>the Edge of our Zeal against prevailing Errors is blunted.</hi> If we allow all these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for our being upon our Defence, and for our endeavouring to propagate the Truths of the Gospel to Posterity: Yet it all makes nothing for the <hi>Subscription</hi> under Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if that ben't the proper Means to answer these Ends, which I think I have fully prov'd.</p>
            <p>Your second and last Argument, I find (in page 7.) thus propos'd. <hi>As it is observed in the Overture, we are an intire Church of our selves, so as not to be a Part of any particular Church in the World, with which we are join'd as a Part. Now every Collection of People, which are united together under a politic Body, whether ecclesiastical or civil, must have some Bond of Union, by which the several Parts are join'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to make or constitute them one entire whole</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. <hi>Now, until we fulfil the Intent of the following Overture, I am at a loss where to find a sufficient external Bond of Union, by which we are united,</hi> &amp;c. In answer to which, I shall offer these three Things to your Consideration. (1.) That there may be a sufficient <hi>Bond of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi>
               <pb n="20"
                   facs="unknown:003156_0011_0FF081B753C8DD78"

without Subscription. (2.) That we have already all the external <hi>Bond of Union,</hi> that the Scriptures require of us. (3.) That what has a natural Tendency to <hi>Disunion</hi> and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, can't (agreeable to the Laws of Charity) be prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. There may be a sufficient <hi>Bond of Union</hi> without <hi>Subscription.</hi> A joint Acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> for our common Head, of the sacred Scriptures for our Common Standard both in Faith and Practice; with a joint Agreement in the same essential and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Articles of Christianity, and the same Methods of Worship and Discipline, are a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient external <hi>Bond of Union,</hi> either for the Being or Well-being of any Church under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. To this you object. <hi>How is it possible for us to know concerning one another, or for others to know concerning us, in what Sence we take or understand the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c.? To which I answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By retorting the Objection upon you. How is it possible for us to know concerning one another, or for others to know concerning us, in what Sence we take or understand the <hi>Assembl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            <p n="2">2. It's possible for us to continue in strict Examination of Candidates for the Ministry, that by that Means we may discover whether they be orthodox or erroneous; and in what Sence they understand the Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's possible for us to reject <hi>Hereticks</hi> when
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003156_0011_0FF081B753C8DD78"/>
we find any such among us. For tho' we have no just claim to impose our Faith, and our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Scripture upon any Man; yet we have an undoubted Right to reject their Opinions, when we think them erroneous; and to refuse Communion with them in sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and even in the exercise of Church Government, when we suppose their <hi>Heresy</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them unqualified for it. This (as I've shewn above) is what the Scriptures enjoin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. And if these Scriptural Methods be due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended, what further external <hi>Bond of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion</hi> can be wanting? <hi>Profess'd Deists, Socinians, Armi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ians and Free-thinkers, can't be united to us in the same Church Government,</hi> as you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose p. 10. if these Rules of <hi>Christ</hi> be duely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>You object again, that an <hi>Erastian, who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses that Christ has left us at Liberty, to chuse what Form of Government we think most agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, may freely join with us in the actual Exercise of Presbyterian Government.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. Why not? I hope your Charity is hardly so restricted to those of our own Sentiments in this Matter, as to suppose this a <hi>damning Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy</hi>; or an <hi>Error</hi> that incapacitates for Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all Ordinances. And I can't see what Prejudice these can be to our Constitution, so long as they heartily join in our Methods of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline; and thereby declare 'em best for us, whether they believe 'em of <hi>Divine Right</hi> or not. Can't we live peaceably with those who live
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003156_0012_0FF081B90FCAD4D8"/>
peaceably with us, and join with us in consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and concerning the Interest of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom among us, without breaking in upon their Consciences; and destroying their Right of judging for themselves?</p>
            <p>I might here subjoin, that a view of this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair from the very Infancy of Christianity will convince us, that the Churches of <hi>Christ</hi> have been always better united, and every way more flourishing, when no other external <hi>Bond of Union</hi> but what is now propos'd, have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon 'em, than when they have been fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd with <hi>Subscriptions,</hi> and other Impositions and Institutions of human Invention; as I have something exemplified above.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We have already all the external Bond of Union, that the Scriptures require of us. We all of us for ought I know, have <hi>one Faith, one Lord, one Baptism,</hi> and one Discipline. And what more is needful? You indeed require, that we should all subscribe to one Confession: But does our Lord Jesus Christ require this?

            <p n="3">III. What has a natural Tendency to <hi>Dis-union</hi> and Division, can't (agreable to the Laws of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) be propos'd as a <hi>Bond of Union.</hi> What you have offer'd in answer to this, does Nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the present Case; because you <hi>apprehend Subscription a proper Antidote against Division; and if it should in the Event have other Effects, it's only by Accident</hi> (p. 12.)

            <p>I must first observe to you, that the requiring and enjoining any unscriptural Terms of Union or Communion, is a direct and natural Means to procure <hi>Rents</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> in the Church.

            <p>I can't but further observe to you under this Head, that we all of us know, that that Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under Debate, has been scrupled and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by many godly, learn'd, and faithful <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> of Christ; that it has made horrible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Confusions in other Churches, and that it's like to have the same sad Effects among our selves.

But I challenge you to bring one Word to evince your Certainty, that our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations are agreable to the Meaning of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost</hi>; and have the Divine Approbation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that any <hi>Sect</hi> under Heaven may n't bring in the same Case Suppose I was now debating with a <hi>Roman-Catholic,</hi> against Subscription to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent.</hi> He answers my Objection in the very Words that you do; and tells me that <hi>the Matter is of Divine Authority</hi> &amp;c. what shall I say to him? Shall I tell him that they subvert the Scriptures, and that there are no such Doctrines contain'd in them? Won't he retort the Answer and tell me, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is the quite contrary Way, that it is <hi>we</hi> who wrest the Scriptures to our own Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>they</hi> are sure that they are in the Right, they being infallible, which we don't pretend to be.

are in the Right and they not; You are sure of it, so are they of the contrary. You compare Scripture with Scripture, and find your System agreable to the whole Scope of the Gospel. They'll not be behind hand with you in the same Pretence. You suppose yours the most rational System<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> most worthy of God, and most agreeable to the Circumstances of fallen Man.

            <p>As for your long Discourse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about the Necessity of our subscribing our own Words; and not the Words of Scripture, I have but this short and general Answer to make. Tho' I cant possibly see into your Methods of Reasoning; nor draw your Conclusion from your Premises, yet if it be granted, that our <hi>Confessions</hi> must be in our <hi>own Words,</hi> and not in the Words of Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I don't see how it will follow, that we must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore subscribe them.

Quickning to the careless and secure, for a Help to our Devotions; and even for a public Declaration of our Religious Sentiments. And therefore until you have prov'd a necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between Composing, and <hi>Imposing</hi> or <hi>Subscribing</hi> a Confession, you say Nothing to the Purpose.</p>

<q>God alone is Lord of the Conscience; and hath left it free from the Doctrines and Commandments of Men which are in any thing contrary to His Word, or BESIDE it, in Matters of Faith or Worship. So that to believe such Doctrines, or obey such Commands out of Conscience, is to betray true Liberty of Conscience; and the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a implicite Faith, and an absolute and blind Obedience, is to destroy Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and Reason also.</q>
And I must tell you that to <hi>subscribe</hi> this Article, and <hi>impose</hi> the rest, appears to me the most gloring Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>If you reply to this, that there is no <hi>Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> design'd. I answer, what is then design'd? Is not <hi>Subscription</hi> propos'd as the Test of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy, as the Terms of Membership with the

Synod; and of Admission to the Ministry? And if this ben't <hi>Imposition</hi> with a Witness, with all the Penalties annex'd that we are capable of, I don't know what <hi>Imposition</hi> means.</p>
            <p>You indeed argue, that <hi>according to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded and common Way of Speaking, 'tis hard to say, whether Subscribers or Non-subscribers would be obliged to seperate.</hi> But pray Sir, what Occasion that either should be obliged to sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate? What Law or what Reason is there for these Injunctions, that must of course produce a Seperation? Why mayn't every one enjoy his own Opinion, and act according to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in this Matter, without a Seperation? Or why mayn't some middle Way be thought on, that will every Way answer the End pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd; and give Satisfaction to both Parties? For my own Part, I can cheerfully come into any Method for securing our Faith, that <hi>I</hi> can apprehend consistent with Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and Christian Freedom.</p>
