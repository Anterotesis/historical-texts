            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Fooliſh King graſps at wealth and power, as the ends, a wiſe King uſes them as the means of government. With the one they are gorgeous, vain appendages of royalty; with the other, they are happy inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of benevolence. A fooliſh King eyes liberty aſkaunt, and execrates it as the bane of greatneſs; a wiſe King knows that neither kingdom nor Sovereign can be great without it. The fool endeavours to root up what the patriot King moſt aſſiduouſly cultivates. A weak Prince is jealous of liberty in its loweſt branches. Hence it is, that he not only ſtrikes at the rights and privileges of his people, but is mean enough to envy the immunities of a corporation. He ſtarts at ſhadows. In ſuch
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:013981_0002_0F92597DAD78DA98"/>a reign even commercial meetings are odious, becauſe they are compoſed of freemen. Even Common-halls are an unlawful Congreſs; like that in America, they are deemed rebellious aſſociations. How ſophiſtically do mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial ſcribblers labor to draw an artful veil over ſuch political tranſgreſſions as Sovereigns without a bluſh avow? Can the ſagacious Doctor Johnſon (that miniſterial hackney) any longer rally the well grounded jealouſies of England and America? Can he now aſk theſe croakers of calamity, how ſlavery can be brought from America into England? If he dares. I refer him for his anſwer to Lord Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford (one of the ſtate nurſerymen) who ſowed a ſubtle feed or two of ſlavery, even in our metropolis the other day. I hope, however, that theſe feeds will be ſeverely choked by the rank and ſtubborn weed of liberty. A weed it is now deemed in the cabinet, and in the legiſlature, and in both condemned to be rooted up. A crop far more promiſing is expected. The experiment of raiſing it by ſlow degrees has juſt been made. His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſick of all addreſſes but thoſe of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parliament, has juſt declared, "that he will not receive, on the Throne, any addreſs remonſtrance or petition of the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the city of London, but in their corporate capacity." Thus is the notice worded by Lord Mansfield, Lord Chief Juſtice (not of the ceremonies) but of England.
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:013981_0003_0F92597E4FA6E988"/>The reaſon, or rather the deſign of this is plain. For all acts done in their corporate capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, the city of London is reſponſible as a corporation. Neither the proceedings, the reſolves, nor the Congreſs of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall, can forfeit the charter of the city; the offences (ſuch as petitions) of the city, as a corporation, may. In the one caſe they act in their political capacity, in the other they do not. The Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Liverymen, are individuals, but the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration has but one neck. This miniſterial mouſetrap is baited by a Lord Chief Juſtice of England, whoſe duty it moſt clearly is, for I will teach it him, to carry the balance with an even and an equal hand, between the juſt prerogatives of the crown, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted privileges of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I make no doubt but a Mansfield and a Thurloe will conduct the intended ſcheme as well as a Jefferies or a Sawyer. The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable caſe of the ſeven Biſhops in James the Second's time, is now forgot at court, and petitions are once more degenerated into crimes.</p>
            <p>Though the actual annihilation of the city charter may not be intended, as it cannot be the intereſt of the crown to check any ſource of wealth, yet the menaces, and intimidating proſecutions of a rapacious miniſtry, may be expected to have the ſame happy effects as threatening letters ſometimes have among
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:013981_0004_0F92597F01B79340"/>thieves. They found it ſo lately, in the caſe of the Eaſt-India Company, and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that their audacity may ſtrengthen with their hopes.</p>
            <p>Toys and baubles muſt be bought, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byhouſes muſt be crowded to amuſe and divert vacant Sovereigns, and ravens muſt have food. The numerous mouths of corruption muſt be ſtopped. Too many ſtratagems, for the ſake of wealth and arbitrary power, cannot be tried. For gold every coffer, for power every vein muſt bleed. The predictions of America, in reſpect to England herſelf, are now verifying. They are coming forward, by ſlow degrees, at this inſtant. Our miniſters of late have had a ſtrange appetite for charters. In Wilkes's caſe they had the daring impudence to attack the great charter of England for the ſake of power. They have ſince been nibbling at the Eaſt-India Company's, for the ſake of wealth and power both; the company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and acquieſced. They are ſtriking again at charters in America (as their retained and penſioned advocate Dr. Johnſon ſays) for the ſake of power, and they now have their eye upon the charters of London for a royal reaſon,— for the ſake of purſuing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intereſts of this kingdom.</p>
            <p>But are the petitions of Common-halls, or Common-halls themſelves ſo dreadful? Are the meetings, or more properly the great
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:013981_0005_0F92597FF5690110"/>Councils, of this metropolis ſo terrible? Are they not the meetings of meritorious citizens and loyal ſubjects? In both theſe capacities they have addreſſed, and in both they have offended.</p>
            <p>How harſh and grating is the voice of truth! How unhallowed are the lips that dare to utter it before the throne! Approach it, ye Britiſh ſlaves, upon the knee; adore it with proſtration, but profane it not with a petition! Upon this mercy ſeat, alas, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign will no more receive petitions from his faithful citizens and friends, from thoſe who ſupply his wants, his ſuperfluities, his extravagancies, and his plenteous coffers. Upon this ſacred ſeat he can only liſten to the ſycophantic addreſſes of a corrupt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Parliament; thoſe leeches of the realm who ſo largely drain, for their own abandoned uſes, thoſe coffers which his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed citizens ſo largely fill.</p>
            <p>How like a God does a Monarch look en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled by treacherous minions and rapacious flatterers! How like a mere mortal ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſubjects moſt affectionate and ſincere, who ſhower down at once both ſupplies and bleſſings upon a Prince whom they honor, eſteem and love!</p>
            <p>But Kings ſhould quit the tract of mortals, they ſhould diſdain the little virtues of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity! The ſpirit of a Monarch ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013981_0006_0F92598091AD5078"/>at an excentric character beyond the reach of man. This will nobly lead him not to endure, but to repel the humble ſuits of his aggrieved ſubjects; not to careſs, but to deteſt his people; not to ſooth, conciliate and appeaſe, but to menace, inſult and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate; not to human errors, but inhuman crimes; not to reformation, but to murder. Not to juſtice, but to tyranny. Not to peace and honor, but to remorſe, hatred, calamity, reſiſtance and the ſcaffold.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch Princes, like that unhappy tyrant Charles the Firſt, ſeek in vain for ſhelter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the fawning herds that idolize their vices, for the ſake of ſharing their prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and profuſion.</p>
            <p>Let them try their faithful Scots, who, as they have often received the wages of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, will a ſecond time receive the price of blood.</p>
            <p>Let them fly to the arms of thoſe tender tyrants their preceptors, who have thus care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully trained them to their ignominy and ruin from their cradle.</p>
            <p>Whilſt they repulſe a ſuffering and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured ſubject, let them fall, for conſolation, upon the friendly boſom of a Mansfield or a Bute.—Let them, in their frenzy, fly for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to their Chancellor,—not a York, alas, but an Apſley, the poor ſhadow of a Mansfield! Let them moſt deſervedly taſte all the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of deſpair and find relief (though late)
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:013981_0007_0F92598606D30648"/>at laſt, in the generous condeſcenſion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of a deſpiſed, inſulted, and oppreſſed people.</p>
            <p>Aſtoniſhed then, my Lord Mansfield, not at the humble, juſt petitions, but at the lenity of their patient ſubjects, let them deliver up their minions to the block, with ſhame and contrition reſign the crown, and ſleep ignobly with their fathers; but let their infamy be recorded, that ſucceeding Princes may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit largely from ſuch weak and guilty annals.</p>
