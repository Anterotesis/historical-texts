            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM cvii. 43.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Whoso is wise and will observe these things; even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words refer to those changes which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind experience in this state of trial; whether, as individuals or as members of society. And as God is pleased sometimes, to favor men with high prosperity, so he changeth the course of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and reduceth them to circumstances of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and distress—<hi>they are minished and brought low, thro oppression, affliction and sorrow.</hi> Those who are high and great in the world, are sometimes abased and made very contemptible. <hi>He poureth contempt upon Princes,</hi> even amongst those who had revered them as idols. <hi>Causeth them to wander in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, where there is no way.</hi> Baffles their designs by which they thought to support themselves and their own pomp and power, and turns them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, so that they know not what course to take.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:026487_0004_0FD05A276B5BE250"/>
Again, Those of low degree are advanced to places of eminence. <hi>Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him families like a flock.</hi> Thus God in his providence setteth up one and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth down another. Smiles and frowns as pleaseth him, and gives no account of his matters.</p>
            <p>When good men notice the dealings of God's providence, it will administer satisfaction to them. <hi>The righteous shall see it and rejoice.</hi> i. e. at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays of God's perfections and of his sovereign do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the children of men. Wicked men al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shall be silenced; <hi>all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</hi> These dealings of God's hands shall afford matter of conviction to vile atheists and scoffing infidels. Instead of opening their mouths to deny the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, they shall see reason to acknowledge that the Most High reigneth in the kingdoms of men, and doeth his pleasure without controul. Or, it shall tend to check the prevalence of iniquity; the judgments of heaven shall reform the wicked, and make them more submissive to the laws of heaven.</p>
            <p>These are some of the things, to which the Psalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist refers; and then intimates that those who wisely attend to the dealings of God's hand, may see great displays of his perfections, and particularly of his loving kindness.</p>
            <p>From the words we may observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is desirable and useful to understand the loving kindness of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By carefully observing the signatures of Divine Providence we may arrive at some just view of his perfections, and particularly of his loving kindness to the children of men.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:026487_0005_0FD05A29D3386CE8"/>
3. Duly to attend to the operations of God's hand, is an instance and evidence of true wisdom—<hi>whoso is wise and will observe these things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is desirable and useful to understand the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindness of the Lord. This is the result of all due inquiries into the dealings of God's hand. And this plainly intimates that it is an object worthy our attention.</p>
            <p>The phrase is often used in the bible; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times signifies a perfection of God's nature; and is the same with goodness. It is very expressive of a benevolent temper of heart; and is often attributed to the Deity. It signifies also the genuine fruits and expressions of good will. <hi>Thy loving kindness is before my eyes,</hi> says David.</p>
            <p>Now by knowing the works of God, we are led to a view of his goodness; for his tender mercies are over all his works, yea the whole earth is full of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And a good understanding in the nature and displays of divine goodness may lead us to a sense of our duty and highest interest; to be without this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to be at a distance from God, and to live as without him in the world. But a just view and sense of God's perfections and especially of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in the genuine displays of it, may lead us to repentance; excite in us feelings of gratitude and a sense of our obligations to obey God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. David oftentimes takes occasion from the loving kindness of God, to stir up himself and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to praise and bless his name. To speak of his goodness; to tell of his wonderful and gracious works; and to render to God according to his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. A grateful sense of God's kindness, implies some just view of it, and also an humbling sense of our own sinfulness, unworthiness and ill deserts. That, as sinners, we have no claim upon the loving
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026487_0006_0FD05A2A08BB0BE0"/>
kindness of God, but have reason to look for the effects of his just indignation. This will be attended with sorrow of heart for sin, and a care to turn from it unto God, and bring forth fruits meet for repentance: yielding ourselves as living sacrifices to God; improving all our talents in his service and for his glory.</p>
            <p>A proper and believing view of the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, will help us to make him our hope, our trust and confidence. This is often enjoined upon us; it is our duty, our high privilege and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and a piece of respect due from us to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Deity. In short, if we have no just view and apprehension of the perfections and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the goodness of God, we can have no proper exercises of heart towards him.</p>
            <p>But, by carefully searching out the perfections of God, as manifested in his providential dealings, which is a mirror constantly before our eyes, we may find ourselves sweetly and powerfully drawn towards God as the source of all felicity, and the fountain of all blessedness and perfection.—We therefore observe,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That in order to obtain some just knowledge of God and particularly of his loving kindness, we do well to observe the signatures of his Providence. <hi>Whoso will observe these things;</hi> i. e. such wonderful works, as he had referred to, <hi>shall understand the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindness of God.</hi> It is with this view and for this end, that we are often called upon, to look into the works of God, <abbr>viz.</abbr>—That we may be led to him. The apostle Paul observes, <hi>that the invisible things of him,</hi> i. e. God, <hi>from the creation of the world, are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. i. 26.</note> There is no
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026487_0007_0FD05A2B87B8F978"/>
part of created nature, where the voice of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may not be heard, proclaiming an infinitely wise, powerful, just and good God, who made, upholds, disposes and governs all things in righteous so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty and infinite perfection. Tho there are mysteries in the works of creation and providence, which are above our comprehension, yet what is needful for us to know, is contained in plain lessons, and, tis our fault, if we do not understand, especially the goodness and loving kindness to God. Here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We observe that God does govern the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse. He who made, has a <hi>right</hi> to order and dispose all things as pleaseth him. And creatures are as dependent for their continued support and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for their existence at first—and this contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance in being must depend upon him who made us. 'Tis a law of nature imprinted upon all creatures, to provide for their offspring. We are all the offspring of God, and he our common parent. No part of created nature is independent of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>m, or out of the reach of his governing hand. <hi>Whatsoever</hi> the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven and earth, in the seas and all deep places.<note n="*" place="bottom">Psalm cxxxv 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the providential government of God, as it res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects this world, is what most nearly concerns us, and is matter of high consolation to mankind. <hi>The Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice; let the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the isles be glad thereof.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Psalm xcvii. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But in speaking of this divine government, we may observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is of a moral nature, suited to the state of moral agents; and respects men only, so far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to this our world: Because they only are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026487_0008_0FD05A2D084EADB0"/>
of seeing into the reason and nature of things in a moral view. The laws, by which God governs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, respect their duty to him and one another. The sum of them is <hi>this,</hi> that we love God supreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and our neighbour sincerely. They are enforced by the most interesting sanctions; promises and threatnings of the greatest good; the joys of heaven and the pains of hell: The first draws by the sweet allurements of hope; the latter impels by the fear of evil. These laws are very expressive of God's authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the great governor of the world. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve further; not only does God govern mankind by known laws, but he has access to their hearts, and can move and restrain them, as pleaseth him, by some secret influence. <hi>The kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: He turneth it whithersoev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he will.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxi. 1.</note> He draws the reins of government, and keeps them from that evil to which their wicked hearts would lead them; and many times out of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular respect to his own children. God tells Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech, <hi>I withheld thee from sinning against me; therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. xx. 6.</note>. Jacob experienced the protection of heaven in this way. When he was on his way from Haram with his fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, his brother Esau, retaining a former grudge, was coming against him with an armed force to cut him off; but God was pleased effectually to turn his heart, giving him the tender feelings of a brother; so that instead of setting upon him to destroy him, <hi>he ran to meet him, and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and wept.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We observe that God expresseth his governing providence in the care he is taking of his creatures, and in ordering all their circumstances in life and in death.</p>

Revelation teaches us, what our own feelings and experience confirm, that <hi>in God we live and move and have our being.</hi> His eye is constantly upon us; his watchful providence guards us; he feeds and clothes us and carries us as in his arms; continues us in life till we have completed the number of months al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted us here; and when our days are numbered and finished, he calls us to his bar, to give account of the improvement we have made of the time and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er talents committed to us here.</p>
            <p>The circumstances of men are constantly shifting and varying. He raiseth up one and putteth down another. He poureth contempt upon princes, yet setteth <hi>be the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as individuals, so states and kingdoms are under the governing providence of God. They are formed under his inspection, and by his influence or with his sufferance; and when they are formed upon rules and maxims which approve themselves to reason and justice, God may be said, in a special sense, to be their sovereign.</p>
            <p>Every society of men is under the divine controul. We are expressly told, that the <hi>Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</hi>

                  </gap>. iv. 17.</note> This is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the case for the punishment of mankind. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar, that haughty monarch, was forced to confess, that God was able to abase those who walk in pride: That he setteth up kings and dethroneth princes at his pleasure. It is very manifest that God does raise up kingdoms and states to high degrees of earthly perfection, and then pulls them down and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026487_0010_0FD05A30C8997A20"/>
scatters the materials of which they were formed and leaves no traces of their riches and greatness. This is verified in many nations which once made a figure on the field of the world. Nothing remains, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting their names and some imperfect history of them. And, of many, once large and famous socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we believe no memorials are left. These risings and fallings of men and states and kingdoms, are so many monuments of divine sovereignty, and witness that God ordereth and disposeth all the affairs of the children of men: That all nature is in his hand, and whatever seemeth good to him that doth he, as well amongst the inhabitants of the earth as in the armies of heaven.</p>
            <p>Now the general plan of the divine government, and the particular displays of it, are matter of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and by searching into them we may acquire useful knowledge. <hi>Whoso will observe these things; shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is it to observe those things? We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 1st. It may intend, that we make a <hi>careful enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and diligent search</hi> aiming to become acquainted with the works of God: That we lay ourselves out like persons engaged and who have some sense of the usefulness and importance of this knowledge. That we pry into them, with a view to gain as just a view of them, as our capacities and the nature of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will admit. This may be expected of those, whose hearts are right with God. David observes, <hi>that the works of the Lord are great, and sought out</hi> of all <hi>them that have pleasure therein.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Psalm cxi. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We should observe <hi>these things seriously,</hi> view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as the signatures of divine providence, and with a desire to become better acquainted with the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026487_0011_0FD05A32460726E0"/>
character and perfections of God; and more suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> towards him, and better able to order our conversation in the world, as becometh the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, made by him and for him. If we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the signatures of divine providence with these views, it will tend to check all levity and vanity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We should inquire with persevering care and diligence. <hi>Then shall we know,</hi> says the prophet, if <hi>we follow on to know the Lord.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hos. vi. 3.</note> The works of the Lord are many, great and marvellous, and worthy to be made the constant continued search of all rational creatures; and to observe them with a careless in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, or give over our inquiry concerning them, shows that we have no proper reverence for God, or for the works of his hand.</p>
            <p>We cant expect to be thoroughly acquainted, at once, with any, much less with all the signatures of divine providence, which fall within our notice. Here is a field of enquiry, sufficient to employ the inquisitive mind forever. In this our world and in every part of it, God has been displaying his perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for near six thousand years. He has not been an idle spectator of the things which have come to pass. They have been under his inspection and controul; and have taken place by his influence or under his permission. We know, as yet, but little of the things which have been done under the sun; and without doubt, in the immensity of space, there have been and still are, worlds on worlds innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in which the providence of God has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly at work, and has brought to pass countless events. These will be discovered to the glorified soul, and lead it to a more clear perception of the nature and perfections of God, and supply it with increasing reasons, to admire, love and adore him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026487_0012_0FD05A340043CF60"/>
But our enquiry is now limitted to things which fall within the compass of present information. And as these are hinted to raise our minds up to God, we ought to continue in a careful and serious search, aiming to gain as clear a view as we can of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous and interesting works.</p>
            <p>Our last observation was this, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To attend duly to the operations of God's hand, is an instance and evidence of wisdom.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because it is a piece of respect due to the author of these works. Hereby we give him the honour which he deserves. We reproach the artist, if we carelessly pass by his works; the productions of his skill. Hereby we declare that no ingenuity or skill is displayed in them; or that the artist is a mean and worthless person. Thus, to overlook the works of God; or not to see and own his hand in them, is to reproach him.</p>
            <p>It also carries in it a reflection on ourselves; shows that we are not judges of true merit; cant see the beauty and excellence of God's works; or will not improve them to lead us to admire, and love and reverence him, who doeth all these things; or, that we have a perverse disposition which leads us away from God.</p>
            <p>It is a mark of wisdom to be sensible of our own defects. A wise man therefore will carefully improve the means of information; and especially those which tend most directly to lead him up to God; and give him a better acquaintance with his nature and will. 'He therefore presses forward, that he may increase in learning; may know more and know it better, more clearly and distinctly, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter how to use it.'</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:026487_0013_0FD05A36C8ACF668"/>
2. Tis a mark of wisdom, because hereby we may be led to glorify God, which is the highest end a creature can be influenced by. It also subserves our own interest, as it tends to make us wiser and better; and to bring us to a greater likeness to God. In the nature of it, 'tis a transforming know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. If we discern true beauty and excellence, it may be expected that we shall aim after it. If we do not see the works of God, or do not regard them as his, we shall not give him the glory due to his name. But, if we have a right frame of heart, the more we see of God, the more shall we love, admire and serve him. We shall the better answer the ends of our being in this world; be better fitted for the enjoyments and employments of heaven; and be raised to higher degrees of honor and happiness in the kingdom of glory above.</p>
            <p>These few observations are all that we propose under the doctrinal part of our subject. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement is now before us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From what has been said we infer, that many deserve a sharp reproof, for not duly observing the operations of God's hand. There are those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly deny God's providential government. Who say, <hi>how doth God know? can be judge thro the dark cloud? thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not. The Lord shall not see; neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.</hi> For this atheistical impiety, the psalmist sharply reproves them; <hi>understand ye</hi> brutish amongst the people; and ye fools, <hi>when will ye be wise? he that planted the ear shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall be not see?</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Psalm xciv. 7. 8. 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To suppose that any of the affairs of the world, are either above or below the notice of God is a great
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026487_0014_0FD05A3848410980"/>
reproach to him; as if he would bring a numerous family into existence, and then leave them to the events of casualty.</p>
            <p>But there are more, who, thro inattention, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the signatures of divine providence; <hi>regard not the works of the Lord nor consider the operations of his hand.</hi> These ascribe great and notable events to mere chance, which is no cause, or to human wisdom and power, vaunting like Nebuchadnezzar, when he said, <hi>is not this great Babylon which I have built for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. iv. 10.</note> For such impiety men deserve severer punishment than that haughty mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch met with, when he was driven from men and made to herd with the beasts of the field, till he was taught to acknowledge that the Most High ruleth in the kingdoms of men; and doth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth.</p>
            <p>It is a reproach to human reason as well as to the infinite Jehovah, for men, and those especially who are favored with revelation, not to be led thro se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes to the great first cause and disposer of events. But how many alas! live as without God in the world; not knowing or not considering that in God they live and move and have their beings; or not giving him the glory due to his name for his wonderful works to the children of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We infer tis matter of great rejoicing to the inhabitants of the earth that the Lord reigneth. He is qualified for it, inasmuch as he is possest of infinite perfection. He is infinite in knowledge, his eye pervades all nature. Nothing is hid from him, whose eyes are in every place beholding the evil and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026487_0015_0FD05A39C78D2AA0"/>
the good. He is also infinitely wise and knows what is best and fittest to be done: can be at no loss as to ways and means to effect every purpose. His infinite power enables him to carry into effect the counsels of his wisdom. All nations are before him, as a drop of the bucket, or the small dust of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. Whatever he pleaseth that doth he, with the greatest ease.</p>
            <p>God is also holy and righteous merciful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Natural perfections may enable a being to do great and worthy things, but do not secure him from wrong measures. He may be an object of fear, but not to be relied on. But under the direction of justice goodness and truth, he is secured from all error, whatever he does is well done; and for the best. We have reason therefore to rejoice and be exceeding glad, that the Lord reigneth, who is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tis our duty carefully to observe the works of the Lord. He is not an idle spectator of the things which take place under our observation. And if his providence regards and orders the little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of the world, then those, which are the more considerable and important occurrences are all guided and governed by his hand. This agrees with our Saviour's reasoning: And from hence he encourageth his children to put their trust in God. <hi>Not a sparrow falls to the ground without your father: Fear not ye therefore, you are of more value than many sparrows. Yea not a hair of your head falls to the</hi> ground without a providence, much less shall the head. This is the ground of that question, doth God take care for oxen? Yes surely. And from hence the apostle infers, that his care is much more particular concerning us.</p>
            <p>But if we ought carefully to observe the signature of divine Providence respecting us individually,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026487_0016_0FD05A3B462AA4D0"/>
much more ought we to notice those which respect us as a people. And on the present occasion we might with great propriety, remark some of those events which have attended the late American rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution. It will not however be expected that I should remind you very particularly, of those memorable events which took place in the late war, and led to a peace, so happily calculated to promote the true interest of this infant rising empire. In that period we should find many instances of the loving kindness of God, which ought to be kept in perpetual grateful remembrance.</p>
            <p>It was evidently the will of Heaven that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between Great-Britain and these American Colonies should be dissolved, after it had continued for more than a century and half. This connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been, for the most part to the mutual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of both countries: and until the year 1764 nothing had openly taken place leading to a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. I now refer to the memorable aera of the stamp-act. From that time these countries beheld each other with mutual jealousy. At length the British Parliament passed this resolve, <abbr>viz.</abbr>—<hi>That she had a right to make laws binding upon the colonies in all cases whatever.</hi> From that time the colonies considered themselves devoted to slavery by the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling part of the nation, and could no longer place any confidence in them. This resolve, with others of the like tenor, and a series of violent measures at length, led to open hostilities. Then the appeal was made to Heaven; and, whether we should be a free people or a body of slaves, referred to the decision of the sword.</p>
            <p>Thus, we were compelled to enter into a war with a nation, which had been a terror to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world; especially by her naval force, by
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026487_0017_0FD05A3CC8844858"/>
which she rode mistress of the seas. At the same time we were destitute of an army: Without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the sinews of war, and without military stores.</p>
            <p>But we had no alternative, excepting uncondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional submission, the essence of slavery, or a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive war. We chose the latter, humbly trusting our righteous cause to the great arbiter of disputes and disposer of events.</p>
            <p>The British nation haughtily refused every propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of accommodation short of such submission; and declared the colonies in a state of open rebellion, and strained every nerve to bring America to her feet. Congress therefore in the name of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituents renounced allegiance to the King of Great-Britain, and declared these colonies free and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent states. This resolve passed in Congress then sitting in the city of Philadelphia, on the 4th day July, A. D. 1776. The British Parliament al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways talked in the highest strain of haughty superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority: They were nevertheless, by the smiles of Heaven upon this Country, brought in the course of an eight years war, to give up the contest; and to acknowledge the thirteen United States of America, to be <hi>free, sovereign and independent states.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ought to ascribe it to the overruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, in whose hands all hearts are, that the British ministry were inclined to accede to terms of peace, greatly to our advantage. We have been told that the minister should say <q>that since Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica must be independent of Great-Britain, he would leave her under such circumstances, that she should be independent of all the world.</q> We have an extent of country superior to most kingdoms in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and sufficient to support an immense number of Inhabitants, and with all the advantages of a free fishery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:026487_0018_0FD05A3E494C43A8"/>
That this revolution, so favorable to America, should be brought about in so short a period, is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marvellous. And altho the signatures of divine providence leading to this very memorable event, are not altogether so miraculous, as those which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ancient Israelites, when they were brought out of Egypt and conducted to the promised land, yet they were as visible and as deserving of warmest gratitude. We are now at peace with all the world, excepting in some parts of our interior frontiers—It is our devout wish that a gracious and sovereign God would so influence the hearts of men, and order all concurring events, that a righteous and permanent peace may soon be established.</p>
            <p>Further. We ought to observe with sentiments of warmest gratitude, the loving kindness of the Lord, favoring us with a national constitution, so happily calculated to secure to us our invaluable civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il and sacred rights. When God had caused our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural invaders to be at peace with us, we had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear that internal jars and divisions would take place. We had no efficient government. The recommendations of Congress were readily complied with, whilst internal union and a prompt submission to order were deemed necessary for our salvation and defence. But when we had no foreign enemy to unite us amongst ourselves, we soon found that those recommendations had but small influence, unless they fell in with our particular detached inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, or local prejudices.</p>
            <p>For a season publick credit was low. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a question with the more considerate part of mankind abroad and amongst ourselves, whether there was virtue enough in the people to submit to a free, republican form of government. Such were the increasing jealousies and dissentions amongst our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026487_0019_0FD05A3FC78C4810"/>
and such the deranged state of our public affairs, that we found it necessary to have some ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in government. Accordingly the several states met in convention, by their delegates; and these, under the gracious guidance and direction of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, formed a national constitution, which has been adopted by the whole union: And, by the trial of several years, its influence is found to be safe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial. Perhaps no people since the days of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, have been favoured with a constitution better calculated to secure, to evey individual, his invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble civil and sacred rights.</p>
            <p>At present we appear to be the favorites of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, tho most unworthy. And if we are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ourselves, shall continue the happiest people on earth. The eye of God will still be upon us for good, if we fear him and keep his commandments. Well may we prize our privileges, especially at this day, when the nations of the world are in such tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult and uproar.</p>
            <p>I should tire your patience and waste my own strength, should I attempt, tho in a brief manner, to point out the state of society only in Europe for an age or two past. It is long since mankind have lost even the shadow of liberty in the eastern world; and but little more, has been enjoyed by most of the nations of Europe, now for ages.</p>
            <p>We have already observed, that a series of events had concurred to rouse America from her lethargy; and, with becoming fortitude, to assert her rights. Tho the prospect was unfavorable and the issue doubtful, yet heaven has been pleased to espouse our cause and establish our independence. The world stood by, and with anxious expectation marked eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry memorable event, as it took place, and were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonished
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026487_0020_0FD05A47478DBF10"/>
at the issue. From hence the idea of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man liberty and some views of the rights of man, have been disseminated amongst the nations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; and particularly in that nation, which lent us their friendly aid in our late struggles for liberty. In consequence of this, they have attempted to free themselves from that yoke of bondage and load of oppression, under which they have groaned for ages past. Altho their general aim has been right, yet it would be a task to vindicate all their measures; and, that particularly, of beheading their late king, Louis the XVI. America will ever remember him with grateful feelings, as her great patron and friend; and sincerely grieve for his hard fate; especially, when she considers that his friendship for her, might be the accidental occasion of those disastrous events which have befallen him.<note n="*" place="bottom">Whether the French king had forfeited his life to his subjects, is a question which does and perhaps always will, divide mankind. What the author has said in the sermon above, expresses his own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for that unhappy prince, rather than any decided opinion on the question <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> right.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The present state of that nation is very lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: They are involved in all the horrors of a civil war; attended with a war with all the nations around them. How these violent struggles will ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, God only knows, To him, as the great disposer of events, we ought devoutly to recommend the cause of liberty; beseeching him to quiet the turbulent spirits of mankind; to break the powers of oppression; and overrule the present tumults and wars in the nations of Europe, in subserviency to his own glory; the advancement of the cause and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Divine Redeemer; and the establishment of the rights of man.</p>
            <p>When we compare the present calamitous state of the French nation, with the state of America, in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026487_0021_0FD05A48C7712E90"/>
late war, we see great reason to bless God that he was pleased to order circumstances so favorably for us. That with a gentle hand he carried us thro an eight years war, to the establishment of that liberty and independence which are the wonder and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of the world: We enjoy the rights of man in high perfection. We have free liberty to worship God according to the dictates of conscience; and have our persons and properties protected by a wise, impartial and efficient government. The liberal arts and sciences have all needful encouragement. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, agriculture and manufactures, are in a pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous state. In a word, we are exalted as to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in respect to privileges. God has not dealt so favorably with any other nation as with us. And now, with great reason, he expects that we render to him according to his benefits, by being a peculiar people to him zealous of good works.</p>
            <p>But tis time we come to a close. We are now convened in the house of God, with a professed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to celebrate his praises, for his loving kindness, displayed in that series of events which have tended to bring about the American revolution and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. So far as we have been influenced hereto by the feelings of true gratitude, and a regard to the glory of God, will not fail of his gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. And tho this is the first convention of the kind in this part of the country, yet no year has passed, since the declaration of American indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, without a celebration of that memorable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in some parts of this new empire, at the annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al return of the 4th of July.</p>
            <p>But it has given pain to every serious mind, to observe that such anniversaries have been clouded by noisy disorder, riot and sinful excess. These indecencies are a reproach to men of reason; and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026487_0022_0FD05A4A4A7EB4E0"/>
especially to those who profess to believe in revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and to reverence the character of Deity.</p>
            <p>Since the speaker, by particular desire, appears as the preacher of the day, he will be allowed seriously to recommend to this assembly, that they observe that sobriety, decency and good order, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come gentlemen and especially christians. That their whole conduct be such as will bear critical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, and give no occasion to the tongue of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolence to make an invidious remark.</p>
            <p>As the celebration of this anniversary is new in this part of the country, it excites general inquiry, and will be a subject of free remark, especially with the less informed. And it may be expected that they will form their opinion concerning such anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, very much by the conduct of this conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This circumstance, I doubt not, will have due weight with all present.</p>
            <p>Let all be concerned to cultivate sentiments of warmest gratitude to the great author of all good, for those many favors, which we enjoy as individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and as members of this highly favored empire; and make it our great concern to render to God according to the benefits done unto us; hoping for his final acceptance thro Jesus Christ—AMEN.</p>

               <l>BEHOLD! the glorious day appears!—</l>
               <l>A blissful sound salutes our ears—</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>"This happy morn gave Independence birth:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Columbia, rouze! with joy supreme</l>
               <l>Dwell on the blest delightful theme.</l>
               <l>Proclaim your joy to all the wondring Earth.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>All hail! thou highly favor'd land!</l>
               <l>See freedoms blessings wide expand—</l>
               <l>See smiling plenty crown thy fertile fields:</l>
               <l>For thee shall blow the gentle gales—</l>
               <l>For thee shall swell the whitening sails—</l>
               <l>To thee old Ocean his rich treasure yields.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As Arteries and Veins convey</l>
               <l>The purple tide of life, and stray</l>
               <l>In num'rous windings thro' the human frame;</l>
               <l>So thy fair rivers prove the source</l>
               <l>Of joyous plenty thro' their course,</l>
               <l>And are the life-blood of thy wealth and fame.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Lo! meek-ey'd peace, with lenient hand,</l>
               <l>Waves o'er thy plains her olive wand,</l>
               <l>And mildly bids War's rude commotions cease:</l>
               <l>While Europe's guilt-stain'd barb'rous realms</l>
               <l>A mighty sea of blood o'erwhelms,</l>
               <l>And death's vast Empire finds a swift increase.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>May gratitude to Heav'n inspire</l>
               <l>Each heart with pure devotions fire,</l>
               <l>While Independence rises to the view;</l>
               <l>Columbia, venerate that power,</l>
               <l>Which cheer'd thee in thy darkest hour,</l>
               <l>And with thy joy thy songs of praise renew.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Behold! the glorious day appears—</l>
               <l>The Birth-day of revolving years—</l>
               <l>The day that gave to Independence birth:</l>
               <l>Columbians, rouze! with joy supreme</l>
               <l>Think o'er the blest, enchanting theme,</l>
               <l>And shout your transports thro' the listning Earth.</l>
