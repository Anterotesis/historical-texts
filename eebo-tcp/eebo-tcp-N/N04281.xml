            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Inſtance in our Text ſhows that <hi>Buſineſs,</hi>

The Apoſtles were conſtituted Fiſhers of Men, to allure and draw Souls to Chriſt, from a Pit of Sin and Miſery, to an Ocean of Piety and Pleaſure. —An high and really religious Employment! And <hi>our Lord</hi> gave them a <hi>Vacancy,</hi> with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, <hi>but tarry ye at Jeruſalem.</hi> They had been commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned long before, [<hi>Matth.</hi> x. 17 and <hi>Luke</hi> ix.] but before they were to enter upon their Enterprize, in which he ſhould be corporally abſent, they muſt have a Leiſure refreſhing Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. To what ſhould they in Reaſon have devoted this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but Faſting and Mourning, for now the Bridegroom was not always with them? Why, <hi>Obedience is better than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and to hearken, than the Fat of Rams,</hi> 1 Sam. xv. 22. He who beſt knew the Nature of Man, before he was to ſend Men upon extraordinary Buſineſs, would give them Leiſure; nor was this Space confined wholly to Devotion. Some of it, we find, was ſpent in Buſineſs or Diverſion. Certainly theſe Saints were as ſincerely and piouſly affected to God, as the ſuperſtitious Biggots to Popery can, with any Shew of Modeſty, pretend to be; yet they divert themſelves in ſo ſuitable a Seaſon, and our Lord not only appoints the Leiſure, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them in it by giving them a lucky Draught of Fiſhes. This ſacred Story leads me to think,
<list>
                  <item>I. In the general, that the common Enterprizes of Life are not inconſiſtent with Piety towards God: But that infinite Holineſs may be pleaſed with them. And in particular, that</item>
                  <item>II. Fiſhing is innocent as Buſineſs or Diverſion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Some may think it ſtrange that I give myſelf the Trouble to illuſtrate theſe Things, which, to them appear level to the loweſt Capacity.</p>
            <p>But all Men are not of the ſame Caſt or Conſtitution. A Propoſition which is eaſy and evident to one, may be as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and difficult to another; and its no uncommon Caſe, for Men who have no higher End in their Employments, and have been unſeaſonable, unguarded and irregular in their Diverſions, and have no higher End than Self, if they are convinced of their Idolatry and Carnality, to exclaim agaiſt the World! Then when they moſt of all need to be diligent in ſome good Employment, Diligence is termed Worldly-mindedneſs; ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably and temperately to recreate themſelves, is carnal
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005285_0006_1017167FDFF04500"/>Pleaſure. Theſe Difficulties require no great Depth of Tho't, nor a Multitude of Words for their Solution.</p>
            <p>We may, in an eaſy and natural Manner, conſider that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is all of a Piece, and one Duty does not deſtroy another. That Buſineſs and Diverſion, in their proper Place and Time, determined from a good Principle, and performed piouſly and prudently; are ſo far from being offenſive, that they are a neceſſary Branch of our holy Religion.</p>
            <p>Let us then in the general conſider, <hi>Whether the common En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes of human Life, be conſiſtent with practical Piety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we muſt tell what we mean, by the common Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of Life. And we renounce all unjuſt and diſhoneſt Methods of obtaining the Riches, Honours, and Pleaſures of the World: And all unlawful Games, and thoſe which are lawful, when they are unſuitably and irregularly managed.</p>
            <p>We conſider Buſineſs or Diverſions, as human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings. By Buſineſs, we mean our ſtated Exerciſes, or that which we ought to employ moſt of our Time in, and moſt of our Thoughts about. Diverſion is the turning aſide from Buſineſs, in ſome proper Period, to refreſh ourſelves, and fit us for a more chearful and lively Diſcharge of Duty. Now, if it ſhould be made evident, that theſe are Parts of our Duty to God, I ſuppoſe they muſt be conſiſtent with real Religion. And this will appear, if we conſider, That God is an active Being, and propoſes himſelf as our Pattern. It's not only contrary to Scripture, and deep thinking, but common Senſe, to ſuppoſe the great Creator and Governour of all Worlds, idle and unactive. Every one conceives ſomething of his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as the Over-ruler of human Affairs, or Author of all Things. And if God be Agent, he expects thoſe to be ſuch who are capable of acting: And as he is perfect, and muſt act in a moſt excellent Manner, according to his own Nature, he muſt expect and require his Creatures to act according to the Power with which he has endowed them. And as he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed Man with a Capacity of knowing ſomething of him, he muſt deſign his imitating of him in his Meaſure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. In this the Image of God in Man conſiſts. And we are to imitate him in Labour and Reſt, as well as in other Reſpects This will be clear to you, if you recollect the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005285_0007_101716816D074C48"/>
               <hi>Six Days</hi> ſhalt <hi>thou</hi> Labour, for in ſix— <hi>the Lord made</hi>—and <hi>reſted</hi> on the ſeventh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, no Man was made for Time, but Time for him: And as God uſes Eternity for his own Glory, according to his infinite Wiſdom and Power; ſo he expects Man ſhould ſpend his Time, according to his Capacity—</p>
            <p>Man's Capacity is the Meaſure of his Duty, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man requires Reſt and Labour, and a prudent Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and Succeſſion of each. We were not obliged to do, in our Original, thoſe Things which our Species were not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of performing: But the Limitation of Nature was a Bound by the Deity, <hi>So far ſhalt thou come, and no farther.</hi> The Stretch of a human Mind, and the Strength of Man's Body, is limited by the ſupream Diſpoſer of all Things. And the ſame <hi>Being,</hi> in limiting our Capacity, makes out our Duty, by our Make and Frame, and caſual Circumſtances in the Courſe of his divine Providence, he ſhews a wiſe Man what he ought to do, and what to avoid, and how he ſhould direct, guide, and govern himſelf or others. No mere Man ever could, nor will any Man that has the Government of himſelf, pretend to keep up an uninterrupted Series of Idleneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, of Labour or Devotion; for Experience muſt ſoon convince them that Man's Nature is formed for Variety: He is a changeable Creature, and is ſupported by Change. So Man at firſt was put into the Garden of Pleaſure, not only to ſerve his Maker, in his Devotions, and delight himſelf by his Senſations, but <hi>to dreſs it and to keep it:</hi> For in his primitive <hi>Make</hi> he needed thoſe Changes.</p>
            <p>And we need them much more in our lapſed State: As all the Works of God, in Nature and Revelation, manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare. Let thoſe who would form to their Imagination, a beautiful Deſcription of the Original of the World, read Dr. <hi>Burnet:</hi> But I muſt confine myſelf to Scripture, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Current of our Experience, in the preſent State of Things; and as to that original State of the World, you will excuſe me <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> I ſay little about it, becauſe we have little to do with it. But if we gaze upon Nature, in it's preſent Situation, we ſhall find, that every Thing calls for a prudent Alloy of Labour and Diverſion: [Tho' I muſt rejoin, becauſe I would not be wanting in Caution, by Labour, I would be underſtood to

The Reaſon of my thus ſpeaking is on the Account of the <hi>divine Diviſion. Six Days ſhall thou Labour. But on the Seventh</hi>—. God who beſt knew our Capacities, has delineated our Buſineſs [or that which we are Statedly to employ moſt of our Time in, for that I call, muſt call ſo] <hi>God</hi> confirms the Diviſion both by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and Example: And if we throw off Supperſtition and allow our ſelves to think freely we ſhall be confirmed that Buſineſs is Part of our Religion.]</p>
            <p>To return then,</p>
            <p>Let us conſider the Univerſe in its preſent State and Situation.</p>
            <p>All the heavenly Bodies keep their Courſe, [but their Orbits are more or leſs Excentric] The riſing SUN calls Man forth to his Buſineſs. The <hi>Sun</hi> withdraws, and lengthning Shades for, warn us of the riſing Damp, and unhealthy Vapour; and bid us retire for Reſt and Shelter. Yet if ſomething uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, call us longer abroad, the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> will lend a little of their <hi>barrowed</hi> Light; but amphibious Creatures, Birds and Beaſts of Prey, oft check our Improvidence or Negligence. The Sun gives us our longeſt Days when the Earth requires moſt of our Labour, and when ſhe refuſes Produce, he ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens our Hours of Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>So the vaſt Collection of Waters ſometimes heaves in its briny Billow, ſwells every Bay, and ruſhes with Joy tho' every Channel; as from an Engine played by the Almighty Arm; then ſinks into her deep Caverns, leaves Room for the Return of the rapid Rivers; with vaſt Additions from in-land Oceans.</p>
            <p>The Winds alſo take their turns for Labour and Reſt. The laborious Eaſt ſends gently in the vaſt Magazines of floating Wealth, to the favourite Sons of Fortune; while he is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the ſcattering Clouds, which he ſhoves in upon the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Land, and genreouſly pours down a more univerſal Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: and retires, when the briſk Weſt opens a Glene, ſcatters the broken Cloud, and ſweeps up the redundant Moiſture ****.</p>
            <p>So the Earth <hi>here</hi> raiſes a rocky Mountain with a frowning Front; and levels <hi>there</hi> a pleaſant Plain; <hi>here</hi> ſinks a ruſhy
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005285_0009_10171685D1E6DAF0"/>Fea, <hi>there</hi> raiſes a fertile Field: <hi>Here</hi> the ſtruggling Streams ruſh down a rapid River, <hi>there</hi> the eaſy Waters lye ſtill and move not—. But what in Nature does not? Every Thing calls for Labour, and Labour requires Reſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe uncultivated Lands call for hard Labour, but ſome other Circumſtances admit of Diverſion; for this the half tam'd <hi>Deer</hi> graze your Plains, and the rough <hi>Bear</hi> infeſt domeſtick Folds. The ingenious Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> has ſhown what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions there were at the Time of the Deluge, and how Sterile the Earth is made by that awful Event; and this to make us Labour, becauſe our ſinful Propenſity required it <note n="†" place="bottom">Speaking of the old World, he ſays that after the Fall of Man, "Theſe exuberant Productions of the Earth became a continual Decay and Snare to him, they only excited and fomented his Luſts, and miniſtred Fuel to his Vices and Luxury, and the Earth requiring little or no Tillage, there was little Occaſion for Labour, ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole Time lay upon his Hand, and gave him Lieſure to contrive; and full Swing to purſue his Follies; and the Pravity of humane Nature was — The Pravity of humane Nature is not, I fear, leſs yet then it was then— And to remove the Temptation and Cauſe of the Sin, he brought this Change, by mingling and confounding its firſt conſtituent Principles — That by this Means a great Part of their Time might be taken up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>But we are ſocial Creatures; and the Cord of Society is ſtrengthned by Induſtry. In this defective State, great Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is neceſſary in Education, in Purging out Prejudices, Infuſing Principles and Maxims of Wiſdom; and acquiring Habits of juſt Reaſoning, and prudent Determining in every Occurrence. It's needful that ſome ſhould make a Buſineſs of Teaching; and the Labour of others muſt Support ſuch in their Labour.</p>
            <p>Government is neceſſary to good Order; to ſecure our Lives, Property and Peace: And thoſe who are by divine Providence, ſet in Authority over us, ſhould be eſteemed and honoured; that they may be ſo, they ſhould be ſet above Contempt, by a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005285_0010_101716885BD2C5B0"/>generous Support from the Society whom they ſerve: which it never can do unleſs Induſtrious.</p>
            <p>Seeing we are to conſider GOD, not only as Creator of Man, but as the Founder of Society, and it muſt follow that a ſocial Homage is his Due; and this Homage muſt be paid in the beſt, the moſt regular and rational manner: It appears by the Light of Nature, and Suffrage of all Nations, that there ſhould be ſome Perſons ſtated and appointed to lead Societies in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions; to keep the Knowledge of God, and our Duty to him, clear from all Confuſions and unworthy Conceptions, and to excite religious Sentiments <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This requires the Labour and Study of ſuch Perſons, and the Labour of others to ſupport them. So that unleſs we would have Ignorance and Irreligion, and all Manner of Miſeries and Miſchiefs infeſt Mankind, we muſt labour; and as God is the Author of the Species, and Founder of our State, this Induſtry ſhould be practiſed with a View to his Glory, as Part of our holy Religion.</p>
            <p>This Thought includes Piety, Juſtice, and Charity. We muſt be diligent in ſome lawful Calling, becauſe God requires it, as mere Reaſon ſhews, ſo doth the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who will take no Method for their own Support, rob Society, or murder themſelves: If a Man provide not for himſelf, he either ſtarves or pillages his Neighbour: I can call it nothing leſs than Robbery, if he could, by any lawful Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, have ſupported himſelf; for he is as really a Villain, who, without my knowing it, picks my Pocket, as he who ſternly ſays, <hi>Stand and Deliver!</hi> And whatever I am obliged by Authority to pay towards the Support of Religion, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or the Poor, more than I ſhould or ought to have done, if my Neighbour had been induſtrious, they really rob me of; for I have ſo much leſs of Eſtate thro' their Negligence. —The Equity of that Precept is clear, <hi>He that will not work, neither let him eat.</hi> And it's as evidently juſt, he that will not labour to ſupport Government, forfeits it's Protection and Favour.</p>
            <p>The Man who will not labour, often thinks himſelf forced to lie long in his Neighbour's Debt; which is a great Piece of Injuſtice to his Neighbour and to Society: Seeing if his induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Neighbour had his Money in his Hand, he would have turn'd it to the Increaſe of his Eſtate, and Emolument of the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005285_0011_1017168C84362FA0"/>Community. It's thro' Idleneſs that Men have little to diſpoſe of, and are tempted to aſk ſuch exorbitant Prices for their Wares. <note n="*" place="bottom">There has been long and tedious Diſputes about a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of Trade, and a ſad Complaint of the conſtant Falling of Money: While the Prices of the Produce of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try are under no Regulation by Law: Every one almoſt will make it a Rule, <hi>to ſell as dear as he can:</hi> And if they aſk an <hi>Angel</hi> this Year, for that which might have been purchaſed with a <hi>Crown</hi> laſt, an Angel is worth no more now than a Crown was then; and Money muſt continue falling. It's worthy the Tho't of conſiderate Men, whether a Want of Labourers be not at the Bottom of all this. If Men don't labour, they vainly complain of hard Times, and Sarcity of Money; for they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to procure it.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Original of Communities, are Families. In theſe are weak and feeble Members, who need Labour for their Support: And that Man is not only unjuſt, but barbarous and cruel, who neglects them. <hi>He that provideth not for his own, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for thoſe of his own Houſe, hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Infidel.</hi>

               <hi>If ye ſhall fulfill the royal Law, according to the Scriptures —thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, ye ſhall do well. If a Brother or a Siſter be naked, or deſtitute of daily Food, and one of you ſay to them, Depart in Peace, be you warmed and filled, notwithſtanding you give them not of thoſe Things that are needful to the Body, What doth it?</hi> But can common Chriſtians feed their Neighbours with any thing better than fair Words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be diligent in their Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>Theſe are evident, you may ſay, but how do they reach the Rich?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rich are of the ſame Nature with the Poor, and ſtand in as near Relation to God and Society as they: And in theſe Reſpects, have as much need of Buſineſs. Tho' Men have ever ſo much Wealth, they ſhould conſider that Idleneſs and Inactivity ruſts and depraves the Mind, and renders it unfit for the Service of God or Men. It either diſtempers the Brain with Melancholly, or fills the Body with ill Humours, and the Mind with vicious Inclinations; and either of them give Satan great Advantage againſt us. Beſides— we are to conſider Wealth as a Talent given us by God to improve, therefore the more any Man has, the more he has to turn to Advantage, which muſt proportionably encreaſe Care and enlarge the Sphere of Action. He that ſinks his Eſtate thro' Indolence robs the Publick, for he cant do ſo much for the Commonwealth. And if he only keeps the Principal, and endeavours to make no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, he is an <hi>unprofitable Servant</hi> to God who intruſts him, and to the Society who protects, him.</p>
            <p>If we are to be Followers of God as dear Children; <note place="margin">Reflection.</note> if God is an Agent; if we are to imitate him in labouring ſix Parts in ſeven of our Time; if the human Conſtitution in its Original requires Change of Labour and Reſt; if this is the State of all Nature; if Piety to God, and Juſtice and Charity to Men require La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005285_0013_1017168FCA3A7438"/>and Buſineſs cannot be perform'd to Advantage without ſome ſeaſonable prudent and regular Diverſion: How wild and ſuperſtitious are thoſe who would drive Perſons into Monaſtries and Nunneries, under the Notion of their ſpending their whole Time in Devotion? And how much better is it for Perſons who are deeply in Debt, or dependent on Charity for their daily Support, to run about under the Notion of dealing with their Neigbours in ſome pretended Caſe of Conſcience, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about Things <hi>which they underſtand not;</hi> than ſtudy to be quiet and <hi>do their own Buſineſs!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Extraordinary Religion is the moſt exact Tranſcript of the communicable Attributes of God; and the neareſt Imitation of the divine Being, as far as the Dictates and Limits of our Nature, and the Rules of his holy Word. — They who are wiſe above what is written, will ſoon diſcover their Folly: For when Superſtition has overwhelmed a Man's Brain, like a Child with the Rickets, his Head grows too big for his Body, and the diſtempered Creature ſoon dwindles away to nothing. For Men in vain plead for ſuch Devotion as robs Society, ſuch as defrauds Mankind. — <hi>He that loves not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how ſhall he love God whom he hath not ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Weak Perſons are apt to ſay, Can we do too much for God? Can we ſpend too much Time in Religion? No, you cannot. But you may diſobey God, when you think you obey him: You may do what he forbids, when you think you do what he requires. You may be idolatrous, when you think you are mighty devout. Why, your Anceſtors tho't this might be; Why elſe did they reject the exorbitant Number of popiſh Faſt and Feſtivals, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> In one Century you ſeem to have forgot your Errand to <hi>America.</hi> And what do you think of thoſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who ſacrificed their Children, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Do you think that they could do too much for God? Could they do any more than to give the Firſt-born of their Bodies for the Sin of their Souls? Who could blame them, if none can do too much [in the common Senſe]? If a Man were to murder his Father or Mother, his Wife or Children, or himſelf, under the Notion of being extraordinary religious, and ſhould ſay, who can do too much for God, would you not think the poor Creature were delirious? Why, <hi>He that loves not his Brother is a Murderer!</hi> Many make a great Talk of Matters of Faith, or rather of Opinion, and will go prating from Place

II. <hi>Whether Fiſhing is lawful as Buſineſs or Diverſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not only thoſe called Religious, among the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> and the <hi>Benjans,</hi> &amp;c. have ſcrupled eating of Fleſh or Fiſh, but ſome among ourſelves, fear whether we ought to take away the Lives of Creatures for our own Support; and are poſitive that we ſhould not for Diverſion. Many have a great Averſion to thoſe whoſe Trade it is to take away the Lives of the lower Species of Creatures. A Butcher is (in their Apprehenſion) a mere Monſter, and a Fiſherman, a filthy Wretch.</p>
            <p>It's an ancient Obſervation, that <hi>a merciful Man is merciful to his Beaſt. The righteous Man regards the Life of his Beaſt,</hi> Prov. xii. 10. Where any have long uſed any Creature, the Tho't of it's Service, and ſome ſort of Regard contracted to it thereby, is not eaſily conquered. But a noble generous Soul hates Barbarity to foreign as well as domeſtick Creatures. <q>It's not certain [ſays my Lord BEACON] that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier any Soul is, the larger is it's Compaſſion. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted degenerate Minds imagine that thoſe Things belong not to them: But the Mind that looks upon itſelf as a nobler Portion of the Univerſe, is kindly affected towards inferiour Creatures—.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He that takes Pleaſure in the Pains and dying Agonies of any lower Species of Creatures, is either a ſtupid ſordid Soul, or a Murderer in Heart.—He that delighteth to ſee a Brute die, would ſoon take as great Pleaſure in the Death of a Man.</p>
            <p>But here, <hi>in Fiſhing,</hi> we are ſo far from delighting to ſee our Fellow-Creature die, that we hardly think whether they live—We have no more of a murderous Tho't in taking them, than in cutting up a Meſs a Herbage. We are taking ſomething, which God, the Creator and Proprietor of all, has given us to uſe for Food, as freely as the <hi>green Herb.</hi> Gen. ix. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>He allows the eating them, therefore the mere catching them is no Barbarity. Beſides God ſeems to have carv'd out the Globe on purpoſe for a univerſal Supply: In Seas, near Shores, are Banks and Beds made for them;—to furniſh the Lands adjacent—and Lands which lye remote, are more divided into Lakes and Ponds, Brooks and Rivers; and he has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in ſeveral Sorts of Fiſh, a ſtrong Inſtinct [or Inclination] to ſwim up theſe Rivers a vaſt Diſtance from the Sea. And
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005285_0016_101716994D9E7B10"/>is it not remarkable, that Rivers moſt incumbred with Falls, are ever more full of Fiſh than others. Why are they directed here? Why retarded by theſe difficult Paſſages? But to ſupply the Inlands? Does forming and diſpoſing of theſe Things argue nothing?</p>
            <p>Since the Flood the Earth is more barren, and Vegetables afford not a ſufficient Support for Mankind.—So that if the Lives of all theſe are of leſs Conſequence, nay, are freely given by him whoſe they are, they may be taken and uſed as Food: If they <hi>may</hi> be taken, any may make a Buſineſs of taking them for the Supply of others.</p>
            <p>But if this be innocent as Buſineſs, ſome may ſtill ſcruple it as Diverſion.</p>
            <p>And why not all Diverſion with as good Reaſon? The grave and judicious Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See his Works,</hi> Vol. 2. p. 140.</note> 
               <q>We are allowed to uſe the Creatures of God, not only for our Neceſſity, but for meet and convenient Delight. This is a confeſſed Truth. And therefore to them who ſhall condemn fit and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Recreation (as ſome of the ancient Fathers have done, by Name <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) it may be ſaid, be not too righteous, be not too wiſe, <hi>Eccl.</hi> vii. 16.</q> But if we conſider, that the End of Buſineſs and Diverſion are the ſame, we ſhall clearly conceive the Truth. The End of both are the Refreſhment and Support of Man in the Service of God. If I may eat them for Refreſhment, I may as well catch them, if this recreate and refreſh me. It's as lawful to delight the Eye, as the Palate. All Pleaſure ariſes from the Suitableneſs and Agreableneſs between the perceptive Faculties, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; that affect them: And our bountiful Maker, as he has given the animal Life many perceptive Faculties, the Senſes of Seeing, Hearing, Taſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo he has provided ſuitably Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for all theſe Faculties, and does allow us to gratify ourſelves therewith.</p>
            <p>When the Body has been long wearied with Labour, or the Mind weakned with Devotion, it's requiſite to give them Eaſe; then the uſe of innocent and moderate Pleaſures and Recreations is both uſeful and neceſſary, to Soul and Body; it enlivens Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, recruits our Spirits, and renders us more able to ſet about
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005285_0017_1017169ADEBED980"/>ſerious Buſineſs and Employment. For to intermix no Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, nor Diverſions with our more ſerious Affairs, makes the Mind unactive, dull and uſeleſs. <note n="‡" place="bottom">

Thus in the Context, the Diſciples go a fiſhing, and Chriſt maniſeſts himſelf to them.—Not only countenances them, by ſucceeding their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005285_0018_1017169F6DF5DA98"/>Deſign; but excites and draws out their Affections to him, ſo much that <hi>Simon</hi> could not wait 'till the Veſſel came to Shore, but leapt into the Lake, and ſwam ſwiſt aſhore, to greet and converſe with his deareſt Lord.</p>
            <p>—That I may not be tedious, I will only lead in your Reflections a Word or two.</p>
            <p>Religion is the higheſt Reaſon, and Chriſtianity perfectly ſuited to Man in his preſent State. And as the venerable Judge <hi>Hale</hi> ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">Contemplations, laſt Part, <hi>p.</hi> 254.</note> 
               <q>Religion is beſt in its <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> but difficult to be retain'd ſo, without Superſtitions and Acceſſions; and thoſe do commonly in Time <hi>ſtifle</hi> and <hi>cheak</hi> the <hi>Simplicity</hi> of Religion, unleſs much Care and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection be uſed: The Contemporations are ſo many and ſo cumberſome, that Religion looſeth its <hi>Nature,</hi> or is ſtrangled by them: Juſt like a Man that hath ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſimple Cordial or Spirit, and puts Muſk in it to make it ſmell ſweet, and Honey to make it taſte pleaſant, and it may be <hi>Cantharides</hi> to make it look glorious. Indeed by the Infuſions he hath given it a very fine <hi>Taſte, Smell,</hi> and <hi>Colour,</hi> but yet he hath ſo clogg'd it, and <hi>ſophiſticated</hi> it with <hi>Superaddition,</hi> that it may be he hath altered the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and deſtroy'd the Vertue oſ it.</q> Some ſo muffle up Chriſtianity, and make it look ſo melancholy, ſickly and ſowr, that inconſiderate People are apt to dread it Command, as they would the Tyranny of <hi>Sallee-Men.</hi> But</p>
            <p>What prodigious Injuſtice is hereby done to the moſt ſacred and excellent Cauſe in the World?</p>
            <p>Such zealous, weak, miſtaken Men can't eaſily be perſwaded of the Diſſimilitude there is between <hi>their</hi> Opinion and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and the Doctrine and Behaviour or <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his Apoſiles.</hi> It were worthy of their diligent Application, to make a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Attempt of running the Parralel. And they would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find their own Lives awkward and disjointed; and their Notions, in this Part, maim'd and defective, and bloated and ſwell'd in that. They would find likewiſe, that they have given themſelves and others a great deal of unneceſſary Fatigue and Perplexity: Wearying themſelves and tormenting others, by making thoſe Things Duties, which God never requir'd,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005285_0019_101716A1EA52A3F8"/>and forbidding thoſe Things which God never prohibited: Perplexing themſelves and all around them with infinite Doubts and Fears, without any Foundation: Leading Men into the moſt looſing Labyrinths, for which there can be no Clue found, by in the Traces of their own maz'd Brain.</p>
            <p>Therefore, How needful is it that we be well acquainted with the Scriptures, inform'd in the Religion of Jeſus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to the Example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? There we ſhall ſee the Nature and Deſign of Chriſtianity. —To bring <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, —Peace and Good will to Men.</hi> That God's Glory and his Good—his Duty and Intereſt— Piety and Pleaſure, can never be ſundered.</p>
            <p>He will find, that in order to an Action's being term'd really religious, the Principle from which, and the End for which it is done, is much more to be conſidered, than whether it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fall under the Denomination of Devotion, Buſineſs, or Diverſion; for they are all at one Time or other our Duty: And the doing our Duty from a good Principle and for a right End, muſt be term'd religious acting. Eating and Drinking are natural and ſenſible Actions, but when <hi>we cat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> to the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> they are to be conſidered as religious, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 31. and that not only when Men eat and drink the meaneſt for Quality, and the leaſt for Quantity that can ſupport them in the Service of God and Society but when they have a rich and plentiful Collation: A <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Says Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> 
               <q>Some Men may be ſaid never to divert themſelves, they can't <hi>turn aſide from Buſineſs,</hi> for they never do any.</q>

            <p>Should we not always in every Enterprize wiſh for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Bleſſing of Chriſt? Methinks thoſe who love and adore the bleſſed Jeſus ſhould deſire to ſee him every where, and in every Thing! who calls for our Devotion and allows our Diverſion! who procured Peace and Pleaſure for wretched ſinful Men!

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005285_0020_101716A39D23AFB0"/>This gives a Guſt to every Enjoyment, our taſting the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt in them.—We conſider him as Mediator of the Covenant of Grace, and when we ſee every Thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd from God to us by him, then we have a real Reliſh for them—. There is no ſuitable ſolid Satisfaction in any tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Good, but as the Gift of God thro' Chriſt. This every good Man, in a good Frame finds and feels—. <q>Buſineſs and Diverſions, Cities and Palaces, with their various Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments; Fields and Groves; Spring, Summer, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, with all their flowry Beauties and taſteful Bleſſings, are ſome of the Delights of the Sons of Men. Books and Learning, and polite Company, and refin'd Science, are the more elegant Joys of ingenious Spirits: Theſe are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing Gratifications of the Senſes or the Mind of Man; they are all innocent in themſelves, they may be ſanctified to divine Purpoſes, and afford double Satisfaction if God be among them: But if God be abſent, if he hide his Face or frown upon the Soul, not Palaces, nor Groves, nor Fields, nor Buſineſs, nor Diverſion, nor all the flowry or taſteful Bleſſings of Spring or Summer, nor the more refin'd Joys of Books and Learning, and elegant Company; not all the rich Proviſion of Nature and Art, can entertain or refreſh, can ſatisfy or pleaſe the Sould of a Chriſtian—when ſmitten with the Love of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, Let us ever remember that <hi>we</hi> and <hi>all we have,</hi> is God's, and that we are accountable to him for our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all, and depend on Chriſt for our Acceptance with him in all.</p>
