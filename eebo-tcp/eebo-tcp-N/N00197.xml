            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Gen. 14. 14.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>And when Abram heard that his Brother was taken captive, he armed his trained Servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them to Dan.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>OUR Father Abraham is highly commended in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for two things with respect to his Family, besides his own Faith and Piety, that the Scripture gives account of: so we have his care with respect to his Family,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To Teach them Piety.</hi> Gen. 18. 19. <hi>I know A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham there is none like him in all the earth, he will command his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his houshold in the wayes of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We have his care to instruct them in Military Discipline,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in these words, <hi>he armed his trained Servants,</hi> such as he had <hi>Trained </hi> up to be fit for such a piece of Service as God by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence called him to: His <hi>Trained</hi> or instructed Servants for such a service prepared for it by instruction or by <hi>Training,</hi> which is our u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual word for such an end. This labour and care of Abraham in this work is much commended, from his success in War, or his martial Exploit, of which we have an account in this Chapter. And that Abraham undertakes War, and successfully, and gets a Blessing by it, <hi>Melchizedech</hi>'s Blessing in his return out of the Field: we see,</p>
            <p>That the highest practice of Piety and practice of War, may agree well in one person. Religion and Arms may well be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they agree so well together, that the Lord assumes the name to himself. <hi>The Lord is a Man of War, the Lord is his name.</hi> It is the first song that ever was penned to celebrate Gods praises, in that Song <hi>God is magnified for this,</hi> as if it were one of his highest and chiefest Attributes, <hi>The Lord is a man of War:</hi> The Creation is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, and the first piece of praise given to God is, <hi>The Lord is a Man of War.</hi> Exod. 15. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I will sing to the Lord, for he hath
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000256_0004_0FA410EDB9D4D328"/>
triumphed gloriously, the horse and his Rider hath he east into the Sea, the Lord is a Man of War, the Lord is his name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Chapter we have the first mention in sacred Story of any warlike exploit; not but that there had been war before, as is implyed in the beginning of the Chapter, the Kings of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gonorrah,</hi> had served <hi>Chedarlaomer</hi> twelve years, in the thirteenth year they rebelled, in the fourteenth year, he with three other Kings makes War upon them, and he overcomes them and takes <hi>Lot</hi> Captive; and this is the first mention of any Battle fought, and as eminent an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of valour in Abraham and his Army, as is in the whole Book of God, for though Gide on and three hundred men, fought with a great Army, yet there was a great deal more Stratagem on his part: his pitchers with lamps in them, being broken in the night put a fright on the enemy; but Abraham fairly won his battel with dry blows. It is the first exploit of a Christian Souldier, the first time we read of any Christian Souldier being in arms, or of a religious Captain, with his Army of Religion and arms joyned together, this account of Abrahams arming his own Servants.</p>
            <p>In this piece of Story, four things are hinted,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Occasion of Abrahams arming his Souldiers at this time; <hi>When Abraham heard that his brother Lot was taken Captive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We have an account of the Generall of the Army in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking or War, and that is <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We have an account of his Souldiers, 1. The number of them, <hi>they were three hundred and eighteen.</hi> 2. The Quality of them they were <hi>trained men,</hi> they had their arms ready, and skill to make use of them: He presently takes Arms, he had not arms to seek, nor men to learn how to make use of them; but every thing was ready, fit to pursue and overtake the enemy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have the success of it, with the consequents thereof: the success, he recovers his Brother Lot, beats the enemy, wins a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat victory takes all the Captives. The Consequents of it were,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He gets a Blessing of <hi>Melchizedech</hi> for it. Melchizedech that was eminently a Type of Jesus Christ. God did so far own and encourage Abraham in this undertaking, that he would not let this action goe without a special Blessing, to encourage Souldiers in a lawfull War. He hath the special blessing of Christ; it is more than if an Angel had done it. Melchizedech so eminently representing
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000256_0005_0FA410EE7A510808"/>
Jesus Christ, who is a Priest for ever after the order of Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Restauration of the goods and persons to the King of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in which he shews as much of nobleness or gallantry of spirit; as in fighting with <hi>Chedarlaomer.</hi> The King of Sodom offers Abraham to take the goods, if he would restore the persons. No faith Abraham, I will not take the least from a thread to a shoe latchet, left the king of Sodom should say, he had made Abraham rich. It shews it was not for gain or advantage he had ventured his life, his spirit was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it. It was not any reward from men that he expected, but was contented with the blessing of God, that rich blessing which he got. It was a great piece of praise (but in a bad cause) of <hi>Sisera's</hi> souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that came to the waters of <hi>Tanach</hi> and fought, they took no gain of money: had it not been in a bad cause, it had been an high commendation of them, but it was in a wicked Cause, and so they lost the praise which otherwise had belonged to them. Those souldiers of Jesus Christ, that valued not their lives to the death, will shew themselves to be of the same spirit that Abram was, that will not so much look at gain, or reward of men, as the advancement of a good Cause.</p>
            <p>But to hint something to you from the words,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the occasion of Abrahams taking up arms, <hi>When Abram heard his brother Lot was taken Captive,</hi> or his Nephew, he was his brothers son, it was for the rescue of his Kinsman. To take up arms for the defence of friends and Allies is lawfull. To take up arms for such as are confederate with us, for united Colonies or Provinces from this example of Abraham and his confederate, that were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a league, offensive and defensive; So <hi>Anar, Eshcol</hi> and <hi>Mamre</hi> were confederate with him. Though here be not an expression of such a league, yet there was a great friendship and relation between him and <hi>Lot;</hi> and through Abrams wisdome, they parted lovingly, though they did part and could not live together, therefore Abram engageth in a War for the rescue of <hi>Lot</hi> and his Family.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence our late War was justifiable, though the Quarrel was firstly with our neighbours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence consequently, it is lawfull by war to defend what we have lawfully obtained and come by, as our possessions, lands and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance here, to which we have as fair a title as any ever had, since
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000256_0006_0FA410F393E86B98"/>
Israels title to Canaan. Theirs was not only a gift of Providence, but of Promise. Ours we can call only a gift of Providence but yet such as we may lawfully defend. As Jephthah said to the Children of Ammon, <hi>What <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> thy God gives thee to possess will thou not possess it?</hi> So what God hath providentially given us, without in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to others, is that which we may lawfully defend.</p>
            <p>There are commonly reckoned three causes of War,</p>
            <p n="1">1. For defence of our selves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To recover what hath been taken away.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To punish for injuries done. But to pass by the occasions of the War; through the goodness of God we have peace. Abram arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his trained servants, or Souldiers, three hundred and eighteen: the number was small to encounter with four Kings such as they were <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> being supposed to be <hi>Nimrods's</hi> successor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Tidal</hi> King of Nations, could not be a mean Prince, or have a small number of Souldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that three hundred and eighteen men must in reason be but a very small handfull or number to encounter with such an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, an Army heightned with success, flushed with victory over the five Kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, and those neibouring cities. They had a great Army for number, in probability though it be not expressed; they had an army that was heightned with success, their spirit &amp; courage was which makes men abundantly more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Take men flushed with success they will undertake any thing, though very hazardous. Here was but a little handfull to goe out against such an army. But what is it that a few men will not dare to doe, if the Cause, the Courage, the Conduct be but like that of Abram.</p>
            <p>But to note some things from the words. <hi>Abram armed his trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Servants:</hi> Abram was eminent in his place,</p>
            <p n="1">1. For preparation before War, his servants were trained men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For his carriage in the business and management of it, when he undertook it.</p>
            <p>I shall speak chiefly to the first of these.</p>
            <p>Doct. That the Training of Souldiers to be fit for War, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable practice, yea a Duty of great Consequence, or not of the lowest rank.</p>
            <p>or thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frequent Trainings for the instructing of men in military Discipline that they may be ready and expert for war, is a commendable practice,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000256_0007_0FA410F51E7B15D8"/>
yea a Duty which God expecteth of all Gods Abrahams in their respective places:</hi> that is, by Gods Abrahams in their respective places, I mean such as are meerly civil Rulers, to encourage such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises by their authority and presence, when convenient. Such as are military officers, it is their duty actually to instruct men; such may be supposed to represent Abraham, and God doth expect it from them, that they should take care of this part, which <hi>Abraham</hi> acted so happily to so good end; And which is the consequent of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Doctrine, It is the duty of those that would be accounted of Abrahams Family to learn of them, whom God requires to teach them the use of their weapons, and order of War. If it be Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams duty to teach, it is the duty of Abrahams servants, those that represent them to learn of those God sets over them, the use of their weapons, and the order of War, that they may be expert for Warr. It is a commendation of a people or of souldiers to be expert for war, that which the Scripture frequently mentioneth, I shall look but to two places, 1.<hi>Cron,</hi> 12. 33, 35, 36. in many verses of that Chapter, <hi>of Zebulun such as went forth to battle, expert for war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand that could keep rank.</hi> Here was <hi>Training</hi> up men to be expert and fit for War. And so in the following verse, <hi>of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, expert for War, twenty eight thousand, of Asher such as went forth to battle, expert in War, fourty thousand.</hi> In that Song of Solomon, <hi>Cant. 3. 7, 8. Behold his bed which is Solomons, threescore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel, they all hold swords, being expert in War. Every man hath his sword upon his thigh, because of fear in the night.</hi> It is an high Commendation of any people, when care is taken by Rulers, and people are willing to learn, and hearken to Rulers, that they may be instructed to be expert in war. It is a part of the general Calling, whereto God calls every man that is capable (not impotent men nor children) but according to that time the Scripture reckoneth, from twenty years and upward, all that were ready to go forth to war. It is not a thing by the by, but that which men should make their business. It is a duty and praise-worthy piece of skill, to be <hi>expert for war.</hi> To be good souldiers is a matter of praise or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which made the Apostle use it in a spiritual sence <hi>therefore my Son endure hardness as a good <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

they have used the sword. Of some it is said, that <hi>their hands did cleave to their swords</hi> they were so much in the use of it so happily for the advantage of the Church. The Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews Cap.</hi> 11. 33. 34. when he makes mention of the Worthyes, he mentioneth these two together, <hi>Who through Faith subdued Kingdoms, wrought righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;</hi> they two may well go together: that is reckoned one of the great works of their Faith; there is not any thing wherein the glory of the Faith of many Believers did more shine forth, then in the use of it in War. There is no higher occasion ordinary or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, wherein we have a higher opportunity or use for Faith, &amp; so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces. A Souldier may be and should be an holy man and the more fit he is for a Souldier. But that it is a duty of great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I shall speak to the Doctrine in these two parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a commendable practice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the duty of Gods Abrahams to have a care of this work to instruct souldiers that they may be fit for War:</p>
            <p n="l">I. It is a commendable practice, that may appear in four or five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that the Lord himself doth claim the honour of it: if it were not an honourable work, God would not challenge the honour of it. <hi>He teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</hi> Military skill is such a piece of divine wisdome, that the Lord will not loose the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it. If every good and perfect gift be from him, he doth chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge every good and perfect gift as from him, but peculiarly claims the honour of this gift, of giving Military skill: God is the Author of it, <hi>The Lord is a Man of War, the Lord is his Name.</hi> That the Lord doth claim the honour of it. I might shew you by induction of Particulars or by instances. Everything, every part that belongeth to a Souldier, God challengeth or claims as being from him, every thing that is honourable or praise-worthy,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The giving Spirit and Courage to men, of raising up the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men, that he claims as being from him. <hi>Fer. 51, 11. Make bright the arrows, gather the shields; the Lord hath raised up the spirits of the Kings of the Medes.</hi> He raiseth up mens spirits, when they are raised up for war; God hath a land in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God challengeth this, he teacheth to make weapons of War and the use of them. God doth not only give spirits to such a work, but teacheth the framing and making of weapons, and hath a hand in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000256_0009_0FA410F670D9E7B8"/>
the whetting and furbishing of them. He directeth the Smith to form of frame weapons for war, Isai. 54. 16, 17. to shew that he hath the ordering of the use of weapons. <hi>Behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coal in the fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work. And I have created the Waster to destroy, and no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper.</hi> God useth it as an Argument to encourage his people to trust in him, there is no weapon of War, but I do direct to the making of it. He whets the sword, and furbush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to the battel: <hi>If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on vengeance,</hi> Deut. 32. 41. He looks to the forming of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, He teacheth men the ordering of the battel: God doth give that wisdome also to the Sons of men, he teacheth them by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his own Host, the Stars: But more especially he provideth a Captain for his own Host, <hi>Josh. 5. 14. It cam to pass, when Joshua was by Jerecho, he lift up his eyes and looked, and behold there stood a mean over against him with a sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua went to him and said unto him, Art thou for us or for our adversaries? And he said nay, but as Captain of the Host of the Lord am I now come.</hi> It was an Angel appeared. When any Host of his is called forth the Lord doth take care, as he did for Israel, when he intended to possess them of Canaan he sent his Angel to goe along with them; he was invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, constantly with them; for he came to be as Captain of the Lords Hosts. And therefore that good King encourageth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>the Lord is with us to fight our Battels.</hi> He hath a hand in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the battel, 2<hi>Chron</hi> 32. 8. He appeareth eminently in the day of Battel, raising the spirits on the one side, and taking it away from the other. <hi>The Race is not to the swift, nor the Battle to the strong</hi> God over-rules it, gives it where he pleases. It is the Lord of Hosts that mustereth the Host of the Battel. <hi>Isa.</hi> 13. 4, 5. <hi>The noise of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the mountains, like as the noise of a great people, a tumultuous noise of the Kingdoms of nations gathered together: the Lord of Host mustereth the Host of the Battle, they come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the Lord, and the weapons of his indignation.</hi> And therefore we have this as a frequent expression, <hi>The Battle is the Lords,</hi> &amp; hath been used for encouragement by those that have been Commanders of the People of God, when in any eminent danger, <hi>Be not afraid, for the Battle is the Lords. 1. Sam.</hi> 17. 47. That the Battle is the Lords, appears by Gods turning the Battle by such a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000256_0010_0FA410F72AC86480"/>
small accident as he doth frequently: one stone directed right, casteth the day, as it was with the Philistines fighting against Israel. One arrow drawn at a venture smote the King of Israel between the joints of the harness, and that one stroke turns the day. God covers the head in the day of Battle, God particularly faith in every thing, He hath a hand in it, in forming weapons, giving Skill, raising the Spirit. God hath a hand in it, and eminently in this, in <hi>Covering the Head in the day of Battle.</hi> How neer doe the Bullets or instruments of death come but God covers the head in the day of Battle: Therefore it is a commendable thing to teach and instruct men to be expert for War, because God hath so great a hand in it, and doth claim the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The wisest of Rulers, and holiest of men, have been still care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full about this duty and work, in the acting of this part making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for War, in Peace, and in order to it, instructing men in the use of weapons; the holyest, and best, and wisest of men, have alwayes had a care about it. <hi>David</hi> made a Law, <hi>he commanded them to teach Israel the use of the bow.</hi> 2. Sam. 1. 18. By that weapon the Worthyes of Israel sell Saul and Jonathan. David made a Law of it, to teach the use of that particular weapon, that had been so destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the Church of God. Abraham <hi>Trains</hi> his Servants; Jacob that was so eminent for holiness, was skilfull in the use of his sword &amp; bow; he won a parcel of land by it, that he gave to Joseph, by Will at his death. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. <hi>ult</hi> and that he taught his children the use of it, is apparent by the ill use of it, made by Simeon and Levi. He had both used it himself, was expert in the use of it, had won a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portion of a country by it, and had taught it his children, It was apparent they were so ready at it. Solomon, that wise man, thought he enjoyed such peace in his dayes, that it is said, there was no adversary, nor evil occurrent, yet none made greater preparation for War then Solomon did: the Scripture speaks of it as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, to make such preparation for war: so that the holyest, and wisest of men have still had care about this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The common practice of Nations, in all ages, where the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers have been prudent, have had care of this: and the Scripture brandeth those with infamy that have failed in it. The men of Laish were secure; in the Book of Judges, the Danites had not taken up their inheritance, they sent men to Laish, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>Then the five men
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000256_0011_0FA410F828B6AB20"/>
departed, and came Laish and saw the people that were therein therein how they dwelt carelesly after the manner of the Zidonians,</hi> quiet and secure, &amp; had no business with any man, they made no provision for war, promised themselves peace: these were a people fit for destruction, it was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned their great folly and shame. That that was a means to their destruction, we may be abundantly furnished from holy Writ, as well as humane Writing with examples of the care, both of the people of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and other nations, looking carefully after this matter. <hi>The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to goe forth to War:</hi> it implyes the Children of Israel with their Rulers, had regard to this to know who were capable to go forth to War. The number of Israel was still taken from their Muster Rolls; therefore it was committed to the military Officers still to take the number of the people, Joab the General and so the inferiour officers, were sent out to take the number of the people, and they were reckoned from twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go out to War.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The irrational creatures, when sent by God in way of Judgment, act as if they were under Military Conduct, which shews that it is an advantagious thing to carry on a design. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 7. We read of the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillars &amp; the Locusts, &amp; the Canker-worm, God would send them a great Army, they should be like the noise of Chariots on the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth stubble as a strong people set in battle array, they shall run like mighty men and climb the wall like men of war, and they shall march every one on his wayes, they shall not break their Rank. God doth by it commend mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary order to rational persons, when he tells us the irrational creatures sent by him in way of Judgment, to accomplish such designs as he by his Providence intendeth, when they shall march in this manner, it doth commend to us, that Order used in War; Military Discipline is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantagious; in that God gives that instinct even to irrational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when he makes use of them that they come in such a manner.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The field or Camp hath been famous for the accomplishment of of all sorts of men; it hath ripened parts to that height, that it made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the wonders of the world in their Age.</p>
            <p>II. It is not only a commendable practice, but it is a duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Law of nature, which teacheth men self-preservation, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this as a means for that end. whatsoever is needfull for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is a duty, it requires and enjoynes whatsoever is a means for this end; so that acquaintance with or the exercise of our selves in the use
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000256_0012_0FA410F8A553FFF0"/>
of arms, or other parts of military exercise, may be enforced from that Commandment which requires men to use all means to preserve life, to defend themselves it were to no end to make a law requiring duty, if to our might we should not use the proper means for our own preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Let out a Prince never so great, tread upon a worm, and it will turn; they have that instinct in them to defend themselves. There are our Rights both as Men, and as Christians, our civil Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes as Men and our religious Liberties and Rights as Christians; both which we are to defend with the sword, as far as we are able, or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our selves to God in the way of duty in doing of it. There is such a thing as Liberty and Property given to us, both by the Laws of God &amp; Men when these are invaded, we may defend our selves. God hath not given great ones in the world that absolute power over men, to devour them at pleasure, as great Fishes do the little ones; he hath set Rulers their bounds &amp; by his Law hath determined peoples libertyes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. He that rules over men must be just that is should be so, ruling in the fear of God: therefore Kings are commanded to read the Book of the Law because it is a boundary of their authority, as well as of the peoples liberty. <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard taken away by <hi>Ahab</hi> in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as it was, was revenged by God on <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel</hi> too. If we have that that is our Right and Due, it is not anothers being stronger can make our Right Null and void: therefore that Law that gives us a Right, requires attendance on the work of this day, that is Martial exercise, in order to the defence of our selves by Arms, when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God puts us upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God by his providence keeps some Nations and people unsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, as he did with Israel of old he kept some people unsubdued on purpose to teach Israel War. So the Lord hath dealt with us by his Providence here in this wilderness, <hi>these are the Nations which the Lord left to prove Israel by,</hi> those that had not known the Wars of Canaan, only that the generations might know to teach them War. <hi>Judg.</hi> 3. 1, 2. It was the duty of Israel therefore to learn, that they might be expert for war; for God left some nations unsubdued on purpose to teach them war. So the Lord hath dealt with us, though he hath given us a good Country, yet not that full possession, but that there are some which our sad experience hath taught us, they have been left to teach us war; and therefore it is a duty to keep up such military exercises, as may make us expert for War.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our Saviour Christs Command is an Argument that it is a Duty,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000256_0013_0FA410F97070D548"/>
               <hi>he that hath not a Sword, let him sel his garment and buy one.</hi> Luk. 22. 36) which doth infer the learning, the use of it, or whatsoever is needfull to defend our selves in troublesome times. It is the duty and wisdome of any people to put themselves in such a posture as they may be fit to defend themselves: and our Saviours Command, shews also the use of a sword is as needfull as a garment he that hath not a sword, let him sel his Garment and buy one. Also when our Saviour tells us <hi>in the latter dayes there shall be Wars and Rumors of Wars,</hi> more in these dayes then at other times; it is to teach us that wisdome, that we may be found fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and prepared to act our parts in our day. Milittary Skill ought to be taught &amp; learned in the latter dayes more then at other times.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Military Strength is, under God, the appointed means, or in the ordinary way of Providence, is the proper and only means for our preservation; therefore it is a duty to encourage Souldiers. God can work miracles, but when ordinary means may be had, he will not work miracles. When Israel came out of Egypt, God did take the Battle into his own hand. So frighted as they were with Egypts following of them in a better posture for War then they, so low as their spirits were brought by hard bondage, God did miraculously fight for them, and destroy Pharaoh; but when it is otherwise with the People of God, that they have time to furnish themselves, the Lord doth direct us to use them and they are the only means of our preservation, they are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walls and bulwarks of Gods Herititage here. Gods vineyard hath no other walls, but only our Souldiery, that and our Poverty. We have no walled towns, as they have in other places, our Forts and Castles are contemptible. We have not any bank of money to hire souldiers; our strength by Sea is small, &amp; for friendship &amp; favour in the world with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that should help us is not much, or our friends lye too far off to help us in time of need; so that we have nothing left us but only this, First that hedge which God made about Job, 2. As to means it is only that wall of Bones (as one calls it) better then a wall of Stones, our Souldiers, which, howsoever it may seem weak to some, yet as when God made the fear of Jacob and his Family fall on the Nations, not one of them durst to rise up to disturb Jacob and his Family. The resolution that appear'd in Simeon and Levi, together with the fear of God, begat such an awe and dread of that little Family on the Country round about they knew they were resolute men, and would fell their lives dear; this as a means had a great influence upon all round about, that none did dare pursue Jacob; but this hath been our defence. Souldiers have been
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000256_0014_0FA410FCB4141B88"/>
the Wall, the Strength, the Glory of this little Commonwealth; the name of our military Skill, our readiness &amp; expertness in military exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, is that for which we have been samed abroad in other countryes, both among Dutch and French. What the Governour of <hi>Manadus</hi> saw in that little time when he was here, gave us no small credit in <hi>Holland.</hi> What made the Indians live quietly by us so long? they had hatred to to us many years before it broke out. What was the reason it did not break out? they saw we had skill, that Skill in Military Discipline which they understood not: that was an awe and dread to them, and is at this day, that they dare not meet us on equal terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>U S E.</hi> I. <hi>Hence it is no wayes unbecoming a Christian to learn to be a Souldier,</hi> not only a Spiritual Souldier but in the true proper sence of the letter. To be a Souldier is a Credit, a praise and a glory, to be a good Souldier; it is so not only to men but to us as Christians, to have this added to us, to be good Souldiers. It was a part of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams praise and glory, that he acted the part of a Souldier to honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, Nay it is a duty, not a piece of indifferency, but a point of Duty, a praise-worthy part, he that learns and acts his part honorably. There is such agreement between the Spiritual and temporal Warfare, that every thing belonging to a Souldier, is made use of to resemble some Grace or Duty of a Christian, something belonging to a Christian. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what is outward, but what may be made some Spiritual and good use of: As Solomon faith, <hi>I beheld the Vineyard of the Slothfull, &amp; from thence I learned Instruction.</hi> There is nothing belonging to a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier but be sure some spiritual use may be made of it, all the parts of his Armour, every one doth exceedingly well set out some Grace or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Christian. <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> there he shews how every thing belonging to a Souldier did set forth something which a good man should learn and have. All his weapons all his motions po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in War are made use of to instruct a Christian in some act of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the Church Militant is therefore compared to an Army with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for Order and for terribleness, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 4, 10. Again, John Baptist gives direction to Souldiers on their address to him to be content with their wages or hire: every one would know their duty, their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was to be content with their hire, the work was warrantable, and instruction is given for the better ordering of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>U S E</hi> II. <hi>Hence they are to blame, that either wholly neglect, or sight over this work.</hi> If this be so becoming a Christian, they are greatly to blame that do neglect it, or slight it over, do not make conscience
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000256_0015_0FA410FE46C17A18"/>
of it, in endeavouring to fit themselves, or to teach others to be expert for War: what we have suffered by it, is a sufficient Argument to press this; some have their Arms to seek, when their houses, or the Towns are beset, others are so rusty they cannot be used: these are uncomely things, the want of Arms, or the unfitness of them for the work and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice God calls to: It is a great evil to have them defective: Abrahams Souldiers were ready immediately on notice, they had not their arms to seek, Abraham was not to buy them, they were ready to pursue and follow the enemy; they were not to <hi>Train</hi> then, to learn to know their order and Rank, but were fitted and prepared being <hi>Trained</hi> before.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The highest piece of Service that ever Souldiers were employed in is yet behind; and is commonly believed not to be very far off: the highest service that ever was done for the Lord Jesus Christ is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, the destruction of <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> so the enemies of the Church are called in Scripture; whether it be Pope or Turk, or whoever else is meant, that shall oppose the advancement of the Kingdome of Christ: God doth intend his Son shall be known and proclaimed as <hi>King of Nations,</hi> as well as <hi>King of Saints, he will take to him his great power and reign, and the Kingdoms of this world shall become the Kingdoms of our Lord</hi> &amp; <hi>of his Christ</hi> the Lamb will have followers such as shall not love their lives to the death, he hath work to do in the world; and work that is even at the door is commonly believed, and therefore we should be exhorted to be the Servants waiting for our Lord. <hi>The Lord Jesus is not coming to send peace on the Earth, but the Sword;</hi> Reformation never went on yet without it; Look at it in <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> or where ever else there hath been any attempt first or last, there hath been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a War for the defence of it, or for laying the Foundation, the Sword will be drawn upon Christs account, and therefore that conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration should stir us up to keep up this military Skill or Exercises, that we may be the better fitted for it.</p>

2. Our own greatest tryals seem to me to be behind, &amp; that for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reasons. I apprehend we shall not live quiet long, or at least we have no Reason to promise our selves that we shall, on these accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are none of the Princes of note in <hi>Europe</hi> that have any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in <hi>America,</hi> but have long had their Espyals upon us, as I might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily demonstrate, but the reason of the thing it self is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this, no Merchant but observeth anothers motions and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, trading and advantage that he makes, no Husband man but hath his eye on his Neighbour, to see how he profiteth by his labour and pains, that he may do the like; So it is in other things, no Plantation goes on and thrives, but they that have neighbouring plantations are looking or it and observing it, our own dayly observation may be sufficient to make us believe this, there is not a small island in <hi>America,</hi> but the Princes or States of <hi>Europe</hi> are striving for it, as we see the other day for <hi>Tobago,</hi> St. <hi>Christophers,</hi> &amp;c. if these be looked after what can we expect?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Rome</hi> will have no peace with you, and you ought to have no peace with it, and that <hi>Rome'</hi>s Agents are abroad at work is plain, from that fire-light we have seen in the world, if the Beasts deadly wound should ever be healed, that we read of in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. we are like to feel the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, if their Councels should happen to sway the world, it is a vain thing for us to promise our selves peace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The sins of <hi>New-England</hi> increase, <hi>iniquity doth abound, and the Love of many doth wax cold,</hi> and therefore trouble will be; usually the sword is one means, by which God punisheth this sin in his people, and therefore probability yet of more of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Inhabitants of the land will not joyn or mix with us to make one Body, which is the more likely they are preserved to be thorns in our sides. When <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Sechem</hi> propounded a firm peace with Jacobs Family, they cry <hi>Let us marry together and make one nation</hi> or people: a Policy used by the <hi>French</hi> at this day, not far from us; they may think thereby to escape some scourage that hangs over them; the issue of which we must leave to God. When God intended the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites to be destroyed, he did forbid Israel to marry with them: they were to be thorns to them, and Israel was to root them out in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: therefore frequent trouble, we may probably and rationally reckon of, to meet with from the heathen. Two Nations in are the womb and will be striving. That is a second consideration, we must either learn to defend our selves, or resolve to be vassals. It is a base spirit that of Issachar, a strong Ass couching between two burdens, he saw
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000256_0017_0FA4110028FC8208"/>
that rest was good, and the land it was pleasant, and bowed his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to bear, and became a Servant to tribute. So servile are some, that they will pay tribute to heathens, rather then endure a little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. Low spirited men, let them have Issachars lot, that make his choice</p>
            <p n="3">3. The World, however pride and lust dispose them to quarrel, yet are not disposed to breed up souldiers, there is such abounding of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, or debauching that doth wound mens Consciences, and in the day of danger and trouble will fly in their faces, wounded Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences will be felt then, as it was in the case of Josephs brethren, when they were in distress, they cry, <hi>we are verily guilty concerning our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> many humane stories might be mentioned for the confirmation of this. Take one. A Captain in the Low Countryes challenged Major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>General <hi>Skippon,</hi> the Lord <hi>Veer</hi> hearing of it, told them, to morrow I intend to assault such a Town, and then I shall see who will be the best Souldier: accordingly a breach being made in the Wall, this Bravado was commanded to enter, but would not, saying, I am not fit to dye. Conscience will fly in mens faces, when they have eminent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of death: a man that did not know how to put on his Spur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, if an honest man, was wont to be accounted a fitter person to make a Souldier, then those that would cry <hi>God damn me</hi> at every word, that slight and despise Hell, and eternal Damnation. Intemperance, Luxury, filthiness, and uncleaness in the world doth so debauch men, they are not like to breed up Souldiers for Christ, to do service for Christ; <hi>he that striveth for Mastery must be temper dte in all things.</hi> I will tell you how we breed up Souldiers, both in old England and New, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Farmers Son, when he goes to the Market-Town, must have money in his purse; and when he meets with his Companions, they goe to the Tavern or Ale-house, and seldome away before Drunk, or well tipled. IT is rare to find men that we can call Drunkards, but there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Tiplers in <hi>New-England.</hi> This makes Youth effeminate and wanton, besides the injury to mens Consciences; this doth make men not so bold, <hi>The Righteous are bold as a Lion,</hi> Prov. 28. 1.</p>
            <p>It hath been a question whether Athiesme or Piety have made the better Souldiers? late experience as well as this of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> doth teach us, that a well established Conscience, is better then a seared Conscience to fill a man with Courage: some fill themselves with drink, to make them forget the fear of death, but <hi>David</hi> that was a couragious Souldier, knew no way so sit to animate his Spirit as to go to the promise of God; to encourage himself in God, fulness of Corn
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000256_0018_0FA41100E9937A78"/>
and wine cannot heighten and raise the spirits of men, so as assurance of the love of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. a well established Conscience. Faith in the promises, is above all such means as the poor simple sinfull world useth. That Atheisme cannot do so much as a good Conscience, may appear from two Reason.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because an Atheist hath no assurance of a Reward, whereas a Believer hath. That should make a Believer more couragious, because he is sure of a Reward: when a man goes to the Battle it is uncertain whether he shall out-live the Battle, and also it is uncertain whether he shall have the victory; and if either of these happen, an Atheist hath no reward, if he loose the day or loose his life: but a true Christian is assured of his Reward. He that doth what he doth, as service to God <hi>we know our labour is not in vain in the Lord;</hi> he must needs be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spirited for his work.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A true Christian is a gainer by Death; it is not so with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist, <hi>To me to dye is gain,</hi> Phil. 1 21. Therefore faith Solomon, <hi>the day of Death is better-then the day of a mans Birth,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> to the Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is an end of all mans sin and sorrow, and the beginning of his never ending Joy. He that sighteth in the Faith of this, must needs out doe one that hath no such expectation: an Atheist reckoneth of nothing in the world to come, he can believe for no reward in the world to come, that thinketh there is no God; He cannot be so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturous in looking Death in the face, as he that knows he shall be a Gainer by Death. It is Hope that animateth all our work. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that had not true peace of Conscience, <note place="margin">Non tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. &amp;c. <hi>Hor.</hi>
               </note> yet had some sence of the natural Conscience excusing, and doe express it in a strange manner. What is it such a man needs to fear? it is not all the violent storms he can be in or hazzard by them: not the cruelty of Tyrants, nor though the world should rush together. It is but an Heathen speech, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth a strange apprehension they had of the benefit of peace of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conscience: they knew not peace with God. A man that is whole and sound within, may better look Death in the Face, then any other, from any other Consideration. The Psalmist expresseth it in another manner, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1 12 7. <hi>He shall not be afraid of evil Tidings, his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To come to some <hi>Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To such as represent Abraham, Rulers in the Commonwealth, both Civil and Military; God expecteth from you that you should act Abrahams part. 1. I would speak a few words of Encouragement to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000256_0019_0FA41101A9CEF508"/>
you. 2. By way of Direction. For <hi>Encouragement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Through the goodness and favour of God, you have a people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you that have Spirit and Courage enough, that have a large share of that: a great blessing to this country; a mercy that we have all cause to bless God for: there hath rather been an excess of Courage then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or want of it; most of our losses have been occasioned meerly by it. You have men full of activity and Courage, forward enough, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing danger. You have a People bred up in this Country, that have the heart of Lions, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 8. Or Lion-like men. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2. What is said of the Horse, one may by way of similitude apply to men. <hi>He mocks at fear, he is not afraid, neither turns he back from the sword.</hi> Job. 39. 22.—25. I speak this because I have seen and heard something my self of the Courage of Souldiers, that hath been better and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing then the greatest Daintyes or Feast could be: to see the hearts of men raised in danger, rather then cast down with it. The spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men to be raised and heightned in danger, if we had the Mines of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> it would not be such a mercy and blessing to the Country as this is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They can endure hardness, that is another thing by way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Rulers, that is a great mercy. A tender, softly, effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate People is a curse and misery, when God is pleased to frame a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be such. And by the way, I might encourage Rulers, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and Parents to train &amp; bring up their Children in such manner that they may endure <hi>Hardness.</hi> Thô Isaac was a great Prince, as the king of the Philistines acknowledged him, yet when he sent away Jacob, he sent not so much as a Servant with him; he took of the stones, &amp; made a pillow of them; it was a hard pillow, had no feathers in it; but when he had the hardest nights lodging, he had the best nights rest. <hi>He saw a Vision of a Ladder reaching to heaven:</hi> it was as comfortable a night as ever Jacob had. Isaac was a Prince, acknowledged by the King of the Philistines, yet he brings up Jacob in such a manner, that he should not complain of this hardness, to be sent out alone, to lye in the woods, &amp; have nothing but a stone for his pillow, to have a piece of bread in his pocket, and water to drink he did endure without murmuring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining. It is probable his Father did not bring him up deliciously.</p>
            <p>One leaving of <hi>New-England,</hi> did commend that to Parents. You doe not know what hardness your Children may be called to.</p>
            <p>By way of Advice, two or three words.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Require of all the exercise of <hi>Trainings,</hi> or attendance upon
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000256_0020_0FA4110263F93A80"/>
them! That Rulers should look unto, that they may have Souldiers ready for any Expedition. There are good Laws, but there needs strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the execution of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Keep up martial Discipline: a Souldier is the worst of creatures that is not under Discipline, and such as are Commanders should look to that. You know the praise-worthy example of the Centurion, <hi>I say to one goe, and he goeth, and to another came, and he cometh,</hi> Mat. 8. 9. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline is the life of the work. Captains are greatly to blame, that are softly men, and do not hold their authority in the field. That which would be no fault, or might be winked at at home, should not be suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Field.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Encourage your Horse, those exercises also. Foreign Princes know they can easily over-master you in Foot, but know not how to over-master you in Horse. They that have had an asking tooth at this place, have been afraid of this; that have Foot-Souldiers enough at our backs, yet know not how to match us in Horse.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Look with a favourable aspect upon, and afford your presence as much as may be, at such Meetings as are the work of this day. Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Artilery-Trainings.</hi> 1. It is a way and means to give encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to dilligent and expert Men, by giving them titles answerable to their activity and skill. In Grammar Schools, to be a Captain for a day, makes young Schollars strive at their Books. It is a way that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth opportunity to put honour and respect upon Men of activity, as their Dilligence, Valour and activity calls for it. The Law of nature teacheth, that the virtuous Skil of any doth call for honour. 2. It is a Nursery for Officers beyond our common Trainings or a better means to accomplish those that are Officers, <hi>Artilery Meetings</hi> consisting in a great measure of such. It is also a proper means for trying the Skill of Souldiers beyond what is at other times.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A few words to inferiour Officers and Souldiers, to such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present Abrahams Servants, labour to be good Souldiers, and to that end, Fellow Souldiers, I would commend a few things, 1. Something to you as Christian Souldiers. 2. Something to you as Souldiers Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral, or men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Something as Christian-Souldiers, only these two words,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Get Armour of proof <hi>put on the whole Armour of God,</hi> that is the way to make a good Souldier, to have his compleat Armour, Armour for his inward man; without there be a Guard to that, there will be a Failing: if the Conscience be wounded, or be not safe, if the <hi>Breast-plate
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000256_0021_0FA4110354B842A0"/>
of Righteousness</hi> be not on, if men have guilty Consciences, they will find and feel the sad effects of it, when they come to be in danger, <hi>Put on your spiritual Armour,</hi> look to that <hi>Breast-plate of Righteousness.</hi> I would commend the keeping of a good Conscience: with that Bres-plate a man may look Death in the Face. When the vitals are secured, a man that hath any Courage or Spirit, will not vallue a scratch in the arm or leg. If a man have a good Brest-plate and large sufficient to defend his Vitals, it will make a man bold; he knows that ordinarily he is secured as for his life; and he that hath any spirit will venture his Limbs. Take care of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man therefore, as you would make good Souldiers. Look to your inward man, the Heart, that that be wel guarded and defended, that you have a good Brest-plate for the defence of that. Abraham first taught Piety: Engage God with you, and that would make a very coward fight. For a man to have his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science against him in the day of Battle, is a very sad thing, it frighteth a man far more than the enemy. <hi>God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, and the Philistines are upon me:</hi> That made the Philistines as bad as so many Devils to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be Temperate and endure hardness, do not live as if your great study were to please the flesh; one that is given to appetite, will never credit the profession of a Souldier nor himself.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A hint or two to you as Souldiers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be in subjection to Officers, to those God sets over you: to dispute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is unbecoming a Souldier, <hi>I am a man under Authority, and say to one goe and he goes,</hi> faith the <hi>Centurion,</hi> Luk 7. 5.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Goe to, or attend upon Trainings as those that do not reckon it a Task, but account it your Recreation, and Priviledge, as those that have a mind to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in war. The Lord Jesus when he calls out any, they shall not be bunglers, it will not be long ere the Lord Jesus will call out Souldiers, those that he will use shall be expert for War, and therefore let us accustome our selves to this work, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> fatal blow at <hi>Black-point</hi> should make men love <hi>Training;</hi> the unreadiness they were in there, they were raw &amp; undisciplined: let us labour to be expert for War; to be like our General Jesus Christ. <hi>The Lord is a man of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, look to your Arms, that becomes a Souldier to keep them fixed, and to be expert in the use of them, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 18. according to that of <hi>David, be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to teach them the use of the Bow.</hi>
