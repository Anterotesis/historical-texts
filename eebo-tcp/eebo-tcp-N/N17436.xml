            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>UNWILLING to incur the diſpleaſure of every friend to juſtice, religion, and humanity, I haſten to inform the Reader, who has caſt an eye on the Title-Page, that, in attempting to eſtabliſh the licitneſs of the SLAVE-TRADE, nothing is farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from my thoughts, than to ſet up as an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for injuſtice and oppreſſion: I am as much at enmity with both, as the moſt ſanguine advocate for African Liberty may be. I am well apprized, that acts of violence and oppreſſion, however authorized by numbers, however firmly eſtabliſhed by long uſe, and a kind of traditional attention to the ſufferings of perſons in an abject condition of life, can never change the criminality of their nature. Whatever is eſſentially incompatible with the ſacred and inalie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable rights of juſtice and humanity, can claim no place in the catalogue of virtues, even of the loweſt rank; it muſt be forever branded with every mark of infamy and guilt.</p>
            <p>FAR then from attempting the leaſt encroachment on the rights of Virtue, my ſole drift in the preſent Tract is to examine with the utmoſt impartiality, the intrinſic nature of the SLAVE-TRADE: that is, whether the Trade itſelf preſcinding from every other inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental circumſtance, which may have rendered the practice of it hateful, or even criminal, be in its own nature licit or illicit.</p>
            <p>Now, it being evident in the firſt place, that the intrinſic morality or immorality, licitneſs or illicitneſs of all human purſuits is eſſentially inherent to the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:022555_0004_0FB945B26637C488"/>purſuits themſelves, and not at all depending on our habits or ideas of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> which are but too often influenced and darkened by prejudice, intereſt, and other paſſions; and, it being equally evident on the other hand, that the declarations of the Written Word of God are ſo many ineontrovertible deciſions, by which we are to judge of the intrinſic licitneſs or illicitneſs of ſuch facts as are regiſtered in the Sacred Volumes; it follows neceſſarily, that, one of thoſe facts being undoubtedly the SLAVE-TRADE, no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can be ſo forcible and concluſive, towards evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the inherent lawfulneſs of it, as thoſe Oracular deciſions of the Word of God, which give a poſſitive ſanction to the Trade itſelf.—It is then by enforcing theſe unerring deciſions only, the ſureſt guide to direct our judgments in forming a juſt eſtimate of the merits of the preſent Controverſy, that I mean to vindicate the licitneſs of the SLAVE-TRADE; not by patronizing ſuch crying enormities and abuſes, as are ſaid to be perpetrated in this moſt ancient commercial purſuit.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the ſanction of divine authority appear evident in favour of the SLAVE-TRADE, from the teſtimonies I ſhall produce in the ſeries of my Reſearches, I ſhall conſider myſelf perfectly diſinga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the moſt diſtant obligation of anſwering ſuch objections, as are not grounded on the ſame divine authority: an authority of that irreſiſtible weight of conviction, that every perſon, who has any pretenſions to Religion, muſt immediately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to, however plauſable or ingenious the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite arguments may appear, when viewed through the ſcanty light of mere human reaſon and ſenſe.</p>
            <p>THE ſcope of the following Reſearches being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to try the merits of the preſent Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy by the Sacred Canons of the Written Word of
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:022555_0005_0FB945B5D537C728"/>God, I can expect conviction only from ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as are not ſo far deſtitute of every ſentiment of Religion and good ſenſe, as to diſbelieve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authenticity of thoſe Sacred Writings, in which the Finger of God has left in indelible characters the viſible impreſſion of his Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Now, as theſe Sacred Records contain tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relative to the SLAVE-TRADE, as practiſed in all the three religious Diſpenſations that have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the World ſince the formation of the firſt of men to the preſent time, I ſhall, accordingly, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide my Scriptural Reſearches on that Trade, into three ſeparate Parts: in which I ſhall ſucceſſively prove, that the SLAVE-TRADE is perfectly conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the principles of the Law of Nature, the Moſaic Diſpenſation, and the Chriſtian Law, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated to us in the Sacred Writings of the Word of God.</p>
            <p>I HAVE prefixed to the whole a few poſitions or <hi>Data,</hi> which I truſt, will be ſound unqueſtonably true, and exactly conformable to ſound reaſon; in order, that I may not be interrupted in the ſequel with unneceſſary repititions of general principles, nor be in the leaſt conſtrained to enter into a formal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of arguments which do not immediately affect my ſubject, and that the Reader may ſee at one view the very fundamental principles of thoſe inferences, which I draw in vindication of the SLAVE-TRADE from the Scriptural paſſages I have ſelected in the courſe of my Reſearches, out of a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſame import I could eaſily produce.</p>
            <p>THE Scriptural paſſages are literally tranſcribed from the Proteſtant Vulgar Tranſlation of the Bible; which, being the moſt generally received in theſe Kingdoms, will, of courſe, have a greater weight of authority than any other with the major part of my
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:022555_0006_0FB945B6A2531C00"/>Readers. The Edition I uſe is that which was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in London by John Bill and Chriſtopher Barker in the year 1669.</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to compoſition, I can pretend to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther elegance nor ſtyle: a Foreigner, unacquainted with the leaſt element of the Engliſh Language till the twenty-ſeventh year of his age, can have no claim to either: if he can but arrange his periods with a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree of grammatical accuracy, and expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with ſufficient clearneſs, method, and perſpicuity, he has reaſon to expect every indulgence from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive candour of an Engliſh Critic.</p>

               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Geneſis, c. 1.5.27.</note>, to the day on which He gave his Laws to the Children of Iſrael on Mount Sinai<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Exodus, c. 29. &amp;c.</note>, is generally called the period of the Law of Nature. The exact duration of this period is a matter of controvercy among the Learned. Archbiſhop Uſher, whoſe chronological accuracy in the computation of ſcriptural years is much admired, reckons 2513 years between the Creation of the World and the promulgation of the Moſaic Law. But be this as it may (for no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in computation can affect the ſubject of my preſent Reſearches), it is evident from the tenour of the Sacred Records, that, between the creation of Adam and the promulgation of the Moſaic Law, the Diſpenſation of the Law of Nature, commonly called Natural Religion, or the Religion of Nature, was the only true Religion in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">II. SIMPLE as the principles of this Religion may appear, directed chiefly to worſhip One, Supreme, Eternal, Being, the Creator and Governor of all things, and to chuſe and act in exact conformity to the inward dictates of ſound and unbiaſſed reaſon in every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of life, where Right and Wrong were leſt to the choice of man; it would be exceedingly difficult, as well as perfectly extraneous to my preſent ſubject, to digeſt thoſe principles into a regular Code of thoſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022555_0011_0FB945C1DF17F9E8"/>particular laws and duties, which conſtituted the whole ſyſtem of that Religion. I have not engaged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the whole frame and ſtructure of Natural Religion. I am to ſhew no farther, than that the principle laws of that <hi>Religion,</hi> as far as we find them delineated in the <hi>ſacred writings,</hi> not only never forbade the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> or hinted the moſt diſtant oppoſition to the proſecution of it; but that, the ſame being frequently exempliſied in the conſtant and uninterrupted practice of ſome of the moſt faithful obſervers of the laws and principles of that <hi>Religion,</hi> under the <hi>viſible protection of God,</hi> whoſe favourites they were, the laws and principles themſelves were in perfect harmony with the practice of the <hi>Slave-Trade.</hi> Two very ſingular inſtances of this kind, verified in the conduct of two of the moſt diſtinguiſhed Characters within the above period of the Law or Nature, <hi>Abrabam</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> will, I flatter myſelf, be ſufficient, without mentioning others, to juſtify my aſſertion, and ſet the preſent Controverſy in the cleareſt light of Scriptural convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <note n="(o)" place="bottom">John, 8.39.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. Now, it is very remarkable, that among the <hi>works</hi> of Abraham, the very faithful, obedient, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, juſt, diſintereſted, righteous, and virtuous Abraham, who conſtantly obeyed the voice of God, kept his charge, his commandments, his ſtatutes, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022555_0013_0FB945C4E6084460"/>his laws, and found ſuch acceptance with him, as to be admitted to the familiarity of his friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; it is very remarkable, I ſay, that there ſhould be found among his <hi>works</hi> the practice of dealing in human fleſh, the practice of purchaſing with money thoſe of his own ſpecies, and making them <hi>Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Slaves</hi>
                  <note n="(p)" place="bottom">Gen. 17, 23.27.</note>, without the leaſt intimation being ever given by any of the inſpired Writers, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in this particular, where the natural rights of juſtice and humanity are ſaid to be ſo eſſentially inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, was ever reproved, or even diſcountenanced in the moſt diſtant manner by any private or public intimation of God's diſpleaſure!</p>
               <p n="7">VII. AND what can we reaſonably conclude from this uniform ſilence of the inſpired Writers? but that the practice of purchaſing ſlaves was never accounted in the ſight of God a violation of any of the laws of the Religion of Nature. For, is it credible, or, rather is it poſſible for any one to believe, conſiſtently with the ideas we ought to entertain of the infinite holineſs of God, in whom dwelleth eſſentially the fulneſs of juſtice, that he would ſtyle himſelf <hi>The God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> in preference to any other; that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to honour him with the appellation of <hi>His Friend;</hi> that he would bleſs in his ſeed all the nations of the earth<note n="(q)" place="bottom">Gen. 22, v, 18.</note>; that he would declare he had obeyed his voice, kept his charge, his commandments, his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and his laws, without excepting any one; or that Jeſus Chriſt would have ever commended his works without any reſtriction whatever, if the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> ſo publickly and ſo conſtantly practiſed by Abraham, had been an iniquitous, unnatural purſuit, eſſentially oppoſite to the ſacred laws of Nature, to the natural rights of juſtice and humanity?</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:022555_0014_0FB945C724E63290"/>
VIII. THE force of this powerful inference, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered even as a mere negative argument in favour of the intrinſic licitneſs of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> carries ſuch an irreſiſtable weight of conviction that it amounts, in my opinion, to a poſitive approbation of it: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe impoſſible to reconcile the juſtice of God with his own ſcriptural deciſions concerning the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial impartiality, and eternal unchangeableneſs of its nature.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. THAT this poſitive approbation, this ſanction of Divine authority in favour of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> ſo viſible in the conduct of God, eye-witneſs to every tranſaction of Abraham's life, is not a bare conjecture, or a mere negative inference of a paſtionate advocate for ſlavery, but the real intent and meaning of the Written Word of God, will appear evident to the moſt zealous advocate for African Liberty, who, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting himſelf for a moment of every prejudice, that the love of humanity may have created in his mind, will diſpaſſionately examine with me the ſtriking cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the following Caſe. It is that of a BOND-SLAVE in the ſervice of Abraham; which, as related in the Sacred Writings, contains ſuch intereſting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, that, I flatter myſelf, it will evince to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> has the indiſputable ſanction of Divine Authority, even when attended with circumſtances not of the moſt pleaſing complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to the eyes of humanity.</p>
               <p n="10">X. This very deciſive fact is thus literally related in the xvith Chapter of the Book of GENESIS.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and ſhe had an hand-maid, an Egyptian, whoſe name was Hagar,</item>
                  <item>2. And Sarai ſaid unto Abram: Behold now, the Lord hath reſtrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid: it may be, that I may obtain
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022555_0015_0FB945C7DE42BC10"/>children by her: and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</item>
                  <item>3. And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her huſband Abram to be his wife.</item>
                  <item>4. And he went in unto Hagat, and ſhe conceived: and when ſhe ſaw that ſhe had conceived, her miſtreſs was deſpiſed in her eyes.</item>
                  <item>5. And Sarai ſaid unto Abram: my wrong be upon thee: I have given my maid into thy boſom; and when ſhe ſaw ſhe had conceived, I was deſpiſed in her eyes: the Lord judge between me and thee.</item>
                  <item>6. But Abram ſaid unto Sarai: behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleaſeth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, ſhe fled from her face.</item>
                  <item>7. And the Angel ſound her by a fountain of water in the wilderneſs, by the fountain in the way to Shur.</item>
                  <item>8. And he ſaid: Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence comeſt thou? and whither wilt thou go? And ſhe ſaid: I flee from the ſace of my miſtreſs Sarai.</item>
                  <item>9. And the Angel of the Lord ſaid unto her: return unto thy miſtreſs, and ſubmit thyſelf under her hands.</item>
                  <item>10. And the Angel of the Lord ſaid unto her: I will multiply thy ſeed exceedingly, that it ſhall not be numbered for multitude.</item>
                  <item>11. And the Angel of the Lord ſaid unto her: behold, thou art with child, and ſhalt bear a ſon, and ſhalt call his name Iſhmael; becauſe the Lord hath heard thy affliction.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="11">XI. Enough have we for the preſent to obſerve on this portion of Hagar's hiſtory, without proceeding to relate the treatment ſhe received in her Maſter's houſe ſome time after her return, —Here we have a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022555_0016_0FB945CC0FA54F60"/>Hand-maid, called ſoon after a <hi>Bond-woman</hi> by God himſelf<note n="(r)" place="bottom">Gen. c. 21. v. 12.</note>; born in Africa, for ſhe was an Egyptian by birth, and, conſequently, an <hi>African Slave;</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under every natural diſadvantage attending the condition of a Bond-ſlave; bought by a ſtranger, tranſported from her native country into a diſtant land, the Land of Canaan, where Abram dwelt; that is, tranſported from Africa into Aſia: ſeparated for ever from her deareſt relations, friends and acquaintance, and obliged to wait at hand, and work for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of her Maſters.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. The ſterility of her miſtreſs ſeemed rather to flatter Hagar with the proſpect of meliorating her condition, by becoming her Maſter's wife at the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of her Miſtreſs; but the event proved the contrary, and diſappointed all her hopes; for not only ſhe did not obtain her freedom by becoming his wiſe, but finding ſhe was with child by her maſter, and being, on this account, not quite ſo reſpectful to her Miſtreſs, as the latter expected in quality of Abram's principal wife, ſhe was ſo roughly handled by Sarai, with the permiſſion of Abram, that, unable to bear her treatment, ſhe fled from her houſe, left her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and took refuge in the defart. What the correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, that Sarai inflicted on Hagar, is not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſpecified in the Sacred Hiſtory: the Hebrew word uſed upon the occaſion, and rendered by the Tranſlators <hi>dealt hardly,</hi> has ſuch an extent of ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as may eaſily convey the idea of a very cruel and oppreſſive treatment, which, in the actual ſtate of Hagar's pregnancy, muſt have rendered her afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion much more intolerable and oppreſſive.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. EVERY circumſtance attending the wretched ſituation of this poor African Slave, who, though le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:022555_0017_0FB945CE56626478"/>married to her Maſter, is kept ſtill in bondage, and forced, as it were, out of his houſe and ſervice in the condition ſhe was in, through hard uſage and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, though charged with no other crime, but being not quite ſo reſpectful to her huſband's firſt wife as ſhe had been before her marriage, ſeems to excite compaſſion, and juſtify her eſcape. Were Hagar's caſe that of any African ſemale ſlave now in the Weſt-Indies, and were the ſame to be tried before a jury compoſed of ſome of the preſent advocates for African Liberty in this Iſland, one might decide almoſt to a certainty in whoſe favour the verdict would be given: the Slave would moſt probably be declared free, and both Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Miſtreſs ſeverely reprimanded, if not alſo condemned in a heavy pecuniary mulct: no other verdict would be conſiſtent with the principles they ſo publickly avow.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. BUT did Hagar obtain the ſame favourable ſentence at the impartial Tribunal of God, when ſhe pleaded her cauſe before the Miniſter of his juſtice, whom he deputed to repreſent his Perſon? Did he approve of her conduct in leaving her Maſter's houſe, and quitting his ſervice?. Did he hint the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reflection on the proceedings of Abram or her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs Sarai? Did he ſignify to her, that her quality of Abram's wiſe, or the ſeverity of Sarai's treatment, even in her actual ſtate of pregnancy, emancipated her from her bondage, reſcinded the original contract of her purchaſe, or that that contract had been illicit and contrary to his laws, or that ſhe might, on this account, conſider herſelf as no part of Abram's lawful property, but at full liberty to diſpoſe of her perſon as ſhe thought beſt?—NO:—on the contrary, her conduct was condemned by the Repreſentative of God who ordered her in his name <hi>to return to her Miſtreſs, and ſubmit herſelf under her hands;</hi> though at the ſame
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022555_0018_0FB945CF5E3F5110"/>time he aſſured her, that <hi>the Lord had heard her afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

               <list>
                  <item>13. And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very ſore: ſo that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan ſainted by reaſon of the famine.</item>
                  <item>14. And Joſeph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, for the corn which they bought; and Joſeph brought the money into Pharaoh's houſe.</item>
                  <item>15. And when the money ſailed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joſeph, and ſaid: give us bread; for why ſhould we die in thy preſence? for the money faileth.</item>
                  <item>16. And Joſeph ſaid: give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.</item>
                  <item>17. And they brought their cattle unto Joſeph: and Joſeph gave them bread in exchange for horſes, and for the flocks, and for the cattle of the herds, and for the aſſes; and he fod them with bread for all their cattle, for that year.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="24" facs="unknown:022555_0022_0FB945D7CEEA8EC8"/>
18. When that year was ended, they came unto him the ſecond year, and ſaid unto him: we will not hide it from my Lord, how that our money is ſpent; my Lord alſo hath our heards of cattle; there is not aught left in the ſight of my Lord, but our bodies and our lands.</item>
                  <item>19. Wherefore ſhall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be ſervants unto Pharaoh: and give us ſeed, that we may live and not die, that the land be not deſolate.</item>
                  <item>20. And Joſeph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh: for the Egyptians ſold every man his field; becauſe the famine prevailed over them: ſo the land became Pharaoh's.</item>
                  <item>21. And as for the people, he removed them to cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt, even unto the other end thereof.</item>
                  <item>22. Only the land of the Prieſts bought he not; for the Prieſts had a portion aſſigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh give them; wherefore they ſold not their lands.</item>
                  <item>23. Then Joſeph ſaid unto the people: behold, I have bought you this day, and your land, for Pharaoh: lo, here is ſeed for you, and ye ſhall fow the land.</item>
                  <item>24. And it ſhall come to paſs in the encreaſe, that ye ſhall give the fiſth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts ſhall be your own, for ſeed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your houſholds, and for food for your little ones.</item>
                  <item>25. And they ſaid: thou haſt ſaved our lives: let us find grace in the ſight of my Lord, and we will be Pharaoh's ſervants.</item>
                  <item>26. And Joſeph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh ſhould have the fiſth
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:022555_0023_0FB945DA73B22180"/>part; except the land of the Prieſts only, which became not Pharaoh's.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="20">XX. THE tranſactions related in this portion of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's hiſtory, afford us a conſiderable number of very pertinent reflections on the <hi>Slave-Trade:</hi> the following appear to me very remarkable.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. HERE is a whole Nation of free and independent Africans, one only deſcription of men excepted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the richeſt, the moſt populous, and the moſt civilized part of Africa, or, perhaps, of any other part of the Globe, at that period, all made <hi>Slaves</hi> in one day by a moſt explicit, deliberate, and formal contract.</item>
                  <item>2. Allowing, the Kingdom of Egypt at that time to have extended to farther than it does at preſent; that is, 600 miles from North to South, and 250 from Eaſt to Weſt, it muſt have contained, on the moſt moderate computation, as many inhabitants, at leaſt, as the Kingdom of Great-Britain does at this preſent time; Egypt was then the Emporium of the whole world, where all arts and ſciences, commerce, agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and polity flouriſhed in a degree of perfection and roſine meat, ſuperior, perhaps, to that of any part of Europe in our days. Accordingly, the number of Africans purchaſed by Joſeph in one day, at the very moderate price of one year's maintainance per head, including their land, amounted, at leaſt, to ſeven or eight millions of perſons: a number not unequal, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaps, to all the pruchaſes of the kind ever made by Engliſh Merchants ſince the commencement of the <hi>Guinea-Trade.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The happy condition of theſe Africans, prior to Joſeph's purchaſe, is a circumſtance worth obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it differed in every reſpect from that of moſt of their preſent countrymen purchaſed by our European Merchants. The latter are generally Slaves, or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:022555_0024_0FB945DB640223C0"/>in their native land; the former were all free and independent ſubjects: thoſe, when purchaſed by our African Merchants are in a ſtate of abſolute indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and poverty; whereas the latter were all people of property, and, indeed, of landed property; for it is very particularly ſpecified in the ſeriptural account, that <hi>the Egyptians ſold every man his field;</hi> that is, his landed eſtate.</item>
                  <item>4. The circumſtance of tranſporting Slaves from their native ſoil into a diſtant country, is alſo very obvious in the conduct of Joſeph, ſubſequent to the purchaſe he had made; for, <hi>as for the people,</hi> ſays the Scripture, <hi>he removed them to cities, from one end of the borders of Egypt, even unto the other end thereof;</hi> by which expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient he deprived them of every proſpect of ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enjoying their reſpective paternal Eſtates, and the places of their nativity. And, is it not more than probable, that, in the execution of ſo extenſive a plan, as removing ſo many millions of inhabitants of every age, ſex, condition, and rank, infants at the breaſt, young children, old and decripit people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and delicate, from one end of the borders of ſo extenſive a Country as Egypt, even unto the other end thereof, many muſt have inevitably periſhed in paſſing through the ſcorching ſands of a Country deſolate with famine, and parched up, as it were, by an unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted drought of ſix conſecutive years, whatever wiſe regulations me may naturally ſuppoſe were made by Joſeph to accommodate ſuch an extraordinary num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Slaves?</item>
                  <item>5. This numerous multitude of free and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Africans, become now by contract menial Slaves to Pharaoh, are immediately ſent by Joſeph to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their Maſter's Eſtates throughout all Egypt, for <hi>the land became Pharaoh's:</hi> ſo, that we may conſider them with the utmoſt propriety, as ſo many Slaves,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022555_0025_0FB945DD6BB54CF0"/>tranſported from their native place, and ſent by their Maſter, or his Steward or Overſeer, to work in his different Plantations, merely for their keep; for all the land was the property of Pharaoh, and the portion of the yearly produce of it, which they were allowed, is ſaid to have been given them only <hi>for ſeed of the field, for their food, thoſe of their houſholds, and their little ones.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. The laſt and moſt intereſting circumſtance, in my opinion, attending this ſingular tranſaction, is the manner in which Joſeph proceeded to effect his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. For, in conſequence of that prophetic ſpirit, with which the Almighty had eſpecially favoured him, and by which he foreſaw the wonderful fertility of the and for ſeven years to come, and the extreme ſterility of it for as many years after, he engroſſed all the corn that grew in Egypt during the firſt ſeven years of plenty, and laid it up againſt the time of impending famine<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Gen. c. 41, v. 47, 49, 55.56.</note>. When this began to rage in the land, he opened his ſtores, and made the Egyptians pay ready money for their corn: being entirely drained of caſh, for <hi>Joſeph gathered up all the money, that was found in the land of Egypt,</hi> he refuſed to ſupply them with broad, unleſs they gave all their cattle in exchange; which, accordingly, they did, for ſuch proportion of corn as would keep them one year: being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the laſt extremity, and entirely deſtitute of proviſions, as well as of every means of procuring them, ſave their lands and perſons, he availed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of this favourable opportunity to effect a purchaſe for which he had gradually paved the way: a bargain was accordingly concluded between him and Pharaoh's ſubjects, by which he bought all their lands and perſons for as much corn, as would keep the latter
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:022555_0026_0FB945DE6E1E80D8"/>the ſpace of one year; which, from the circumſtance of giving them ſeed, wherewith to ſow the land, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been the laſt of that ſeptennial dearth. So, that, even taking advantage of the extreme indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his fellow-creatures, when able to relieve them, in order to reduce them to the condition of Slaves, was not deemed by this righteous, and inſpired Man, <hi>with whom the Lord was,</hi> an infraction of theſe ſacred laws of Nature, which were the invariable rule of his conduct.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="21">XXI. How far Joſeph's conduct in every ſtage of this remarkable tranſaction, ſo favourable to the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> may appear equitable or otherwiſe to the preſent humane advocates for African Liberty, through the feeble light of mere human reaſon and ſenſe, I know not: this however is moſt certain, that there is not ſo much as one JOT in the Sacred Writings of the Word of God, that ſeems to diſapprove in the moſt diſtant manner, any one part of his conduct, either in this or in any other tranſaction of his long and holy life<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Gen. 50, 26.</note> On the contrary, in every place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where this eminent Perſonage is introduced, whether before or after this tranſaction, he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly repreſented as one of the moſt faithful and acceptable ſervants of God, under whoſe particular protection he lived and thrived<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Gen. 39, 21, 23.</note> by whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direction he acted<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Gen, ibid, and ce, 40, 41.</note>; and who did nothing whatever, but the Almighty <hi>made it to proſper</hi>
                  <note n="(k)" place="bottom">Gen. 39, 23.</note> The very tranſaction, we are ſpeaking of, when rehearſed by one of the inſpired Writers<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Pſ. 105, v. 16-24.</note>, a Man according to God's own heart<note n="(m)" place="bottom">1 Kings, c, 15, 3.</note>, is ſo far from
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:022555_0027_0FB945DFE92923D0"/>being taxed with the leaſt intimation of guilt in any one circumſtance attending it, that the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, without any exceptions whatever, is there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as the effect of that Divine Wiſdom, with which he was inſpired from above.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. A FURTHER ſcriptural evidence, that the conduct of Joſeph in purchaſing ſo many millions of his fellow-creatures, and reducing them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Slaves, met the intire approbation of God, and was therefore perfectly conſonant to the ſacred laws of Nature, is that remarkable declaration of the Word of God, regiſtered in the Firſt book of CHRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NICLES, c. 5. v. 1—3, which aſſigns the true reaſon for transfering the right of Primogeniture, or Firſt-born, from the Family of Reuben; eldeſt ſon of Jacob, to the Family of Joſeph; which, as it is expreſsly mentioned in that place, was Reuben's inceſtuous converſation with Bilhah, his Father's concubine<note n="(n)" place="bottom">Gen. 35, 22.</note>—But is it credible, conſiſtently with the eſſential juſtice of God, that he ſhould deprive Reuben's children of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeniture or birth-right, for having once transgreſſed one of the Laws of Nature, and yet ſhould at the ſame time, even in preſerence to Judah the Meſſiah's pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>genitor, give it to thoſe of Joſeph, who, by the very act of enſlaving ſo many millions of his fellow-creatures, and uſing them as he did, muſt have neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the horrid guilt of reiterated tranſgreſſions of ſeveral of thoſe ſacred Laws, if, what is ſo confidently aſſerted be true, that the SLAVE-TRADE, or the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of Slaves, is an iniquitous unnatural purſuit, and a crime of the blackeſt die, in direct oppoſition to every principle of Nature? How could any one in ſuch chimerical ſuppoſition reconcile the viſible par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:022555_0028_0FB945E188CB24F8"/>of God's conduct with his own Scriptural decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the eternal and immutable rectitude of his juſtice?</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. ONE evidence more, drawn from the ſame ſcriptural ſource of conviction, will, I hope, be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to evince the irreproachableneſs of Joſeph's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in the tranſaction now before us. Every body knows, who knows any thing of Scripture, that the ſpeeches made to their Children by the holy Patriarchs of old, prior to their departure from this world, called in the language of Scripture <hi>Bleſſing the Children</hi>
                  <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Gen. 27, v. 4, 7, 10, 12, 19. &amp;c.</note>, were ſo many prophetic declarations of the Word of God, predicting to them the future events that ſhould diſtinguiſh them and their families, and entailing upon them and their poſterity that portion of happineſs or miſery, to which their moral or immoral conduct en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled them. This being an undoubted truth, lot us now examine with an attentive eye ſome of the moſt material circumſtances of that ſolemn Bleſſing, which Jacob beſtowed on Joſeph and his Brethren a little before his death<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Gen. 49. V. 1, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. This Bleſſing was beſtowed on Joſeph and his Brethren about ten years after Joſeph had enſlaved all the inhabitants of Egypt, excepting theſe of the Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal Order<note n="(q)" place="bottom">Gen. 47.28.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Jacob in this Bleſſing reproaches Reuben, his eldeſt ſon, with the infamy of his inceſtuous crime in the ſtrongeſt terms; and declares, that, in puniſhment of it, <hi>be ſhould not excel,</hi> but ſhould be as <hi>unſtable as water.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. Simeon and Levi are branded by the holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch with being <hi>Inſtruments of cruelty;</hi> he abhors their counſels; calls their company diſhonourable;

                     <note n="(r)" place="bottom">Gen. 34, v. 25, 26.</note>; and, as a puniſhment of their barbarous cruelty, he declares they ſhould be divided and ſcattered in the land of Promiſe.</item>
                  <item>4. When the Holy Patriarch comes to bleſs his ſon Joſeph, he expreſſes himſelf in the following empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and divine ſtrain. <q>
                        <hi>Joſeph is a fruitful bough: even a fruitful bough by a well, whoſe branches run over the wall. The archers have ſorely grieved him, and ſhot at him, and bated him: but his how whode in ſtrength, and the arms of his hands were made ſtrong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob: from thence is the Shepherd, the ſtone of Iſrael; even by the God of thy father, who ſhall help thee, and by the Almighty, who ſhall bleſs thee with bleſſings of heaven above, bleſſings of the deep that lieth under, bleſſings of the breaſt, and of the wob. The bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of thy father have prevailed above the bleſſings of my progenitors: unto the utmoſt bounds of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting hills, they ſhall he on the head of Joſeph, and on the crown of the head of him, that was ſeparate from his brethren</hi>
                        <note n="(s)" place="bottom">Gen. 49, v. 22-25.</note>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>IN theſe prophetic and beautiful expreſſions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting in the moſt pleaſing colours the perſonal character of Joſeph, and the bleſſings entailed on his poſterity, literally fulfilled after wards, we can perceive nothing but what neceſſarily ſuppoſes in Joſeph the greateſt innocence of heart, the moſt unimpeachable rectitude of conduct, and the moſt gracious accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with his Creator. No part of his conduct is here
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:022555_0030_0FB945E9B06461C8"/>branded with diſgrace, with the leaſt appearance of the ſmalleſt guilt, or with the moſt diſtant intimation of reproof.</p>
               <p>BUT, were the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> as criminal in its nature as it is pretended, were it a purſuit hateful in the ſight of God, and an attrocious encroachment on the ſacred rights of juſtice and humanity, would Jacob, or, rather, would God, who ſpoke by his mouth, have over looked the attrocity of a crime big with ſuch an accumulation of guilt? Would he have engaged his word to be his help and protection, and to beſtow ſuch a plenitude of bleſſings on the crown of his head, as ſoon almoſt as he had concluded that Slave-contract we are ſpeaking of, and at the very time he was keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in bondage ſo many millions of his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Would God, I ſay, or could God, without a moſt glaring oppoſition to the eſſential rights of his own juſtice, have acted thus in the caſe of Joſeph, and at the ſame time rebuke his brethren, Reuben, Sime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Levy, in the ſevereſt terms, and inflict a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment on them and their poſterity (though the former had only one accuſation againſt him, and the two latter pleaded in juſtification of their violent proceedings the revenge due to their ſiſter Dinah, and the honor of their Father's houſe<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Gen. 34. v. 7, 30, 31.</note>), had not Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph's recent conduct in reducing ſo many millions of free Africans to the abject condition of Slaves, as well as every other tranſaction of his life, been perfectly agreeable to the invariable tenor of thoſe ſacred Laws, of which he alone was the Author and Judge?</p>
               <p>To every one of theſe queſtions there is but one direct anſwer; which, as it muſt neceſſarily be in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, muſt, of conſequence evince to the meaneſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022555_0031_0FB945EB382AD090"/>capacity, that the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> has the indiſputable ſanction of God in its ſupport.</p>
               <p n="24">XXIV. I WILL not conceal, or even diſguiſe, in favour of the cauſe I have eſpouſed, what, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, will be objected to the argument I have juſt enforced, from the Scriptural account of Joſeph's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive purchaſe of African Slaves.—It will be objected, I preſume, that Joſeph purchaſe was not a forcible purchaſe; that the Egyptians, whom he bought, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves of their own accord, and deſired that he would buy them at a certain price<note n="(v)" place="bottom">Gen. 47. v. 19.</note>; and that, of courſe, the free and voluntary ceſſion they made of their liberties and perſons juſtified Joſeph's conduct, and rendered his contract juſt and valid, without injuring the natural rights of juſtice and humanity; which being far otherwiſe in the uſual practice of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> in which perſons are ſold and bought without their conſent, the inferences drawn in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that Trade from the practice of Joſeph, can have no weight of conviction in ſupport of the <hi>Slave-Trade.</hi>—No one, I truſt, will tax me with partiality to my cauſe from the ſtatement of this argument againſt myſelf: I have given it, I think, all the weight it is able to carry: how much it will weigh in the ſcale of ſound and unprejudiced reaſon, will ſoon appear from the following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. 1. I can by no means allow, that Joſeph's purchaſe of Pharaoh's ſubjects was not a forcible pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe in fact, and in ſtrictneſs of language. It is true, the Egyptians themſelves, without any apparent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit propoſal on the part of Joſeph, deſired him to buy them for bread: but did they ever think of making that offer, whilſt they had any bread to eat, or any
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022555_0032_0FB945ED36DAC538"/>means left for buying or procuring it? Did not Joſeph himſelf, prior to that offer, pave, as it were, the way to it, by engroſſing all the corn in the land of Egypt, and by ſelling it to them for money and cattle, till they had neither money nor cattle to give in exchange? —Let us hear how they addreſs themſelves to him their petition will beſt explain, how far their offer may be called voluntary on their part. <q>
                     <hi>They came unto him the ſecond year,</hi> ſays the ſacred Writer, <hi>and ſaid unto him: We will not hide it from my Lord, how that our money is ſpent; my Lord alſo hath our herds of cattle: there is not aught left in the ſight of my Lord, but our bodies and our lands.</hi> Wherefore ſhall we die <hi>before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be ſervants unto Pharaoh; and give us ſeed, that</hi> we may live and not die, <hi>that the land be not deſolate.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Is this the language of perſons, who freely, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, of their own accord, and without any compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whatever, offer themſelves to ſale? Is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the very words of their own addreſs, that, finding themſelves reduced to the laſt extremity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence, and ſeeing nothing before their eyes but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable death or ſlavery, they were forced, through dread of the former, to ſubmit to the latter? And can there be a more forcible contract, than that which is made only through fear of death, only to avoid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable death?—The ceſſion then made by the Egyptians of their liberties and perſons, was neither in fact, nor in ſtrictneſs of language, nor, indeed, in conformity with the Scriptural account of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending it, a free and voluntary ceſſion. Had not therefore Joſeph had better grounds in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his Natural Religion, of which he was a moſt ſtrict obſerver, to aſſure himſelf of the juſtice of his
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022555_0033_0FB945EE435030B8"/>contract, the ceſſion of the Egyptians, forcible in the ſtricteſt propriety of the word, would never have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Contract juſt and valid in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But even granting, for a moment, that the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians did really make a free and voluntary ceſſion of their liberties and perſons; I do not ſee, upon what principle of reaſon their ceſſion could juſtify Joſeph's conduct and make his purchaſe lawful, if, as it is ſo confidently aſſerted, the <hi>Slave Trade</hi> be eſſentially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt and illicit in its own nature. For, if to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe thoſe of our own ſpecies be highly criminal in itſelf, be an unjuſt invaſion on the rights of <hi>juſtice</hi> and humanity, and directly oppoſite to the Sacred Laws of Nature, how is it poſſible to conceive, that any ceſſion whatever of the party to be purchaſed ſhould make that <hi>juſt</hi> and lawful in the ſight of God, which by his unalterable eternal laws is eſſentially the very reverſe? Can human agreements diſpenſe in the laws of God? Whatever is eſſentially <hi>unjuſt</hi> and illicit to purchaſe, muſt be as eſſentially <hi>unjuſt</hi> and illicit to ſell.—The <hi>objection</hi> then grounded on the pretended voluntary ceſſion of the Egyptians, however plauſible it may appear at firſt, is utterly inconcluſive and ill founded.</p>

            <p n="1">1. THE Moſaic Law, called alſo the Written Law, and the Moſaic Diſpenſation, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Diſpenſation of the Law of Nature: not, as if, by the publication of the former<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Exod. c. 29, &amp;c.</note>, the latter had been totally abrogated, or ſuffered the leaſt relaxation in any of its laws, which are of perpetual obligation; but becauſe the Almighty willing to eſtabliſh a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with his Choſen People, the Children of Iſrael, added to the former obligations ſuch other ſtatutes, Laws, and ceremonies, as were to diſtinguiſh them from every other Nation in the world. This Law is very frequently called, even in Scripture, the Law of Moſes<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Joſh. c. 8, v. 31, 32. Ibid. 23, 6. I. Kings, 2, 3. II. Kings, 23, 25.</note> and Moſes is ſaid to have been the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver or the Legiſlator of the Children of Iſrael; not becauſe it was framed by him, but becauſe the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty delivered it to them through his miniſtry, and he committed it to writing. How long this Law was in force from the firſt promulgation of it, has been the <hi>ſubject</hi> of much inquiry among the Learned: but, without entering now into a critical diſcuſſion of this controverted point, we may ſafely venture to fix that period, without either advantage or <hi>prejudice</hi> to the <hi>Subject</hi> of our Reſearches, to the time of the Apoſtles Council held at Jeruſalem, in which the Law of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and other Legal obſervances were, by an
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:022555_0036_0FB945F76A00CEC0"/>expreſs Decree of that Council, declared unneceſſary to Salvation, and conſequently of no further obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Acts 15, 1, &amp;c.</note> This Council, according to the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Archbiſhop Uſher, was held in the Year of the World 4055; and as the Law was promulged in the Year 2513, according to the chronological computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame Author; it follows, that the Law of Moſes, or the Moſaic Diſpenſation, continued in force 1542 Years.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Now, before, I proceed to ſhew, that the Laws and Principles of this ſecond Divine Diſpenſation of Religion, not only never prohibited the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> but gave, on the contrary, a poſitive ſanction to the proſecution of it; I judge neceſſary to apprize the Reader, that the arguments I mean to enforce in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> as confined to this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond period of true Religion, ſhall be entirely ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch written laws and principles of internal moral rectitude, as conſtituted the true morality of that Religion; and not on ſuch Legal obſervances and practices, as were peculiar to it, and conſtituted only the ritual, typical, or ceremonial part of its frame. The following deciſive inſtances of the former ſort, will, without producing others, be ſufficient, I hope, to eſtabliſh my aſſertion, beyond the power of reply.</p>

               <p n="4">IV. HERE, it is evident in the firſt place, that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever limited the time was of the Slavery of an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, he was yet in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word a true and real Slave for the time; for he was his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's property, bought for a certain price; and his Maſter, on this account, had an undoubted right and power to ſell him again to another perſon before the expiration of that time. But, were the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> or the purchaſing of thoſe of our own ſpecies, and dealing in human fleſh, a purſuit of that heinous and crying nature, as to be eſſentially unlawful, eſſentially incompatible with the principles of reaſon, nature, and true Religion, would God, Juſtice and Sanctity itſelf, have authoriſed the practice of it with ſo poſitive, ſo manifeſt, ſo explicit a ſanction, I do not ſay for the ſpace of ſix years, but even for a ſingle moment, at the very time he was making his Holy Covenant with his choſen People, and teaching them the very prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of true Religion?</p>
               <p>AGAIN: the Hebrew, thus bought by his Brother, and reduced to the condition of a Slave, under the expreſs ſanction of God, was a Child of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion: now, Circumciſion, under the Moſaic Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, was a ſolemn, religious Rite, anſwering that of
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022555_0038_0FB945FC68A80CF0"/>Baptiſm in the Chriſtian Law: it was a token of the Covenant between God and his People<note n="(e)" place="bottom">Gen. c, 17, v. 11.</note>, as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially requiſite in every male perſon, who hoped for acceptance with God<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Gen. 17, 14.</note>, as is Baptiſm in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the New Law. If then, notwithſtanding the prerogative of circumciſion, which made the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Moſaic Law true Children of God, true believers, and members of his Church, a free circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Iſraelite was ſtill ſubject to the law of human bondage or ſlavery, and that even under the dominion of one of his own Communion and Church; from what maxim or principle of true Religion and juſtice does it follow, that a Slave, once admitted into the Covenant of the New Law, acquires by his admiſſion a right to his emancipation from human bondage? that is, a right to deprive his Maſter of his property?</p>
               <p>IN fine; it is manifeſt from the very letter of the Law juſt quoted, that, even in the Caſe of an Hebrew reduced to the condition of a Slave for a limited time, the Maſter's purchaſe of that Slave was ſo eſſentially juſt and lawful in every part of it, that, though, by an eſpecial ordinance of God peculiar to that People only, the Slave was to be releaſed from bondage in the ſeventh year, or the year of the Jubilee; yet the right of property, acquired by that purchaſe, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by God to be ſo veſted in the Maſter, that, if the Maſter had given a wife to his Slave, that is, if the Slave had married a wife during the time of his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with the conſent of his Maſter, both ſhe and her children, if he had any by her, became the Maſter's property for ever: in which caſe it is worth obſerving, that the Slave thus emancipated, though a member of the true Church, was ordered to <hi>go out by himſelf,</hi> and leave his wife and children behind.—A ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022555_0039_0FB945FEED018BA0"/>this between huſband and wife, father and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, well deſerving the particular attention of every religious and humane advocate for African Liberty!— And can any one after this entertain the moſt diſtant doubt on the licitneſs of the <hi>Slave Trade,</hi> ſo poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, ſo unequivocally, ſo ſtrongly authorized by this written ordinance of the Word of God?</p>

               <p n="6">VI. Is there be meaning in language, or ſenſe in words, here is certainly a Law enacted by Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which does not only give a moſt poſitive and

               </p>
               <p>AGAIN: the words of this Law, and they are the words of God, do expreſsly declare, that Slaves thus purchaſed from the Heathen and Sojourners among them, ſhall be the <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> that is, the real and lawful property, of the purchaſers: a property ſo ſtrictly their own, that they ſhall bequeath it to their Children at their death, as a part of their juſt and lawful inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, a part of their paternal eſtate, an eſtate for ever, for <hi>they ſhall be your bond men for ever,</hi> ſays the Law: that is an hereditary eſtate with all the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ariſing from it; and, conſequently, with all the children born from them, agreeable to the tenour of that Law of <hi>Exodus,</hi> which has been explained in the IVth Number of this <hi>Section;</hi> for otherwiſe the children of a Heathen Slave or a Stranger would have enjoyed a privilege, which an Hebrew Slave was denied, though a Slave only for a limited time.</p>
               <p n="7">VII.

Deut. 7, 2, &amp;c.</note>, was afterwards changed by the Almighty into that of perpetual and hereditary bondage or ſlavery, is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance what is never to be found in any part of the Sacred Records; from the whole tenour of which it appears manifeſt, that the perpetual bondage, to which they were conſigned with all their poſterity, was the ſole act and deed of Joſhua, ſuggeſted apparently by the Princes of the Congregation of Iſrael, who, prior to Joſhua's curſe upon them, in order to ſilence the murmurs of the multitude, had declared their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of employing the Gibeonites in the ſervile occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of <hi>hewers of wood, and drawers of water unto all the Congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, had Joſhua's ſentence of perpetual bondage been only a commutation of that of death, to which
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022555_0046_0FB94612E50CECA0"/>the Almighty had condemned the Gibeonites, had it not been lawful in itſelf, on other accounts, to reduce the innocent as well as the guilty to the condition of Slaves; the ſentence of perpetual bondage pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Joſhua, ought, one would imagine, to have extended no farther, than the perſons of the Gibeonites then living, any more than did the ſentence of death, in lieu of which that of perpetual bondage is ſaid to have been ſubſtituted. The ſlavery then of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent poſterity, at leaſt, cannot be ſaid to have been in lieu of death, to which certainly they had never been condemned.</p>
               <p>IT being therefore evident from the uniform tenour of the Sacred Writings, that neither the reduction of the Gibeonites then living, nor that of their guiltleſs deſcendants, yet unborn, to perpetual Slavery, was ever condemned by any mark or intimation whatever of God's diſpleaſure, but manifeſtly ratified in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel by ſeveral undoubted aſſurances of his divine approbation; it is eaſy to conclude, whether the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of the innocent as well as the guilty part of our fellow-creatures to the condition of Slaves, or even to hereditary bondage or Slavery, be in its own nature licit or illicit, criminal or juſt.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. As a mark of the Almighty's undoubted ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Joſhua's conduct in the tranſaction juſt before us, we find in the continuation of this hiſtory<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Joſh. c. 10.</note> that HE even ſecured to his People the poſſeſſion of theſe Slaves, and their poſterity, by a moſt ſignal victory, which he enabled them to obtain over five Kings of the Amorites; who, in conſequence of the Gibeonites having made a league and a treaty of peace with Joſhua and his People, joined all their forces againſt them, and made a vigorous attempt to invade
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022555_0047_0FB946145D45BE70"/>this new acquiſition of the Children of Iſrael. The exertions of his divine power for ſecuring to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this new acquired property of Slaves were ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully great, that he even fought <hi>in Perſon</hi> againſt the invaders; for <q>The Lord, <hi>ſays the Sacred writer, diſcomfitted them before Iſrael, and ſtew them with a great ſlaughter at Gibeon, and chaſed them along the way that goeth up to Bethboron, and ſmote them to Azekab, and unto Makkedab. And it came to paſs, as they fled from before Iſrael, and were in the going down to Bethboron, toat the Lord caſt down great ſtones from heaven upon them unto Aze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah, and they died: they were more which died with bailſtones, than they whom the Children of Iſrael ſlew with the ſword</hi>

               <p>AND, in order to render the victory ſtill more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and the part he took in defending the rights of his people over the Gibeonites more viſible to the whole world, he even wrought a miracle of the moſt ſingular kind: for, <hi>barkning,</hi> as the Sacred Page ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>unto the voice of a Man,</hi> that is, of Joſhua, who, in the heat of action, ordered <hi>the Sun to ſtand ſtill upon Gibeon, and the Moon in the valley of Ajalon,</hi> he ſtayed them both <hi>about a whole day, until the People had avenged themſelves upon their enemies</hi>

IF theſe wonderful atchievements of the power of God in favour of his choſen People in the very caſe of protecting the perſons, whom they had ſo lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to perpetual and hereditary bondage, are not to be conſidered as ſo many evident teſtimonies of his divine approbation of the immediate object of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> and a poſitive ſanction to the licitneſs
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:022555_0048_0FB9461AA26DCFF0"/>of it, but are ſtill conſiſtent with any intrinſic moral turpitude inherent to the nature of that Trade; the abettors of this opinion muſt neceſſarily maintain, that the Supreme Ruler of the Univerſe, in direct oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to his own eſſential attributes and perfections, in manifeſt contradiction with his own moral laws and commandments, and in vindication of ill-gotten pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, diſplayed to the World the moſt extraordinary exertions of his Omnipotence, and diſturbed the very courſe of Nature to make it ſubſervient to the vileſt of purpoſes, injuſtice and oppreſſion. As the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is as blaſphemous as it is neceſſary, the very mentioning of it will, I flatter myſelf, be ſufficient to determine the judgement of any religious and candid Reader in favour of the inherent moral licitneſs of the <hi>Slave-Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">XIII. I HAVE, I think, ſufficiently proved from the Scriptural Paſſages I have produced in the ſeries of this <hi>ſecond part,</hi> that the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> has the poſitive ſanction of Divine Authority in its ſupport, and is perfectly conſonant to the Principles of the Moſaic Diſpenſation delineated in the Sacred Writings of the Word of God.</p>
               <p>I HAVE, however, this one thing to obſerve before I proceed to the <hi>third part,</hi> in order to preclude every avenue to groundleſs objections; that there is not a Place in all the Writings of the Word of God, whether of the <hi>Old</hi> or of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that does ſo much as inſinuate in the moſt diſtant manner, that the Slaves bought either within the period of the Law of Nature, that of the Moſaic Diſpenſation, or that of the Chriſtian Law, were to ſerve during a certain number of years and no longer, except the Hebrew Slaves; who, for reaſons peculiar only to that People, and not applicable even to Chriſtian Slaves, were to
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:022555_0049_0FB9461DB4C56258"/>ſerve no longer than ſix years in the capacity of Bond, Slaves. In every other caſe, the words <hi>Bond man, Bond-woman, Bond maid, Bond ſervant, Servant under the yoke,</hi> imply, in the Scripture-language, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and unlimited bondage, bondage for life, both of the male and female reduced to that condition, and even of their poſterity or children, if they had any. Nor is there one inſtance to be met with in the Sacred Volumes, of the manumiſſion or eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of a Slave of either ſex, except of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew race, who ever obtained releaſe from bondage, on account of having ſerved any determinate number of years.</p>
               <p>THE diſmiſſion of Hagar, bond-woman to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, from her Maſter's houſe, is ſo far from being an inſtance of this kind, that every circumſtance attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her diſcharge ſeems to prove the very reverſe<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Gen. 21, v. 9-14.</note> She was <hi>ſent away</hi> by Abraham, at the earneſt ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his wife Sarai, whoſe counſel the Almighty ordered him to follow: but the reluctance he ſhewed to turn her out of his houſe, when it was firſt propoſed to him by Sarai, for <hi>the thing was very grievous in his ſight</hi> (or, according to the Original, <hi>The word was very bad in the eyes of Abrabam,</hi>) and the reaſon of her diſmiſſion, evidently ſhew that her diſcharge was not in conſequence of any contract whatever, by which ſhe was bound to ſerve a determinate number of years and no longer, there being not the leaſt intimation given in the Sacred Hiſtory of any ſuch contract or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but becauſe her ſon's behaviour to Iſaac, the promiſed and right Heir of the Family, was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly odious and very alarming to Sarai, who, dreading the conſequences of Iſhmael's <hi>perſecution</hi> of young Iſaac, for ſo the Apoſtle ſtyles it<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Galat. c, 4, v. 29.</note>, inſiſted on his being <hi>caſt out</hi> together with his mother Hagar.</p>

THE Scriptural acceptation and extent of the word <hi>Bondage,</hi> and the relatives to it, being thus fixed and aſcert used from the very letter and uniform te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Scripture itſelf, no arguments whatever, grounded on the true and real ſenſe in which that word and its relatives are uſed in the Sacred Page, will ever evince, that a Slave, within the period of any of the Three Diſpenſations of true Religion mentioned in the Sacred Annals of the Word of God, not born an Hebrew, was ever bound by contract or otherwiſe, to ſerve only a limited number of years, at the expiration of which he obtained his freedom, and was left at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to chuſe for himſelf.</p>

            <head>SECTION III. <hi>Scriptural Reſearches on the licitneſs of the Slave-Trade, ſhewing its conformity with che principles of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Diſpenſation delineated in the</hi> Sacred Writings.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THE Chriſtian Diſpenſation, called frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Chriſtian Law, the Law of Chriſt, the Chriſtian Religion, the Law of Grace, the New Law, and the New Covenant or the New Teſtament, is that moſt ſublime and perfect Syſtem of Faith and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which the Eternal Wiſdom of the Father, Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, both preached in Perſon, and ſealed with his precious blood. As this New Law and Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of ſalvation is to remain in full force until the conſummation of all things, or till time ſhall be no more, it is not in the power of any creature to aſcertain the exact time of its duration and exiſtence from the firſt promulgation of it; for <hi>Of that day, and that hour knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in Heaven, neither the</hi> SON, <hi>but the</hi> FATHER.<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Mark c, 13, v. 32.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. THE principal tranſactions relative to this New Law are regiſtered in the ſeveral inſpired Writings, that compoſe the Sacred Volume commonly ſtyled <hi>The New Teſtament.</hi> The principles and moral duties of perpetual obligation reſpecting <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> regiſtered in this Sacred Volume, being evidently dictated by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God, and God himſelf, cannot conſiſtently with the eſſential infallibility of his eternal Wiſdom, bear the leaſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the principles and moral duties of perpetual obligation reſpecting, in like manner, <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Injustice,</hi> dictated by the ſame
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:022555_0052_0FB946248E366998"/>infallible <hi>Spirit,</hi> and regiſtered in the ſeveral inſpired Writings, that compoſe the Sacred Volume com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtyled <hi>The Old Teſtament,</hi> comprehending ſuch tranſactions, as relate to both the Natural and the Moſaic Laws. Were it poſſible to be otherwiſe, God would not be conſiſtent with himſelf, and the Religion of the New Teſtament, inſtead of being the perfection and accompliſhment, would be the reproach and condemnation of both the former Laws, Natural and Moſaic, on the truth of which its very exiſtence depends.</p>
            <p n="3">III. FROM this undeniable poſition it follows neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, that, as the Writings of both the Teſtaments have the ſame weight of Authority, eſſentially inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of contradicting itſelf, in ſupport of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and deciſions, enacted and regiſtered in their reſpective Records, concerning the intrinſic morality or immorality of human actions, whatever is declared in the One to be intrinſically good or bad, juſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, licit or illicit, muſt inevitably be ſo according to the principles of the Other. If, therefore, the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> appears, as, I truſt it does, from the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing train of Scriptural arguments, in perfect harmony with the principles and deciſions of the Word of God, regiſtered in the Sacred Writings of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, reſpecting the intrinſic nature of that Trade, this, of courſe, can bear no oppoſition to, but muſt neceſſarily be in equal perfect harmony with, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and deciſions of the Word of God reſpecting <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> regiſtered in the Sacred Writings of the New.</p>
            <p>THIS general but forcible argument, were it even unſupported by any collateral evidences from the Writings of the New Teſtament, would be fully ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to verify my third and laſt aſſertion reſpecting
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:022555_0053_0FB94625AD9451D8"/>the Licitneſs of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> as perfectly confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the principles of the Chriſtian Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I HAVE been the more particular in bringing this laſt part of my Scriptural Reſearches to this cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral point of view, as I have more than one reaſon to apprehend, that ſeveral of my Readers will be apt to imagine, that, by the eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian Religion, the Law of Moſes was wholly aboliſhed and annulled in every part of it, and to every intent and purpoſe, both typical and moral, of its original inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and that, of courſe, the arguments drawn in vindication of the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> from the Writings of the Old Teſtament, can have no weight of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction or authority with perſons, who are ſubject to no other Laws and Ordinances, but thoſe of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, by which that was entirely laid aſide.</p>
            <p n="5">V. TRUE as this aſſertion is with reſpect to the ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, typical, and ceremonial part of the Moſaic Law, which, in this ſenſe, is now utterly aboliſhed, and no longer obligatory to the Profeſſors of the Goſpel, it is not leſs erroneous and falſe with reſpect to thoſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principles of righteouſneſs enacted in that Law, which relate to the intrinſic morality or immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, licitneſs or illicitneſs of human actions; which, from the invariable nature of Right and Wrong, Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Injuſtice, muſt be of perpetual obligation, and as unchangeable as God himſelf; who never did, nor ever could alter by any Diſpenſation whatever thoſe eternal principles and laws, which are the very baſis and foundation of true Religion, and conſequently of the Religion of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>WE have no leſs an authority in conformation of this indiſputable Doctrine, than the very words of the Son of God, who, in that divine Sermon on the Mount,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:022555_0054_0FB94627283B60A0"/>in which he gave his Diſciples a moſt minute and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial account of the principles and tenets of his Goſpel, condemned the above erroneous opinion in the moſt explicit terms, and forbade them even to think of it: <hi>Think not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy but to fulfil</hi>
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Mat. c, 5, v. 17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was on the principle of this Doctrine of the Son of God, and on purpoſe to guard againſt every exception to arguments drawn from the writings of the Old Teſtament in favour of the</hi> Slave-Trade, <hi>which ſome perſons would be apt to make in conſequence of the above erroneous opinion, that I eſpecially apprized the Reader in the ſecond Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the laſt Section, that the arguments I meant to enforce in that Section in vindication of that Trade, would be entirely grounded, as they certainly are, on ſuch written and explicit laws and principles of internal moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as conſtituted the true morality of the Moſaic Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and not on ſuch Legal obſervances and practices, as were peculiar to it, and conſtituted only the ritual, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical, or ceremonial part of its frame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. THE permanent and indefectible authority of the Old Teſtament, and the neceſſary conformity of the New with the principles and declarations of the former reſpecting the intrinſic nature of <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong, juſtice</hi> and <hi>injuſtice,</hi> being thus firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and aſcertained; I ſhall now prooced, for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument's ſake, to ſubſtantiate in a more particular manner the merits of the preſent Controverſy with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the principles and tenets of the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament; which, from the unanſwerable, though ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, argument juſt enforced, appears already to give; a ſanction to the licitneſs of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic morality of which is ſo evidently warranted
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:022555_0055_0FB94628C7805960"/>by thoſe invariable principles and deciſions of the Old, with which, as proved before, it muſt neceſſarily agree.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. THAT there is nothing in the Writings of the New Teſtament, that can be produced in juſtification of the <hi>Slave-Trade.</hi> has been confidently aſſerted by many, and from this <hi>Juppoſed ſilence</hi> of the Inſpired Writers, they have as confidently concluded, that the profeſſors of Chriſtianity are not juſtifiable in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting a Trade, which, not having, in their opinion, the Sanction of the New Teſtament, muſt of courſe be eſſentially oppoſite to the principles of true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, which forbids in the moſt explicit terms, and under the ſevereſt puniſhments, all acts of injuſtice, unnaturalneſs, and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. THE ſtronger this inference, founded indeed on a falſe ſuppoſition, appears to the advocates for African Liberty againſt the licitneſs of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> the more powerful the following arguments muſt appear to them; which, from the ſame negative principle, not of <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> but <hi>real,</hi> ſilence reſpecting the pretended illicitneſs of it, amounting in fact to a poſitive ſanction in our Caſe, ſeem manifeſtly to evince, that the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> bears no oppoſition whatever to the principles of the Chriſtian Law.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. IF the Writings of the New Teſtament mention nothing, as it is <hi>falſely ſuppoſed,</hi> in vindication of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> neither do they <hi>in reality</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> mention any thing in condemnation of it; if then the <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> ſilence of the Inſpired Writers reſpecting the licitneſs of that Trade, that is, their not mentioning that Trade at all, as it is <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> can be brought as an argument of its moral inconſiſtency with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of true Chriſtianity; the <hi>real</hi> ſilence of the ſame reſpecting the pretended illicitneſs of it, that is, their not condemning the Trade at all, though pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022555_0056_0FB9462A31675E90"/>practiſed in their time, and by the very perſons whom they were deputed to teach the principles and duties of Chriſtianity, muſt be a ſtronger argument by far of the inherent moral conformity of the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> with the principles and tenets of the Religion of Chriſt: for it ſhews in the ſtrongeſt light, that the firſt Teachers of Chriſtianity, who were alſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Writers of the New Teſtament, never conſidered the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> or had been taught by their Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to conſider it, as an infraction of any of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or moral precepts of his Goſpel.</item>
               <item>2. In effect; this conſtant and uniform ſilence of the Sacred Writers of the New Teſtament in a matter of ſuch public notoriety; I mean their never diſapproving the practice of a Trade, in which the rights of Chriſtian juſtice and humanity are ſaid to be ſo materially injured, ought to attract the particular affention of every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial inquirer into the merits of the preſent Controverſy.
<p>IT is an abſolute fact, atteſted by all Hiſtorians, both Sacred and Prophane, that at the very time that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity made its appearance in the World, as well as at the time that the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt were employed in preaching and propagating through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the World his holy Goſpel and Doctrine, both before and after the ſame had been committed to writing, that is, before and after the New Teſtament was written, that the practice of Slavery, or the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> was univerſally adopted by the very Nations to whom they brought the glad tidings of ſalvation, and who, through faith, repentance, and obedience to the maxims and doctrine they preached, were received into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of reconciliation and grace; and yet it is not leſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the conſtant tenour of the Sacred Wrtings of the New Teſtament, that deſiſting from the proſecution of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> or manumitting thoſe who were in actual bondage, was never declated by any of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022555_0057_0FB9462BB3017AD8"/>or firſt Teachers of Chriſtianity to be a neceſſary term of Salvation or acceptance with God, or an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable duty of a follower of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>BUT were the Trade ſo diametrically oppoſite to the principles of Chriſtianity, as it is aſſerted, were it a moſt unjuſtifiable uſurpation of the ſacred rights of juſtice and humanity, would the Apoſtles have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe ſacred rights to be thus invaded and trampled upon with impunity, without ſo much as ſignifying to thoſe, whom they were commiſſioned to teach the Goſpel of righteouſneſs and peace, of love and charity, that it was in open contradiction with the principles and precepts of that Goſpel.</p>
               </item>
               <item>3. IN FINE: this manner of reaſoning to prove the moral conformity of the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, acquires a degree of irreſiſtable force, when applied to the conduct of our Bleſſed Saviour in his public character of Founder and Teacher of the New Law; for though he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced every opportunity of reproving in the ſevereſt terms ſuch irreligious abuſes as were practiſed by the Jews, and of rectifying ſuch falſe gloſſes, traditions, and comments, as had been added by them to the Law of Moſes, yet he never once condemned, reproved, or even hinted the leaſt diſapprobation of the practice of Slavery, ſo generally adopted in his time: no, not even in his Divine Sermon on the Mount, in which he ſpoke on ſet purpoſe of the moſt exalted duties of his Religion, entered into a minute and moſt circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial detail of many reciprocal offices and duties he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of his followers, and rectified ſome abuſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably leſs criminal than would be that of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving our fellow creatures, were this practice ſo very criminal and unjuſt as is repreſented by ſome modern advocates for African Liberty<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Matt. cc, 5, 6, 7.</note>

4. THE fact is: that ſince neither the SON of God, being himſelf God, nor his Diſciples commiſſioned to teach his doctrine, could ever after the intrinſic nature of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong;</hi> once the practice of Slavery, or the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> had been expreſsly declared by the FATHER eſſentially juſt and lawful in the Sacred Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Old Law, which, the SON <hi>did not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil</hi>

            <p>IT follows then, that the argument drawn in favour of the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> from the conſtant ſilence of the Inſpired Writers of the New Teſtament reſpecting the pretended illicitneſs of that Trade, that is, from their never mentioning any thing againſt the licitneſs of it, which in the cirumſtances above related, would have been only a negative inference, though of conſiderable weight in vindication of it, becomes now, from this laſt very material circumſtance, a moſt powerful poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive argument, ſhewing in the ſtrongeſt light, that the nature of the <hi>Slave-Trade</hi> is perfectly conſonant to the principles and tenets of the Chriſtian Law.</p>

XI. THE Apoſtle in theſe words deſcribes two claſſes of Chriſtian Slaves, or Servants under the yoke of bondage: Slaves ſubject to unbelievers, and Slaves ſubject to true believers or Chriſtians; and, according to their reſpective ſituations, he ſpecifies the general duties belonging to each claſs.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. THE former are exhorted to <hi>count their own Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> though Infidels, <hi>worthy of all honour:</hi> that is, they are exhorted to ſhew their Maſters, both in words and actions, ſuch unfeigned marks of honour, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and reſpect, as they have a right to claim, for <hi>they are worthy of all honour,</hi> from the ſuperiority of their rank and ſtation in life, and the authority they have acquired over them by the poſſeſſion of their perſons. The reaſon for enforcing ſuch dutiful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment is very powerful: you are to exhort them, ſays the Apoſtle to Timothy, to behave in this beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming manner, <hi>that the name of God, and his doctrine, be not blaſphemed:</hi> that is, leſt the unbelieving Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſeeing the contrary deportment in their Chriſtian Slaves, attribute their inſolent, diſreſpectful, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient conduct, to the principles and doctrine of their religion, and thus being reproach and infamy upon both.</item>

THE latter Claſs of Chriſtian Slaves, ſubject to Chriſtian Maſters, are earneſtly exhorted, not only not to be leſs reſpectful and obſequious to the latter for being their brethren in Chriſt, and joint members with them of the ſame Communion and Church, as if they were their equals in every reſpect, but an ſhow, on this very account, in their readineſs and zeal to ſerve them, a ſuperior degree of ſubmiſſion and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their lawful authority not conſidering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon a footing of natural equality with thoſe whoſe Slaves they are, though entitled at the ſame

From the tenour of theſe Apoſtolic inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, confirmed by many other ſimilar declarations to the ſame effect, frequently occurring in the Writings of the New Teſtament, I am naturally led to deduce the following conſequences in ſupport of the licitneſs of the <hi>Slave-Trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. IT is then evident from the Doctrine of St. Paul, that Chriſtians, however entitled by Baptiſm to the Spiritual freedom of Children of God, and Heirs of heaven, ought yet, when under the yoke of human bondage or ſlavery, conſider themſelves under the ſtricteſt obligation of reverencing the authority of their Maſters, even of unbelieving Maſters, <hi>and counting them worthy of all honour.</hi> But were the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> or the keeping of our fellow-creatures in bondage, unnatural and unjuſt, it could never be ſaid, that Slaves were under the leaſt obligation in conſcience to reverence and obey an unjuſt, an unnatural authority; or that their Maſters, who, by reducing them to that abject condition, had trampled on the Sacred Rights of juſtice and humanity, <hi>were worthy of all honour,</hi> or, indeed, of any ſhadow of honour, but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, of all diſhonour and reproach.</item>
                  <item>2. IT is likewiſe evident from the Apoſtle's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that the primitive Chriſtians were not only not forbidden, but expreſsly allowed by the principles of our Religion the purchaſing of Slaves, and keeping their fellow-creatures, nay even their fellow-Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, under the yoke of bondage or Slavery; and from the circumſtance of their Slaves being ſo particularly cautioned not to conſider themſelves on the footing of natural equality with their Maſters, not to deſpiſe them and their authority for being their equals in all ſpiritual attainments and franchiſes, but to ſhow, on
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:022555_0062_0FB946332A389800"/>this very account, a greater degree of readineſs and alacrity to render them due ſervice, their Maſters are evidently declared to have had a juſt and indiſputable claim to that ſervice, as their own lawful property.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="13">XIII. NEITHER can it be ſaid, that this doctrine, perhaps, novel to ſome of my Readers, which Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy is directed <hi>to teach and to exhort,</hi> was only the private opinion of St. Paul; for he declares to him in expreſs words, that it is <hi>a doctrine according to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> the very doctrine of Chriſt himſelf, and not to be contradicted by any one, without incurring the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated guilt of pride and folly with a criminal train of attendants: <q>

               </list>
               <p n="19">XIX. THE following obvious remarks, adapted to the ſubject of our preſent inquiry reſpecting the moral licitneſs of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> ſeem naturally to ariſe from the tenour of this ſacred portion of Scripture.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The Apoſtle declares in the firſt place, that, were he to act in the plentitude of his. Apoſtolic commiſſion and Authority, without any regard to the dictates of his love and friendſhip for Philem on, he would not uſe the ſtyle of a ſuppliant, as he does, but would pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily enjoin him to receive his fugitive Slave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houſe and ſervice, which he is bound to do in decency and duty: the word <hi>Convenient</hi> in the Original has both theſe meanings. From which declaration it evidently, follows, that the Apoſtle was ſo far from thinking, that Philemon had acted wrong or unjuſtly in keeping Oneſimus in bondage, when yet an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022555_0066_0FB946D82A35EC68"/>that he aſſures him, on the contrary, he would act in oppoſition to his duty, or unjuſtly, in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him again, when baptized, into his houſe and ſervice.</item>
                  <item>2. This declaration acquires a ſuperior degree of force from the circumſtance he ſubjoins to his requeſt, as a powerful inducement for Philemon to receive him again into his ſervice. This circumſtance, alluding to the name of <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> which in Greek is the ſame as <hi>Profitable,</hi> is both beautiful and intereſting. The Apoſtle owns, without diſguiſe, that Oneſimus, <hi>in time paſt bad</hi> certainly <hi>been an unprofitable,</hi> or, in Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>language, <hi>a bad Servant</hi>
                     <note n="(k)" place="bottom">Matt. c, 25. v. 30.</note>: but, as he could now aſſure Philemon, that he was quite reclaimed, and become <hi>profitable</hi> to both, he earneſtly ſolicits his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, in order that he may be enabled to make amends for his paſt negligence and inattention to his ſervice by his future diligence and aſſiduity.—It was then Oneſimus's duty to have been uſeful and <hi>profitable</hi> to his Maſter Philemon, whilſt under the yoke of ſervitude; and it was an act of manifeſt injuſtice in him to have been <hi>unprofitable</hi> and of no ſervice. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon then had a <hi>juſt</hi> and undoubted right to the ſervice of Oneſimus, as his Slave; or elſe Oneſimus could never have been taxed by the Apoſtle with acting the part of an <hi>unprofitable</hi> or <hi>bad ſervant,</hi> or with any perſonal <hi>injuſtice,</hi> for neglecting a ſervice, which Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon had no right or title to demand.</item>
                  <item>3. Again: to convince Philemon, how much One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus was changed for the better ſince his elopement, and the great reformation that his converſion to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity had wrought in his morals and conduct, he tells him, how much he was inclined himſelf to keep him in his own ſervice; intimating to him in this delicate and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:022555_0067_0FB946D9B5F71FE0"/>gentle manner, that he could have no objection to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive again into his ſervice a perſon ſo well qualified, as Oneſimus was then, to be an Apoſtle's Servant: and he aſſures him further, that the only reaſon that has prevented him from indulging his inclination to detain him, has been his not having had his leave and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for ſo doing; <hi>without which,</hi> ſays he, he would never attempt to deprive him of his Slave. From this declaration it appears in the ſtrongeſt light, how very ſacred and inviolable the acquired rights of Maſters over their Slaves, even of Chriſtian Maſters and Slaves, were held by St. Paul, who would not by any means deprive Philemon of Oneſimus, however uſeful the latter was to him at that time, and whatever aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency he had over his Maſter, without having firſt obtained his expreſs approbation and conſent: he would then, ſays he, receive Oneſimus, as a <hi>benefit</hi> perfectly gratuitous, as a free and voluntary gift made to him by Philemon of ſo valuable a part of his property.</item>
                  <item>4. Till he obtains this conſent, he ſends Oneſimus back to his lawful Maſter, entreating him in the moſt preſſing and affectionate manner, to uſe him with all poſſible tenderneſs and regard: to conſider him now as a member of the Communion of the true believers, and conſequently not in the character of a common menial Slave, but as his own brother in Chriſt, though ſtill his property <hi>according to the fleſh,</hi> which to him particularly ought to be dearer then ever, as being now conſecrated to God.—And leſt Philemon ſhould inſiſt on Oneſimus making due ſatisſaction for having deſrauded him of his time, or other property, and ſhould, on that account, uſe him with ſeverity, the Apoſtle engages to make him full reparation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes himſelf reſponſible for the whole: which is a
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:022555_0068_0FB946DB2867EAF8"/>manifeſt acknowledgement of Philemon's right, as the lawful Maſter of Oneſimus, to inflict due puniſhment on his <hi>Slave.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p n="20">XX. From theſe obſervations, ſo naturally flowing from the Contents of the Apoſtle's letter to Philemon, theſe two neceſſary conſequences ſeem as naturally to follow.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Had St. Paul, who had been inſtructed in the principles of the Chriſtian Religion, not by men, but immediately by Chriſt himſelf<note n="(l)" place="bottom">Galat. c, 1, v. 1.</note>, <hi>whoſe choſen veſſel he was to bear his name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the Children of Iſrael</hi>
                     <note n="(m)" place="bottom">Acts c, 9, v. 15.</note>, been taught by his Divine Maſter, that the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> or the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing of Slaves, or keeping thoſe already purchaſed in ſervitude or bondage, was an unnatural, iniquitous purſuit, contrary to the Spirit of his Religion, he would have certainly addreſſed himſelf to Philemon in a very different ſtyle from that of his preſent Letter: and inſtead of acting the part of a Suppliant, the part of an interceſſor and Mediator, as he does, in ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him the re-admiſſion of a fugitive Slave, he would have aſſumed the ſtyle and tone of a Maſter; would have ſeverely condemned the unjuſtifiable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Philemon in detaining him in criminal bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, contrary to the Laws of his holy Religion, would have commended the ſpirited conduct of Oneſimus in ſhaking off the heavy yoke of ſervitude, would not have ſuffered him to return to his unnatural Maſter Philemon, eſpecially after he had converted him to Chriſtianity, and entitled him by Baptiſm to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious franchiſes and liberty of the Children of God, and would not have ſtood on complimentary ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, finding him uſeful in his actual ſtate of confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:022555_0069_0FB946DCB0546408"/>to retain him in his miniſtry, without aſking his pretended Maſter's leave, or without his conſent.
<p>THIS, I am confident, would have been the language and conduct of the Apoſtle, had he been taught by his Divine Maſter, that the principles and Doctrine of the Goſpel, he was commiſſioned to preach, were in direct oppoſition to the practice of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> to the practice of purchaſing Slaves, or keeping thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready purchaſed in bondage or ſlavery.</p>

               <p n="21">XXI. EVIDENT as this concluſion appears from the Scriptural arguments enforced in the courſe of this Section, I cannot cloſe the Subject of theſe Reſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, without taking ſome notice of what, I apprehend, will be objected againſt it from the Words of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour in his divine Sermon on the Mount, which in the eighth Number of this Section I declared with
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:022555_0070_0FB946DE2BA95A58"/>particular ſtreſs to contain nothing againſt the licitneſs of the <hi>Slave-Trade.</hi>—The Words, bere alluded to, will, I preſume, be thus retorted againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All things whatſoever,</hi> ſays our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets</hi>
                  <note n="(n)" place="bottom">Matt. c, 7, v. 12.</note>: whatſoever things therefore we would not, that men ſhould do to us, we are not even ſo to do to them; but no perſon whatever would certainly wiſh, that a fellow-creature ſhould reduce him to the condition of a Slave; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no perſon whatever is to reduce a fellow-creature to that condition.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. HERE again I muſt obſerve, that no one can juſtly tax me with any partiality to the Cauſe I have eſpouſed: I have, I think, worded the argument againſt it in terms as forcible, as the moſt zealous advocate for African Liberty, could uſe. But unanſwerable as the ſame may appear to them, it is but a plauſible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the beſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is an Axiom in Logic, that An argument that proves too much, proves nothing: the above is juſt ſuch a one: for, by the ſame manner of reaſoning, one might equally conclude, contrary to the Law and the Prophets, and the doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion, that not only Slavery, but every other kind of ſubordination of one man to another, ought not to be ſuffered to continue in the world.—The argument, if concluſive in the former caſe, muſt be equally ſo in the latter:</hi> I enforce it thus: <hi>All things whatſoever,</hi> ſays our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets:</hi> whatſoever things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we would not that men ſhould do to us, we are not even ſo to do to them; but every perſon would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:022555_0071_0FB946DFAAE9B7C0"/>wiſh not to be controlled by a fellow-creature, not to be under any ſubjection to him, but to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute maſter of his own actions; no perſon therefore ought to keep a fellow-creature under any control or ſubjection whatever.</p>
               <p n="23">XXIII. SUCH is the conſequence of wreſting the natural and obvious meaning of the maxims of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and applying them to purpoſes inconſiſtent with Scripture itſelf. The Golden Maxim of our Divine Maſter, comprehending in two words the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of a Chriſtian, was certainly intended by him for all ſtations in life, for of ſuch was his Church to conſiſt to the end of time: from the Throne to the Cottage, in every walk of life, in bondage or at liberty, every Chriſtian is taught and directed To do unto others, as he would be done unto; and, by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequence. Not to do unto others, as he would not be done unto that is, every Chriſtian is commanded to behave to his neighbour, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſituation or circumſtances in life Providence may have placed them both, juſt as he would wiſh his neighbour would behave to him in his ſituation, were his neighbour's ſituation and circumſtances his own: ſo that, to apply the Maxim to a particular Caſe (even the Caſe in queſtion), no Chriſtian Maſter can be ſaid <hi>to do unto others as he would be done unto,</hi> unleſs he behaves to his Slave with the ſame tenderneſs, juſtice, and humanity, as he would wiſh his Slave would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have to him, were the Slave his Maſter, and himſelf the Slave; and, upon the ſame principle, no Slave can be ſaid <hi>to do unto others as he would be done unto,</hi> unleſs he ſerves his Maſter with the ſame fidelity, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and reſpect, which he would expect from his Maſter, were the latter his Slave, and himſelf the Maſter.</p>

XXIV. THE <hi>Golden Maxim</hi> then, of <hi>doing unto others, as we would be done unto,</hi> is ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning in the moſt diſtant manner the proſecution of the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> that, when applied to the Caſe of Chriſtian Maſters and their Slaves, it ſerves, on the contrary, to enforce their reciprocal duties in their different ſpheres of life. Neither could it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſeeing, that the ſame Divine Authority, on which the truth of the above Maxim is founded, has ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently given his ſanction in the writings of both the Teſtaments to the licitneſs of the <hi>Slave-Trade.</hi>
