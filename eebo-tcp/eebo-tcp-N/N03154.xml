            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:003812_0002_10025F78D9282B98"/>Before I enter into the Particulars of your Oath, it may not, I think, be improper to ſay ſomething, in the firſt place, of the Nature of <hi>Oath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> in general.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Oath</hi> then is a Religious Aſſeveration, by which we either Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Mercy, or imprecate the Vengeance of Heaven, if we ſpeak not the Truth. This appears from the form of words in which it is expreſſed, to wit, <hi>So help you God.</hi> This is look'd upon as the moſt Sacred Tye, the ſtrongeſt Band on Mens Minds, the ſureſt and beſt means to find out and diſcover the Truth; for it is not to be imagined, though ſome few may poſſibly be found ſo hardned in ſin, that Men in general will be ſo daring as to appeal to the GOD of Infinite Knowledge and Power, for the Truth of what they ſay, and yet Corruptly and Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Perjure themſelves.

            </p>
            <p>NOW, as to your <hi>OATH,</hi> the firſt Things required in it, are <hi>Diligence</hi> in your <hi>Enquiries,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in your <hi>Preſentments. You shall Diligently Enquire, and True Preſentment make. Diligence</hi> is to ſpur you on in finding out <hi>Offenders,</hi> that their <hi>Crimes</hi> may be <hi>Detected,</hi> and that they may be brought to <hi>Condign Punishment,</hi> according to their Demerits, and <hi>Truth</hi> is to be your <hi>Guide,</hi> the <hi>Compaſs</hi> you are to ſteer by, that the <hi>Innocent</hi> be not called into <hi>Judgment,</hi> and that the <hi>Guilty</hi> eſcape Not.</p>
            <p>AND this <hi>Enquiry</hi> is to be of all ſuch Matters as ſhall be given you in <hi>Charge,</hi> or ſhall come to your <hi>Knowledge;</hi> for as you are choſen from the different Parts of this City, it is to be preſumed, that you muſt have heard of moſt Things which happen within it.</p>

            <p>THE Next thing conſiderable in your <hi>Oath</hi> is, <hi>The Temper of Mind you ought to bear in all your Enquiries.</hi> You are not to ſuffer <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Ill-Will</hi> ſo far to prevail with you, as, without juſt Cauſe, to <hi>Preſent</hi> an <hi>Innocent Perſon,</hi> neither ought <hi>Love, Fear, Favour, Affection, Reward</hi> or <hi>Hopes</hi> thereof, ſway you to leave any thing <hi>Unpreſented;</hi> for your <hi>Oath</hi> ought to out-weigh any Conſiderations: And you ought to <hi>Preſent</hi> things Truly, as they come to your Knowledge. <hi>Truth</hi> is the <hi>Rule</hi> you are to walk by, and is the moſt Eſſential part of your <hi>Duty,</hi> and if of ſo much Conſideration in the Service to which you are now choſen, that it forms the Beginning and Concluſion of the Oath you have taken.

            <p>Now as ſome general Notion of what the Law declares to be <hi>Offences,</hi> is requiſite to this End, it is the Office of Us who ſit here, to aſſiſt and direct you. And this leads me to mention ſome Particulars.</p>

A Man lies in one part of the Houſe, his Servant in another, and between them there is a Door latch'd, and the Servant in the Night time draws the Latch, and enters his Maſters Chamber to Murder him, though he does not effect it, yet it is <hi>Burglary.</hi> As there muſt be a <hi>breaking,</hi> ſo there muſt be an <hi>entring:</hi> Stepping over the Threſhold, putting in the Hand, or a Hook, or a Piſtol, within the Door or Window, all theſe the Law calls <hi>Entrings.</hi> A Thief broke a Pane in a Glaſs-Window, and took our Goods with a Hook, this was found to be <hi>Burglary.</hi> Several Men come to commit a <hi>Burglary,</hi> one breaks and enters, the others ſtay at the Door, or at the Corner of the Street, to watch; they are all guilty of <hi>Burglary:</hi> This by Law ſhall be adjudged the <hi>breaking</hi> and <hi>entring</hi> of them all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arſon</hi> is another <hi>Felony</hi> againſt the Habitation of a Man. If any do voluntarily and maliciouſly burn the Dwelling-houſe of another, this is called <hi>Arſon,</hi> and is <hi>Felony.</hi> One <hi>Maliciouſly burns</hi> his own Houſe to the intent to burn another's, if his own be only burnt, then it is a <hi>high Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor;</hi> if the others alſo, then it is <hi>Felony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next <hi>Felony</hi> I ſhall mention, is <hi>Robbery,</hi> which is a <hi>Violent</hi> and <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonious</hi> taking away from the Perſon of another, Money or Goods, to any Value, <hi>putting him in fear.</hi> If a Thief, with or without a Weapon drawn, bid me deliver my Purſe, and I do it, it is a Taking ſufficient to make it a <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</hi> If a man ſeeking to make his eſcape, caſt his Purſe into a Buſh, or let his Hat fall off, the Thief takes them up, it is <hi>Robbery.</hi> Taking in the Preſence of the Party, is, in Law, a Taking from the Perſon. If ſeveral come in Company together to Rob, the one only actually does it, and the others are at ſome diſtance, yet all are guilty of the Robbery.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Felonies</hi> that I have mentioned, are called <hi>Mix'd Larcenies. Simple Larceny</hi> is the <hi>Felonious</hi> and <hi>Fraudulent</hi> taking away by any Perſon, of the the meer Perſonal Goods of another, not from his Perſon, nor out of his Houſe; if this be above the Value of <hi>Twelve Pence,</hi> it is <hi>grand Larceny,</hi> if under, <hi>petty Larceny,</hi> for which the <hi>offender</hi> ſhall be <hi>whipt.</hi> If two ſteal G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ds to the Value of <hi>Thirteen Pence,</hi> this is <hi>grand Larceny</hi> in both. If one Perſon at ſeveral times, at one time ſteals <hi>four Pence,</hi> at another <hi>ſix Pence,</hi> at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>three Pence,</hi> from one Perſon, in all amounting to above <hi>twelve pence,</hi> it is ſaid, all theſe put together in one Indictment, amount to <hi>grand Larceny,</hi> and Judgment of <hi>Death</hi> muſt be given, unleſs in caſes where Clergy is not taken away.</p>
            <p>Moſt of theſe Offences that I have mentioned are <hi>Capital.</hi> I ſhall only take Notice of one or two which are not Capital, and then diſmiſs you

               <hi>As to the ſecond Point, he ſays,</hi> Sect. <hi>10.</hi> 
               <q>It is certain, not only be who compoſes or procures another to compoſe it, but alſo that he who publishes, or procures another to publish it, are in danger of being punished for it; And it is ſaid, not to be material whether he who diſperſes a <hi>Libel,</hi> knew any thing of the Contents or Effects of it, or not; for nothing could be more eaſie than to publish the moſt Virulent Papers with the greateſt Security, if the concealing the purport of them from an illiterate Publisher, would make him ſafe in the diſperſing them. Alſo, it hath been ſaid That if he who hath either Read a <hi>Libel</hi> himſelf, or hath heard it Read by another, do afterwards Maliciouſly Read or Repeat any part of it in the preſence of others, or lend or shew it to another, he is guilty of an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Publication of it.
