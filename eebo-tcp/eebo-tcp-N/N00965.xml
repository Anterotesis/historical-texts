            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Perfection and Extenſive Uſefulneſs of the Word of God, are eminently and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably conſpicuous in this, that the Duties of every Station are therein Propounded and adjuſted, from thence to be diſcovered and learned. Superiours as well as Inferiours are here Counſelled, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and Commanded: and thoſe who ſtand upon a Level, are likewiſe adviſed of their mutual Obligations. However diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Perſons are, as to their Particular Poſts or Provinces, the ſeveral Duties are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

made known and preſcribed, that belong thereunto; they are from hence certifyed, how they ſhould manage themſelves, ſo as to Adorn the Doctrine of God their Saviour, be accepted of, and Walk with Him, and at length be recompenc'd as Good and Faithful Servants. In this Directory, thoſe of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary</hi> Order are not overlook'd, nor left Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplin'd: there are hints in it, not a few nor obſcure, concerning the Religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, that all ſuch are to be Solicitous about, and Exemplary in; how in the Name of the Lord, they are to lift up their Banners, and proceed in all their Enterprizes. I ſhall Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay to Recommend, one Branch of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who belong to this Order, as it is held forth in the Words now offered to conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; accounting a Reflection thereon, not altogether unſuitable to the Occaſion of the preſent Day and Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Pſalm</hi> before us was compoſed, either when the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God, was under eminent diſtreſs and danger, by reaſon of Potent and Prevailing Enemies, or with reſpect unto, and under the proſpect of ſuch a Time. The Spirit and carriage that became ſuch a day, are here diſcovered and exemplified; and that, for Inſtruction to the Church of God in all the following Ages of it. In the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> the Mercies of God in

Planting or Setling the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Promiſe unto their Fore-fathers in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in Extirpating their Enemies from thence, are thankfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated. That the Memory of the Great Works of God, be tranſmitted unto, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved among their Poſterity, hath been the Pious and Sedulous care of his People; and indeed his Glory is greatly concerned in it, a foundation being thus laid, of Praiſes to him in after Generations. The Reports handed down from Ancient times, are here Reflected on with due reſentments. <hi>We have heard with our Ears, O God, our Fathers have told us, what work thou didſt in their days, in the times of old;</hi> thus the <hi>Pſalm</hi> begins. Which Words relate, to the Victories gained, in <hi>Moſes'</hi>s and <hi>Joſhua'</hi>s times; and theſe are acknowledged to be the Effects of Divine Power, and the Reſult of Divine Favour, as in the 2<hi>d.</hi> &amp; 3<hi>d.</hi> verſes, <hi>How thou didſt drive out the Heathen, &amp; Plantedſt them, how thou didſt afflict the people and caſt them out,</hi> or rather, didſt cauſe them to ſhoot forth: <hi>For they got not the Land in Poſſeſſion by their own Sword, neither did their own arm ſave them; but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, becauſe thou hadſt a favour unto them.</hi> Which conſideration was preſented, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated, by <hi>Joſhua</hi> himſelf, as we may ſee in <hi>Joſh.</hi> 24. 12. and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. 3.

to God, and dependance on him, are ſolemnly profeſt, and Deliverance implor'd, as in the 4<hi>th.</hi> verſe, <hi>Thou art my King, O God: command deliverance for Jacob.</hi> Having made this Profeſſion, they further expreſs their hope in God, that, as he had appeared and wrought wonderfully for their Progenitors, he would not be wanting to reſcue and deliver them, from their eminent dangers: as in the 5<hi>th.</hi> v. The profeſſion of their dependence upon God, is amplifyed by their diſclaiming other depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies; as in the Words of our Text, <hi>For I will not truſt in my bow: neither ſhall my ſword ſave me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Words are ſpoken in the Name of Gods <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with reſpect unto their Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made, and Forces employed, againſt their common Enemies. The ſingular number is uſed, to denote the concurrence of the whole Body of the People, in this Profeſſion, that they joyned in it with one conſent. The Terms in our Text, are not difficult, neither is the Senſe of the Words Clouded, or perplexed with different Readings; a brief gloſs may therefore ſuffice for the Explanation of them. By <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> are intended, all Military Weapons and Inſtruments, whether Offenſive or Defenſive; theſe being put for all others of whatever kind, becauſe they were moſt commonly improved, at that time, when this

Sacred Writing was Penn'd: all Skill, Strength, and Courage, to employ theſe, or ſuch like, and all Warlike furniture, aids, and ſuccours are alſo ſignify'd hereby. <hi>I will not truſt in my Bow,</hi> 'tis not ſaid, that they would not uſe or employ their <hi>Bow,</hi> or that they eſteem'd it an indifferent matter whether they did or no, but that they would not <hi>truſt,</hi> or confide in it. <hi>Neither ſhall my Sword Save me,</hi> they did not propoſe to lay it aſide, as unneceſſary, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable; they did not allot upon ſafety and deliverance, did not expect that their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſhould be defeated and ſubdued, without any means uſed, to guard againſt and reſiſt them. Thoſe Expreſſions in the preceeding verſe, of <hi>Puſhing down their Enemies, and tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them under,</hi> intimate their activity and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in order to conqueſt. Not <hi>truſting</hi> in theſe, not being <hi>Saved</hi> by them, do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imply, that altho' they were to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, and their beſt to be done in that way, yet their <hi>truſt</hi> ſhould be placed elſewhere for <hi>Safety;</hi> and where they ſhould place it, the Verſes fore-going and following plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, <abbr>Viz.</abbr>

               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine comprizeth ſeveral things, and perhaps not improper for our Meditation at preſent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The People of God are often Aſſaulted by, and greatly Expoſed to the Rage and Violence of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Enemies.</hi> There would be no need of <hi>Sword</hi> or <hi>Bow,</hi> where there no Enemies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; and had not Sin entred the World, there would not have been any. Perfect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity continued, until Sin made a Rupture. Man by his Revolt from God, loſt that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty over the Creatures, which was at firſt granted to, or veſted in him, ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of yielding Service and Subjection unto him, they often make head againſt, and ſpoil upon him. But furthermore, an unnatural Enmity of mankind againſt each other is the woful fruit of the Apoſtacy. The Luſts of men produce in them more Savage diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and oftimes engage them in more Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practices, then the greateſt Rage or Fierceneſs of bruit Creatures ever bewray'd.

They purſue each others deſtruction with an implacable hatred, inſatiably thirſting after blood, and delighting to imbrew their hands therein. The bloody Wars that have been carry'd on, from the firſt Ages of the World, are an Undenyable Proof, of the deep cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of man's Nature: for who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that man was at firſt framed, by a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of infinite Goodneſs, with any ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, as are then manifeſted? And it is a clear evidence of the dreadful Wrath of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Sinful World, that men ſhould be the Executioners of each other, with a worſe then ferocious cruelty. What a prodigious and frightful carriage, do ſome furious Battels and Sieges produce? Things could not poſſibly have been at this paſs, if man had continued in friendſhip with his Maker. But the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, are of all others, moſt obnoxious to the fury of Enemies; not that they give more occaſion for it, but becauſe of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that is fix'd, between the Seed of the Woman and the Seed of the Serpent. The Little Flook of Chriſt, is hem'd round with devouring Wolves, who are always ſpiteing of it, gnaſhing their teeth upon it, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times actually making a prey thereof. From the days of <hi>Abel,</hi> and throughout the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Ages of the World, the faithful Servants of God have been maligned, and maliciouſly

The Church hath always had Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies combining and conſpiring for its Ruin, and thoſe not mean and contemptible, but mighty, and formidable. <hi>Her Adverſaries are the chief, her Enemies proſper,</hi> Lam. 1. 5. How frequently were the Neighbouring Nations confederated, <hi>to root out the Name and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Iſrael from the Earth?</hi> From the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the Chriſtian Church, and wherever it hath made any figure, all manner of hoſtile methods, have been Employ'd to deſtroy it. When <hi>all the Earth hath been ſtill, and all quiet,</hi> yet then hath <hi>Zion been comfortleſs, and Judah ſcattered,</hi> through the reſtleſs malice, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of their Adverſaries.

Their Enemies being ſo many, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, it concerns them to uſe or improve all ſuitable means, for their own defence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; among which their <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Bow</hi> are to be numbred. <hi>Prayers of Faith</hi> are fitly enough ſtiled the Saints <hi>Artillery,</hi> but theſe are not inconſiſtent, with the uſe of <hi>Outward Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons; Joſhua muſt chooſe out men, and fight with Amalek,</hi> while <hi>Moſes</hi> is lifting up his hands in the Mount, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>We may eaſily concede, that War is not for it ſelf deſireable, or eligible: that the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sword is not to be drawn upon every ſlight occaſion; ſuch a ſevere Remedy is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proper in a deſperate caſe. <hi>To delight in War</hi> is mention'd as a bad Character, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 30. as arguing a baſe mercenary Spirit, a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous

blood-thirſty diſpoſition, or an inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable ambitious humour. 'Tis notorious, that the principles upon which the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake in War, are unjuſtifyable, yea very hateful &amp; abominable; and that the moſt of Wars, are as to their riſe, ſource, and original extreamly evil. The Wars of Sovereign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and of free States, what are they for the moſt part better than a more plauſible and powerful Sort of Piracies? being deſign'd <hi>to remove the bounds of the People, to rob their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and put down the Inhabitant,</hi> as was ſpoken of the Aſſyrians incurſions and conqueſts; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 7, 13. Although theſe things be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily granted, yet the unlawfulneſs of War in all caſes, may not from thence be concluded.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now diſpute, nor undertake to determine what conſiderations, will Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate a War; but only obſerve, that neither the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> nor the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the Mind and Will of God in his <hi>Word,</hi> interdict the <hi>Uſe of Arms,</hi> but it is countenanced, and warranted by both. This is conſonant to the impreſſions and dictates of the Law of Nature, one principal branch whereof, is Self-defence, or preſervation. Moſt evident is it, that a Government hath no ſecurity, againſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, or inſurrections of Male Contents, nor againſt the Hoſtilities, Encroachments, and Uſurpations of Forreigners; that there can
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001159_0012_0FB090FFB634E078"/>
be no good Order maintained, nor Juſtice have its free courſe; that all Civil and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Liberty would ſoon be raviſh'd by Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable men; that Violence, Oppreſſions and Rapine would univerſally and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prevail; that Humane Societies (as things now are) muſt disband, without the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Military Weapons. Now if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults and Outrages of Enemies, cannot ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily be prevented or repreſt without this, it may well be eſteemed a juſt and lawful method.</p>
               <p>And there is nothing repugnant hereunto in the Holy Scriptures: for however ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sacred Oracles may ſpeak in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe the corrupt natures of men are apt to exceed and over-do herein, yet there are ſufficient mediums to confirm our Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obvious in both Teſtaments. We find Directions given by God himſelf, to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of old, about the manner wherein they ſhould manage their Wars, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 2, 3, 10, &amp;c. We find it threatned as a ſore Judgment, a preſage of ruin and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: <hi>That the Lord will take away from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and from Judah, the Mighty man, and the Man of War, Iſa.</hi> 3. 2, 8. We find a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe as a bleſſing, that accompanies the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of bleſſings, even, that <hi>the Lord of Hoſts would be for Strength to thoſe that turn the Battel
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001159_0013_0FB09100A3F4F4C0"/>
in the Gate.</hi> We find that ſome of the moſt Eminent Saints, whoſe Names and Acts are Enrolled in the Sacred Pages, have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Military Atchievements: And we alſo find inſtances of ſome in our Saviours days, and of his Apoſtles, who were Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by profeſſion, who had received and held their Commiſſions from Heathen Rulers, and yet their faith is highly celebrated. And we find alſo Predictions in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> about the Wars of the Church with <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which are propounded with manifeſt approbation. And Authentick Hiſtory informs us, that many of the Primitive Chriſtians, Served the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours in their Wars, and were juſtly reputed the beſt or braveſt of their Souldiers: thoſe who apologized for them againſt their Perſecutors, inſiſted on this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their Loyalty and Uſefulneſs, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> their readineſs to bear Arms, and expertneſs to uſe them for the Publick Good: <hi>The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Legion was the wonder of the Empire, and the terrour of its Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There have indeed been many Arguments advanced, to prove the work of a Souldier, and ſo the uſe of Arms unlawful, both by perſons of an Enthuſiaſtick Spirit, &amp; by ſome who have pretended to judge, more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by Reaſon in matters of Religion: but all their pretenſions are ill-grounded, and of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001159_0014_0FB091022F12C418"/>
dangerous conſequence. It is obſervable, that the Arguments inſiſted on by ſuch, have a direct tendence to ſubvert or undermine the foundations of Civil Government; they bear hard upon the Magiſtrates Office, who is by God himſelf entruſted with the <hi>Sword,</hi> and who if he <hi>would not bear it in vain,</hi> muſt ſometimes unſheath and weild it <hi>againſt thoſe who do evil.</hi> Whereas it is pleaded, that to uſe the Sword, is directly contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Goſpel, and to thoſe Leſſons of Humility, Meekneſs, Patience, and Love that are therein given; the invalidity of the plea, may eaſily be demonſtrated. 'Tis true, <hi>Chriſt came not to deſtroy mens lives; but to ſave them, Luk.</hi> 9. 56. and therefore a cruel ſanguinary Spirit, ill becomes the profeſſion of Diſciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to ſuch a Saviour: but that the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Souldiers, doth not neceſſarily imply ſuch a Spirit, is moſt certain. The preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and not the deſtruction of mens lives, is the primary end of that profeſſion; the deſtruction of none, any further than it is neceſſary, &amp; conducive to the Publick Weal is to be purſued thereby. As for thoſe Directions given to Chriſtians, of <hi>not reſiſting evil,</hi> of <hi>doing good to them that hate them, of recompencing to none evil for evil,</hi> of <hi>not avenging themſelves, but giving place to wrath,</hi> they are groſly ſtrain'd &amp; wreſted, if not underſtood and interpreted with reſpect
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001159_0015_0FB09103A4619558"/>
to private Retaliations. That theſe are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to bind the hands of the Magiſtrate, from taking due revenges on thoſe who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb or endanger the Common-wealth, who would root out Religion, enſlave or deſtroy the People, is manifeſt from what is expreſt, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger to execute wrath.</hi> 'Tis certain, that the Sword was not ordained to Convert the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from infidelity, but the Preaching of the Everlaſting Goſpel: As where the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is aright entertained, there is a meek and lowly Spirit, ſo to promote and propagate the intereſt thereof, agreeable methods ſhould be uſed: but this hinders not, but that the People of God, may with their Swords en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to defend themſelves, confront their Enemies, and recover their own juſt rights.</p>
               <p>I ſhall further add here, that altho' God needs not inſtruments to do his work, yet ordinarily he improves, them; and it is to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

gave them the Land, yet their Enemies were diſpoſſeſt thereof in a Warlike manner. And afterwards, when any notable deliverance was given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> from the Oppreſſions and Ravages of their Enemies, ſome certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were raiſed up, who ſignaliz'd themſelves with a Martial Spirit, to be their Saviours: the Valour and Power of the <hi>Judges</hi> were from the Spirit of the Lord moving in and reſting upon them. And of later days, the Salvations afforded to the People of God, have been wrought out, or effected for them in this way. Conclude we then, that the People of God may, yea it is their Duty, to employ their Arms againſt their Enemies, when Environ'd and moleſted by them; that vigilance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence are to be expreſt for this purpoſe; and thoſe who thus employ them in a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful cauſe, do as truly fight the Battels of the Lord, as thoſe of old did.</p>

is ſuch a truſt diſclaimed, or renounced in our Text? <hi>I will not truſt in my Bow, my Sword ſhall not ſave me.</hi> The Vanity, Sinfulneſs &amp; danger of ſuch a truſt may be here conſidered, as the ground &amp; reaſons why it ſhould be avoided.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Such a truſt is very vain and unreaſonable.</hi> And it may appear to be ſo, by conſidering the weak and inſufficiency of all Means and Inſtruments reſpected as in themſelves, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the determining Counſel, &amp; over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence of God. <hi>It is not in man that walketh to direct his own ſteps, Jer. 10. 23.</hi> He is not able by all his contrivance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, by greateſt diligence and application to accompliſh what he deſigns or deſires: He cannot foreſee, and provide againſt fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture accidents, and therefore oftimes ruſheth into ruin when he thinks to chooſe for the beſt.

That the affairs of mankind, are managed and ordered, by a ſecret and powerful hand; ſometimes beſides, and ſometimes contrary to the intentions and expectations of thoſe, who are the principal actors, is moſt obſervable. How Inſtruments and means, are governed by Providence, and other iſſues produc'd, than the Nature and Connection of Second Cauſes do promiſe, was an obſervation made by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and recommended to the regard of all, in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>I returned, and ſaw under the Sun,

that the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wife, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor yet favour to men of ſkill; but time and chance hapneth to them all.</hi> How often are the moſt profound Politicks baffled?

The plots or projections that men have a long while labour'd in, are often unhing'd by an inviſible hand, when ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ripe for Execution: the Methods they take to raiſe themſelves are the things that lower and confound them.

The greateſt Revolutions in the World, have been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed with weak and inconſiderable Forces; the moſt numerous, and beſt provided Armies have been ſignally fruſtrated, and put to the rout.

very memorable Relations to this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. So many things may intercept, the moſt probable deſigns, ſo often are the Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and actions of men over-ruled unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Events, than were look'd for; ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties attend the courſe of War; that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and almoſt daily experience ſhews, how vain it is for any to truſt in their <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Bow;</hi> that thoſe who <hi>put on their Armour, ſhould not boaſt,</hi> themſelves, when doing of it. <hi>Vain is the help of man,</hi> Pſal. 108. 12. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vain is it, to truſt in man for help.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This Confidence is Sinful.</hi> The Evil hereof may be argued from the nature and tendency of it, as well as from the Reproofs in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that concern it. God himſelf, challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the truſt and dependence of mens Souls, and forbids the placing or exerciſing of it, upon other Objects: He is then own'd to be God, when means are uſed as ſubordinate to his determination, and Efficiency; but he is forſaken or diſown'd, when an Arm of fleſh is rely'd on; hence 'tis ſaid, <hi>Jer. 17. 5. Who truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his Arm, &amp; whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</hi> To truſt in the Creature, is derogatory to the Glory of the Creator, 'tis a denyal of God who is above, 'tis a reflection on his Majeſty, Soveraignty, and Greatneſs: to truſt in means when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, is to exalt them into the place and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001159_0020_0FB09110A68826A8"/>
ſtead of him, upon whom their Virtue and Efficacy intirely depends. Confidence in Arms and Forces prevents the due attendance on the Duty of Prayer, and other Religious exerciſes: theſe are wholly ſhut out, or but ſlightly, remiſsly, and formally attended where that prevails; and thus to do, is to contemn or renounce the divine favour. They do not <hi>Set their hearts aright, their ſpirits are not ſtedfaſt with God,</hi> they are inclined to follow indirect cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who are thus confident. God, by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> rebuked his People, for that, upon an invaſion of their Enemies, they were ſo intenſly concern'd to improve their own power &amp; wiſdom, in fortifying of themſelves, but neglected him the mean while, <hi>Iſa. 22. 8.—11. And thou didſt look in that day, to the Armour of the Houſe of the forreſt.—Ye made alſo a Ditch between the two Walls; but ye have not looked to the maker thereof, neither had reſpect to him that faſhioned it long ago.</hi> And they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſharply reproved, becauſe in their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſtrengthen themſelves againſt their Enemies, they <hi>did not take Counſel from God, nor aſk at his mouth,</hi> Iſa. 30. 1, 2. A truſt in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, is contrary to the Profeſſion of Gods People, and when truly penitent, they profeſt againſt it; <hi>Hos. 14. 3.

What a Series of troubles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters, was entail'd upon the Reign of <hi>Aſa,</hi> on this account! See 2 <hi>Chron. 16. 7, 9. Becauſe thou haſt not relyed on the Lord thy God, herein thou haſt done fooliſhly, therefore from henceforth thou ſhalt have Wars.</hi> Gods Honour engages him, to diſappoint the confidence of thoſe, who thus deſert him; and by giving their Enemies advantages againſt them; he lays matter of Conviction before them about, and conſtrains them to a ſenſe of their Error and Guilt. Such are left to take wrong ſteps or meaſures, to follow miſguided counſel, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come involved under further miſchiefs and calamities: their endeavours to extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their difficulties, do but further entangle and embroil them therein. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, having no ſure nor ſollid foundation for their truſt, they are at every puſh and

turn wavering in their Reſolutions, uncertain in all their paces or motions; they are fill'd with vexatious cares, fears and griefs under every ill Omen or aſpect; which naturally tend to their hurt or damage. God may rightly forſake thoſe, who in this reſpect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get their Duty, and tranſgreſs againſt him; and then their ſpirits will ſhrink up, their projects be carry'd head-long, all will go to wreck. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Dan. 10. 20.</hi> He is a <hi>God near at hand, and afar off alſo, Jer.</hi> 23. 23. He is the <hi>God of the Hills, and alſo of the Vallyes;</hi> and therefore he is in every place and ſtraight, at every juncture, under all emergencies a ſuitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for truſt. His Wiſdom is ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat all plots, and intriegues; oftimes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by unexpected means, in an unthought of, and ſurprizing manner, he delivers and ſaves his People. His power is ſufficient to ſuſtain and ſupport againſt all Oppoſitions, to reſcue from all dangers, and overturn all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary intereſts, <hi>2 Chron.</hi> 25. 8. <hi>He hath power to help, and alſo to caſt down.</hi> He is ſtiled the <hi>Rock,</hi> the <hi>Strength,</hi> the <hi>Keeper of Iſrael;</hi> He can <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand deliverance for Jacob,</hi> and his Word of Command will certainly effect it, when ever he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>By truſting in God his Glory is promoted and ſecured.</hi> God is jealous of his Glory, he will not allow that it ſhould be given to any other; and his People are obliged to be very tender of it. <hi>The Wiſe man muſt not glory in his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001159_0026_0FB0911FB0829C10"/>
the Mighty man in his Might, nor the Rich man in his Riches, but he that glorieth muſt glory in the Lord,</hi> Jer. 9. 23, 24. What men place their principal confidence in, that they Deify and Glorify: while therefore the People of God uſe means for their own ſafety againſt their Enemies, it concerns them in order to their glorifying of him, to be Exerciſing their truſt upon him. Two things may here be Suggeſted, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>The Divine Perfections, and the All-diſpoſing Providence of God are directly acknowledged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: the reſpect owing to him upon the account thereof is then yielded.</hi> 'Tis a very reaſonable, and comprehenſive injunction, <hi>Prov. 3. 6. In all thy ways acknowledge him.</hi> Becauſe God is the firſt Cauſe, the Supream Ruler and Moves of all Beings, and Affairs, becauſe <hi>His Eyes run to and fro throughout the Earth;</hi> and all wheels are exactly moved according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; even the moſt minute circumſtances &amp; incidences, fall under his cognizance and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, therefore a deference is due to him, in all undertakings, becauſe <hi>of and through him are all things,</hi> therefore ſhould <hi>all be for him, Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> But unleſs he is truſted in he is not duely acknowledged; the glory due to his Name is otherwiſe withheld: As to the Succeſs or iſſues of War, theſe are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly under his diſpoſal: He umpires and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001159_0027_0FB09120E3E894C8"/>
arbitrates in all Engagements; He is ſtiled the <hi>God of Armies,</hi> and his hand gives the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. He raiſeth the ſpirits of men, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirits them: He inclines them to proſperous methods, or infatuates their Counſels: He ſtrengthens or enfeebles them: and innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable are the ways, whereby he doth ſuch things. <hi>The Lord of Hoſts muſtreth the Hoſt of the Battel, Iſa.</hi> 13. 4 And when he pleaſeth to make an Army ſucceſsful, <hi>the Inhabitants ſhall be of ſmall power, greatly diſmayed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,</hi> advantages ſhall be hidden from them, and even their own amuſed minds, &amp; fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fancies ſhall precipitate them into diſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: <hi>the breaking of the Bow, the Shield, and the Battel</hi> are aſcribed unto God, <hi>at his Rebuke, both the Chariot and the Horſe are caſt into a dead ſleep,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now it is by truſting in God, that his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, Omnipotence, Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs are confeſt by his People; and his Government or influx as to all ſuch concomitants: hereby they acknowledge that he is their <hi>King and Saviour,</hi> that <hi>no Rock is like their Rock.</hi> Such an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment did King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> make, when he exerciſed his truſt in God, for protection from the Arms of proud <hi>Sennacherih,</hi> Iſa. 37. 16. <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, God of Iſrael, that dwelleth between the Cherubims, thou art the God, even thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001159_0028_0FB091226754D900"/>
of all the Kingdoms of the Earth, and haſt made Heaven and Earth.</hi> And ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was alſo made by King <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> when the Children of <hi>Moab, Ammon</hi> and <hi>Mount Seir</hi> were bandyed againſt him, and invaded him, <hi>2 Chron.</hi> 20. 6, 7, 12. Thus to be expreſſing a reſpect unto God in theſe their weighty affairs, are his people by vertue of their profeſſion indiſpenſably obliged.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hereby the Glory of God is ſecured for the future.</hi> Thoſe who are careful to truſt in God for Salvation, will be moſt ready to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer praiſe unto him, when Salvation is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: Where men place dependence, there they render homage when their deſigns are compaſſed, or their enterprizes ſpeed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their minds: <hi>they that truſt to their own Net and Dragg, will burn incenſe to theſe:</hi> but thoſe who truſt in the Lord, and commit their way to him, will bring their Spoils to his Altar: when their deſires are accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, they will readily ſay, as in, <hi>Pſal. 115. 1. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory:</hi> they will <hi>boaſt in God all the day long,</hi> as it is expreſt in our Context. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> who was an inſtance of a ſettled truſt in God, how full do we find him in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments unto God for all he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>Pſal, 18. 32, 33, 34. It is God that girdeth me with ſtrength, and maketh my way perfect;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001159_0029_0FB09123E1EB8090"/>
he maketh my feet like Hinds feet, and ſetteth me upon my high places; He teacheth my hands to War,</hi> &amp;c. Truſt in God is ever accompany'd with Humility; now the more humble any are, the more concern'd will they be to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe all praiſe unto God. Such Confeſſions are uttered by thoſe when delivered or proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, whoſe confidence hath been aright exerciſed, as we find in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 15. <hi>The Right hand of the Lord hath done valiantly?</hi> Pſa. 98. 1. <hi>His Right hand, and his holy Arm hath gotten him the victory.</hi> God will by no means allow his people to be puff'd up with ſucceſs, or to vaunt themſelves; hence it is ſaid, <hi>Jud.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Leſt Iſrael vaunt themſelves againſt me; ſaying, my own hand hath ſaved me:</hi> thoſe who aright truſt in God will be ſhy of this. And may I not add here, that ſuch will, when things appear doubtful, or go moſt croſs to their deſires, make a due conſtruction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and acknowledge his Name therein? When the People of God are careful in this regard, their Spirits are moulded to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive temper, unto a due acquieſcence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all Divine Diſpoſals.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This is the moſt ſucceſsful courſe.</hi> And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily it is to a right acknowledgment of God, the promiſe is made in the fore-mentioned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>He ſhall direct thy paths,</hi> or ſucceed and proſper thy undertakings.

               <p>I. <hi>A truſt rightly placed in God, will inſpire with true Fortitude and Magnanimity.</hi> 'Tis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally productive hereof.

               <p>We may from the premiſes infer, <hi>That thoſe who are truly and ſtrictly Religious, are beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for Service in a Military Station:</hi> I mean (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) their other Endowments of Body and Mind being equal. This Inference is natural and obvious, for ſuch, can aright exerciſe a truſt in God, and are diſpoſed to do it in all their Affairs. In the way of his

Commandments is God to be truſted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 166. <hi>Lord, I have hoped for thy Salvation, and done thy Commandments.</hi> Thoſe who are conſcientiouſly obſervant of approving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto God, by avoiding whatever is offenſive to him, and by diſcharging all the duties incumbent on them, may <hi>Encourage themſelves in the Lord,</hi> or be ſtedfaſtly truſting in him: and who ſo fit as theſe to ſtand in that Order wherein dangers are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and waited for? who ſo likely to be employed therein to advantage? <hi>The people that do know their God, ſhall be ſtrong and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,</hi> Dan. 11. 32. <hi>Now, they that know his Name do truſt in him</hi> As for thoſe who are at Enmity with Heaven, who are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affronting and defying the Great God, as profane and debauched perſons are, how can they truſt in him? or what reaſon have they to hope that he will ſtand by them? The boldneſs of ſuch is the effect of a ſenſeleſs or ſtupid ſpirit, of a deſperate phrenzy? they may at ſometimes brave it out in the face of Death, but it is becauſe they are not aware, or don't bethink themſelves of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents thereof: let the Conſciences of ſuch be but alarm'd and rouz'd, their Reſolutions will ſuddenly cool, and their Spirits recoil, the terrors of the Lord will make them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, they will tremble at the tidings and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches

of their Enemies, as of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of Divine Revenges. Surely then, they are beſt fitted to <hi>ſpeak with the Enemy in the Gate,</hi> whoſe Reverence of God, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful behaviour towards him, incourages and warrants their truſt in him. True Piety is a main qualification for good Souldiery; it not only graces or beautifies thoſe who make profeſſion thereof, but will render them more uſeful and ſucceſsful in their ſeveral Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The more devout, the better Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; ſuch only who are truly Religious, can value a good Cauſe, they are moſt likely to approve themſelves faithful &amp; ſteady in their reſpective Charges, and the Courage of ſuch is owing to ſure and unſhaken principles. <hi>The profeſſion of Souldiers, and the profeſſion of Chriſtianity are ſo far from being at odds, that nothing more accompliſheth for the former, than ſuch a belief of Chriſtian Principles as doth produce an agreeable practice.</hi>

and verily, it concerns a people in general, for the Service of whom Military Forces are levyed &amp; employed, to be thus alſo approving themſelves. What can expert and valiant Warriours do in behalf of a people, whom God is in Honour engaged to contend with, and bring low? Naked and Defenceleſs are they, from whom God is departed, although their Borders ſhould be lined and covered with the moſt valourous Souldiers. If God will puniſh his <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a few <hi>wounded &amp; feeble Chaldeans</hi> ſhall be too many and too ſtrong for them; but if he will protect it, <hi>huge Hoſts</hi> ſhall inſtantly be Diſcomfited and Scattered.

and turning from what hath been matter of provocation to him; and thus be in good earneſt, ſeeking Reconciliation with him: then may we get him engaged for us who is the <hi>God of Armies,</hi> then may we truſt that our Arms ſhall be proſpered, that our <hi>Bow</hi> and our <hi>Sword ſhould not return empty.</hi> Were we a Righteous and Holy People, we might boaſt in God, be confident that his Face would be towards us, and his Arm employed for us; if we <hi>hearken to him, and walk in his ways,</hi> we might allot upon it, <hi>that he would ſoon ſubdue our enemies, and turn his hand againſt our Adverſaries, Pſal.</hi> 81. 13, 14 But if <hi>his Holy Mountain is forſaken, if his Covenant is neglected,</hi> if we are falſe, deceitful, and unſteady in our dealings with him, we muſt juſtify God <hi>tho' he caſt us off, and put us to ſhame, and go not forth with our Armies, and ſuffer thoſe that hate us to ſpoil for themſelves.</hi> When <hi>Iſrael</hi> turns their backs, and fall before their Enemies, we are told the cauſe in, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 13. <hi>There is an accurſed thing in the midſt of thee, O Iſrael;</hi> Wou'd we make God our truſt, and enjoy his Salvation, we muſt ſearch out the <hi>accurſed thing,</hi> we muſt amend our ways and our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

               <p>We are hence inſtructed, <hi>With what deſign and frame of ſpirit, Military Skill is to be ſought, and Military Preparations to be made.</hi> Theſe are to be conſidered as means under God of the publick ſafety, and accordingly to be purſued; but an intire Reſignation ſhould be made to him, and a due truſt exerciſed in him as to the ſucceſs thereof.</p>
               <p>'Tis very commendable to be ſeeking after skill in Military Science or Faculty, and the attainment thereof is a valuable Talent. However this is from God, and is his Gift; yet it is not to be expected from him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, but by his bleſſing upon the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſe of proper means. <hi>Abraham</hi> took care that his Houſhold Servants ſhould be tutored to the uſe of Warlike Weapons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 14. When <hi>David</hi> aſſum'd the Government upon <hi>Sauls</hi> Defeat &amp; Death, one of the principal things, wherein he manifeſted his care of the Common-wealth, was that, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>He bade them teach the Children of Judah the uſe of the Bow.</hi> There is an honourable mention made of ſuch in the Scripture Record, who
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001159_0038_0FB0913BF66C2CB8"/>
were <hi>ſkilful is War, able to bear Sword and Buckler, and to ſhoot with Bows,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. 18. And in ch. 12. 18. <hi>Men of War fitted for the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, who could handle Shield and Buckler.</hi> They may well be accounted ſome of the moſt uſeful perſons in a Common-wealth, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in ſuch like ſkill and endowments, and who are promoters thereof. What will Stores and Magazines ſignify, without men of Skill and Spirit to apply and manage them? But to ſeek after Military Accompliſhments only as an Ornament, or piece of Gallantry, is vain: and yet leſs juſtifyable is it, to attend Military Exerciſes as a ſport or piece of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: if due references are not made herein, that time expended about them is but loſt. <hi>It is acceptable to God, when proficiency in the Art Military is endeavoured, with a deſign of Service to him and his Church;</hi> thoſe who don't thus regard it, do but trifle in their pretences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
               <p>All due Preparations both to withſtand &amp; offend an Enemy, are proper &amp; incumbent, eſpecially in times of danger. 'Tis inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable folly to be negligent in this regard, for indeed none can aright truſt in God, who are ſlack as to the uſe of means ordained and afforded. Perſons of a Military Order and Spirit, are therefore to be encouraged; thoſe who bear Arms for the Service of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:001159_0039_0FB0913ECCE71DA8"/>
ſhould be well provided for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded: all needful Supplies of every kind procured and in a readineſs: but whatever care is uſed in theſe things, it muſt be with an eye to God, reſigning and commending all to his bleſſing. In <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> time, when a ſudden Onſet was expected, from thoſe who were malignant againſt the intereſts of the People, and of the Worſhip of God, we have an account of his exemplary method, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>I ſet the people after their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, with their Swords, their Spears, and their Bows: and ſaid to the Nobles, to the Rulers, and unto the reſt of the People, be not ye afraid: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the Lord which is Great and Terrible, &amp; fight for your Brethren, your Sons &amp; your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, your Wives, and your Houſes.</hi> The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Religion of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and victorious Adverſary was approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we find record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 1—8. So then when the <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Sword</hi> are prepared, when ſkill or dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity for the due improvement of theſe is endeavoured after, a Service for God and his People ſhould be intended; but moreover there ſhould be a reſt, relyance or depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon God, in order thereto.</p>
               <p>All I ſhall here add is this, that it is juſtly to be accounted a mark of Divine Deſertion, when there is a general failure among a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:001159_0040_0FB0913FA6BF8288"/>

                  <hi>This Reſpect unto God or truſt in him, in all our endeavours for ſafety, under our preſent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is now to be Recommended.</hi> If we believe a Providence, we can't but acknowledge that this is incumbent; as we would not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our Duty to God, nor incur his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as we would not be blaſted in our undertakings, but obtain an Expected end, we muſt practice accordingly.</p>
               <p>The tendency hereof, is not to nouriſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, but to take off from a falſe, fooliſh, and dangerous confidence. There is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between neglecting and not confiding in means. To be carefully uſing of them, and yet to conſider or regard 'em in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, is a point of great concernment, and not a little caution is needful hereunto. There are two Extreams, and there is danger
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:001159_0041_0FB0914122164D98"/>
on either ſide, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> Truſting in means while neglecting of God, and truſting in God while neglecting or careleſs of means. We are eſpecially incident to the former, in what concerns outward or ſecular matters; and therefore it is, that if at any time our Endeavours are crowned with ſucceſs, we are ready to allot upon it for the future, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of God, and our dependence on him: but if our Enterprizes miſcarry, we are ready to droop or deſpond, as if no help could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: there is therefore abundant reaſon why the Duty propounded ſhould be preſt, and urged upon us. For which End, both former Experiences, and our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, may juſtly be reflected and deliberated upon by us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That it is beneficial for us to truſt in God, hath been formerly experienced; and therefore are we Obliged ſtill to be truſting in his Name.</hi> By a Chain of Memorable Providences hath the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour been manifeſted in the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Eſtabliſhment of our Civil and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Liberties, notwithſtanding the Malice, and Moleſtation, whereto we have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious. <hi>Many a time may this Iſrael ſay, if it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, then they had ſwallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us.</hi> The uſe of our <hi>Sword</hi> and <hi>Bow,</hi> hath been
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:001159_0042_0FB09147A3F56608"/>
ſeveral times called for, and by a truſt in God rendered ſuccesful. The former works of God, ſhould be improved unto the <hi>Setling our Hope in him,</hi> Pſal. 78. 4, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our preſent Circumſtances proclaim, how <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">

                     </gap> is to truſt in our Bow and Sword for Salvation.</hi> Very awful and tragicall are the things, that by Divine permiſſion have been acted in our Land, by a Contemptible and Barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and very Remarkable <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> have attended our Enterprizes, when formed with the beſt care and caution, when purſued with the greateſt Labour and Diligence. We have had abundant conviction, of the inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficancy of Military ſkill and proweſs in our actions againſt an inſidious Enemy: <hi>That vain is the help of Man without the help of God, hath been very ſenſibly proclaim'd unto us:</hi> In that our Confidences have been ſo much rejected, our Succeſſive &amp; Expenſive Expeditions, ſo much blaſted, we ſhould be Cautious where we put our truſt, it highly concerns us to be ſo. God deſigns to make us throughly ſenſible, of our abſolute dependence upon himſelf, that we are hopeleſs unleſs he undertake for us. The apprehenſions of our weakneſs and danger at preſent, ſhould cauſe us to be more in Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upward; to be acting more agreeably to the Profeſſion we make in our Solemn Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, unto God for his guidance and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:001159_0043_0FB0914966EDAED8"/>
bleſſing in all our great affairs; far better would it be with us, did we more Eye God in all; if though a <hi>Poor and afflicted People, we truſt in his Name,</hi> we ſhould enjoy his defence, he would ariſe and Save us.</p>
               <p>IT Remains, that I now direct my ſelf to the Honourable Company, who have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me in their Service at this time.</p>
               <p>Gentlemen, The truth preſented to your Conſideration, is not improper upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch occaſions as this day are attended by you, but at the preſent juncture, under the Rebukes we at preſent Labour and Languiſh, it is, what peculiarly requires your thoughts. I preſume that what hath been offered is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to your own Sentiments, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires you have Expreſt to have a Bleſſing ask'd from Heaven upon your Eſſays; and I am ſure your Learning and Practiſing the Leſſon you have heard is of great behoofe. Truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God is a Duty, you are to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of, in every Capacity, and it greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you in that Capacity wherein this day you appear: it ſuppoſes, and hath a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry connection with all other Duties thereto belonging, or incumbent therein.</p>
               <p>The ſubject handled, hath not the leaſt tendency, to divert or diſcourage you from your laudable AEmulation, of high degrees in
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:001159_0044_0FB0914AE2CB4D88"/>
Military accompliſhments; but it tends to further you in ſuch an uſe of your Arms, in Exerciſing and Employing them with ſuch a deſign and diſpoſition, as may render you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God, and the happy inſtruments in his hand of good unto his People.</p>
               <p>If the drift and tendency of my Diſcourſe, hath principally referr'd unto what concerns Souldiers, when call'd forth to real Service, in faceing and encountring of their Enemies; the conſideration of the State of Affairs abroad in the World, and among our ſelves, may, (I Suppoſe) be a ſufficient Apology for it. A General Summons to War, ſeems to be now Serv'd among the Nations, and an hot Service are they like to be called unto, who can bear Arms. <hi>To the help of the Lord againſt the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> all who would be accounted Cordial to the Weal of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> may be glad to appear; as for thoſe who refuſe to afford their Help in ſuch a Criſis, the bitter <hi>Curſe of Meroz</hi> is like to take place upon them. The tidings brought us from abroad may cauſe us to reflect on thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 46. 10. <hi>For this is the day of the Lord God of Hoſts, a day of Vengeance; the Sword ſhall devour and be ſatiate, it ſhall be made drunk with blood.</hi> And when are we like to ſee a Period of our Calamities and Diſaſters? Verily, as yet a <hi>Sound of Battel is in the Land, and of great Deſtruction;</hi> to uſe
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001159_0045_0FB0914C61D1EDB0"/>
the Words of the ſame Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 22. Ruins and Deſolations have been in our Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; Garments rolled in Blood, the confuſed noiſe of inſulting Enemies, mingled, with the groans of the Wounded, and Wailings of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, have been there ſeen and heard. And we have ground for very ſolemn and awful apprehenſions, as to what may be behind, of being further and more grievouſly affected with the Wars of <hi>Europe,</hi> before the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them. If ever learning War was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, now it is; and now if ever, ſhould thoſe who attend Preparatory Exerciſes for learning of it, have very cloſe thoughts about, and a ſerious regard to Real Service; and a Truſt in God is now Eminently called for.</p>
               <p>Be Excited then, to a proceedure in your Endeavours after further attainments in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary ſkill, and accompliſhments for Military Work and Service. Let Conſcience of Duty influence your performances on ſuch days as this is; and conſider that you muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God in Seeking, what you deſire and reach after; it is he can <hi>Teach your hands to War, and your fingers to Fight.</hi> Labour after the Exerciſe of a right hope and truſt in God, as to all you are, or may be called unto; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire your ſelves to it: watchfully avoid what is inconſiſtent with it: Let the requiſites here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto be carefully purſued, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> A right know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:001159_0046_0FB091504C1AA200"/>
of God, and an hearty ſubjection to his Will. And let the intereſt of CHRIST ever lye near your hearts: if Heathens could act from ſuch a principle, that <hi>it would not be worth their Living to ſee the Deſtruction of their Country and of their Religion;</hi> ſurely Chriſtians, may and ſhould be much rather ſwayed thereby. Eſteem it truly glorious, and worthy of your Ambition, to be Inſtruments under God of his Peoples ſafety, or of preſerving, reſtoring, prolonging their tranquility.</p>
               <p>I ſhall have done when I have ſaid, that there is a <hi>Spiritual Warfare,</hi> whereto all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are Obliged, and it is moſt pernicious or dangerous to be <hi>Self-Confident</hi> in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof. We muſt all yield our ſelves to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to fight under his <hi>Banner,</hi> and to be followers of him, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he ſhall call us: We muſt ſee that we want none of the <hi>Armour</hi> he hath provided for us, and in his Word recommended to us: We muſt <hi>Watch always; Fight and not flouriſh</hi> onely: the <hi>World</hi> muſt not be inordinately either loved or feared by us, but overcome: <hi>Sin,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling Sin muſt be not only Maimed; Wounded, or Suppreſt, but Mortified; <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, Powers and Spiritual Wickedneſſes,</hi> muſt be wreſtled with and Vanquiſhed. But how ſhall we do this? We are told how, in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:001159_0047_0FB091532AC53BE8"/>
his might.</hi> Our truſt, the truſt of our Souls, muſt be placed and fixed on our Glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: to Him we muſt repair, in his Name engage, elſe we ſhall be Foiled, Worſted, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved; but obſerving his <hi>Orders,</hi> and relying on his <hi>Grace,</hi> we ſhall come off <hi>more than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours. To ſit down with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his Throne,</hi> is verily ſuch a Triumph, that the Tongues of Men and Angels, cannot Expreſs the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
