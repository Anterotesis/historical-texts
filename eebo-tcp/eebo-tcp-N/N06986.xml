            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap>I.32. HE THAT IS SLOW TO ANGER, IS BETTER THAN THE MIGHTY: AND HE THAT RULETH HIS SPIRIT, THAN HE THAT TAKETH A CITY.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE author of theſe proverbs appears to have been greatly acquainted with men, and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudied in civil policy. He knew the ſprings of action in the human mind, and how to touch them in the moſt delicate manner. He poſſeſs'd in a ſuperior degree, "the wiſdom from above, which is pure and peaceable." In anſwer to his judicious prayer God gave him "a wiſe and underſtanding heart." Some valuable fruits of his wiſdom may be gathered by us, if we
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008878_0004_10309C4F280F62E8"/>
duly attend to his important maxims, and the excellent rules for the government of our hearts and lives, which are ſcattered thro' his writings. In them vulgar errors are corrected; falſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is diſcovered; and the way to true honor and happineſs marked out.</p>
            <p>THE verſe, which is to be the foundation of our preſent diſcourſe, teaches us to judge properly of actions and characters; inſtructs us not to be dazzled with thoſe that wear the falſe glitter of heroiſm and magnanimity, while we overlook thoſe that are truly noble and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, in "the judgment which is according to truth." <hi>He that is ſlow to anger, is better than the mighty: and he that ruleth his ſpirit, than he that taketh a city.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN diſcourſing from theſe words, I ſhall endeavour—To open and explain the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which we find in them,—To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them together, that we may ſee how much preferable the one is to the other—And— To animate all to purſue them with a zeal proportionate to their reſpective importance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:008878_0005_10309C520ACF3640"/>IN ſpeaking of theſe points, ſome things may be ſaid not altogether foreign to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>THE explanation of the characters in our text is firſt to be attempted.</p>
            <p>TO be <hi>ſlow to anger,</hi> and to <hi>rule the ſpirit,</hi> I take to be parts of the ſame character; tho' not deſcriptive of preciſely the ſame temper. <hi>The former</hi> may refer, partly at leaſt, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural make and frame of the mind, as having leſs warmth and fire, leſs propenſity to wrath and paſſion, than is frequently found in ſome. That there is ſuch a difference obſervable in perſons, before education or religion have had any influence upon them, I ſuppoſe will not be diſputed. An enquiry into the reaſons of this difference, is beſide my preſent purpoſe. <hi>The latter,</hi> namely, <hi>to rule the ſpirit,</hi> may point out a mind, bro't under the government of religion and the word of God, by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mighty reaſon and almighty grace, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the original conſtitution might be.</p>
            <p>THE man who deſerves the character of one that rules his ſpirit, I take to be neceſſarily
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008878_0006_10309C54EA8D6EC0"/>
a man of religion; who is "renewed in the ſpirit of his mind, after the image of him that created him"; who has the fear of God ruling in his heart; who acts from the noble principles of piety and goodneſs; who is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, in all his conduct, by a ſacred regard to the Deity. The man that acts up to this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, has put on Chriſt, and poſſeſt himſelf of the genius of his goſpel. The inferior powers of the mind, ſo apt to rebel, are brought under the influence of reaſon and religion, which ought to bear rule. Reaſon, whoſe influence is ſo weak in the lives of many, in him reaſſumes her rightful authority, and gains obedience to her laws. And reaſon herein acts like herſelf, in not building too great dependance on her own native ſtrength and vigor; but thankfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the aſſiſtance of divine revelation; "makes the word of God the man of her counſel at all times"; and freely ſubmits to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof.</p>
            <p>SUCH principles, deeply wrought into the heart by ſanctifying grace, will enable a man properly to rule his ſpirit; and nothing ſhort hereof will be effectual to do it, to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable degree. Indeed the more extravagant
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008878_0007_10309C57F68B1E98"/>
actings of a turbulent ſpirit, and the more dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of pride and paſſion, cruelty and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, may be generally ſuppreſſed by lower motives; ſuch as a regard to decency, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation among men of ſober minds; and a fear of penal laws. But tho' theſe external reſtraints may ſerve thus far, yet the reſtleſs ſpirit, prevented from its natural exertion upon others, will prey upon the man himſelf, and produce ſtrange miſery and confuſion in his breaſt: and if theſe feebler reſtraints were taken off, paſſion and anger would be, like the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of waters, fierce and impetuous, and deal deſtruction all around.</p>
            <p>THE man who duly rules his ſpirit, has a full belief and abiding ſenſe, of the moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of God; and that himſelf is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this government. His own will he knows ought to be ruled by the divine pleaſure; and his conduct by the divine laws. And what he knows to be right he deſires ſhould take place upon him: accordingly he endeavours his ſpirit ſhould be entirely "in ſubjection to the father of ſpirits". This view of things has a powerful influence to keep his mind calm and ſerene under all circumſtances of life; and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008878_0008_10309C5B09D3BF40"/>
amidſt the various aſpects of providence. Like <hi>St. Paul,</hi>
               <q>he knows both how to be abaſed, and how to abound; and learns, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtate he is, therewith to be content.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I MEAN not to intimate, that the ſpirit of ſuch an one loſes its activity and ſprightlineſs; and becomes dull and unperforming. Far from this,—he has life and zeal to purſue every article of known duty: not a blind ill-guided zeal, which leads him headlong; but that which is according to knowledge. He has courage and reſolution enough to enterpriſe great things; and a greatneſs of ſoul which gives him ſerenity in the event, whatever it be. He does not run mad with pride when his wiſhes ſucceed; nor deſpond when his hopes are blaſted. Joy and ſorrow, hope and fear, do not put him out of poſſeſſion of his own mind; but prove proper ſprings of action, as they were deſigned to be; and he learns "in patience to poſſeſs his ſoul".</p>
            <p>WHEN the God of providence ſmiles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and cauſes his goodneſs to paſs before him, he does not wax wanton, and riot in the kindneſſes of his heavenly father; but uſes
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008878_0009_10309C5DE7E1CB08"/>
them with ſobriety and moderation; and feels the generous flame of gratitude kindle in his breaſt towards him "from whom comes down every good and every perfect gift." When ſorrows and afflictions, heavy and numerous, overtake him, and many of his deareſt outward enjoyments are taken away, he calmly ſubmits to the will of heaven; and learns meekly to ſay, as an afflicted ſervant of God once did, "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, and bleſſed be the name of the Lord. None of theſe things greatly move him; his heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord."</p>
            <p>MUCH the ſame compoſure of mind accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies him thro' the trials which he meets with more immediately from the hands of his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Kindneſs and benevolence are the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual temper of his mind towards thoſe who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and injure him. In one inſtance he ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently pities them under the power of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed paſſions, and is grieved to ſee them indulging to malevolence and ill-will; and thô in another he may manifeſt reſentment, he does ſo only when reſentment is agreeable to reaſon and the goſpel; and likely to advance the good of thoſe that abuſe him. The calm exerciſe of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008878_0010_10309C60C59031C0"/>
reaſon ſtraitens or relaxes the reins of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and he learns what is very difficult, "to be angry and not ſin." Such is the man who is <hi>ſlow to anger, and rules his ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE other character in our text comes next under our conſideration. <hi>The mighty—he that taketh a city.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE words point out a man of ſtrength and vigor, able to bear the fatigues of war, and ready to face the dangers of battle; one whoſe conſtitution is ſtrong, and his fibres braced; one who has ſucceeded in military attempts, has been victorious in warfare, and borne a part in the conqueſt of a defenced city. To raiſe the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſtill higher, let us ſuppoſe him to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief in ſome important expedition. Let us conſider him as enduring the hardſhips, and bidding defiance to the dangers of the campaign, as vigorouſly purſuing the plan of operation, 'til he has led his forces into the ſtrong city, and victory crowns his endeavours.</p>
            <p>THESE things ſet a man in a diſtinguiſhed point of light, and draw a train of admirers. The vanquiſhed fear and tremble; the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008878_0011_10309C63A66CCAC0"/>
multitude ſhout applauſe. This character at leaſt appears reſpectable; and really is ſo, when there is nothing to detract from the honor and uſefulneſs of it; thô indeed ſuch things may be found in a man whoſe conduct is not agreable to heaven, and who is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to true felicity. The principles of action muſt be taken into the account, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the character truly good, or not ſo. Who, that is inſpired with a generous love to mankind, can think with pleaſure and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation on a <hi>Pompey,</hi> a <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or an <hi>Alexander,</hi> who were mighty men, ſubdued people and cities not a few, and marked their ſteps in blood while they traverſed the world! A man migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in war, who is a ſtranger to humanity and the gentle ſpirit of the goſpel, may force trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling crowds to yield a feigned ſubmiſſion; to "bow down their necks that he may go over;" but will never be a public bleſſing, nor enjoy ſincere love and eſteem.</p>
            <p>BUT each of theſe characters will be ſet in a clearer light by comparing them together, as we propoſed in the ſecond place. This will diſcover him that is "ſlow to anger and rules his ſpirit, to be better than the mighty and he that taketh a city."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:008878_0012_10309C66890DF288"/>THE preference muſt be given to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as the difficulty of gaining the rule of our ſpirits is greater than that of obtaining a mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conqueſt.</p>
            <p>HOW hard is it to ſuppreſs the rebellion of corrupt luſts and affections, and to bring them into obedience to the laws of Chriſt! How hard to huſh angry and tumultuous paſſions, when we meet the provoking language, or the more provoking actions of our fellow-mortals; and according to the ſpirit of the goſpel, "to ſhew all meekneſs to all men, and overcome evil with good!" How difficult to maintain a ſpirit calm and ſerene, under loſſes, and croſſes, and grievous diſappointments! Do we not find, in this caſe, "a law in our members waring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of our minds;" and an evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit counter-working the good? What hard ſtruggles! What ſevere conflicts! What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant watchings! What earneſt ſupplications are neceſſary, before we gain the rule of our own ſpirits, ſo as to paſs unruffled thrô the ſhifting ſcenes of life! We, in this ſpiritual warfare, "wreſtle not only with fleſh and blood, but with principalities and powers, and ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places;" which abet the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008878_0013_10309C6962645240"/>
corrupt motions of the mind, in oppoſition to the nobler principles of ſubſtantial goodneſs. To ſucceed therefore in this ſpiritual conflict, more vigorous exertions, as well as more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful aſſiſtances from above, are neceſſary, than to meet an enemy in the gate, to ſcale the walls of a city, or to ſubject the numerous inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof.</p>
            <p>AGAIN,—Much greater is the happineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the former, than the latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, even in this world.</p>
            <p>THE former prepares a man to paſs ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrô the rougher paſſages of life, and gives tranquility of mind in the moſt preſſing emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies. View ſuch an one in proſperity, and a ſoul healthful and proſperous, doubles every comfort; and renders the good things of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providence bleſſings indeed. View him in adverſity, "his mind is fixed, truſting in the Lord: He is like Mount Sion, which cannot be removed, but abideth forever." He has that "peace which paſſes all underſtanding," and drinks deeply of the comforts of religion. Theſe produce a noble firmneſs of mind, in the midſt of the ſtorms and tempeſts of this evil
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008878_0014_10309C6C3A7FD868"/>
world. "Tho' the rain deſcends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon him," he remains unſhaken. Tho' in the partial judgment of ſome, his comforts may be ſmall, yet it is to be remembred, that thoſe joys, like thoſe rivers, are often the deepeſt, and the moſt laſting, which run on in a ſilent ſtream, without noiſe and tumult.</p>
            <p>THE greateſt conqueror, whoſe ſpirit is not formed to ſuch a religious firmneſs, by the energy of divine grace, and the long and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate practice of virtue, muſt be a ſtranger to ſuch exalted happineſs. The ſubmiſſion of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,—the applauſe of the populace,—the glittering ornaments of military dreſs,—and the laurels of victory, may all accompany one, whoſe mind is full of anxiety, confuſion and guilt.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER,—The man that has obtained a victory over his own ſpirit, is fitted for more extenſive uſefulneſs than he could be without it. This, far from diſqualifying him for any ſtation and employment in life, ſerves to make him more fit for every one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:008878_0015_10309C6F1A2C0ED8"/>VIEW him in low life,—His mind is not ſwelled with boundleſs ambition, nor does a reſtleſs ſpirit urge him on, at all adventures, and by any meaſures, lawful or unlawful, to ſeek a higher ſphere of action: but his mind is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily accommodated to his circumſtances; he is willing "to abide in the calling, wherein he is called of God;" and deſirous to fill with honor that ſtation in which providence has placed him, how low ſoever it be; ſenſible that in the civil, as well as in the natural body, ſome members are appointed to higher, and ſome to lower offices.</p>
            <p>VIEW him as a magiſtrate,—He, like the author of our religion, whoſe ſpirit dwells with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, will rule the people in meekneſs, and judge in equity. His gentleneſs will melt thoſe, whom rigour could not ſubdue. The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ruler, accompanied with the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the chriſtian, will force a willing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from all; and inſenſibly learn the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious the language of obedience; "what wilt thou have me to do?" In conſequence of inward ſerenity, "a law of kindneſs will dwell upon his lips;" which will often have a more powerful influence upon the ſtubborn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008878_0016_10309C71F7182FE0"/>
than the greateſt ſeverities of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and give occaſion to ſay; "how forcible are right words?" The magiſtrate will be feared;—the man will be loved; — order will be maintained; and civil government made to anſwer the excellent ends for which it is deſigned. Such rulers will be likely "to rule for God, and be faithful; they will be a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to evil doers, and a praiſe to them that do well."</p>
            <p>'TIS in vain to expect theſe happy effects from the adminiſtrations of thoſe, who are ſlaves to their paſſions, and attempt to rule the ſpirits of others, without ruling their own. The reins of government will be held with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady hand; relaxed too much, or too much ſtraitned. The petulance of the man, will counteract the influence of the magiſtrate; by which means authority will ſink, and law be trodden under foot. His obſervation muſt have been very much confined, and his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of human nature very ſmall, who is not convinced that this repreſentation is juſt.</p>
            <p>VIEW the man alſo that rules his ſpirit by the laws of Chriſt, acting in a military charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008878_0017_10309C739F497DB0"/>
—How great an addition will this be to his honor and uſefulneſs! Hereby the officer will learn to command with meekneſs of wiſdom; and the private to obey, "not by conſtraint, but willingly." Hereby an inviolable union of hearts will be promoted. The commander will not be baſely deſerted in time of danger; nor the troops wantonly ſold to deſtruction; but each will be careful to keep his ſtation, and every one reſolved to do his duty. What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may we not expect to ſee performed by ſuch forces as theſe!</p>
            <p>THEY greatly miſtake, who imagine men neceſſarily enervated and rendered effeminate, by having their ſpirits ruled by the gentle laws of religion, ſo as to be leſs diſpoſed to engage in the military ſervice, when properly invited thereto by providence; or leſs likely to act up to the character of valiant ſoldiers.—Far from this:— None have ſo tender a concern for their country; none will be more ready to exert themſelves for the public good; none can face dangers with ſo much fortitude of mind; none can view ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and death ſpread before them, in all its gloomy horrors, with ſo rational a courage, with ſuch an elevation of ſoul, as they whoſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008878_0018_10309C7902444E98"/>
ſpirits are greatly chriſtian; and whoſe hopes of happineſs beyond the grave, are rendered ſtrong and bright, by a long and intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the power of religion. The confidence of ſuch is reaſon, not madneſs. They act from principles which can't be annihilated thrô the ſudden aſſaults of fear, or baſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to deſertion: ſuch as a regard to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of God, the intereſt of religion, and the preſervation of our civil rights. Such are "mighty thrô God for the pulling down the ſtrong holds of their enemies: they go forth in the name and ſtrength of the Lord of hoſts, and thrô him do valiantly." Though they are diveſted of the reſtleſs paſſions and fury of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified minds, yet none have their ſpirits more fired with zeal and vigor than they, when the ſervice of God and their country invite them to action.</p>
            <p>BUT then their magnanimity and zeal exert themſelves, not to gratify revenge, not to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply the ſlain, or to triumph in the miſeries of men; but to eſtabliſh the cauſe of truth and juſtice between contending powers. They don't put off humanity in the field; nor borrow the ſpirit of him, who, "like a roring lion,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008878_0019_10309C7AA76A0EB0"/>
goes about ſeeking whom he may devour." The occaſion for war gives them pain; they fight for peace. And it is evident that wars will be leſs frequent, or ceaſe, in proportion to the prevalence of a ſpirit of ſelf-government, which is the ſpirit of the goſpel. When every one, from the monarch to the peaſant, ſhall <hi>be ſlow to anger, and rule his ſpirit,</hi> "wars ſhall ceaſe to the ends of the earth: Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more." This is evident from the demand of the apoſtle;— "whence come wars and fightings among you? Come they not hence, even of your luſts, which war in your members?" But we may not expect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of this ſpirit will be ſo great, as to cloſe the tragical ſcenes of war, under the preſent diſpenſation. Chriſt "came not to ſend peace on earth, but a ſword." But, "when he ſhall come a ſecond time, he will remove from them that are his, every thing that offends," and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them in uninterrupted peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE,—They who bring their ſpirits under the government of reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, gain thereby a greater intereſt in the love
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008878_0020_10309C7C8DB9FE08"/>
and eſteem of men than can be obtained by military power and ſucceſs, while the ſpirit remains lawleſs and ungoverned.</p>
            <p>THE mighty man, whoſe mind is cruel and ſavage, who "continually breaths out threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and ſlaughter," thô he ſhould be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in war, thô he ſhould depopulate cities and countries, and go on from conquering to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, is ſtill an object upon which every man of humanity and religion thinks with horror: He is feared by many, loved by none. Not ſo the man, whoſe every tho't, and every paſſion, is captivated to the obedience of Chriſt: a diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive benevolence to all mankind poſſeſſes his heart; and he learns to obey that difficult command of our Saviour, "Love your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies." Such a ſpirit gives him a place in the warmeſt affections of all.</p>
            <p>WAS it not this ſpirit appearing in our late gracious Sovereign, which gave him ſo firm a poſſeſſion of the hearts of all his ſubjects, while he lived, and which renders his memory ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to them, ſince his removal? The nations have riſen up with one voice to call him bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and open and ſolemn reſpects have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008878_0021_10309C81D9D13120"/>
paid to his memory. Yet upon this return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing public occaſion, you will allow me to ſay;— that among his many royal accompliſhments, the humanity and gentleneſs of ſpirit which he appeared poſſeſſed of, were none of the leaſt; the natural conſequence of which was a mild and ſteady adminiſtration. Thô he manifeſted a ſurpriſing firmneſs of mind, in his cloſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to, and vigorous ſupport of the preſent war; and that at a time when his flow of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits might be ſuppoſed greatly abated, by the infirmities of age; yet ſo ſuſceptible was his heart of the ſofter paſſions, that he always prefered peace to war, when it could be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon terms honorable to his crown. A ſtriking proof of this he gave in the overtures of peace which he made to his old perfidious enemies the <hi>French;</hi> at a time when ſucceſs attended all his military enterprizes; at a time when his enemies were extremely reduced; and at a time, when an ungenerous monarch would have thought it a fair opportunity to gratify a revengeful temper, by ſcornfully rejecting the moſt equitable propoſals for an accommodation. The happy effects of this gentle ſpirit have ſpread far and wide. They have been ſenſibly felt, and gratefully acknowledged, by his moſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008878_0022_10309C83804025E0"/>
dutiful ſubjects in theſe American colonies.— While we ſpeak of this, to do honor to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, we neceſſarily renew our grief for the very great loſs we have ſuſtained by his death.— But perhaps it may be tho't unſeaſonable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to ſorrow in any great degree, ſince thro' the goodneſs of God, this loſs is ſo happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and our joy takes place of our mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the acceſſion of our preſent gracious ſovereign, King GEORGE the THIRD, to the Britiſh throne; who ſhares ſo largely in the excellent ſpirit of his royal predeceſſor; and who is formed, we hope, by ſo great an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and by the grace of God, to ſuch a temper, as will render him a diſtinguiſhed bleſſing to the kingdoms, at the head of which he is placed.</p>
            <p>NOR does this mildneſs of diſpoſition ſerve only to raiſe crowned heads high in the eſteem of their ſubjects; thoſe that act in a lower ſphere, enjoy the affections of their fellow-men, in proportion to the degree in which they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it. Is it not this, in connection with other valuable endowments, that fills our hearts with the warmeſt ſentiments of love to the illuſtrious <hi>Amherſt?</hi> He, far removed from the cruelty of
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008878_0023_10309C85301BF6B8"/>
the tyrant, feels the influence of humanity and religion on his mind: his actions breath the ſpirit of the goſpel, and he is "mighty to ſave," as well as mighty to deſtroy. His cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, ſtruck with the unexpected clemency and tenderneſs of their conqueror, forget the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of a captivated ſtate, and fool in their breaſts the delightful ſenſations of love and gratitude to their gentle maſter. Who does not love, who does not admire, thoſe that manifeſt ſuch a ſpirit! "Their names," like that of their divine maſter, "are as ointment poured forth."—He, who is poſſeſſed of ſuch a ſpirit, will ſecure more laſting honor, than he, who deſtitute hereof, can boaſt great martial exploits. The moſt that will be ſaid of the one, in a little time, will probably be, that ſomebody cruelly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered ſomebody; while the actions of the other, will be carefully treaſured up in the minds of many, and mentioned to his honor from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation.</p>
            <p>BESIDES,—If we view them when they draw near to the cloſe of this mortal ſtate, and approach the ſolemn period of death, how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſhall we uſually find the temper of their minds then! How differently will a review
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008878_0024_10309C885606E698"/>
of their reſpective characters affect them then! Then thoſe tragical ſcenes, which, for a while, might excite the admiration and applauſe of half-thinking mortals, will produce no joyful reflections, to ſooth the a king hearts of theſe men of blood. Their minds, if deſtitute of any other ſupport, beſides what ariſes from a review of their unchriſtian heroiſm, muſt be either ſtrangely ſtupid, or elſe filled with the moſt gloomy images—Images of that blackneſs of darkneſs to which they are going. But "at even time it ſhall uſually be light" with thoſe that have ſhone in the other character. Their having the ſpirit of Chriſt, is a good evidence that they are his;—his true diſciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; intereſted in all the promiſes of his goſpel; intitled to all the important bleſſings of his purchaſe. Such will have hope in their death, and immortal light and glory dawning upon them, when they cloſe their eyes upon this world. There is no truer ſtandard by which to judge of actions and characters, than the aſpect they have upon the eternal ſtate, and their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to make us happy or miſerable there. And if we make this a deciſive rule in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, how much more noble and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, will a victory over our own ſpirits ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008878_0025_10309C8DA50A1DE0"/>
than any martial atchievements, while we are ſtrangers to ſelf-government! The one, will leave us in the power of our worſt enemies; in a ſtate of eſtrangement from God; without any intereſt in his favor; and doomed to the ſtrange puniſhment appointed for the workers of iniquity:—while the other, reſcues us from the power of corrupt luſts and affections; vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates us into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God; accompliſhes the deſign of Chriſt's death upon us; and prepares us to receive an unfading crown of life. "To him that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh," ſays our ſaviour, "will I give to ſit with me on my throne, even as I overcame, and am ſet down with my father on his throne."</p>
            <p>THUS I have endeavoured a compariſon of the characters in our text, with regard to the influence they have upon our honor, uſefulneſs and comfort here, and our happineſs in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate. The deſign of this comparative view is not to ſet them in oppoſition, or to repreſent them inconſiſtent with each other; but to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their reſpective worth. And is not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of this compariſon plainly this, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is truly excellent and uſeful, in itſelf conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; while the other is ſo, only when it is found in connection with the former?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:008878_0026_10309C8F4B6B9D50"/>LET us all be animated, by what has been offered, to purſue them with a zeal proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to their importance. Let us view them in a proper light, and poſſeſs our minds with a lively ſenſe of their reſpective uſefulneſs; and ſhall we not find, that, while the things which ſerve to promote the one, ought to be done; thoſe that promote the other, ought not to be left undone?</p>
            <p>I HOPE none will think I miſtake the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of our being together at this time; or bring a diſcourſe rather to diſcountenance, than encourage, a military ſpirit; rather to ſink, than raiſe, the character of a ſoldier. Sure nothing is more diſtant from my intention; nor can I think this has been done, unleſs it has by atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the true ſpirit and meaning of that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of ſcripture, which is the foundation of the preſent diſcourſe. The reaſonable and religious government of our ſpirits, which I have been deſcribing, how much more important an attainment ſoever it may be, than that with which it has been compared, is yet, far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to a military ſpirit; or from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any tendency to weaken or deſtroy it: ſo far, that I believe it will be found the only true
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008878_0027_10309C92379CA608"/>
baſis upon which it can be built; by which it can be ſupported; and in connection with which it can be uſeful and good.</p>
            <p>WHEN men become <hi>ſlow to anger,</hi> and learn to <hi>rule their ſpirits,</hi> they certainly concur with the dictates of reaſon, and the word of God; and therefore cannot, on that account, be ſaid to oppoſe a military ſpirit; unleſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and revelation tend to do it. That the former has not ſuch a tendency, I need not ſpend time to prove; and that the latter has not, is eaſily collected from many paſſages of ſcripture, not only in the old teſtament, where God ſtiles himſelf "a man of war," and "the Lord of hoſts;" and where we find, that troops were led out to battle by God's expreſs command; that he "taught their hands to war, and their fingers to fight," and made them victorious by his mighty arm; but alſo in the new teſtament, where, of the prince of peace himſelf it is ſaid, that "in righteouſneſs he doth judge and make war"; and where we find the meſſenger ſent before Chriſt's face, to prepare his way, implicitly owning the lawfulneſs of a military life, in the anſwer which he gave to the ſoldiers demand;
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008878_0028_10309C93EA7F3DF0"/>
"And what ſhall we do"? He does not tell them to quit their profeſſion as unlawful and ſcandalous: he does not intimate that there is any thing in their employment inconſiſtent with the deſign of chriſtianity, then about to be introduced: but admoniſhes them of the importance of ruling their ſpirits, and keeping them under the reſtraints of religion. <hi>Do vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to no man</hi>—as if he had ſaid,—"Think not, that becauſe you are armed with the weapons of deſtruction, you may wantonly violate the laws of humanity, and forcibly take from men their properties, or their lives."—<hi>Be content with your wages</hi>— "Suppreſs an avaricious ſpirit: let not a deſire of inriching yourſelves, be the main principle from which you act: nor ſuffer your minds to be diſcompoſed, though you ſhould not ſucceed in your wiſhes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of increaſing your ſubſtance."</p>
            <p>'TIS a departure from ſuch neceſſary regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of temper and conduct, which renders the ſoldier unchriſtian and baſe; when the only military accompliſhments he can boaſt, are a mind fierce and inhuman, that "fears not God nor regards man", an "arm of fleſh", and "feet that are ſwift to ſhed blood".</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:008878_0029_10309C994096B608"/>SUCH is the preſent ſituation of human af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that recourſe muſt be had to the art of war. And 'til mens minds are bro't under the gentle ſway of reaſon and religion; 'til this is perfectly and univerſally the caſe; ſo that every one, content with his own, ſhall by no unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful meaſures endeavour to poſſeſs himſelf of what belongs to another; ſo that envy and fraud, encroachment, and oppreſſion ſhall be wholly laid aſide and forgotten; forcible me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of defence will be neceſſary. Every one knows that this is not the preſent condition of mankind; every one therefore, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the uſefulneſs and importance of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſkill and proweſs; and accordingly that endeavours for the promotion hereof, are not only lawful, but honorable.</p>
            <p>BUT not to enlarge—</p>
            <p>I TURN myſelf to you gentlemen of the ARTILLERY, at whoſe invitation we are now aſſembled in the houſe of worſhip.</p>
            <p>IN aiming at ſuperior military accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you act conſiſtently with your character, and ſuitably to the preſent ſtate of the world. By this means your <hi>ancient</hi> company will, not
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008878_0030_10309C9AE2871898"/>
only poſſeſs, but deſerve, the title of <hi>honorable.</hi> The generous and public ſpirit which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear poſſeſs'd of, who devote themſelves to the ſervice of their country, will conciliate for them univerſal love and eſteem; and, at the ſame time, fill their own minds with ſolid pleaſure and ſatisfaction. Under the influence and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of HIS EXCELLENCY, the captain general, we hope you will not only ſupport a martial ſpirit in general, but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to cultivate <hi>the regular art of war;</hi> the neceſſity and importance whereof, in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, beyond what was requiſite in our infant ſtate, when we had no enemy to meet in the field, when our warfare was only with undiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined ſavages in the wilderneſs, we truſt does not eſcape your notice and attention. The preſent war has afforded undeniable proofs, that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſucceed in battle the military art muſt <hi>be ſtudied.</hi> Your knowledge and experience herein, Gentlemen, we hope will be carried to ſuch a pitch, as will not only render you pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly uſeful yourſelves, if called to action; but alſo have a good influence to excite in others, a laudable ambition to excell in the ſame things. And you will ſuffer me to remind you, that, in order to your example's being loved and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008878_0031_10309C9DC45037B0"/>
followed, it will be neceſſary for you to ſhine, not only in the common ornaments of a ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, but alſo in what is very conſiſtent herewith, "the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit." To be uſefully acquainted with the art of war, you muſt not be ſtrangers to the religion of the prince of peace. Would you conquer others, you muſt not be conquered by your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,— by your own luſts and affections. Slavery breaks the ſpirits, and ſubdues the force of the mind: and certainly no ſlavery can be more effectual to do it, than to be maſtered by your own paſſions. Would you therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the comfort, honor and advantage of your character, as ſoldiers, inliſt yourſelves under the banner of Chriſt; be firmly perſuaded of the excellency and uſefulneſs of his ſpirit; and let your endeavors to poſſeſs yourſelves of it, be animated in proportion thereto.</p>
            <p>TO CONCLUDE,—Let us all be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the doctrine of our text. Let us all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to have our minds deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of the importance of ruling our ſpirits. In this we may ſtrive to excel, without being guilty of lawleſs ambition, or inglorious pride. This will be our honor and happineſs, whatever our ſtations in life are, whatever the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008878_0032_10309C9F69D25450"/>
of the world, of our nation, and land. This will not be the leſs uſeful, if, through the kindneſs of heaven, our hopes ſucceed, and the preſent war ſhould iſſue in an honorable and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace; when "our ſwords ſhall be beaten into plough-ſhares, and our ſpears into pruning-hooks;" and our brethren of the military character, ſhall leave the fatigues of the camp, to improve in agriculture, that peaceful, but too much neglected art.</p>
            <p>THE conſideration of the infinite advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this conqueſt over our ſpirits, may well inſpire us with reſolution to encounter all the difficulties that lie in the way hereof. And that there are difficulties, great and numerous, is a truth, which, far from denying or conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I muſt repeatedly inſiſt upon, and ſtrongly urge the belief of: ſuch difficulties as many ſhall faintly ſeek to overcome, and ſhall not be able: ſuch as will require all our ſtrength and fortitude to reſiſt; and all, will be found too little, without power from on high. He only "that formed the ſpirit of man within him," can form it to a new and divine temper. To him therefore, let our thoughts be directed: to him let us all repair: His grace let us earneſtly implore: and for our encouragement herein,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008878_0033_10309CA24D0311E8"/>
he has declared himſelf ready to give the holy ſpirit to them that aſk him: and if we "walk in this ſpirit we ſhall not fulfil the unlawful deſires of the fleſh and of the mind."</p>
            <p>LET us "war a good warfare," and "fight the good fight of faith;" humbly "looking to Jeſus, the captain of our ſalvation," without whom we can do nothing; but thro' the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of whoſe ſpirit "we can do all things;" and ſhall come off more than conquerors in this ſpiritual conflict. This victory, my brethren, will produce the happieſt conſequences.—It will enable us to enjoy ourſelves, and our friends.— It will lay a foundation for preſent comfort, and uſefulneſs.—It will ſecure peace and ſafety at the cloſe of life.— It will give the temper of heaven, and render us meet to enter the manſions of glory.</p>
            <p>LET us endeavour to lay our ſouls open to the full power of theſe important conſiderations, and act under the influence of them, 'til "the ſame mind is produced in us which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus;" and we are prepared to enter his peaceful kingdom, where univerſal love and harmony reign for ever and ever.</p>
