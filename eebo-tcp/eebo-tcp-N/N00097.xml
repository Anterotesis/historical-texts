            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE &amp; DEATH OF Mr. Richard Mather.</head>
            <p>THe Writing and Reading of <hi>the Lives of Wortky Ones,</hi> hath been by some accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the most profitable works of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun. The Labours of some Learned amongst the Gentiles this way have not been altogether without benefit, witness what is done by <hi>Pluterch, Laertius, Philostratus, Eunapius, Pliny,</hi> &amp;c. albeit they are to be read with judgement. But especially the faithful Descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the <hi>Lives</hi> of those who have been <hi>Eminent Teachers</hi> in the Church, hath been to the great advantage of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ages. Many have reaped benefit by reading <hi>Dorotheus</hi> his Collection of the Lives of the Prophets, Apostles, and Seventy Disciples of Christ: And (not to speak of the Labours of <hi>Gennadius, Epiphanius, Isidore,</hi> and <hi>Prochorus</hi> of old) among later Writers, <hi>Shopfius</hi> his <hi>Academia Christi,</hi> and <hi>Tossanus</hi> concerning <hi>the Lives of the Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Melchior Adam</hi> concerning <hi>the Lives of all our Modern Divines,</hi> as farre as he could by any means come to the knowledge thereof. The pains which Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> hath taken in publishing the Lives of many of our English Worthies, hath been profitable to not a few: And great pity it is that more should not be done that way. If the Lives of <hi>Brightman, Parker, Ames, Barroughs, Hooker,</hi> &amp;c. were published to the World, it might be of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall advantage. Nor is it to be doubted but that there have been many famous in their Generations, whose Memories are
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000150_0005_0FA2B2E0074E1630"/>
buried in the dust, for want of some one to undertake and office, whereby their Names might have been perpetuated to Posterity.</p>

               </gap> to God, that his grace towards and in his Servers, and the wonders of his Providence about them, should be kept in remembrance. Therefore some have written their own Lives. So did (not to mention <hi>Josephus, Bellarmius, Cardan</hi>) amongst our Worthies, <hi>Junius, Collinus, Buchanan;</hi> and of our own Nation, <hi>Bale, Burton, Hall, Bealy,</hi> &amp;c. And the like did this Reverend Man who is to be the Subject of the ensuing Discourse <hi>essay</hi> to do; and proceeded therein to the 39th year of his Age, but finished not what he had purposed. It remaineth therefore that some other should do it, which we shall in following words of truck and plainess endeavour to do.</p>
            <p>THere is in the Parish of <hi>Winnick</hi> in the Country of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster,</hi> a small Country Town or Village called <hi>Lowton:</hi> In which Village <hi>Richard Mather</hi> was born <hi>Anno</hi> 1596. His Parents <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Margarite Mather</hi> were of Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in <hi>Lowton</hi> aforesaid, but by reason of some unhappy Mortgages they were reduced unto a low condition as to the World. Nevertheless, God so disposed their hearts, that they were willing to Educate this their Son in good Learning: Concerning which he (after that the Lord was pleased to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow not onely Learning but Grace upon him) hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expressed himself, saying, <hi>By what principles and motives my Parents were chiefly induced to keep me at School, I have not to say, nor do I certainly know. But this I must needs say, that this was the singular good Providence of God towards me, (who hath the hearts of all men in his hand) thus to incline the hearts: of my Parents; for in this thing the Lord of Heaven shewed me 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000150_0006_0FA2B2E0C74603C8"/>
such favour, as had not been shewed to many my Predecessors, and Contemporaries in that place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now his Parents being strongly bent in spirit to have their Son a Scholar, they sent him to <hi>Winwick</hi> School, which was about four miles distant from his Fathers house. In the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter season they boarded him at <hi>Winwick;</hi> but such was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after knowledge, that in the Summer he travelled every day thither. Whil'st he was thus at School he met with no small discouragement, for that the Schoolmaster under whom he was, although he had an excellent faculty for teaching in Grammar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Learning, and many were trained up by him, so as to be sent unto <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for Instruction in higher Studies; yet was he very severe and partial in his discipline. <hi>Junius</hi> was almost quite discouraged from his Studies, when being a School boy his Master would beat him eight times in a day whether in fault or in no fault: The like Magisterial harshness caused him of whom we write, earnestly desire that his Father would take him from School, and dispose of him to some other Calling. Himself afterwards, when he had waded through these Difficulties, would say, <hi>God intended better for me, then I would have chosen for my self; and therefore my Father, though in other things indulgent enough, yet in this would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to my request, but by putting me in hope that by his speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Master, things would be amended, would still over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule me to go on in my Studies; and good it was for me to be over-ruled by him, and his discretion, rather then to be left to my own affection and desire. But Oh that all Schoolmasters would learn Wisdome, Moderation and Equity towards their Scholars, and seek rather to Win the hearts of Children by righteous, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and courteous usage, then to alunate their mindes by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality and undue severity, which had been my after undoing, had not the good Providence of God, and the Wisdome and Authority of my Father prevented.</hi> But thus was that of the Poet made good:</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:000150_0007_0FA2B2E1B8D2F770"/>After that he had spent sundry years in this School, some Popish Merchants coming out of <hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Warrington,</hi> which is two miles from <hi>Winwick,</hi> were inquisitive whether there were not any pregnant Wits in that School whom they might procure for Apprentices. Presently <hi>Richard Mather</hi> was mentioned to them as a pregnant Youth: Whereupon applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made accordingly to his Father, who was inclineable to accept of this Motion, because now his Estate was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, that he almost despaired of bringing up this his Son as he had intended. But here the Finger of Divine Providence was observable; for when his Father was ready thus to part with his Son, and the Childe to go, the Lord raised up the heart of his Master, to be importunate with his Father still to keep him at School, professing that it was great pity that a Wit so prone to Learning should be taken from it, (as indeed it was) or that he should be undone by Popish Education. The Perswasions of the Master so farre prevailed, as that his Scholar was still continued under him, until the fifteenth year of his Age.</p>
            <p>It was a mercy to him, that whil'st he was yet in his Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he enjoyed the publick Ministry of one Mr. <hi>Palin,</hi> then Preacher at <hi>Leagh;</hi> of whom he would say, that the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that man was Comfortable and Honourable in his thoughts, even in his old Age, though his knowledge of him was in his Childhood: He then observed such a plain, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and piercing efficacy in Mr. <hi>Palins</hi> Ministry, as was not to be seen in the common sort of Preachers in those dayes, by means whereof some Illumination, though not a through-Conversion, was wrought in him.</p>
            <p>Having been thus long kept at School, he was called to leave his Fathers Family. The occasion whereof was this. At a place called <hi>Toxteth Park</hi> near <hi>Liverpool,</hi> there dwelt a wise and Religious People, who being desirous of the good of themselves and their Posterity, intended to erect a School amongst them, for the Education of their Children. It came into their mindes to send unto the Schoolmaster of <hi>Winwick,</hi> to enquire whether he had any of his Scholars whom he would
<pb facs="unknown:000150_0008_0FA2B2E48C7AE2A0"/>
recommend unto them for such a Service: who having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their desires, forthwith communicated the same to this his Scholar, and to his Father, to see if the Motion would stand with their acceptance. He was desirous rather to have gone to the University, but his Father closed with the Offer; whence it was in fine mutually embraced, so that he removed from his Fathers house to <hi>Toxteth</hi> (<hi>Anno</hi>1611.) there to teach School. Nor is it any disparagement to his Worth that he was once a Schoolmaster; for very eminent Divines have been so, as of our own Nation Mr. <hi>Hieron,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Vines,</hi> not to mention others, but rather an Eminency; the like seldome known, that one should be found fit to be a <hi>Schoolmaster at fifteen years of Age:</hi> Yet the Lord helped him in those his young years to carry it with such Wisdome and Love and Gravity amongst his Scholars as was to admination, so as that he was by them both loved and feared, beyond what is usual, even where there are aged Masters.</p>
            <p>His being thus employed was more wayes then one advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to him: for by this means he became a more acurate Grammarian then Divines usually are. Being also diligent in his Studies whil'st he continued in this way of Imployment, he became a Proficient in other Arts, as in <hi>Logick, Rhetorick,</hi> yea and in <hi>Theology.</hi> Moreover, it afterwards appeared to be of God, that he was Called to such a Work in such a place, for there the effectual Conversion of his Soul unto the Lord, was wrought in his tender years, even afore his going to <hi>Oxford;</hi> whence he was preserved from those Corruptions which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did many of his Contemporaries, through the Temptation which in the University they met with. The means of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version was partly by seeing a strange difference between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and sundry in that godly Family, where Divine Providence had cast his Lot in <hi>Toxteth,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Family of Mr. <hi>Edward Aspinwall,</hi> who was a Learned and Religious Gentleman. Now he observed that the way and walking of that holy man, was such as himself had not as yet been accustomed unto, which caused sad fears to arise in his Soul, lest haply he might not be in the way which leadeth unto Eternal Salvation.

            <p>Being thus become a <hi>New Creature,</hi> he was the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently a Blessing in the Family, and in the Calling which the Lord had disposed of him in: And such notice was taken of him, as that even from places remote Children were sent unto him for Instruction and Education; and many were, by the Lords blessing upon his Endeavours, fitted for, and sent unto the <hi>University.</hi> Some years having been past over in this way of Employ, he resolved (<hi>

               </hi>) to spend some time in one of the Universities, as apprehending that there, by converse with Learned men, and other Advantages not elswhere to be had, he might gain more then by his private Studies in the Country. Accordingly he went to <hi>Oxford,</hi> and continued for some time there in <hi>Brazen-Nose Colledge.</hi> Being there, he was variously affected: for it was a joy to him to finde many there who had been his <hi>quondam</hi> Scholars.

Ramus;</hi> which counsel he followed, and saw no cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of his so doing. But before he had spent so much time in <hi>Oxford</hi> as he could have wished that he might have done; the People in <hi>Toxteth,</hi> whose Children had been taught by him, sent to him, desiring that he would return unto them to instruct not so much their Children as themselves, and that not in meer Hamane Literature, but in the things of God. This Call, after due Consideration, for weighty Reasons he accepted of. Being then returned to <hi>Toxteth,</hi> he Preached his first Sermon <hi>November</hi> 30. 1618. There was a very great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of people to hear him, and his Labours were highly accepted of by the judicious: Such was the vastness of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, as that the things which he had prepared and intended to deliver at once, contained no less then six long Sermons. The people having had some taste of his Gifts, were the more importunate in their desires that he might continue amongst them. And because that could not be without <hi>Episcapal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> they urged him to accept thereof: Not having at that time so throughly looked into that part of <hi>Ceremonious Conformity</hi> as after wards, he yielded unto the Motion; and accordingly was <hi>Ordained</hi> (with many others on the same day) by Doctor <hi>Morton</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Chester</hi> after the Mode of those Times. The Ordination being over, the Bishop singled our Mr.<hi>Mather</hi> from amongst the rest, saying, <hi>I have Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say to you betwixt you and me alone.</hi> Mr.<hi>Mather</hi> was then afraid lest some Informations might have been given in to the Bishop against him because of his <hi>Puritanism,</hi> thereby to prejudice him; but it hapned to be otherwise: for when the Bishop had him alone, <hi>I have</hi> (faith he) <hi>an earnest Request un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and you must not deny me; It is that you would pray for me: for I know</hi> (said he) <hi>the Prayers of men that fear God will avail much, and you I believe are such an one.</hi> Nevertheless, after that the Lord gave him to see the evil <hi>of the sin of Conformity</hi> in the whole latitude of it, (for as to the substance of Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, even from his first entrance upon the Ministry he saw the evil thereof, and was by Divine Grace kept from being stained there with) his Conforming (although it was at the desires of

               </gap>o accept of this <hi>Ordination</hi> from the <hi>Prelate,</hi> was no small grief of heart to him. Many years after, one of his Sons taking notice of a torn Parchment in his Fathers Study, enquired what it is; unto whom his Father replied, That he received that when he was Ordained by the Bishop: <hi>And (said he) I tore it, because I took no pleasure in keeping a monument of my sin and folly in submitting to that Superstition, the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance whereof is grevious to me.</hi>

            <p>Being as hath been related, setled in the Ministry at <hi>Toxteth,</hi> he resolved to change his single condition: And accordingly he became a Sui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Motion for several years met with Obstructions, by reason of her Fathers not being affected towards Non-conformable puritans: But at last he gave his Consent that Mr.<hi>Mather</hi> should marry his Daughter; the Match therefore was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated <hi>Septemb.</hi> 29. 1624, God made her to become a rich Blessing to him, continuing them together for the space of above 30 years. By her God gave him six Sons; four whereos (<hi>

During his abode there, he was abundant in Labours in the Gospel: For every Lords-day he Preached twice at <hi>Toxteth,</hi> and once in a Fortnight on the Third day of the Week he kept a <hi>Lecture</hi> at the Town of Prescot. Also, faithful and powerful Preaching being then rare in those parts, he did frequently Preach upon the <hi>Holy dayes</hi>(as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) being often thereunto desired by godly Christians of other Parishes in that Country: And this he did, not as thinking that there was any Holiness in those times (or in any other day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Lords-day) beyond what belongs to every day; but because then there would be an opportunity of great Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,

and it is good casting the Net where there is much Fish: for which cause it might be that the Apostles Preached mostly in Populous Towns and Cities, and also (which suiteth with what we are speaking) on the <hi>Jewish Sabbaths</hi> after their abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as to any Religious tye upon Conscience for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.

                           <p n="1">1.

            <p>These Arguments were thus presented to the Consideration of some godly Ministers, and other Christians in <hi>Lancashire,</hi> at several Meetings for that end. Nothing was satisfactorily said

And hereunto he was the more inclined, by some Letters of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hockers</hi> who were lately arrived in <hi>New-England,</hi> and wrote (as then there was cause) very encouragingly unto godly people to come after them.

The Relation of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable Providence we shall here set down in Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> own words, left written by himself in his <hi>Journall</hi> from <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire</hi> to <hi>New-England.</hi> Thus he writeth concerning it.</p>
            <p>August 15. 1635. <hi>The Lord had not at done with us, nor had be let us see all his Power and Goodness which be would have us take the knowledge of And therefore about break of day, be sent a most terrible Storm of Rain and Easterly Wind, whereby we were in as much danger as I think ever people were. when we came to Land, we sound many mighty Trees rent in thoes in the midst of the Bole, and others turned up by the Roots, by the fierceness thereof. we lost in that Morning three Anchors and Cables, one having never been in the water before; two were broken by the violence of the Storm, and the third out by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in extremity of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to save the Ship and their and our Lives. And when our Cables and Anchors were all lost, we had no outward means of Deliverance but by hoysing Sail, if so be we might get to Sea, from amongst the Islands and Rocks where we had Anchored: But the Lord let us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee that our sails could not save us neither, no more then the Cables and Anchors; for by the force of the Wind and Storm the Sails were rent asunder, and split in pieces as if they had been but rotten Rags, so that of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them there was scarce lost as much as an band-breadth, that was not rent in pieces, or blown away into the Sea: So that at that time all hope that we should be saved, in regard of any outward appearance, was utterly taken away; and the rather,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000150_0025_0FA2B2F2C32E25E0"/>
because we seemed to drive with full force of wind directly upon a mighty Rock standing out in sight above water, so that me did but continually wait when we should bear and feel the doleful crash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ship upon the Rock. In this extremity and appearance of Death, as distress and distraction would suffer us, we cried to the Lord, and he was pleased to have compassion upon us: for by his over-ruling Providence, and his own immediate good hand, he guided the Ship past the Rock, asswaged the violence of the Sea and of the Wind. It was a day much to be remembred, because on that day the Lord granted us as wonderful a deliverance, as I think over any people had felt. The Seamen confessed they never knew the like. The Lord so imprint the memory of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>vous Storm my fear was the less, when I consedered the clearness of my Calling from God this way. And in some measure (the Lords holy Name be blessed for it) be gave us hearts contented and willing that he should do with us and ours what be pleased, and what might be most for the glory of the Name, and in that we rested our selves. But when news was brought us into the Gun-room that the danger was past, Oh how our hearts did then relent, and melt within us! we burst out into tears of joy amongst our selves in love unto our gracious God, and admiration of his kindness, in granting to his poor Servants such an Extraordinary and Miraculous Deliverance. His b holy Name be blessed for ever!</hi>

            <p>Thus farre is Mr. <hi>Mathers</hi> Relation of this signal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as left written with his own hand. And this is the more to be taken notice of, because the lives of several Choice Instruments of Gods Glory, were then saved: For not onely Mr.<hi>Mather</hi> himself, but two of his Sons, who are now faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers of God, were in that Vessel; and so likewise was that Worthy Minister of Christ Mr. <hi>Jonathan Mitchell,</hi> late Faithful and Famous pastor of the Church of <hi>Cambridge</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> he being then a Childe of Eleven years of

Also there was then a Ship, going between <hi>Piscataqua</hi> and the <hi>Bay,</hi> which was ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> Mr. <hi>Avery,</hi> who with his Wife and five Children all perished. This Minister (though it be a <hi>Digr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And by the way let it further be noted, That this which hath been mentioned is the onely Vessel which miscarried with Passengers from <hi>Old England</hi> to <hi>New;</hi> so signally did the Lord in his Providence own the Plantation of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (to digress no further) this Storm being allayed, the Lord brought them safe to an Anchor before <hi>Boston, August</hi> 17. 1635 Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> abode with his Family for some Moneths in <hi>Boston;</hi> and both he and his gracious Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He was, because of his Age, Gravity, Grace and Wisdome wherewith the Lord had endowed and adorned him, chosen the <hi>Moderator</hi> in that <hi>Reverend Assembly.</hi> For divers dayes after his being thus in <hi>Consultation,</hi> he enjoyed his Health as formerly, or rather better then for some time of late. But as <hi>Luther</hi> when As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in a <hi>Synod</hi> was surprized with a violent Fit of the Stone, whence he was forced to return home, his Friends having little hopes of his life; so it was with this holy man. For <hi>April</hi> 16. 1669. he was in the night, being then in his sons house in <hi>Boston,</hi> taken exceeding ill through a totall stoppage of his Urine. The next morning he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home to <hi>Dorchester.</hi> Great was the favour of God towards him, that he should be <hi>found about</hi> such a <hi>blessed work</hi> as then he was ingaged in, for the Lord found him sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and earnestly endeavouring to be a peace-maker.

Onely his Son who is now <hi>Teacher</hi> of a Church in <hi>Boston,</hi> coming to visit his Father, and perceiving the Symptomes of Death to be upon him, said unto him, <hi>Sir, if there be any speciall thing which you would recommend unto me to do, in case the Lord should spare me upon the Earth, after you are in Heaven, I would intreat you to express it.</hi> At the which, his Father making a little pause, and lifting up his eyes and hands to Heaven, replied, <hi>A speciall thing which I would commend to you, is, Care concerning the Rising Generation in this Country, that they be brought under the Government of Christ in his Church; and that when grown up and qualified, they have Baptism for their Children. I must confess I have been defective as to practise, yet I have publickly declared my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and manifested my desires to practise that which I think ought to be attended; but the Dissenting of some in our Church discouraged me. I have thought that persons might have Right to Baptism, and yet not to the Lords Supper; and I see no cause to alter my judgement as to that particular. And I still think that persons qualified according to the Fifth Proposition of the late Synod-Book, have Right to Baptism for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His bodily Pains continued upon him untill <hi>April</hi> 22. when in the Morning his Son aforementioned, coming to visit him, asked his Father if he knew him; to whom he Replied that he did, but was not able to speak any more to him: Whereupon his Son saying, <hi>Now you will speedily be in the joy of your Lord;</hi> His Father lifted up his hands, but could not speak. Not long after his Son again spoke to him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000150_0031_0FA2B2F81AC564C0"/>
               <hi>You will quickly see Jesus Christ, and that will make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds for all your pains and sorrows:</hi> At which words his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again lifted up his hands; but after that he took notice of no person or thing, but continuing speechless untill about 10 <hi>h. P. M.</hi> he quietly breathed forth his last. Thus did that Light that had been shining in the Church above Fifty years, Expire.</p>
            <p>As some of the Lords precious ones have had a reall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and prae sense of their approaching Dissolution imprinted on their Spirits; so it is noted of <hi>Ambrose</hi> and of <hi>Gorgonia</hi> of old: and of <hi>Gesner, Melancthon,</hi> and <hi>

                  </gap>anford</hi> among Modern Divines: Thus it was with this holy man some time afore his departure. The last Text which be taught from, and insisted long thereon, was that 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 4.6,7,8. <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand; I have fought a good sight, I have finished my course, I have kept the Faith: Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge will give me at that day; and not to me onely, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</hi> And the portion of Scripture which before that he had insisted upon, was <hi>Job</hi> 14. 14. <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time, will I wait till my change come.</hi> The Lord found his blessed Servant so doing. Also the last private <hi>Conference-Meeting</hi> which he was at in <hi>Dorchester,</hi> he had prepared to speak from those words, 2<hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the Heavens:</hi> But bodily pains prevented him from speaking what was in his heart to have expressed; the Lord intending that he should no more speak of, but see that place which he had so much and so often thought on, and long prayed and longed to enjoy.</p>
            <p>He was, especially in his last Sickness, <hi>a Pattern of Patience.</hi> For although extremity of pain, without any acute Disease, was that which brought him to his Grave, yet he did never so much as once cry out from first to last; and it was very rare to hear him so much as groan (but never grumble) under
<pb facs="unknown:000150_0032_0FA2B2F90B3435B8"/>
his dolorous Griefs. In this Sickness, whereof he died, he was much delighted in reading Doctor <hi>Goodwins</hi> Discourse about <hi>Patience,</hi> in which Book he read till the very day of his Death. Once in his Sickness, his Son saying to him, that inasmuch as several small Stones were come from him in his Urine, now possible he might have some ease; his Father answered with an affecting earnestness of expression, <hi>As for that matter, the Will of the Lord be done.</hi> Such was his grace and patience. And at the same time his Son saying to him, <hi>God hath shewed his great faithfulness unto you, having upheld you now for the space of more then Fifty years in his Service, and imployed you therein without ceasing, which can be said of very few men upon the face of the whole Earth.</hi> His Father replied <hi>You say true; I must acknowledge the mercy of God hath been great towards me all my dayes: but I must also acknowledge, that I have had many failings, and the thought of them abaseth me, and worketh patience in me.</hi> When any one asked him how he did; his usual Answer was, <hi>Far from well, yet far better then my iniquities deserve.</hi> Thus did he (like old <hi>Austin</hi> who died reading the Penitential Psalms) keep <hi>up a spirit of Repentance</hi> to the last.</p>
            <p>As he was a man faithful and fearing God above many, so the Lord shewed great faithfulness unto him, both in making him serviceable unto the last, yea and continuing the vigour of his Spirit, and power of his Ministry. Few men, though young, are known to Preach with such vigour as he did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

It was a special token of Divine favour unto some of the Ancients, that their Sons after them succeeded in the Ministry; so was it with the Fathers of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory Nyssen, Basil, Hilary, &amp;c.</hi> And the Lord cheered the heart of this his Servant in his old Age, by giving him to see most of his Sons imployed in the Ministry many years before their precious Father's decease. He left four Sons in that Work; one of whom, <abbr>

the principal hand in the <hi>Platform of Discipline,</hi> and had he not changed his judgement from that? His Answer was, <hi>No, not in any one particular that I know of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His way of preaching was plain, aiming to shoot his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows not over his peoples heads, but into their Hearts and Consciences. Whence he studiously avoided obscure phrases, Exotick words, or an unnecessary citation of Latine Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which some men addict themselves to the use of. Mr. <hi>Dod</hi> was wont to say, That <hi>so much Latine was so much flesh in a Sermon:</hi> So did this humble man look upon the affectation of such things in a <hi>Popular Auditory</hi> to savour of Carnal wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The Lord gave him an excellent faculty in making ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struse things plain, that in handling the deepest Mysteries he would accommodate himself to Vulgar Capacities, that even the meanest might learn something. He knew how to express <gap reason="foreign" extent="4 words">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> He would often use that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Artis est celare Artem.</hi> And much approved that of <hi>Austin; If</hi> (said he) <hi>I preach Learnedly, then onely the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and not the Unlearned can understand and profit by me; but if I preach plainly, then Learned and Unlearned both can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, so I may profit all.</hi> He was <hi>Mighty in the Scriptures:</hi> Whence Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> would say of him, <hi>My Brother</hi> Mather <hi>is a mighty man.</hi> Also his usuall way of Delivery was very Powerful, Awakening, and Zealous; especially in his younger years, there being few men of so great strength of body as he, which together with his natural fervour of Spirit, being sanctified, made his Ministry the more powerful. And the Lord went forth with his Labours to the Conversion of many, both in <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>New-England,</hi> Yet though his way of Preaching was plain and zealous, it was moreover Substantial and very Judicious, Even in his beginning times, Mr. <hi>Gillebrand</hi> (a famous Minister in <hi>Lancashire;</hi> and the more famous, for that though he did exceedingly Stammer in his ordinary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he would pray and preach as fluently as any man) once having heard him Preach, asked what his Name might be? And answer being made that his Name was <hi>Mather;</hi> Nay (said Mr. <hi>Gillebrand</hi>) call him <hi>Matter,</hi> for believe it this man
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:000150_0035_0FA2B2FB061A5CD8"/>
hath Substance in him. Yea, such was his <hi>Solidity of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that some who were his Opposites, yet did therefore greatly respect and honour him. Doctor <hi>Parr</hi> (then Bishop in the Isle of <hi>Man</hi>) having heard Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was Silenced, lamented it, saying, <hi>If</hi> Mather <hi>be Silenced I am sorry for it, for he was a solid man, and the Church of God hath then a great loss.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Because he was esteemed eminently <hi>Judicious,</hi> therefore amongst the Reverend Elders in <hi>New-England,</hi> he was much improved in Managing the Controversies then under Debate about Church-Government. The Discourse about the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Covenant,</hi> and the Answer to the XXXII. <hi>Questions,</hi> both written <hi>Anno</hi> 1639. although they pass under the Name of the Elders of <hi>New-England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mather</hi> was the sole Author of, as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in his Answer to <hi>Baily, pag.</hi>70. and Answer to <hi>Williams, pag.</hi>63. and Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Mather</hi> in his Epistle to the XXI. <hi>Questions</hi> concerning Church-members and their Children, have truely related. And when there was a Synod called to Convene at <hi>Cambridge, Anno</hi> 1647. that Reverend Assembly desired three Elders to draw up <hi>A Modell of Church Government</hi> against the next Session, <abbr>

As to his general Calling; He was much in Prayer, especially in his Study, where he oft-times spent whole dayes with God in suing for a Blessing upon himself and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and upon the people to whom he was related, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole Country where he lived. The Requests which upon such occasions he put up to God in Jesus Christ, and also how his heart was moved to believe that God heard him, he left (many of them) in writing amongst his private Papers, I suppose that so himself might have recourse unto those <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences</hi>

in a time of darkness and Temptation; also that his Sons after him might see by their Fathers Example, what it is to <hi>walk before God.</hi> Now what a loss is it to the world when such a Righteous man is taken away! Well might <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> weep bitterly, when they heard of the death of any such men, because it portended evil to the places where they had lived, and served God. As he was much in Prayer, so he was very frequent in <hi>Hearing the Word.</hi> It was his manner to attend several Lectures in Neighbour-Congregations, untill his Disease made him unable to ride; yea and usually even to his old Age (as did Mr. <hi>Hildersham</hi>) he took Notes from those whom he heard, professing that he found profit in it.</p>
            <p>As to his particular Calling, he was even from his youth a hard Student. Yea his minde was so intent upon his Work and Studies, that the very morning before he died, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned those Friends that watched with him to help him into his Study: They urging that he was not able to go so farre, he desired them to help him and try; which they did: but ere he was come to the door of his Lodging-room, <hi>I see</hi> (faith he) <hi>I am not able, yet I have not been in my Study several dayes, and is it not a lamentable thing that I should lose so much time?</hi> After his entrance upon the Ministry, he was not onely in <hi>England</hi> (as hath been said) but in <hi>New-England</hi> abundant in Labours: for except when he had an Assistant with him (which was seldome) he Preached twice every Lords-day; and a Lecture once a fortnight, besides many occasionall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons both in Publick and in Private. Also he was much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in answering many practical <hi>Cases of Conscience,</hi> and in Polemical, especially Disciplinary Discourses. In his Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ministry in <hi>Dorchester</hi> he went over <hi>The Book of Genesis to Chap.</hi> 38. <hi>Psalm</hi> 16. <hi>The whole Book of the Prophet Zechariah, Matthews Gospel,</hi> to <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> to <hi>Thess.

            <p>It hath been the manner of some, in writing Lives to insert the <hi>Wilis</hi> of those whose Lives and Death they have described.

It was written with his own hand <hi>Octob.</hi> 16. 1661. And beginneth as followeth.</p>
            <p>I Richard Mather, <hi>considering the certainty of death, and the uncertainty of the time thereof, and withall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be the will of God that a man should set his House in order before he depart this life, Do make this my last Will and Testament in mazner following. First of all, I acknowledge the rich and wonderful Grace and Mercy of Almighty God, whose hands have made me and fashioned me, and who took me out of my Mothers Womb: that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made me a Man, who might have made me a Beast or other Creature; He hath also by his good Providence preserved the beeing and comfort of my life all the dayes of my Pilgrimage untill now, even for the space of these Sixty five years: During all which time, he hath not suffered me to wam either food or raiment, or the service of any
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:000150_0038_0FA2B30022EB06A0"/>
creature, which hath been requisite for my comfortable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in this World; which I acknowledge to be the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous gift of Him who is Lord of all Creatures, and the High Possessor of Heaven and Earth. Next of all, and more especially I am bound to give Thanks and Praise to Him whilst I have any beeing, that I being a Childe of Wrath by Nature as well as others, and being born in a place of much Profaneness and Popery, he hath of his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace vouchsafed to draw me out of that woful estate of Sin and Ignorance wherein I lay, and to make himself and his Christ known unto me by the Gospel, of which grace I was most unworthy; and in his great patience and mercy to bear with my manifold and great offences; both before and since the time of his gracious Calling of me, though for my unworthy walking in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I might justly have been for ever rejected of him. Yea and such hath been his rich grace, that he hath vouchsafed to put me an unworthy creature into the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Gospel of his Son, that I should not onely know and profess the same (which is unspeakable mercy) but be also a Preacher of it unto others. In which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment if any thing hath been done which hath been pleasing unto him, or any way beneficiall to any Childe of his, it hath not been I that have done the same, but the grace of God which was with me. For I must needs acknowledge to the praise of his Patience and Grace, That in my poor Ministration for the space of these Forty two years and upwards, I have been much defective in Wisdome and Watchfulness over the peoples Souls, in Purity, in Faithfulness, in Uprightness, Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

many other my defects and offences against the Lord, I stand in much need this day of mercy and forgiveness through his Christ, and have no cause to look for any acceptance either in this or in another World, for any Righteousness of my own, either as touching my Ministry or otherwise, but it disclaiming all though: of that kinde, my onely must and hope is to be accepted of him, and (when this life shall end) to be saved in his Heavenly Kingdome meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his Free-grace, and the Obedience and precious Posistion and Intercession of his dear Son.
