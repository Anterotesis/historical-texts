         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Would he not rather have condemn'd it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and exhorted the Soldiers ſpeedily to forſake and abandon it? Surely he had a good Opportunity ſo to do, when he was applied
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006244_0020_10281E234FD20898"/>
to by the Soldiers for Council, but of this he is entirely ſilent.</p>
            <p>Nor did our Lord JESUS rebuke the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> or <hi>Roman Captain,</hi> on account of his military Employment, when he appli'd to him for the Cure of his <hi>ſick</hi> Servant, but commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Faith,</hi> tho' he uſed his <hi>Calling</hi> as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to ſupport it; for, ſaid he, <hi>I alſo am a Man ſet under Authority, having under me Soldiers, and I ſay unto one go and he goeth, and to another, come and he cometh. When</hi> JESUS <hi>heard theſe Things he marveled at him, and ſaid, I have not found ſo</hi> great Faith <hi>no not in</hi> Iſrael.* Had not CHRIST a fair Opportunity to reprove this Man for his military Station, when he mentioned it to him, and made an Argument of it to enforce his Petition, had it been wrong? And yet he ſpeaks not a Word of reprehenſion, but grants the Petition enforc'd by that Argument, and commends the <hi>Faith</hi> encourag'd by it. And does not this fairly imply our LORD'S Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Office, and conſequently of WAR? Can we think that the bleſſed JESUS, whoſe <hi>Words are like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver,</hi>† who always improved every Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity that preſented, to promote the good of thoſe with whom he convers'd, would neglect this, had WAR been againſt his Mind? Or may it be conſiſtently imagined, that infinite Wiſdom and unſpotted.

            <p>But methinks our LORD ſignifies his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> of WAR, more expreſsly elſewhere in theſe Words, <hi>my Kingdom is not of this World, if my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews.</hi>* The Meaning of which is apparently this, That tho' WAR and Fighting is no proper Mean to promote the ſpiritual Kingdom of CHRIST, yet that if the Nature and Deſign of his Humiliation, had permitted him to aſſume a temporal <hi>Crown,</hi> then his Servants ought to fight in Defence of his Perſon and Dignity.

Now can it be thought that WAR ſhould be agreeable to and encourag'd by <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that grand peculiar, and Foundation of the Goſpel, and yet be contrary to it? Can it be thought that the Apoſtle would commend the aforeſaid Wars, as well as the Piety, the Juſtice and Bravery of thoſe concerned in them, without the leaſt Hint of any Alteration in Goſpel-Times in that reſpect, and yet he himſelf of a contrary Sentiment?

            <p>That Saying of the Apoſtle <hi>James, from whence come Wars and Fightings among you, come they not hence, even of your Luſts that war in your Members?</hi>* may be underſtood in this natural and eaſy Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſignify that the original Cauſe of WAR is Evil, becauſe it is always unjuſt upon one Side, and had Man preſerved his original Integrity, there would be no Need of it.

            <p>But it is again objected, that the Apoſtle obſerves to the <hi>Corinthians, that the Weapons of their Warfare were not carnal.</hi>† I anſwer it is true, the Weapons of the Miniſterial and Chriſtian Warfare againſt Sin and Satan are Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, but what then, there is a great Difference between the War we muſt ſuſtain between Sin and Satan, and a War with wicked Men; to pretend to vanquiſh the former by carnal Weapons is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, as to expect a Conqueſt over the latter (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways) without them! It is preſumptuous to expect an End without the Uſe of Means adapted to it: To expect a Crop by the Dint of our Supplications, without plowing, ſowing and fencing our Ground, would be exceeding
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006244_0025_10281E327AA9DE38"/>
fond and vain; and ſo to expect Protection from unreaſonable and violent Men, without uſing proper Meaſures for Defence, on Account of our Piety and Prayers, is equally unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! When proper Means are neglected, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are temporal in temporal Caſes, and we hope for Impunity and Safety, we tempt GOD inſtead of truſting in him. The Juſtice of this, the very Light of Nature only, taught the <hi>Pagans</hi> to acknowledge.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Miniſterial Calling</hi> do not deſtroy, or render unneceſſary the <hi>Magiſtrates Office,</hi> ſo neither do the ſpiritual Arms, which Miniſters and Chriſtians uſe, and with which they fight in the Buſineſs of Religion, render corporal Arms unneceſſary, which the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> uſes and enjoyns?

            <p>Another Objection againſt WAR, is that Propheſy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which ſignifies that under the <hi>Meſſias</hi> Reign, <hi>Men ſhall beat their Swords into Plow-ſhears, and their Spears into pruning Hooks, that Nation ſhall not liſt up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more.</hi>

            <p>BUT leaſt what I have ſaid be miſunderſtood, I wou'd have it obſerv'd, that by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>New-Covenant,</hi> (which are the ſame) we are to underſtand the <hi>glad Tydings</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> thro' the MESSIAH, to be obtain'd by <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Him, (Acts</hi> xx. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 29. <hi>Mark</hi> xxvi. 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxi. 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> viii. 10.) The aforeſaid general Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Nature of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> is agreeable to the current of the Scriptures; and therefore I think it needleſs to mention any more Paſſages at preſent to confirm it.

The <hi>New-Teſtament</hi>-Diſpenſation, is eaſier than the <hi>Old,</hi> being freed from the heavy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Yoke of the <hi>Ceremonial Law, that Hand-Writing of Ordinances is nail'd to the Croſs of</hi> Chriſt. We have now no need of the coſtly and troubleſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrifices, or of their nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ceremonious <hi>waſhings</hi> and <hi>obſervances,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of which were hard to be perform'd.</p>
            <p>I might farther obſerve, that the two aforeſaid <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> differ as to time. The one preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Exhibition of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and the other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it: The one reſpected the <hi>Meſſias</hi> as to come, the other as come actually. Moreover the <hi>Old</hi> was to evaniſh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. but the <hi>New</hi> to continue till the End of Time. <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 16.</p>
