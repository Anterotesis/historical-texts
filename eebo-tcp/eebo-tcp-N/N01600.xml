      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>First. Most Certainly, Sin is <hi>Folly.</hi> How often, how often, has the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> 
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:001901_0048_0FB9CF212C9237A0"/>

               </hi> It may be said of him, as in Prov. V. 23. <hi>In the Greatness of his Folly he goes astray.</hi> And his Confession must be that, 2 Sam. XXIV. 10. <hi>I have sinned in what I have done, and I have done very foolishly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when <hi>Riches</hi> are not <hi>got Honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> they are <hi>got Sinfully.</hi> If they are not got by <hi>Right,</hi> they are got <hi>by Sin.</hi> The Law of the Glorious God is, <hi>Thou shalt not Covet.</hi> But there is an <hi>Evil Coveteousness</hi> in them, who get <hi>Riches, and not by Right.</hi> The Law of the Glorious GOD is, <hi>All things that you would have men do to you, do ye even so to them.</hi> They who <hi>get Riches, and not by Right,</hi> are those, who <hi>do not as they would be done unto.</hi> The Law of the Glorious GOD is, <hi>That no man over-reach, or defraud his Brother in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matter.</hi> They who <hi>get Riches, and not by Right,</hi> are such as <hi>Over-reach</hi> and <hi>Defraud</hi> their Brethren.

               <hi>Man, What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly?</hi> Such Laws of the <hi>Only wise God,</hi> cannot without the most insolent Folly be trampled on.</p>
            <p>But Secondly; If Men will <hi>get Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and not by Right,</hi> Let us enquire, Whether they don't <hi>lose</hi> more than they <hi>get.</hi> If they do so, 'tis most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently an Egregious <hi>Folly</hi> which they are guilty of.

            <p>First; It is an astonishing Truth, and among them that walk in the Ways of <hi>Dishonesty,</hi> it falls down like a flaming <hi>Thunderbolt!</hi>—Foolish Men, All the <hi>Riches</hi> which are not <hi>Honestly gotten,</hi> must be lost in a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck of <hi>Honest Restitution,</hi> if ever Men come unto <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> There is no Man, who <hi>gets Riches and not by Right,</hi> but the <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

unto Salvation,</hi> will bring him to that Language <hi>Zacheus;</hi> LUK. XIX. 8. <hi>Lord, I Restore.</hi> My Friends, 'Tis a tremendous Lesson of Christianity, which I am now treating you withal. Oh! tremble before it. It is, RESTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTION, RESTITUTION; without which all things not <hi>Honestly gotten,</hi> will remain and corrode, as an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Poison in the Soul of the Offender. If you <hi>get Riches and not by Right,</hi> it must be <hi>Repented</hi> of; it must be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented</hi> of: A <hi>Righteous God who loveth Righteousness,</hi> will banish you out of His Kingdom, if it be not <hi>Repented</hi> of. Now, there can be nothing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than this; That if you <hi>Retain</hi> in your hands, what you have <hi>gotten and not by Right,</hi> you do not <hi>Repent</hi> of what you have done. You cannot <hi>Repent,</hi> if you do not Refund unto the utmost of your Capacity. Of a Man who has <hi>got Riches and not by Right,</hi> we are told Job XX. 15. <hi>He hath swallowed down Riches, and he shall vomit them up again, GOD shall cast them out of his Belly.</hi> O 
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001901_0051_0FBA1644843A8118"/>
Unjust Man, look for a terrible Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Either God will by Scourges, make thee throw up thy <hi>Unjust Gain,</hi> and fetch it out of thee by one Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verishing Stroke after another; Or else, He will by <hi>Repentance</hi> dispose thee, to throw it up, with an active, equal, patient <hi>Restitution.</hi> Alas, what hast thou been a doing? A <hi>Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of all thy <hi>Ill-gotten Treasures</hi> must be endeavoured, if thou wouldest not shut thy self out from the Everlasting Mercies of GOD. Ah! How fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, how fatally, how irrecoverably are the Souls of many <hi>Unjust Men</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the <hi>Snares of Death?</hi> They cannot hope to find Favour with GOD, or an Acceptance among true <hi>Paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents,</hi> if they do not endeavour all the <hi>Restitution</hi> that is possible. But will they ever come to this? No, The <hi>Vomit</hi> is too strong for them; they'll sooner dye than come unto it! Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Men; You have at once <hi>lost</hi> all that you have <hi>got!</hi> You must with your own hands throw all <hi>over-board,</hi> if

you would not be <hi>drown'd in Perdition</hi> at the Last!</p>
            <p>Secondly.

XXII. 1. <hi>A good Name is rather to be chosen than great Riches.</hi> 'Tis far more Honourable and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, to be a <hi>Good Man,</hi> than to be a <hi>Rich Man.</hi> It will most of all be found so, in the Day when every Man shall <hi>receive Praise of God,</hi> who is found worthy of it. But now as a <hi>Thief is ashamed when he is found,</hi> so 'tis a <hi>shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Thing to be found a <hi>False-dealer</hi> in any Degree, in any Affair: It makes a Man <hi>lightly esteemed.</hi> All <hi>Baseness</hi> in any Dealing, is a <hi>Blemish</hi> on the <hi>Dealer.</hi> To <hi>Deal unjustly with any Man;</hi> 'tis a Blot in any <hi>Scutcheon.</hi> The Kings themselves that have done it, are of, of what Memory, I beseech you?

Thirdly, Yea, <hi>a Good Conscience</hi> is <hi>Lost.</hi> And that's a worse <hi>Loss,</hi> a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Times; a <hi>Loss</hi> which if we were wise, we should at any time <hi>take Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Spoiling of our Goods,</hi> for the preventing of!

            </p>
            <p>Fourthly; The <hi>Loss</hi> of the SOUL is horribly <hi>Endangered;</hi> Yea, without <hi>Repentance,</hi> the <hi>Danger</hi> is <hi>Unavoidable.</hi> And oh! that the awful words of our SAVIOUR, who knew the <hi>Worth</hi> of a SOUL, were duly considered with us; Mat.

comes at the <hi>End</hi> of an <hi>Unjust Life;</hi> This, This will discover the Matchless <hi>Folly</hi> of all that is not <hi>Honestly</hi> done in and for the Getting of <hi>Riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that <hi>Get Riches and not by Right,</hi> must know, that <hi>this Trade won't Last always.</hi> Their Way, &amp; their Life, must come to an <hi>End.</hi> It won't be Long before they have such Tidings bro't unto them; Ezek VII. 6. <hi>An End is come, the End is come, it watcheth for thee, behold, it is come!</hi> No <hi>Riches</hi> will keep any man always alive.

and behold the False Dealer,</hi> for <hi>the End of that man,</hi> will declare him to be a <hi>Fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First. There is oftentimes, an <hi>Early Death,</hi> in the <hi>Strange Punishment</hi> for these <hi>Workers of Iniquity.</hi> They that <hi>Get Riches, and not by Right,</hi> are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thus <hi>Punished;</hi> They must <hi>Leave them in the midst of their Days.</hi> Thus, we find a <hi>Rich Fool</hi> promising himself <hi>Goods Laid up for many years.</hi> But, <hi>in the midst of his Days</hi> he feels this Order from Heaven served upon him; Luke XII. 20. <hi>Thou Fool, This night thy Soul shall be required of thee; Then whose shall these things be, which thou hast provided:</hi> The man must not Live to Taste the Sweet of his <hi>Ill-gotten Goods.</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the <hi>Wealth</hi> of the Sinner, is Left unto a man more <hi>Just</hi> than himself. GOD required His People to <hi>deal Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously</hi> with one another, and Employed this motive; Deut. XXV. 15. <hi>That thy Days may be lengthened in the Land, which the Lord thy GOD giveth thee.</hi> But in <hi>Unrighteous Dealings,</hi> men take the most Ready Course, that their <hi>Dayes may be Shortened in the Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is especially thus, when men grow 
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001901_0058_0FBA165504561B80"/>
more <hi>Dangerous Criminals,</hi> and are so sharp set with the <hi>Cursed Hunger of Riches,</hi> that they do things wherein <hi>Humane Society</hi> shall be considerably Damnified. Our Gracious GOD has a Wondrous Tenderness for <hi>Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;</hi> And when men grow so Outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous in the Ways of <hi>Dishonesty,</hi> that <hi>Humane Society</hi> suffers Insupportable Damages from them; Now there goes up that Cry to Heaven, <hi>'Tis Time, Lord, for thee to Work!</hi> And, GOD comes down, GOD steps in, GOD in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to <hi>Humane Society,</hi> fulfils that word upon the man who <hi>trusted in the abundance of his Riches, and Strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself in his Wickedness;</hi> Psal. LII. 5. <hi>GOD shall take thee away, and plack thee out of thy Dwelling-place, and Root thee out of the Land of the Living.</hi> Such <hi>Dangerous Criminals</hi> are <hi>Wicked overmuch.</hi> And the Doom of them that are <hi>Wicked overmuch,</hi> is, <hi>To Dy before their Time.</hi> Such <hi>Dangerous Criminals</hi> are Left sometimes to do <hi>Bloody</hi> as well as <hi>Deceitful</hi> Things. And the Doom of such <hi>Bloody and Deceitful men,</hi> is, <hi>They shall not Live out half their Dayes.</hi> Yea, many times

the Wretches run into <hi>Capital Crimes.</hi> It is reckoned among the Crimes of them who are <hi>Greedy of Gain;</hi> Prov. I. 15. <hi>Their feet run to Evil, and make Haste to shed Blood.</hi> The <hi>Sword</hi> which is to defend <hi>Humane Society,</hi> now ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverts upon them. That <hi>Sword</hi> of GOD cuts them off. They <hi>Dy</hi> at the Place of Execution, and <hi>as a Fool dieth.</hi> O dismal Sight! <hi>Young men</hi> drawn to the Place of Execution! <hi>Young men,</hi> who must <hi>flee to the Pit,</hi> and none may <hi>stay them! Young men,</hi> hurried out of the World, for having forfeited their Lives, by <hi>Getting Riches, and not by Right.</hi> Such a <hi>Sight</hi> is this Day to be seen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; <hi>Behold, All ye your selves have seen it!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, But let the <hi>Death</hi> of the Wicked come when it will, be sure it <hi>Scribs</hi> them of all the <hi>Riches</hi> they were Possessed of. The <hi>Riches</hi> which have been <hi>gotten, and not by Right,</hi> many times Leave men before they <hi>Dy.</hi> There is a secret Blast from GOD, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Estates</hi> that have not been <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly</hi> come at. GOD has many Ways to blist Ill gotten Estates, and make such <hi>Treasures of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. At the <hi>Death</hi> of men, and at the <hi>End</hi> of all, it will be found, That SIN <hi>is what nothing is to be gotten by!</hi> To <hi>Sin,</hi> 'Tis to do a <hi>Deceitful Work.
