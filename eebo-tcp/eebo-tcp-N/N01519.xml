            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>THUS ſhe turns all her Amiration and Delight into <hi>an Act of Religious Thanksgiving</hi> to GOD. Something is ſaid of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but more of <hi>God,</hi> by whom he reigned. <hi>He</hi> was made <hi>King,</hi> and ſet on the throne of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to do Judgment and Juſtice. But it was GOD that made him King, and who advanc'd him to the Throne, partly in kindneſs to <hi>Him,</hi> becauſe that he delighted in him; but more in kindneſs to his <hi>People,</hi> becauſe the Lord loved Iſrael for Ever.</p>
            <p>MIND the <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> of this wiſe and <hi>Princely Speech:</hi> which tho' it was the moſt honourable to <hi>Solomon</hi> that cou'd be, yet was void of <hi>Flattery.</hi> Flattery—, No, <hi>Solomon</hi>'s State and Wiſdom were too Great to allow it, and <hi>Her</hi> Noble Heart and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as well as Diſcretion, too High to give it. Her Words are Grave and Solemn, and did in excellent manner <hi>admoniſh Solomon,</hi> that he receiv'd his Crown <hi>from</hi> God; that he was to reign <hi>for</hi> Him; <hi>to</hi> be <hi>Juſt,</hi> ruling
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001805_0005_0FB842C3689C06D0"/>in his fear; that it was from the Undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Love</hi> and Good Will of God towards him that he was Accompliſht for and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Throne from among his Brethren; that what God had done for him was done in favour to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and from his <hi>love</hi> unto them; and finally that He was bound and ſo were others to bleſs &amp; praiſe the LORD his God, and give him all the <hi>Glory</hi> of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to and Eſtabliſhment on his Throne: <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THAT when God raiſes up a wiſe and good KING to do Judgment and Juſtice, it is a ſignal Expreſſion of his delight in Him and of his love unto his People, for which they are highly Obliged to laud and praiſe him.</hi> Or, <hi>That when God delights in a PRINCE to ſet him on the Throne over his People, becauſe he loves them, they are highly obliged to render Him their thankful praiſes.</hi>

BUT was it for <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſake only, or <hi>David</hi>'s either, that God delighted in Him to make him this Wiſe and Good and Great Prince? No, no!

            <p>BUT O the <hi>Ingratitude</hi> to Heaven, the <hi>Profaneſs</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of Providence, in the Vile and Traiterous <hi>Rebellions</hi> lately carried on in <hi>Great Britain!</hi> How have a baſe and ſtupid <hi>Faction,</hi> mindleſs of Gods Wonders and Mercies to the Nation, been <hi>murmuring</hi> firſt and <hi>mutinying,</hi> and then <hi>riſing in Arms</hi> againſt God and his <hi>Anointed!</hi> quarrelling with their Happineſs, weary of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Liberties and Laws, courting Popery and Slavery, rejecting not the <hi>King</hi> ſo much as <hi>God</hi> that He ſhould reign over them, and this by the blackeſt Treacheries, Perjuries, Hypocriſies and Mockery of God. Shall I ſay, the <hi>Queen of the South ſhall riſe up in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001805_0026_0FB842F5F1EB82B0"/>the Judgment againſt this Generation and ſhall condemn them?</hi> that wou'd be too <hi>mild</hi> a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Condemnation of their Villany.</p>
            <p>WHEN I conſider the <hi>Treaſons</hi> that have been acting againſt the King ſince his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to the Throne, and the <hi>horrid Spirit</hi> of the Men that appear againſt his Title, it brings to my mind the words of <hi>David</hi> which he ſpake before the Lord concerning the Enemies of <hi>his Houſe and Family;</hi> Theſe <hi>Sons of Belial</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>are Thorns not to be taken with hands; but the Man that ſhall touch them muſt be fenced with Iron, and the ſtaff of a Spear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O what a doleful <hi>Proſpect</hi> does it afford unto us, if God do not <hi>heal</hi> their Spirit and <hi>change</hi> their Heart! ſhould God <hi>return their Wickedneſs</hi> upon their own heads, even all that their own Heart is <hi>privy to;</hi> tho' the King might be <hi>bleſſed</hi> and his Throne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be Eſtabliſhed before God for ever; yet how are the Convulſions and Confuſions to be <hi>deprecated,</hi> which may be fear'd from that infamous and curſed Spirit of Perfidy and Violence that has already appear'd!</p>
            <p>O might it never be <hi>nam'd</hi> more, to the Infinite Reproach of our <hi>Name</hi> and our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion!</hi> Can <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſo prophanely forget their Religion, and <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſo baſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their Liberties?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001805_0027_0FB842F7408938E8"/>
BUT bleſſed be God that the <hi>whole Body of our United Brethren,</hi> ſo denominated in Great <hi>Britain,</hi> have thro' the Grace of God ſtood firm to a Man unto the Proteſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and been <hi>true</hi> in this day of tryal to <hi>God,</hi> their <hi>King</hi> and their <hi>Country. The Lord ſhow kindneſs and truth unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us continue ſtedfaſt to our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and wait upon God for his further <hi>Mercies</hi> to our King and our Nation and the Proteſtant Intereſt. <hi>My Son fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change.</hi> Let the Apoſtle Peter's Precept and Exhortation to us ſink deep into our hearts: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2, 13—17. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man for the Lord's ſake: whether it be to the King as Supreme: or unto Governours, as unto them that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil doers, &amp; for the praiſe of them that do well. For ſo is the will of God, that with well-doing you may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men: As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as the Servants of God. Honour all Men. Love the Brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the King.</hi>
