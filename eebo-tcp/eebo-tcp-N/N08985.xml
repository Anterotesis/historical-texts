            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Some Account of the Riſe and Progreſs of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Corporation, "for the Relief of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Children of Clergymen, in Communion of the Church of <hi>ENGLAND</hi> in America."</head>
            <p>THE diſtreſſed circumſtances, in which the Epiſcopal Clergy in the more northern provinces of America, and eſpecially the Miſſionaries in the ſervice of the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel, have too frequently been obliged to leave their families, had long been matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to many from entering into the miniſtry of our Church, as well as of regret to pious and worthy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof.</p>
            <p>AFTER ſundry overtures, from time to time, it was at length reſolved, at a meeting of the clergy at Elizabeth-Town, in New-Jerſey, October 1767, to appoint a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to frame ſome plan of proviſion for the diſtreſſed wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and children of ſuch of our clergy as ſhould die in nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or neceſſitous circumſtances. In purſuance of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, the reverend Dr. Auchmuty, Rector of Trinity Church, the reverend Dr. Cooper, Preſident of King's Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, both of New-York, the reverend Mr. Cooke, Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary in Monmouth county, New-Jerſey, and myſelf, met at Perth-Amboy, May 12, 1768; and drew up a ſcheme for the approbation of our brethren; recommending it to them to ſollicit charters in each of the three provinces of New-York, New-Jerſey and Pennſylvania, that we might be a body corporate, in which ever of theſe provinces we might have occaſion to meet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:011469_0004_0F83301953E0A750"/>THIS ſcheme having obtained the approbation of ſeveral ſucceeding meetings of the clergy, and a draft of a charter being ſettled, two perſons were appointed in each province to ſollicit the paſſing thereof; viz. the reverend Dr. Auch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muty, and Dr. Cooper, in New-York; the reverend Mr. Cooke, and Mr. Odell, in New-Jerſey; and the reverend Mr. Peters <note n="*" place="bottom">Rector of Chriſt-Church and St. Peters, Philadelphia.</note>, and myſelf, in Pennſylvania. And juſtice requires, that the moſt public and grateful teſtimony ſhould be given of that readineſs and cheerfulneſs, with which the ſeveral Governors conſented to the grant of the charters in their reſpective provinces.</p>
            <p>THE charter for Pennſylvania was obtained the 7th of February laſt; the honorable JOHN PENN, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, having ordered the ſeal to be put to it on the firſt application. And the worthy and honorable Proprietaries of the province, as ſoon as the deſign was made known to them in London, took the earlieſt opportunity to ſignify their hearty approbation of it, and wiſhes for its ſucceſs. His Excellency, Governor FRANKLIN, ſhewed the ſame readineſs, and the charter for New-Jerſey was compleated in May. That for New-York, altho' cheerfully aſſented to by his Excellency Sir HENRY MOORE, Baronet, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed by his indiſpoſition and death; but the paſſing it was one of the firſt acts of his ſucceſſor, the honorable Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governor COLDEN, who put the ſeal to it, the 29th of September laſt.</p>
            <p>AS it will be of uſe, to the members of the corporation eſpecially, that each of them ſhould have a copy of their charters to have recourſe to, as occaſion may require, I ſhall here inſert that for New-York; not meaning thereby any other preference than what is uſually claimed by that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, in virtue of ſeniority, among her ſiſter ones.</p>

            <p>As the firſt meeting appointed by each charter, was to be on the Tueſday and Wedneſday next following the Feaſt of St. Michael, 1769, which were the 3d and 4th of this preſent October; moſt of the Clerical, and ſundry of the Lay Members, met accordingly at Burlington, in New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, on Tueſday, October 3d; and the Preſident having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the chair, the different Charters were read, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with each other.</p>
            <p>ON the day following, the members who were met, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 19 in Number, preſented an Addreſs of Thanks to his Excellency Governor FRANKLIN, which he anſwered with the warmeſt wiſhes for the ſucceſs of the pious deſign for which the corporation had been erected; and added, that it would always give him pleaſure to render any acceptable ſervice to the members or the Church of England.</p>

            <p>FINDING that a majority of the members of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration could not be conveniently convened at Burlington, to enact Fundamental Rules, agreeable to the tenor of the Charters, it was ſound neceſſary to proceed to Philadelphia, without breaking up; and a committee was appointed to have all the neceſſary papers in readineſs.

            <p>IT is from no affectation of ſingularity, that I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced this diſcourſe to you, with Sundry texts of ſcripture, inſtead of One; but to ſhew how rich are the ſacred oracles of God, as in exalted leſſons of BENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOLENCE in general, ſo particularly that amiable branch
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011469_0014_0F833023202314D0"/>
thereof which I am to recommend to your preſent regard. Thro' the whole inſpired books of the Old Teſtament, as well as the New, we ſhall ſcarce find a writer that hath not made the cauſe of the FATHERLESS and WIDOWS peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly his own.</p>
            <p>AMIDST a very imperfect ſyſtem of Morality, even in the Heathen-world, the voice of God, ſpeaking in the hearts of men, had carried their Leſſons of Benevolence to a more exalted pitch, than moſt other branches of their Doctrine; in ſo much, that ſome of their Sages could embrace, in the calm Wiſh of PHILANTHROPY, the whole <note n="*" place="bottom">Homo ſum; humani nihil a me alienum puto.</note> human ſpecies.</p>
            <p>BUT it was from the Scriptures of GOD, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the divine Documents of our SAVIOUR and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, that the doctrine of UNIVERSAL LOVE AND CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY, received its finiſhing luſtre, and was placed on its true foundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Altho' the motives to this heavenly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be ſtrong, both in the Old and New-Teſtament, yet are they carried infinitely farther in the Latter, and preſſed home upon nobler and more animating principles.</p>
            <p>TRUE it is, that no writer can expreſs a more amiable Spirit of Benevolence, nor recount his acts of Mercy and Kindneſs, with more conſcious delight and complacency, than the author of the book of Job; as well in the paſſage before us, as elſewhere—</p>
            <p>
               <q>WHEN the ear heard me, then it bleſſed me; when the eye ſaw me, then it gave witneſs to me</q>—and why? <q>BECAUSE I delivered the Poor that cried, and the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERLESS, and him that had none to help him. The bleſſing of him that was ready to periſh came upon me, and I cauſed the WIDOW's heart to ſing for joy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE principles upon which he acted in all this, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be underſtood from what he ſays afterwards—</p>
            <p>FOR—<q>If I have withheld the Poor from their deſire, or cauſed the eyes of the WIDOW to fail; if I have eaten
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011469_0015_0F833023F7908878"/>
my morſel myſelf alone, and the FATHERLESS hath not eaten thereof; if I have ſeen any periſh for want of cloathing, or any Poor without covering, and his loins have not bleſſed me—and he were not warmed with the fleece of my ſheep—If I have made Gold my hope, or have ſaid to the fine Gold, thou art my confidence—this were an Iniquity to be puniſhed by the Judge; for I ſhould have denied that God is above <note n="*" place="bottom">Job xxxi. 16—28.</note>.</q>—</p>
            <p>SO that the ſum of his argument ſeems to amount juſt to this—That if out of the Good Things wherewith my Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator hath abundantly bleſſed me, I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to communicate and provide for the Deſtitute, I ſhould be worthy of the higheſt puniſhment. For this would be, in effect, to claim all thoſe things as my own abſolute and perfect property, which are only given me in truſt by my benevolent Maker. It would be denying that the Almighty reigns in heaven Above, the ſole and abſolute ſource of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing we enjoy here Below. In ſuch caſe, juſtly might He re-claim his own, ſtrip me of all his bounty hath given me, turn me naked into the world, leave the wife of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom deſtitute, and my children, in their turn, to beg in vain for that bread which my unfeeling heart refuſed to others.</p>
            <p>SCARCE any higher than this will the Old Teſtament do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments of Love and Beneficence be found to run; and no ſmall height it is—but founded, however, on arguments of Almighty juſtice and judgment, ſeemingly reaching no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to ſecure the divine favour in this world. Whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this ſtrain is the language of the old law itſelf—</p>
            <p>
               <q>YE ſhall not afflict any WIDOW OF FATHERLESS CHILD; for if ye afflict them in any wiſe, and they cry unto me, I will hear their cry, and my Wrath ſhall wax hot, and I will kill you with the Sword; and YOUR WIVES ſhall be WIDOWS, and Your Children FATHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESS <note n="†" place="bottom">Exod. xxii. 22.</note>.</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:011469_0016_0F8330249F099A38"/>SUCH denounciations of Wrath and Puniſhment, like the Thunderings and Burnings of the Mount, were ſuited to bend and awe the hearts of a people, whoſe Genius was too groſs and ſervile, or too ſtubborn, to be woo'd and won by the ſoft breathings of Everlaſting LOVE. And here the danger was, that attentive only to the Letter of the Law, and its awful Sanctions, but not diſcerning its divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the outward offices of LOVE and BENEFICENCE, might be fulfilled from Carnal motives—to ſecure the Divine fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in this world—as conſidering that the more liberally they might give, the more liberally they would be ſupplied, of God's infinite bounty. Or the fond Praiſe of Men might be no ſmall motive—that <q>the ear which heard them might bleſs them, and the eye which ſaw them, bear witneſs to their good deeds.</q>—</p>
            <p>OF this Spirit were thoſe who affected <q>to beſtow their Alms before men.</q> But when JESUS CHRIST came to give a more noble foundation to the Law of LOVE and CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY, this Oſtentatious Spirit met with his early reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Altho' he did not annul the Old Teſtament motives to Love and Alms-giving, he added new ones, infinitely more powerful and animating. He placed Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality before us. He taught us that we were Candidates for an Eternity of Glory, which none could be fit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit, but they who, having the LOVE OF GOD ſhed abroad in their Hearts, did, for his ſake, Love all his CREATURES, and prepare their Souls for the final enjoyment of Him, thro' the conſtant exerciſe of every act of Kindneſs and Mercy here below. And in the rapturous glimpſes he gives us of this future and eternal bliſs, and of that awful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and ſentence which is to fix the doom of mankind— CHARITY to the Poor, the Sick, and the Needy, is made the grand Preparation of the Heart, for all that we can hope to enjoy from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:011469_0017_0F83302557809DE8"/>NOR was it by Doctrines alone, but by conſtant and liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Example, that this heavenly Temper was inculcated by Him. As his Errand into the world was at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by choirs of Angels to be <q>Glory to GOD on high, with Peace and GOOD-WILL to Men on earth</q>—ſo GOOD-WILL to Men was the leading principle of his whole life; which was at laſt cloſed with an act of GOOD-WILL ſo ſtupenduouſly great, that both Men and Angels were left aſtoniſhed at the Benevolence thereof—For <hi>he died to ſave ſinners</hi>—He breathed out his laſt in <q>LOVE which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth knowledge <note n="‡" place="bottom">Epheſ. iii. 19.</note>,</q>—conſtituting LOVE as the grand criterion, whereby all who ſhould afterwards profeſs his name, might be truly known <note n="§" place="bottom">John xiii. 35.</note> as his.</p>
            <p>IN this evangelic view, well might LOVE be ſtiled a New Law; as founded not in a mere Regard to almighty Juſtice, or Fear of almighty Judgment; but in a Heart that is caſt into the very Mold of LOVE itſelf—in a Temper that is Angelic, nay, even Seraphic, Godlike, Divine, and alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo raiſed above this world, as to be daily ripening for the world to come!</p>
            <p>FOLLOWING this Doctrine of LOVE, given by our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed SAVIOUR, nay, Living in it, and Feeling it in all its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine efficacy, his faithful Apoſtles conſtantly preſſed it home to men, upon his own heavenly principles. Thus we find St. James, in the Text read to you, placing all Religion in a Heart thus ſet looſe to the world—thus breathing the dictates of Humanity and Love.</p>
            <p>
               <q>PURE Religion, and undefiled before God (our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our) and the Father, is This—To viſit the FATHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESS and WIDOWS in their affliction, and to keep our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unſpotted from the world.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the fervent Apoſtle St. Paul, of all others, with his uſual zeal, enters the fulleſt into this ſubject. His 12th and 13th chapters to the Corinthians, are one continued
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011469_0018_0F83302615AF2D90"/>
lecture on our SAVIOUR's heavenly Doctrine of CHARITY; which, by a ſublime train of argument, he exalts above all other Virtues and Graces—even above thoſe truly Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Ones—FAITH and HOPE.</p>
            <p>IF therefore, we would wiſh to underſtand this eſſential Doctrine aright, and to be truly actuated by the Life and Spirit of Heavenly Love, a ſhort analyſis of our Apoſtle's arguments, will be of the utmoſt uſe; and alſo be the beſt introduction I can give to the recommendation of that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Branch of Charity; for which I have the honor to be appointed an humble advocate before you.</p>
            <p>THERE had ſtarted up, in the Church of Corinth (as there hath, alas! in many churches ſince) a ſett of men, who being elated with an over-weening conceit of their own Spiritual Gifts—the ſtrength of their FAITH, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of their HOPE, in Chriſt Jeſus—made that a plea for lording it over their brethren; and for Spiritual Pride, raſh Condemnation, and cenſorious contempt of others; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that thoſe endowed with ſuperior Gifts and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, were as the Head, Heart, and Vital parts of the Body, while others were as the meaner Members.</p>
            <p>SAINT Paul attacks them on their own Principles; and, by a beautiful Alluſion to the Body Natural, proves that Chriſtians of lower attainments, were as much members of Chriſt's Myſtical body, as thoſe of the higheſt; and that to condemn or judge uncharitably of them, was as much a Schiſm in the Body Myſtical, as if in the Body Natural, <q>the Foot ſhould ſay, becauſe I am not the Hand; and the Ear, becauſe I am not the Eye—that therefore, they are not of the Body. For if the whole were an Eye, where were the Hearing? If the whole were Hearing, where were the Smelling?</q>
            </p>
            <p>JUST ſo in the Body Myſtical. <q>Are all Apoſtles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers? are all Workers of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles? Have all the Gifts of Healing? Do all ſpeak with Tongues? Do all Interpret?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:011469_0019_0F833026E2CCA160"/>YOU do well, ſays he, to covet earneſtly theſe "beſt of Gifts." But, would you have the true Spirit of your Maſter CHRIST, and be his Followers indeed?—Behold, I will ſhew you "A MORE EXCELLENT WAY," than that of ſtriving to make yourſelves great by Boaſting of any your own Acquiſitions, however eminent.</p>
            <p>HE then begins his divine Sermon on CHARITY; and ſurely, my Brethren, he could not have delivered himſelf with a more glorious and fervent Zeal, had he lived to ſee thoſe fiercer Contentions, that Havock and Deſtruction, which the want of this Goſpel-virtue of CHARITY hath introduced into modern times—that Spirit of Bitterneſs and Violence; that Thirſt of Imperiouſneſs and Dominion; that preſumptuous Cenſure and religious Railing; that Strife for modes and opinions, uneſſential to Chriſtianity; that Deſire of obtruding our own diſtinguiſhing Tenets on thoſe around us, rather than the common Commandments of CHRIST; that Earneſtneſs of Compelling their FAITH, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than provoking their LOVE and OBEDIENCE by our good example—all which unchriſtian Temper hath been, like the worm at the root of Jonah's Gourd, eating out the very Vitals of Religion; and hath often made this world more like an Aceldama, or field of Blood, than the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heritage of the meek and lowly Jeſus. For moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, from ſad experience, that when once this Temper begins to prevail, not only the LOVE OF GOD is forgotten, but along with it the LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOURS alſo; and the Heart, by Habits of Bitterneſs, Cenſoriouſneſs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, Violence and Revenge, becomes gradually call us, and dead to all the ſofter impreſſions of Humanity, Mercy and Good-will.</p>
            <p>SAINT Paul, determined to give an early check to this growing evil in the Churches, attacks it with an undaunted firmneſs, and truly Apoſtolic ardor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:011469_0020_0F833027A4740030"/>SUPPOSE, ſays he, that you had all thoſe Gifts and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, whereof you ſo fondly glory—ſuppoſe your Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſo great, that you could ſpeak with the tongues of Men and Angels; your Knowledge ſo enlarged, that you could underſtand all Myſteries, and interpret all Difficulties; your deſire of Alms-giving ſuch, that you could beſtow all your Goods to feed the Poor; your Mortification to the world ſo ſtrong, that you had ſubdued all carnal appetites; your FAITH ſufficient even to remove mountains; your HOPE in CHRIST ſo fervent, that you could give your Bodies to be burnt for the Truth of his Doctrines—Yet, for all this, I tell you, that "if you have not CHARITY, you are NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THING!" All theſe Gifts and Acquiſitions—all theſe good Deeds—are of no eſtimation in the ſight of GOD, if they are not miniſterial to that LOVE which is the fulfilling of the whole Law; and are not performed in <q>that more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Way of CHARITY,</q> which is the Spirit of the Goſpel, and the very badge of Chriſtian Perfection!</p>
            <p>FOR Eloquence, employed to puff up the vanity of the poſſeſſor, and not exerted, in the ſpirit of Love and Truth, to propagate Univerſal Holineſs, "is but as the ſounding Braſs, and tinkling Cymbal."</p>
            <p>ALMS-GIVINGS, Mortifications, Zeal for Doctrines, or Zeal againſt them, ſanctimonious Appearances, the moſt conſummate Knowledge—all of them are dead and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, if not accompanied with the unfeigned LOVE of God and our Neighbour. Nay, even the divine virtues of FAITH and HOPE are fruitleſs, unleſs productive of CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY, which is Greater than They!</p>
            <p>BUT altho' this vaſt preheminence is given to CHARITY over FAITH and HOPE, let us not think that St. Paul meant to derogate from the latter. On the contrary, he every where magnifies Them, that CHARITY, on the Compariſon, may appear the more illuſtrious. And in this very place, he paints before us, in the ſtrongeſt colours, the FAITH and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011469_0021_0F83302856086180"/>
HOPE of Abraham, of Moſes, the Patriarchs, and firſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; ſhewing that, by theſe divine Graces, they were led to perſevere in Love and Obedience thro' all the trials of life.—</p>
            <p>WOULD we truly know the Apoſtle's diſtinction on this head, methinks it may be rendered obvious in a few words, however needleſly perplexed it hath been.</p>
            <p>FAITH and HOPE with him are indeed ever made the foundations of true RELIGION. But LOVE is the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure; or it is Religion itſelf, in all its perfection and glory. FAITH, in his comprehenſive language, is the <q>Subſtance of Things Hoped for, the Evidence of Things not ſeen</q>—That is to ſay—a ſtrong Belief in the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perfections of God, and in the worth and reality of Inviſible things—a Belief that as his Veracity hath never failed us in the Paſt, ſo neither will it fail in the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of thoſe glorious Future Things which he hath promiſed, altho' they may be too high and mighty for our preſent Comprehenſion. And thus thoſe future Inviſible things become Evidenced to us, and preſented before us, as if already enjoyed in Subſtance and Reality; leading us to lay hold of Chriſt as offered to us in the goſpel; all which is connected with, or neceſſarily productive of, the next divine grace and virtue, ſtiled by our Apoſtle HOPE, or "the HOPE of Righteouſneſs by FAITH"—a firm and joyous Confidence, that our ſincere, tho' imperfect, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices will be accepted thro' Him, inſtead of that unſinning Obedience required by the ſtrict tenor of the Law; and that we ſhall be Juſtified, Sanctified, and finally Saved by coming to God, in this <hi>"new and living way."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW, can ſuch Views of God's Goodneſs as theſe, be without LOVE? Or would theſe views be of any uſe at all, but for leading us to that LOVE, which begets Obedience and Conformity to what is ſo Lovely and Venerable?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:011469_0022_0F83302914CFB2A0"/>JUSTLY therefore is this living FAITH ſtiled the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of that EVANGELIC Religion, whoſe eſſence is LOVE. For ſurely we cannot have LOVE to Him in whom we have not HOPE; nor have HOPE in Him in whom we have not BELIEVED. But ſtill, if our FAITH and HOPE were to ſtop ſhort of LOVE and OBEDIENCE, they would be of no value; for Love and Obedience are their end; and are the only perfections that can aſſimilate us to Angels, or in any wiſe make us fit for that heavenly Communion, Where LOVE is to conſtitute our eternal Felicity.</p>
            <p>THUS, my brethren, I have endeavoured, as briefly as I could, to ſtate St. Paul's great argument for the Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence given to CHARITY. And, I truſt, what hath been ſaid, will not be deemed a deviation from my ſubject. For it was my expreſs purpoſe, by taking a Text from both Teſtaments, to ſhew how infinitely more powerful are the Motives to LOVE and Beneficence, under the New than the Old covenant; and that, therefore, if we do not ſhine ſuperior in all acts of Love and Mercy, under ſo Loving and Merciful a Diſpenſation; even the men of Nineveh, and the Queen of the South, ſhall riſe in judgment againſt us—ſeeing neither Jew nor Gentile, before the coming of CHRIST, had thoſe gracious and tender Calls to LOVE, Which the Goſpel is now conſtantly ſounding in our ear!</p>
            <p>YE Sages! ye Rabbi's! ye venerable names of antiquity! we honor you for your Leſſons of Benevolence; and rather bluſh for ourſelves that you proceeded ſo far, than wonder that your progreſs was no greater.</p>
            <p>YET ſay, O thou JEW, whoever thou wert, in antient times, whoſe heart was made to glow for thy ſpecies, on the principles of thine own Law—ſay, what would have been thy raptures of Benevolence, hadſt thou known the true Meſſiah, and been tutored in his mild and evangelic doctrines of Love?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:011469_0023_0F833029E754E0D0"/>SAY alſo, thou GENTILE-SAGE! whoever thou wert, that by conſidering God only as the common Creator, and all Men as the work of his hands, couldſt from thence infer the duties of Mutual Love among the whole ſpecies—ſay further, whoever thou wert, that, by beholding His ſtars in the firmament mix their friendly rays in aid of each other, couldſt from thence conclude, that all his creatures here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ought to mingle in like friendly offices—ſay, how would thy ſoul have been enflamed towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man, had any Star or Conſtellation, in all thy Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, pointed <note n="§" place="bottom">See a thought ſomewhat to this purpoſe in Hartley, Serm. 7th.</note> to Chriſt the Power of God, dying in an Act of LOVE to thee—nay, ſetting LOVE before thee, as his laſt great Command, and the ſum total of everlaſting bliſs?</p>
            <p>BUT here thy perſpective was limited—where (bleſſed be God) ours is infinitely extended; for CHARITY (to crown our Apoſtle's eulogium on it) never Faileth, but endureth for ever: It hath a place among the perfections of God, which neither FAITH nor HOPE can have; ſince, where all is pure VISION, there can be no exerciſe for FAITH; nor, where all is perfect FRUITION, can there be room for HOPE. Our FAITH and HOPE can give us no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of God; but our CHRITY makes us, in ſome ſort, what He himſelf is in a Superlative manner—the Helpers of the Helpleſs, and partakers of his own joy in beholding a happy world! Our FAITH and HOPE may ſerve us as the Handmaids of LOVE here below; but leaving them behind us, as of no further uſe, our LOVE is all that we ſhall carry hence with us, as our Dowery from Earth to Heaven!</p>
            <p>AS yonder majeſtic <note n="*" place="bottom">One of the largeſt rivers in North-America, on which the city of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia ſtands.</note> Delaware is fed and ſupported in its courſe, by tributary rills and ſprings flowing from each mountain's ſide, till at length it comes to mix its waters
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011469_0024_0F83302A925E1660"/>
with its Parent Ocean, where it no longer ſtands in need of their ſcanty ſupplies; ſo FAITH and HOPE are the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Springs of our LOVE in our journey Heaven-wards; but when once arrived there, we ſhall no longer ſtand in need of their Aid. <q>When that which is Perfect is come, that which is in Part ſhall be done away.</q> Our FAITH ſhall be ſwallowed up in VISION, and our HOPE in FRUITION; but our CHARITY and LOVE ſhall remain for ever, mixing and blending in the unbounded ocean of PARENTAL and ETERNAL LOVE!</p>
            <p>O CHARITY, thou heaven-born Virtue! Can the tongues of Men, or even of Angels, ſpeak more excellent things of thee? Or can a more tranſcendent rank be now aſſigned thee—than, that the Saviour of the world hath thus made thee the badge of Chriſtian perfection; and his inſpired followers have enthroned thee as the Queen of all Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Graces and Virtues; declaring, that neither the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr's zeal, nor the ſelf-denial of the Saint, nor all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, nor all Knowledge, nor any Virtue beſides, can profit or adorn the man any thing, who is unadorned with thy ſweet celeſtial garb! But he who is thus adorned, is the moſt auguſt ſpectacle upon earth—whom even Angels ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey with delight, as cloathed in that peculiar garb, which Chriſt himſelf vouchſafed to wear here below, and which ſhall not need to be put off in Heaven above.</p>
            <p>WE ſee, then, my brethren, that Goſpel-Charity, thus explained, includes in it almoſt unſpeakable things; its ſhorteſt character, to ſum up all in a few words, being no leſs than this—</p>
            <p>"An ardent and ſeraphic LOVE OF GOD, grafted in a ſtedfaſt Belief of his adorable Attributes, a firm Reliance on the goodneſs and juſtice of his Moral Government, a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous and comprehenſive view of his ſcheme of Providence, a Heart thoroughly touched and melted with that aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Plan of Love manifeſted in Chriſt, and a Mind
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011469_0025_0F83302B58D7B9D8"/>
darting forward to thoſe everlaſting ſcenes of bliſs promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thro' him, in a well grounded and triumphant Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſure accompliſhment. Now the true LOVE OF GOD, founded on ſuch exalted principles as theſe, cannot but be accompanied with the ſecond branch of Goſpel-Charity, the LOVE OF OUR NEIGHBOUR alſo—engaging us in an affectionate Concern for the welfare of our Whole Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, with a quick and pervading Senſe of all the Good or Evil that can befal them in this world; conſidering them as Brethren—made by the ſame PARENT-GOD; Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame SAVIOUR-JESUS; travelling together to the ſame heavenly Country, and commanded to alleviate each others burdens, "and not to fall out by the way."</p>
            <p>TO you then, who have this juſt conception of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Goſpel-Charity, and have the true Love of God, and of Mankind, reigning in your hearts, my intended Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be eaſy. For if all acts of Love and Beneficence, ſo far as our abilities and opportunities reach, be branches of this heavenly virtue, I have the authority of Scripture to ſay, that the Cauſe of the FATHERLESS and WIDOWS, claims a primary and moſt ſpecial regard.</p>
            <p>IN the Text, taken from Jeremiah, the Almighty himſelf, in the midſt of the ſevereſt denounciations againſt a rebellious people, yet ſeems to relent in mercy towards the FATHERLESS and WIDOWS—<q>Leave thy FATHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESS CHILDREN, I will preſerve them alive; and let thy WIDOWS truſt in me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER the Law, remarkable was the attention paid to the STRANGER, the FATHERLESS, and the WIDOW. <q>When thou cutteſt down thine Harveſt, and haſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a Sheaf in the field, thou ſhalt not go to fetch it— it ſhall be for the STRANGER, the FATHERLESS, and the WIDOW—when thou beateſt thine Olive-tree, thou ſhalt not go over the boughs again—when thou gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the Grapes of thy Vineyard, thou ſhalt not glean it
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011469_0026_0F83302C1F8F1230"/>
afterwards—it ſhall be for the STRANGER, the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERLESS, and the WIDOW <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xxiv, 19—21.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>EVEN David, altho' he reſiſted his own natural affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and continued inexorable to the recal of a favourite Son, who had offended him, yet could not withſtand thoſe mournful accents of the WIDOW of Tekoah—<q>Help. O King—I am indeed a WIDOW-WOMAN, and my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is Dead</q>—</p>
            <p>THE ſtory is truly tender, tho' feigned. And if this WIDOW's Apparent Diſtreſs could procure an oath of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, that a hair of her ſon (whoſe life was forfeited to the public) ſhould not fall to the ground, only by pleading, that if this ſon was loſt, <q>her coal, which was alive, would be quenched, and neither name nor remainder be left to her huſband on earth</q>—I ſay, if this ſtory of Feigned Diſtreſs could ſo far prevail, ſurely the voice of Real Diſtreſs will have a ſtill greater influence—the voice of WIDOWS indeed! not pleading for lives forfeited to the law, but for Themſelves, and their Children—for the Names and Remainders of your own Clergy, that they may not be wholly loſt upon earth—the Names and Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of men, who have once been your dear Friends in CHRIST-JESUS; men who, in their life-time, have adminiſtered to you heavenly Counſel, and ſweet Comfort, in his precious Word and Covenant; and men who may have often opened your Souls to flow in thoſe godlike ſtreams of Benevolence and Charity to others, wherewith thoſe Helpleſs Remainders of themſelves now ſtand in need to be relieved and refreſhed at your hands.</p>
            <p>MANY words are not needful to explain the nature and propriety of ſuch a Charity as this, nor need I mention the long Call there hath been for its eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>YOU well know the ſituation and circumſtances of the Clergy of the Church of England, in theſe Northern Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011469_0027_0F83302CDEC6CCA8"/>
for the Relief of whoſe families, when left in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, this deſign is more particularly ſet on foot. Except in a few places, their chief ſupport depends on the Bounty of our fellow-members of the Church in Great-Britain; and that venerable Society, who have the Diſtribution of this bounty, have of late been obliged, and will be ſtill more obliged, to retrench their allowance; that, like faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Stewards, they may be likewiſe able to reach out their helping hand to thoſe numerous Petitioners for New Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which ariſe from the conſtant encreaſe of People in theſe Colonies.</p>
            <p>THE additional Support which our Clergy receive from their Congregations, is generally ſmall, and exceedingly precarious; decreaſing ſometimes in Nominal, often in Real value; while the expence of every Neceſſary in life is proportionably encreaſing.</p>
            <p>DECENCY, a regard to Character, to their own Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the credit of Religion, and even your Credit, among whom they miniſter, require them to maintain ſome ſort of Figure in their families, above thoſe in common profeſſions and buſineſs; while, certain it is, on the other hand, that any ſober reputable Tradeſman, can turn his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to more account than They.</p>
            <p>THE like regard to Decency and character alſo forbids our Clergy to follow any Secular employ, in aid of their circumſtances; unleſs, perhaps, here and there one, by Education, ſhould have been qualified for ſome Practice in the Healing Art of Medicine, which is not deemed incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the Paſtoral duty, where it is not too large.</p>
            <p>ON the whole, this I will venture to aſſert, that were the generality of our Clergy to make their calculation according to the way of the world, the money <note n="*" place="bottom">The money expended this way can ſcarce be eſtimated at much leſs than £ 500 ſterling, and many of our miſſionary clergy do not receive £ 30 ſterling per annum from their congregations, ſome not more than half that ſum, and not a great number much above it.</note> expended in their education at Schools and Colleges, a Voyage for Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011469_0028_0F83302DA4531A50"/>
and the purchaſe of neceſſary books (if it had been laid out at firſt as a common Capital at Intereſt) would bring them a greater annual return, without any trouble or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, either of Body or Mind, than they can procure by the labour of their whole lives, in diſcharge of their paſtoral duty, excluſive of the Bounty of benevolent perſons in the mother country.</p>
            <p>I AM far from mentioning theſe things as Complaints; I know they are of Neceſſity in many places; and I truſt none of my brethren among the Clergy will ever make their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation in this way; but keep their Eye on their MASTER's Service, looking forward to the "Recompence of Reward." Yet what I mention is ſo far neceſſary, as it ſhews inconteſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the great propriety of the deſign before us.</p>
            <p>IT certainly requires little attention to what paſſes around us, to ſee that the families of our deceaſed Clergy are often left among the moſt diſtreſſed in their vicinity. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by ſtrict oeconomy, and good Example, may be able to ſupport them in ſome degree of Reputation, during his own Life, altho' not to flatter them with the hopes of any Patrimony at his death. By his own Care, and ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of Schools, he may give the Sons the rudiments of an Education for his own profeſſion, or ſome other uſeful one in the world. The Mother, with the like anxious Care, and fond Hopes of rendering the Daughters reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among their Sex, may employ her late and early toil to train their Minds to thoſe virtues, and their Hands to that Diligence and Induſtry, which might one day make them the ſweet accompliſhed companions of worthy men in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life.—</p>
            <p>BUT alas! amidſt all theſe flattering dreams and fond pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the heart, the Father, perhaps in his prime of years and uſefulneſs, is called from this world. The Prop and Stay of all this promiſing Family is now no more! His Life was their whole dependence, under God, even for daily
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011469_0029_0F83302E66582980"/>
Bread! His Death leaves them almoſt deſtitute—deſtitute, alas! not of Bread only, but even of Council and Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon earth!</p>
            <p>FATAL reverſe—Ah! little do the world in general, and eſpecially they who baſk in the eaſy ſunſhine of afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and proſperity—little do they know the various com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated ſcenes of private anguiſh and diſtreſs—Here they are various and complicated indeed!</p>
            <p>THE Bereaved and Diſconſolate MOTHER, as ſoon as Chriſtian Reflection begins to dry up her tears a little, finds them wrung from her afreſh by the melancholy Taſk that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to her. She is now, alas! to reduce the once flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes of her tender Family, to the ſtandard of their preſent ſad and humbled condition! Hard Taſk indeed! The Son is to be told that he muſt no more aſpire to reach the ſtation which his Father filled; and the Daughter is to learn that, in this hard and ſelfiſh world, ſhe muſt no longer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to become the Wife of him, to whom ſhe once might have looked on terms of equality—The Son, perhaps, muſt deſcend to ſome Manual employ, while even the poor pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance neceſſary to ſettle him in That, is not to be found; and the Daughter muſt ſerve ſtrangers, or be yoked perhaps in Marriage for Mere Bread; while the mournful mother (without the ſlow-procured help of Friends) can ſcarce fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh out the decent Wedding-garment!</p>
            <p>WHAT did I ſay? the decent Wedding-garment, and a Marriage for Mere Bread? This were an Iſſue of troubles devoutly to be wiſhed for!—But, ah me! The Snares of POVERTY in a Mind once bred up above it—ſhall every unguarded unprotected Female be able to eſcape them? Alas! no—Some VILLAIN-DECEIVER, with Vows and broken Oaths, with LOVE in his Mouth, and HELL in his Heart, taking advantage of Innocence in Diſtreſs, lays his ſcheme of deſtruction ſure; and with the ruin of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011469_0030_0F83302F1684D8C8"/>
brings the Mother's grey hairs down to the grave with accumulated ſorrow!</p>
            <p>JUST, but indignant, Heaven! Is there no choſen Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in this World, to heap on the heads of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious monſters, to SAVE them from that Vengeance, which they have merited, tho' yet we dare not wiſh them, in the World to come!</p>
            <p>THIS ſad part of the Cataſtrophe of many Females, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from fathers, once venerable and pious in their day, we would willingly have paſſed over in ſilence; were not the experience of what has happened in other countries, more than ſufficient to awaken our apprehenſions in this.</p>
            <p>THE picture here drawn, is no exaggerated one; and when the Children of Clergy, in low circumſtances, are in an early age deprived of both Parents—then are they OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHANS indeed! and every diſtreſs, every temptation, falls upon them, with aggravated weight!</p>
            <p>TO be FATHERS, then, to ſuch FATHERLESS CHIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DREN; to take them by the hand, and lead them out, thro' the ſnares of the world, into ſome public Uſefulneſs in life, that the Name and Memorial of our dear Brethren and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Paſtors deceaſed, may not be wholly loſt upon earth— I ſay, to DO THIS, and give ſome Gleams of comfort to the afflicted WIDOWS and MOTHERS that ſurvive—muſt ſurely be one of the moſt delightful Actions of a BENEVO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LENT Mind; and THIS, my brethren, is the glorious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the CHARITY for which we are Incorporated, and which we have undertaken to ſollicit and conduct.</p>
            <p>BLESSED, therefore, be all they in this world and the next (Laity and Clergy) into whoſe Hearts God hath put it, to aſſociate for ſo noble and pious a purpoſe. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, may that venerable Society in England be bleſſed, whoſe annual Subſcription hath laid ſo liberal a Foundation for the work; and bleſſed alſo be thoſe Governors of Provinces,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011469_0031_0F8330305B589470"/>
who have ſo cheerfully and readily given us their Charters for carrying it into execution!</p>
            <p>HAPPY in ſuch Beginnings and ſuch Countenance, let us ſet ourſelves earneſtly to the diſcharge of our Part; leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Iſſue to GOD, and the Benevolence of good Men.</p>
            <p>SOME <note n="*" place="bottom">I have reaſon to think that ſuch perſons are far from a majority of any deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. Many of all perſuaſions have expreſſed their hearty wiſhes for the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the deſign; and I am particularly bound to acknowledge the ready aſſiſtance received from a worthy friend of mine, who had a principal ſhare in framing the plan for the relief of the widows and children of Preſbyterian miniſters; and who communicated to me not only ſeveral uſeful papers, but likewiſe whatever remarks he thought might enable us to improve our Plan, on the experience of any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties or deficiencies that had occurred in the execution of theirs.</note>, perhaps, there may be, long accuſtomed to view every Tranſaction of our Church on this Continent with a jealous eye, and who being loudly tenacious of every pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of their own, tho' ſparing in their allowance to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers—may therefore conceive more to be Intended by this undertaking than is Expreſſed.</p>
            <p>TO ſuch, however, if it may have any weight with them, I will declare, that altho' every thing relative to this deſign from the beginning has paſſed thro' my own hands, aſſiſted by a few others, appointed for that purpoſe, I have never known the leaſt hint or thought of any thing further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the execution of it, than what our charters expreſs.</p>
            <p>BUT ſhould it have all that happy Effect to us which ſome may apprehend from it, namely—that of producing a more intimate Connexion and UNION among our Clergy and Church-members; ſurely it is what we ought moſt ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſire and purſue, at this time eſpecially.</p>
            <p>WHEN we ſee our Church and Miniſtry unreaſonably oppoſed, and borne down in their common and eſſential rights; when we behold men ſeemingly Leaguing together to perpetuate this oppoſition from Father to Son; it can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be no Harm in us, but our bounden Duty, to look to our own Concerns alſo; and particularly to take ſome
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011469_0032_0F833030A9922E70"/>
Thought, that our Children be not left wholly Deſtitute in a world where We, and They on our account, are likely to meet with ſo little favour from many—</p>
            <p>BUT my ſubject is CHARITY—I would not violate that ſubject; and I bleſs God that it hath not been violated, on our part, on this trying occaſion; and that our general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct hath been ſuch, as not to diſcredit the long-approved Moderation of that Church to which we belong.</p>
            <p>IN the ſpirit of meekneſs and ſober argument, firm, but (we hope) decent, our endeavour hath been to ſhew—That the Fears and Jealouſies muſtered up concerning us, could have no poſſible Foundation, without a total Abolition of the whole ſyſtem of Law and Policy in theſe Colonies; that the Contingency which could render ſuch an Abolition poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, is as unlikely to happen as any thing that can well be imagined in this world; and that therefore, on the whole, it reſts with the Conſciences of our opponents themſelves, to reconcile their own conduct to any principles of BRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THERLY LOVE and CHARITY, or to any other principles whatever, not bordering on Intolerancy of Spirit, and an undue luſt of Dominion on their own part.</p>
            <p>SO far, we may felicitate ourſelves. And if to have act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus can be thought a breach of CHARITY, we muſt reply, that there is a CHARITY to Truth and Right, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to all others. We have now but one ſtep further, my brethren, to ſecure a Conqueſt, equally compleat and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious—Let us, in the continuance of every act of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Love and Well-doing, be a LIVING ANSWER to Gainſayers; and the time may yet come, when, every other Strife being ſuſpended, we ſhall all be ſo mollified one to another, ſo poſſeſſed of the Spirit of Goſpel-Love, that we ſhall think it our mutual Honor, as it is our mutual Duty, to mix our whole endeavours in the Propagation of our Common Chriſtianity, only ſtriving whoſe Zeal ſhall be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt—nay, and even to mix our Deeds of Charity to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011469_0033_0F83303179481000"/>
the diſtreſſed, they with us, and we with them, as God ſhall give us abilities, without regard to Sect or Party.</p>
            <p>HAPPY time, ſhould it ever take place! For then would Men indeed FEEL a Truth, now little attended to; and which I wiſh I could write in letters legible to the whole Univerſe—"That there is a greater Weight and Moment of CHRISTIANITY, in one Deed of Benevolence, where we have the Power to do Good, or in one Sigh for Diſtreſs, where we have not the power (proceeding from a heart that is right towards God, and towards man) than in all the doubtful Points of Controverſy, all the Oppoſition to Modes and Forms, that have buſied and enflamed the world ever ſince the REFORMATION—and which will never deſerve the true name of a REFORMATION, till this foul Reproach is wiped away from it alſo!"</p>
            <p>BUT till that happy time arrives, it is to thoſe of our own Communion we muſt chiefly look, for the ſucceſs of the pious Charity before us. Humane and benevolent as they are known to be in all caſes of Diſtreſs, the FATHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LESS and WIDOWS of their own Clergy will never be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Advocates and Benefactors among them.</p>
            <p>THE particular Rules by which this Charity is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted are open to all; and the main ſupport of the Fund is to be the annual Subſcriptions of the Clergy themſelves, with ſuch caſual Benefactions as, by the Providence of GOD, may be added to it.</p>
            <p>IF Succeſs ſhould, in any Degree, be anſwerable to our hopes and wiſhes, it will ſurely be a high Satisfaction to the members of our Churches, to behold their Miniſters ſo relieved from thoſe anxious cares, which every man muſt have on the proſpect of leaving a diſtreſſed Family behind him, as to proceed cheerfully in all Duty; knowing, that altho' they can acquire little, and leave leſs of their own in this world, there is ſome ſmall proviſion to place their
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:011469_0034_0F833032297192C8"/>
children above total want, and ſome Protectors and Friends to guard their Infant-years.</p>
            <p>BUT a ſtill higher Satisfaction will ariſe at the laſt Day, to all who have participated in ſuch LABOURS OF LOVE—to hear thoſe whom their Benevolence hath relieved, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them before their ALMIGHTY JUDGE—or rather to hear their ALMIGHTY JUDGE himſelf teſtifying in the name of thoſe relieved Deſtitutes, and embracing them with the following glorious ſentence—</p>
            <p>
               <q>COME, ye bleſſed of my Father! inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world—</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>FOR I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; thirſty, and ye gave me drink; a ſtranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; ſick, and ye viſited me; in priſon, and ye came unto me.</q>—</p>
            <p>THAT all of us may be ſo Habituated to acts of Mercy and Love in the preſent world, as to be found fit for this happy ſentence in the next, may GOD, of his infinite Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, grant thro' JESUS CHRIST! Amen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:011469_0035_0F833032EA9F3588"/>AFTER the concluſion of the foregoing SERMON, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry generous collection was made at the Church-doors for the benefit of the Charity, as will appear by the annexed liſt of donations. And the members of the corporation, having continued in church till the congregation was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, proceeded from thence to preſent an addreſs of thanks to the honourable Governor PENN, for his Grant of a Charter; requeſting that their thanks might, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, be tranſmitted, thro' him, to the honourable Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the province, THOMAS PENN, and RICHARD PENN, Eſquires, for the hearty approbation they had given of the deſign; to all which his Honour was pleaſed to return a very affectionate anſwer, expreſſive of his readineſs, at all times, to ſerve the intereſt of the Church of England in general, and this Charity in particular.</p>
            <p>AFTER dining together, the corporation applied themſelves to the buſineſs for which they were met; and the great attention paid to it by the lay members—the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy and care with which all the propoſed articles and fundamental rules were examined, digeſted and corrected, eſpecially by the gentlemen of the law, deſerve to be held continually in grateful remembrance by the Clergy. Some of the gentlemen who were preſent, had been kind enough to come from 30 to 60 miles diſtance, to make up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite majority. The ſame zeal would have been manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the reſpectable Lay-members reſiding at New-York, notwithſtanding their great diſtance, if their preſence had been abſolutely neceſſary. But it was reſolved to ſpare them as much as poſſible till the next year's meeting. The members preſent at this meeting of October 10th, 1769, were as follow.</p>

               <head>LAWS relative to ANNUITIES, &amp;c.</head>
               <p n="1">I. THE yearly contributions of the clergy, whoſe widows and children ſhall be hereby intitled to annuities, ſhall not be leſs than eight Spaniſh milled dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, of the preſent current weight, namely, ſeventeen pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-weight and ſix grains, nor more than twenty-four ſuch dollars, or the value thereof, in current money of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, where each contributor lives.</p>
               <p n="2">II. No annuities ſhall be paid but to the widows and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch clergymen as ſhall have been contributors to the fund; and the reſpective annuities to be paid to the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and children of ſuch clergymen, ſhall be five times the ſum of their annual contributions.</p>
               <p n="3">III. In order to have a certainty, both as to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, as well as the payment of the annual rates, each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributor ſhall abide by that rate or claſs which he firſt choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; unleſs he ſhall change into another claſs, on ſuch terms as to the corporation ſhall appear to be reaſonable: And each

contributor ſhall pay his annual contribution to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, on or before the firſt Wedneſday after the feaſt of St. Michael in every year, under the penalty of one penny in the pound for every day's default: And if the ſaid penalty of one penny in the pound, together with the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions due, ſhall not have been paid up during the life of the contributor, then his widow and children ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive only an annuity proportionable to the payments made by the huſband or father.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Every yearly contributor, who ſhall marry oftner than once, ſhall pay one year's contribution extraordinary on every ſuch marriage, as he makes the chance in general worſe againſt the fund.</p>
               <p n="5">V. If the huſband or father of any perſon or perſons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to an annuity on this plan, ſhall not have paid five an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual contributions into the fund; then the widow and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall only be intitled to ten per cent. per annum for thirteen years, on the amount of the contributions paid by the deceaſed.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. If any contributor ſhall have paid for five years, or any number of years under fifteen, and exceeding five, the annuitants ſhall receive only half the annuity which belongs to the rate or claſs ſubſcribed to by the deceaſed, until ſuch time as the yearly deduction of half the annuity, added to five or more payments, made by the deceaſed (without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting intereſt) ſhall together make a ſum in the fund, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the ſum of fifteen annual payments in the rate or claſs to which ſuch deceaſed contributor belonged; which partial annuities, payable agreeable to this article, ſhall be proportioned between the widow and children as hereafter fixed, in reſpect to full annuities, viz.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. If there be no children, the widow of every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributor, if fewer than fifteen payments ſhall have been made by the deceaſed, ſhall receive the whole annual ſum due by the laſt preceding article; and if fifteen ſuch pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011469_0039_0F833035D1539F88"/>
ſhall have been made complete by the deceaſed, then the widow ſhall receive the whole annuity due on the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's contribution during her widowhood; and if ſhe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry again, ſhe ſhall, from the time of ſuch ſecond marriage, receive only half ſuch annuity during her natural life.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. If there be a child, and no widow, ſuch child ſhall be intitled to the whole or partial annuity for thirteen years, agreeable to the foregoing articles; but if there be more than one child, and no widow, the annuity, whether whole or partial, ſhall be equally divided among them, to be laid out, in caſe they are minors, in their education or appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeſhip, with the advice and approbation of ſuch executors or guardians as the father may have nominated; and if none ſuch ſhall have been nominated by the father, then in ſuch manner for the benefit of the child or children, as the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration ſhall direct.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. If there be a widow, and one child, the annuity, whether whole or partial, ſhall be equally divided between them, under the limitations aforeſaid: And if there be a widow, and two or more children, ſhe ſhall have one third during her widowhood, or one ſixth during her natural life, if ſhe ſhould marry a ſecond time; and the remainder for thirteen years, ſhall be laid out for the uſe of the children as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="10">X. The corporation may, if they think proper, with the conſent of the annuitants, or of their guardians, if they be minors, pay the child or children of contributors ſuch a ſum in hand, as ſhall be equal to the annuity of ſuch child or children, according to the number of years for which ſuch annuity ſhould be paid, deducting legal intereſt, and taking into the account the chances againſt the life of ſuch child or children, for the term ſuch annuity is to be paid.</p>

The annual meetings of the corporation, appointed by the charter, ſhall be alternately held in the provinces of New-York, New-Jerſey and Pennſylvania; and ſix weeks previous notice of the time and places of all annual meetings, ſhall be given by the ſecretary, in one or more of the public News-papers, publiſhed in New-York, and in Philadelphia.

The foregoing Sermon was the firſt public notification of the deſign; and, excepting the collection at the Church-door, no application hath yet been made to benevolent perſons, it being judged beſt to delay every thing of this nature till the Plan ſhould be firſt laid before the world. The thanks of the Corporation are, however, to be ſincerely offered, for the following Benefactions already come in, viz.</p>
