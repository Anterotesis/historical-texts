            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>MR. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> had ſix children, three boys, and three girls; the eldeſt boy's name was <hi>George,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Charles,</hi> and the third <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the girls names were <hi>Maria, Charlotte,</hi> and <hi>Harriot.</hi> In this little book I intend to give you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of each of them; as, I dare ſay, you will like to read about ſo many little boys and girls, and know which of them were good, and which naughty.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> were both extremely fond of their children, and took great pains
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021148_0009_0FB2517EC82CCDD0"/>
to educate them properly, and make them behave as all little boys and girls ſhould do; but, notwithſtanding all their care, Maſter <hi>Charles</hi> would very frequently give them a great deal of uneaſineſs, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his bad behaviour, for he was not at all good-tempered, and uſed continually to be getting into miſchief, and quarrelling with his brothers and ſiſters. One day when his papa had given <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Tom</hi> an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as a reward for their having read, and written, and ſaid their taſks very well, he aſked for one likewiſe; but his papa ſaid, "No, <hi>Charles,</hi> I ſhall not give you an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I aſſure you, you have not at all minded your book, nor your writing, if you had, I would have given you one as well as your brothers; but I will not treat naughty boys the ſame as if they were good; and if you do not behave bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to-morrow than you have done to day, I ſhall look you up in my ſtudy, and not ſuffer you to go to play all day." <hi>Charles</hi> knew,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:021148_0010_0FB25180312757F0"/>
that if he ſaid any thing ſaucy, his papa would certainly puniſh him I ſo he hold his tongue, though he looked exceedingly croſs and out of humour; and when he went into the garden he began to quarrel with his brother. <hi>George,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>give</hi> me your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for I have as much right to it as you. Indeed <hi>Charles,</hi> you have not, replied <hi>George,</hi> for my papa gave it to me, becauſe I was good, and if you had been ſo, he would have given you one; but I will give you half, if you pleaſe—you are very welcome to half, though I cannot ſpare it all. You <hi>ſhall</hi> ſpare it though, ſaid he, for I will have it all. If you ſay ſo, <hi>Charles,</hi> ſaid <hi>George,</hi> you ſhall not have any: So will you have half, or go quite without? I will have <hi>all,</hi> replied he. Then you ſhall not have any, ſaid <hi>George,</hi> and ſo good-bye to you, and away he ran, whilſt <hi>Charles,</hi> who ran after him, but could not overtake him, kept throwing ſtones after him, one of which
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021148_0011_0FB25181EDDFC258"/>
                  <figure/>
hit his leg, and bruiſed it very much.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was running after <hi>George,</hi> his brother <hi>Tom</hi> paſſed by playing with his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, toſſing it up and catching <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t again, like a ball. <hi>Tom,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> give me that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! I will give you a bit of it, returned <hi>Tom,</hi> but I cannot ſpare it all. But you ſhall give it <hi>all,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> for I <hi>will</hi> have it; and then he ran to him, and tried to get it out of his hand. <hi>Tom</hi> for a good
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021148_0012_0FB251834B5C2C30"/>
while kept it, by turning it about, and ſtooping and putting it in his pocket. At laſt, <hi>Charles</hi> being ſtronger and older than his brother, threw him down upon the ground, and took it from him, tied his legs together, and then walked off eating the apple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tom</hi> was a good-natured little boy, and would not have minded parting with his apple, if his brother would have aſked pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for it; but he did not like to have it taken in ſuch a manner, and to have his legs tied; ſo he could not help crying, and called out, <hi>Charles!</hi> brother <hi>Charles!</hi> pray come, and untie my legs! But <hi>Charles,</hi> like a naughty boy, did not attend to him, but only laughed at what he had done, and ate up the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without returning poor little <hi>Tom</hi> one mouthful, though it was his own.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were in this ſituation, <hi>George</hi> came by, and aſked <hi>Tom</hi> what he was cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for? I cannot help crying, ſaid he, <hi>Charles</hi> has taken away my apple; but I
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021148_0013_0FB2518B2F6A2B18"/>
would not mind that if he had not tied my legs together, ſo that I cannot walk at all! O! don't cry, my dear, replied <hi>George,</hi> I will untie your legs; and here, you may have my apple, if you pleaſe. No, thank you, brother, ſaid <hi>Tom,</hi> indeed I will not take your's. I don't mind going without my apple, only I don't like to have it taken away as <hi>Charles</hi> took it. No body would like that indeed, ſaid <hi>George;</hi> but you ſhall have a bit of mine, ſo he took out his knife, and after paring it, and taking out the core, gave little <hi>Tom</hi> half.</p>

He therefore called him, and aſked how he came to be ſo naughty? But <hi>Charles,</hi> inſtead of acknowledging his fault, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſorry for it, only ſaid, he did it becauſe he <hi>wanted</hi> an apple, and ſhould do ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

time, unleſs he had one of his own. Why then, ſaid Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> I think it is very neceſſary you ſhould be prevented from doing ſo again: I ſhall therefore tie your hands behind you, and your legs together, as you did <hi>Tom'</hi>s. <hi>Charles</hi> then began to cry, and beg his papa not to puniſh him; but Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> told him, that as he thought he deſerved puniſhment, he certainly ſhould inflict
<figure/>
it, though he was very ſorry to be obliged to do it. Accordingly he tied his hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

him, and his legs together, ſo that he could not walk, and made him continue in that uncomfortable way all day, while <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Tom</hi> were enjoying their liberty, and running about.</p>

               <p>They had not gone far before they met a little girl, not quite three years old, crying and ſobbing moſt ſadly.

Pray, ſaid <hi>George,</hi> very civilly, is either of your names <hi>Will?</hi> Mine is, replied a boy of about fourteen years old! what do you want? And pray, ſaid <hi>George,</hi> have you a little ſiſter? Yes, half a dozen, anſwered the boy, do you want any of them? And where, ſaid <hi>George,</hi> is one about three years old? I left her in the road, ſaid <hi>Will!</hi> Did you ſo? ſaid <hi>George,</hi> and who is to take care of her whilſt you are at play? are you not aſhamed to leave ſuch a poor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle creature by herſelf? ſhe is crying enough to make her, ſick: Pray go to her, and either take her home, or elſe let her be with you, and don't leave her in the road, perhaps ſhe may be run over.

Maſter <hi>George</hi> for his concern for his ſiſter, went to play again with the other boys.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Tom</hi> were very ſorry to find he would not be prevailed with to help his ſiſter; and when they returned, they found her ſcreaming ſtill more than when they left her; for a great dog was come to her, and was licking her face and hands, not with a deſign to hurt her, but the poor little girl thought he was going to bite her, and was terribly frightened indeed.</p>

                  <hi>George,</hi> who was an exceedingly good-natured boy, could not bear to ſee her in ſuch diſtreſs, and he could not tell how to help her; for, to carry her home would take up a long time, and his papa, you know, told him to return directly, ſo he did not know what to do about it. At laſt, after thinking a little while, he determined to take her back with him, and and deſire his mamma to ſend her home to her mammy. Come, little girl, ſaid he, I will take care of you, don't cry, I will take care of you; give me your hand, and I will lead you, I am ſo tired, ſaid ſhe, I cannot walk any further. Then I will carry you, ſaid <hi>George,</hi> and very good-naturedly took her up in his arms, and walked home as faſt as he could; for he had been out longer than he ought to have been, and knew that his papa would be wondering he did not return.</p>

               <p>BEFORE Maſter <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Tom</hi> had got home they met Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> coming to ſeek for them. <hi>George,</hi> ſaid he, where have you been all this time? Did not you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe me you would return directly? Sir, ſaid <hi>George,</hi> I aſk your pardon for ſtaying ſo long; but, I am ſure, when you hear what has kept me, you will not be diſpleaſed. This lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle girl we found alone in the road, and I have been trying to comfort her, and ſend her home. He then told his papa all that had paſſed between him and her brother; which, when Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> heard, he was not at all angry that <hi>George</hi> had not returned ſooner. Well, ſaid he, I am very glad to hear you have been ſo well employed. I was afraid you had met with ſome accident, or had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that you ſaid you would return ſoon;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021148_0023_0FB251CA75526BD0"/>
and that made me uneaſy, for I ſhould have been extremely ſorry, either to have had you hurt, or that you ſhould not have kept your word; for that would have been ſtill worſe, in my opinion, than being hurt: but you are a good boy, and it gives me great pleaſure to ſee you ſo. Come, bring your little child home, and we will give her ſome victuals and drink, and then you ſhall conduct her to her mother, who, I am ſure, will be much obliged you for the care of her daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George</hi> was much pleaſed to find his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approved of what he had done, and with great good-humour, carried the little girl all the way in his arms. See, how kind he looks, wiping her eyes, whilſt his

               <p>MRS. <hi>Jennet</hi> and her three daughters were in the parlour when Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> and the two young gentlemen returned.</p>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> was ſtanding at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, folding up a ſhirt of her papa's, which ſhe was making, and had juſt finiſhed ſtitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſhoulder ſtraps, and had left off work. Look, mamma, ſaid ſhe, there is my papa, and my brothers; and <hi>George</hi> has got a child in his arms. Whom can he have found? I don't know, indeed, my dear, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> looking up as ſhe ſpoke. I will go and ſee, ſaid <hi>Charlotte,</hi> and away ſhe ran, and in her hurry the lock of the door caught hold of her pocket hole, and tore her frock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charlotte</hi> was a very good-humoured girl, but was rather too great a romp, and often would get herſelf into diſgrace by means of her careleſſneſs; for though her papa and mamma liked to ſee their children cheerful
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:021148_0026_0FB251F002101380"/>
and merry, yet they did not like to ſee their little girls quite like little boys, and clamber over gates, and chairs, and tear their clothes off their backs. It certainly is not pretty for little girls to be ſo rude; but <hi>Charlotte</hi> was rather apt to forget herſelf, and not always behave quite ſo well as her mamma wiſhed her.</p>
               <p>I was beginning to tell you of her going to ſee whom <hi>George</hi> had in his arms when ſhe tore her frock, which ſhe never ſtopt to look at, when ſhe was firſt entangled, but ran heedleſsly away, by which means the frock was torn quite to the bottom. However ſhe did not mind that, but called out to <hi>George,</hi> Who is that, <hi>George?</hi> What little girl is that? O! 'tis a nice little girl! ſaid <hi>George,</hi> and carried her into the parlour. When he put her down, the poor little thing ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no body but ſtrangers, burſt out a crying, and ſaid, I want my mammy! I want my mammy! And who is your mammy? my dear, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Jennet.</hi> She is my own dear
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021148_0027_0FB251F236E71590"/>
mammy! replied the little girl. But what is your name? ſaid Mrs. <hi>Jennet.</hi> Little <hi>Nance,</hi> ſaid ſhe. Little <hi>Nance,</hi> is it? ſaid Miſs <hi>Maria:</hi> Then come to me little <hi>Nance,</hi> and don't cry, and I will give you an orange. Thank you, Ma'am, ſaid the child, and made a pretty curteſy. There's a good girl, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Jennet.</hi> See, my dear, how good ſhe is; ſhe does not forget to ſay thank you, Ma'am, for all ſhe is ſuch a poor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle girl, and ſo very young. You, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> though ſo much older, forget to ſay ſo: Are you not aſhamed that this little child ſhould behave ſo much better than you do? and, ſee too how nicely ſhe holds up her head; I am ſure ſhe is a nice little girl.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> then went out of the room, and returned with a large piece of bread, and ſome plumbs, which ſhe gave to little <hi>Nance,</hi> who again remembered to ſay thank you, Ma'am, and made another curteſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Harriot,</hi> who was an exceedingly good girl, and took great pleaſure in ſeeing children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021148_0028_0FB251F54E955660"/>
have well, was much pleaſed with her civility, and aſked her, whether ſhe had any play-things? Yes, Ma'am, ſaid ſhe, mammy makes me a doll of her handkerchief. And have you no other doll? aſked <hi>Harriot.</hi> No, Ma'am. Then I will give you mine. Shall I, Madam? ſaid ſhe, turning to her mamma as ſhe ſpoke. Yes, my dear, if you pleaſe, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Jennet.</hi>
                  <figure/>
I like to ſee you good-natured, and willing to part with your play-things, to pleaſe poor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle girls who have none of their own. So <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> ran up ſtaris and fetched her own down:
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021148_0029_0FB24E87621D4E90"/>
it was dreſſed in a blue jacket, and black cap, and red ſhoes; it was a very nice doll, and <hi>Harriot</hi> was very kind to give it to little <hi>Nance,</hi> and ſo all children ſhould be, if they wiſh to have any body love them.</p>
               <p>After the little girl had eaten up her bread and plumbs, ſhe began again to cry for her mammy. Don't cry, my dear, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Jennet;</hi> you ſhall go to her, if you will be good. So ſhe rang her bell, and deſired the maid to carry her home to her mother. But Maſter <hi>George</hi> begged he might go with her, and ſo did all the young ladies. Mrs. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> who never denied them any thing proper to be granted, gave them leave to go; but Miſs <hi>Charlotte,</hi> whoſe frock was in ſo ſhabby a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, could not poſſibly attend them. At firſt ſhe began to cry, when her mamma told her ſhe might not go; but ſhe ſoon wiped up her tears, as ſhe well knew, if ſhe was ſeen to cry upon ſuch a trifling affair, it would much diſpleaſe her mamma, and ſhe would certainly be puniſhed. Now, ſaid her mamma, you
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021148_0030_0FB24E888DCEE1B0"/>
ſee the conſequence of not taking more care of your clothes. You cannot go out with your ſiſters. You know, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> you often ſuffer for it: I wonder you don't take more care. You ſhould have ſtopt when you found the lock had caught hold of your frock; but you are very careleſs indeed; ſo now you muſt take off your frock and mend it. I want to go to play now, ſaid <hi>Charlotte.</hi> You ſaid I ſhould leave off work when I had done the ſhoulder-ſtraps. Well, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> replied her mamma, I did let you leave off then, and did not intend you ſhould do any more; but you have ſo torn your frock, that it muſt be mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I cannot let you go ſo in rags. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inſiſt upon it, that you go and change it immediately, and come and mend it. <hi>Charlotte</hi> knew that her mamma muſt me minded, and therefore thought it was beſt to do as ſhe was bid at once, without ſaying any more about it: So ſhe went up ſtairs, put on another frock, and then brought the torn one to mend, which ſhe did before ſhe went to play. Whilſt <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte</hi>

was thus employed at home, <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Maria, Tom, Harriot,</hi> and the maid, went to carry little <hi>Nance</hi> to her mother, who lived at <hi>Daiſy-Down,</hi> a ſmall village about two miles from Mr. <hi>Jennet'</hi>s houſe. When they came near the place where <hi>Nancy'</hi>s mother lived, they met the poor woman (whoſe name was <hi>Brown)</hi> in great diſtreſs, looking for her little girl; for her ſon <hi>Will</hi> had returned home, and told her he had loſt little <hi>Nance:</hi> nor could he tell what was become of her. He ſet her down only while he went to play, he ſaid, and when he came to look for her ſhe was gone. When poor Mrs. <hi>Brown</hi> heard this account, ſhe was in ſuch diſtreſs ſhe did not know what to do with herſelf. <hi>Will</hi> too began to be very ſorry he had not taken more care of his ſiſter, and the whole family were in great affliction; for ſhe was a very good little girl. When Mrs. <hi>Brown</hi> ſaw her child coming with the Maſter <hi>Jennets,</hi> ſhe ran to them, and begged to know how they got her? Maſter <hi>George</hi> then told all about his finding
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:021148_0032_0FB24E8D88A7F140"/>
her, and his wanting to perſuade her brother <hi>Will</hi> to take care of her; but that he could not, and, added he, I would have brought her home at firſt, but I was afraid my papa would be uneaſy at my ſtaying ſo long, for I knew he expected me very ſoon.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Brown</hi> thanked him a thouſand times for his care of her little girl, and ſaid, ſhe did not doubt but that he would be a good man, as he was ſo good and kind a boy. She likewiſe thanked the young ladies for their kindneſs, and particularly Miſs <hi>Harriot</hi> for the doll ſhe had given her <hi>Nance.</hi> They then wiſhed her a good night, and returned home; and <hi>George</hi> bought himſelf a ball as he went back. For though that was his buſineſs, when he firſt ſet out in the morning, yet he had been ſo buſy, taking care of the little girl, that he had not had an opportunity of doing it.</p>
               <p>When he was in the ſhop buying his ball, he ſaw a very good kite, which he aſked the price of, and finding he had money enough, he
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021148_0033_0FB24E8E78C44D88"/>
purchaſed it for his brother <hi>Charles. Tom</hi> begged he might carry it home, which <hi>George</hi> gave him leave to do, as he always tried to pleaſe every body.</p>
               <p>The kite was almoſt as big as <hi>Tom,</hi> ſo that when he put it upon his back it quite hid him, and the kite looked as if it was walking alone. Look, here is the picture of <hi>Tom</hi> going home with the kite upon his back.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as they got home, <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Tom</hi> went directly to carry their purchaſe to <hi>Charles.</hi> Here, ſaid <hi>George,</hi> I have bought you a kite, brother <hi>Charles;</hi> will you be pleaſed to accept of it? I bought it on purpoſe for you. Yes, I <hi>will</hi> have it! ſaid <hi>Charles.</hi> I think I never heard ſuch an ugly manner of receiving a preſent in my life. Inſtead of ſaying, thank you, brother, I am much obliged to you, but am ſorry you have given yourſelf ſo much trouble, and put yourſelf to any expence on my account, to ſay, <hi>Yes, I will have it.</hi> Could any thing ſound more unmannerly, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to what he ought to have ſaid, in return for his brother's kindneſs? <hi>Charles</hi> then began to cry again, for you know his papa had tied his hands and feet together: And now, when he ſaw ſuch a nice kite, he wanted ſadly to be at liberty, and go to play with it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:021148_0035_0FB24E9DDD193418"/>
                  <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Tom</hi> were very ſorry to ſee him in ſuch a ſtate, and went to their papa to beg him to releaſe him. But Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> ſaid, No, my dear boys, I cannot conſent to that: I am very ſorry to confine him; I don't like to puniſh any of you; but if children will be naughty, they muſt ſuffer for it; it makes me very uneaſy to think that he ſhould deſerve it; but I ſhould be as much to blame as he is, if I did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prevent his being ſo naughty again. If he will behave as he ſhould do, I will untie him when he goes to bed.</p>
               <p>As Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> never broke his word, <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Tom</hi> knew it would be uſeleſs to urge it any farther. They therefore went back to ſit with <hi>Charles,</hi> who, I am ſure, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their kindneſs in keeping him company, inſtead of playing out of doors, and diverting themſelves; as he only pouted, looked croſs, and ſaid, it was owing to them that he was puniſhed, becauſe they would not give him their apples.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:021148_0036_0FB24E9F02635FB8"/>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George</hi> ſaid all he could to perſuade him to be good, and aſk his papa's pardon; but he would not mind, and only continued croſs to every body all day, and very uncomfortable to himſelf: For people who are out of humour, are always uncomfortable and unhappy.</p>
               <p>When night came, and it was time for the young gentlemen and ladies to go to bed, Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> was in hopes that <hi>Charles</hi> would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his fault, and aſk to be forgiven; but
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021148_0037_0FB24EA0879F7638"/>
                  <hi>Charles,</hi> although he had been in a ſtate of puniſhment all day, was ſtill not good enough to do that: So Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Charles,</hi> I ſee you are determined to be a naughty boy, and as that is the caſe, I aſſure you, <hi>I</hi> am <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> to make you good; and if you will not be ſo without, you muſt be puniſhed 'till you are; and unleſs you will aſk my pardon this moment for being ſo naughty, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me ſo much trouble and uneaſineſs, you ſhall go to bed with your legs tied together, and your hands tied behind you; and ſo you ſhall continue all night.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> cried ſadly when he heard his papa threaten him ſo much, but ſtill continued naughty, and would not aſk forgiveneſs; ſo his papa had him put to bed, and then went up and tied his legs and arms again, and ſo he lay all night, and very uneaſy he found it. By the time morning came, he was quite tired of his confinement, and began to be ſorry he had been ſo naughty, and wiſhed moſt heartily he had been good ſooner. He could not get up
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021148_0038_0FB24EA1F4F86CC0"/>
becauſe his legs and arms were tied, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired one of his brothers to go and tell his papa that he was ſorry he had behaved ſo.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> very kindly, went up ſtairs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly (which was more than he deſerved, as he had been obſtinate ſo long, and therefore had no <hi>right</hi> to expect to be heard the moment he choſe to aſk forgiveneſs) to hear what he had to ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles,</hi> when he ſaw his papa, burſt out a crying, and ſaid, he would be a good boy, if he would be ſo kind as to untie him. If you will, ſaid Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> I will releaſe you; for it is no pleaſure to me to give you any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I wiſh to ſee you happy, but you never can be ſo, unleſs you are good.</p>
               <p>He then untied his hands and feet, and ſat by him all the time he was getting up, talking to him, trying to perſuade him to be good, and always kind and obliging to every body; at the ſame time aſſuring him, if he was naughty, he ſhould certainly puniſh him the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021148_0039_0FB24EA8EB79CE78"/>
next time, with much greater ſeverity than he had now done.</p>
               <p>When he was dreſſed he let him go down to breakfaſt, bidding him wipe his eyes, leave off crying, and be a good boy. And indeed his papa was much pleaſed to find <hi>Charles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be good; for nothing gave Mr. Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> ſo much joy, as to ſee their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren all good and happy together.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as breakfaſt was over, Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> and his three ſons went into the ſtudy, as they conſtantly did for four or five hours, to read, write, and repeat their taſks; whilſt Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> with the young ladies, ſpent the ſame time in the parlour in reading, writing, needle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and all their various occupations.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Miſs <hi>Maria</hi> was working a muſlin apron for her mamma, which ſhe did very neatly, and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:021148_0041_0FB24EABE56FD8D8"/>
took great pains to keep it clean, as it looks very ugly to have work dirty. Miſs <hi>Charlotte,</hi> as was ſaid before, was making a ſhirt; and Miſs <hi>Harriot</hi> was ſtitching a pocket for her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Charlotte;</hi> and when that was finiſhed, ſhe was to begin one for herſelf. She was a very neat little work woman, indeed every thing ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook ſhe did extremely well, for ſhe took uncommon pains with herſelf, and always tried to mind all the inſtructions which either her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or any good friends were ſo kind as to give her. She never, like ſome ſilly children, did thoſe things out of their ſight, which ſhe knew they would not approve of if they had ſeen her; but ſhe very wiſely conſidered, that it was only for <hi>her</hi> benefit they troubled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to tell her what was proper, or what not ſo, and therefore at all times endeavoured to follow their advice; and this made her improve faſter than either of her ſiſters, and conſequently be much more admired and beloved than they were: For though they were far from being ſuch naughty girls as many are, yet they were
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:021148_0042_0FB24EB3CFE37970"/>
not ſo good as Miſs <hi>Harriot,</hi> particularly Miſs <hi>Charlotte,</hi> who, in this reſpect I am now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, uſed frequently to be very ſilly. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member once I was ſtanding in the hall, whilſt Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> and <hi>Harriot</hi> were in the parlour. They did not know any body was near them, and I overheard the following dialogue.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>CHARLOTTE. Pray, <hi>Harriot,</hi> while your mamma is out of the room, why do you keep your feet in the ſtocks? Do you like to keep them ſo cloſe confined?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="unknown:021148_0043_0FB24EB9E812E940"/>
HARRIOT. No, I do not much <hi>like</hi> it; but my mamma, you know, <hi>bid</hi> me put them in when I firſt went to work.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE. Yes, I know ſhe bid you put them in; but now ſhe is gone out of the room ſhe won't ſee you. I always take mine out when ſhe goes away.</p>
               <p>HARRIOT. I know you do, but I think that is very naughty. Don't you conſider that mamma loves us dearly, and only tells us what is right for the ſake of making us good and happy: It can be of no advantage to her I am ſure, whether we turn out our toes or not. If we behave ever ſo ungenteelly, people will not accuſe mamma on that account; but they will diſlike us very much indeed: As well they may. Beſides, I think it is quite wicked not to do what my mamma chooſes I ſhould. She is very kind to us, and, I am ſure, we ought to mind her, and be good always.</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE. Yes, we <hi>ought</hi> to be good, to be ſure; but if we are good when ſhe ſees us, I think that is quite enough.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:021148_0044_0FB24EBD022F6708"/>
HARRIOT. O! fie, fie, <hi>Charlotte!</hi> I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you are not aſhamed of ſaying ſo! I would not do what my mamma don't like, upon any account: That I would not. Beſides, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways get into ſome trouble or other when you behave ſo. You know, the other day, when ſhe bid you not touch her knife, that you cut your fingers moſt ſadly, playing with it when ſhe went out of the room; and when you clamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over the rail into the orchard, after ſhe told you not, you know, how you tore your ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and your leg too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Don't you remember it?</p>
               <p>CHARLOTTE. Yes, that I do, for my leg is not well yet; nor more is my hand that I cut, for it is very ſore.</p>
               <p>HARRIOT. I am ſorry you ſhould be hurt; but indeed, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> you deſerve to meet with ſuch accidents, when you will not mind, and do what mamma likes, becauſe ſhe don't <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> you.</p>
               <p>Juſt as Miſs <hi>Harriot</hi> ſaid this, Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> returned into the room; and Miſs <hi>Charlotte,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:021148_0045_0FB24EBE82C57CE8"/>
upon hearing her mamma coming, tried to put her feet into the ſtocks; but, in her hurry ſhe ſtaggered againſt Miſs <hi>Harriot,</hi> threw her off her ſtool, and finding herſelf likewiſe in danger of falling, caught hold of a little table which ſtood by her; but inſtead of being able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the accident by ſo doing, ſhe pulled it down upon herſelf and ſiſter, and very much hurt and bruiſed them both; nor were thoſe all the bad conſequences which enſued, for Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> had juſt been filling her little ink bottle from a larger one, which ſhe had ſet upon the table, and that falling down, had broke and emptied itſelf over the young ladies; though, as Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> had ſaved her ſiſter's clothes, by falling over them, moſt of the ink was poured upon herſelf, and a terrible figure ſhe made when ſhe got up. The ink bottle fell upon her head, ſo that it ran all down her hair, face and neck, and upon her frock, and then upon her work (her papa's ſhirt) which ſhe had in her hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:021148_0046_0FB24EC174DA1EF0"/>
As ſoon as <hi>Harriot</hi> could get up ſhe ran out of the room to call ſomebody to wipe her ſiſter. The maid ſoon came in, and wiped her as dry as ſhe well could, and mopped up the ink from the carpet; but it left a ſad black mark upon the floor, which ſhe could not get off. She then took <hi>Charlotte</hi> up ſtairs to waſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs her: But, with all her waſhing, ſhe could not poſſibly make her face and neck clean; the ink would not come off, and ſhe looked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like a tawny Moor for a great many days;
<figure/>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:021148_0047_0FB24EC621E8B5B8"/>
ſo that (before their papa and mamma told them it was not <hi>good natured</hi>) her brothers called her, Siſter <hi>Tawny,</hi> and <hi>Charlotte Blacky.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When ſhe was clean dreſſed, her mamma called her to her, and very gravely ſaid to her, I hope, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> you now ſee the bad effects of not minding what I ſay to you. All this miſchief which you have done, is owing to your not keeping your feet in the ſtocks when I went out of the room. Had you minded my words, and done your duty by obeying my orders, you would not have been in ſuch a hurry at my return, to put your feet in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place: You would neither have thrown down and hurt, either your ſiſter or yourſelf: You would not have broke the bottle, and waſted all the ink: Nor would you have ſpoiled your papa's ſhirt, or your own clothes: But ſome bad conſequence always follows when lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle children will not mind what is ſaid to them.</p>
               <p>I will tell you a hiſtory of a little girl I once knew, who uſed to be guilty of the ſame fault,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:021148_0048_0FB24EC783D59910"/>
and whoſe ſufferings, I hope, will teach you to be more obedient for the future.</p>
               <div type="history">
                  <head>The Hiſtory of Miſs POLLY INGRATE.</head>
                  <p>MISS <hi>Polly Ingrate</hi> was a little girl, whoſe papa and mamma were very fond of her, and uſed to take great pains to inſtruct her in every thing which was proper.</p>
                  <p>She was but ſeven years old, therefore it was impoſſible ſhe ſhould know what was right or wrong ſo well as her parents; but though ſhe was ſo young, ſtill ſhe was fooliſh enough to think ſhe knew as well as her friends; and whenever they told her not to do any thing, ſhe always ſtood and argued, and ſaid, But why may not I? What is the reaſon? Becauſe it is not proper, they would tell her. And then ſhe would argue again, But <hi>why</hi> is it not proper?</p>
                  <p>To hear a child argue ſo, is certainly diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, as it appears as if they wiſhed not to do as they are adviſed.</p>
                  <p>At the upper end of Mr. <hi>Ingrate's</hi> garden
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:021148_0049_0FB24EC8FA7F3070"/>
there was a fiſh pond: And as children, when at play are apt to run too near the edge of the water, <hi>Polly</hi> was deſired never to go beyond a row of trees, which grew in the middle of the garden. But <hi>why</hi> may not I? ſaid ſhe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I don't chuſe you ſhould, ſaid her mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. But why not? ſhe aſked again. Becauſe, replied her mamma, I am afraid you ſhould go too near the water. No, I ſhall not! ſaid ſhe. I know I ſhall not! I will take great care! I am ſure I will not go too cloſe! Say no more about it, ſaid her mamma, for I do inſiſt upon it that you never go beyond the trees. Now a good child would have minded at once, without arguing about it; but after Mrs. <hi>Ingrate</hi> had ſo repeatedly told her not to go beyond the trees, it certainly was <hi>extremely</hi> naughty to think of it: However, <hi>Polly</hi> was wicked enough to do it; and one day, when her mamma was out of the way of ſeeing her, ſhe went beyond the trees to play at ball. She could play very well, and ſometimes caught above an hundred without once letting it fall;
<figure>
                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:021148_0050_0FB24ECD78F3F0D8"/>
                     </figure>
and the day ſhe ſo naughtily went to play, where ſhe ſhould not, ſhe happened to play remarkably well, and had caught it an hundred and thirty ſix times, without once letting it tumble, ſo that ſhe had been looking up a great while without ſeeing where ſhe went: And running to catch it, the hundred and thirty ſeventh time, her foot ſlipt upon the edge of the pond, and in ſhe fell.</p>
                  <p>When ſhe found herſelf falling into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe recollected all which her mamma had ſaid to her, and wiſhed moſt heartily that ſhe
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021148_0051_0FB24ECF10DC5860"/>
had minded, and not been ſo naughty, and ſcreamed out, I will be good! pray pull me out! ſo loud, that a gardner, who was digging at ſome little diſtance heard her, and ran to help her. He juſt got time enough to ſave her, for had he been one minute later, ſhe would have been ſo low under the water he could not have ſeen where ſhe was, nor been able to have taken her out. She was ſo frightened and hurt by the fall, that he ſcarcely knew whether ſhe was alive or dead when he firſt took her in his arms: However he carried her in doors, and ſhe was put to bed, where ſhe was obliged to lay four days before ſhe could get up, having caught a moſt violent cold by being in the water.</p>
                  <p>Her papa and mamma were extremely ſorry for the accident, and ſtill more ſorry to think that ſhe ſhould have been ſo very naughty as not to mind what they had ſaid to her. They both talked to her a great deal, and tried to <hi>convince</hi> her of the folly and ſin of not taking good advice; and ſhe appeared ſo conſcious of her fault, that they were in great hopes ſhe
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:021148_0052_0FB24ED07B871708"/>
would never be guilty of the ſame again. But it was not a great while afterwards before ſhe forgot how much ſhe had ſuffered through the want of obedience, and went into a little dirty yard, where ſhe had been bid not to go, as the hogs were kept there, and it was not at all a proper place for a young lady to play in. There was one of the ſows had a litter of twelve pigs. <hi>Polly</hi> ſtooped down to ſtroke them; but the ſow, fearing ſhe was going to hurt them, bit her fingers ſo bad, that one of
<figure/>
                     <pb n="58" facs="unknown:021148_0053_0FB24EDBE8CDFFC8"/>
them was obliged very ſoon to be taken off. She ran crying and ſcreaming in doors, but was afraid of ſeeing her papa or mamma, as ſhe knew ſhe deſerved puniſhment for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the hog yard after ſhe had been po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively forbid.</p>
                  <p>Her papa and mamma again endeavoured to convince her of her fault, and told her, that had ſhe minded them, the ſow could not have bit her fingers, as ſhe never went out of her ſty and little yard. I did not intend to hurt the pigs, ſaid <hi>Polly.</hi> Very likely not, replied her mamma; your fault was not in <hi>ſtroking</hi> the pigs, but in going where you had been bid <hi>not</hi> to go. That is what I am angry with you for? but I hope the puniſhment you have met with, from the ſow's biting you, will teach you not to do ſo, or <hi>any thing</hi> you are told not, any more.</p>
                  <p>After having ſuffered twice ſo very ſeverely from her diſobedience, any body would have thought that ſhe would have grown good, and for the future minded every thing that was ſaid to her. But ſtill that was not the caſe: And
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021148_0054_0FB24EDD2F772368"/>
ſhe continually kept doing thoſe things out of her parents ſight, which ſhe would not dared to have done had they been preſent. Amongſt the reſt, one which ſhe was guilty of was eating fruit whenever ſhe went into the garden to play. Her mamma had many times charged her not to pick any, promiſing her, ſhe ſhould have given to her as much as was proper and good for her health. But notwithſtanding all her mamma could ſay to her, ſhe uſed, when in the garden alone (and when every body was in the front part of the houſe, ſo that ſhe was not ſeen) to pick and eat it: The conſequence of which was, that ſhe grew extremely ſick, and had a terrible pain in her ſtomach, ſo that ſhe was obliged to take great quantities of very naſty phyſick to give her eaſe; but ſtill ſhe was not broke of her naughty tricks; and one day when ſhe was at play in her mamma's chamber (though ſhe had been told over and over again never to go to an open window) ſhe was look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it, and ſliping a little farther than ſhe intended, fell out, and broke her back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:021148_0055_0FB24EDEDDF75B30"/>
At firſt, when they took her up they thought ſhe was dead; but ſhe ſoon came to her ſenſes again, and after laying a great many months in bed, and ſuffering a prodig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious deal of pain, was able to get up; and after ſome months were paſt, could walk about: But ſhe never grew any taller, but continued moſt ſhockingly crooked indeed.</p>
                  <p>She is now a woman, and you cannot think how ſadly ſhe looks. She is never well: Her back ſticks out worſe than any thing you can imagine, and her ſhoulders are as high as her ears; and all this was the conſequence of not minding what had been ſaid to her when her friends were out of ſight. And had you, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> continued Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> juſt now been more hurt by the table's falling upon you, it would have been your own fault for taking your feet out of the ſtocks, after I had deſired they might be kept in. Indeed, my dear, it is not right to behave ſo. All good children who love their papas and mammas, will always do as they wiſh them, and ſtrive to deſerve
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021148_0056_0FB24EE0447841B0"/>
their ſavour and kindneſs by a proper behaviour and how happy ſhould I be, if mine would do ſo. I will! I <hi>will,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charlotte,</hi> crying at the thought of her former folly. I <hi>will</hi> be good, my dear mamma, and always do as you deſire me. Then, ſaid Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> I ſhall love you better than I can expreſs; and every body will be as fond of <hi>you,</hi> as they are of your ſiſter <hi>Harriot.</hi> For my part, I ſhall love all my children alike, if they will be all equally good, and ſo will your papa too, I am ſure, for we have no reaſon to love one better than another, unleſs they behave better.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Charlotte</hi> liſtened to all her mamma ſaid with great attention, and promiſing to behave well, and always do as ſhe was bid, made a curteſy and walked away.</p>

               <p>AFTER Maſters <hi>Jennet</hi> had finiſhed their ſtudies above ſtairs, and their three ſiſters below, they all went to play together in the garden; and <hi>Charles,</hi> who was then in good humour, took his kite, and, with the aſſiſtance of his brothers, flew it very well.
<figure/>
They were all much delighted to ſee it mount ſo high in the air; and there is no ſaying how long they might have purſued the amuſement,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:021148_0058_0FB24EE7EB8B6A48"/>
had not a trifling accident happened, which put a ſtop to their ſport.</p>
               <p>Little <hi>Tom,</hi> who was running as faſt as he could, with his head toſſed back, looking at the kite, and not ſeeing where he went, ran with ſuch force againſt a large tree as knocked him down backwards, and not only ſtunned him with the fall, but happened to hit his head a violent blow upon a ſharp ſtone, cut ſo large a gaſh upon the back of his head, as made it bleed very much indeed. All his brothers and ſiſters ran to him, and tried to lift him up; but finding he could not ſtand, they began to think he was dead; and when they ſaw the blood run, they were all <hi>ſure</hi> that was the caſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> took him up between them, whilſt Miſs <hi>Maria</hi> walked beſide them, holding her handkerchief to the wound in his head to ſtop the blood, and <hi>Charlotte</hi> and <hi>Harriot</hi> made all the haſte they could in doors, calling out, <hi>Tom</hi> is killed! <hi>Tom</hi> is
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021148_0059_0FB24EE955306870"/>
killed! Upon hearing this, Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> and two or three of the ſervants, all came out together to ſee what was the matter, and met poor little <hi>Thomas</hi> carried in the manner related, and his brothers and ſiſters crying as they brought him in. As ſoon as ever they ſaw him they perceived he was only ſtunned, and not dead.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> took him in his arms, and ſaid, do not cry, my dears, your brother will be better preſently, I hope; and having put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

You cannot imagine how greatly rejoiced his brothers and ſiſters were to ſee him ſo much recovered, for they had all concluded he was dead. When, therefore, they found him well enough to ſit and eat a little dinner, they were ſo delighted they ſcarcely knew how to expreſs their joy.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>AS ſoon as dinner was over, <hi>Charles</hi> was in a hurry to go and look after his kite, as he had left it without regarding what became of it to help his brother <hi>Tom,</hi> when firſt he fell down; and was ſo taken up with the thoughts of him afterwards, that he never looked for it until after dinner, when he ſaw <hi>Tom</hi> ſo much better. He went into the garden in hopes of finding it there; but no kite was to be found, nor could he tell where to go and ſeek for it, as it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly might fly a great way after he left it before it fell to the ground. However, he reſolved to go the way the wind blew when he flew it, and enquire of all the neighbours, whether it had fallen into any of their gardens? So having aſked his papa's leave, he ſet off in the ſearch of it. He ſtopt at ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the neighbours gates, and aſked very
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:021148_0061_0FB24EF249B949D0"/>
civilly to go into the garden and look for his kite, and they all very kindly permitted him to go; but no kite could he find. At laſt as he was walking on, intending to aſk one more lady to let him go into her garden, he ſaw a great many boys ſtanding together, and as he paſſed by, turned his head towards them, and perceived they were juſt beginning to raiſe a fine large kite; which, upon looking more earneſtly at, he found
<figure/>
was his own. He directly ran up to them
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021148_0062_0FB24EF3F4D4D378"/>
and called out, That is <hi>my</hi> kite! ſo pray give it me directly! for I have been look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it! <hi>Your</hi> kite? ſaid the boy, who was running with the ſtring in his hand, in order to make it fly, I wonder what made it <hi>your's!</hi> I am ſure it is my own, and I wonder what made it <hi>your's!</hi> replied <hi>Charles;</hi> for, I am ſure, it <hi>is</hi> mine! That it is not, ſaid the boy. That it is, anſwered <hi>Charles!</hi> and I <hi>will</hi> have it! That you ſhall not ſaid the boy, for I found it, and will keep it, and not give it to you, I aſſure you. You will not? ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> then I will give you <hi>that,</hi> ſtriking him a blow in the face. O! you chuſe to fight, do you, maſter? replied the boy; if that's the caſe, I will fight with you with all my heart, and immediately he ſtript and began.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> (who, as has been ſaid before, was not of a good temper) in a moſt violent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion attacked the boy, who being rather ſtronger than himſelf, preſently conquered, and beat him moſt terribly indeed; whilſt
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:021148_0063_0FB24EFAD44BC918"/>
the blood ran as plentifully from his noſe and face, as before it had done from his brother <hi>Tom's</hi> head. At laſt, with his eyes almomſt beat out, and extremely hurt, he begged the boy to leave off, ſaying, he did not chuſe to fight any more; upon which the boy left him; and <hi>Charles</hi> ſeeing the kite in a little boy's hand, who had been holding it during the battle, ran to it, and in a violent rage drove his hand through it, and tore it all to pieces. <hi>There!</hi> ſaid he, if you will not let <hi>me</hi> have it, <hi>you</hi> ſhall never have it again. Upon <hi>Charles'</hi>s offering this violence to the kite, all the boys who had only ſtood and looked on before, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately began to reſent it, and kicked, and cuffed, and beat him about until he could ſcarcely crawl home: Where he was glad to return, as faſt as in his miſerable condition he could; and had he ſtayed much longer, it is very probable he might have been killed, for they not only thraſhed him, but
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:021148_0064_0FB24EFBFA61FBE0"/>

               <p>WHEN <hi>Charles</hi> came into the parlour, his papa and mamma, and all his brothers and ſiſters, were quite amazed to ſee him; both his eyes were ſwelled as big as eggs, and the blood from his noſe had run into his mouth, and all down his chin and throat, and over his waiſtcoat; and his coat and hair were all covered with mud; ſo that he made a moſt ſhocking appearance indeed. What have you been about, <hi>Charles?</hi> ſaid Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet;</hi> where have you been to? and what is the matter with you? <hi>Charles</hi> anſwered, I have been fighting with a boy for my kite! I am ſo provoked I don't know what to do with myſelf! I found my kite: ſome boys had it, and they would not give it me. I wiſh I could kill them! O fie, for ſhame! ſaid Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> is that a proper manner of talking; becauſe a boy has offended you? I am aſhamed of you indeed, <hi>Charles:</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:021148_0066_0FB24F02126A2C20"/>
but pray tell me all about it. How did the boy get the kite? I don't know how he got it, ſaid <hi>Charles:</hi> but I am quite poſitive it was mine, and I told him ſo, and aſked him to give it me directly, but he would not. I am afraid, replied Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> you did not behave right, and aſk for it in a civil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per manner: If you had, I think he would have returned it. Did you tell him how you loſt it? No, not I (ſaid <hi>Charles</hi>) I told him it was mine, and I would have it; and when he would not give it me I ſtruck him; that was all; and then he thraſhed me ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully; but he never will have the kite again however! I am glad of that! I took care he ſhould not have the pleaſure of fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it any more, for I tore it all to pieces, and broke the ſticks, and then, like a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of cowards, half a dozen boys fell upon me all at once, and threw ſtones and mud at me. I ſhall not, ſaid Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> pretend to juſtify the behaviour of the boys for throwing
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:021148_0067_0FB24F0942EE07D0"/>
ſtones at you: but indeed, <hi>Charles,</hi> it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely your own fault, that you are now in this ſad, bruiſed, ſhabby condition; and had it not been for your own haſty diſpoſition, you might, in all probability have reigained your kite, and ſaved yourſelf thoſe blows you have received. How often have I told you never to put yourſelf in a paſſion; but to enquire calmly and good humouredly into things, before you allow yourſelf to be angry. Had you followed my advice, and done ſo now, how much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſhame might you have ſaved yourſelf: The boy, no doubt found the kite where it had fallen, therefore until he met the true owner of it, was at liberty to keep it. When you ſaw him with it, you ſhould civilly have enquired whether he did not find that kite, as you had lately loſt it, and ſhould be greatly obliged to him if he would return it. Had you, <hi>Charles,</hi> made uſe of ſuch kind of expreſſions, I doubt not but the boy would have returned it: Or, had he refuſed to do ſo, you might have ſaid, If you think that I am miſtaken, and that it is not
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:021148_0068_0FB24F0AE8FFB658"/>
mine, pray let my papa and brother ſee it, and they will be able to tell you; for they know my kite. Had you, I ſay, <hi>Charles,</hi> behaved in this manner, you might have been certain that I would have taken care you ſhould have had your
<figure/>
kite again: But to put yourſelf in a paſſion, and begin to <hi>fight!</hi> what could you expect but to be beaten, and diſgraced as you are? And then to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the kite, was ſurely the height of folly and indiſcretion; as it is now <hi>impoſſible</hi> for you
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:021148_0069_0FB24F0D2A2E6A88"/>
to have it reſtored, even though the boy ſhould be convinced it really was your's. But people who will be ſilly, and wicked enough to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch paſſions, will always ſuffer for it; and it is very proper they ſhould; but I cannot help being very ſorry, that any of my children ſhould be ſo naughty; however, you muſt go and be waſhed, and cleaned, though you really do not deſerve to have any care taken of your bruiſes. Had you been hurt like <hi>Tom,</hi> without being guilty of a fault, I ſhould have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſorry for the pain you ſuffered; but now, I think, you well deſerve it all: And, I hope, the miſerable condition you are now in, will keep you from putting yourſelf in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and fighting again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> liſtened to all his papa ſaid, but it did not ſeem to have any very good effect; for when Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> ceaſed ſpeaking, he muttered out, I am glad I have ſpoiled the kite however!</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> again endeavoured to convince him of the folly of ſuch behaviour. How can you, <hi>Charles,</hi> ſaid he, chuſe to act ſo much like
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:021148_0070_0FB24F0EE030EFB0"/>
the dog in the manger? and becauſe you could not enjoy the pleaſure of playing with the kite yourſelf, rejoice that nobody elſe can? I don't wonder, that you ſhould be ſorry to loſe ſo nice a plaything, after your brother had been ſo very kind as to give it to you; but when once it is gone and you have it not, why ſhould you be glad that it cannot be of ſervice to another boy? Indeed, <hi>Charles</hi> I am much concerned to find you have ſo bad a diſpoſition; and, I aſſure you, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you take pains with yourſelf, to grow more good tempered, you will always be an unhappy, miſerable man; as it is impoſſible for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are croſs, ſelfiſh, and paſſionate, ever to be happy, or make any body love them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> made no reply to what his father ſaid, but went out of the room to be waſhed and cleaned.</p>

               <p>IN the evening, after the two wounded young gentlemen were gone to bed, Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> Miſs <hi>Maria,</hi> and Maſter <hi>George,</hi> went to take a walk, and ſeeing a great many boys to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> inquired whether either of them had found a kite that day? Yes, Sir, ſaid one of them very civilly, I found one this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And pray, replied Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> what did
<figure/>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:021148_0072_0FB24F17AFB8DBA0"/>
you do with it? Why, Sir, anſwered the boy, I will tell you. I and my playfellows were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fly it, when a boy came, and ſqualled out, that it was <hi>his,</hi> and he <hi>would</hi> have it; now as I did not know by what right it was his, I ſaid, he ſhould <hi>not</hi> have it; but, ſaid he, I will! ſo I told him he ſhould not! and upon my refuſing to give it him, without telling me that he had loſt one, or giving me any reaſon to think that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to him more than to myſelf, he gave me a knock in the face, ſo then I gave him another, and we went to fighting, and I beat him; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I left off, like a ſimpleton as he was, he tore and broke the kite all to pieces; ſo that if it really was his own, he can never have it again. It was a thouſand pities to ſpoil it, for it was a charming good one. But, ſaid Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> how came you not to return it when he told you it was his? I would, Sir, anſwered the boy, if he had aſked me civilly, or told me he had loſt it; but he demanded it in ſo inſolent a manner, that I aſſure you, I thought he deſerved to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:021148_0073_0FB24F192B211B70"/>
out it; and indeed I did not believe it was his; for I thought if it had been, he would have given an account in what manner he loſt it, and not only have ſaid, I <hi>will</hi> have it: Indeed ſaid Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> I cannot wonder at you, for when people will put themſelves in a paſſion, inſtead of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſonably upon any ſubject, there is no poſſibility of underſtanding what they mean. I do not therefore blame you for refuſing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the kite 'till you was aſked civilly for it; but I think you did wrong by fighting about it. I did not want to fight, Sir, ſaid the boy; but I aſſure you, he began firſt, and was in ſuch a rage, that I was obliged to beat him as I would a wild beaſt, to keep him from doing me ſome miſchief. I am ſure I don't like fighting; I would rather by half live peaceably with every body, for I hate quarrelling, and my father and mother ſay it is very wicked. I think ſo too, ſaid Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> and then, after wiſhing him a good night, returned home.</p>
               <p>After they were ſeated, Mr. <hi>Jennet,</hi> took one of the hands of Maſter <hi>George,</hi> and Miſs <hi>Maria,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:021148_0074_0FB24F1AACDCD918"/>
in his own, and ſaid, I hope, my dears, what you
<figure/>
have this afternoon ſeen and heard, will warn you from ever ſuffering yourſelves to be in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. You ſee how terribly your brother <hi>Charles</hi> is beat and hurt, owing to his own violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and becauſe he would not give himſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e to talk coolly and reaſonably with the boy, who you find would willingly have given him the kite, had <hi>Charles</hi> aſked properly for it. Not only with regard to your playthings, whilſt you are children, would you be able to manage
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:021148_0075_0FB24F1DD31C4DB0"/>
much better, if you would be aways calm and good humoured, and patiently wait to hear what each had to ſay; but likewiſe when you are men and women, you will find that nothing will ſucceed as you wiſh, if you ſuffer your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be agitated and diſcompoſed when any circumſtance happens different to what you like: And once more I will repeat, for you cannot too well remember, that <hi>no one,</hi> whether children, men or women, can ever be happy who are not good humoured. Here Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> ſtopped; and after <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Maria</hi> had kiſſed and wiſhed their papa and mamma a good night, made a bow and curteſy, and went to bed.</p>

               <p>THE next morning Maſter <hi>Tom'</hi>s head was pretty well, but Maſter <hi>Charles'</hi>s face and eyes were very bad indeed, and frightfully ugly he did look; his eyes black, his noſe and mouth extremely ſwelled, and a great cut on one ſide of his chin, which the point of a nail had torn in one of his falls, while he was fighting; ſo that had any little boys ſeen him, I think they would have taken care never to fight any more, had they ever been ſo ſilly before.</p>
               <p>Whilſt they were at break faſt, a man came to the door with a box upon his head, directed for Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet.</hi> They ordered it to be brought in, and then told the children to try and untie the cord that was round it, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a good deal of difficulty, they did, but then it was locked, and having no key, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> looked ſadly diſappointed, as they were in hopes to have found it open. What ſhall we do now? ſaid they. How ſhall we get it open? for it is
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:021148_0077_0FB24F21F2197C38"/>
locked, and we have no key? O! ſaid Mr. <hi>Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi> here is a key, and your mamma has another, ſo I hope we ſhall ſoon open it, and ſee its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents. <hi>Charles</hi> took the key and opened the box,
<figure/>
while they all ſtood round to ſee what was in it; but how were they ſurpriſed to find three rods, a fool's cap, and four ſilver medals, each tied through <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ole with a yellow ribband. On one of them was the following words, Whoever wears this, is a croſs child: Upon another, Whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wears this, cannot be depended upon when
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:021148_0078_0FB24F22EBD42B48"/>
out of ſight: Upon a third, The wearer of this has told a lie: And on the fourth, This medal is a badge of ſloth and idleneſs. All the Miſs and Maſter <hi>Jennets</hi> were much diſappointed to find the box contain ſuch diſagreeable objects, and all of them looked very grave, turned away, and walked to their ſeats. I find, my dears, ſaid their papa, the ſight of what the box contains is very diſagreeable to you; and no doubt, rods and ſuch kind of things, muſt be far from agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any body: For my part, I diſlike the ſight of them as much as any of you can, and ſhall be very glad never to be obliged to open the box any more; but it is the duty of all parents to make their children good; and if they will not be perſuaded to mind without, they muſt be puniſhed. You may depend upon it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that theſe rods, this ridiculous fool's cap, and theſe medals will be taken out, and uſed, if any of you render it neceſſary, otherwiſe, the box ſhall never again be unlocked. He then locked it up, and carried it out of the room; but ſoon returned with another box of the ſame ſort,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:021148_0079_0FB24F246B021220"/>
though much larger than the firſt. Now, ſaid he, try my dears, and open that. They were all ſo diſappointed at the contents of the other, that they had no great inclination to open it; but upon their papa's giving them the key, and telling them to do it, they unlocked it, and lifting up the lid, diſcovered it to be filled with books, bats, balls, kites, nine pins, marbles, work-bags, houſe wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, dolls, boxes, and a great variety of pretty things, which I do not now recollect. They ſoon changed their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and each one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſmiled at ſo pleaſing a proſpect. Well, how do you like the contents of this box, ſaid Mr. <hi>Jennet?</hi> They all replied, they liked it very well. And which, ſaid he, ſhould you chuſe to receive ſome of; what is now before you, or what you ſaw in the other box? They all again replied, that they ſhould much prefer what they now ſaw, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to have another ſight of the other as long as they lived. Neither do I, replied their papa; and I aſſure you, it entirely depends upon yourſelves, whether it is ever opened
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:021148_0080_0FB24F278C9A6CD8"/>
again or not. If you are good, and behave as you ought, as you all very well know how to do, <hi>this</hi> box (touching the one before them) is the only one that ſhall ever be unlocked, and, from <hi>this</hi> I will reward you according to your merits; but if you are naughty, and will not mind what is ſaid to you, I again repeat, that the other <hi>muſt</hi> be opened, and what is in it, uſed upon you, with great ſeverity.</p>

               <p>FOR the whole week following the arrival of the two boxes, all the Miſs and Maſter <hi>Jennets</hi> behaved extremely well indeed; ſo that their papa and mamma thought proper to reward them out of the <hi>good child's box,</hi> as it was called, the other being named the <hi>naughty child's box:</hi> and as they thought books would not only amuſe, but at the ſame time inſtruct them, they gave each of them a book. To Maſter

                  <hi>George</hi> they gave one intitled the <hi>Father's Gift;</hi> to Miſs <hi>Maria,</hi> the <hi>Mother's Gift;</hi> to <hi>Charles,</hi> the <hi>Hiſtory of the Holy Bible;</hi> to <hi>Charlotte, Virtue and Vice;</hi> to <hi>Harriot,</hi> the <hi>Lilliputian Maſquerade:</hi> and to <hi>Thomas,</hi> the <hi>Juvenile Biographer:</hi> all of them very pretty, entertaining, inſtructive books, very well worth your reading, and ſold by Mr. <hi>Thomas,</hi> at his Book-ſtore, near the Court-Houſe, in <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and by all the bookſellers in town and country. This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction is given, in caſe any good little children ſhould wiſh to read them, and not know where to buy them; and, no doubt, their papas and mammas will will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly aſſiſt them in the purchaſe, if they will take pains with their reading, and mind the good advice which is given in thoſe pretty books.</p>
               <p>All the Miſs and Maſter <hi>Jennets</hi> were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly well pleaſed with their different books, and after thanking their parents in an handſome manner, went to read them. As ſoon as they
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:021148_0083_0FB24F2BED4E57C8"/>
had read through, and looked at all the pretty pictures in their own, they lent them to each other, and, by that means, had the pleaſure of ſeeing <hi>ſix</hi> entertaining books apiece; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it employed them ſeveral days, before they could read them through. After they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed this amuſement for four days, and all had very good humoredly lent them to one another, whenever deſired to do ſo, <hi>Charles,</hi> who ſeldom continued good long together, began to grow naughty again; and when his ſiſter <hi>Harriot</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to lend her his book, he very rudely, and croſsly refuſed, and ſaid, <hi>No, indeed I won't<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Are you going to read it, brother <hi>Charles?</hi> ſaid <hi>Harriot.</hi> If you are, I do not deſire it: but if you are not making any uſe of it, I ſhould be much obliged to you for it, for a little while, and you ſhall have it the moment you want it. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Harriot</hi> ſpoke ſo very prettily, he only anſwered, "That ſhe ſhould <hi>not</hi> have it! and though he was not reading it now, he could not tell how ſoon he ſhould! beſides, whether he read it or not, he liked to keep it in his own
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:021148_0084_0FB24F2E5ECE6DC8"/>
pocket, and ſhe ſhould not have it at all!" Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> did not interrupt him, till he had done ſpeaking, and then he ſaid, <hi>Charles,</hi> you know I always keep my word, and never promiſe what I do not perform. I told you if you were good you ſhould be rewarded with ſomething out of the <hi>good child's box,</hi> and accordingly I gave you a pretty book, becauſe you had been good for ſome days. I likewiſe told you if you were naughty, you ſhould be puniſhed, and I now muſt keep my word. I am ſorry to be obliged to unlock the <hi>naughty child's box;</hi> but your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour makes me do it: he then took the key out of his pocket, and fetched in the medal which had the words upon it, <hi>Whoever wears this is a croſs child!</hi> and tied it with the yellow ribbon round his neck. He cried ſadly at having it put on; and to be ſure that is not to be wondered at, as it looked extremely ridiculous to ſee a yellow ribbon round a boy's neck: and a bow, and long ends hanging upon his coat down his back, and a medal bobbing about under his chin with ſuch
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021148_0085_0FB24F319817F800"/>
diſgraceful words upon it: but, as he had been ſo croſs to his ſiſter, it was proper he ſhould be puniſhed. All his brothers and ſiſters looked very grave when they ſaw it put on: indeed, ſome of them could not help ſhedding tears upon the occaſion, as they were all very fond of each other, and did not like to ſee one another in affliction: they aſked their papa to take it off, but, after again telling them how neceſſary it is to puniſh children when they are naughty, and convincing them that he muſt not break his word, and praiſing them for their affection to their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he inſiſted upon its being worn all day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> was quite aſhamed of walking about, for every body who ſaw him took hold of the medal, and read the inſcription upon it. Some people ſaid, there's a <hi>croſs boy!</hi> Do not go near him! Others ſaid, that boy deſerves to be whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped! So that he found he was laughed at, and deſpiſed by every one who ſaw him, and moſt heartily ſorry he was that he had behaved ſo.</p>
               <p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>In the afternoon, ſome gentlemen and ladies drank tea with Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> felt ſo exceedingly aſhamed when he came into the room, he did not know which way to look. As ſoon as he made his appearance, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at firſt what it was, they all enquired, why he choſe to wear ſo much frightful yellow rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon round his neck? But when they were cloſe enough to read the words upon the medal, they begged he would not come near any of them, as they all greatly diſliked <hi>croſs</hi> people. <hi>Charles</hi> was
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:021148_0087_0FB24F344FC1FB38"/>
ſo mortified at the diſgrace, that he could not help crying all the time he was in the room; and very early deſired leave to go to bed; and upon his promiſing not to behave ſo any more, and acknowledging he was ſorry for his fault, his papa took off the medal, and permitted him to retire.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Saturday</hi> came, and they all had been very good, excepting <hi>Charles</hi> one day, that he was naughty about lending his ſiſter his book, Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> again opened the <hi>good child's box,</hi> and took out of it a bat and cricket-ball for <hi>George;</hi> a very pretty flowered work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bag for <hi>Maria;</hi> a doll for <hi>Charlotte;</hi> a battledoor and ſhuttlecock for <hi>Harriot;</hi> a kite for <hi>Thomas;</hi> and as <hi>Charles</hi> had been much better than uſual, excepting that one day when he was puniſhed, they were ſo kind as to give him an orange; telling him at the ſame time, that they were very ſorry that he had by his behaviour forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a more valualuable reward; but as he had been good ſome days, he ſhould not go quite unrewarded from out of the <hi>good child's box;</hi>

and they hoped by the next week he would gain ſomething better. After having ſeen the ſad conſequences of being naughty, not only as it produced puniſhment, but likewiſe as it was the cauſe of going without ſome pretty play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at the end of the week, it never could have been thought that any of the Miſs or Maſter <hi>Jennets</hi> would again be ſilly, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the diſpleaſure of their parents; but, I am ſorry to ſay, ſome of them ſtood in need of repeated chaſtiſements. Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> was apt to be very ſilly, and one day, ſhe, <hi>Harriot,</hi> and little <hi>Tom,</hi> had been to take a walk in the field behind the houſe with the maid; and Miſs <hi>Charlotte,</hi> inſtead of walking in the path, ran all over the field in the very dirtieſt parts ſhe could find out. The maid deſired her not to do ſo; but inſtead of minding, ſhe only tried to perſuade her brother and ſiſter to do ſo too; but they, like very good children, ſtopt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were deſired. Upon which <hi>Charlotte</hi> laughed at them, and called them <hi>tender chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi> and <hi>fooliſh goſtins,</hi> to mind what the maid
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021148_0089_0FB24F37EAB1D710"/>
ſaid, and not only ridiculed their proper beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but likewiſe made faces at Mrs. <hi>Deborah</hi> (the maid) and flung dirt at her. When they
<figure/>
got home, Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> aſked <hi>Deborah</hi> how ſhe happened to go out in ſo very dirty a gown and cloak, as in general ſhe looked very tidy, and clean? I did not <hi>go out</hi> ſo dirty indeed, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, ſaid <hi>Deborah;</hi> but Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> did it. How did <hi>Charlotte</hi> do it? enquired Mrs. <hi>Jennet.</hi> She then told the whole affair, and how ſadly Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> had behaved, and wanted to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:021148_0090_0FB24F3D4C4FB3F0"/>
make her brother and ſiſter as bad as herſelf; but they were very good, and did not mind her. If that is the caſe, replied Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> I think ſhe behaves as if ſhe had not common ſenſe: the <hi>fool's cap</hi> will therefore be the propereſt head dreſs ſhe can wear. <hi>Charlotte</hi> began to cry, and beg it might not be put on; but her mamma ſaid, you know, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> if you will be naughty, you muſt be puniſhed, and if you did not chuſe puniſhment, you would not be guilty of ſuch things as deſerve it. Indeed, mamma, I do not chuſe it, ſaid <hi>Charlotte,</hi> pray do not put it on! You cannot expect, replied Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> that I ſhould break my promiſe, if I did, I ſhould be ſtill naughtier than you; and you know very well that I have told you, if you <hi>will</hi> be naughty, you ſhall be puniſhed. She then unlocked the <hi>naughty child's box,</hi> and took the fool's cap, and placed it upon <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte'</hi>s head. The cap was made ſomething in the ſhape of a ſugar loaf, and had two long ears, like aſſes, hanging from the ſides, and was painted red, blue, green, yellow, ſcarlet,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:021148_0091_0FB24F3F74FCCDD8"/>
and black; with bits of all coloured ribbons ſtreaming from it, and in the middle of the front was the picture of a naughty child cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that, you may think, it looked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ugly and ridiculous. Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> ſcreamed ſo loud when it was put on, that her mamma threatened to tie up her mouth, and took out her handkerchief for that purpoſe; but <hi>Charlotte</hi> left off, ſo ſhe put it in her pocket again. When dinner was ready, Mr. <hi>Jennet</hi> was quite ſhocked to ſee his daughter with ſo frightful a cap on her head; nor could her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<figure/>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:021148_0092_0FB24F4116F32EE0"/>
and ſiſters, or the ſervants, keep from looking at it, to ſee how ſtrange and ridiculous it looked. After dinner ſhe again begged it might be taken off. Her mamma told her it ſhould, when ſhe had been to <hi>Deborah,</hi> and aſked her pardon, and told her, ſhe was ſorry ſhe had behaved ſo badly, and promiſed not to do ſo any more. <hi>Charlotte</hi> did not like the thoughts of aſking pardon; but when ſhe found her mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma would not take it off, unleſs ſhe did, ſhe went out of the room, ſaying ſhe would go and aſk <hi>Deborah's</hi> pardon. Inſtead of which, ſhe only went up ſtairs into her own room for a few minutes, and then returned, and aſked her mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma to take the cap off. Have you, then, aſked <hi>Deborah's</hi> pardon? ſaid Mrs. <hi>Jennet.</hi> Yes, Madam, I have, ſaid ſhe! Only think how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely wicked it was to ſay ſo, when ſhe knew ſhe had <hi>not.</hi> Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> likewiſe knew ſhe was telling a fib, for ſhe had heard her go up ſtairs, and the maid was all the time below. Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> then ſaid, <hi>Charlotte,</hi> how dare you be ſo
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:021148_0093_0FB24F4357A8F9F0"/>
very wicked, and naughty, as to tell ſuch a fib. I thought you ſaid you did not like puniſhment; but you muſt now be puniſhed with very great ſeverity indeed. I am quite aſhamed of you, and do not know when I ſhall ever depend upon you again; but though <hi>you</hi> tell lies, <hi>I</hi> ſhall not, I aſſure you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhall puniſh you as I always ſaid I ſhould, if you ſpoke any thing which was not true. She then again opened the <hi>naughty child's box,</hi> and took out one of the three rods which was in it, and the medal that had the words, <hi>The wearer of this has told a lie.</hi> Then taking hold of <hi>Charlotte,</hi> tied the medal round her neck, and led her into another room by herſelf where ſhe whipped her as much as ſhe deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for being ſo wicked a girl; and that, you know, was a great deal, ſo that ſhe was moſt terribly puniſhed indeed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> then returned into the parlour, and found all the children crying for their ſiſter. I do not at all wonder, my dears, ſaid ſhe, to ſee you cry; I can ſcarcely keep from it myſelf. I love all my children, and am extremely ſorry
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:021148_0094_0FB24F44AA5670A0"/>
that any of them ſhould ſuffer pain and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; you may, therefore, well be concerned now, that ſhe has undergone ſo great a degree; and another cauſe ſufficient to cry for, is, the thought of her having been guilty of ſo wicked a thing as deceit, and lying; but I hope ſhe will never be ſo naughty again. Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> then fetched <hi>Charlotte</hi> into the room (for ſhe had left her by herſelf for a few minutes after ſhe had corrected her) and ſhe remained in the parlour all the reſt of the day, with the fool's cap upon her head, and the medal round her neck; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would her mamma ſuffer her to ſpeak a word to any of her brothers, or ſiſters, for fear ſhe ſhould teach them to be as naughty as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying, if ſhe did not make the proper uſe of her tongue, which was ſpeaking the truth, ſhe ſhould not uſe it at all; ſo, you may be ſure, ſhe ſpent a moſt miſerable, unhappy afternoon. At laſt bed time came, and her mamma was then ſo kind as to let her go to bed, though, indeed, children who tell lies do not deſerve a bed to
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:021148_0095_0FB24F495504B108"/>
ſleep upon, or blankets to keep them warm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> was in hopes, as ſhe appeared very ſorry for her faults, that ſhe would never be guilty of the ſame again, and therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted her to go to bed. But the thoughts of her crime was ſo much in her head, that ſhe could ſleep but very little all night; and the diſgrace ſhe was under, made her mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly uneaſy indeed, ſo that ſhe only laid and cried, and ſincerely repented that ſhe had been ſo very naughty.</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as ever ſhe was up in the morning, ſhe went to <hi>Deborah,</hi> and aſked her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give her, for the rudeneſs ſhe had been guilty of to her whilſt ſhe was walking in the field. She then went into her mamma's room, and moſt earneſtly begged, that ſhe and her papa would
<figure/>
pardon her, promiſing never to commit the ſame fault for the future. Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe was ſenſible of the wickedneſs and folly
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:021148_0097_0FB24F54472DAD50"/>
of the crime ſhe had committed, after talking a great while to her, and convincing her of the bad conſequences of deceit and falſehood, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her that nobody would ever depend upon her, or believe what ſhe ſaid, and alſo that it was extremely wicked, and would certainly make her very miſerable; they at laſt kiſſed her, and let her go down to breakfaſt; but ſtill they behaved very gravely to her, for it was impoſſible to have as good an opinion of her, as if ſhe had not been ſo naughty. She was, herſelf, very uneaſy at the thoughts of her folly; and endeavoured, all in her power, to make amends by being very good, and doing every thing ſhe was bid, which, to be ſure, was the only way to regain the love of her friends. But, ſtill it was impoſſible to <hi>untell</hi> the falſity ſhe had ſpoken; nor could ſhe be ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon afterwards, as if ſhe had not told it. When <hi>Saturday</hi> arrived, all the young folks waited with great patience, though they thought the time rather long, until the <hi>good child's box</hi> ſhould be opened, and when it was unlocked,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:021148_0098_0FB24F57F4FCAE98"/>
Maſter <hi>George</hi> had another book, a <hi>Hiſtory of Birds and Beaſts</hi> given him: Miſs <hi>Maria</hi> a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome fan: Maſter <hi>Charles</hi> a ſet of nine-pins: Miſs <hi>Harriot</hi> a ſet of doll's tea things; and Maſter <hi>Thomas</hi> a bag of marbles; but Miſs <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte,</hi> who had, during the week, been ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely naughty, had not any one thing given her, not even ſo much as an orange or an apple. She was, you may be ſure, ſadly mortified, to be obliged to go without, though ſhe could not but acknowledge ſhe did not deſerve any, and all the others were much delighted with their preſents.</p>
               <p>The example of <hi>Charlotte'</hi>s puniſhment, had ſo good an effect upon them, that all except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Charles,</hi> took care never to deſerve the ſame: neither was Miſs <hi>Charlotte</hi> ever guilty of telling another lie. Little <hi>Thomas,</hi> at one time, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his book for a few days; ſo that he was obliged to wear the medal which was the <hi>badge of idleneſs and ſloth,</hi> and, excepting that, Mr. and Mrs. <hi>Jennet</hi> never had occaſion to unlock the <hi>naughty child's box</hi> for any of their children
<figure>

but <hi>Charles;</hi> who, notwithſtanding all the pains that were taken with him, and all the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he met with when good, would frequently be very naughty, and was ſo bad as to oblige his papa to uſe, not only all the diſgraceful medals and fools cap, but alſo the rods upon him. All his brothers and ſiſters, when they grew up, were very worthy men and women, comfortable to themſelves, and beloved and admired by every body who knew them. Whereas, <hi>Charles,</hi> from the badneſs of his diſpoſition, and croſs diſoblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:021148_0100_0FB24F5A78D214E0"/>
temper, was deſpiſed, and ſhunned by all mankind; nobody liked to be in company with him, and even his brothers and ſiſters went but ſeldom to ſee him; though they would have gone with all their hearts, if he would but have been kind and civil to them; but, inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, he was ſo quarrel ſome, that they never knew how to pleaſe him, or not give offence. In ſhort, he was a moſt miſerable, unhappy man, and paſt all his time extremely uncomfortable, without being beloved by any one perſon in the world. He lived by himſelf, for no one choſe to live with him; nor could he ever get ſervants to ſtay with him above a month at a time; neither did any of his neighbours viſit him, becauſe they did not chuſe to keep company with ſo bad tempered a perſon. His ſad behaviour gave the greateſt uneaſineſs to his parents, and they would certainly have died of grief, had they not been comforted by the very different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his brothers and ſiſters, who, by their kind and dutiful behaviour, gave them great ſatiſfaction and joy; and, by their conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:021148_0101_0FB24F5CC9557338"/>
to every thing their father and mother liked, repayed that pains and care they had taken of their education. It is much to be wiſhed that all children, who read this hiſtory, will learn to imitate the good Miſs and Maſter <hi>Jennets,</hi> and, if ever they have been naughty before, it is to be hoped, that like Miſs <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte,</hi> they will repent, and be ſorry for their crimes, and take care never to be guilty of the ſame again, for fear leſt they ſhould at laſt come to be as unhappy and miſerable as Maſter <hi>Charles;</hi> which, they may depend upon it, they will be, if, like him, they neglect to mind what is ſaid to them.</p>
               <p>I hope therefore, the child who is now reading this pretty book, will remember and always take pains to be good.</p>
