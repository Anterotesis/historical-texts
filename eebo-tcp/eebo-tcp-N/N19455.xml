            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Hiſtory of South America, like all other hiſtories of newly diſcovered countries, has been ſo interwoven with fable, as in ſome meaſure to deter the youthful ſtudent from employing his time in the purſuit of <hi>Trifles;</hi> for in that light fabulous hiſtories muſt generally be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>
            <p>The Spaniſh Adventurers to the New World were moſtly illiterate men, whoſe principal purſuits were gold and ſilver. On their return to their native ſtate, their repreſentations were guided by intereſt and vanity; and, aſhamed of having made no obſervations on the rude arts, manufactures, and genius, of the people they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, they fabricated ſtories the moſt wild, romantic and ridiculous, to which the Spaniſh writers of thoſe days gave a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand.</p>
            <p>The literary world is undoubtedly much obliged to the labor, genius, and attention, of Dr. Robertſon, whoſe extenſive and polite connections enabled him to procure
<pb facs="unknown:025348_0004_0FCCDBA488F01218"/>information for his Hiſtory of America, which few other individuals could perhaps have obtained. We have therefore carefully conſulted and followed that work, by the aſſiſtance of which we may venture to ſay, that we have now the pleaſure of laying before our youthful Readers ſuch an epit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome of <hi>The Hiſtory of South America</hi> as may by no means be conſidered as fabulous, but as founded on the moſt authentic mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials and authorities.</p>

               <p>So nice and complicated are the arts of navigation and ſhip-building, that they require the ingenuity and experience of many ſucceeding ages, to bring them to any tolerable degree of perfection.

               <p>In proportion as the art of navigation encreaſed, men became more acquainted
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:025348_0014_0FCD004157CF8CF0"/>with each other, and a commercial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe commenced between remote nations. Men muſt have made ſome conſiderable advancements towards civilization, before they acquired the idea of property, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained it ſo perfectly, as to be acquainted with the moſt ſimple of all contracts, that of exchanging by barter one rude commod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity for another. However, as ſoon as this important right was eſtabliſhed, and every individual felt, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e had an excluſive ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to poſſeſs or alienate whatever he had acquired by his own labour or dexterity, the wants and ingenuity of his nature ſuggeſted to him, a new method of encrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing his acquiſitions and enjoyments, by diſpoſing of what appeared to him ſuperfluous, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to procure what was neceſſary or deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the poſſeſſion of others.</p>
               <p>As navigation and commerce extended, ſo in courſe did the intercourſe of remote nations. The ambition of conqueſt or the neceſſity of procuring new ſettlements, were no longer the ſole motives of viſiting diſtant lands. The deſire of gain became a new ſpur to activity, rouſed adventurers, and ſent them out on long voyages, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of countries, whoſe produce or want might encreaſe that circulation, which nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes and gives vigour to commerce. Trade proved a great ſource of diſcovery, it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unknown ſeas, it penetrated into new
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:025348_0015_0FCD0042C77443A0"/>regions, and contributed more than any other cauſe, to bring men acquainted with the ſituation, the nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of the different regions of the earth.</p>
               <p>The ſtructure of the veſſels uſed by the ancients was very rude and imperfect, and their method of working them on the ocean was very defective. Though the property of the magnet, by which it attracts iron, was well known to the ancients, its more important and amazing virtue of pointing to the poles had entirely eſcaped their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Deſtitute of this faithful guide, which now conducts the pilot with ſo much certainty in the unbounded ocean, during the darkneſs of night, or when the heavens are covered with clouds, the ancients had no other method of regulating their courſe than by obſerving the ſun and ſtars. Their navigation was conſequently uncertain and timid. They dared not even to quit ſight of land, but crept along the coaſt, expoſed to all the dangers, and retarded by all the obſtructions anavoidable in holding ſuch an aukward courſe. An incredible length of time was requiſite for performing voyages, which are now finiſhed in a ſhort ſpace. Even in the mildeſt climates, and in the ſeas the leaſt tempeſtuous, it was only during the ſummer months that the ancients ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured

The trade, therefore, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by the Phenicians of Sidon and Tyte was mote excenſive and enterpriſing than that of any ſtate in the ancient world. In many of the places to which they reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025348_0017_0FCD00465A17A448"/>they planted colonies, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the rude inhabitants ſome knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of their arts and improvements.</p>
               <p>The Jews, encouraged by the riches they ſaw the Phenecians acquiring from commerce ſeemed deſirous to endeavour to partake of it. Solomon fitted out fleets, which under the direction of Phenician pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, ſailed from the Red Sea to Tarſhiſh and Ophir; but the ſingular inſtitution of the Jews, the obſervance of which was enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Divine Legiſlator. with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of preſerving them a ſeparate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, uninſected by idolatry, prevented their being numbered among the nations, which contributed to improve navigation, or to make any material or uſeful diſoveries.</p>
               <p>The Carthagenians caught the ſpirit of commerce from the Phenecians and Jews. The commonwealth of Carthage applied to trade and naval aſſairs with the greateſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.

               <p>It is evident that the Phenicians, who inſtructed the Greeks in many uſeful arts and ſciences did not communitate to them that extenſive knowledge of navigation, which they themſelves poſſeſſed; nor did the Romans imbibe that commercial ſpirit and ardour for diſcovery, which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed their rivals the Carthagenians. Though Greece be almoſt encompaſſed by the ſea, which formed many ſpacious bays and commodious harbours: though it be ſurrounded by a vaſt number of fertile iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands, yet, notwithſtanding ſuch a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſituation, which ſeemed to invite that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious people to apply themſelves to navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, it was long before this art attained any degree of perfection among them. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the time, when the Greeks engaged in the famous enterprize againſt Troy, their knowledge in naval affairs ſeems not to have been much improved. Their veſſels were of inconſiderable burthen and moſtly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deeks. Theſe had only one maſt, and they were ſtrangers to the uſe of anchors. All their operations in ſailing were clumſy and unſkilful.</p>
               <p>The expedition of Alexander the Great into the Eaſt, conſiderably enlarged the ſphere of navigation and of geographical
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025348_0019_0FCD0049B1DB5610"/>knowledge among the Greeks. He found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great city, which he called Alexandria, near one of the mouths of the river Nile, that by the Mediterranean ſea, and the neighbourhood of the Arabian Gulf, it might command the trade both of the Eaſt and Weſt. This ſituation was choſen with ſuch diſcernment, that Alexandria ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the chief commercial city in the world.</p>
               <p>The progreſs made by the Romans in navigation and diſcovery, was ſtill more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable than that of the Greeks. The genius of the Roman people, their military education, and the ſpirit of their laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to diſcourage them from commerce and naval affairs. It was the neceſſity of oppoſing a formidable rival, not the deſire of extending trade, which firſt prompted them to aim at maritime power.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the Romans acquired a taſte for the luxuries of the Eaſt, the trade with India through Egypt was puſhed with new vigour, and carried on to greater extent. By frequenting the Indian continent, navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators became acquainted with the periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal courſe of the winds, which, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean that ſeparates Africa from India, blow with little variation during one half of the year from the Eaſt, and during the other half blow with equal ſteadineſs from the Weſt. Encouraged by this obſervation,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025348_0020_0FCD004B048E5220"/>they abandoned their ancient ſlow and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous courſe along the coaſt, and as ſoon as the weſtern monſoon ſet in took their departure from Ocelis, at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, and ſtretched boldly acroſs the ocean. The uniform direction of the wind, ſupplying the place of the compaſs, and rendering the guidance of the ſtars leſs neceſſary conducted them to the port of Muſiris, on the weſtern ſhore of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian continent—There they took on board their cargo, and returning with the eaſtern monſoon, finiſhed their voyage to the Arabian Gulf within the year. This part of India, now known by the name of the Malabar coaſt, ſeems to have been the utmoſt limits of ancient navigation in that quarter of the globe.</p>
               <p>The diſcovery of this new method of failing to India, is the moſt conſiderable improvement in navigation made by the Romans during the continuance of their power. In ancient times, the knowledge of remote countries was more frequently acquired by land than by ſea; and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, from their particular diſlike to mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time affairs, may be ſaid to have totally neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the latter, though a much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>y and expeditious.</p>
               <p>If we reject fabulous and obſcure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, if we cloſely abide by the light and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025348_0021_0FCD004CF9DAAB40"/>information of authentic hiſtory, without giving way to the conjectures of fancy, or the dreams of etymologiſts, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the knowledge which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients had acquired of the habitable globe was very confined and ſuperficial. In Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, the extenſive provinces in the eaſtern part of Germany were little known to them. They were almoſt totally unacquainted with the vaſt countries which are now ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the kings of Denmark, Sweden, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Poland, and the Ruſſian empire. The more barren regions, which ſtretch within the arctic circle were quite unexplored. In Africa, their reſearches did not extend far beyond the provinces which border on the Mediterranean, and thoſe ſituated on the weſtern ſhore of the Arabian Gulf. In Aſia, they were unacquained with all the fertile and delightful countries beyond the Ganges, which furniſh the moſt valuable commodities for the European commerce with India; nor do they ſeem to have ever penetrated into thoſe immenſe regions, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by the wandering tribes, which they called by the general name of Sycthians, and now poſſeſſed by Tartars of various denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inations, and by the Aſiatic Ruſſian ſubjects.</p>
               <p>But however imperfect or inaccurate the geographical knowledge which the Greeks and Romans had acquired may appear, in reſpect of the preſent improved ſtate of that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025348_0022_0FCD004F23E7F4A0"/>ſcience, their progreſs in diſcovery will ſeem conſiderable, and the extent to which they carried navigation and commerce, muſt be conſidered as great, when compared with the ignorance of early times. Geography continued to improve under the Romans ſo long as they remained in their powerful ſtate; But when the barbarians broke in upon them, the conſequence of luxury and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fferninacy, the ſciences then dwindled, and diſcoveries ceaſed to be made.</p>
               <p>Conſtantinople, after the deſtruction of the Roman empire, tho' often threatened by the fierce invaders, who ſpread deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over the reſt of Europe, was ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate as to eſcape their deſtructive rage. The knowledge of ancient arts and diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were preſerved in that city, a taſte for ſplendour and elegance ſtill ſubſiſted, the productions and luxuries of foreign coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries were in requeſt, and commerce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to flouriſh in Conſtantinople, when it was almoſt extinct in every other part of Europe.</p>
               <p>Much about the ſame time, a gleam of light and knowledge broke in upon the Eaſt. The Arabians, having contracted ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for the ſciences of the people whoſe empire they had contributed to overturn, tranſlated the books of ſeveral of the Greek philoſophers into their own language. The ſtudy of geography in courſe became an
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025348_0023_0FCD005043D137F8"/>early object of attention to the Arabians: but the acute and the ingenious people cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated chiefly the ſpeculative and ſcientific parts of geography. In order to aſcertain the figure and dimenſions of our earth, they applied the principles of geometry, they had recourſe, to aſtronomical obſervations, and employed experiments and operations, which Europe, in more enlightened times, have eagerly adopted and imitated.</p>
               <p>The calamities and deſolation brought upon the weſtern provinces of the Roman empire by its barbarous conquerors, by degrees were forgotten, and in ſome meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure repaired. The rude tribes which ſettled there, acquiring inſenſibly ſome idea of reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular government, and ſome reliſh for the functions and comforts of civil life. Europe awakened, in ſome degree, from its torpid and inactive ſtate, the firſt ſymptoms of which were diſcerned in Italy. The acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe rouſed induſtry, and gave motion and vigour to all the active powers of the human mind: foreign commerce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, navigation was attended to, and great pains taken to improve it.</p>
               <p>From that period, the commercial ſpirit of Italy became active and enterprizing. Venice, Genoa, and Piſa, roſe from incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable towns, to be populous and wealthy cities; their naval power encreaſed, their veſſels frequented not only all the ports in
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:025348_0024_0FCD0051CAA2CF10"/>the Mediterranean, but venturing ſometimes beyond the ſtraits, viſited the maritime towns of Spain, France, the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and England.</p>
               <p>While the cities of Italy were thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing in their career of improvement, an event happened, the moſt extraordinary perhaps in the hiſtory of mankind, which, inſtead of obſtructing the commercial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Italians, contributed to its encreaſe. The martial ſpirit of the Enro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, heightened and inflamed by religious zeal, prompted them to attempt the deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance of the Holy Land from the domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of infidels. Vaſt armies compoſed of all the nations in Europe, moved towards Aſia on this ſtrange enterpriſe. The Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſe. Piſans and Venetians furniſhed the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to carry them thither, and ſupphed them with proviſions and military ſtores. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the immenſe ſums which they received on this account they obtained commercial privileges and eſtabliſhments. From theſe ſources prodigious wealth flowed into the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties above mentioned This was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a proportional increaſe of power, and by the and of the Holy War, Venice, in particular, became a great maritime ſtate, poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſſing an extenſive commerce and ample territories.</p>
               <p>Communications being thus opened between Europe and the weſtern provinces
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025348_0025_0FCD005362C16660"/>of Aſia, ſeveral perſons were encouraged to advance far beyond the countries, in which the cruſaders carried on their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to travel by land into the more remote and opulent regions of the Eaſt. The wild fanaticiſms, which ſeem at that period to have mingled in all the ſchemes of individuals, no leſs than in all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of nations, firſt incited men to enter upon theſe long and dangerous excurſions. They were afterwards undertaken from proſpects of commercial advantage, or from motives of mere curioſity.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of this riſing deſire for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery a very fortunate event took place, which contributed more than all the efforts and ingenuity of preceeding ages to improve and extend navigation. That wonderful property of the magnet, by which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates ſuch virtue to a needle or ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der rod of iron, as to point towards the poles of the earth, was happily diſcovered. The uſe which might be made of this in directing navigation, was immediately perceived. From hence, that moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but now familiar inſtrument, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iners compaſs was formed. As ſoon as navigators found by means of this, that at all ſeaſons, and in every place, they could diſcover the North and South with ſo much eaſe and accuracy, it became no longer neceſſary to depend merely on the light of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025348_0026_0FCD0054F8DC9C30"/>the ſtars, and the obſervation of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt They gradually abandoned their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient timid and lingering courſe along the ſhore, launched boldly into the ocean, and relying on this new guide, could ſteer in the darkeſt night, and under the moſt cloudy ſky, with a ſecurity and preciſion hitherto unknown. The compaſs may be ſaid to have opened to man the dominion of the ſea, and to have put him in full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the earth, by enabling him to viſit every part of it.</p>
               <p>About the year 1365, Providence ſeemed to have decreed, that at this period men were to paſs the limits within which they had been ſo long confined, and open to themſelves a more ample field, wherein to diſplay their talents, their enterpriſe, and courage. The firſt conſiderable efforts towards this were not made by any of the more powerful ſtates of Europe, or by thoſe who had applied to navigation with the greateſt aſſiduity and ſucceſs. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of taking the lead in this bold attempt was reſerved for the Portugueſe, whoſe kingdom was the ſmalleſt and leaſt powerful o' any in Europe. As the attempts of the Portugueſe to acquire the knowledge of thoſe parts of the globe, with which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were then unacquainted, not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and extended the art of navigation, but rouſed ſuch a ſpirit of curioſity and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025348_0027_0FCD005640573FF0"/>enterprize, as led to the diſcovery of the New World, of which we are preſently to give the inſtory.</p>
               <p>Various circumſtances urged the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe to exert their activity in this new direction, and enab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed them to accompliſh undertakings apparently ſuperior to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force of their monarchy. John I. King of Portugal, ſurnamed the Baſtard, having obtained ſecure poſſeſſion of the crown, in the year 1411, ſoon perceived, that it would be impoſſible to preſerve pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic order, or domeſtic tranquility, without finding ſome employment for the reſtleſs ſpirit of his ſubjects. With this view, he aſſembled a numerous fleet at Liſbon, compoſed of all the ſhips he could fit out in his own kingdom, and of many hired from foreigners. This great armament fitted out in 1412, was deſtined to attack the Moors ſettled on the coaſts of Barbary. While the fleet was equipping, a few veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were appointed to ſail along the weſtern ſhore of Africa, bounded by the Atlantic ocean, and to diſcover the unknown coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries ſituated there.</p>
               <p>The particular ſituation of Portugal was an invitation to this new undertaking, and the genius of the age being favourable to the execution of it, it proved ſucceſsful. The veſſels ſent on the diſcovery doubled the formidable Cape Non, which had ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025348_0028_0FCD00581954F470"/>the progreſs of former navigators, and proceeded one hundred and ſixty miles bevond it, to Cape Bojador. As its rocky cliffs, which ſtretched a conſiderable way into the Atlantic, appeared more dreadful than the promontory they had paſſed, the Portugueſe commander was afraid to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſail round it, but returned to Lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, more ſatisfied with having advanced ſo far, than aſhamed of not having gone further.</p>
               <p>Though this voyage was in itſelf incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, yet it increaſed the paſſion for diſcovery, which began to ſhew itſelf in Portugal. The fortunate iſſue of the king's expedition againſt the Moors of Barbary, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſtrength to that ſpirit in the nation, and puſhed it on to new undertakings. In order to render theſe ſucceſsful, it was neceſſary, that they ſhould be conducted by a perſon who poſſeſſed abilities capable of diſcerning what was attainable, who enjoyed leiſure to form a regular ſyſtem for proſecuting diſcovery, and who was animated with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, that would perſevere in ſpite of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles and repulſes: happil; for Portugal, ſhe found all theſe qualities in Henry duke of Viſeo, the fourth ſon of King John. That prince, in his early youth having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his father in his expedition to Barbary, diſtinguiſhed himſelf by many deeds of valour. To the marſhal ſpirit,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025348_0029_0FCD005951D41E10"/>which was the characteriſtic of every man of noble birth at that period, he added all the accompliſhment of a more enlightened and poliſhed age. He cultivated the arts and ſciences, which were then little known, and deſpiſed by perſons of his exalted ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was particularly fond of the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of geography, and he early acquired ſuch a knowledge of the habitable globe, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the great probability of finding new and opulent countries, by ſailing along the coaſt of Africa.</p>
               <p>The commencement of every new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking isuſually attended with trifling ſucceſs. In the year 1418, he fitted out a ſingle ſhip, and gave the command of it to two gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of his houſehold, who offered themſelves as volunteers to conduct the enterpriſe. He inſtructed them to double Cape Bojador, and thence to ſteer towards the ſouth. They held their courſe along the ſhore, the mode of navigation which ſtill prevailed, when a ſudden ſquall of wind aroſe, which drove them out to ſea, and, when they expected every moment to periſh, it blew thein on an unknown iſland, which, from their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py eſcape, they armed Porto San<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o. They inſtantly returned to Portugal with the news of their diſcovery, and were received by Henry with the applauſe and honour due to fortunate adventurers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:025348_0030_0FCD005B7A09C9C0"/>
The next year Henry ſent out three ſhips under the ſame commanders, in order to make a ſettlement in Porto Santo. From this iſland they obſerved towards the ſouth a fixed ſpot in the horizon, like a ſmall black cloud. They were by degrees led to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture it might be land, and ſteering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, they arrived at a conſiderable iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and, uninhabited and covered with wood, which on that account they called Madeira. As it was Henry's principal object to rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er his diſcoveries uſeful to his country, he immediately equiped a fleet to carry a colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Portugueſe to theſe iſlands. He took care that they ſhould be furniſhed not only with the ſeeds, plants, and domeſtic animals common in Europe, but, as he foreſaw that the warmth of the climate and fertility of the ſoil, would prove favorable to the rearing of other productions, he procured ſlips of the vine from the iſland of Cyprus, the rich wines of which were then in great requeſt, and plants of the ſugar cane from Sicily, into which it had been recently introduced.— Theſe throve ſo proſperouſly in this new country, that the advantage of their culture was immediately perceived, and the ſugar and wine of Madeira, ſoon became conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable articles of commerce, from which the Portugueſe derived great advantage.</p>
               <p>Theſe important ſucceſſes gave a ſpur to the ſpirit of diſcovery, and induced the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025348_0031_0FCD005E1C1B3C78"/>Portugueſe, inſtead of ſervilely creeping along the coaſt, to venture into the open ſea. They doubled Cape Bojador, in 1433, and advanced within the tropics. In the courſe of a ſew years they diſcovered the river Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal, and all the coaſt extending from Cape Blanco, to Cape de Verde.</p>
               <p>The Portugueſe had hitherto been guided in their diſcoveries, or encouraged to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt them, by the light and information they received from the works of the ancient mathematicians and geographers; but when they began to enter the torrid zone, the notions which prevailed among the ancients that the heat was ſo intenſe as to render it inſupportable, detered them, for ſome time, from proceeding. However, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe unfavorable appearances, in 1449 the Portugueſe diſcovered the Cape de Verde iſlands, which lie off the promontory of that name, and ſoon after the iſles called Azores. As the former of theſe are above three hundred miles from the African coaſt, and the latter nine hundred miles from any continent, it is evident that the Portugueſe had made great advances in the art of navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
               <p>The paſſion for diſcoveries received an unfortunate check by the death of Prince Henry, whoſe ſuperior knowledge had hitherto directed all the operations of the diſcoverers &amp; whoſe patronage had encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025348_0032_0FCD005F414DA610"/>and protected them. However notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the advantages they derived from hence, the Portugueſe, during his life, did not advance, in their utmoſt progreſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſouth, within five degrees of the equinoctial line; and after their continued exertions for half a century, hardly 1500 miles of the coaſt of Africa was diſcovered.</p>
               <p>The Portugueſe in 1471, ventured to croſs the line, and, to their aſtoniſhment, found that region of the torid zone, which was ſuppoſed to be ſcorched with intolerable heat, to the habitable, populous, and fertile.</p>
               <p>Under the direction of John II. in 1484, a powerful fleet was fitted out, which ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vanced above fifteen hundred miles beyond the line, and the Portugueſe, for the firſt time beheld a new heaven, and obſerved the ſtars of another hemiſphere.</p>
               <p>By their conſtant intercourſe with the people of Africa, they gradually acquired ſome knowledge of thoſe parts of that country, which they had not viſited. The information they received from the natives. added to what they had obſerved in their own voyages, began to open proſpects of a more extenſive nature. They ſound, as they proceeded ſouthward, that the continent of Africa, inſtead of extending in breadth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of Prolemy, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſenſibly to contract itſelf and to bend towards the eaſt. This induced them to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025348_0033_0FCD0060C3555520"/>give credit to the ancient Phenician voyages round Africa, which had long been conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as fabulous, and gave them reaſon to hope, that by following the ſame route, they might arrive at the Eaſt Indies, and engroſs that commerce, which had ſo long contrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted to enrich other powers.</p>
               <p>In 1486, the conduct of a voyage for this purpoſe, the moſt dangerous and difficult the Portugueſe had ever embarked in, was entruſted to Barthelomew Diaz, who ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boldly towards the ſouth, and proceeding beyond the utmoſt limits to which his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen had hitherto advanced diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near a thouſand miles of a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>country. Neither the combined powers of violent tempeſts, and the frequent mutinies of his crew, nor even the calamities of famine, which he ſuffered from loſing his ſtore ſhip, could deter him from the purſuit of his grand object. In ſpite of all, he at laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that lofty promontory which bounds Africa to the ſouth; but he did nothing more than diſcover it. The violence of the winds, the ſhattered condition of his ſhips, and the turbulent ſpirit of his ſailors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to return after a voyage of 16 months. The king of Portugal, as he now entertained no doubt of having found the long deſired route to India, gave this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory the name of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:025348_0034_0FCD0062B07837E8"/>
Theſe ſanguine ideas of ſucceſs were ſtrengthened by the intelligence the king received over land, in conſequence of his embaſſy to Abyſſinia. Covillam and Payva, by the King's inſtructions, had repaired to Grand Cairo. From this city they traveled in company with a caravan of Egyptian merchants, and embarking on the Red Sea, arrived at Arden, in Arabia. There they ſeparated; Payva ſailed directly towards Abyſſinia; Covillam embarked for the Eaſt Indies, and having viſited Calecut, Goa, and other cities of the Malabar coaſt, returned to Sofala, on the eaſt ſide of Africa, and thence to Crand Cairo, which Payva and be had fixed upon as their place of meeting. The former however was unfortunately and cruelly murdered in Abyſſinia: but Covil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam found at Cairo two Portugueſe Jews, whom the King of Portugal had diſpatched after them, in order to receive an account of their proceedings, and to communicate to them new inſtructions. By one of theſe Jews Covillam tranſmitted to Portugal a journal of his proceedings by ſea and land, his remarks upon the trade of India, togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with exact maps of the coaſt on which he had toutched; and from what he himſelf had obſerved, as well as from the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſkillful ſeamen in different countries, he concluded, that by ſailing round Africa, a paſſage might be found to the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025348_0035_0FCD0063C2C820B0"/>The happy coincidence of Covillam's report and opinion with the diſcoveries lately made by Diaz, left hardly any ſhadow of doubt with reſpect to the poſſibility of failing from Europe. However, the vaſt length of the voyage, and the furious ſtorms, which Diaz had encountered near the Cape of Good Hope, alarmed and intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated the Portugueſe to ſuch a degree, although they were become adventurous and ſkilful mariners, that ſome time was requiſite to prepare their minds for this dangerous and extraordinary voyage.</p>

               <p>CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS, a ſubject of the republic of Genoa, was among the foremoſt of thoſe foreigners whom the fame of the diſcoveries made by the Portugueſe had allured into their ſervice. Though neither the time nor place of his birth are certainly known, yet it is on all hands agreed, that he was deſcended from an honourable family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to indigence by misfortunes. As his anceſtors were accuſtomed to a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring life, Columbus became naturally fond of it himſelf, and very early diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe talents for that profeſſion, which plainly indicated the great man he was one day to be. He applied with uncommon ardour to the ſtudy of the Latin tongue. geography, aſtronomy, and the art of drawing. Thus qualified, in 1461, at the age of fourteen, he went to ſea, and began his career on that element, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to ſo much glory.</p>
               <p>In 1467, he repaired to Liſbon, where many of his countrymen were ſettled. They ſoon conceived ſuch a favourable opinion of his merit and talents, that they warmly ſolicited him to remain in their kingdom, where his naval ſkill and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025348_0037_0FCD0066F767CEB0"/>could not fail of rendering him conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>To find out a paſſage by ſea to the Eaſt Indies, was the great object in view at that period. From the time that the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe doubled Cape de Verde, this was the point at which they aimed in all their navigations. The tediouſneſs of the courſe, which the Portugueſe were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing, naturally led Columbus to conſider, whether a ſhorter and more direct paſſage to the Eaſt Indies, than that projected by ſailing round the African continent, might not be found out. After revolving long and ſeriouſly every cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umſtance ſuggeſted by his ſuperior knowledge in the theory, as well as practice of navigation, after comparing attentively the obſervations of modern pilots, with the hints and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures of ancient authors, he at laſt concluded, that by ſailing directly towards the Weſt, acroſs the Atlantic ocean, new countries, which probably fomed a part of the vaſt continent of India, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly be diſcovered</p>
               <p>Filled with theſe ideas, he laid his ſcheme before the ſenate of Genoa, and making his country the firſt tender of his ſervice, offered to fail under the banners of the republic, in queſt of the new regions he expected to diſcover, but they inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025348_0038_0FCD00696C924F10"/>rejected his propoſal, as a dream of a chimerical projector He then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his plan to the Portugueſe, who endeavoured to rob him of the honour, by ſending another perſon privately to purſue the ſame track propoſed be him; but the pilot, choſen to execute Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus's plan, had neither the genius not the fortitude of its author. Contrary winds aroſe, no ſight of approaching land ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, his courage failed, and he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Liſbon, execrating a plan, which he had not abilities to execute.</p>
               <p>Columbus no ſooner diſcovered this diſhonorable treatment, than he inſtantly quitted Portugal in diſguſt, and repaired to Spain about the cloſe of the year 1484. Here he reſolved to propoſe it in perſon to Ferdinand and Iſabella, who at that time governed the united kingdoms of Caſtile and Arragon. He alſo ſent his brother to England, to propoſe his plan to Henry VIII.</p>
               <p>After a long ſucceſſion of mortifying cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and diſappointments, Iſabella was perſuaded to ſend for Columbus to court. The cordial reception he there met with from the queen, together with the near proſpect of ſetting out upon that voyage, which had ſo long been the object of his thoughts and wiſhe, ſoon effaced
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025348_0039_0FCD006A83828F40"/>the remembrance of all that he had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Spain, during eight tedious years of ſolicitation and ſuſpence. The negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now went forward rapidly, and a treaty with Columbus was ſigned on the 17th of April, 1492.</p>

The largeſt, a ſhip of no conſiderable burden, was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Columbus, as admiral, who gave it the name or Santa Maria. Of the ſecond, called the Pinta, Martin Pinzon was captain, and his brother Francis pilot. The third, named the Nigna, was under the command of Vincent Yanez Pinzon.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025348_0041_0FCD006ED6F08B18"/>Theſe two were light veſſels, hardly ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior in burden or force to large boats. The ſum employed in the whole of this equipment did not exceed 4000 l.</p>
               <p>On the 3d day of Auguſt, 1492. Columbus ſet ſail, a little before ſun-riſe in preſence of a vaſt crowd of ſpectators, who ſent up their ſupplications to heaven for the proſperous iſſue of the voyage, which they wiſhed rather than expected. Columbus ſteered directly for the Canary Iſlands, from whence he departed on the 6th of September. In the ſhort run to the Canaries, the ſhips were found to be ſo crazy and ill appointed, as to be very improper for a navigation, which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be both long and dangerous.</p>
               <p>Columbus, on leaving the Canaries, held his courſe due weſt, left immediately the uſual track of navigation, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into unfrequented and unknown ſeas. By the 14th of September, the fleet was about two hundred leagues to the Weſt of the Canary iſlands, at a greater Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025348_0042_0FCD007096F08B18"/>to ariſe from the ignorance and timidity of the people under his command. All the art and addreſs he was maſter of was hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient to quell the mutinous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſailors; who grew the more turbulent, in proportion as their diſtance encreaſed from home.</p>
               <p>On the 11th of October, Columbus was ſo confident of being near land, that he ordered the ſails to be furled, and the ſhips to lie by, keeping ſtrict watch, leſt they ſhould be driven on ſhore in the night. During this interval of ſuſpence and expectation, no man ſhut his eyes, all kept upon deck, gazing intently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that quarter where they expected to diſcover the land, which had been ſo long the object of their wiſhes. A little after midnight, the joyful ſound of <hi>land! land!</hi> was heard from the Pinta, which kept always a-head of the other ſhips; but, having been ſo often deceived by fallacious appearances, every man was now become ſlow of belief, and waited, in all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of uncertainty and impatience, for the return of day.</p>
               <p>On the 12th of October, as ſoon as morning dawned, all doubts and fears were diſpelled. From every ſhip an iſland was ſeen about two leagues to the North, whoſe flat and verdant fields, well ſtored
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025348_0043_0FCD00714764D668"/>with wood, and watered with many riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulets, preſented the aſpect of a delightful country. The crew of the Pinta inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly began the <hi>Te Deum,</hi> as a hymn of thankſgiving to God, and were joined by thoſe of the other ſhips, with tears of joy and tranſports of congratulation. They then on their knees begged pardon of Columbus for the mutinous ſpirit they had ſhewn, acknowledged his ſuperior abilities, and promiſed implicit obedience to his will in ſuture.</p>
               <p>The boats being manned and armed as ſoon as the ſun aroſe, they rowed towards the iſland with their colours diſplayed, warlike muſic, and other martial pomp. As they approached the coaſt, they ſaw it covered with a multitude of people, whom the novelty of the ſpectacle had drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, whoſe attitudes and geſtures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed wonder and aſtoniſhment at the ſtrange objects-before them. He landed in a rich dreſs, with a ſword in his hand. His men followed, and kneeling down, they all kiſſed the ground which they had ſo long deſired to ſee. They then took ſolemn poſſeſſion of the country for the crown of Caſtile and Leon.</p>
               <p>The dreſs of the Spaniards, the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or their ſkins, their beards, their arms, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025348_0044_0FCD0072C6A994E8"/>natives. The vaſt machines in which they had traverſed the ocean, that ſeemed to move upon the water with wings, and uttered a dreadful ſound reſembling thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, accompanied with lightning &amp; ſmoke, ſtruck them with ſuch tenor, that they began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>onſider them as children of the Sun, who had deſcended to viſit mortals here below.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards were no leſs ſurpriſed at the novelty of their ſituation. Every herb, ſhrub, and tree, was different from thoſe which flouriſhed in Europe. The inhabitants appeared in the ſimple inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of nature, entirely naked. Their black hair, long and uncurled, floated upon their ſhoulders, or was bound in treſſes round their Leads. They had no beards, and every part of their bodies was perfectly ſmooth. Their complexion was of a duſky copper colour, their features ſingular, rather than diſagreeable, and their aſpect gentle and timid. They were at firſt ſhy through fear, but ſoon be, came familiar with the Spaniards, and with tranſports of joy received from them hawks bells, glaſs beads, or other baubles, in return for which they gave ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions as they had, and ſome cotton yarn, the only commodity of value that they could produce. Thus in the firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025348_0045_0FCD00743A52C940"/>between the inhabitants of the new and old worlds, every thing was conducted amicably and to their mutual ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Columbus now aſſumed the title and authority of admiral and viceroy, and called the iſland he had diſcovered San Salvador. It is one of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>It ſoon appeared evident to Columbus that this was but a poor plare, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not the object of his purſuit. But, conformably to his theory concerning the diſcovery of thoſe regions of Aſia, which ſtretched towards the eaſt, he concluded that San Salvador was one of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, that moſt of the people whom he had ſeen wore ſmall plates of gold, by way of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in their noſtrils, he eagerly enquired where they got that precious metal. They pointed towards the ſouth, and made him comprehend by ſigns, that gold abounded in countries ſituated in that quarter.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of this intelligence, he ſailed to the ſouthward and ſaw ſeveral
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025348_0046_0FCD0075B8045500"/>Iſlands. He touched at thoſe of the largeſt, on which he beſtowed the names of St. Mary, Fernandina, and Iſabella; but, as all his enquiries were after gold, and none of them produced any, he made no ſtay in any of them. He afterwards diſcovered Cuba, and ſoon after fell in with Hiſpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iola.</p>
               <p>Columbus, ſtill intent on diſcovering the mines which yielded gold, ſailed from hence on the 24th of December, 1492. The great variety of buſineſs in which he was engaged having prevented Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus from taking any ſleep for two days, he retired at midnight to take ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, having committed the helm to the pilot, with ſtrict injunction not to quit it for a moment. The pilot dreading no danger, careleſsly left the helm to an unexperienced cabin-boy, and the ſhip, carried away by a current, was daſhed againſt a rock. The violence of the ſhock awaked Columbus. He ran up to the deck, where all was confuſion and deſpair, he alone retaining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The boats from the Nigna ſaved the crew, and the natives in their canoes did every thing in their power to ſerve them, by
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025348_0047_0FCD0077F927BAA8"/>whoſe aſſiſtance they ſaved almoſt every thing that was valuable.</p>
               <p>The diſtreſs of Columbus was at this time very great. The Pinta had failed away from him, and he ſuſpected was treacherouſly gone to Europe. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained but one veſſel, and that the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt and moſt crazy of the ſquadron, to traverſe ſuch a vaſt oce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He reſolved therefore to leave a part of his crew on the iſland, that, by reſiding there, they might learn the language of the natives, ſtudy their diſpoſitions, ſearch for mines, and prepare for the commodious ſettlement of the colony, with which he propoſed to return. Having ſettled this buſineſs with his men and the natives, he built a fort, and placed in it the guns ſaved out of his own ſhip. He appointed thirty-eight of his people to remain on the iſland, under the command of Diego de Arada, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with every thing requiſite for the ſubſiſtence or defence of the infant colony.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſettled matters, he left Navidad on the 4th of January, 1493, and ſtretching towards he eaſt, diſcovered and gave names to moſt of the harbors on the northern coaſt of the iſland. On t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Pinzon endeavored to juſtify his conduct, and though Columbus was by no means ſatisfied in his own mind, yet he thought it prudent to diſſemble at preſent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly received him again into favour.

               <p>Columbus now found it neceſſary, from the condition of his ſhips, and the temper of his men, to return to Europe.

Every mark of honor, that gratitude or admiration could ſuggeſt, was conferred upon Columbus. Letters patent were iſſued, confirming-to him and his heirs all the privileges contained in the capitulation concluded at Santa Fe; his family was enobled, and the king, queen, and courtiers, treated him as a perſon of the higheſt rank. But what pleaſed him moſt was an order to equip, without delay, an armanent of ſuch force, as might enable him not only to take poſſeſſion of the countries he had already diſcovered, but to go in ſearch of thoſe more opulent regions, which he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently expected to find.</p>
               <p>Cautious as Ferdinand was, and averſe to every thing new and adventurous, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for a ſecond expediton were carried on with a rapidity unuſual in Spain, and to an extent that would be deemed not inconſiderable in the preſent age.

Every thing being ready, Columbus ſet ſail from the bay of Cadiz on the 25th of September, 1493, and arrived at Hiſpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iola on the 22d of November. When he appeared off Navidad, from the ſtation in which he had left the thirty-eight men under the command or Arada, he was aſtoniſhed that none of them appeared, and expected every moment to ſee them runing with tranſports of joy to welcome their countrymen. But he ſoon found, that the imprudent and licentious beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of his men had rouſed the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the natives, who at laſt deſtroyed them all and burned their fort.</p>
               <p>He then traced out the plan of a town in a large plain, near a ſpacious bay, and obliged every perſon to put his hand to a work on which their common ſafety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended. This riſing city, the firſt that the Europeans founded in the new World, he named Iſabella, in honour of his pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneſs the queen of Caſtile.</p>
               <p>His followers loudly complained of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to turn builders, where they expected to meet with riches and luxuries.

During a tedious voyage of full five months, he had a trial of almoſt all the numerous hardſhips, to which perſons of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion are expoſed, without making any diſcovery of importance, except the iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and of Jamaica.</p>
               <p>On his return to Hiſpaniola, he met with his brother Bartholomew at Iſabella, after an abſence of near thirteen years, which gave him inexpreſſible joy. He could not have arrived more ſeaſonably, as the ſpaniards were not only threatened with famine but even with an inſurrection of the natives owing to the ſhameful lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties the new ſettlers took with the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and property of the Indians, who united their forces to drive theſe formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable invaders from the ſettlements, of which they had violently taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</p>

Such an impoſition was extremely contrary to thoſe maxims which Columbus had hitherto inculcated, with reſpect to the mode of treating them.</p>

The condition of the Indians became inſupportable, and they endeavoured to ſtarve the Spaniards, by deſtroying all the produce of the earth, and then retired to the mountains. This reduced the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards to extreme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

               <p>Columbus finding he had many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the court of Spain, reſolved to return home in order to juſtify himſelf, leaving his brother Bartholomew as lieut. governor, and Francis Roldon chief juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He was received at court, on his arrival, with ſo many marks of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after having perfectly cleared up his conduct, as made his enemies aſhamed of themſelves, and it was reſolved to ſend him on diſcoveries a third time.</p>
               <p>After innumerable diſappointments and delays, he ſailed on his third voyage on the 30th day of May, 1398. His ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron conſiſted of ſix ſhips only, of no great burden, and but indifferently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ſo long and dangerous a naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>He ſailed in a different direction to what he had hitherto done, in order to fall in with the coaſt of India. On the 1ſt

               <p>Many revolutions had happened in that country during his abſence. His brother, the deputy governor, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the advice the admiral gave him before his departure, had removed the colony from Iſabella to a more commod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious ſtation, on the oppoſite ſide of the iſland, and laid the foundation of St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo. The natives were ſoon after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Spaniſh yoke, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo oppreſſive to them, that they roſe in their own defence, but were eaſily conquered. At the ſame time, Roldon, whom Columbus had placed in a ſtation, which required him to be the guardian of order and tranquility, perſuaded the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to riſe in arms.</p>
               <p>Such was the diſtracted ſtate of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony when Columbus arrived at St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo, but his wiſdom and moderation ſoon brought every thing to order.</p>

While Columbus was thus engaged in the weſt, the ſpirit of diſcovery did not languiſh in Portugal. Emmanuel, who inherited the enterprizing genius of his predeceſſors, perſiſted in their grand ſcheme of opening a paſſage to the Eaſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndies by the Cape of Good Hope, and ſoon after his acceſſion to the throne he equiped a ſquadron for that important voyage. He gave the command of it to Vaſco de Gama, a man of noble birth, poſſeſſed of virtue, prudence, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, equal to the ſtation. The ſquadron like all thoſe ſited out for diſcovery in the infancy of navigation, was extremely feeble, conſiſting only of three veſſels, of neither burthen nor force adequate to the ſervice.</p>
               <p>He ſet ſail from Liſbon on the 9th of July, 1497, and ſtanding towards the South, had to ſtruggle for four months with contrary winds, before he could reach the Cape of Good Hope: Here their violence began to abate, and during an interval of calm weather, in the latter end of November, Gama doubled that formidable promontory, which had ſo long been the boundary of navigation, and directed his courſe towards the northeaſt, along the African coaſt. He touched at ſeveral ports, and after various adventures
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025348_0054_0FCD00827B56DF48"/>came to an anchor before the city of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leida. Gama now purſued his voyage with almoſt abſolute certainty of ſucceſs, and under the conduct of a Mahome an pilot he arrived at Calecut, upon the coaſt of Malabar, on the 22d of May, 1498.</p>
               <p>What he beheld of the wealth, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſneſs, the cultivation, the induſtry, and arts of this highly civilized country, far exceeded any idea that he had formed from the imperfect accounts which the Europeans had hitherto received of it. But as he poſſeſſed neither ſufficient force to attempt a ſettlement, nor proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities with which he could carry on commerce of any conſequence, he haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened back to Portugal, with an account of his ſucceſs in performing a voyage the longeſt, as well as the moſt difficult, that had ever been made ſince the firſt inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of navigation. He landed at Liſbon on the 14th of September, 1499, two years, two months, and five days from the time he left that port.</p>
               <p>Amerigo Veſpucci, a Florentine gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, having accompanied Ojeda in a voyage to the new world, on his return tranſmited an account of his adventures and diſcoveries to one of his countrymen, and labouring with the vanity of a trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller to magnify his own exploits, he had

                  </gap>ative, ſo as to make it appear, that he had the glory of having firſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the continent in the new world. The country, of which Amerigo was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be diſcoverer, came gradually to be called by his name. By the univerſal conſent of nations, America is the name beſtowed on this new quarter of the globe. The bold pretenſions of a fortunate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor have robbed the diſcoverer of the new world of a diſtinction which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. The name of Amerigo has ſupplanted that of Columbus, and it is now too late to redreſs the injury.</p>
               <p>During the laſt year of the fourteenth century, Pedro Alvarez Cabral was fitted out by the king of Portugal in order to carry on trade or attempt conqueſts in India, to which place Gama had juſt ſhewn them the way. In order to avoid the coaſt of Africa, where he was certain of meeting with variable breezes, or fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent calms, which might retard his voyage, Cabral ſtood out to ſea, and kept ſo far to the weſt, that, to his ſurprize, he found himſelf upon the ſhore of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known country, in the tenth degree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the line. The country with which he fell in belongs to that province in South America, now known by the name of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025348_0058_0FCD0089377F0418"/>Braſil. He landed, and having formed a very high idea of the fertility of the ſoil, and agreeableneſs of the climate, he took poſſeſſion of it for the crown of Portugal. and diſpatched a ſhip to Liſbon with an account of this event, which appeared to be no leſs important than it was unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>While the Spaniards and Portugueſe were daily acquiring more enlarged ideas of the extent and opulence of that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the globe which Columbus had made known to them, he himſelf, far from enjoying the tranquility and honors, with which his ſervices ſhould have been recompenſed, was ſtrugling with every diſtreſs, in which the envy and malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the people under his command, or the ingratitude of the court which he ſerved could involve him.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the court of Spain became prejudiced againſt Columbus, a fatal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution was taken. Francis de Bovadilla, a knight of Calatrava, was appointed to repair to Hiſpaniola, with full powers to enquire into the conduct of Columbus; and, if he ſhould find the charge of mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adminiſtration proved, to ſupercede him, and aſſume the government of the iſland, It was impoſſible to eſcape when this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous commiſſion, made it the intereſt
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025348_0059_0FCD008AC0381378"/>the judge to pronounce the perſon, whom he was ſent to try, guilty of every charge. What followed cannot at all appear ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing; Columbus was ſent to Spain loaded with chains. Fortunately, his voyage to Spain was extremely ſhort, where he arrived on the 23d of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1500.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as Ferdinand and Iſabella, were informed that Columbus was brought home a priſoner, and in chains, they were aſhamed of their conduct and dreaded the cenſure of all Europe. They inſtantly iſſued orders to ſet Columbus at liberty, invited him to court, and remited him money to enable him to appear there in a manner ſuitable to his rank. On his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at court, the modeſt manner in which he told his tale, and related his grievances, were felt by every one, the new governor of Hiſpaniola was recalled, and Ovando was ſent in his room.</p>
               <p>While the neceſſary ſteps were taking for ſecuring the proſperity and welfare of the colony which Columbus had planted, he himſelf was engaged in the unpleaſant employment of ſoliciting the favour of an ungrateful court, and notwithſtanding all his merit and ſervices he ſolicited in vain. After attending the court of Spain for near two years, as an humble ſuitor, he
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025348_0060_0FCD008CAB6C5928"/>found it impoſſible to remove Ferdinand's prejudices and apprehenſions, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at length, that he laboured in vain, when he urged a claim of juſtice or merit with an intereſted, ungenerous, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling prince.</p>
               <p>However, Columbus, at laſt, prevailed on the court of Spain to fit him out on his fourth expedition, which they were perſuaded to embark in, on the promiſed hope of his finding out a ſhorter and ſafer route to the Eaſt Indies. He accordingly ſailed from Cadiz, on the 9th of May, 1502, with only four ſmall barks, the largeſt of which did not exceed ſeventy tons in burthen. On his arrival at Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola, he met with the moſt ungener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous treatment from Ovando, who would not ſuffer him to enter their harbours.</p>
               <p>After various and fruitleſs attempts to diſcover a paſſage to the Indian ocean, Columbus met with all the diſaſters to which navigation is expoſed. Furious hurricanes, with violent ſtorms or thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning, threatened his deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion, and at laſt drove him on the coaſt of Jamaica, where his little crazy fleet was wrecked, on the 24th of June, 1503.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>THE colony of Hiſpaniola, before the death of Columbus, had gradually acquired the form of a regular and proſperous ſtate. The humane ſolicitude of Iſabella to protect the indians from oppreſſion, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the proclamation, by which the Spaniards were prohibited to compel them to work, for ſome time, it is true, retarded the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of improvement. The natives conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering every exemption from toil as a ſupreme felicity, deſpiſed every allurement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by which they were invited to labour. The Spaniards were not numerous enough, either to work the mines or cultivate the ſoil, the diſtempers peculiar to the climate hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carried off great numbers.</p>
               <p>In order to ſave the colony from ruin, Ovando ventured to relax the rigour of ſome royal edicts that had been ſent to him. He made a new diſtribution of the indians among the Spaniards, and compelled them to labour for a ſtated time, in digging the mines, or in cultivating the grounds; but in order to ſcrene himſelf from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of having ſubjected them again to ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude, he enjoined their maſters to pay them a certain ſum, as the price of their work. But the indians, after enjoying reſpite from oppreſſion, though during a ſhort interval,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025348_0065_0FCD0096110EF568"/>now found the yoke of bondage to be ſo galling, that they made ſeveral attempts to vindicate their own liberty. However they were ſubdued as often as they roſe, and the treatment they received from Ovando was both cruel and treacherous.</p>
               <p>The attention of the Spaniards was ſo much engroſſed by their operations in the mines of Hiſpaniola, that the ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery languiſhed for ſome time. In 1508 Juan Ponce de Leon, who commanded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Ovando, in the eaſtern diſtrict of Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola, paſſed over to the iſland of St. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an de Puerto Rico, which Columbus had diſcovered in his ſecond voyage, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into the interior parts of the country. As he found the ſoil to be fertile, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, from ſymptoms, as well as from the information of the inhabitants, to diſcover mines of gold in the mountains, Ovando permited him to attempt making a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the iſland. In a few years, Puerto Rico was ſubjected to the Spaniſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the natives were reduced to ſervitude, and being treated with the ſame inconſiderate rigor as their neighbors in Hiſpaniola, the race of original inhabitants worn out with fatigue and ſufferings, was ſoon exterminated.</p>
               <p>Sebaſtian de Ocampo, by the command of Ovando, ſailed round Cuba, and firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, with certainty, that this country,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025348_0066_0FCD0097F4DF4F10"/>which Columbus once ſuppoſed to be a part of the continent was only a large iſland.</p>
               <p>This voyage round Cuba was one of the laſt occurrences under the adminiſtration of Ovando. Ever ſince the death of Columbus, his ſon Don Diego had been employed in ſoliciting Ferdinand to grant him the offices of Viceroy and Admiral in the New World, together with all the other immunities and profits which deſcended to him by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, in conſequence of the original capitulation with his father. But if theſe dignities and revenues appeared ſo conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Ferdinand, that, at the expence of being deemed unjuſt, as well as ungrateful, he had wreſted them from Columbus, it is not ſurprizing that he ſhould be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to confer them on his ſon. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly Don Diego waſted two years in inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant but fruitleſs importunity. Weary of this, he endeavoured at length to obtain, by a legal ſentence, what he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the favour of an intereſted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. He commenced a ſuit againſt Ferd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inand before the council which managed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian affairs, and that court with an integrity which reflects honour upon its proceedings, decided againſt the king, and confirmed all the privileges ſtipulated in the capitulation. Ferdinand ſtill ſhewed his repugnance to do Diego juſtice, nor would he at laſt have done any thing had he not been in a manner forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025348_0067_0FCD00992E521010"/>to it by a powerful party, raiſed in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the marriage of Don Diego with Donna Maria, daughter of Don Ferdinand, great commendator of Leon, and brother of the Duke of Alva, a nobleman of the firſt rank and nearly related to the king. The duke and his family eſpouſed ſo warmly the cauſe of their new ally, that Ferdinand could not reſiſt their ſolicitations.</p>
               <p>In 1509, he recalled Ovando, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Don Diego his ſucceſſor, though even in conferring this favour he could not conceal his jealouſy; for he allowed him to aſſume only the title of governor and not that of vice-roy.</p>
               <p>Don Diego immediately ſet off for Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola, attended by his brother, his uncle, his wife, whom the courteſy of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards honoured with the title of Vicequeen, and a numerous retinue of both ſexes, born of good families. He lived with a ſplendor and magnificence hitherto unknown in the new world, and the family of Columbus ſeemed now to enjoy the honors and rewards due to his inventive genius of which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had been cruelly defrauded. The colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny itſelf acquired new luſtre by the acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo many inhabitants of a different rank and character from moſt of thoſe who had hitherto emigrated to America, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the moſt illuſtrious families in the Spaniſh ſettlements are deſcended from the

               <p>Juan Diaz de Solis, about this time ſet out in conjunction with Pinzon, upon new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries. They ſailed due ſouth, towards the equinoxial line, which Pinzon had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly croſſed, and advanced as far as the 40th degree of ſouthern latitude. They were aſtoniſhed to find that the continent of America ſtretched on the right hand, thro' all this vaſt extent of ocean. They landed in different places, to taken poſſeſſion in the name of their ſovereign; but though the country appeared to be extremely fertile and inviting, their force was ſo ſmall, having been fited out rather for diſcovery than mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſettlements, that they left no colony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them Their voyage however, ſerved to give the Spaniards more exalted and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate ideas, with reſpect ta the dimenſions of the new world.</p>
               <p>Private adventurers attempted to make ſettlements on the new continent; but the loſs of their ſhips by various accidents upon unknown coaſts, the diſeaſes peculiar to a climate the moſt noxious in all America, the want of proviſions, unavoidable in a country imperfectly cultivated, diſſentions among themſelves, and the inceſſant hoſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of the natives, involved them in a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of calamities, the bare recital of which would ſtrike my readers with horror.</p>

Notwithſtanding the unfortunate iſſue of this expedition, the Spaniards were not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from engaging in new ſchemes of a ſimilar nature. Juan Ponce de Leon, in 1512, fitted out three ſhips at his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for a voyage of diſcovery, and his reputation ſoon drew together a reſpectable body of followers. He directed his courſe towards the Lucayo iſlands; and, after touching at ſeveral of them, as well as of the Bahama iſles, he ſtood to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, and diſcovered a country hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Spaniards, which he called Florida, either becauſe he fell in with it on Palm Sunday, or on account of its gay and beautiful appearance. He attempted to land in different places, but met with ſuch vigorous oppoſition from the natives, who were fierce and warlike, as convinced him, that an encreaſe of force was requiſite to effect a ſettlement. Satisfied with having opened a communication with a new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, of whoſe value and importance he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieved very ſanguine hopes, he returned to Puerto Rico, through the channel now known by the name of the Gulf of Florida.</p>
               <p>Soon after the expedition to Florida, a diſcovery of much greater importance was made in another part of America, Balboa, having been raiſed to the government of the ſmall colony at Santa Maria in Darien, made frequent inroads into the adjacent
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025348_0070_0FCD009EF9853C28"/>country, and collected a conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of gold, which abounded more in that part of the continent than in the iſlands. In one of theſe excurſions, the Spaniards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch eagerneſs about the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome gold, that they were at the point of proceeding to acts of violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one another. A young Indian prince, who was preſent, aſtoniſhed at the high value they ſet upon a thing, of which he did not diſcern the uſe, tumbled the gold out of the balance with indignation, and, turning to the Spaniards, "Why do you quarrel," (ſaid he) "about ſuch a trifle? If you are to paſſionately fond of gold, as to abandon your own country, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the tranquility of diſtant nations for its ſake, I will conduct you to a region, where this metal, which ſeems to be the chief object of your admiration and deſire, is ſo common, that the meaneſt utenſils are formed of it."</p>
               <p>Balboa and his companions, tranſported with what they heard, eagerly enquired where this happy country lay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and how they might arrive at it. He informed them, at the diſtance of ſix ſuns, that is, of ſix days journey towards the South, they ſhould diſcover another ocean, near to which this wealthy kingdom was ſituated; but, if they intended to attack that powerful ſtate, they muſt aſſemble forces far ſuperior in number
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025348_0071_0FCD00A08A3FBFB0"/>and ſtrength to what they were at preſent. This was the firſt information which the Spaniards received concerning the ſouthern ocean, or the opulent and extenſive country known afterwards by the name of Peru.</p>
               <p>Balboa, having muſtered all the forces he could, which amounted only to 190 men, ſet out on this important expedition on the firſt of September, 1513, about the time that the periodical rains began to abate. Though their guides had repreſented the breadth of the iſtmus to be only a journey of ſix days, they had already ſpent twenty five in forcing their way through the woods and mountains. Many of them were ready to ſink under ſuch fatigue in that ſultry cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, ſeveral were ſeized with the diſeaſes peculiar to the country, and all became im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to reach the period of their labors and ſufferings. At length the indians aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that from the top of the next mountain they ſhould diſcover the ocean which was the object of their wiſhes. When with infinite toil they had climbed up the greater part of that ſteep aſcent, Balboa commanded his men to halt and advanced alone to the ſummit, that he might be the firſt who ſhould enjoy ſuch a ſpectacle which he had ſo long deſired. As ſoon as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the South Sea ſtretching in endleſs proſpect below him, he fell on his knees, and lifting up his hands to heaven, returned
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025348_0072_0FCD00A24BAD5D58"/>thanks to God, who had conducted him to a diſcovery, ſo beneficial to his country, and ſo honorable to himſelf. His followers, obſerving his tranſports of joy, ruſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to join his wonder, exultation and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. They held on their courſe to the ſhore, with great alacrity, when Balboa ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing up to the middle in the waves, with his buckler and ſword, took poſſeſſion of that ocean in the name of the king his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and vowed to defend it.</p>
               <p>That part of the great Pacific or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ocean, which Balboa firſt diſcovered, ſtill retains the name of the Gulf of St. Michael, which he gave to it, and is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the eaſt of Panama. From ſeveral of the petty princes, who governed in the diſtricts adjacent to that gulf, he extorted proviſions and gold by force of arms; others ſent them to him voluntarily. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the acquiſition of this wealth, which ſerved to ſoothe and encourage his followers, he received accounts which con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>firmed his ſanguine hopes of future and more extenſive benefits from this expedition. All the people on the coaſts of the South Sea concurred in informing him, that there was a mighty and opulent kingdom ſituated at a conſiderable diſtance towards the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt, where gold was found in plenty.</p>
               <p>Though the information Balboa received from the people, on the coaſt, as well as
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:025348_0073_0FCD00A38011DA50"/>his own conjectures and hopes, made him extremely impatient to viſit this unknown country, his prudence reſtrained him from attempting to invade it with a handful of men, exhauſted by fatigue, and weakened by diſeaſes. He determined to lead back his followers to their ſettlement at Santa Maria in Darien, and to return next ſeaſon with a force more adequate to ſuch an ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enterprize. He reached Santa Maria after an abſence of four months, with greater glory and more treaſure, than the Spaniards ever had acquired in any former expedition in the New World.</p>
               <p>He took care to acquaint the court of Spain with the important diſcovery he had made and demanded a reinforcment of a thouſand men, in order to attempt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of that opulent country, concerning which he had received ſuch inviting intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>The meanneſſes and jealouſies of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, and the advice of men around him worſe than himſelf, induced him to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede Balboa, the moſt proper man he could have employed, and to appoint Pedrarias Davila governor of Darien. He gave him the command of fourteen ſtout veſſels, and twelve hundred ſoldiers. Theſe were fitted out at the public expence, and granted with a liberality unuſual to Ferdinand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:025348_0074_0FCD00A5971A3AF8"/>
Perdrarias reached the gulf at Darien without any remarkable accident in July, 1514; but his ill conduct, and baſe treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Balboa, ſtopped all operations, and nearly ruined this flouriſhing colony. Both parties ſent home complaints to Spain againſt each other.</p>
               <p>At length, Ferdinand, became ſenſible of his imprudence in ſuperceeding the moſt active and experienced officer he had in the New World, and, by way of compenſation to Balboa, he appointed him lieutenant-governor of the countries upon the South Sea, with very extenſive privileges and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, at the ſame time ordering Pedra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias to ſupport him in all his operations, and to conſult him on every meaſure which he himſelf purſued. Surely nothing could be more ridiculous and abſurd in Ferdinand than this conduct! Pedrarias now conceived the moſt implacable hatred to Balboa, and, though he afterwards ſeemed ſo far 1 con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him, as to give him his daughter in marriage, he ſoon found means falſely to accuſe him of high <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reaſon, had him tried, condemned, and publicly executed in 1517. Pedrarias, notwithſtanding the violence and injuſtice of his proceedings, was not only ſcreened from puniſhment by the powerful patronage of the infamous biſhop of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos, an inveterate enemy to real merit, but continued in the government.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:025348_0075_0FCD00A740098968"/>
While matters were thus going forward in Darien, ſeveral important events occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with reſpect to the diſcovery, the conqueſt, and government of other provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the New World. Ferdinand was ſo intent upon opening a communication with the Molucca or Spice Iſlands by the weſt, that, in the year 1515, he fitted out two ſhips at his own expence, in order to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſuch a voyage, and gave the command of them to Juan Diaz de Solis, who was deemed one of the moſt ſkilful navigators in Spain. He ſtood along the coaſt of South America, and on the firſt of January. 1516, he entered a river which he called Janeiro, where an extenſive commerce is now carried on. From thence he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ſpacious bay which he ſuppoſed to be the entrance into a ſtrait that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated with the indian ocean; but upon advancing farther, he found it to be the mouth of Rio de Plata, one of the vaſt rivers by which the ſouthern continent of America is watered. In endeavoring to make a deſcent in this county, De Sollis and ſeveral of his crew were ſlain by the natives; who, in ſight of the ſhips, cut their bodies in pieces, roaſted and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Diſcouraged by the loſs of their commander and terrified at this horrid ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, the ſurviving Spaniards ſet ſail for Europe, without aiming at any further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025348_0076_0FCD00A8DA7FE3C8"/>Though this attempt proved abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive it was not without benefit: it turned the attention of ingenious men to this courſe of navigation, and prepared the way for a more fortunate voyage.</p>
               <p>While diſcoveries were thus going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Hiſpaniola continued as their principal colony, and the ſeat of government. Don Diego Columbus wanted neither inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or abilities to have rendered the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this colony, who were moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately under his direction, proſperous and happy; but he was circumſcribed in all his operations by the ſuſpicious policy of Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand, who on every occaſion, and under the moſt frivolous pretexts, retrenched his privileges, and encouraged the treaſurer, the judges, and other ſubordinate officers, to counteract his meaſures, and to diſpute his authority. In ſhort, Ferdinand's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was ſo ungenerous, as obliged Don Diego to quit Hiſpaniola, and repair to Spain, in order to ſeek redreſs for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries</p>
               <p>On the death of Ferdinand, in 1517, Charle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Diego Velaſquez, who conquered Cuba in the year 1511, ſtill retained the government of that iſland, as the deputy of Don Diego Columbus, though he ſeldom acknowledged his ſuperior, and aimed at rendering his own authority altogether inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:025348_0077_0FCD00AAB8C3AD60"/>Under his prudent adminiſtration, Cuba became one of the moſt flouriſhing of the Spaniſh ſettlements. The fame of this drew many perſons from the other colonies, expecting there to find ſome permanent eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment, or ſome employment for their activity As Cuba lay to the weſt of all the iſlands poſſeſſed by the Spaniards, and as the ocean which ſtretches beyond it tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards that quarter, had not hitherto been explored, theſe circumſtances-naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the inhabitants to attempt new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries.</p>
               <p>An expedition for this purpoſe in which activity and reſolution might conduct to ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wealth, was more ſuited to the genius of the age, than the patient induſtry requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in clearing ground, and manufacturing ſugar. Hence it happened, that ſeveral officers who had ſerved under Pedrarias in Darien, entered into an aſſociation to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake a voyage of diſcovery. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded Franciſco Hernandez Cordova an opulent planter in Cuba, and a man of great courage, to join with them in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and choſe him to be their comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

               <p>Three ſmall veſſels were purchaſed, and furniſhed with every thing requiſite either for traffic or war. An hundred and ten men embarked on board them, and ſailed
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025348_0078_0FCD00ABC104A690"/>from St. Jago de Cuba on the 8th of Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary, 1517.</p>
               <p>On the twenty-firſt day after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from St Jago, they ſaw land which proved to be Cape Catoche, the eaſtern point of that large peninſula projecting from the continent of America, which ſtill retains its original name of Yucatan. As they approached the ſhore, five canoes came off full of people decently clad in cotton garments: an aſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>ing ſight to the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards, who had found every other part of America poſſeſſed by native ſavages. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dova endeavored by ſmall preſents to gain the good will of theſe people. They, though amazed at the ſtrange objects now preſented for the firſt time to their view, invited the Spaniards to viſit their habitations, with an appearance of cordiality. They landed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and as they advanced into the country, they obſerved with new wonder ſome large houſes built with ſtone: but they ſoon found, if the Yucatans had made progreſs in improvement beyond their countrymen, they were likewiſe more artful and warlike. Though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian chief received Cordova with many tokens of friendſhip, he had poſted a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable body of his ſubjects in ambuſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a thicket, who upon a ſignal given by him, ruſhed out and attacked the Spaniards with great boldneſs, and with ſome degree of
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025348_0079_0FCD00ADD31FF348"/>martial order. At the firſt flight of their arrows, fifteen of the Spaniards were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but the indians were ſo terrified with the ſudden exploſion of the fire arms, and ſo ſurpriſed at the execution done by them, by the croſs bows, and by the other weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their new enemies, that they precip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itately fled. Cordova immediately quitted a country where he had met with ſo unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a reception, carrying off two priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with the ornaments of a ſmall temple which he plundered in making his retreat to his ſhip.</p>
               <p>Cordova continued his courſe towards the weſt without loſing ſight of the coaſt, and on the ſixteenth day arrived at Campeachy. At this place the natives received them more kindly; but the Spaniards were much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, that on all the extenſive coaſt along which they had ſailed, they had not met with any river. Their water beginning to fail, they advanced in hope of finding a ſupply; and at length they diſcovered the mooth of a river.</p>
               <p>Cordova landed all his troops in order to protect the ſailors, whoſe buſineſs it was to fill the caſks; but the natives ruſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with ſuch fury, and in ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that forty-ſeven of the Spaniards were killed upon the ſpot, and one man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the whole body eſcaped unhurt.— Their commander though wounded in
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025348_0080_0FCD00AF36FE1C18"/>twelve different places, directed the retreat with preſence of mind equal to the courage with which he had led them on in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and with much difficulty they reached their ſhips. Having met with this terrible repulſe, nothing remained but to haſten back to Cuba with their ſhattered forces. In their paſſage thither, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the greateſt diſtreſs from the want of water, that men wounded and ſickly, ſhut up in ſmall veſſels, and expoſed to the heat of the torrid zone, can be ſuppoſed to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. Some died on their paſſage and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dova their commander, ſoon after he landed at Cuba paid the debt of nature.</p>

They had diſcovered an extenſive country, ſituated in the neighborhood of Cuba, fertile in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and poſſeſſed by a people far more refined than any they had hitherto met with in America. Velaſquez, through particular views of ambition and intereſt, not only encouraged their ardor, but at his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe futed out four ſhips for the voyage. Two hundred and forty volunteers, among whom were ſeveral perſons of rank and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, embarked in this enterpriſe. The command of it was given to Juan de Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jalva a young man of known merit and courage, with inſtructions attentively to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025348_0081_0FCD00B0411D9178"/>the nature of the countries which he ſhould diſcover; to barter for gold; and, if circumſtances were inviting, to ſettle a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony in ſome proper ſtation. He ſailed from St Jago de Cuba, on the 8th of April, 1518.</p>
               <p>They held the ſame courſe as in the former voyage, and at laſt reached Poton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan, where the laſt adventurers had been ſo roughly handled. The deſire of avenging their countrymen who had been ſlain there, concurred with their ideas of good policy, in prompting them to land, that they might chaſtize the Indians with ſuch exemplary rigour, as would ſtrike terror into all the people round them; but, though they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imbarked all their troops and carried aſhore ſome field pieces, the Indians fought with ſuch courage, that the Spaniards with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty gained the victory: and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in their opinion, that the inhabitants of this country would prove more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enemies than any they had met with in other parts of America.</p>
               <p>From Potonchan, they continued their voyage <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

During the day their eyes were turned continually to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards land, with a mixture of ſurprize and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:025348_0082_0FCCDB8F8DB3C830"/>wonder at the beauty of the country, as well as the novelty of the objects they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. Many villages were ſcattered along the coaſt, in which they could diſtinguiſh houſes of ſtone that appeared white and lofty at a diſtance, One of the ſoldiers happening to remark, that this country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled Spain in its appearance. Grijalva, with univerſal applauſe, called it New Spain, the name which ſtill diſtinguiſhes this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and opulent province of Spaniſh empire in America.</p>
               <p>On the 9th of June, they landed in a river, which the natives called Tabaſco, and the fame of their victory at Potonchan having reached this place, the chief not only received them amicably, but beſtowed preſents upon them of ſuch value, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the higheſt ideas, which the Spaniards had formed, with reſpect to the wealth and fertility of the country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe ideas were raiſed ſtill higher, by what occurred at the place where they next touched. This was conſiderably to the weſt of Tabaſco, in the province ſince known by the name of Guaxaca. There they were received with the reſpect due to ſuperior beings. The people perfumed them as they landed with gum copal, and preſented to them as offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the choiceff delicacies of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They were extremely fond of trading with their new viſitants, and in ſix days
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:025348_0083_0FCD00B3A50B17E0"/>he Spaniards obtained ornaments of gold, of curious workmanſhip, to the value of fifteen thouſand peſos, in exchange for European toys of ſmall price. The two priſoners, whom Cordavo had brought from Yucatan, had hitherto ſerved as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters: but as they were unacquainted with the language of this country, the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards learned from the natives by ſigns, that they were the ſubjects of a great mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, called Montezuma, whoſe dominions extended over that and many other provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>Leaving this province, with which he had ſo much reaſon to be contented, Grijalva continued his courſe towards the weſt. He landed on a ſmall iſland, which he named the Iſle of Sacrifices, becauſe there the Spaniards beheld the horrid ſpectacle of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man victims, which the barbarous ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the natives offered to their gods. He touched at another ſmall iſland, which he called St. Juan de Ulua.</p>
               <p>From this place he diſpatched Predo de Alverado, one of his officers, to Velaſquez, with a full account of the important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries he had made, and with all the treaſure that he had acquired by trafficking with the natives. After the departure of Alverado, he himſelf, with the remaining veſſels, proceeded along the coaſt as far as the river Panuco, the country ſtill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:025348_0084_0FCD00B4C05868D0"/>to be well peopled, fertile and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulent.</p>
               <p>It was the opinion of ſeveral of Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jalva's officers, that it was not enough to have diſcovered thoſe delightful regions, or to have performed, at their different landing-places, the empty ceremony of taking poſſeſſion of them for the crown of Caſtile, and that their glory was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, unleſs they planted a colony in ſome proper ſtation which might not only ſecure the Spaniſh nation a footing in the country; but with the reinforcements they were certain of receiving, might gradually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the whole to the dominion of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. However, the ſquadron had now been above ſix months at ſea, the greate part of their proviſions were exhauſted, and what remained of their ſtores ſo much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the heat of the climate, as to be almoſt unfit for uſe; they had loſt ſome men by death, and others were ſickly; the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was crouded with people, who ſeemed to be intelligent as well as brave, and they were under the government of one power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful monarch, who could bring them to act againſt their invaders with united force. To plant a colony under ſo many correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficulties, appeared a matter too hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous to be attempted. Though Grijalva was not without ambition and courage, yet he was deſtitute of the ſuperior abilities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025348_0085_0FCD00B6D0E1EE10"/>to form and execute ſo extenſive a plan. He judged it more prudent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Cuba, having fulfilled the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of his voyage, and accompliſhed every thing, which the armament he commanded enabled him to perform. He returned to St. Jago de Cuba, on the 26th of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, from whence he had ſailed about ſix months, without having met with any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial accident.</p>
               <p>As this was the longeſt, ſo it had been the moſt ſucceſsful voyage the Spaniards had hitherto made in the new world. They had diſcovered that Yucatan was not an iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and as they had ſuppoſed, but part of the great continent of America. From Poton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan they had purſued their courſe for many hundred miles along a coaſt formerly unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored, ſtretching at firſt towards the weſt and then turning to the north. All the country they diſcovered appeared to be no leſs valuable than extenſive. As ſoon as Avarado reached Cuba, Velaſquez, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with ſucceſs ſo far beyond his moſt ſanguine expectations, immediately diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a perſon of confidence to carry this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant intelligence to Spain; to exhibit the rich productions of the countries which had been diſcovered by his means; and to ſolicit ſuch an increaſe of authority, as might enable and encourage him to attempt the conqueſt of them. Without waiting
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025348_0086_0FCD00B94CBE9E78"/>for the return of his meſſenger, or for the arrival of Grijalva, of whom he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo jealous or diſtruſtful that he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no longer to employ him, he began to prepare ſuch a powerful armament, as might prove equal to an enterpriſe of ſo much danger and importance. The little and mean jealouſies, which the Spaniards ſeem naturally to entertain of every man of merit, is a very ſingular blemiſh in the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of that nation.</p>
               <p>The expedition for which Velaſquez was now preparing with ſo much ardour and activity, had in its views conqueſts far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the Spaniſh nation had hitherto accompliſhed. It led them to the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of a people, who, if compared with thoſe tribes of South America, and the Weſt Indies, with whom they were hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acquainted, were infinitely more civilized, and far better acquainted with the arts of war and the ſciences in general. Before we proceed to the hiſtory of events extreme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly different from thoſe we have already related, it may not be improper to take a view of the ſtate of the New World, ſuch as it was when firſt diſcovered, and to contemplate the policies and manners of the rude uncultivated tribes, by whom the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of it were occupied, and with whom the Spaniards at this time had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. This ſhall be the ſubject of our next chapter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IV.</head>
               <p>THE immenſe extent of the New World is a circumſtance that ſtrikes us with wonder. America is remarkable, not only for its magnitude, but for its poſition. It ſtretches from the northern polar circle to a high ſouthern latitude, above fifteen hundred miles beyond the furtheſt extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the old continent on that ſide of the line. Next to its extent, the grandeur of the objects which it preſents to our view is moſt apt to ſtrike the eye of an obſerver. Nature ſeems to have carried on her opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon a larger ſcale, with a bolder hand, and to have diſtinguiſhed the features of this country by a peculiar magnificence. The mountains of America are much ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior in height to thoſe in the other diviſions of the globe. Even the plain of Quito, which may be conſidered as the baſe of the Andes, is elevated farther above the ſea, than the top of the Pyrenees. From thoſe lofty mountains deſcend rivers proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably large, with which the ſtreams in the ancient continent are not to be compared, either for length of courſe, or the vaſt body of water, which they roll towards the ocean. Their lakes are no leſs conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for grandeur than their mountains and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025348_0089_0FCD00BE057D3E30"/>rivers. They may be properly termed is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſeas of freſh water.</p>
               <p>The temperature of the climate of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, and the different laws to which it is ſubject with reſpect to the diſtribution of heat and cold, are marks which particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh it from other parts of the earth. Throughout all theſe vaſt regions, there were only two monarchies remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for extent of territory, or diſtinguiſhed by any progreſs in improvement. The reſt of their continent was poſſeſſed by ſmall independent tribes, deſtitute of arts and induſtry, and neither capable to correct the defects, nor deſirous to meliorate the condition of that part of the earth allotted to them for their habitation. Countries, occupied by ſuch people, were almoſt in the ſame ſtate as if they had been without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the vaſt extent of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, and the variety of its climates, the different ſpecies of animals peculiar to it are much fewer in proportion, than thoſe of the other hemiſphere. In the iſlands, there are only four kinds of quadrupeds known, the largeſt of which did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the ſize of a rabbit. On the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, the variety was greater; and though the individuals of each kind could not fail of multiplying exceedingly, when almoſt unmoleſted by men, who were neither ſo
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025348_0090_0FCD00BF49FAE6B0"/>numerous, nor ſo united in ſociety, as to be formidable enemies to the animal crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet the number of diſtinct ſpecies muſt be conſidered as extremely ſmall.</p>
               <p>To the cauſes, which checked the growth and vigour of the more noble animals, may be attributed the propagation and increaſe of reptiles and infects. The air is often darkened with clouds of inſects, and the ground covered with ſhocking and noxious reptiles.</p>
               <p>The American birds of the torrid zone, like thoſe of the ſame climate in Aſia and Africa, are decked in plumage, which dazzles the eye with the beauty of its col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours; but nature, ſatisfied with clothing them in this gay dreſs, has denied moſt of them that melody of ſound, and variety of notes, which catch and delight the ear. Let my youthful readers ſtop here, and pauſe for a while; through all the conditions and circumſtances of life, they will find, on reflection, that the hand of Providence has diſtributed things more equally than they are aware of, as well in the human, as in the feathered race.</p>
               <p>In a continent ſo extenſive as America, the nature of the ſoil muſt be various. In each of its provinces, we find ſome diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing peculiarity, the deſcription of which belongs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hoſe who write their particular
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025348_0091_0FCD00C176E3B648"/>hiſtory, and would be an idle attempt to deſcribe in this epitome.</p>
               <p>How America was firſt peopled, by what courſe mankind migrated from one continent to the other, and in what quarter it is moſt probable the communication was firſt opened between them, are matters for which we have little grounds to go upon beyond that of conjecture. The theories and ſpeculations of ingenious men, with reſpect to this ſubject, would fill many volumns; but they are often ſo wild and chimerical, that it would be offering an inſult to the underſtanding of our readers, to attempt either to enumerate or refute them, even provided the limits of this work would admit of it.</p>
               <p>To enquire into the character and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the American nations, at the time when they became known to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, deſerves more attentive conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than the enquiry concerning their original. The diſcovery of the New World enlarged the ſphere of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and preſented nations to our view in a ſtate very rude and uncultivated.. The greater part of the inhabitants were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to induſtry and labor, ignorant of arts, imperfectly acquainted with the nature of property, and enjoying almoſt without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction or controul the bleſſings which flowed ſpontaneouſly from the bounty of
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025348_0092_0FCD00C24D54B840"/>nature. Among the ſmall independent tribes of South America, their cuſtoms, manners and inſtitututions, were nearly ſimilar, and ſo extremely rude, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of <hi>ſavages</hi> may be applied to them all. The Spaniards who firſt viſited America, and who had opportunity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding its various tribes, while entire and unſubdued, were far from poſſeſſing the qualities requiſite for obſerving the ſtriking ſpectable preſented to their view. Neither the age in which they lived, nor the nation to which they belonged, had made ſuch progreſs in true ſcience, as inſpires enlarged and liberal ſentiments. The conquerors of the New World were moſtly illiterate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers, deſtitute of all the ideas which ſhould have directed them in contemplating objects, ſo extremely different from thoſe with which they were acquainted. Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded continually with danger, or ſtruggling with hardſhips, they had little leiſure, and leſs capacity, for any ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive enquiry. Eager to take poſſeſſion of a country of ſuch extent and opulence, and happy in finding it occupied by inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants ſo incapable to defend it, they haſtily pronounced them to be a wretched order of men, formed merely for ſervitude; and were more employed in computing the profits of their labour, than in enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the operations of their minds,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025348_0093_0FCD00C3C2D73BE0"/>or the reaſon of their cuſtoms and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The human body is leſs affected by climate than that of any other animal. Some ani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mals are confined to a particular region of the globe, and cannot exiſt beyond it; while others though they may be brought to bear the injuries of a foreign climate, ceaſe to multiply when carried from their native air and ſoil. Even ſuch as ſeem ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being naturalized in various cli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mates, feel the effect of every remove from their proper ſtation, and gradually dwindle and degenerate from the vigor and perfection peculiar to their ſpecies. Man is the only living creature, whoſe frame is at once ſo hardy and ſo flexible, that he can ſpread over the whole earth, become the inhabitant of every region, and thrive and multiply under every climate, though not without ſome attending inconven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iences.</p>
               <p>The complexion of the Americans is of a reddiſh brown, nearly reſembling the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of copper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Their perſons are of a full ſize, extremely ſtrait, and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but they are more remarkable for agility than ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>As the external form of the Americans leads us to ſuſpect that there is ſome natural debility in their frame, the ſmallneſs of their appetite for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>d has been mentioned by many authors
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:025348_0094_0FCD00C5464D8298"/>as a confirmation of this ſuſpicion. The quantity of food which men conſume varies according to the temperature of the climate in which they live, the degree of activity which they exert, and the natural vigor of their conſtitutions. Under the enervating heat of the torrid zone, and where men paſs their days in indolence and eaſe, they require leſs nouriſhment than the active inhabitants of temperate or cold countries.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the feeble make of the Americans, hardly any of them are defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, mutilated, or defective in any of their ſenſes. All travellers have been ſtruck with this circumſtance, and have celebrated the uniform ſymmetry and perfection of their external figure.</p>
               <p>In the ſimplicity of the ſavage ſtate, when man is not oppreſſed with labour, or ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by luxury, or diſquieted with care, we are apt to imagine that his life will flow on almoſt untroubled by diſeaſe or ſuffering, until his days be terminated in extreme old age, by the gradual decays of nature. We find, accordingly, among the Americans, as well as among other rude people, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whoſe decrepid and ſhrivelled forms ſeem to indicate on extraordinary length of life; but as moſt of them are unacquainted with the art of numbering, and all of them as forgetful of what is paſt, as they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provident for what is to come, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:025348_0095_0FCD00C8DA4140A0"/>to aſcertain their age with any degree of preciſion.</p>
               <p>Whatever may be the ſituation in which man is placed he is born to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uffer; and his diſeaſes in the ſavage ſtate, though fewer in number, are, like thoſe of the animals whom he nearly reſembles in his mode of life, more violent and more fatal. If lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury engenders and nouriſhes diſtempers of one ſpecies, the rigour and diſtreſs of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age life brings on thoſe of another. As men in this ſtate are wonderfully improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and their means of ſubſiſtence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, they often paſs from extreme want to exuberant plenty, according to the viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of fortune in the chaſe, or in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the various degree of abundance, with which the earth affords to them its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions in different ſeaſons Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate glu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tony in the one ſituation, and their ſevere abſtinence in the other, are equally pernicious. The ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of ſavages are at ſome ſeaſons, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by what they ſuffer from ſcarcity of food; at others, they are afflicted with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders ariſing from indigeſtions and a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of groſs aliment. Theſe are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that they may be conſidered as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable conſequence of their mode of ſubſiſting, and cut off conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the prime of life. There are other diſorders, to which they are continually
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025348_0096_0FCD00C9D4DA0EF8"/>expoſed, owing to the inclemency of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſeaſons. In the ſavage ſtate hardſhips and fatigues violently aſſault the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in poliſhed ſocieties, intemperance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermines it. It is not eaſy to determine which of them operates with moſt fatal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or tends moſt to abridge human life.</p>
               <p>The thoughts and attention of a ſavage are confined within the ſmall circle of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, immediately conducive to his preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or enjoyment. Every thing beyond that is beneath his obſervations, or is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely indifferent to him. Like a mere ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, what is before his eyes intereſts and affects him; what is out of ſight or at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. makes little impreſſion. They fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low blindly the impulſe of the appetite they feel, but are entirely regardleſs of diſtant conſequences, and even of thoſe remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the leaſt degree from immediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
               <p>The active efforts of their minds are few and languid. The deſires of ſimple nature are very limited, and where a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able climate yields almoſt ſpontaneouſly what ſuffices to gratify them, they ſcarcely ſtir the ſoul, or excite any violent emotion. Hence the people of ſeveral tribes in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica waſte their lives in a ſtate of indolence.</p>
               <p>To be free from occupation, ſeems to be all the enjoyment to which they aſpire. Such is their averſion to labour, that neith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025348_0097_0FCD00CB43584ED8"/>the hope of future good, nor the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of evil, can ſurmount it. They appear equally indifferent to both, diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering little ſolicitude, and taking no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution to avoid the one, or to ſecure the other. The cravings of hunger may rouſe them: but as they devour with little diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whatever will appeaſe its inſtinctive demands, the exertions theſe occaſion are of ſhort duration.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the rudeſt tribes in America, a regular union between huſband and wife was univerſal, and the rights of marriage were underſtood and recognized. In thoſe diſtricts where ſubſiſtence was ſcanty, and the difficulty of maintaining a family was great the man confined himſelf to one wife. In warmer and more fertile provinces, the facility of procuring food concurred with the influence of climate, in inducing the inhabitants to encreaſe the number of their wives. In ſome countries, the marriage union ſubſiſted during life; in others, the impatience of the Americans under reſtraint of any ſpecies, together with their natural levity and caprice, prompted them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it on very ſlight pretexts, and often without aſſigning any cauſe.</p>
               <p>The ſituation of the American women, in whatever light we conſider them, was equally humiliating and mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erable. Among many people of America the marriage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025348_0098_0FCD00CDED28A758"/>is properly a purchaſe. The man buys his wife of her parents. Though unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the uſe of money, or with ſuch commerical tranſactions as take place in more improved ſociety, he knows how to give an equivalent for an object he deſires to poſſeſs. In ſome places, the ſuitor devotes his ſervice for a certain time to the parent of the maid whom he courts; in others, he hunts for them occaſionally, or aſſiſts in cultivating their fields, and forming their canoes; in others, he offers preſents of ſuch things as are deemed moſt valuable on account of their uſefulneſs or rarity. In return for theſe, he receives his wife; and this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, added to the low eſtimation of women among ſavages, leads him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider her a female ſervant whom he has a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to treat as an inferior. The condition of an American woman is ſo peculiarly grievous, and their depreſſion ſo complete, that ſervitude is a name too mild to deſcribe their wretched ſtate. A wife, among moſt tribes, is no better than a beaſt of burden, deſtined to every office of labour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue. While the men loiter out the day in ſloth, or ſpend it in amuſement, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are condemned to inceſſant toil. Taſks are impoſed upon them without pity, and ſervices are received without complacence or grat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>de. Every circumſtance reminds
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025348_0099_0FCD013A36000920"/>women of this mortifying inferiority. They muſt approach their lords with reverence, regard them as more exalted beings, and are not permited to eat in their preſence.</p>
               <p>The Americans are not deficient in affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and attachment to their offspring. They feel the power of this inſtinct in its full force, and as long as their progeny continue feeble and helpleſs no people exceed them in tenderneſs and care. In the ſimplicity of the ſavage ſtate the affections of parents, like the inſtinctive fondneſs of animals. ceaſes almoſt entirely as ſoon as their offspring at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain maturity. Little inſtruction fits them for that mode of life to which they are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>. The parents, as if their duty were accompliſhed, when they have conducted their children through the helpleſs years of infancy, leave them afterwards at entire liberty. In an American but, a father, a mother, and their poſterity, live together like perſons aſſembled by accident, without ſeeming to feel the obligation of the duties mutually ariſing from ſuch connection.</p>
               <p>Though the people of America may be all comprehendedr unde the general denom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination of ſavage, the advances they had made in the art of procuring to themſelves a certain and plentiful ſubſiſtence were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unequal.

None but tribes contigious to great rivers can ſupport themſelves in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The greater part of the American nations, diſperſed over the foreſts with which their country is covered, do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſubſiſtence with the ſame facility; but are obliged to obtain it by hunting, which in many parts is their principal occupation, and which requires ſtrenuous exertions.</p>
               <p>As game and fiſh are the principal food of the Americans, their agriculture is neither extenſive nor laborious. Their principal productions in this line are maze, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oc,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025348_0101_0FCCDBA18C012E60"/>plaintain, potatoes, and pimento. All the fruits of their induſtry, together with what their ſoil and climate produced ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly, afforded them but a ſcanty main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Though their demands for food were very ſparing, they hardly raiſed what was ſufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tor their own conſumption.</p>
               <p>In America, the word nation is not of the ſame import as in other parts of the globe. It is applied to ſmall ſocieties, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not exceeding two or three hundred perſons, but occupying provinces larger than ſome kingdoms in Europe. In the provinces which border on the Oronoco, one may travel ſeveral hundred miles, in different directions, without finding a ſingle hut or obſerving the footſteps of a human creature.</p>
               <p>The Americans had no idea of property. As the animals on which the hunter feeds are not bred under his inſpection, nor nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by his care, he can claim no right to them while they run wild in the foreſt. The foreſts, or hunting grounds, are deemed the property of the tribe, from which it has a title to exclude every rival nation; but no individual arrogates a right to any diſtrict of theſe, in preference to his fellow-citizen.</p>
               <p>We ſhall now proceed to take a curſory view of their art of war. Savage nations, in carrying on their public wars, are influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the ſame ideas, and animated with
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:025348_0102_0FCCDBA3B8FBEFB8"/>the ſame ſpirit, as in proſecuting private vengeance. The maxims by which they regulate their military operations, though extremely different from thoſe, which take place among more civilized and populous nations, are well ſuited to their own polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical ſtate, and the nature of the country in which they act. They never take the field in numerous bodies, as it would require a greater effort of foreſight and induſtry, than is uſual among ſavages, to provide for their ſubſiſtence, during a march of ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles through dreary foreſts, or during a long voyage upon their lakes and rivers.</p>
               <p>Their armies are not encumbered with baggage or military ſtores. Each warrior, beſides his arms, carries a mat and a ſmall bag of pounded maize, and with theſe he is completely equipped for any ſervice. While at a diſtance from the enemies frontier, they diſperſe through the woods, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>port themſelves with the game they kill, and the fiſh they catch.

In the warmer and more mild climates of America, none of the rude tribes were cloathed. To moſt of them Nature had not even ſuggeſted any Idea of impropriety of being altogether uncovered. As under a mild climate there was little need of any defence from the injuries of the air, and their extreme indolence ſhunned every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of labour to which it was not urged by abſolute neceſſity, all the inhabitants of the iſles, and a conſiderable part of the people on the continent, remained in this ſtate of naked ſimplicity. Others were ſatisfied with ſome ſlight covering, ſuch as decency required; but though naked, they were not unadorned. They faſtned bits of gold or ſhells, or ſhining ſtones, to their ears, their noſes, and cheeks. They ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſkins with a great variety of figures, and they ſpent much time, and ſubmitted to great pain, in ornamenting their perſons in this fantaſtic manner.</p>
               <p>In one part of their dreſs, which, at firſt ſight appears the moſt ſingular and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious, the Americans have diſcovered conſiderable ſagacity in providing againſt the chief inconveniences of their climate, which is often ſultry, and moiſt to exceſs. All the different tribes, which remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed, are accuſtomed to anoint and rub their bodies with the greaſe of animals, with viſcous gums, and with oils of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025348_0104_0FCD00D1FA50A278"/>kinds. By this they check that profuſe perſpiration, which in the torrid zone, waſtes the vigour of the frame, and abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the period of human life. By this too they provide a defence againſt the extreme moiſture during the rainy ſeaſon. They likewiſe, at certain ſeaſons, emper paint of different colours with thoſe unctious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and bedaub themſelves plentifully with that compoſition.</p>
               <p>Sheathed with this impenetrable varniſh their ſkins are not only protected from the heat of the ſun, but as all the innumerable tribes of infects have an antipathy to the ſmell or taſte of that mixture, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from their teazing perſecution, which amidſt foreſts and marſhes, eſpecially in the warmer regions, would have been wholly inſupportable in a ſtate of perfect naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Savage nations, being far from that ſtate of improvement, in which the mode of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is conſidered as a mark of diſtinction, and unacquainted with thoſe wants, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a variety of accommodations, regulate the conſtruction of their houſes according to their limited ideas of neceſſity. Some of the American tribes were ſo extremely rude and had advanced ſo little beyond the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meval ſimplicity of nature, that they had no houſes at all. During the day, they took ſhelter from the ſcorching rays of the ſun
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:025348_0105_0FCD00D3D56E4460"/>under thick trees, and at night they formed a ſhed with their branches and leaves. In the rainy ſeaſons they retired into caves, formed by the hand of nature or hallowed out by their own induſtry. Others, who had no fixed abode, and roamed through the foreſt in queſt of game, ſojourned in temporary huts, which they erected with little labour, and abandoned without any concern.</p>
               <p>Clubs made of heavy wood, ſtakes hard ened in the fire, lances whoſe heads were armed with flint or the bone of ſome animal are weapons known to the rudeſt nations. All theſe, however, were of uſe only in cloſe encounter; but men wiſhed to annoy their enemies while at a diſtance, and the bow and arrow is the moſt early invention for this purpoſe. The people in ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Chili, and thoſe of Patagonia, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſouthern extremity of America, uſe a weapon peculiar to themſelves. They faſten ſtones about the ſize of a man's fiſt to each end of a leather thong of eight feet in length, and ſwinging theſe round their heads, throw them with ſuch dexterity that they ſeldom miſs the object they aim at.</p>
               <p>As their food and habitations are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſimple, their domeſtic utenſils are few and rude. Some of the ſouthern tribes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the art of forming veſſels of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ware, and baking them in the ſun ſo as
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:025348_0106_0FCD00D50EB85F20"/>they could endure the fire. Theſe veſſels they uſed in preparing part of their proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this may be conſidered as a ſtep toward refinement and luxury; for men in their rudeſt ſtate were not acquainted with any method of dreſſing their victuals, but by roaſting them on the fire, and among ſeveral tribes in America, this is the only ſpecies of cookery yet known.</p>
               <p>What appears to be the maſter-piece of art among the ſavages of America is the conſtruction of their canoes. An Indian, ſhut up in his boat of whalebone, covered with ſkins, can brave that ſtormy ocean, on which he is compelled to depend for part of his ſubſiſtence. The inhabitants of the iſles in South America form their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes by hallowing the trunk of a large tree, with infinite labor, and though in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they are extremely awkward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy, they paddle and ſteer them with ſuch dexterity, that Europeans, well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the improvements in the ſcience of navigation, have been aſtoniſhed at the rapidity of their motion, and the quickneſs of their evolutions.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to their religion, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe tribes, whoſe religious ſyſtem was more enlarged, and who had formed ſome conception of benevolent beings, which delighted in conferring benefits, as well as of malicious powers prone to inflict
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025348_0107_0FCD00D6AAF28D78"/>evil, ſuperſtition ſtill appears as the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of fear, and all its efforts were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to avert calamities. They were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that their good deities, prompted by the benificence of their nature, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow every bleſſing in their power, without ſolicitation or acknowledgement; and their only anxiety was to ſooth and deprecate the wrath of the powers, whom they regarded as the enemies of mankind.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the immortality of the ſoul the ſentiments of the Americans were more united. The human mind, even when leaſt improved and invigorated by culture, ſhrinks from the thoughts of diſſolution, and looks forward with hope and expectation to a ſtate of future exiſtence. The moſt uncivilized ſavages of America do not apprehend death as the extinction of being: all entertain hopes of a future and more happy ſtate, where they ſhall be for ever exempt from the calamities, which em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter human life in its preſent condition. This future ſtate they conceive to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful country bleſt with perpetual ſpring, whoſe foreſts abound with game, whoſe riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſwarm with fiſh, where famine is never felt, and uninterrupted plenty ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed without labor or toil.</p>
               <p>As the diſeaſes of men in the ſavage ſtate are like thoſe of the animal creation, few but extremely violent, their impatience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025348_0108_0FCD00D8DC446788"/>what they ſuffer, and ſolicitude for the recovery of health, ſoon inſpired them with extraordinary reverence for ſuch as preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to underſtand the nature of their mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adies, or to preſerve them from their ſudden and fatal effects. However theſe ignorant pretenders being ſuch utter ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the ſtructure of the human frame, as to know neither the cauſes of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor the manner in which they were likely to terminate, ſuperſtition, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mingled with ſome portion of craft, ſupplied what they wanted in knowledge. They imputed the origin of diſeaſes to ſupernatural influence, and adviſed or performed a variety of ſuperſtitious rites, which they repreſented to be ſufficient to remove the moſt obſtinate and dangerous diſorders.</p>
               <p>From the ſuperſtition and credulity of the Americans likewiſe proceeded their faith in dreams, their obſervation of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> mens, their attention to the chirping of birds, and the cries of animals, all which they ſuppoſed to be indications of future events; and if any one of their prognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics was deemed unfavorable, they eagerly abandoned the object they had in purſuit.</p>
               <p>Savage as the Americans were, they were not without their amuſements; and of theſe dancing appears to be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025348_0109_0FCD00DA42B04738"/>The war dance ſeems to be the moſt ſtriking, in which are repreſented all the manoeuvres of an American campaign. Their ſongs and dances are moſtly ſolemn, and martial, they are connected with ſome of the moſt ſerious and important affairs of life, and, having no relation to love or gallantry, are ſeldom common to the two ſexes, but executed by the men and women apart.</p>
               <p>The Americans are univerſally fond of gaming. Though they are at other times ſo indifferent, phlegmatic, ſilent, and animated with ſo few deſires, as ſoon as they engage in play, they become rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, impatient, noiſy, and almoſt frantic with eagerneſs. Their furs, their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic utenſils, their clothes, their arms, are ſtaked at play and when all is loſt, high as their ſenſe of independence is, in a wild emotion of hope or deſpair, they will often riſk their perſonal liberty upon a ſingle bet. Among ſeveral tribes, ſuch gaming parties are frequently made, and become their moſt agreeable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at every great feſtival.</p>
               <p>The ſame cauſes that contribute to render them fond of play, is the cauſe of drunkenneſs among them. It ſeems to have been one of the firſt exertions of the human ingenuity to diſcover ſome <gap reason="missing" extent="1 page">

The moſt barbarous of the American tribes have been ſo unfortunate as to attain this art; and even thoſe which are deficient in knowledge as not to be acquainted with the method of giving an inebriating ſtrength to liquors by fermentation, can accompliſh the ſame by ſome other means.</p>
               <p>It is cuſtomary with the American Indians, when their parents and other relations become old, or labour under any diſtemper which the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> have not art enough to cure, to put an end to their lives, in order to be relieved from the burden of tending and ſupporting them. The ſame hardſhips and difficulty of procuring ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, which prevent ſavages, in ſome caſes, from rearing their children, prompt them to deſtroy the aged and infirm. The declining ſtate of the one is as help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as the infancy of the other; and the American thinks he does nothing more than his duty, in eaſing his father or friend of a burthenſome life of pain and diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>A hardneſs of heart and inſenſibility of feeling are remarkable in all ſavage nations. Their minds, rouſed only by ſtrong emotions, are little ſuſceptible of
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025348_0111_0FCD00DE0E75C840"/>gentle, delicate, or tender affections. When any favor is done him, he neither feels gratitude, nor thinks of making any return. The high idea of independence among the Americans nouriſhes a ſullen reſerve, which keeps them at a diſtance from each other.</p>
               <p>A ſavage, frequently placed in ſituations of danger or diſtreſs, depending on no one but himſelf, and wrapped up in his own thoughts and ſchemes, is a ſerious and melancholy animal. The American, when not engaged in action, often ſits whole days in one poſture, without opening his lips. When they engage in war or the chace, they uſually march in a line at ſome diſtance from each other, and do not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change a ſingle word. Even in their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes, the ſame profound ſilence is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and nothing but intoxicating liquors or jolity attending their dances, can at any rate render them in the leaſt converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>We may attribute the refined cunning, with which they form and execute their ſchemes, to the ſame cauſes. With the American Indians, war is a ſyſtem of craft, in which they truſt for ſucceſs to ſtratagem more than to open force, and have their invention continually at work to cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>However, let us not ſuppoſe that the Americans were without their virtues, among which fortitude and courage were remarkably conſpicious.

They are naturally attached to the community of which they are members. From the nature of their political union, we ſhould be led to ſuppoſe this tie to be very feeble; but each individual freely and cheerfully undertakes the moſt perilous ſervice, when the community deems it neceſſary.

               <p>Though the governor had laid out conſiderable ſums, and each adventurer had exhauſted his ſtock, or ſtrained his credit, the poverty of the preparation was ſuch, as muſt aſtoniſh the preſent age, and bore no reſemblance to an armament deſtined for the conqueſt of a great empire. The fleet conſiſted of eleven veſſels, the largeſt of one hundred tons, which was dignified with the name of Admiral; three of ſeventy or eighty tons and the reſt ſmall open barks. On board of theſe were 617 men; of which 508 belonged to the land ſervice, and 109 were ſeamen or artificers. As the uſe of fire-arms among the nations of Europe was hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a few battallions of regular diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined infantry, only thirteen ſoldiers were armed with muſkets; thirty-two were croſs-bow men, and the reſt had ſwords and ſpears.

Next morning, without waiting for any anſwer, he landed his troops, his horſes, and artillery; and having choſen proper ground, began to erect huts for his men, and fortify his camp.</p>
               <p>The Mexicans treated the Spaniards with the greateſt civility, but wiſhed to divert them from their intention of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the capital, where the emperor Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma reſided. For this purpoſe, they commenced a negociation, by introducing a train of a hundred Indians loaded with preſents, ſent from Montezuma to Cortes. The magnificence of theſe were ſuch as became a great monarch, and far exceeded any idea the Spaniards had hitherto formed of his wealth. They were placed upon mats ſpread on the ground, in ſuch order as ſhewed them to the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Cortes and his officers viewed
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:025348_0117_0FCD00E7C260D748"/>with admiration the various manufactures of the country; cotton ſtuffs ſo fine, and of ſuch delicate texture, as to reſemble ſilks; pictures of animals, trees and other natural objects, formed with feathers of different colours, diſpoſed and mingled with ſuch ſkill and elegance, as to rival the works of the pencil in truth and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of imitation, but what more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly attracted the attention of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards, was the amazing quantity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought gold and ſilver, and the profuſion of pearls and pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe rich preſents, inſtead of inducing the Spaniards to quit Mexico, made them the more reſolute to make a conqueſt of it. Cortes inſiſted on viſiting the king in his capital and declared he would not leave the iſland till that was granted. Of all the princes who had ſwayed the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſceptre. Montezuma was the moſt haughty, violent, and impatient of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. His ſubjects viewed him with awe, and his enemies with terror. The former he governed with unrelenting rigour, and the latter he reduced to awe by the power of his arms. However though his power and tyranny kept his ſubjects and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in awe, yet he wanted thoſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

               <p>Montezuma from the moment the Spaniards appeared on the coaſt, diſcovered ſymptoms of timidity and embarraſſment, Inſtead of taking ſuch reſolutions as his power enabled him, he deliberated with an anxiety and heſſitation that did not eſcape the notice of the meaneſt of his courtiers. He ſpent his time in fruitleſs negociations with the Spaniards, and thereby raiſed their courage and conſequence.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Cortes was watching the opportunity to throw off all connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Velaſquez, whoſe natural jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy had induced him to endeavour to deprive Cortes of the command of the expedition before he ſailed. He got the confidence of the officers and ſoldiers, and, having aſſembled a council, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the commiſſion he had received from Velaſquez, and was immediately choſen chief-juſtice and captain-general of the new colony.</p>
               <p>Cortes owed much of his ſucceſs to the Mexican gold, which he diſtributed with a liberal hand among both friends and opponents, and thereby brought all to be of one mind. Having thus ſettled every thing to the ſatisfaction of his army, by engaging it to join him in diſclaiming any
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025348_0120_0FCD00EF4D406138"/>dependance on the governor of Cuba, he thought he might now venture to quit the camp, in which he had hitherto remained, and advance into the country. To this he was en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ouraged by an event no leſs fortunate than ſeaſonable. He received a proffer of friendſhip from the Cazique of Zimpoalla, a conſiderable town at no great diſtance. He found by their meſſage, that they were filled with ſuch dread and hatred of Montezuma, that nothing could be more acceptable to them, than a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of deliverance from the oppreſſions under which they groaned. Cortes was highly delighted to find, that the great empire he intended to attack was not united, nor its ſovereign beloved.</p>
               <p>Some officers, whom Cortes had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſurvey the coaſt, having diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a village about forty miles to the northward, which, as well on account of the fertility of the ſoil, as commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He received Cortes with reſpect, almoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to adoration, and like one to whom he looked up as a deliverer. From
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025348_0121_0FCD00F144F0E868"/>the cazique he learned many particulars with reſpect to the character of Montezu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, whom he repreſented as a tyrant, haughty, cruel and ſuſpicious. Cortes aſſured the cazique, that one great object of the ſpaniards in viſiting a country ſo remote from their own, was to redreſs grievances, and to relieve the oppreſſed.</p>
               <p>Having taken his leave of the cazique, he continued his march to Quiabiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>an. The ſpot his officers had choſen as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſituation, appeared ſo well to meet his approbation, that he immediately marked out ground for a town. The houſes to be erected were only huts; but theſe were to be ſurrounded with fortifications, of ſufficient ſtrength to reſiſt the aſſaults of an indian army. Every one, even Cortes not excepted, gave an helping hand to the erecting of fortifications, ſo eſſential to the preſervation of every individual of the colony. His next care was to form an alliance with the neighbouring kings, whom he taught to deſpiſe their emperor, by gradually inſpiring them with an high opinion of the Spaniards, as beings of a ſuperior order, and irreſiſtible in arms.</p>
               <p>Cortes perceiving that ſome of his men grew tired of their preſent purſuits, and had even formed the plan of making their eſcape to Cuba in one of the ſhips, ſaw
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025348_0122_0FCD00F24961AC20"/>no hopes of ſucceſs, but in cutting off all poſſibility of retreat, and reducing his men to the neceſſity of adopting the ſame reſolutions with which he himſelf was ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, either to conquer or periſh. With this view he determined to deſtroy his fleet and his addreſs in peſuading his followers to adopt his ideas, was not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the boldneſs of the undertaking, With univerſal conſent the ſhips were drawn aſhore, and after ſtripping them of their ſail, rigging, iron work, and whatever elſe might be of uſe, they were broken in pieces. Thus from an effort of magnanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, to which there is nothing parallel in hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, five hundred men voluntarily conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be ſhut up in a hoſtile country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> filled with powerful and unknown nations; and having precluded every means of eſcape left themſelves without any reſource but what their own perſeverance and valour could procure them, and on which every thing now depended.</p>
               <p>On the 16th of Auguſt, 1519, Cortes began his march from Zimpoalla, with 500 men, fifteen horſe and ſix field pieces The remainder of his troops, conſiſting chiefly of ſuch as from age or infirmity were leſs fit for active ſervice, he left as a garriſon in Villa Rica, under the command of Eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lante, an officer of merit, and warmly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the intereſt of Cortes.</p>

The firſt war he engaged in was with the Haſcalens, who advanced againſt him with numerous armies, and attacked him in various forms, with a degree of valour and perſeverance to which the Spaniards had ſeen nothing equal in the new world. The Haſcalens, however were at laſt glad to ſue for peace, ſeeing their own people ſo dreadfully deſtroyed, while the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards remained unhurt. "If (ſaid they to the Spaniards) you are divinities of a cruel and ſavage nature, we preſent to you five ſlaves, that you may drink their blood and eat their fleſh. If you are mild deities, accept an offer of incenſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated plumes. If you are men, here is meat, and bread and fruit to nouriſh you." As both parties were equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of peace, matters were ſoon ſettled between them. The Haſcalens acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged themſelves as dependent on the crown of Caſtile; when Cortes took the republic under his protection, and prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed to ſecure them againſt every attempt of injury on their perſons or property.</p>
               <p>On the 13th of October, Cortes ſet out on his march for Mexico, accompanied by ſix thouſand Haſcalens, ſo that he now appeared at the head of ſomething like a regular army.

<pb n="110" facs="unknown:025348_0124_0FCD00F55829F578"/>over which the road lay, the vaſt plains of Mexico gradually unfolded itſelf to their view. This proſpect afforded one of the moſt ſtriking and beautiful views on the face of the earth; when they beheld fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and cultived fields, ſtretching beyond the reach of the human eye; when they ſaw a lake reſembling the ſea in extent, encompaſſed with large towns, and beheld the capital city riſing upon an iſland in the centre, adorned with its temples and turrets; the proſpect ſo far ſurpaſſed their moſt ſanguine expectations, that ſome believed the fancified deſcriptions of ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance were realized, and that its enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed palaces and gilded domes were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to their ſight; others could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuade themſelves, that this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſight was any thing more than a dream. As they proceeded their doubts were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, but their amazement encreaſed.</p>
               <p>Cortes was almoſt at the gates of the capital before Montezuma had determined, whether he ſhould receive him as a friend, or oppoſe him as an enemy. On their arrival near the city, about a thouſand perſons, who bore marks of diſtinction, can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:025348_0125_0FCD00F6CA7F87D0"/>to him according to the mode of their country. They announced the approach of Montezuma himſelf, and his harbingers ſoon after came in ſight. Two hundred perſons in an uniform dreſs firſt appeared, ornamented with feathers, proceeding two and two, barefooted, and in profound ſilence, with their eyes fixed on the ground. A company of higher rank next followed, in their moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ornaments; in the midſt of whom was Montezuma, in a litter richly orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with gold, and feathers of various colours. He was carried on the ſhoulders of four of his principal favorites, while others ſupported a canopy of curious workmanſhip over his head. Before him marched three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which they lifted up on high at certain intervals, when all the people immediately bowed their heads and hid their faces, as unworthy to look on ſo great a monarch. As ſoon as he approached Cortes diſmounted, advanced towards him with officious haſte, and in a reſpectful poſture. Montezuma immed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iately alighted from his chair, and leaning on the arms of two of his near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, approached with a ſlow and ſtately ſtep, his attendants covering the ſtreets with cotton cloth, that he might not
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:025348_0126_0FCD00F83B890720"/>touch the ground. Cortes accoſted him with profound reverence, after the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean faſhion; and Montezuma return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſalutation according to the mode of his country, by touching the earth with his hand, and then kiſſing it. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma conducted Cortes to the quarters he had prepared for his reception, and immediately took leave of him with a politeneſs not unworthy of a court more refined. Nothing material paſſed at this firſt interview.</p>
               <p>In the evening, Montezuma returned to viſit his gueſts with the ſame pomp as in their firſt interview. He told Cortes, that from what he had heard and ſeen of him and his followers, he was convinced that they were the very perſons, whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance the Mexican traditions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies taught them to expect, in order to reform their conſtitutions and laws; that he had accordingly received them not as ſtrangers, but as relations of the ſame blood and parentage, and deſired that they might conſider themſelves as maſters in his dominions, for both himſelf and his ſubjects ſhould be ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. The three ſubſequent days were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in viewing the city; the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which, ſo far ſuperior in the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:025348_0127_0FCD00FBB56B6658"/>of its buildings, and the number of its inhabitants, to any place the Spaniards had beheld in America, filled them with wonder and ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>Though the novelty of theſe objects amuſed the Spaniards, yet they were not without their alarms on account of their ſafety. The allies of the Spaniards aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cortes, that the Mexican prieſts had, in the name of the gods, counſelled their ſovereign to admit the Spaniards into the capital, that he might cut them off there at one blow with perfect ſecurity.</p>
               <p>Cortes very plainly perceived that his deſtruction was intended; it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary to extricate himſelf out of the difficulties, in which one bold ſtep had involved him, by venturing upon another ſtill bolder. The ſituation was trying but his mind was equal to it; and; after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving the matter with deep attention, he fixed upon a plan no leſs extraordinary th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the 4th of December, 1519, Qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copoca, the ſon of Montezuma, and five of the principal officers who ſerved under him, were brought priſoners to the citidel, formally tried by a Spaniſh courtmartial, and, though they had acted no other part than what became loyal ſubjects and brave men, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be burnt alive, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put in execution. The rigour with which Cortes puniſhed the unhappy perſons, who firſt preſumed to lay violent hands upon his followers, ſeems to have made all the impreſſions he deſired. The ſpirit of Montezuma was not only over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed, but ſubdued. During ſix months that Cortes remained in Mexico, the monarch continued in the Spaniſh quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with the appearance of an entire ſatisfaction, and tranquility, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he had reſided there, not from conſtraint, but through choice. His miniſters and officers
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025348_0129_0FCD00FE40340468"/>attended him as uſual, he took cognizance of all affairs, and every order was iſſued in his name. The external aſpect of government appearing the ſame, and all its ancient forms being ſcrupulouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the people were ſo little ſenſible of any change, that they obeyed the mandates of their monarch with the ſame ſubmiſſive reverence as ever. Thus, by the fortunate temerity of Cortes in ſeizing Montezuma, the Spaniards at once ſecured to themſelves more extenſive au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Cortes, encouraged by ſo many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the monarch's tame ſubmiſſion to his will ventured to put it to a proof ſtill more trying. He urged Montezuma to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge himſelf a vaſſal of the king of Caſtile, to hold his crown of him as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior, and to ſubject his dominions to the payment of an annual tribute. With this requiſition, the laſt and moſt humbling that can be made to one poſſeſſed of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign authority, Montezuma was ſo obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious as to comply. The act of ſubmiſſion and homage was executed with all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities the Spaniards were pleaſed to dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:025348_0130_0FCD010044932C50"/>
The next attempt Cortes made was to alter their religion, which had ſuch an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon the Mexicans, that they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to deſtroy the Spaniards if they perſiſted in it; and even Montezuma himſelf had expreſſed his with to Cortes, that he would think of returning home.</p>
               <p>While things continued in this critical ſituation, Cortes, anxious about what was paſt, uncertain with reſpect to the future, and much oppreſſed by the late declaration of the Mexicans, he received an account of ſome ſhips having appeared on the coaſt. He idly imagined that his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were returned from Spain, and that the completion of all his hopes and wiſhes were at hand.

               <p>This victory proved the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as it was gained with little bloodſhed, only two ſoldiers being killed on the ſide of Cortes, and two officers, with fifteen private men, of the adverſe faction. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes treated the vanquiſhed not like ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but as countrymen and friends, and offered to ſend them back immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to Cuba, or to take them into his ſervice, as partners in his fortune, on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual terms with his own ſoldiers. The greater part of them accepted the offer, and vied with each other in profeſſions of fidelity and attachment to a general, whoſe recent ſucceſſes had given them ſuch a ſtriking proof of his abilities. Thus, by a ſeries of events no leſs fortunate than uncommon, Cortes not only eſcaped from the deſtruction that ſeemed inevitable, but, when he had leaſt reaſon to expect it, was placed at the head of a thouſand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Spaniards.</p>
               <p>While Cortes was engaged in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Mexicans ſeized the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his abſence to take up arms, to which they had been more particularly urged by the cruelty and treachery of Alvarado,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025348_0132_0FCD0102CC1287C8"/>whom Cortes had left in the city, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take care of the royal priſoner and keep the natives in awe.</p>
               <p>On the 24th of June, 1520, Cortes marched back to the city and took quiet poſſeſſion of his ancient ſtation. Howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, being too much elated with his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, he neglected to viſit Montezuma, and embittered the inſult by expreſſions full of contempt for that unfortunate prince and his people. This being rumour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, they flew to arms in every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and attacked the Spaniards in their fortifications. Though the artillery point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their numerous battallions, crowded together in narrow ſtreets, ſwept off mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes at every diſcharge, though every blow of the Spaniſh weapons fell with mortal effects upon their naked bodies, the violence of the aſſault by no means abated. Freſh men ruſhed forward to occupy the places of the ſlain, and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ſame fate, were ſucceeded by others no leſs intrepid and eager for vengence. The utmoſt efforts and abilities of Cortes, ſeconded by the diſciplined valour of his troops, were hardly ſufficient to defend the fortifications of the Spaniards, into which the Mexicans had nearly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their way.</p>

Cortes was now willing to try what effect the ſight of ahe emperor would have upon his ſubjects. He was record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly brought on the ramparts, from whence he addreſſed the Mexicans, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to peaceable meaſures, which ſo enraged them, that he was ſoon wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by two arrows, and the blow of a ſtone on his temples brought him to the ground. The Spaniards carried him to his apartments; but he was ſo broken and dejected by the ſeverity of his fate, that he tore off the bandage from his wounds, and ſoon expired.</p>

He attempted his retreat by night, but the Mexicans, who had watched all his motions, fell upon him in his march and deſtroyed nearly one half of his army. All the artillery, ammutition, and baggage, were loſt, and only a very ſmall portion of the treaſure they had amaſſed was ſaved. Many of the ſoldiers, having ſo overloaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with bars of gold as rendered them unfit for action, and retarded their flight, fell ignominiouſly the victims of their own inconſiderate avarice.</p>

On the ſixth day of their march, they reached the ſummit of an eminence, when a ſpacious valley opened to their view, cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with a vaſt army, extending as far as the eye could reach. The Mexicans, while with one body of their troops they harraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spaniards in their retreat, had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled their principal force on the other ſide of the lake, and poſted it in the plain of Otumba, through which they knew Cortes muſt paſs. At the ſight of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible multitude, which they could ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey at once from the riſing ground, the Spaniards were aſtoniſhed, and even the boldeſt began to deſpair.

                  </gap>y reflection, after re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>minding them, that nothing remained but to die or conquer, led them immediately to the charge. The Mexicans with unuſual fortitude, waited their approach; but ſuch was the ſuperiority of the Spaniſh arms and dicipline, that the impreſſion of this ſmall body was irreſiſtible, and which ever way its force was directed, it penetrated and diſperſed the moſt numerous battalions.— However while theſe gave way in one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a freſh ſupply of enemies advanced from another, and the Spaniards, though ſucceſsful in every attack, were ready to ſink under theſe repeated efforts, without ſeeing any end of their toil, or any hope of victory.</p>

He fortunately recollected to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the event of every battle. He therefore aſſembled a few of his braveſt officers, whoſe horſes were ſtill capable of ſervice, and placing himſelf at their head, puſhed forwards towards the ſtandard, with an impetuoſity that bore down every thing before it. A choſen body of nobles, who guarded the ſtandard, made ſome reſiſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but were ſoon vanquiſhed. Cortes, with a ſtroke of his lance, wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the ground. One of the Spaniſh officers alighting, finiſhed his life, and ſeized the imperial ſtandard. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant their leader fell, and their ſtandard, to which all directed their eyes, was no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ſeen, an univerſal panic ſtruck the Mexican<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, every enſign was lowered, each ſoldier threw away his weapons, and every one made the beſt of his way to the mountains. The Spaniards, who were not in a condition to purſue them, contented themſelves with collecting the ſpoils of the field, which were ſo valuable, as to be ſome compenſation for the wealth they had loſt in the city of Mexico.</p>
               <p>After this victory, Cortes diſpatched an officer of confidence with four ſhips of
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:025348_0137_0FCD010AFA9C9F98"/>Narvaez's to Hiſpaniola and Jamaica, to engage adventurers, and to purchaſe horſes, gunpowder, and other military ſtores. As he knew it would be in vain to attempt the reduction of Mexico, unleſs he could ſecure the command of the lake he found means to procure materials for building twelve brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that they might be carried thith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in pieces, ready to be put together, and launched, whenever he ſhould want them.</p>
               <p>While he was harraſſed and perplexed with the mutinous diſpoſition of his troops, two ſhips arrived, with a ſupply of men and military ſtores, ſent by the governor of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, not to aſſiſt Cortes, but with a view to complete his ruin. His addreſs, however, brought them over to his views. He now found his army reinforced with 180 Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards, and twenty horſes.</p>
               <p>Soon after this four ſhips arrived at Vera Cruz from Hiſpaniola, with two hundred ſoldiers, eighty horſes, and two battering cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>On the 28th of April, 1521, all the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh troops, together with the auxiliary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were drawn up on the banks of the Ganal; and with extraordinary military pomp, heightened and rendered more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn by the celebration of the moſt ſacred rights of religion, the brigantines were
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025348_0138_0FCD010D4220C8D8"/>launched. Cortes now determined on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an attack on the city of Mexico.— The brigantines no ſooner appeared before the city, than the lake was covered with innumerable canoes, which made but a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reſiſtance againſt theſe veſſels, manned by Europeans. The brigantines, with the utmoſt eaſe, broke through their feeble op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, overſet many canoes, and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole armament with ſuch ſlaughter, as convinced the Mexicans, that it was not in their power to contend with the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards on the watery element.</p>
               <p>Cortes now determined to attack the city, and for this purpoſe he made all the wiſe preparations an able general could do; but, owing to his orders not being properly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, he was at laſt repulſed, received ſome dangerous wounds and would have been taken by the Mexicans, had not ſome Spaniſh officers reſcued him at the expenſe of their lives. Forty Spaniards fell alive into the hands of the Mexicans, who ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed thoſe unhappy victims, in the moſt cruel manner, to their god of war.</p>
               <p>However unpromiſing an aſpect matters wore at preſent, Cortes had a mind that roſe above all difficulties. He ſoon found himſelf enabled to renew the attack on the city of Mexico, in which he proved o for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, that he took the emperor Guatimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin priſoner, who ſeemed worthy of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025348_0139_0FCD010EC4F35D50"/>fate. When the emperor was conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Cortes, he appeared neither with the ſullen fierceneſs of a barbarian, nor with the dejection of a ſupplicant. "I have done (ſaid he, addreſſing himſelf to the Spaniſh general) what became a monarch. I have defended my people to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. Nothing now remains but to die.

               <p>As ſoon as the fate of this unfortunate ſovereign was known, the Mexicans ceaſed all reſiſtance, and Cortes took poſſeſſion of that ſmall part of the capital, which had not been deſtroyed during the ſiege.

The Spaniards were no ſooner maſters of the city, than they ſet about ſeeking for the profuſe riches they expected it would produce; but they were herein ſadly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.

The court of Spain ſen a perſon to ſuperſede him, to ſeize his perſon, and confiſcate his effects; but Cortes triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over all his enemies, and was appointed Captain-General and Governor of New-Spain.</p>
               <p>The jealouſies and ingratitude of the court of Spain threw ſo many obſtacles in the way of Cortes, that his government became very uneaſy to him, and the court went ſo far as to ſend perſons to enquire into his conduct, and to bring him to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſhould his intereſted judges find him guilty. He reſolved, however, not to expoſe himſelf to the ignominy of a trial, in that country, which had been the ſcene of his triumphs; and without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the arrival of his judges, to repair directly to Caſtile, and commit himſelf and his cauſe to the juſtice and generoſity of his King.</p>
               <p>The Emperor Charles, having now nothing to apprehend from the deſigns of Cortes, received him at Court like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom conſcious innocence had brought into the preſence of his maſter, and who was entitled, by the eminence of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, to the higheſt marks of diſtinction and reſpect.

               <p>Cortes returned to New-Spain; but his power was ſo cramped, that he found himſelf ‖in a very diſagreeable ſituation. He formed ſchemes for new diſcoveries, explored California, and ſurveyed the greater part of the Gulf which ſeparates it from New-Spain. On his return to his government be found himſelf ſurrounded with ſo many enemies, that he determined once more to ſeek redreſs in his native country.</p>
               <p>On his arrival in Old Spain, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror behaved to him with cold civility, his miniſters treated him ſometimes with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, and ſometimes with inſolence. His grievances received no redreſs, his claims were urged without effect, and ſeveral years paſſed in fruitleſs applications to miniſters and judges; an occupation the moſt irkſome and mortifying to a man of ſpirit. Cortes finiſhed his mortal career on the ſecond day of December, 1547, in the ſixty-ſecond year of his age, having experienced the ſame fate with that of all the perſons who diſtinguiſhed themſelves in the diſcovery or conqueſt of the New World: envied by his cotemporaries, and ill requited by the courts he ſerved, he has

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <p>THE diſcovery of the Southern Ocean by Balboa excited a ſpirit of adventure in the colonies of Darien and Panama, who ſighed after the imaginary wealth of thoſe unknown regions. Several armaments were fitted out in 1523, in order to explore and take poſſeſſion of the countries to the Eaſt of Panama, but under the conduct of leaders, whoſe talents and reſources were unequal to the attempt. The proved unſucceſsful, and thereby damped the ardor of others.</p>
               <p>Three perſons ſettled in Panama, whoſe names were Franciſco Pizarro. Diego de Almagro and Hernando Luque, reſolved to attempt the diſcovery of Peru, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ill ſucceſs of former adventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Theſe three men were deſtined to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn one of the moſt extenſive empires on the face of the earth; though Pizarro was a baſtard, with very little education; Almagro a foundling; and Luque, a prieſt and ſchoolmaſter at Panama.</p>
               <p>Each engaged to employ his whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune in this adventure. Pizarro, being the pooreſt of the three, undertook the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of the greateſt fatigue and danger,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025348_0147_0FCD011C9B641D90"/>and to command in perſon the armament deſtined for the diſcovery. Almagro was to conduct the ſupplies of proviſions and reinforcement of troops, of which Pizarro might ſtand in need. Luque was to remain at Panama to negociate with the governor, and ſuperintend whatever was carrying on for the general good. As the ſpirit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm uniformly accompanied that of adventure in the New World, and by that ſtrange union both acquired an increaſe of force, this confederacy formed by ambition and avarice, was confirmed by the moſt ſolemn act of religion. Luque celebrated maſs, divided a conſecrated hoſt into three, and reſerving one part to himſelf, gave the other two to his aſſociates, of which they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and thus, in the name of the Prince of Peace, ratified a contract, of which plunder and bloodſned were the principal objects in view.</p>
               <p>On the 14th of November, 1525, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro ſet ſail from Panama with a ſingle veſſel of ſmall burthen, and 112 men. His vovage, however, was attended with great difficulties and hardſhips. After re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining five months in the iſland of Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona, noted for the moſt unhealthy climate in that region of America. A veſſel arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Panama. This tranſported them with ſuch joy, that all their former ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were forgotten. Their hopes revived,
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:025348_0148_0FCD011DC0345288"/>and Pizarro ſound little ciffienlty to indu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e not only his own followers, but alſo the crew of the veſſel from Panama, to reſume his former ſcheme with no left ardor. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of returning to Panama, they ſtood towards the South Eaſt, and more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in this than in any of their paſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, on the twentieth day after their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Gorgona, they diſcovered the coaſt of Peru.</p>
               <p>After touching at ſeveral village on the coaſt, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, a place of ſome note, about three degrees ſouth of the line, diſtinguiſhed for its ſtately temple, and a palace of the Incas, or ſovereigus of the country. There the Spaniards feaſted their eves with the firſt view of the opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and civilization of the Peruvian em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. They beheld a country fully peopled and cultivated with an appearance of regular induſtry; the natives decently cloathed, and poſſeſſed of ingenuity ſo far ſurpaſſing the other inhabitants of the New World, as to have the uſe of tame and domeſtie aninals. But what chiefly attracted their notice, was ſuch a ſhow of gold and ſilver not only in the ornaments of their perſons and temples, but in ſeveral veſſels and utenſils for common uſe, formed of thoſe precious metals as left no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oom to doubt that it abounded with profuſion in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Pizarro and his companions, now
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:025348_0149_0FCD011F95816EA0"/>ſeemed to have attained the completion of their moſt ſanguine hopes, and fancied that all their wiſhes and dreams of rich domains, and inexhauſtible treaſures, would ſoon be realized.</p>
               <p>Pizarro, having explored the country as far as it was neceſſary to aſcertain the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the diſcovery, procured from the inhabitants ſome of their <hi>Llamas,</hi> or ſame cattle, to which the Spaniards gave the name of ſheep; ſome veſſels of gold and ſilver, as well as ſome ſpecimens of their other works of ingenuity; and two young men, whom he propoſed to inſtruct in the Coſtilian language, that they might ſerve as interpeters in the expedition he meditated. With theſe he arrived at Panama, towards the cloſe of the third year from the time of his departure thence. No adventurer of the age ſuffered hardſhips or encountered dangers which equal thoſe to which he was expoſed during this long period.</p>
               <p>On their arrival at Panama, Pizarro could not prevail on the governor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>, where he managed matters more to his own inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt than to theirs. On the 26th of July, 1528, Pizarro was appointed governor, captain general, and adelantado of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries he had diſcovered and hoped to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, with ſupreme authority, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="136" facs="unknown:025348_0150_0FCD01224EFDD848"/>as military: thus he ſecured to himſelf what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his boundleſs ambition could deſire.</p>
               <p>After all the efforts of Pizarro and his aſſociates, there ſmall veſſels, with 180 ſoldiers, 36 of whom were horſemen, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the whole of the armament. With this contemptible force, in February, 1531, Pizarro did not heſitate to ſail to invade a great empire.</p>
               <p>He no ſooner landed in Peru, than he began hoſtilities, by which imprudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct his followers were expoſed to famine, fatigue, and diſeaſes of various kinds. However they at lenght reached the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince of Coaque; and having ſurpiſed the principal ſettlement of the natives, they ſeized there, veſſels and ornaments of gold and ſilver to the amount of thirty thouſand peſos, with other booty of ſuch value, as diſpelled all their fears, and inſpired the moſt deſponding with ſanguine hopes.</p>
               <p>The dominions of the ſovereigns of Peru, at the time that the Spaniards invaded them, extended in length, from north to ſouth, above fifteen hundred miles along the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific Ocean. Its breadth from eaſt to weſt, was much leſs conſiderable, being uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bounded by the vaſt ridge of the Andes, ſtretching from its one extremity to the other.</p>
               <p>Pizarro, ſoon after his landing in Peru, diſcovered that a civil war was carrying on
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:025348_0151_0FCD012428B9CBE8"/>in that country. By theſe means he was permitted to purſue his operations unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted, and advanced to the centre of a great ompire, before one effort of its power was exerted to ſtop his career. The firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete information the Spaniards received of this war, was by meſſengers from Huaſcar, one of the contending parties, ſcut to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro, in order to ſolicit his aid againſt his opponent Atahualpa. Pizarro at once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the importance of this intelligence and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reſaw ſo clearly all the advantages, which might be derived from this divided ſtate of the kingdom he had invaded, that without waiting for the reinforcements he expected from Panama, he determined to puſh forward, while inteſtine diſcord put it out of the power of the Peruvians to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack him with their whole force, and while by taking part, as circumſtances ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him, with one of the competitors, he might be enabled with greater eaſe to cruſh them both.</p>
               <p>Strange as it may appear, Pizarro mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched into the heart of the country attended by his followers, conſiſting only of 62 horſemen, and 102 foot ſoldiers, of whom twenty were armed with croſs bows, and three with muſkets. Pizarro in the courſe of as march, received an embaſſador from the luca of Caramalca, who brought him very valuable preſents from that Prince, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:025348_0152_0FCD01259E456F78"/>with a proſſer of alliance. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro according to the uſual artifice of his country men in America promiſed every thing without meaning to fulfil any thing but what his intereſt directed. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of theſe declarations, the Spaniards were permitted to march where they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>On entering Caxamalca, Pizarro took poſſeſſion of a large court, on one ſide of which was a houſe, which the Spaniſh hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians call a palace of the Inca, and on the other a temple of the Sun, the whoſe ſurrounded with a ſtrong rampart or wall of earth. When he had poſted his troops in this advantageous ſituation, and had ſeen what profuſion of riches the inca poſſeſſed, Pizarro treacherouſly ſeized on his perſon, during the interview to which the monarch had invited him. While the Inca was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paged in conference with the Spaniards. Pizarro gave the ſignal of aſſault. At once the martial muſick ſtruck up, the cannon and muſkets began to fire, the horſe fallied out fiercely to the charge, and the infantry ruſhed on ſword in hand. The Peruvians aſtoniſhed at the ſuddenneſs of the attack which they did not expect, and diſmayed which the deſtructive effect of fire arms, and the irreſiſtable impreſſion of the cavalry, fled with univerſal conſternation in eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> quarter, without attempring either to annoy
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:025348_0153_0FCD0126C43842E0"/>the enemy, or to defend themſelves. Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro at the head of his followers, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced directly towards the inca; and though his nobles crowded around him with offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious zeal, and fell in numbers at his feet, while they vied one with another in ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their own lives, that they might cover the ſacred perſon of their king, the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards ſoon penetrated to the royal feat, and Pizarro ſeizing the Inca by the arm, drag ged him to the ground, and carried him as a priſoner to his quarters. The fate of the monarch precipitated the flight of his followers. The Spaniards every where purſued them, and with a deliberate unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting barbarity, continued to ſlaughter the wretched Peruvians, who never attempted to reſiſt. The carnage did not ceaſe till the cloſe of the day put an end to it, when above four thouſand Peruvians lay dead on the ſpot. Not a ſingle Spaniard fell, nor was any one wounded but Pizarro him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, whoſe hand was ſlightly hurt.</p>
               <p>The plunder the Spaniards acquired on this maſſacre, was far beyond every thing they had formed in their minds of the wealth of Peru, and they were ſo tranſported with the value of the acquiſition as well as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſucceſs, that they paſſed the night in thoſe extravagant exultations natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to indigent adventurers on ſo ſudden a change in their affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:025348_0154_0FCD01284A150A18"/>
The captive monarch could at firſt hardly believe what he ſaw to be real, and the dejection into which he ſunk was in proportion to the height of grandeur from which he had fallen. However, the Inca ſoon diſcovered the ruling paſſion of the Spaniards, and by applying to that made an attempt to recover his liberty. He offered as a ranſom what aſtoniſhed the Spaniards, even after all they now knew concerning the opulence of his kingdom. The apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which he was confined was twenty-two feet in length, and ſixteen in breadth; he underoook to fill it with veſſels of gold as high as he could reach. Pizarro eagerly cloſed with this tempting propoſal, and a line was drawn upon the wall of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to mark the ſtipulated height to which the treaſure was to reach.</p>
               <p>As faſt as the gold was brought in, it was melted down, except ſome pieces of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fabric, which were reſerved as a preſent for the emperor. After ſetting apart the fifth due to the crown, and an hundred thouſand peſos as a donative to the ſoldiers, who were juſt arrived with Almagro, there remained 1,528,500 peſos to Pizarro and his followers. The feſtival of St. James, (July 25, 1513) the patron ſaint of Spain, was the day choſen for the partition of this vaſt ſum. Though aſſembled to divide the ſpoils of an innnocent people procured
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:025348_0155_0FCD012AD10CF1C8"/>by deceit, extortion and cruelty, the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action began with a ſolemn invocation of the name of God, as if they could have expected the guidance of heaven in diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe wages of iniquity. In this diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution 8000 peſos, at that time not inferior in effective value, to as many pounds her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the preſent century, fell to the ſhare of each horſeman, and half that ſum to each foot ſoldier. Pizarro, and his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers received their dividened in proportion to their ſuperior ſtation,</p>
               <p>The Inca having thus fulfilled his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, demanded his releaſe; but the treachery of the Spaniards induced them inſtead of ſetting him at liberty, to put a period to his life. He was tried and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be burnt alive. At laſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate prince conſented to receive bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and was therefore indulged with being ſtrangled at the ſtake.</p>
               <p>Pizarro, having by theſe cruel proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings eſtabliſhed his authority in Caxamalca, no longer heſitated to advance towards Cuzco; and, having received conſiderable reinforcements, he could venture, with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle danger to penetrate into the interior part of the country. The Peruvians had aſſembled ſome large bodies of troops to oppoſe his progreſs, and ſeveral fierce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters happened; but they terminated like all the actions in America: a few
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:025348_0156_0FCD012CBAC30F70"/>Spaniards were killed or wounded, and the natives were put to flight with incredible ſlaughter. At length Pizarro forced his way to Cuzco, and took quiet poſſeſſion of the capital. The riches found there, even after all the natives had carried off and concealed, either from a ſuperſtitious vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the ornaments of their temples, or out of hatred to their rapacious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, exceeded in value what had been received as the Inca's ranſom. However, as Pizarro's forces were now more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, the common ſoldiers did not receive ſo much as they expected, which proved a diſappointment to their rapacity.</p>
               <p>After all theſe conqueſts, Pizarro ſet out for his native country, and arrived in Spain in 1534. The immenſe quantities of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>old and ſilver which he imported, filled the kingdom with aſtoniſtment. Pizarro was received by the Emperor with the attention due to the bearer of a preſent ſo rich, as to exceed any idea the Spaniards had formed concerning the value of their acquiſitions in America, even after they had been ten years maſters of Mexico. Pizarro was admitted into the order of St. Jago. and, after getting his authority confirmed with new powers and privileges, he ſet out on his return to Peru, accompanied by many perſons of higher rank than had yet ſerved in that country. Almagro received the

               <p>On his arival at Peru, he found Almagro in arms oppoſing his intereſt, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oring to do himſelf juſtice for the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conduct of Pizarro, who had engroſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf all the honors and emoluments, which ought to have been divided with his aſſociate. However, matters were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated between them. Their new agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was confirmed with the ſame power of ſolemnities as the firſt, and obſerved with as little fidelity.</p>
               <p>Cuaco, the capital city of the Incas, was ſituated in a corner of the empire, above four hundred miles from the ſea, and much further from Quito, a province of whoſe value he had formed an high ideas. No other ſettlement of the Peruvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans was ſo conſiderable as to merit the name of a town, or to allure the Spaniards to fix their reſidence in it. Pizarro, in marching through the country, had been ſtruck with the beauty and fertility of the valley of Rimac, one of the moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and beſt cultivated in Peru. There, on the bank of a ſmall river of the ſame name with the vale which it waters and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:025348_0158_0FCD013082DED148"/>at the diſtance of ſix miles from Callao, the moſt commodious harbor in the Pacific Ocean, he founded a city, which he deſtined to be the capital of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. On the 18th of January, 1535, he gave it the name of C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This name it ſtill retains among the Spaniards in all legal and formal deeds, but it is better known to foreigners by that of <hi>Lima,</hi> a corruption of the ancient appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the valley in which it is ſituated. Under his inſpection, the buildings advanced with ſuch rapidity, that it ſoon aſſumed the form of a city, which by a magnificient pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace that he erected for himſelf, and by the ſtately houſes built by ſeveral of his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, gave a ſtrong proof of the grandeur it was at laſt to acquire.</p>
               <p>Almagro, as agreed on between him and Pizarro, ſet out for Chili; but on his march, he met with ſo many hardſhips and difficulties, that many of his men died with fatigue. They no ſooner entered on the fertile plains of Chili, than they met with new difficulties to encounter. They there ſound a race of men very different from the people of Peru, intrepid, hardy,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:025348_0159_0FCD013212265108"/>independent, and in their bodily conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as well as vigour of ſpirit, nearly reſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Spaniards, however, continued to penetrate into the country, and collected ſome conſiderable quantities of gold, when they were recalled to Peru by an unexpected event.</p>
               <p>The Inca of Peru, having obſerved the inconſiderate ſecurity of the Spaniards in diſperſing their troops, and that only a handful of ſoldiers remained in Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Inca, who was the priſoner of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro, obtained permiſſion from him to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a great feſtival, which was to be celebrated a few leagues from the capital.

<pb n="146" facs="unknown:025348_0160_0FCD01338118F5C8"/>ſoon as the Inca joined them, the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of war was erected, and, in a ſhort time, all the fighting men, form the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Quito to the frontiers of Chili, were in arms. Many Spaniards, living ſecurely on the ſettlements allotted them, were maſſacred. Several detachments, as they marched careleſsly through a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which ſeemed to be tamely ſubmiſſive to their dominion, were out off to a man. The Spaniſh writers aſſert, that the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruvian army amounted to 200,000 men, and with this powerful army, and their Inca at the head of it, they laid ſiege to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uzco. During nine months they carried on the ſiege with inceſſant ardour, and in various forms. The Inca, in ſpite of the valour of the Spaniards, recovered poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of one half of his capital; and, in their various efforts to drive him out of it, Pizarro loſt one of his brothers, and ſome other perſons of note.</p>
               <p>Almagro arrived at Cuzco in a critical moment. The Inca at firſt endeavoured to gain the friendſhip of Almagro; but af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="unknown:025348_0161_0FCD01360AD07A78"/>were repulſed with ſuch ſlaughter, that a great part of their army diſperſed, and Almagro proceeded to the gates of Cuzco without oppoſition.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards had no ſooner got rid of their Peruvian enemies, than they began to quarrel among themſelves, and the flame at laſt burſt out into civil war. Tho' countrymen and friends, the ſubjects of the ſame ſovereign, each with the royal ſtandard diſplayed! and though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the mountains that ſurrounded the plain in which they were drawn up, cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with a vaſt multitude of Indians, aſſembled to enjoy the ſpectacle of their mutual carnage, and prepared to attack whatever party remained maſter of the field; ſo fell and implacable was the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour which had taken poſſeſſion of every breaſt, that not one pacific council, not a ſingle overture towards accommodation, proceeded from either ſide. Almagro was defeated and taken, tried by the Pizarros as guilty of treaſon, and condemned and executed, in 1538.</p>
               <p>However rapid the progreſs of the Spaniards had been in South America ſince Pizarro landed in Peru, their avidity of dominion was not yet ſatisfied. The officers to whom Ferdinand Pizarro gave the command of different detachments,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:025348_0162_0FCD0137595AA578"/>penetrated into ſeveral new provinces, and though ſome of them were expoſed to great hardſhips in the cold and barren re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Andes, and others ſuffered diſtreſs not inferior amidſt the woods and marſhes of the plains, they made diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and conqueſts which not only extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their knowledge of the country, but added conſiderably to the territories of Spain in the New World. Pedro de Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divia reaſſumed Almagro's ſcheme of inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chili, and notwithſtanding the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the natives in defending their poſſeſſions, made ſuch progreſs in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the country, that he founded the city of St. Jago, and gave a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the eſtabliſhment of the Spaniſh dominions in that province.</p>
               <p>Gonzalo Pizarro, whom his brother Franciſco had made governor of Quito, had entruſted one of his confidential offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, named Orellana, with an expedition on diſcoveries, appointing a proper place where they were to meet; but this young officer began to fancy himſelf independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and, tranſported with the predom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is impoſſible to deſcribe the conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Pizarro, when he did not find the bark at the confluence of the Napo and Maragnon, where he had ordered Orellana to wait for him; but that treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous ſervant, after having made ſome diſcoveries, got back to Spain, and there magnified his wonderful exploits. In the mean time, Pizarro was twelve hundred miles from Quito; and, in that long march towards the capital, the Spaniards encountered hardſhips greater than thoſe they had endured in their progreſs out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, without the alluring hopes that then foothed and animated them under their ſuperings. Hunger compelled them to feed on roots and berries, to eat all their dogs and horſes, to devour the moſt loathſome reptiles, and even to knaw the leather of their ſaddles and ſword belts. Four thouſand Indians, and two hundred and ten Spaniards periſhed in this wild and diſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Gonzalo Pizarro was not much more happy on his arrival at his government of Quito, where he found every thing in a

In this young man the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magrians found a point of union which they wanted, and looking up to him as their head, were ready to undertake any thing to promote his intereſt. Their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for Almagro was not the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, being urged on by their own diſtreſſes. Many of them, deſtitute of common neceſſaries, and weary of loiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away life a burden to their chief, or to ſuch of their aſſociates as had ſaved ſome remnant of their fortune from pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and confiſcation ſighed for an occaſion to exert their activity and courage, and
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:025348_0165_0FCD013D75DAB288"/>began to deliberate how they might be avenged on the author of all their miſery. Juan de Harrada, an officer of great abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, who had the charge of Almagro's education, took the direction of their conſultations, with all the zeal which this connection inipired, and with all the authority which the aſcendency that he was known to have over the mind of his pupil gave him.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, the 6th of June, 1541, at midnight, the ſeaſon of tranquility and repoſe in all ſul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their aſſociates, warned of their motions by a ſignal, were in arms at different ſtations to ſupport them.— Though Pizarro was uſually ſurrounded by ſuch a numerous train of attendants, as ſuited the magnificence of the moſt opulent ſubject of the age in which he lived, yet he was juſt riſen from table, and moſt of his domeſties had retired to their own apartments, ſo that the conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators paſſed through the two outward courts of the palace unobſerved. They were at the botom of the ſtaircaſe, before a page in waiting could give the alarm to
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:025348_0166_0FCD013EDA09B5E0"/>his maſter, who was converſing with a few friends in a large hall. The governor, whoſe ſteady mind no form of danger could alter, ſtarting up, called for arms, and commanded Franciſco de Chaves to make faſt the door: but that officer, who did not retain ſo much preſence of mind as to obey this prudent order, running to the top of the ſtaircaſe, wildly aſked the conſpirators what they meant, and whither they were going. Inſtead of anſwering, they ſtabbed him to the heart, and burſt into the hall. Some of the perſons who were there threw themſelves from the windows, others attempted to fly, and a few, drawing their ſwords, followed their leader into an inner apartment. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, animated with having the object of their vengeance now in view, ruſhed forward after them. Pizarro, with no other arms than his ſword and buckler, defended the entry, and ſupported by his half brother Aleantara, and his little knot of friends, he maintained the unequal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with intrepidity worthy of his paſt exploits and with the vigour of a youthful combatant. "Courage, (he cried) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As ſoon as Pizarro was killed, the aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins ran out into the ſtreets, and waving their bloody ſwords, proclaimed the death of the tyrant.

On the 16th of September, 1542, they met at Chupaz, about two hundred miles from Cuzco, and fought with all the fierce animoſity inſpired by the violence of civil rage, the rancour of private en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the eagerneſs of revenge, and the laſt efforts of deſpair. Victory, after remaining long doubtful, declared at laſt for Vaco de Caſtro. The carnage was great in proportion to the number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants. Of 1400 men, the total amount of the armies on both ſides, five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred lay dead on the field, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the wounded was ſtill greater. Of the priſoners, Caſtro condemned ſome to death, others were baniſhed Peru, and Almagro being taken, was publickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</p>
               <p>The feelings of the emperor were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly hurt at the recital of ſo many actions ſhocking to humanity. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that relieving the Indians from oppreſſion was but one ſtep towards ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his poſſeſſions in the New World a valuable acquiſition, and would be of little avail, unleſs he could circumſcribe the power and uſurpations of his own ſubjects there.

Pizarro was beheaded on the day after he ſurrendered. He ſubmitted to his rate with a compoſed dignity, and ſeemed deſirous to atone by repentance for the crimes he had commited.</p>
               <p>Pizarro was no ſooner dead, than the malcontents in every quarter of Peru laid down their arms, and tranquility was ſoon reſtored. Gaſca then endeavored to find employment for the mutinous ſoldiers who had laid down their arms, which he did by engaging them in the conqueſt of Chili. In order to reward his own ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he made a diviſion of the country among them, without reſerving the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt portion to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Gaſca, having now accompliſhed every object of his miſſion, and longing to return again to a private ſtation, committed the government of Peru to the court of andi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſet out for Spain on the firſt of February, 1550.</p>
               <p>There had been no remittance of the royal revenue for four years, owing to the diſtracted ſtate of the country. Gaſca, however, on his return to Spain, carried with him 1,300,000 peſos of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic money, which the prudence and good order of adminiſtration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>HAVING now taken a review of the conqueſt of the two great empires of Mexico and Peru, very little more ſeems worthy of notice in the Hiſtory of South America than to mention a ſew circumſtances relative to their political inſtitutions and national manners.</p>
               <p>According to the account of the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans themſelves, their empire was not of long continuance. They relate, that their country was originally poſſeſſed, rather than peopled, by ſmall independent tribes, whoſe manners and mode of life reſembled thoſe of the rudeſt ſavages in South Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica. About a period correſponding to the beginning of the tenth century in the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian aera, ſeveral tribes moved in ſucceſſive migrations from unknown regions towards the north and north weſt, and ſettled in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent provinces of Ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, the ancient name of New Spain. Theſe, more civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed than the original inhabitants, began to form them to the arts of ſocial life. At length, towards the commencement of the thirteenth century, the Mexicans, a people more poliſhed than any of the former, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced from the borders of the Californian gulf and took poſſeſſion of the plains adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to a great lake near the centre of the
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:025348_0176_0FCD0153CCBF2B18"/>country. After reſiding there about fifty years they founded a town, ſince diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which from humble beginnings ſoon grew to be the moſt conſiderable city in the New World. The Mexicans, long after they were eſtabliſhed in their new poſſeſſions, continued, like other martial tribes in America, unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with regal dominion; and were governed in peace, and conducted in war, by ſuch as were entitled to pre-eminence by their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or their valour. Among them, as in other ſtates, whoſe power and territories become extenſive, the ſupreme authority centred at laſt in a ſingle perſon: and when the Spaniards under Cortes invaded the country, Montezuma was the ninth mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch in order, who had ſwayed the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſceptie, not by hereditary right, but by election. Such is the traditional tale of the Mexicans concerning the progreſs of their own empire, which, according to this account, muſt have been but of ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>While the juriſdiction of the Mexican monarchs was limited, it is probable that much oſtentation was not exerciſed; but as their authority became more extenſive, the ſplendour of their government encreaſed. It was in this laſt ſtate the Spaniards beheld it, and ſtruck with the appearance of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma's court, they deſcribe its pomp at
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:025348_0177_0FCD0155394C7118"/>great length, and with much admiration. The number of his attendants, the order, the ſilence, and the reverence with which they ſerved him; the vaſt extent of his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manſion, the variety of apartments allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to different officers, and the oſtentation with which his grandeur was diſplayed whenever he permitted his ſubjects to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, ſeem to reſemble the magnificence of the ancient monarchies in Aſia, rather than the ſimplicity of the infant ſtates in the New World.</p>
               <p>The Mexicans like the rude tribes among them, were inceſſantly engaged in war, and the motives that prompted them to hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſeem to have been the ſame. They fought in order to gratify their vengeance, by ſhedding the blood of their enemies. In battle, they were chiefly intent on taking priſoners, and it was by the number of theſe that they eſtimated the glory of victory. No captives were ever ranſomed or ſpared: all were ſacrificed without mercy, and their fleſh devoured with the ſame barbarous joy as among the fierceſt ſavages. On ſome occaſions, it roſe to even wilder exceſſes. Their principal warriors covered themſelves with the ſkins of the unhappy victims, and danced about the ſtreets, boaſting of their own valour, and exulting over their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="unknown:025348_0178_0FCD01571A62BED8"/>
Their funeral rites were no leſs bloody than thoſe of the moſt ſavage tribes. On the death of any diſtinguiſhed perſonage, eſpecially of the emperor, ſeveral of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants were choſen to accompany him to the other world, and theſe unfortunate vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims were put to death without mercy, and buried in the ſame tomb.</p>
               <p>Though the agriculture of the Mexicans was more extenſive than that of the roving tribes, who truſted chiefly to their bow for food, it ſeems not to have ſupplied them with ſuch ſubſiſtence as men require when engaged in efforts of active induſtry. The Spaniards appear not to have been ſtruck with any ſuperiority of the Mexicans over the other people of America in bodily vigor. Both, according to their obſervation, were of ſuch a feeble frame as to be unable to endure fatigue, and the ſtrength of one Spaniard exceeded that of ſeveral indians. This they imputed to their ſcanty diet, on poor fare, ſufficient to preſerve life, but not to give firmneſs to the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>In Mexico, though the diſpoſition of the houſes was ſomewhat orderly, yet the ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the greater part of them was mean. Nor does the fabric of their temples, and other public edifices, appear to have been ſuch as entitled them to the high praiſes beſtowed upon them by many Spaniſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hors. The great temple of Mexico, the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:025348_0179_0FCD0159732F31F8"/>moſt famous in New Spain, which has been repreſented as a magnificent building, raiſed to ſuch a height, that the aſcent to it was by a ſtaircaſe of an hundred and fourteen ſteps, was a ſolid maſs of earth of a ſquare form, faced partly with ſtone. Its baſe on each ſide extended ninety feet, and decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gradually as it advanced in height, it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in a quadrangle of about thirty feet, where were placed a inrine of the deity, and two altars on which the victims were ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed. Greater ſkill and ingenuity were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, if we may believe me Spanith hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians, in the houſes of the emperor, and in thoſe of the principal nobility. There ſome elegance of deſign was viſible, and a commodious arrangement of the apartments was attended to; but if buildings correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponding to ſuch deſcriptions had ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted in the Mexican cities, it is probable that ſome remains of them would ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The empire of <hi>Peru</hi> boaſts of an higher antiquity than that of Mexico. According to the traditionary accounts collected by the Spaniards, it had ſubſiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed near four hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red years under twelve ſucceſſive monarchs; but the knowledge of their ancient ſtory, which the Peruvians could communicate to their conquerors, muſt have been both imperfect and uncertain. Like the other American nations, they were totally unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the art of writing, and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the only means, by which the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of paſt tranſactions can be preſerved with any degree of accuracy.</p>
               <p>The authority of the Inca was unlimited and abſolute, in the moſt extenſive mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:025348_0181_0FCD015BF83B5ED8"/>of the words. Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ver the decrees of a prince are conſidered as the commands of the divinity, it is not only an act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, but of impiety, to diſpute or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his will. Obedience becomes a duty of religion; and as it would be profane to controul a monarch under the guidance of heaven, and preſumptuous to adviſe him, nothing remains but to ſubmit with implicit reſpect. This muſt neceſſarily be the effect of every government eſtabliſhed on preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of intercourſe with ſuperior powers. Such accordingly was the blind ſubmiſſion which the Peruvians yielded to their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
               <p>The Incas of Peru were immenſely rich in gold and ſilver, long before they knew any thing of the rich ſilver mines of Potoſi, which were accidentally diſcovered in the year 1545, by an indian, as he was clamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the mountains in purſuit of a Llama which had ſtrayed from his flock. Soon after the mines of Sacotecas in New Spain, little inferior to the other in value, were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. From that time ſucceſſive diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries have been made in both colonies, and ſilver mines are now ſo numerous, that the working of them, and of ſome few mines of gold in the province of Tierra Firme, and the new kingdom of Grenada, has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the capital occupation o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To return: the wars in which the Incas engaged, were carried on with a ſpirit very different from thoſe of other American na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They fought not like ſavages, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy or extirminate, or, like the Mexicans, to glut bloodthirſly divinities with human ſacrifices.

The Incas took the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom they ſubdued under their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and admitted them to a participation of all the advantages enjoyed by their orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal ſubjects.</p>
               <p>In Peru, agriculture, the art of primary neceſſity in ſocial life, was more extenſive, and carried on with greater ſkill, than in any other part of America.

               <p>The ingenuity of the Peruvians was alſo conſpicuous in the conſtruction of their houſes and public buildings. In the extenſive plains which ſtretch along the pacific o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, where the ſky is perpetually ſerene, and the climate mild, their houſes were very properly built only of ſlight materials; but in the higher regions, where rain falls, where the viciſſitudes of ſeaſons are known, and their rigor felt, houſes were conſtructed with greater ſolidity. They were generally of a ſquare form, the walls about eight feet high, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as theſe ſtructures were, and rude as the materials may ſeem to be, of which they were formed, they were ſo cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that many of them ſtill ſubſiſt in different parts of Peru, long after every monument that might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us any idea of the domeſtic ſtate of the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican nations, has vaniſhed from the face of the earth. It was in the temples conſecrated to the Sun, and in the buildings deſtined for the reſidence of their monarchs, that the Peruvians diſplayed the utmoſt extent of their art and contrivance. The deſcriptions of them by ſome of the Spaniſh writers, who had an opportunity of contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, while, in ſome meaſure, entire, might have appeared highly exaggerated, if the ruins which ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main did not vouch the truth of their relations.</p>
