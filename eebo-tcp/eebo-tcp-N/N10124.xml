            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>And ſince <hi>ſuch an opportunity</hi> is now afforded, for diſcourſing, in the audience of a <hi>poor crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> under a ſentence of death, which is this day to be executed on him, and to ſuch a large aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly collected on this occaſion; it is judged to be ſuitable and right to <hi>accept</hi> of it; however affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, irkſom and painful it may be to the perſon who is now called to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012862_0004_0F8B6E20C7F3B4A0"/>With diffidence to myſelf therefore, and with a due concern of mind about a right and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable diſcharge of the duty, which at preſent falls to my lot, it muſt be adviſable to implore, and rely on, the aid and aſſiſtance of that divine Lord, that <hi>ſtrong Redeemer, who gives power to the feeble and to the weak encreaſes ſtrength,</hi> that he would graciouſly uphold in this ſervice and carry well through it; and at the ſame time it muſt be deſired, that all, who are <hi>piouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed</hi> in this aſſembly, would <hi>agree and unite in their good wiſhes and prayers,</hi> that <hi>divine ſuccours</hi> may be given in our diſcourſing and <hi>a divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> and bleſſing may accompany and follow it.</p>
            <p>The paſſage, choſen for the ſubject of our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe, and apprehended to be as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite as any other to ſuch an occaſion as the preſent, was uttered <hi>by him, into whoſe lips grace was poured, and who ſpake as never man ſpake</hi>: He is now to be conſidered as being in the place, where he had <hi>his education</hi>: For it is written in the context, v. 16. <hi>And he came to</hi> Nazareth, <hi>where he was brought up</hi>: for, though he was born at <hi>Bethlehem</hi>; he had his education at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> And <hi>as his cuſtom was, he went</hi> there <hi>into the ſynagogue on the ſabbath day.</hi> So then altho' our bleſſed Saviour was <hi>Lord of the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi>; it was however <hi>his cuſtom to keep it.</hi> And why then ſhould any of us think it unfit and improper to ſpend <hi>one day in a week</hi> in holy reſt and religious worſhip according to <hi>his example,</hi> and <hi>to his honour</hi> as our maker and redeemer? Our Lord then, <hi>according to his cuſtom on the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012862_0005_0F8B6E24620EDB58"/>
ſabbath day went into the ſynagogue</hi>; i. e. the houſe ſet apart for <hi>public prayers,</hi> and for reading, expounding and hearing the word of God: And, being at meeting at the proper time for it, he <hi>ſtood up to read.</hi> Such honour did the ſon of God put on <hi>the holy ſcriptures</hi>: He choſe to take the book, and read his text out of it, rather than to deliver one of his own: And juſt as he is about to read his text out of it, he riſes up in a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner towards it: And ſuch <hi>like reſpect does the word of God juſtly deſerve from thoſe, who preach, and thoſe who hear it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, when our Lord ſtood up to read, it follows, in the beginning of the 17. v. <hi>there was delivered to him the book of the prophet</hi> Eſaias. In order to your underſtanding of which, we would obſerve to you, <hi>that a jewiſh ſynagogue</hi> had <hi>ten perſons,</hi> who had the management of its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; among whom one of them was called the <hi>Chazan, and the angel, of the ſynagogue, or aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>; and he was properly <hi>the overſeer</hi> of it; to whom it belonged on the ſabbath day to call forth <hi>ſeven perſons; five</hi> of which were uſually common <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſuch as he thought fit, to read ſome portion out of the ſacred volume. And it is very probable, that even in this way, by <hi>the angel of the</hi> ſynagogue, our Saviour was furniſhed with a proper occaſion of declaring the truth. Well! The book of the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was by the overſeer of the ſynagogue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to our Saviour. <hi>And he opened the book</hi>; or as the <hi>greek</hi> more properly ſignifies, <hi>unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012862_0006_0F8B6E286DAEE2A0"/>
the roll</hi>; as, when <hi>he had done reading, he cloſed the book,</hi> i. e. <hi>he rolled up the roll</hi>: From which it evidently appears, that the books of thoſe days were in the form of <hi>rolls.</hi> But now our bleſſed Saviour, having <hi>unfurled the roll</hi>; behold, as divine providence ordered it, the LXI<hi>ſt.</hi> chapter of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s prophecies ſtrikes his eye, wherein is a celebrated prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf.</p>
            <p>Some indeed have inſiſted on it, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy quoted in v. 18 and 19th, under our view, was literally and punctually fulfilled with reſpect to the prophet Iſaiah himſelf: And it muſt indeed be acknowledged, that every ſentence of it might be accommodated to him.</p>
            <p>But, behold, a greater than Iſaiah is here: We have here the infallible teſtimony of our Saviour himſelf, that this whole paſſage refers to him and was fulfilled in him.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not now particularly illuſtrate all the parts of this prophecy, as belonging to our Saviour and accompliſhed by him: But we ſhall confine ourſelves to the <hi>particular clauſe,</hi> which has been read in your hearing; from which it appears, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was not only ſent to <hi>preach healing, but</hi> to <hi>communicate it to broken hearts</hi>: For, ſays he in the prophecy of him, he hath <hi>ſent me to heal the broken hearted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here therefore we have two important and moſt intereſting things preſented to our ſerious conſideration and earneſt heeding at this time.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The character of our divine Redeemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:012862_0007_0F8B6E29FB7EF8E8"/>
which is <hi>that of a phyſician, or healer of ſouls</hi>;</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The deſcription of thoſe,</hi> to whom he will approve and manifeſt himſelf to be <hi>a divine heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>: And <hi>theſe</hi> are <hi>the broken in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us begin then with conſidering <hi>the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and excellent character of our</hi> divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: And this is <hi>that of a phyſician, or heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is declared in the prophecy concerning him, and alſo from him, <hi>he hath ſent me to heal</hi>; and, in the following context, v. 21, we find, that <hi>he began to ſay to them, this day is this ſcripture ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in your ears.</hi> So then he was at that time <hi>accompliſhing the buſineſs for which he was ſent</hi> of his father: He was performing the part of a <hi>ſpiritual phyſician,</hi> and <hi>a healer of thoſe, who were broken in heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But not only in the prophecy, quoted in our text, but alſo in other prophecies of the old teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament: he is characterized as <hi>a glorious healer.</hi> And indeed he is moſt juſtly characterized in this manner. He therefore ſpeaks of himſelf as <hi>a phyſician</hi> in Matth. 9.12. Where <hi>ſinners,</hi> ſenſible of their ſpiritual indiſpoſition, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as <hi>the ſick</hi>; and CHRIST is intended and meant as <hi>the phyſician of thoſe, that are ſick</hi> in a ſpiritual ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And now, for the clearing and confirming it, that <hi>he is in truth and reality the healer of ſouls</hi>; we would propoſe the following things to your conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:012862_0008_0F8B6E2A9AD9CF50"/>Firſt of all; <hi>He is ſuch a healer with regard to his</hi> divine nature: for it is he, that is to be underſtood as ſaying, in Exod. 15.26. I Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, that healeth thee; in the Hebrew it is <hi>Repheka,</hi> i. e. thy phyſician. And indeed he not only heals the diſeaſes of <hi>natural Egypt,</hi> if they come upon his people; but he <hi>heals the ſouls,</hi> which are afflicted with the diſtempers of <hi>ſpiritual Egypt, ſuch as blindneſs of mind and hardneſs of heart</hi> and the like maladies: For in truth when the <hi>hearts of any are ſick and wounded, can any but he,</hi> who is the wiſeſt and beſt phyſician, <hi>heal them</hi>? it is therefore ſung to his perpetual praiſe and glory, as in Pſalm 147.3. <hi>He,</hi> i. e. Jehovah, <hi>healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds</hi>; in which words our divine Lord is compared to a <hi>ſkilful ſurgeon,</hi> as well as a phyſician; for he is herein repreſented not only as <hi>binding up the wounds</hi> of human ſouls, but as applying <hi>healing medicines to them.</hi> Thus the ſon of the higheſt as having <hi>the divine eſſence or nature</hi> in him, is <hi>the healer of ſouls</hi>: Nor indeed, had he not <hi>the divine nature</hi> in him, could he have <hi>healed one, that was broken in heart.</hi> As therefore it was very fitly enquired in Mark 11.7. <hi>Who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins but God only?</hi> ſo we may with the like fitneſs and propriety ſay, <hi>who can heal hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſouls but God only?</hi> now it is our Saviour God, who, by his divine influence and help, <hi>is the phyſician and healer of the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then; not only <hi>as God,</hi> but <hi>as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012862_0009_0F8B6E2B42A67780"/>
alſo, is he the healer of human ſouls.</hi> As he is thus by office a <hi>ſpiritual healer,</hi> ſo he has been divinely <hi>qualified and ſet apart</hi> for this office and buſineſs. As, under the old teſtament diſpenſation, they, who were <hi>ſeparated</hi> unto ſome ſpecial work and buſineſs by the divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were <hi>anointed</hi> for it; ſo their <hi>prieſts and their kings were anointed</hi> to their reſpective of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: Thus alſo our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is <hi>above all others the anointed of the Lord</hi>: hence the name of <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtos</hi> in Greek is given to him; each of which words properly ſignifieth <hi>anointed.</hi> Not that Chriſt was anointed with any <hi>material oil</hi>; as the prieſts and kings were under the old teſtament diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: but he was anointed with <hi>a ſpiritual oil:</hi> For it was <hi>the ſpirit of the Lord, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him</hi>; with reſpect <hi>to his humanity</hi>: and, in conſequence hereof, it appears, that he was divinely <hi>repleniſhed with gifts and graces</hi>: and hence he is ſaid, in our text and context; <hi>to be ſent of GOD.</hi> Which implies and intimates, as that <hi>he was qualified for the buſineſs</hi>; ſo that he was <hi>called and ſent forth to the office and work</hi> of a phyſician and healer of ſouls. And indeed <hi>the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would not truſt the ſouls of the human race in any other hands but his: For he certainly knew, when he <hi>put them all into the hands of his ſon,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, that <hi>he had put them into moſt able, ſkilful and faithful hands</hi>; and that none of them, who would come to him for help
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012862_0010_0F8B6E2C38CDCF20"/>
and healing, ſhould miſcarry; or <hi>be plucked out of his</hi> healing <hi>hands.</hi> It is on the account of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entruſted with this office of a Mediator, that he is ſaid to be the <hi>great ſhepherd and biſhop, as well as a phyſician of ſouls</hi>: And hence he is ſaid to be <hi>the Saviour of the world.</hi> Not that he is a <hi>mere temporal Saviour,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> vainly imagined that he would be; and as they even to this day vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expect him to be. But he <hi>is a ſpiritual heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Saviour</hi>; a Saviour of immortal ſouls: When they are <hi>infected and wounded by ſin,</hi> he <hi>healeth</hi> them, <hi>and ſaveth them from death.</hi> It is as <hi>the mediator,</hi> and <hi>the only mediator</hi> for the ſouls of men, that he affords relief againſt every ſpiritual malady. As their ſouls are <hi>darkned and full of ignorance</hi> with regard to things ſpiritual and divine; the ſon of God, as a <hi>prophet,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves and helps that malady. As they are <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> alienated from GOD and obnoxious to his diſpleaſure; <hi>Chriſt, as a prieſt,</hi> delivers them from that wretchedneſs. And the ſouls, which are <hi>under the power of ſin and other ſpiritual enemies, Chriſt Jeſus the Lord</hi> reſcues; and he <hi>ſubdues all thoſe enemies,</hi> which would otherwiſe have <hi>proved their ruin.</hi> It is obſervable, that, in our text and context, there is a reference had to the <hi>threefold office of our divine Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> It ſeems here to refer to his <hi>prophetic office,</hi> that he is ſaid <hi>to preach the goſpel to the poor.</hi> It ſeems to refer to his <hi>prieſtly office</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he is deſcribed as <hi>affording relief</hi> to the ſinners, who are broken in heart: And, when he is ſaid to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012862_0011_0F8B6E2CD36C0008"/>
afford <hi>deliverance to the captives, and the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſight to the blind,</hi> that, is to ſinners, <hi>whoſe eyes are put out</hi>; it intends and ſignifies, that God by his <hi>mighty power</hi> delivers them from this wretchedneſs and miſery, and that by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>his royal office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, have we conſidered and ſhewed, <hi>how our Lord Jeſus Chriſt as poſſeſſed of a nature tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divine, and in the exerciſe of his mediatory of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is the phyſician of human ſouls</hi>: And we ſhall further ſee, that <hi>he is the healer of the ſouls of men; if we conſider, what is the healing which he affords unto them.</hi> And now there are various things implied in <hi>this:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, firſt of all; <hi>Forgiveneſs of ſin</hi> is implied in this healing. As long <hi>as the guilt of ſin,</hi> yea of any one ſin, lies on the ſouls of men, <hi>they are in a morbid and hazardous ſtate</hi>: But, when this ſin is <hi>pardoned,</hi> they are <hi>recovered</hi> out of this ſtate. Now <hi>this</hi> is obtained by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Had it not been for <hi>this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord our healer,</hi> we ſhould never have had <hi>this remiſſion</hi> of our ſins: But, through him, every one, that <hi>penitently believes</hi> on him, has the <hi>free and full forgiveneſs of all his ſins.</hi> It <hi>is with</hi> regard to this, that <hi>the blood of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer will heal the ſouls of men.</hi> Nor can any other balm or medicine be ſo effectual as this: For, <hi>by his ſtripes</hi> and wounds and blood <hi>we are healed.</hi> And O! what a <hi>healing,</hi> what a bleſſed <hi>medicine</hi> indeed is it, which <hi>will produce and work a perfect cure of ſouls wounded by</hi> guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs? And then,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012862_0012_0F8B6E2D89A81778"/>
               <hi>Another</hi> thing implied in this <hi>healing</hi> is the <hi>renewing and ſanctifying of men's ſouls.</hi> As the <hi>ſouls of men are wounded and made ſick by the guilt of ſin</hi> lying upon them; ſo they are <hi>by the filth and impurity of ſin: That</hi> therefore, which is contrary to this and removes it, reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores the ſoul and makes it well. Now this is renewing and ſanctifying grace, which cauſes the ſoul to recover from its impurity. The beginning of this healing is, when any ſouls, by the converting grace of God, are made new creatures: For it is this grace, which healeth human ſouls: And, the more of this grace any have within them, the greater and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat is the cure produced in their ſouls. And now this healing is from Chriſt: As he is full of grace, as well as truth; he is made alſo of God unto other's ſanctification: And he thus healeth them. His word indeed, his goſpel, is the inſtrument of the divine healing, which he affords to human ſouls; and <hi>this</hi> has a virtue divinely healing in it: But the grand efficient of renewing and ſanctifying is the ſpirit of our living and powerful Redeemer. As he is the ſpirit of grace, all healing virtue proceeds from him: He quickneth and reſtores the feeble and languiſhing ſouls. And ſome of theſe, that have been ſick, and even nigh unto death, have by the ſpirit of our glorious Lord been brought to life and health again: For, as theſe ſouls within us quicken and actuate our bodies, ſo the ſpirit of Chriſt quickens and actuates hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſouls; and by this, they are recovered and healed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:012862_0013_0F8B6E2E45468A48"/>And further; the conſolation of human ſouls is implied in this healing of them. The ſouls, which are ſad, very diſtreſſed and quite diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate are ſaid to be ſick, to be wounded, to be brought low. Surely then, they muſt be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and healed by the affording of conſolation to them: And hence indeed we read, of the reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of comforts, as in Iſaiah 57.18. And now this is a ſpecial thing intended in the text: For to heal the broken hearted is to reſtore comfort to them. And now our divine healer Jeſus Chriſt is the great author of this comfort. And, when any have been in trouble of ſpirit, and afterwards received good comfort, this relief and comfort has been from the Redeemer, who has poured his wine and oil into their wounded ſouls. But it is by the ſpirit of Chriſt, that this effect alſo is wrought: For this ſpirit is not only a ſanctifier, but a comforter alſo: And it is by his ſprinkling the virtue of the Redeemer's blood, that he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the ſouls of his people to be comforted and eaſy. And beſides, it is by the word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that he communicates comfort, which is healing to their ſouls. Suppoſing their ſouls be ever ſo diſconſolate; yet a divine promiſe adminiſtred will as a cordial revive it: And the ſouls which were before drooping and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate, will be preſently thus reſtored. But now it is the ſpirit of Chriſt, who makes the word of the goſpel to become effectual, who applies the precious promiſes thereof to their conſolation and healing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:012862_0014_0F8B6E305A8B1AE0"/>Thus far we have been conſidering the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of our divine Redeemer, as the phyſician, or healer, of human ſouls; and ſhewing the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects and inſtances, wherein He appears to have been, and ſtill to be, deſerving of that charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And we are now</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, to conſider the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here given of thoſe, to whom he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and manifeſt himſelf to be ſuch a divine healer. And theſe are the broken in Heart.</p>
            <p>There are then ſome, who are broken in heart: And theſe are the people, to whom which our Lord diſcovers and manifeſts himſelf as a healer.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place then; we ſhall endeavour to ſhew you, who they be, that anſwer to the deſcription of the broken hearted: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we ſhall attempt to ſhew you the Redeemer as healing them.</p>
            <p>The broken hearted then are to be firſt known by us: And who are they, to whom this deſcription belongs? Now theſe are ſuch as follow:</p>
            <p>Firſt of all; ſuch as are grievouſly afflicted. There are ſome afflictive things, which ſuch poor frail creatures as we are cannot well bear: Inſtead of holding up, our <hi>hearts</hi> give way and <hi>ſuccumb</hi>; they ſink and fail under the weight and burden of them. Such heart breaking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are <hi>bitter reproaches and calumnies.</hi> And ſuch alſo are <hi>grievous diſtempers and pains of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which render life very uncomfortable. So
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012862_0015_0F8B6E30867749E8"/>
when any <hi>are deprived of their eſtate, and of their liberty,</hi> and for many years they are <hi>deprived of opportunities for the worſhip of the moſt high with his people</hi>; as was the caſe of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>; it muſt than be a time of grievous affliction to them, and breaking to their hearts. And when any are afflicted with <hi>ſpiritual temptations,</hi> they uſually find <hi>theſe</hi> to be <hi>heart breaking</hi> things to them: And when they are thus buffeted, and <hi>their ſpirits</hi> by ſuch means <hi>are broken and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> within them; they then are in vaſt need of divine healing; nor can they ſubſiſt unleſs <hi>this</hi> be afforded from above unto them.</p>
            <p>Again; <hi>A deep ſenſe of ſin,</hi> and hence of <hi>the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpleaſure and wrath due for it, cauſes to be broken hearted.</hi> This will cauſe the moſt ſtubborn ſinner with the moſt <hi>obdurate</hi> heart, to give way. <hi>His heart</hi> will ſtart and <hi>break</hi> before it. And indeed what heart is there ſo ſtrong and ſo ſtout, but muſt ſink and <hi>break</hi> under ſuch an inſupportable burden? <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Now <hi>a ſpirit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed</hi> with the <hi>ſenſe of its own guiltineſs</hi> before God and awakened with the ſenſe of the divine diſpleaſure and indignation, and the effects of the ſame due for ſin, is ſuch a wounded ſpirit. And <hi>what pain</hi> in the world is ſo great! <hi>What torment ſo exquiſite as from a heart thus broken?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And further; The hearts of men are broken moſt advantageouſly with the perception and ſenſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy: And verily that heart muſt be hard as a rock, and ſtronger than an adamant, <hi>which love and mercy divine will not break.</hi> Even the baſe and obdurate <hi>heart</hi> of a <hi>Saul</hi> began to break at the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012862_0016_0F8B6E3146CCC4B8"/>
clear view and perception of the mercy and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his injured ſon in law <hi>David.</hi> But how much more <hi>may the hearts</hi> of well-diſpoſed people break under a proper ſenſe of the mercy of God in Chriſt our Lord? It was this ſenſe of the divine mercy through the Mediator in forgiving her many and great ſins, which <hi>broke the heart</hi> of the penitent <hi>Mary</hi>; and, from her <hi>broken heart,</hi> proceeded her penitential tears and the other expreſſions and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of her love and gratitude to her gracious Lord. We readily grant that a ſenſe of the divine diſpleaſure may diſturb and ſhock, and in ſome degree break <hi>the heart</hi>; but yet it will not <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally break it,</hi> ſo as to prepare it for <hi>healing</hi>: No! It muſt be a ſenſe of divine <hi>mercy</hi> in Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying and following it, which will produce this ſalutary <hi>effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But having thus ſhewed you <hi>the broken-hearted</hi>; we are now, in the next place, to conſider the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer <hi>as healing them</hi>: Which indeed is the very deſign and end for which he was ſent of his Father: For ſays he, in the prophecy, and by our text alſo, <hi>he hath ſent me to heal the broken hearted.</hi> When the hearts of the ſinful children of men then are properly and thoroughly <hi>broken,</hi> then the great and good Phyſician of ſouls will heal them. Indeed the breaking of their hearts itſelf may be ſaid to be owing to him. And as he is able to break a ſtony heart, and he accordingly does it; ſo he can <hi>cure</hi> the ſtony heart, when it is broken: The ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and powerful hand, which is able to wound and <hi>break the heart,</hi> can bind it up and heal it.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>broken hearted</hi> ſinners themſelves, they perceive their need of Chriſt, as the Phyſician of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012862_0017_0F8B6E320253FA50"/>
their ſouls: And, while they who account themſelves righteous, and who are not ſenſible of their <hi>wounds</hi> and <hi>indiſpoſitions,</hi> will not ſeek to the divine Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, theſe will ſeek and <hi>cry earneſtly</hi> to him for help and healing: For, while <hi>the whole,</hi> or thoſe who fancy themſelves ſo, <hi>have no need of a divine phyſician,</hi> or imagine that they have not any need of one; the ſick, the ſpiritually indiſpoſed and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and who know themſelves to be ſo, will apply to the heavenly Healer. So the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> of old, who was ſenſible of his being bitten by a <hi>fiery ſerpent,</hi> and of the pain and anguiſh ariſing from it, knew how to <hi>prize the brazen ſerpent,</hi> and <hi>looked anxious and agonizing towards it,</hi> and ſo <hi>obtained healing</hi>: For, Sirs, <hi>the Lord is nigh to them that are of a broken heart,</hi> i. e. he is nigh to help and heal them; <hi>and ſaveth ſuch as be of a contrite ſpirit,</hi> as in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 34.18: And as being <hi>near to help,</hi> and powerful and gracious to ſave; doubtleſs <hi>he will help and ſave all</hi> that <hi>weary and labouring come to him and rely on his ability and gracious readineſs</hi> to help and ſave them. And indeed he has <hi>promiſed that he will do ſo.</hi> So then <hi>this promiſe</hi> belongs to all <hi>broken-hearted ſinners.</hi> There is a <hi>promiſe of grace</hi> to ſuch to help them in their times of need. And there is <hi>a promiſe of a free and full pardon</hi> made to ſuch ſinners, and of right therefore belonging to them. And beſides, <hi>Conſolation ſtrong</hi> and divine is engaged to ſuch; and it <hi>ſhall ſurely be fulfilled unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it is, that <hi>our divine Redeemer healeth the broken hearted: He healeth them</hi> by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012862_0018_0F8B6E32C7BB4B38"/>
on them the bleſſings which <hi>he has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed</hi> for them, and which he has <hi>promiſed to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>:</hi> And, as <hi>this</hi> was the purpoſe and end, <hi>for which he was ſent</hi> of his divine Father into the world; ſo he continues ſtill to accompliſh and gain this divine purpoſe and end.</p>
            <p>But, having offered theſe things for clearing, <hi>illuſtrating, and confirming the heads of diſcourſe</hi> propoſed to our conſideration from the text, we may now <hi>reflect</hi> in ſome ſuitable manner from the whole. Here then,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Firſt</hi> place, <hi>we ſee what is the ſickneſs and indiſpoſition of human ſouls: It is the ſin</hi> which is within them: And <hi>this</hi> cauſes the ſouls of men to ſtand in need of <hi>healing.</hi> And had it not been for <hi>this,</hi> the human race would have <hi>had no need of a divine Phyſician. Sin,</hi> therefore, is to be conſidered as <hi>a diſeaſe</hi>: And <hi>this does to human ſouls, as ſickneſs</hi> does to human bodies: It <hi>enervates them,</hi> and <hi>cauſes a Proſtration of ſtrength</hi> within them: And, <hi>by this</hi> they are rendered <hi>ſo infirm and feeble</hi> that they <hi>cannot walk, nor</hi> ſcarcely <hi>take a ſtep</hi> in the way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happineſs. And as <hi>ſickneſs</hi> uſes gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to end in death; ſo it is as to <hi>the diſeaſe of the heart and ſoul</hi>: It is <hi>in its own nature</hi> and tendency <hi>deadly</hi>: And it will prove fatal, if there be not a <hi>timely application and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of proper remedies</hi>: If there be not <hi>this, the end</hi> of the ſpiritual indiſpoſition <hi>will be death.</hi> But whoever <hi>converteth a ſinner from the error of his way will ſave his ſoul from death, and will hide a multitude of ſins,</hi> as it is written
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012862_0019_0F8B6E3388EFB458"/>
in <hi>Jam.</hi> v. 20. But,</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Second</hi> Place, What will then become of theſe ſinners, who are <hi>not broken hearted, but are of hard and impenitent hearts?</hi> As they want <hi>healing,</hi> ſo <hi>they will die without it:</hi> For <hi>die they muſt, if they be not divinely healed.</hi> We do not read CHRIST <hi>was ſent to heal</hi> thoſe laboring of that <hi>hardneſs of heart,</hi> which is contrary to <hi>brokenneſs of heart</hi>: Wherefore CHRIST <hi>will not heal ſuch.</hi> And how indeed ſhould he heal the wounds of their ſouls, who are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſenſible that they have any? And alaſs! how many of theſe are there, and that even in places <hi>of evangelical light and liberty!</hi> Though <hi>the word of</hi> GOD <hi>is like a hammer,</hi> a ponderous hammer, which breaks the rock in pieces; yet it cannot break their hearts: Though they have heard diſcourſes of judgments divine, and of ſalvation and mercy by Jeſus Chriſt; They continue unhumbled, unbroken to this very day. Nor yet will the divine diſpenſations, whether merciful or afflictive, <hi>break their hearts</hi>: No! like <hi>Pharoah,</hi> they harden their hearts under all the divine dealings. And how many are there, who do not properly mourn and grieve for their ſins of heart and life? But they continue with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and pleaſure in their evil habits and ways; and they even make a ſport and <hi>mock</hi> at <hi>ſin,</hi> and take delight in the iniquities of others as well as their own. Now is Chriſt <hi>ſent to heal</hi> ſuch as theſe, who wilfully remain impenitent; or does he any where ſay, that he will recover them, who go on with hardneſs of heart in their
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012862_0020_0F8B6E3596530AC8"/>
treſpaſſes? No indeed: But He has pronounced a <hi>woe</hi> againſt them; ſaying as in Luk. 11.25. <hi>Wo unto you that laugh now: For you ſhall mourn and weep.</hi> Wherefore,</p>
            <p>In the third place; Let us all ſeriouſly inquire and examine within ourſelves, whether we are yet ſuch <hi>broken hearted</hi> ones as our divine Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian will heal? We readily imagine, that one and all of us are willing to be <hi>healed</hi> by Chriſt; that is to ſay, we are willing to have our <hi>ſins for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given</hi> and our ſouls <hi>eternally ſaved</hi>: But the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, whether, by <hi>brokenneſs of heart,</hi> we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for theſe bleſſings and entitled to them? Say then is moral <hi>evil,</hi> or <hi>ſin</hi> become diſtaſteful and grievous to us; and is it our greateſt burden? Do we cry out under the preſſure of it, <hi>O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I am! who will deliver me from it?</hi> And have we a becoming bitterneſs and agony of ſoul within us for all our iniquities and abominations? If we have ſo, we may then comfortably hope and expect, that he will <hi>heal us,</hi> and give reſt and comfort to our ſouls. And ſay further; are our <hi>wills broken and ſubdued</hi> to the divine will? Are we happily brought to yield to our gracious God and Saviour, to ſubject ourſelves entirely to him and ſay without any reſerve at all to him, <hi>O my Lord and my God, what wouldeſt thou have me to do,</hi> or <hi>to undergo for thee?</hi> And caſting ourſelves down at his feet, and lying proſtrate there, can we acquieſce in his diſpoſal, and yet expreſs our expectations of mercy and grace from him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Here I am, O Lord, before thee; be unto me even as thou wilt: Let the Lord of all do with
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012862_0021_0F8B6E35F2A2B908"/>
with me as ſeemeth good in his ſight:</hi> But yet, <hi>O glorious Lord, my hope is in thee; and all my expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is alone from thee, who art mighty to ſave, and gracious to help, in the time of need</hi> and anxiety. Moreover, let it be enquired, are our hearts not only <hi>broken</hi> for ſin, but alſo <hi>broken</hi> off from it? Have we, with <hi>broken hearts and contrite ſpirits,</hi> both confeſſed and forſaken all our ſins, of heart and life, of fleſh and ſpirit? And have we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured in all fit ways, and to the utmoſt of our power, to make reſtitution for the damages and wrongs which we have done to others by our faults and iniquities? For, my hearers this day of all degrees, of all ages, and of all conditions, we muſt recommend it to your conſideration and your remembrance for good, that ſo much <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs</hi> and <hi>contrition</hi> of heart and ſoul as this is neceſſary for us all in order to prepare us for <hi>divine healing</hi>: Nor may we otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect pardon and happineſs through the Mediator: For without a thorough coverſion, we cannot obtain and enjoy theſe bleſſings.</p>
            <p>But here, as it muſt be expected, it may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be allowed, to uſe a more particular and pointed addreſs to the poor young Priſoner, here before the Lord, who is appointed to death for aggravated crimes, and muſt this day ſuffer it from the hands of the civil Magiſtrate, who is a revenger for anger againſt ſuch as practiſe evil.</p>
            <p>It is enough to affect us all in common with grief, and how much more ſorrowful then muſt it be to his afflicted relatives and friends, whom we heartily pity, and with whom we weep, that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012862_0022_0F8B6E3687EC9850"/>
he ſhould ſo ſoon engage, and faſt proceed, and ſo rapidly hurry on in the paths of folly and vice to his own deſtruction and ruin.</p>
            <p>But ah! poor young man, what ſpecial cauſe have you now to mourn at the laſt for your own paſt conduct and the ſad effect of it, and to ſay in the bitterneſs of your ſoul, <hi>how have I hated inſtruction, and my heart deſpiſed reproof, and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that inſtructed me! For I was almoſt in all evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now you ſee the truth of the ſacred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is found to be awfully verified concerning you, <hi>He that being often reproved, hardneth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy,</hi> as in Prov. 29.1, For behold as you have not only been <hi>ſtiffening your neck,</hi> but <hi>hardening your heart</hi> in your evil ways, you now find the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious conſequence of it: For having been wicked overmuch, you are now doom'd to die before your time.</p>
            <p>But the great concern, which you are now to have upon your anxious mind, is, how after a ſhort life too much ſpent in idleneſs, folly, vice and wickednſs, you may die ſafely and happily; and it is, we hope, your ſollicitous enquiry, <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have now been hearing of that ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſin and brokenneſs of heart for it, which is proper and neceſſary, in order to prepare for <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine healing</hi> and perfect and eternal happineſs. But now, have you yet a due ſenſe of your ſins and a becoming brokenneſs of ſpirit for them
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012862_0023_0F8B6E3739F382A0"/>
within you? Is your ſoul become deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and abaſed, and thoroughly contrite before God, as for thoſe faults and crimes, which bring you to a diſgraceful and untimely end; ſo for all your other iniquities and crimes? And is your heart thus broken and contrite for all the ſins and tranſgreſſions committed by you, not only as hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the community and fatal to yourſelf, but as contrary to the <hi>holy and good God,</hi> and oppoſite to his will and glory in the world? And abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelf in the preſence of the divine Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for <hi>all</hi> your evil choices and ways, are you at length brought to <hi>weep bitterly</hi> for them and to <hi>repent as in duſt and aſhes?</hi> While you have been bound in fetters and holden as in cords of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has God our Saviour ſhewed you your <hi>work and your tranſgreſſion, wherein you have exceeded?</hi> Has he opened your ear to diſcipline, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you in a perſuaſive and overcoming way <hi>to return from all iniquity?</hi> And is your heart now not only contrite for all your faults and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but broken off from all your iniquities? For the divine directions and commands are, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Caſt away from you all your tranſgreſſions, whereby you have tranſgreſſed; and make you a new heart and a new ſpirit: For why will you die?</hi> And it is your immediate duty and intereſt to comply with theſe things, <hi>leaſt iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould prove your utter ruin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now therefore lift up your heart and ſoul in humble and importunate prayers to the Son of God and Saviour of a loſt world, ſaying, <hi>O Lord, be merciful to me, and heal my ſoul; for I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:012862_0024_0F8B6E38022B1D60"/>
againſt thee.</hi> And ſince our divine Lord now ſay to you from the excellent glory by his word, as he ſometimes ſaid to his patients in the days of his reſidence on earth, <hi>What would you that I ſhould do unto you?</hi> Therefore, now, and for the ſhort time you have to live in the world, let it be your heart's deſire and prayer, O great and good God and Saviour, grant me, a <hi>brokenheart and contrite ſpirit</hi>; and ſhew me that thou doſt not deſpiſe it, by giving it an entire and <hi>perfect healing</hi>: Thou art <hi>mighty to ſave</hi> and can'ſt <hi>ſave me unto the uttermoſt: Save me,</hi> then, O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, <hi>or I periſh</hi>: O Lord, I beſeech thee to deliver my whole ſelf, my ſpirit, ſoul and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, from every pollution, which I have contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by wicked practices, and from all my guilt: Grant that I may be accepted in the beloved Son of God, and ſanctified throughout by the holy Spirit of God: For, <hi>without holineſs</hi> and without <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> and acceptance through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>I cannot ſee the Lord,</hi> but muſt periſh in <hi>my ſins</hi>: Wherefore, O Father of mercies, and God of all grace, cauſe thou me to <hi>turn and live</hi>: Graciouſly afford me the qualifications requiſite for pardon, peace and happineſs, a <hi>broken heart</hi> and a renewed nature; and grant me the free and full forgiveneſs of all my neglects and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the juſtification of life through the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and mediation of Chriſt Jeſus the righteous; and according to the riches of his grace, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit myſelf into thine all-powerful and gracious hands, O almighty Saviour: Lord Jeſus, <hi>receive my ſpirit</hi> at its departure: <hi>Lord remember me in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012862_0025_0F8B6E395923E5D8"/>
thy kingdom</hi>; and, as another <hi>penitent thief,</hi> admit me to paradiſe.</p>
            <p>Thus cry earneſtly to our God and Saviour for his healing and ſaving mercy: And it is our hearty wiſh and prayer for you, that God our Saviour and healer, would hear you in the day of trouble, and keep and ſtrengthen you from his ſanctuary, and grant you according to thoſe wiſhes, which we would have in your heart, and earneſtly offered to Heaven by you: God be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rciful to you, <hi>young man,</hi> and prepare you for his healing and ſaving bleſſings, and confer them on you, to the glory of his grace, and your comfort and rejoicing, Amen!</p>
            <p>But we have not yet done: We muſt finiſh our preſent diſcourſe, by ſuitably exhorting and counſelling this whole aſſembly, in the <hi>laſt</hi> place; Hearken then our dear children and young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and all of you of every age, condition, and character, now before the Lord, that God may hearken unto you.</p>
            <p>If then you love your own ſouls, and really deſire their ſpiritual health and welfare, and eternal happineſs, now at the call and invitation of the Son of God, and the great Saviour of men, repair to him for complete healing, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and eternal happineſs: Do it now, we ſay, for, <hi>behold now is the time of acceptance, behold now is the day of ſalvation!</hi> And therefore <hi>to-day hear the voice of the</hi> LORD; <hi>and harden not any longer your hearts.</hi>

of her maſter, <hi>Naaman,</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> ſaid to her miſtreſs, as we may find in 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 5.3. <hi>Would God that my Lord were with the Prophet, that is in</hi> Samaria: <hi>For he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him,</hi> &amp;c. And we would in like manner wiſh and urge, that ſinners of all ſorts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plections, who are broken-hearted, would apply to the great Prophet, as well as Prieſt and King of God's anointing: For he would recover and heal them: He is for certain a perfectly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and powerful Phyſician: He is therefore ſkilful and able to heal and ſave all who rightly apply to him. And, as he is a perfectly good and gracious Phyſician, he is therefore as will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he is able, to heal and reſtore all bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, diſeaſed, and infirm ſouls, that are ſenſible of their want of him.</p>
            <p>Other Phyſicians, and even they who have the cure of ſouls, with regard to diſtempered minds and hearts, are comparatively of no value and quite inſignificant: For, however well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, knowing, and able they may be, they cannot heal diſeaſed ſouls, and cure their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wounds. It is therefore in vain to depend on them for reſtored ſouls and ſpiritual health.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ceaſing from men, even while improving them, as it is our duty to be, we are to repair and addreſs ourſelves to him, who <hi>has the words of eternal life,</hi> the words of perfect healing and everlaſting happineſs: For <hi>to whom elſe ſhould we go but unto him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us all then, with broken hearts, look and cry to him, and rely on him for his heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and ſaving mercies; and that with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial inclination and firm purpoſe to follow all his directions and counſels, in order to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining forgiveneſs and ſalvation from him: And, if ſome of theſe counſels appear hard, <hi>as to pluck out a right eye and cut off a right hand and caſt them away</hi> from us, and to <hi>reſtore what we have wrongfully taken away</hi> from others, as far as it is in our power to do it; yet we ought to comply with them, in order to our obtaining pardon and happineſs.</p>
            <p>It may not be amiſs here, but very proper and ſeaſonable, to put a momentous queſtion to any inconſiderate, vain, and impenitent perſon that may be in this aſſembly: If then you own yourſelf a human creature and a reaſonable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let me demand of you, and let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious heart, in the fear of God, give anſwer: Is it not better to part with every ſin, and even that which is moſt dear and pleaſing to you, for Chriſt and to gain healing and happineſs by him? Is it not vaſtly, yea infinitely, better for you to be renewed and pardoned, and ſo to have your ſoul ſaved from ſin and wrath, and to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and forever bleſſed, then to continue in vice and retain your luſts, and to periſh forever?</p>
            <p>Seriouſly and impartially weigh theſe things both now, and when you return to your own homes: And immediately reſolve and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, in the divine ſtrength, moſt earneſtly ſought and moſt ſedulouſly and faithfully improved, to addreſs yourſelf to Chriſt, and give up yourſelf entirely and forever to him, as your Teacher,

Lord and Saviour, with a full and hearty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to abhor and forſake all iniquity in heart and life, and to conform to his will and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he has taught and required us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This, this is the preſcribed way, and the approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed method to be healed and ſaved to the uttermoſt</hi> by him; <hi>in whom,</hi> and from whom <hi>alone is complete health and perfect happineſs: For there is no other name given under heaven among men, whereby we muſt be</hi> healed and <hi>ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And unto him, therefore, who is <hi>the Lord our healer and Saviour, be all the glory</hi> of purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and procuring, of applying, perfecting and eſtabliſhing complete health and happineſs to the children of men, both now and forever.</p>

            <head>The LIFE, LAST WORDS, and DYING SPEECH of LEVI AMES, Who was executed at <hi>Boſton,</hi> on Thurſday Afternoon, <date>the Twenty-firſt day of <hi>October,</hi> 1773,</date> for Burglary. Taken from his own mouth, and publiſhed at his deſire, as a ſolemn warning to all, more particularly young people. <hi>There is a way that ſeemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</hi> Prov. 14.12.</head>
            <p>I LEVI AMES, aged twenty-one years, was born in <hi>Groton,</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> of a credible family: My father's name was <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Ames,</hi> who died when I was but two years old. I am the firſt of the family who was ever diſgraced. My prevailing ſin, and that for which I am ſoon to ſuffer death, was <hi>Thieving</hi>; to practice which I began early, and purſued it conſtantly, except at certain intervals, when my conſcience made me uneaſy, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do ſo no more.</p>
            <p>My firſt thefts were ſmall. I began this awful practice by ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a couple of eggs, then a jack-knife, after that ſome chalk. But being detected and reproved for the crime, I thought to repent and reform; but found myſelf powerfully urged to repeat this wickedneſs, by the temptations of the devil, with which I again complied. My tender mother ſeeing me take to ſuch horrid courſes, and dreading the conſequences, often entreated and pleaded with me to turn from my evil ways, and I as often aſſured her that I would. Had I followed her good advice and council, I ſhould never have come to this ſhameful and untimely end. But I am now made to feel the anger of GOD againſt me, for my diſobedience to my parent! GOD will not let diſobedient children paſs unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>Having got from under my mother's eye, I ſtill went on in my old way of ſtealing; and not being permitted to live with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I choſe to live with, I ran away from my maſter, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a wide door to temptation, and helped on my ruin; for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent in temper, and having no honeſt way of ſupporting myſelf, I robbed others of their property.</p>
            <p>About this time I ſtole a gun at <hi>Woburn,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Joſiah Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and a large ſilver ſpoon from one Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> of the ſame town. I then broke open the ſhop of Mr. <hi>Edward Hammond,</hi> in the county of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and took out a piece of broad-cloth and ſome money. I ſtole between twenty and thirty dollars from another perſon, whoſe name I have forgot. I broke open the ſhop of Mr. <hi>Jonas Cutler,</hi> of <hi>Groton,</hi> and took from him a good piece of broad-cloth, a quantity of ſilk mitts, and ſeveral pieces of ſilk handkerchiefs. I alſo ſtole a quantity of money from <hi>Jonathan Hammond,</hi> of <hi>Waltham,</hi> and a hat from <hi>Jonas Dix,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of the ſame place; and when in goal at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> I ſtole a ſilver ſpoon which was brought from Mr. <hi>Braddiſh</hi>'s, the goal-keeper, for me to eat with. I robbed the Rev. Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> of <hi>Lexington,</hi> of a tankard, twelve tea-ſpoons, one large ditto, a pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-box, and two pair of ſugar tongs. I alſo ſtole from Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> at <hi>Natick,</hi> two coats and jackets, with which I dreſſed myſelf when I came to <hi>Boſton</hi>; I gave <hi>John Battle</hi> twenty dollars to make up the matter with Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> being part of the money I ſtole from
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012862_0030_0F8B6E3D42B94018"/>
Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> of <hi>Waltham.</hi> I ſtole ten or eleven dollars from Mr <hi>Symonds,</hi> of <hi>Lexington,</hi> whoſe ſon-in-law, Mr. <hi>Meriam,</hi> while I was in priſon, informed me where the money was and how to get it, but he never received any of it; I ſuppoſed he gave me this information through envy againſt his father-in-law, through whoſe means he was then confined for debt. I ſtole a pair of ſilver buckles, and a pair of turned pumps out of a pair of ſaddle bags at <hi>Leaſon</hi>'s ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in <hi>Waltham</hi>; the buckles were marked I. D. which I deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a man at <hi>Marlborough</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a blackſmith, to make up with him for ſome ſtockings I took from him; his name I do not remember. I twiſted a padlock and entered the cellar of a Miniſter's houſe at <hi>Marlborough,</hi> I then went up the cellar ſtairs, lighted a candle in order to get ſome victuals. I have ſeveral times taken ſundry arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles off of lines, hedges, fences, buſhes, apple-trees, graſs, &amp;c. but cannot recollect the owners. <hi>Thomas Cook</hi> and I ſtole two great-coats and ſold them. I have left three ſhirts and ſeveral pair of ſtockings at <hi>Scipio Burnam</hi>'s, at <hi>Newbury-Port</hi>: I then went by the name of <hi>Iſaac Lawrence.</hi> I ſtole an ax out of a cart and hid it in a ſtone wall between <hi>Watertown</hi> and <hi>Boſton,</hi> (the night before I took the money from Mr. <hi>Hammond</hi>) in <hi>Little Cambridge,</hi> near to Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s tavern; there I left it with a deſign to tell it when I came back. I broke open the houſe of Mr. <hi>Rice,</hi> in <hi>Marlborough,</hi> on the Lord's-Day, while the people were gone to public worſhip, having been adviſed to it by <hi>Daniel Cook,</hi> when we were in <hi>Concord</hi> goal; was taken in the houſe, and returned the things to the owner.</p>
            <p>Some time laſt fall I ſaw <hi>Thomas Cook,</hi> who told me he had ſeven pounds of plate hid, viz. a tankard, a number of table ſpoons, and one ſoup ditto; theſe he dug up while I was with him; we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them away from that place and hid them in a ſtone wall, near a barn, cloſe to the ſign of the bull on <hi>Wrentham</hi> road, but he never informed me where he got them, or how he came by them; he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me half if I would diſpoſe of them, but I was afraid to do it.</p>
            <p>Laſt <hi>June</hi> an Iriſhman who called his name <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> of middle ſtatute, much marked with the ſmall-pox, told me that he know of a watch which was taken from his Excellency ſome time ago, and I ſuſpected that he was the perſon who ſtole it, becauſe he ſaid he knew the Governor's houſe well: He alſo aſſured me that his Excellency had a conſiderable quantity of money in the houſe, and aſked me to go with him to get it. I denied, knowing that the Governor had many ſervants, which I urged as a reaſon why I would not join him. He ſaid he had one to aſſiſt him, whoſe name he would not tell me, unleſs I would be one of the party. He farther declared that he ſhould go well armed with ſwords and piſtols. Upon this I abſolutely refuſed, becauſe I never thought of murdering any man, in the midſt of all my ſcene of thieving. He thought to prevail on me by telling me that there was a cheſt of dollars in the houſe but I would not go with them.</p>
            <p>In the ſame month (June) I lodged at a tavern in <hi>Killingſley</hi> or <hi>Pomfree,</hi> in <hi>Connecticut</hi> government, on the Lord's-day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where I <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and drank and went off without paying. A few evenings af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012862_0031_0F8B6E40357B8740"/>
I returned, ſhoved up the window, and put in my hand and ſtole a box with a johannes, ſome ſmall change, a pair of knee buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and ſleeve buttons, for which I was apprehended, confeſſed the fact, returned the goods, was puniſhed and ſet at liberty. The ſame night as above I took a horſe out of <hi>Killingſley,</hi> and rode him down to the county of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where I broke open a ſhop about day light, and took a quantity of coppers and a remnant of ſattin: The owners have got them again. I alſo robbed a baker at <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> of a quantity of coppers which I found in three baſkets, and ſpent them.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Atwood,</hi> in company with whom I committed that theft for which I am ſoon to die, my acquaintance with him began in the following manner: I was ſtanding at a countryman's cart in the market at <hi>Boſton,</hi> aſking the price of a turkey; <hi>Atwood</hi> came up to me, and we fell into converſation; he aſked me to walk with him to beacon-hill, which I did. We aſked each other about the place of reſort. I told him I lodged at Capt. <hi>Dickey</hi>'s. He ſaid his money was all ſpent, except one copper which he had in a ſnuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box. I aſked him where he belonged? He ſaid he was born in an iſland in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> and that his parents lived in <hi>Rhode-Iſland.</hi> I aſked him where he had been? He told me he lately came from <hi>Portſmouth.</hi> I told him that ſince he had no money, if he would go with me to my lodgings, I would give him ſome dinner. I aſked him what he would do with ſome ſilver plate, if he had any to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of? He told me he knew of a gold-ſmith who would take it, becauſe he had ſold ſome to him before. I told him I knew where there was ſome, and if he would go with me, we would get it; to which he conſented. We then went to <hi>Menotomy,</hi> and found it hid in a ſtone wall. We kept it about us until next morning. He told me he knew of a vendue-maſter in <hi>Boſton,</hi> with whom he had lived, who had a large ſum of money by him, and if I would join him we would get it. I aſked who it was? he ſaid Mr. <hi>Bicker.</hi> We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly agreed to ſteal it. At night, after we had ſlept, we went to a joiner's ſhop, into which I entered and took out three chizels; we then went to Mr. <hi>Bicker</hi>'s houſe, and on the way were hailed by a watchman, to whom we anſwered, friends. Having come to Mr. <hi>Bicker</hi>'s houſe, we found a front chamber window open; we pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off our ſhoes, and <hi>Joſeph Atwood</hi> with my aſſiſtance climbed up to the window and entered the houſe, and opened the doors for me; we then went together to the deſk, which we broke open with the chizels. <hi>Atwood</hi> pulled out the firſt drawer, and ſaid there was ſmall change in it, which was all he could find. As he was going away, I pulled out another drawer, in which I found a bag of ſilver coin. After that we came out and went to fox-hill, near the powder-houſe, there we hid the plate, which we had kept in our pockets while we were at ſupper, and when we entered Mr. <hi>Bicker</hi>'s houſe. The ſmall change in ſilver which <hi>Atwood</hi> took were equally divided, though the gold which <hi>Atwood</hi> had then ſecreted I knew nothing of, nor did he ever give me any of it. Before ſunſet I ſaw him at Mr. <hi>Bell</hi>'s, when he informed me that a warrant was out for me; he went with me to <hi>Winiſimit,</hi> and adviſed me to go over the ferry, promiſing to

meet me at <hi>Portſmouth</hi> the Wedneſday following at the houſe to which he was taken. I returned again to <hi>Boſton</hi> to ſee if any of my cloaths were done which I had beſpoke; on Saturday I was taken by Mr. <hi>Bicker</hi> and committed to goal, and ſaw <hi>Atwood</hi> no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I ſaw him in the priſon-yard after he was apprehended.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given an account of that ſhocking manner in which I have filled up a ſhort life, and of which I am now aſhamed. May GOD forgive me my dreadful wickedneſs, committed both againſt him, and many worthy men, of whom alſo I would aſk forgiveneſs, it being not in my power to make reſtitution, which if it was I would readily do it. I alſo forgive from my heart <hi>Joſeph Atwood,</hi> who ſwore on my trial that I entered the houſe of Mr. <hi>Bicker</hi> firſt, and let him in, when he knows in his conſcience that he entered firſt and let me in. I die in charity with all mankind. But though I lived ſuch a wicked life it was not without ſome ſevere checks of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. For after I had ſtolen, I have been ſo diſtreſſed at times, as to be obliged to go back and throw the ſtolen goods at the door, or into the yard, that the owners might have them again. And not long before I was taken for this laſt robbery, I paſſed the gallows on <hi>Boſton</hi> neck with ſome ſtolen goods under my arm; when my conſcience ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly ſmote me, and I thought I ſhould ſurely die there, if I did not leave off this courſe of life. What I then feared is now come upon me.</p>
            <p>Having thus given an account of my dreadful life of wickedneſs, I would alſo mention the manner in which I have conducted, and my mind has been exerciſed during my confinement in goal, ſince the awful ſentence of DEATH was paſſed upon me.</p>
            <p>At firſt I had ſecret hopes of eſcape; that I ſhould by ſome means get out of priſon. When I ſaw it was impoſſible, I endeavored to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile myſelf as well as I could. My conſcience made me uneaſy; I thought I had been ſo wicked that I ſhould certainly go to hell. And when I conſidered how ſhort my time was, I knew I could not do good works to go to heaven. To hell then I was ſure I ſhould go. And I ſeemed to have ſuch an awful ſight of hell and the grave, that I was very much terrified indeed; I then took to drinking ſtrong liquor an order to drown my ſorrow. But this would not do; I left that off and took to reading my bible; my conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo uneaſy, that I could have no reſt. O! a wounded conſcience who can bear? I tried to pray; but it came into my mind that the prayers of the wicked would not be heard. Yet I could not help crying for mercy. I was at times ready to deſpair of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD. But the miniſters who viſited me, aſſured me that the blood of CHRIST was ſufficient to cleanſe me from all ſin, which gave me a little encouragement to go on crying to GOD. I now began to underſtand ſomething of that law of GOD which I had broken, at condemning me for the wickedneſs of my heart as well as life. I ſaw that I was undone, that my heart and life were bad beyond all account. I ſaw that if GOD ſhould damn me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times he would be juſt, and I ſhould have nothing to ſay. In this condition I was a week before the time fixed for my execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The loſs of body and ſoul made me tremble; though I could not freely tell all that I felt to all who came to ſee me. I
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:012862_0033_0F8B6E41D461F8C8"/>
thought that if I ſhould be executed in this condition, I muſt be dragged like a bullock to the ſlaughter.</p>
            <p>But GOD's name be bleſſed forever; that on Friday evening, the 8th inſtant, I turned over a little book which was put into my hands, in which I ſaw, Ezek. 36.26, 27. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put upon you: And I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you a heart of fleſh. And I will pour out my ſpirit upon you,</hi> &amp;c. This at once ſurprized me: I knew that I wanted this new heart, and could not help looking on this as GOD's gracious promiſe to me: And I thought that as I knew GOD could not lie, if I would not believe this, I would believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: My mind at once felt eaſy. I now ſaw that I had ſinned againſt GOD all my life with as much envy, as ever I killed a ſnake; which I always hated.</p>
            <p>After this I had, and now have ſuch a view of the way of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by CHRIST, that I felt and do feel my ſoul reſt on him as my only hope of ſalvation. Since which I have found peace of mind, anger againſt myſelf for ſin, and a deſire to be made holy. At times the terrors of death ſeem to be removed; at other times I am full of fears leſt I ſhould deceive myſelf. Yet I cannot but hope that CHRIST has freely pardoned me. On him I deſire to reſt liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dying; and to give him all the praiſe.</p>
            <p>And now as a dying man I mention the following things, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To keep your doors and windows ſhut on evenings, and ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well to prevent temptation. And by no means to uſe ſmall locks on the outſide, one of which I have twiſted with eaſe when tempted to ſteal. Alſo not to leave linnen or clothes out at night, which have often proved a ſnare to me. Travellers I adviſe to ſecure their faddle bags, boots. &amp;c. in the chambers where they lodge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Parents and maſters I entreat you who have any concern for, and connection with children, to have an eye over their actions, and to take ſpecial care for their precious and immortal ſouls.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All Perſons whether old or young, who may ſee theſe lines, ſpoke as it were by a poor, dying ſinful man, now bound in chains, and who has but a ſhort ſpace of time before he muſt launch into an endleſs eternity; guard againſt every temptation to ſin. If at any time you are tempted to do any thing like the poor ſoul who now ſpeaks to you, earneſtly pray to GOD for ſtrength to reſiſt the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as well as for repentance for your paſt ſins.</p>
            <p>The youth more eſpecially I would ſolemnly caution againſt the vices to which they are moſt inclined—Such as <hi>bad woman,</hi> who have undone many, and by whom I alſo have ſuffered much; the unlawful intercouſe with them I have found by ſad experience, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to almoſt every ſin. I alſo warn them to guard againſt the firſt temptation to <hi>diſobedience to parents.</hi> Had I regarded the many kind intreaties and reproofs of my tender Mother, I had never come to this ſhameful and untimely death.</p>
            <p>Profane <hi>curſing and ſwearing</hi> I alſo bear my dying teſtimony againſt, as a horrid ſin, and provoking to GOD.</p>
            <p>Nor muſt I omit to mention <hi>gaming,</hi> to which young people are much inclined, and which at this day prevails to the ruin of many.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012862_0034_0F8B6E43E97A1678"/>
For when a youth hath gamed away all his money, he well be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted even to ſteal from his maſter or parents, in order to get at it again. Beſides, this ſin leads to <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> another dreadful vice.</p>
            <p>There is one ſin more that I muſt warn all perſons againſt, and that is, <hi>a profanation of the Lord's day, and of public worſhip.</hi> Oh! how many ſuch days have I deſpiſed, and while others have been engaged in ſerving GOD, I have been employed in wickedneſs, which I now confeſs with grief of heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I have one requeſt more to make from the borders of the grave, a compliance with which is earneſtly deſired by a poor dying mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; which is, that no perſon, old or young, would ever reflect on my poor dear mother, or brother, or any of my relations, on account of my ſhameful and untimely death, who could not prevent my wickedneſs, and have trouble too much to be borne, by the life I have lived, and the death I am to die.</p>
            <p>I deſire ſincerely to thank all the good Miniſters of the town, who have taken great pains with me ever ſince the ſentence of death was paſt upon me, to convince me of my unhappy ſituation, of my loſt and undone condition by nature, of my aggravating ſins by prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and of the infinitely free rich grace and mercy of God, only thro' the merits and mediation of my dear Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. I alſo thank all the good people both of town and country, who, I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think, have offered up many prayers at the throne of grace for me. I alſo thank Mr. <hi>Otis,</hi> the goal-keeper and his family, who have all been very kind to me during my confinement in goal. LA MES.</p>
            <p>☞ <hi>Ames</hi> was attended to the place of execution by the rev. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Stillman,</hi> one of the baptiſt-miniſters in this town, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly viſited and prayed with him while he was under confinement, and ſpared no pains to reform and bring him to a juſt ſenſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy condition and guilt; in ſhort, ſuch was the aſſiduity of that reverend and pious Gentleman, that his utmoſt efforts were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, to ſit and prepare him for a future <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: So great affection and concern did he ſhew for the future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of this unfortunate young creature, that while he was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying him to the fatal tree, with tears in his eyes, he claſped this young convert round his waiſt, and ſeemed to take the greateſt ſatisfaction in converſing with him about the things that concerned his everlaſting happineſs; to ſum up the whole in a few words, his whole deportment, in his agreeable moments ſpent in his travel, ſeemed to beſpeak, <hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you.</hi> The Priſoner was turned off juſt at four o'clock, having firſt given a ſhort but pathetic exhortation to the vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people, who attended this awful ſcene, ſuppoſed to conſiſt of ſeven or eight thouſand perſons, and particularly the YOUTH, who he earneſtly entreated to avoid <hi>Stealing,</hi> the crime which he was moſt addicted to, and for which he was to ſuffer an ignominious death. He took by the hand Mr. <hi>Edward Ranger,</hi> houſewright, (a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Mr. <hi>Stillman's</hi> church) and returned him and Mrs. <hi>Ranger</hi> thanks for their kindneſs to him. After which he made a ſhort prayer, and ſeemed to die a true penitent, without ſcarce a ſtruggle.</p>
