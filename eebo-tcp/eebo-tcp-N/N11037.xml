            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IN the feweſt words I can poſſibly uſe (for I will not waſte many upon you, who are as callous as your tyrannic maſter) I moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily congratulate your Lordſhip upon the honourable retreat of your unnatural and ſavage mercenaries under the command of your bully, Col. Smith. I am told your maſter laughs at the event; you, who know him, know to which of his amiable qualities we are to impute this heroic merriment; whether to his brutality, his ſtupidity, or hypocriſy. Let him remember, and do you tremble, when I tell your Lordſhip, that neither of thoſe qualities will avail him in the field, however they may be flattered in his ſycophantic circle at a fawning levee.</p>
               <p>In the ſubſequent part of this paper, I have given a true reaſon for the early prorogation of your ſmuggled parliament. I have told how much your Lordſhip and your miniſterial gang feared the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of news from Boſton, during the ſitting of parliament.</p>
               <p>But why has your Lordſhip ſtopped the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:013987_0002_0F9259B562332850"/>of this pleaſing news in your Gazette? Why do you wait for the arrival of the Sukey? With what deluſive lye do you intend to cheat the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who, even in this kingdom, are upon the eve of taking arms? I tell your Lordſhip, peremptorily, that they will do ſo. Though I know, that neither you, nor any of your impolitic, bloody herd, from the maſter butcher, down to his loweſt ſlaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, can relent, yet in the name of the people of England, I charge you all to deſiſt.</p>
               <p>Forewarned, forearmed, my Lord, you have now, moſt traiterouſly opened a ſcene of CIVIL WAR in America; let me conjure you not to riſque one here. Turn over the annals of that weak tyrant Charles the firſt? lay them fairly (in ſpite of Bute and Mansfield) before your deluded, infatuated ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, dare to be honeſt in this dreadful CRISIS, do not, like a coward, conſult your own ſafety, but your country's. Let Bute and Mansfield periſh; and, if there is a blacker parricide, let him fall too; nay, rather fall yourſelf, my Lord, then lend a further hand to extinguiſh liberty in this unhappy empire.</p>
               <p>Your vain, your wicked hopes of conqueſt in America, will moſt aſſuredly prove abortive; your retreating troops, your mercenary parricides (En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland diſclaims the aſſaſſins) have drawn blood from the virtuous, the brave, the free Americans. It is the wiſh, my Lord, of every true born Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, that thoſe military hirelings (who are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland's baſtards, not her ſons; may fall a ſacrifice to the juſtice of America. Reſt aſſured, my Lord, that they will be cut to pieces before your murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reinforcement, under that neceſſitous tool Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, can poſſibly arrive.</p>

That every reinforcement for ſuch inhuman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and unjuſt purpoſes, may ſhare the ſame fate, and that ſtruggling America may at laſt be free, or, if enſlaved, that ſhe may diſdain to be enſlaved by her tyrannic parent, is the pious prayer of every virtuous Briton, and the moſt fervent wiſh of</p>

               <p>NO Prince can be more aſtoniſhed at the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupplications of injured ſubjects than I am at the ſhameful negligence of Charles Eyre and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Strahan, Printers to the King's moſt excellent Majeſty. I am ſorry to ſay, that his Majeſty's laſt ſpeech is by far the fulleſt of typographical errors of any ſince the revolution. Theſe errors will

The royal Printers are the leſs excuſable for want of due attention, as a royal ſpeech is no ordinary compoſition, it originates from Bute, is trimmed up by Mansfield, adopted by North, and pronounced by a royal orator; but as it is at laſt ſubmitted to the inſpection of the public, it muſt, like other human compoſitions, undergo the public cenſure.</p>

As to the firm Americans, it is impoſſible that they ſhould be compriſed in theſe tender terms; becauſe his Majeſty is moſt graciouſly pleaſed to intimate, a little before that if his firm and ſteady parliament had not, with a firm and ſteady reſolution, devoted that part of his Majeſty's ſubjects to deſtruction, the rights of his crown, the authority of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the commercial intereſts of his kingdoms, could not be maintained, protected and promoted. The neceſſary inference from theſe words is, that nothing can maintain, protect, or promote, the true intereſts of the Britiſh empire, but popery, ſword, and famine, I may add tyranny, and taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the above ſugared words (<hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>beloved</hi>) are extended generally, they muſt be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as ſprings to catch woodcocks, they remind me of that ſhrew'd reflection which Shakeſpear

               <p>Q.—Whether this early prorogation is not as truly ſymtomatic of the Miniſter's fears, as the ſudden diſſolution was of the laſt infamous parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? This early prorogation (by Mansfield's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) ſhews, that after all the foul mouth'd, bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying, inſolence of a tyrannic adminiſtration, they dare not protract the ſeſſion of parliament any longer for fear of hearing news from America (which they could not conceal) during that ſeſſion. This vacation, therefore, is artfully contrived to give breath to a confuſed, diſtracted, and trembling adminiſtration; at the opening of the next ſeſſion of parliament, (if this vile adminiſtration lives ſo long) we may (under Bute and Mansfield's auſpices) expect ſome curious ſtate manoeuvre, ready cut and dryed. I will venture to propheſy with more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty than Lord Sandwich, Lord Denbig, or any other miniſterial bully in the gang, that we ſhall at laſt ſee, not a rational political gratification o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the wiſhes; but a pitiful, mean, contemptible, and daſtardly ſubmiſſion, (by downright compulſion) to the juſt demands of America. I call upon my countrymen, to remember, that ſo inſignificant an individual as Caſca, now foretells that neither the preſent adminiſtration, nor, (as I fear) the preſent reign will end till they have ſupplied matter for a dreadful and moſt exemplary record in the Britiſh annals.</p>
