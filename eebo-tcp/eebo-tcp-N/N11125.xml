            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Governor JOHNSTONE's SPEECH, UPON Lord BARRINGTON's MOTION, That 17, 547 effective Men, Officers and Invalids included, be employed for the Year 1775.</head>
            <p>I THINK, a true determination upon this queſtion can only be made after knowing the plan which the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in Adminiſtration are <hi>reſolved</hi> to purſue, with reſpect to American affairs. It is now clear, that the people of America, actuated with the ſame firm and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſpirit, and tinctured with the ſame enthuſiaſm which enabled our anceſtors to withſtand the unjuſt claims of the crown, in the days of Charles the Firſt, are determined to reſiſt the high doctrines of parliamentary ſupremacy, held forth by this country, which muſt, in its conſequences, reduce their liberties to a level with the colonies of France and Spain. If we are reſolved to adhere to thoſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible tenets, echoed with ſo much applauſe in the laſt parliament, and on the firſt day of the preſent ſeſſions, nothing but the ſword can now decide the conteſt. In that event it is in vain to ſuppoſe, that the peace eſtabliſhment of the army now propoſed will be ſufficient; for every wiſe man muſt foreſee, that our rivals in Europe cannot be idle ſpectators in ſuch ſcene. Suppoſing then, a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force is employed to ſubdue the Americans, this country muſt be left deſtitute of the neceſſary defence. No man is leſs deſirous of augmenting a military eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than myſelf. I foreſee that the liberties of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try muſt, in the end, fall a ſacrifice to that power which
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014092_0004_0F92DDE546949DB8"/>
has annihilated the rights of mankind in other ſtates. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the danger from abroad, and the danger from thoſe who are to defend us, according the preſent eſtabliſhments of Europe, the ſituation is very nice. For my own part, however wiſely the military ſyſtem is interwoven into our conſtitution in time of peace, citizen and ſoldier happily intermixing with each other in equal privileges, yet, upon an invaſion, or a civil war, when men of high minds come to aſſemble in military camps, with the weapons in their hands, the contagion of power will ſoon ſpread; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, we muſt maintain (though with a watchful eye) a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary force for defence in caſe of invaſion. I ſpeak as a ſeaman, confident, that whenever France ſhall find an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing officer, capable of conducting ſuch an attempt with ſkill and reſolution, that the landing of an army in this country, is not to be prevented by all the ſhips we can arm, while the elements continue ſo various, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſo ſhort. There are ſeveral methods to accompliſh this, which I ſhall not repeat here, from prudential mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; but I am ſo convinced of the truth of my aſſertion, that I conſider it as the duty of every man in this country to be ready to diſpute the fate of this kingdom on a battle; and if we are left without a neceſſary ſtrength to ſupport wavering minds in ſuch a conjuncture, while we are think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of depriving our fellow-citizens of their juſt and legal rights in America, we may, as a proper puniſhment, loſe our own. It is true, that, by the preſent vote, we do not preclude ourſelves from an augmentation in the courſe of the ſeſſion, in caſe the exigencies of the ſtate ſhall require it, and ſo far I am willing to aſſent to the preſent motion; but, I beg gentlemen in adminiſtration, will, in the mean time, draw no merit from propoſing ſo low an eſtabliſhment, unleſs they intend to alter their meaſures, ſince it is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly inadequate to our ſituation; and, I would likewiſe caution the landed intereſt, not to plume themſelves on the eſcape they have made, ſince it is equally evident, a further taxation, if not included in the general vote of this muſt be demanded by extraordinaries, or a vote of credit, to meet them next ſeſſion, under the multiplied expences of that mode of raiſing money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:014092_0005_0F92DDE629345AE8"/>
With regard to the navy, I confeſs it to be extremely hard, that the noble Lord ſhould be attacked in the laſt ſeſſion of parliament for too great profuſion, and blamed in this for the reduction that was then deemed neceſſary: But I am not one of thoſe who are captivated with a ſimple pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition upon paper, when all the avenues of extravagance are kept open; while the ſituation of our affairs, from the worſt judged policy, neceſſarily leads us to open theſe ſluices of expence. It is therefore in vain to hold out oeconomical reſolutions in our votes, when our conduct muſt produce a contrary effect. I hope, however, that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of gentlemen on the ſubject of American affairs begin to alter. I hope, they will now ſee what men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted by the luxurious vices of a great capital, are capable of ſuffering, in ſupport of eſſential privileges; and that the flattering expectations of <hi>ſeeing America at our feet,</hi> are now vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>To thoſe who conceive that men are to yield their rights from oppreſſion and diſtreſs, I would recall to their memory the ſufferings of the late Parliament of Paris. The haughty mind of a debauched Miniſter and an imperious Chancellor, had induced the late King of France to violate all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and eſtabliſhed priviledges of that auguſt body, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaining check againſt the deſpotiſm of the monarch: even men of wit and genius were found baſe enough to vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify the claims of the Parliament; for I am ſorry to obſerve, that fortitude of mind does not always accompany excellent talents; and that many mer poſſeſſing thoſe rare gifts, are too often induced to lend their ingenuity to the hand that pays them, in ſupport of the doctrines of the day. Is it poſſible for any of the people of America to undergo greater diſtreſs than thoſe worthy patriots in France have ſuffered? Deprived of their office and ſubſiſtance, baniſhed from their friends, vilified by the court, no proſpect of a change; yet ſupported by principle and a good conſcience, they have now ſeen their day of triumph, and felt the reward of virtue; ſecuring to their country, by their perſeverance, more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential rights than have been obtained by three civil wars. After ſuch conceſſions from the King of France, ſhall the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014092_0006_0F92DDE6CCAAFF08"/>
King of Great-Britain be aſhamed to yield to the juſt cries of two millions of his ſubjects!</p>
            <p>I know all the arguments which are uſed to entangle weak men in ſupport of the preſent arbitrary tenets. The ſubject, indeed, is complicated; and men are confounded, more than convinced. It is ſaid that legiſlation exiſting in the Parliament of Great-Britain, taxation, which is a part of legiſlation, muſt neceſſarily be included. The various privileges which ſubſiſt in every free ſtate, are hardly to be determined by any reaſoning <hi>a priore.</hi> Such dilemmas oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur on every ſubject. Can any poſition appear more ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to thoſe who maintain the doctrines of virtual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, than, that a borough ſhould ſend two members to Parliament, without houſe or inhabitant? And yet there are many who hear me, ſtrenuous advocates againſt Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican charters, that hold their feats in this Houſe under ſuch a curious repreſentation. At the ſame time, I confeſs, the baſis of the conſtitution depends on preſerving their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges entire, ſince no man can ſay how far the reform would reach; and the whole art of government conſiſts, in preſerving to every one his eſtabliſhed rights. The moſt certain ſcience we know is mathematics; yet, if I was to ſay to many men, that two lines might approach nearer and nearer to all eternity, and never could meet, they would think the aſſertion ridiculous and abſurd. Nevertheleſs, there is nothing ſo certain as the truth of that theorum. It is equally true, that legiſlation may exiſt without the power of taxation. The <hi>kingdom of Ireland,</hi> within our own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, is a proof of what theſe learned gentlemen aſſert to be ſo impoſſible. A worthy member in my eye, being preſſed with this argument in the laſt ſeſſion of Parliament, from the fairneſs of his mind, he avowed, as his opinion, <hi>that we could tax Ireland.</hi> I remember there were ſome gentlemen in the gallery when this declaration was made, whom I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perceived, by the contorſions in their countenance, to be Iriſh members: Next day the worthy member choſe to make ſome apology to his friends. He ſaid, no parallel could be drawn between Ireland and the colonies; for Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land had a <hi>paraphernalia;</hi> and this ſatisfied both the Engliſh
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014092_0007_0F92DDE786FF8CB8"/>
and Iriſh members. For my part, I do not ſee what diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty can occur, in leaving the different colonies on the ſame footing of raiſing money by requiſition, as from the people of Ireland. If it is thought this manner of raiſing ſupplies might throw too much power into the hands of the crown, that power might be limited, ſo as not to be exerted, except upon the addreſs of both Houſes of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſuch as has been lately adopted reſpecting the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in regulating the coin. I am ſtill hopeful, that the tenſe chord, on which our American creed has been ſaid and ſung, will be relaxed. I think I perceive the tone of the noble Lord is not ſo loud, or ſo lofty, as on ſome former debates on this ſubject. I hope it does not proceed from want of health, in which caſe, no man could feel more ſorrow for his Lordſhip than myſelf; but, I hope, it ariſes from a more ſerious and deep reflection on the ſubject, where his own good ſenſe has had room to operate, free from thoſe violent aſſociates, who ſeem to have precipitated his Lordſhip into ſuch raſh and cruel meaſures, contrary to his own natural good temper. Here then, I ſhall conclude, as I ſet out, hoping, that generous, juſt, pacific meaſures will be adopted; but ſtill inſiſting, that no man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine properly on the number of forces to be employed, until we know the meaſures that are to be purfued reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing America</p>
            <p>[<hi>It was Mr. Righy, Maſter of the Rolls in Ireland, who bad declared that the Parliament of Great-Britain had a right to tax Ireland in all caſes whatever, as well as America.</hi>]</p>
            <div>
               <head>MR. CRUGER.</head>
               <p>I Riſe, Sir, to ſay a few words on this important ſubject, with all the diffidence and awe which muſt ſtrike the mind, on a firſt attempt to ſpeak before ſo auguſt an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Had I remained ſilent on this occaſion, I muſt have condemned myſelf for ſeeming to deſert a cauſe which I think it my duty to eſpouſe. I cannot but be heard with candour by Engliſhmen, when what I offer is dictated by a love to my country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:014092_0008_0F92DDE859257830"/>
I am far from approving all the proceedings in America. Many of their meaſures have been a diſhonour to their cauſe. Their rights might have been aſſerted without violence, and their claims ſtated with temper as well as firmneſs. But permit me to ſay, Sir, that if they have erred, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a failing of human nature. A people animated with a love of liberty, and alarmed with apprehenſions of its being in danger, will unavoidably run into exceſſes: the hiſtory of mankind declares it in every page; and Britons ought to view, with an eye of tenderneſs, acts of imprudence, to which their fellow-ſubjects in America may have been hurried, not, as has been unkindly ſaid, by a rebellious ſpirit, but by that generous ſpirit of freedom, which has often led their own anceſtors into indiſcretions.</p>
               <p>Acts of ſeverity are far from having a tendency to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate jealouſies; on the contrary, they muſt produce new fears, and endanger that attachment and obedience which kindneſs and gentleneſs might have inſured.</p>
               <p>No country has been more happy in its colonies than Great-Britain. Connected by mutual intereſts (till the aera of the fatal ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>p act) they flouriſhed in an intercourſe of amity, protection and obedience, ſupporting and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by each other. Before than hated period, we meet with no inſtances of diſobedience to your laws; no denial of the juriſdiction of Parliament; no marks of jealouſy and diſcontent. They ever loved liberty; their zeal for it is coeval with their firſt emigration to America. They were preſecuted for it in this country; they ſought a ſanctuary in the unexplored regions of that. They cleared their inhoſpitable w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>You protected them in their infant ſtate, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned it, by conſining to you the benefits of their trade. You regulated their commerce for the advantages of this country, and they never diſcovered an oppoſition, either to the authority or the exerciſe of it. Are theſe evidences of a ſpirit of diſaffection to Great-Britain, or ingratitude for its protection? Are they not rather proofs, that if the ſame
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014092_0009_0F92DDEA8F9DF0A8"/>
line of mild and lenient government had been purſued, the ſame cordiality and ſubmiſſion would have been continued?</p>
               <p>Every American who loves his country muſt wiſh the proſperity of Great-Britain, and that their union may ever ſubſiſt uninterrupted. If the paternal trunk is injured, the branches muſt ſuffer with it. A ſubordination on the part of the colonies is eſſential to this union. I acknowledge, Sir, that there muſt exiſt a power ſomewhere to ſuperintend and regulate the movements of the whole, for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preſervation of our common happineſs; this ſupreme power can be juſtly and adequately exerciſed only by the legiſlature of Great-Britain. In this doctrine the colonies tacitly acquieſced, and were happy: England en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by it all the advantages of an excluſive trade. Why then ſtrain this authority ſo much, as to render a ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to it impoſſible, without a ſurrender of thoſe liberites which are moſt valuable in civil ſociety; and were ever acknowledged the birthright of Engliſhment? When Great-Britain derives from her colonies the moſt ample ſupplies of wealth by her commerce, is it not abſurd to cloſe up thoſe channels, for the ſake of a claim of oppoſing taxes, which (though a young member) I will dare to ſay, never have, and probably never will defray the expence of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting them?</p>
               <p>The expediency of coercive meaſures is much inſiſted on by ſome, who, I am ſorry to ſay, ſeem to conſider more the diſtreſſes into which they will involve the Americans, than the benefits they can procure from ſuch vindictive conduct to this country. Humanity, however, will prompt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mind to weep over ſeverities, though they may be even neceſſary; and a prudent ſtateſman will reflect, that the colonies cannot ſuffer without injury to Great-Britain. They are your cuſtomers—they conſume you manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;—by diſtreſſing them, if you do not drive them to foreign markets, you will moſt aſſuredly diſable them from taking your commodities, and from making you returns for what they have taken.</p>
               <p>Should coercive meaſures reduce them to an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the equity of parliamentary taxation, what are the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014092_0010_0F92DDEACFCF9798"/>
advantages which will reſult from it? Can it be thought that the Americans will be dragooned into a conviction of this right? Will ſeverities increaſe their affection, and make them more deſirous of a connection with, and dependence on, Great-Britain? Is it not, on the contrary, reaſonable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the effect will be an increaſe of jealouſy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content; that they will ſeek all occaſions of evading laws impoſed on them by violence; that they will be reſtleſs under the yoke, and think themſelves happy in an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of flying to the protection of any other power, from the ſubjection of a mother, whom they conſider cruel and vindictive?</p>
               <p>I would not be underſtood, Sir, to deny the good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of adminiſtration. The abilities of the Miniſter, it ſeems are univerſally acknowledged; but I muſt add, <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum eſt errare.</hi> Though an American, I applaud his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy for the dignity of parliament, and think the impolicy and inexpediency of the late meaſures may reaſonably be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the difficulty of the occaſion, and the unſettled and undefined nature of the dependance of the colonies on the mother country; and <hi>vice verſa,</hi> candour muſt admit the ſame apology for the violences and miſtakes of America.</p>
               <p>But ſince theſe meaſures have been found, by ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, totally inadequate; ſince they have widened the breach, inſtead of cloſing it; diminiſhed the obedience of the colonies, inſtead of confirming it; increaſed the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and oppoſition, inſtead of allaying them; it may be hoped, that a different plan of conduct will be purſued, and ſome firm and liberal conſtitution adopted, by the wiſdom of this houſe, which may ſecure the coloniſts in their liberties, while it maintains the juſt ſupremacy of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>HE ſaid, though intereſted as he was in the buſineſs before the Houſe, he ſhould have remained ſilent, had be not conceived that an honourable gentleman * had thrown ſome undeſerved reflections on the Americans, which he ſhould take ſome notice of before he ſat down, but that he choſe firſt to pay a little attention to the general buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He obſerved, that the diſpute between this country and her colonies was of ſuch infinite importance to both, that he hoped he ſhould be forgiven if he ſaid it would be imprudent to enter into it, but with the utmoſt caution and deliberating; that we were now like men walking on the brink of a precipice; that there was danger in every ſtep, and that in his opinion the ſalvation of this country depended on the meaſures that were adopted by the houſe this night. He then apprized the houſe, that the ſettlement of the unhappy diſputes between England and America did not particularly concern any ſet of men, whether in or out of adminiſtration; that it related to all, was connected with all, and materially affected the intereſts of the whole ſtate. He then ſtrongly recommended to all parties to go into an examination of the queſtion, free from reſentment or prejudice; to conſider it with impartiality, to diſcuſs it with temper, and to adopt with unanimity and ſalutary propoſition, regardleſs of the man or party that may ſuggeſt it. He then endeavoured to vindicate the Americans, both as to their courage and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, (in oppoſition to the aſſertions of the colonel;) the latter he did with much good humour and pleaſantry, but loſt his temper in the former, became perſonal, and was called to order. He concluded with ſaying, that as many ſchemes of accommodation were talked of, he earneſtly wiſhed that ſome one might be adopted which would tend to reſtore the harmony any affection that once ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Great-Britain and her colonies, and produced ſo many invaluable bleſſings to both.</p>

               <head>Governor JOHNSTONE's MOTION for recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment of the Addreſs.</head>
               <p>BEFORE you pronounce this dreadful ſentence upon a meritorious, ſober, and induſtrious people, I hope the Houſe will indulge me with a few words in diſcharge of the duty I owe myſelf, and likewiſe a view of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting my character fair to poſterity, when thoſe black ſcenes ſhall be examined without prejudice.</p>
               <p>The real queſtion before us is, upon the proper meaſures to be purſued reſpecting our fellow-ſubjects in America. In order to judge of this, we muſt conſider the real cauſe of diſpute. I ſay, the ſubſtantial difference turns upon the right of taxation. Moſt of the advocates on the other ſide have endeavoured to ſlur this point, and alledge, That the claims of the Americans extend far beyond this article, and that the act of navigation itſelf is in danger.—But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for a judicious mind to read the material papers, and not ſee that this is illuſory. The Congreſs has expreſsly told us, They are willing to acquieſce in thoſe laws which ſecure to us the monopoly of their trade, as neceſſary in the mutual connection;—and the inſtructions from Philadelphia, on which the proceedings of the Congreſs are chiefly formed, avow theſe doctrines in more full and explicit terms. This method of condemning men by inference and conjecture, contrary to their repeated declarations. I cannot approve; I ſhall therefore bend the whole force of my argument to the original cauſe of quarrel,—taxation.</p>
               <p>The great and only ſecret yet found out, for preſerving the liberties of mankind from the incroachments of that power which is neceſſary for the executive in large king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, is the power of the purſe. This was the ſubject of contention in the civil wars of Charles the Firſt. It is this privilege alone which makes the Houſe of Commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable: this is the point which Hampden obtained for us! And I leave every one acquainted with the hiſtory of thoſe memorable times, to determine in his own mind, "Whether we ſhould ever have enjoyed this bleſſing, if
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014092_0013_0F92DDECCEFB8688"/>
he had tamely paid the tax, and had not reſiſted?"—From, this power we derive the certainty of aſſembling the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people; by this redreſs of grievances may precede ſupplies; and the ſecurity that the exerciſe will not be abuſed is derived from hence, that the Houſe cannot impoſe on others what they are not to feel themſelves. By the principles of the conſtitution, every man ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The more he ſhall burthen America, the more he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himſelf. Judge Hobart ſays, "If an act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was made conſtituting a man a judge in his own cauſe, it would be void by the law of nature." Yet ſuch is the preciſe ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uation in which we contend we ought to be placed, reſpecting the Americans, and for the denial of which we are ready to condemn our fellow-ſubjects to all the tortures enacted by the laws of treaſon.</p>
               <p>Let us look round, and view the fate of different ſtates that have yielded or preſerved the privileges for which the Americans contend. So ſoon as the cortes loſt this power, their ſlavery was complete. Portugal has now no veſtige of this Palladium—Here is tyranny ſupreme! In France, where the traces are left, (as in the <hi>pays d'etat,</hi>) their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is diſtinguiſhable from the miſery of other parts. In Britain we are yet free, becauſe we retain it. In Holland, Switzerland, and the other ſtates of Europe, they are more or leſs ſo as they preſerve it.</p>
               <p>What are the circumſtances that diſtinguiſh and protect the Britiſh colonies from thoſe of other nations? The repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people met in general aſſembly and the trial by jury.—It the ſyſtem of taxation by the Parliament of Great-Britain, takes place, what being can be ſo credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as to expect the Aſſembles of the people will ever
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014092_0014_0F92DDED924BAF70"/>
meet; and it is confeſſed, that Admiralty Courts, diſclaiming trials by jury, are neceſſary to enforce this ſpecies of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Here then are all the eſſential privileges of an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman dependent on this queſtion, and the real intereſt of the ſtate is no way concerned in the contrary ſcale, ſince the proſperity of the colonies muſt ever prove the riches and glory of England. Nothing but the abſurd pride, or narrow ignorance of the preſent adminiſtration, can be thrown into it. When once this ſyſtem takes place, we ſhall then feel the tyranny and oppreſſion of Governors, with all their train of dependents, as in the provinces of Rome, which are now quoted as an example.</p>
               <p>Thus much, ſuppoſing the Americans right in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute (as I believe they are;) but ſuppoſing them wrong, I ſhall now ſtate their excuſe, and ſee what heart can condemn them, and retain any claims to humanity.</p>
               <p>The queſtion concerning the right to tax the colonies, though clear to thoſe who are accuſtomed to think deeply on the principles of free governments, is difficult to common apprehenſions. Monteſquieu has obſerved, "that in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotiſm every thing ought to depend on two or three ideas." As for inſtance, is there any thing ſo fit to ſolve this diſpute, as the unity of the Britiſh empire—the ſupremacy of the legiſlative authority of Great-Britain—the omnipotence of Parliament? Is there any man ſo ignorant, after having heard thoſe ſounding words, as not clearly to comprehend the whole of the controverſy? Plodding, thinking creatures, who are accuſtomed to conſider the complicated privileges in a free government, from whence the harmony of the whole ſprings may be puzzled; but men who have never diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their repoſe with ſuch dry conſiderations, can have no doubt on the matter; be that as it may, certain it is, that the diſcuſſion of this moſt important queſtion was debated in this aſſembly by the greateſt abilities, after the fulleſt informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ever accompanied any political queſtion. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was in favour of the Americans; the ſtamp-acts was repealed.—I admit that "principles of expediency" are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as the reaſon, in the preamble of the bill, but the men who boldly denied during this diſcuſſion, the power of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014092_0015_0F92DDEE50F896D8"/>
taxing the colonies, as conſtitutionally exiſting in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Great-Britain, namely, Lord Chatham and Lord Camden, (men of as extraordinary talents as ever adorned ſociety) the one was made prime miniſter, the other was created a peer, and Lord High Chancellor of Great-Britain, the keeper of the King's conſcience!—What American could have retained any doubt of his cauſe in the mind of his Majeſty, or the nation, after ſuch a deciſion? The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing act ſoon followed (for the ſake of gratifying a party) violating all the principles of commerce and policy in the lump-giving draw backs here, exacting duties there, committing the power and authority of the nation on ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which never could produce any effectual revenue, and this in a manner that all men of ſenſe muſt ever condemn.</p>
               <p>When the Americans ſaw, by this act of parliament, that the great queſtion was likely again to return upon them, in the progreſs of time, though the greedineſs, ignorance, or caprice of ſtateſmen, they met the poſition in its fly, circui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, queſtionable ſhape; they recurred to their old prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; they revolted againſt the preamble; they tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted petitions; and all failing, they entered into non-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation agreements; this produced Lord Hillſborough's circular letter, which I will repeat again, and again, till a contrary conduct is purſued; for no ſatisfactory anſwer can be given about it, while the preſent doctrines are avowed. The Americans thus fortified in their opinions concerning the point of taxation, are unanimous againſt our power, from Nova-Scotia to Georgia. If there be any doubt on this fact, why not call Governor Eden? We are told he lately arrived; it would have been becoming to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him; but I call on his relations friends, or any man, to contradict me in this aſſertion, "that the Americans are unanimous againſt this power of taxation, as lodged in the Britiſh Parliament." They are reſolved to reſiſt; and ſince you have placed them in a ſituation, where they muſt either be rebels or ſlaves, the blame muſt lie with thoſe who have drove them to this dilemma.</p>
               <p>In diſcuſſing the queſtion of reſiſtance, the gentlemen on the other ſide have great advantages. We ſtand on difficult
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014092_0016_0F92DDEF068D1408"/>
ground, ſince, from its nature, it never can be defined, or admitted as lawful. The firſt officer of the crown has fairly expreſſed my ideas on the ſubject. The principle ſhould never be extinguiſhed in any government, much leſs in a free country; the occaſion muſt ever be referred to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral feelings of mankind. Now, if depriving a trading town of its commerce—if cutting of whole ſocieties from the benefit of the element which God has given them—if proceeding to deprive them of the fiſhery, their ſubſiſtence—if altering their charter, and annihilating all their rights, without hearing them in their defence—if eſtablishing, in its ſtead, a new form of government, which leaves all things in confuſion—if erecting a ſyſtem of tyranny in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and eſtabliſhing not tolerating) all the abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Roman catholic religion—trial by jury diſmiſſed—<hi>babeas corpus</hi> denied—the repreſentatives of the people determined uſeleſs—inferior duties levied by act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—in ſhort, precedents for the violation of ever thing we hold moſt ſacred in this country: I ſay, if acts like theſe can vindicate reſiſtance, the Americans can quote them, and God and the world muſt judge between us. For my own part, I conſider, with Lord Somers, "that treaſon againſt the conſtitution is the firſt ſpecies of that crime." Acts of parliament are ſacred things, and yet they may be ſo made, grinding the face of mankind, that human nature will revolt at their ſeverity. Dudley and Empſon were hanged for acting—according to act of parliament.</p>
               <p>I have now ſtated the arguments which ſhould induce you to pauſe at leaſt before you take this irretrievable ſtep. I ſhall examine next the conſequences.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe we ſhould ſucceed in ſubduing the Americans, is it not clear from henceforward that we muſt govern them by military force? Muſt not our army be increaſed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion? While his Majeſty retains the power of moving his troops from one part of his dominions to another, can there be any ſafety for the liberties of this country? If the mortification begins at the extremities will it not ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the centre? Every man acquainted with the hiſtory of nations muſt foreſee the conſequences. If we
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014092_0017_0F92DDEFD0705BD8"/>
fail in the attempt, which is the happieſt event that can occur what difficulties may not diſguſt, irritations, and all the horrors of civil war, enge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>der? While the juſtice and moderation of this country are blotted from the face of the earth, and the accumulated expence, when the ſprings of riches are cut off, muſt ſhake public credit t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the very centre.</p>
               <p>The noble Lord has hinted, "if repealing the tea tax would do, he would yield that," and he ſpeaks even faintly on the power of taxation. If theſe are his principles, we are yet more inexcuſable. We are going to puniſh men for maintaining what we are ready to yield, and to engage the nation in endleſs expence, for the ſake of a quiddity. Since whether renounced on the principles of expediency or right, the ſatisfaction muſt be equally complete to the Americans.</p>
               <p>But the noble Lord alledges, "that yielding the point of taxation would not now do." This is conjecture on his part; but at leaſt it would produce this good effect, we ſhould divide the Americans; we ſhould unite men in this country, and go to the conteſt with better hopes of ſucceſs. The proofs the noble Lord gives for his opinion are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral indiſcreet acts of different meetings ſince the late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion in America. Such detail never affects me. I think no concluſions can be drawn from them—In all civil wars, when the people are let looſe to reaſon on government, a thouſand abſurd doctrines are broached. Let us apply this to our own country—let us remember all the ridiculous circumſtances which Hudibras has painted better than I can. But ſhould the great cauſe of liberty, in which our anceſtors were engaged, ſuffer from ſuch circumſtances? To their feelings we may truſt; on the reaſoning of the multitude there is little dependence. For my own part, I think with Cardinal De Retz, "that any number above one hundred is at beſt but a more mob." [<hi>Here the Houſe felt the expreſſion as too ſtrong.</hi>]—It never could be my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to apply the rule to this Houſe, long trained in form and diſcipline, though ſometimes there are doctrines and proceedings, eyen here, that would ſurprize a ſtranger into this belief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:014092_0018_0F92DDF08F34BEF8"/>
But the noble Lord ſays, "Why not petition firſt, and acknowledge the right, and then we will grant relief." Have they not petitioned? Is there a means of ſupplication and proteſtation they have not tried? I am convinced they went to the crown merely as a mode of introducing their petition here. Now you deny hearing their agents. An honourable gentleman in adminiſtration ſays, "he wiſhed we had heard their petitions." Do not then condemn them for not petitioning, till you have declared your reſolution to hear them. Can it be expected the Americans will act on the inuendos of a miniſter? If you mean fair, why not declare your intentions by ſome binding act? After the Eaſt-India company, who will truſt you? You invited them to petition, under hopes and declarations, and afterwards made uſe of this very petition, to deprive them both of their money and their privileges. In the ceded iſlands you invited men to ſettle under the royal proclamation, and then levied four and a half <hi>per cent.</hi> on their produce, which precedure has lately been condemned in the courts of law. In Canada you have been guilty of a greater violation, as liberty is dearer that property. Here you have deſpiſed the royal proclamation, and forfeited your engagements to mankind. I repeat it again, What man or ſociety of men can truſt you?</p>
               <p>The next objection to the Americans is the congreſs. This is now termed an illegal meeting. Government here, lay by with great expectation, waiting their reſolves. If they had been favourable to their views, or had any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward circumſtances broke their union, we ſhould have had much eulogium on the congreſs. Now they have come to reſolves favourable to the liberties of mankind, all is abuſe. I do not know by what law (except that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe) mankind can be regulated on theſe occaſions. What kind of meeting can that be called, which was held in this place at the Revolution? Aldermen and old mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of parliament mixing in conſultation. The neceſſity on theſe occaſions gives riſe to the caſe. You wiſhed to know the ſenſe of the people of America: Was ever the judgment of a people ſo fairly taken? Firſt the occaſion is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014092_0019_0F92DDF149A2B0A8"/>
promulgated: The people chuſe repreſentatives; theſe chuſe deputies; the deputies in congreſs publiſh their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, each member returns to his reſpective colony, where his conduct is again approved—No place, no pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, no bribe, to influence his election, or bias his vote. But even as to the legality, the manner of meeting is not new; government itſelf called a congreſs in the laſt war, to apportion the quotas of men and troops.</p>
               <p>One gentleman has ſaid, "that our ſituation is quite new, and there is not example in hiſtory to direct our ſteps." I ſay there is a caſe directly ſimilar, but we are too conceited to profit from ſuch experience. Philip the Second and his ſeventeen provinces are the counterpart of what we are acting. The debates in his council on ſending the Duke of Alva into the Netherlands, are applicable in every part. He was adviſed by two ſenſible men, to repair thither him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and hear the complaints of his people, before he came to ſuch raſh reſolves; but the majority ſaid, as in this caſe, that his glory was compromiſed. It was not religion only, but taxing without conſent of their ſtates, that brought matters to the laſt extremity: The Duke of Alva, it is true, was victorious every where at firſt, but his cruelties were but ſowing the ſerpent's teeth. The Gues, the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars of the Briel eſteemed at that time infinitely more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable than the New-Englandmen are repreſented, gave the firſt ſhock to the power of Spain. In comparing the probability of events, can any man ſay Great-Britain has ſuch a proſpect of victory in the conteſt, as Spain might then have expected? Yet we know the event, and how that mighty empire was rent in pieces. The preſent reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution hurries us into that ſituation, from which there is no retreating. It obliges the Americans immediately to act. By declaring them in rebellion, they muſt have recourſe to arms; all negociation is cut off.—I think the word rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion both impolitic and unjuſtifiable. I beg to know what paper on your table can vindicate that term? The firſt law officer of the crown ſaid, "A number of men committing treaſon was rebellion." I differ from him in the definition: According to my conception of the phraſe, they muſt be
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014092_0020_0F92DDF218F81700"/>
in military array, to affect ſome military purpoſe. One hundred men coining money are not in rebellion, though committing treaſon. Inſurrections to pull down incloſures is not rebellion, though deemed a conſtructive levying war. In the caſe of Purchaſe and Demerce, for pulling down the meeting-houſes, they were convicted of treaſon, but no one ever thought of ſaying the confederates or aſſociates were in rebellion. I think we ſhould be very cautious how we criminate bodies of men on ſuch intelligence. I dare ſay the noble Lord has been deceived himſelf; but this I affirm, he has hitherto conſtantly deceived this houſe. It appears to me that no intelligence from General Gage can be depended on. I beg the houſe will attend particularly to what I now ſay, before they engage their lives and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. It appears General Gage has regularly deceived ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration. No event has turned out as he foretold, or gave reaſon to hope; the next letter conſtantly contradicts the expectations raiſed in the former. He ſeems never to have known what they were about—no doubt groſsly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on himſelf—but the facts are undeniable. When he firſt arrived, he writes the malecontents were abaſhed, and the friends of government would ſoon appear. Next, his expectations from the aſſembly were diſappointed, and he diſſolves them in ſurpriſe: Then, there would be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; next, though there would be a congreſs, they would differ and diſagree: In ſhort, led on, and leading others by vain expectations, till the laſt letter, which announces a total diſaffection, and which I believe to be the true ſtate of the provinces.</p>
               <p>Singling out the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, can anſwer no purpoſe, but to expoſe our partiality. It is the cauſe of all, and the other colonies can never be ſo mean as firſt to encourage and then deſert them before the general right is ſettled.</p>
               <p>The noble Lord talks next of ſtopping their fiſheries; but he ſays, "the act is only to be temporary." Does the noble Lord think he can turn the channels of trades as eaſily as he can turn the majorities of this houſe? The explain the idea, ſuppoſing the New-England fiſheries ſtopt, their
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014092_0021_0F92DDF2E23602C8"/>
utenſils muſt waſte and deſtroy. But, will the Engliſh merchant madly increaſe his ſtock, and fit out new ſhips, if the act is merely temporary? If it is perpetual, the people in America are ruined. The conſequence is, the French muſt in the end reap the benefit of all this ſtrange policy.</p>
               <p>We are conſtantly ſtating the great obligation we have conferred on the colonies by our former behaviour towards them: If it was ever ſo good, we can claim no merit from hence in private or public concerns, to do injury in future. They do not complain of your former behaviour, but they ſay, you have altered this very ſyſtem from whence you would now derive their ſubmiſſion.</p>
               <p>There are two arguments of the noble Lord which I muſt remark upon before I ſit down; the firſt is, "the comparative view of taxation between this country and the colonies, according to the number of inhabitants." His Lordſhip ſays, "we pay about twenty-five ſhillings a head, and they pay about ſix-pence." Who is there ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with political arithmetic as not to know that the ſmall ſum people pay in taxation is often a proof of their poverty, and a large ſum a proof of their proſperity, by demonſtrating the riches from the greatneſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption? Let this kind of reaſoning be applied to Ireland and Scotland, where we know the multitude to be poor in compariſon to the inhabitants of London, whom we know to be rich; beſides, if the coloniſt does not pay in palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caſh from his own hand, does not he pay all the taxes on the four millions of manufactures he receives, and part of thoſe taxes on the raw materials he ſends hither?</p>
               <p>The other argument is ſtill more extraordinary. The noble Lord ſays. "if we fail in our attempt of forcing America, we ſhall ſtill be in the ſame ſituation we are in at preſent." What! after our armies have been diſgraced, our fellow-ſubjects deſtroyed, all the irritation of a civil war, public confidence, and fair opinion loſt? Does the noble Lord think he will be in the ſame ſituation himſelf? I really ſpeak it with regret; for perſonally I have much regard for the noble Lord, and particularly becauſe I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014092_0022_0F92DDF3A8D97D30"/>
from his faint manner of ſtating his propoſitions, that they are not the dictates of his own mind, and that they are forced on him.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſee my other memorandums, and therefore I ſhall conclude by heartily concurring with the noble Lord who moved for the recommitment of this addreſs.</p>

               <p>I Riſe up under a number of diſadvantages, and ſhall ſcarce be able to expreſs my ſentiments without much agitation and embarraſſment, a novice as I am at political diſquiſitions, and attempting, (from a ſeat which till this hour I might not call my own) to ſpeak on a ſubject of ſuch high import, in the preſence, and poſſibly againſt the opinion of the moſt experienced ſtateſmen in any country of the univerſe.—But, Sir, it has been earneſtly recommended to me, as well by the electors of the borough of which I have the honour to be a repreſentative, as by ſeveral other perſons of reſpectable conſideration, that I will exert the utmoſt of my humble endeavours and faculties, towards the eſtabliſhing of peace, and conciliating the affections of the American colonies with the parent-ſtate of Great-Britain, and to promote the joint happineſs of both diviſions of this mighty empire, on the firm baſis of equity and mutual good offices: and I ſhould hold it an unpardonable omiſſion of duty were I to remain now ſilent, eſpecially as I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, by the dependence before Parliament of a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted return, from declaring my diſpoſition towards the oppreſſed coloniſts, at the opening of the preſent ſeſſion, when a ſpeech from the throne of the moſt inimical ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to America, and therefore the moſt alarming and dangerous tendency to the whole Britiſh realm, received the thanks of this Houſe. I was under the ſame precluſion
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014092_0023_0F92DDF462998F28"/>
when commerce here ſtood a dejected ſupplicant, in juſt apprehenſion from the impending ſtorm. Well, Sir, might ſhe be alarmed, to ſee a pilot at the helm, as the winds and the billows ariſe, who, rather than part with the guns, throws the merchandize overboard: ſave them, Sir, he may, by ſo coſtly a ſacrifice, but not for jubilee or triumph; they ſhall be ſaved for ſignals of diſtreſs, and to ſolemnize the obſequies of your empire.</p>
               <p>The merchants were not then to be heard leſt their candid ſtory ſhould ſet in the proper point of view thoſe inſidious fragments of official letters laid on your table. What hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man underſtanding could cement ſuch a mangled correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence together, ſo as to derive any clear accurate knowledge of the real condition or ſentiments of the Americans?—Whatſoever might extenuate offences, excuſe error, and reſtore perfect amity between the two countries, did the partial hand of adminiſtration wickedly ſuppreſs, while in too glaring a light was exhibited every fact that could ſerve to widen the breach, and inflame the paſſions, and blow up a faint, luckleſs ſpark of animoſity to the full combuſtion and horrors of a civil war!—Theſe miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations however anſwered the ends propoſed, for both Houſes were blindly entrapped to give their ſanction to as ſanguinary a ſcroll (in the form of an addreſs) as was ever laid by a proſtitute ſenate at the feet of deluded majeſty.—Did not your anceſtors, Sir, manfully fight, did not ſome of them heroically fall, to preſerve thoſe conſtitutional Rights of the ſubject to every Briton, which you have not by one vote pledged yourſelf, at the hazard of life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſubvert and annihilate throughout the better part of the whole Britiſh monarch?</p>
               <p>I do not conceive it poſſible that any man here preſent can feel as he ought, be conſcious of a participation of the leaſt participation, in the ſuperintendence of the common-wealth, and remain a mere tranquil obſerver, when ſo weighty, ſo intereſting a ſubject comes before you; a ſubject, on the iſſue of which perhaps his own individual happineſs or miſery, doubtleſs the happineſs or miſery of his neareſt poſterity, will depend.</p>

With what hebetude, Sir, muſt the blood circulate thro' his veins! What muſt his definition be of an ignominious ſupineneſs and apathy!—This is not a debate of ſlow animation, in which few perſons are concerned, and of limited influence; we are now to decide upon the fate of millions through a long ſeries of ages, and the part which every man ſhall take on this occaſion muſt ſtamp him with characters indelible through all eternity—a patriot or a parricide.</p>
               <p>'Tis, Sir, from the colliſions of controverſy that thoſe radiant ſparks are ſtruck out by which truth lights her ſacred torch—nor have I leſs expectation from thoſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are but juſt initiated into parliamentary buſineſs, than from your veteran politicians "deep on whoſe front engraven (to uſe the phraſe of Milton) deliberation ſits and public care." Such veterans might indeed be our ſureſt guides, were we now about to agitate queſtions wrapt up in ſubdolous Machiavelian myſtery, and only to be deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped by the acuteſt abſtract reaſoning. The preſent juncture, Sir, requires only a well principled heart, and a head moderately converſant with the nature of men and things.</p>
               <p>It is not, I own, I feel, given to a young member of this auguſt aſſembly to deliver his ideas with that method, that guarded correctneſs, that unagitated confidence which long habitude of ſpeaking uſually ſupplies; but will he, Sir yield with leſs ductility to the dictates and honeſt zeal of inward conſcience? He comes among you at leaſt with a judgment unbiaſſed: he has not pledged himſelf to any partial junto, whoſe maxims and intereſts he is at all events to adopt for the meaſure of his political career: he has not ſtood forth an accomplice to any of thoſe manifold miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and blunders which have heretofore been committed in the adminiſtration of your colonies: he has had no ſhare in inflaming the evil by temporary anodynes; nor has he treated the imperial concerns of that wide-ſtretched conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent as only acceſſary to, and of trivial account when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with his own private ſchemes of ambition and ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandiſement. Upon the whole, Sir, I can but thinks him
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014092_0025_0F92DDF5C5E27070"/>
rather the more likely to execute the ſhare of ſuch impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant award committed to his diſcretion, as becomes an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right delegate of the people at large, heedleſs whether his conduct therein may quadrate with the narrow, ſelfiſh views of this or that ſet of men who are candidates for titles or power: not but that I have the ſatisfaction to ſee here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſome characters animated with the true patriotic ſpirit, who have long and worthily been ſeated within theſe walls; on whoſe eminent talents, on whoſe approved integrity, America reſts her beſt hope.</p>
               <p>Such gentlemen as come within the ſcope of any of thoſe diſadvantageous alluſions I have juſt thrown out, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that a well-timed receſſion from error claims the next praiſe to a perfect exemption therefrom; they will no longer endeavour to palliate a dreadful diſeaſe, which, if once ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at a full paroxiſm, it will baffle the Eſculapian ſkill of their experteſt ſtate-doctors to cope with.</p>
               <p>Our preſent ſagacious rulers had, it ſeems, drawn their political clue in that quarter of the globe to ſo Gordian a tie, that deſpairing to revolve by patience and ſober wiſdom through the ſeveral implications their hands had wrought, they took a ſummary recourſe to the edge of the ſword. Sir, their ſword-law will beſt agree with the arbitrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and ſyſtem of government applied to almoſt every department of the ſtate by that flagitious confederacy which hath latently preſided over the councils and arcana of the cabinet ever ſince the acceſſion of our preſent moſt gracious ſovereign.</p>
               <p>I ſay, Sir, that theſe occult dictators to the royal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhould prefer the ſword-law, I am not at all aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; but that the oſtenſible adviſer, a man of profound judgment, and the cleareſt penetration; a man whom the moſt ſlanderous of his enemies allow to poſſeſs the tendereſt feelings of ſocial affection, to be even prodigal of the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices as well as profeſſions of humanity, that he, Sir, ſhould with a ruthleſs compoſure, adopt and carry into execution their bloody mandates, may well create general conſternation and the deepeſt concern.</p>

               <p>Sir, when the two moſt renowned republics of ancient time had long contended for univerſal empire, and victory over many a well-fought field had held almoſt an equal balance then it was the rigid cenſor (M. Cato) denounced that memorable judgment, <hi>"Delenda eſt Carthago."</hi> Sir, the Carthagenians were the natural rivals of the trade and glory of Rome; they had in cool blood inhumanly put to death one of the moſt perfect heroes and patriots her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals could boaſt: in their national character they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious to a proverb; and they early led their children to the altar to liſp aſſent to ſolemn adjuration of eternal war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and vengeance againſt Rome. In ſhort, Sir, the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exiſtence of theſe Africans was become quite incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the peace and ſecurity of the Roman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</p>
               <p>The words, <hi>Delenda eſt Carthago,</hi> were, in the reign of our Charles the Second, borrowed by a member if the other Houſe of Parliament, the famous Earl of Shafteſbury, in the height of paſſionate reſentment againſt the Hollanders: but, Sir, though the Hollanders had to the moſt ſubſtantial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries added the provoking inſult of ſailing up to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porium of your commerce, with brooms at their maſt heads;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014092_0027_0F92DDF812A00D18"/>
though they had by many an inveterate combat on the ocean brought your marme power, and conſequently our very being as people, to as deſperate a criſis as ever befel Rome during the rage of the punic wars, yet, Sir, it is a well known anecdote of that day, there was ſcarce a peer in the aſſembly but ſtood aghaſt, and ſhuddered at the unchriſtian ſeverity of the ſentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Delenda eſt Carthago</hi> has been applied for the third time: it has, Sir, been recently and publicly applied, by an avowed zealous partizan of the preſent adminiſtration of your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to our fellow-ſubjects of America, and the news will, I fear, ere long, reach your colonies.</p>
               <p>I am not maſter of language ſufficient in energy to give the due comment to ſuch an expreſſion: but, Sir, ſhould it be here uttered in ſobriety, and calmly liſtened to, might you not be apt to imagine yourſelf feated amidſt the deputies of the Indian tribes, near the interior lakes of that continent, and ſacriſicing to the demon of revenge, rather than with the deputies of the free, poliſhed natives of the Britiſh iſles, in their imperial ſeat of legiſlation?</p>

               <p>I Hope the Houſe will pardon me, if I beg their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttention a few moments, and but for a few moments; for I ſhould make a very ill return to the favourable indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhewn me on a former day, if I preſumed to trouble it long on this. Uninformed, unacquainted, unexpecting a propoſition of ſo extraordinary a nature, as that laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us by the noble Lord on that day. I felf myſelf forced from a ſeat of ſilence, which perhaps would then have,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014092_0029_0F92DDF999967210"/>
and might ſtill better become me; but which I ſhould have thought, under ſuch circumſtances, it would have been ſhameful to have continued. After having maturely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the reſolution, whether, on the principles of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation with American demands, or on the principles of enforcing the authority of this country, I think it nugatory and humiliating. Does the noble Lord really think, that a people who deny all right of taxation will be ſatisfied with having the mode of taxation left to them? Does he not think, the Americans will feel themſelves as effectually put under contribution as any town or country ever yet was, in any ſtate of open war? Will he preſume to call that an amicable plan, which aſks for contribution at the mouth of your cannon and point of your bayonets? Sir, by holding out theſe terms of accommodation, ridiculous in themſelves and nugatory in their effect, by making the firſt offer to treat with thoſe men you have juſt declared rebels, you will lower the dignity of this country; you will bring your government into contempt, and, by the inſult of the offer, irritate, not appeaſe, that ſpirit which your are now about publicly to declare to the whole world you tremble to encounter. This, Sir, I am confident, is the light the Americans will ſee it in; and theſe are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples on which they are expected to accommodate.</p>
               <p>I will now, Sir, beg permiſſion of the Houſe to make a few remarks on the reſolution itſelf, and for this purpoſe I muſt beg leave to refer it. Sir, I would beg leave to aſk of the noble Lord, what conſequences he means to draw from theſe words of the reſolution, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>According to the condition, circumſtances, and ſituation of ſuch province or colony, for contributing their proportion, ſhall be approved;<g ref="char:endq">”</g> and I hope, if my queſtions ſhould not appear as pertinent to the Houſe as they do to me, it will be recollected under how many diſadvantages a young man, unacquainted with parliamentary proceedings, unacquainted with parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry language, muſt labour. Before I give my aſſent to any meaſure, I ought to inform myſelf what is meant to be founded on that meaſure, and what conſequences are meant to be drawn from it; for by theſe means alone I can judge
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:104092_0030_0F92DDFA4B4BC8E0"/>
of the propriety or impropriety of the meaſure. I do not doubt, therefore, that the noble Lord will anſwer me with as much candour, as I ſhall aſk with diffidence. Now the words I would wiſh to draw the attention of the Houſe to are theſe: <g ref="char:startq">“</g>According to the condition, circumſtances, and ſituation of ſuch province for contributing their propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall be approved.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> Sir, the queſtions I would aſk are theſe, Is this proportion to be annually offered by the colonies, and annually refuſed or accepted by Parliament? Or is it in the firſt inſtance to be ſettled for a certain period of years, or is it to be ſettled for ever?</p>
               <p>The queſtions demand a ſerious anſwer: in the firſt caſe, you perpetuate the feeds of diſcord, and lay the foundation of a diſpute that can never end, but in a total convulſion of the Britiſh empire. In the ſecond caſe, adopting a temporary expedient, you withdraw your own ſhoulders from a burthen you have no reſolution to bear, leaving the great point in diſpute as unſettled as you found it, leaving it to arise at that fixed period, whenever that period ſhall arrive, to be the cauſe of new diſturbances, new quarrels, and freſh blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. If you ſettle it for ever, do conſider what a miſerable bargain you are contending for. The Americans are ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to double in twenty years; it is but reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that their wealth and opulence will encreaſe in proportion; that, therefore, what would be a reaſonable proportion now, will, in a few years, become comparatively with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed wealth, a miſerable pittance.</p>
               <p>I muſt here take notice of an argument the noble Lord has enforced more than once, with great weight; it is, that theſe terms are ſuch as ſhould be offered, after the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete victory. For the ſake of the argument, I will agree with the noble Lord, and therefore conclude, that they are improper to offer before the victory. That, Sir, which is generoſity, which is magnanimity after victory, is timidity and foul diſgrace before it. There may be ſituations, Sir, in which ſtates may be found where they cannot, without certain ruin, acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:014092_0031_0F92DDFB06AB8500"/>
advantage. The firſt of theſe ſituations precede great commotions, the ſecond ſucceed complete victory. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Sir, the Romans, in a war they had with the Italian ſtates, granted them, when conquered, thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which, with a firmneſs peculiar to their nation, with a firmneſs that led them to univerſal empire, they haughtily refuſed them before their conteſt.</p>
               <p>I will now tell the noble Lord the effect theſe propoſitions have had on the minds of the people. I will not take upon me to ſay what confidence the people repoſed in adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before, but I will take upon me to ſay, that whatever confidence they might repoſe in adminiſtration before, it is now entirely done away; they no longer expect to find firmneſs, reſolution and unanimity in the councils of the King's ſervant, they have ſeen them weak, irreſolute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>UPON a former occaſion I preſumed to ſtate a few of my ſentiments of the Houſe, relative to the war im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over the Americans, becauſe I was ſure I could not anſwer it to my own feelings. I thought I could not anſwer it to my country, had I neglected at the very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt moment that might offer, to declare my utter abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of thoſe unconſtitutional, arbitrary, and diabolical projects, deviſed by his Majeſty's miniſters for the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin of that unhappy people.</p>
               <p>I flatter myſelf a certain illuſtrious character may ſoon be left out of this opprobious liſt of projectors; there ſeems to be a divine gleam of radiance coming round his temples; and I foreſee almoſt, if not altogether, as marvellouſ a converſion into the right path, as that which happened in days of yore to the great perſecutor of the chriſtian follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on the plains of Damaſcus.</p>
               <p>To what black ſtorm in the political firmament we are indebted for this ſudden change, I, Sir, move in too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a ſphere to diſcover; but the noble Lord will allow me to tender him my hearty congratulations, that he is at

length awakened to that clemency, and to that juſtice, which will beſt agree with the innate temper of his heart. There is a long line of ſtateſmen ſeated in firm array not far from your chair, who have, ever ſince the birth of this parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, uniformly ſhrunk (and I am ſure their conſciences always muſt ſhrink, whatſoever their politics or their elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may do) from the great American queſtion; they have wiſhed to defer to the lateſt hour poſſible, all diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this critical topic, in hopes, as they term it, to learn what is actually doing on the other ſide of the Atlantic. Sir, I can inform them, there riſes not a ſun in that hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, but ſets to ſuch additional grievances and outcries, as the moſt ſoothing future conceſſions, the moſt exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry future ſacrifices on your part, will ſcarce be able to atone for.</p>
               <p>However grating to the ears of ſome individuals the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may be, I ſhall take the liberty, with the indulgence of the Houſe, to affirm, that theſe meaſures of compelling the Americans by force of arms to acknowledge the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount and unlimited authority of parliament, in the taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their property, a property created by their faculties, and by their induſtry, are not <hi>juſt,</hi> are not <hi>politic,</hi> are not <hi>practicable,</hi> but a traiterous infringement on the conſtitution of the colonies, which reſts upon the ſame fundamental principles that uphold the property and uphold the fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes of every native of this iſland.</p>
               <p>Sir, I ever will contend, that the united parliaments of England and Scotland cannot legally impoſe a tax on the ſubjects in any other part of the Britiſh dominions, without the conſent of ſuch ſubjects, either by themſelves in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or by their repreſentatives. Let the champions of deſpotiſm avail themſelves of all their knowledge and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, I will venture to maintain this propoſition, not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogantly preſuming on my talents or ſkill to manage it, but on its own clear intrinſic merits, and the conviction that to every diſpaſſionate mind muſt naturally reſult from its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation.</p>

On <hi>this</hi> ground, and <hi>this</hi> ground only, reſts our ſpiritual reform under Harry the VIIIth, and that moſt glorious of all civil revolutions—the Revolution by which James II. loſt the throne of these realms.</p>
               <p>Thoſe gentlemen who plead for the omnipotence of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and the infallibility of their codes, ſhould advert to the many abſurd, contradictory poſitions and doctrines laid down during the contention of the ſeveral pretenders of the Plantagenet line, and afterwards of the heireſſes of the Houſe of Tuder.</p>
               <p>In fact, Sir, your ſtatutes of thoſe days borrowed too frequently their maxims and complexion from whatſoever brow might happen to be encircled with the regal diadem. In the reign of King Richard II. a law paſſed to tranſfer the power of both houſes of parliament to twelve barons. By an act under one of the Henries, the King's proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the conſent of his pravy-council, was thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward to carry with it the force and efficacy of a law of the land. And we all know that the parliament of 1641 voted itſelf perpetted, never to be diſſolved nor prorogued
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:014092_0035_0F92DE01B3092B98"/>
but by its own conſent; and the act read by an honourable member to the committee on the preſent reſolution, and which he treated with ſo much deference, becauſe it declared the people of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay in a ſtate of revolt, was paſſed by this immaculate parliament.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, let us ſuppoſe (what in theſe our uncorrupt days there can be no reaſon to apprehend) that a ſtatute ſhould be procured by ſome future miniſter and minion of the Sovereign. veſting the whole legiſlative as well as exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive power in the crown, totally to aboliſh both houſes of parliament; would ſuch ſtatute be valid and binding on the ſubject throughout Great-Britain and America? All perſons have natural rights—a <hi>free</hi> people have legal rights, independent, of parliamentary edicts, and of which no form of government whatever can deprive them. Laws not founded on conſtitutional juſtice, are in themſelves null and void; nor are the makers of them legiſlators, but <hi>uſurpers.</hi>

               <p>A very wiſe and learned writer (Judge Blackſtone) has in his commentaries the following paſſage: "If the ſovereign power advance with gigantic ſtrides to threaten deſolation to a ſtate, mankind will not be reaſoned out of the feelings of humanity, nor will ſacrifice their liberty in a ſcrupulous adherence to thoſe political maxims, which were originally eſtabliſhed to preſerve that liberty."</p>

They live on plain, wholeſome diet; their progeny is healthful, and of boundleſs increaſe; whereas in nations that have reached their full zenith of luxury, the maſs of the people are occupied at ſedentary arts and manufactures, drawing in, from morn to eve, an impure, confined atmoſphere, or brooding over unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome furnaces: hence the vital <hi>ſtamina</hi> are hurt, the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites ſoon appaled, the ſpirits eaſily depreſſed; they become enfeebled ere the ſand of their mortal glaſs be half run out; their offspring is ſapleſs and emaſculate.</p>

Remember, Sir, your proweſs at the eve of that ſame war, near the banks of the Tagus.</p>
               <p>The love or enmity of one people to another, cannot be eſtimated by their occaſional alliances, compacts, or guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees, as a body politic. It is but a century ago that our Engliſh brigades ſerved with unparallelled ardor in the army of that arch-enemy to civil and religious liberty, Lewis XIV. of France; the execrated revocator of the edict of Nantz; the aſpirer to univerſal deſpotiſm. We ſerved, Sir, againſt a people, whoſe tolerance and charity of religion, whoſe whole ſyſtem and freedom of government we at that very time held in emulative veneration; a people whoſe

               <p>Such coertion were highly <hi>impolitic,</hi> becauſe it is from the proſperity, peace, and contentment of her colonies, that reſources of wealth and laurels of honour are won to a mother country. Hiſtory teaches us, that populouſneſs and affluence are the product of that clime alone, where the people may reap in ſecurity a full harveſt of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; where they have affluence in their leaders and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors; where no exactions are inflicted by an alien hand; where the <hi>municipal,</hi> if not the <hi>imperial</hi> juriſdiction, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the power of levying taxes, are veſted in ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of their own free choice or approbation.</p>
               <p>That ſaying of a deſpot, "<hi>Oderint dum metuant,"</hi> may be applicable to the ſwarthy ſons of the oppoſite diviſion of the globe; but, Sir, it will never accord with the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our brethren in America.</p>
               <p>Threats and violence uſed againſt hearts of the ſame ſturdy temper with your own, muſt induce the moſt calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous events to both parties.

According to the horological predictions of a moſt enlightened ſtate ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayer, we have about ſeven years more of profound tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility with the Houſe of Bourbon to truſt to; but, from the ſymptoms of our domeſtic diſtraction, and the improved ſtate of the government and finances of our neighbours, I ſhould judge it prudent to be ſomewhat better provided than we are at preſent for an early rupture; not entirely to diſmantle our ports and our coaſts of ſoldiers and ſeamen, ſent to immolate the martyrs to liberty of their own fleſh and blood, on the diſtant continent of America.</p>
               <p>It has been made evident to you, that a defection of the northern colonies will ſoon bring on the complete ruin of your Weſt-India ſettlements, which cannot elſewhere afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably provide themſelves with cattle, lumber, and divers other articles requiſite for the ſupport of a plantation.</p>
               <p>Let us turn our eyes to the inland trading towns here at home; thoſe large iron founderies which uſed to ſupply the anchors of commerce and implements for huſbandry and the ingenious arts, and now ſet at work in moulding the ſword and the bayonet to enſlave America. From the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions there accrued conſtant returns of profit, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs comforts; from the latter, what can be expected but poverty, dejection, and mourning!

               <p>It is well known, through melancholy obſervation, drawn from the fate of the Aſſyrian, Perſian, and Roman empires, that national ſocieties, as well as the individual mortals of whom thoſe ſocieties are compoſed, have their non-age, their adult vigour, and their decline.

America, as an earneſt of her triumph over the future labours for which envy and malice may reſerve her, has, like another Hercules in the cradle, already grappled with thoſe two ſerpents ſent for her deſtruction. Neither ſhall we be long able to ſuſtain the unhallowed war at ſo remote a diſtance;—unexplored deſarts, wood-land ambuſcades, latitudes to which few of our ſoldiery have been ſeaſoned; the ſouthern provinces ſcarce to be endured in the ſummer months, the northern provinces not approachable in the winter ſeaſon;—ſhipwrecks, peſtilence, famine. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relenting inveteracy and carnage of York and Lancaſter, will here be joined to all the elementary hardſhips and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies of a bigot cruſade. Shall not ſuch dreadful aeras in our earlier chronicle, ſerve us for beacons at this perilous criſis? Thoſe raſh expeditions indeed, undertaken by a few martial zealots on miſconceived piety, began to decline at the death of the hot-brained, ſavage-hearted King, under whom they were firſt enterprized; and the ſluices of kindred blood, which had long inundated the land in the red and white roſes, were at length happily put a ſtop to, by a ſingle matrimonial contract. Now, Sir, who can look

               <p>Far be it from me to anticipate by conjecture to either country ſo dreadful a ſentence; but, Sir, without a gift of preternatural foreſight, I may remark, that there are features in the aſpect of infant America, which denote at maturer years a moſt coloſſal force. <hi>The Helvetic and Flemiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacies</hi> have demonſtrated what extraordinary obſtacles a ſmall band of inſurgents may ſurmount in the cauſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

It appears from one of the American letters of a late date brought to your table, that the inhabitants of Boſton were inclined to copy in part theſe dire examples; that they meditated to abandon the town with their wives and families, and the reducing it to aſhes.</p>
               <p>Did not we ourſelves give a very ſtriking proof at the commencement of the 12th century, to what an incendiary height the flame of vengeance might reach, when we invited over, and received into the very centre of this iſland, a whole army of Frenchmen to aid us againſt a tyrant monarch and his iniquitous counſellors? We owe perhaps that ſacred palladium of our liberty, Magna Charta, as much to a Dauphin of France, as to a King of England.</p>
               <p>The Americans alledge, that what they now contend for is that reaſonable portion of liberty with which they were chartered as their birthright, not by any earthly potentate, but by the King of Kings, "to make their lives happy, in the poſſeſſion of which liberty they do now hourly invoke that King of Kings, or to make their death glorious in its juſt defence."</p>

What is the aim and ſcope of the reſolution before you? To lure ſome of the leſs refractory provinces of America, to diſſociate from, and betray their fellow-ſufferers; to join in raiſing a contribution throughout one half of the colonies, to ſupport your armaments and outrages againſt the other half, with a view to annihilate trade, cut off every natural channel of livelihood and ſubſiſtence, and butcher the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient; and how are theſe ſeceders to be recompenſed for ſuch ſignal perfidy? Why, by a temporary exerciſe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain empty forms and modes of taxation, confirming at the ſame time a right in the crown and Parliament of Great-Britain, to fix the groſs amount of all continental ſubſidies whatſoever; that is, in fact, they are to be ſtill ſubject to a miniſterial majority in this Houſe, which may levy impoſts on them, not by any fair ſcale of proportion, to the burthen laid on the mother country, but the demand may perhaps be carried beyond their abilities, or they may be liable to the diſcharge of an immenſe national debt.

               <p>HE moved, that the following clauſe be inſerted in the bill, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "Provided always, and be it further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, that nothing in this act contained ſhall extend, or be conſtrued to extend, to prohibit the importation into any or either of the ſaid colonies or provinces, of fuel, corn, meal, flour, or other victual brought coaſtwife from any part of America." This clauſe, ſaid he, cannot be objected to, even by the moſt vindictive ſpirit, againſt the four provinces of New-England, who are the objects of this bill, as it is extracted from the Boſton port bill of the laſt year. The lenity or humanity of which was never ſo much as pretended, even by its advocates. There cannot

The vote I allude to is paſſed but a few days ſince; which ſays, or pretends to ſay, that it would have been <hi>proper</hi> (that is the term) to have proceeded in a way of aſking a ſupply of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, by the conſtitutional way of requiſitions, before proceeding to compulſory or forcible methods. Having confeſſed ourſelves wrong in the foundation, it is but equal juſtice to our rellow ſubjects of meric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſedly in an unconſtitutional way. Surely then, it is not a time to add to the ſeverity of our acts, in proportion as we find, that we have been unjuſt in the outſet, and that they have been leſs to blame. It is ſurely but a little matter to aſk, that you would not be more ſevere or cruel towards America, who have never been heard on their defence this year, than you were the laſt. Beſides, what conſtruction can the town of Boſton put upon your meaſures, if you refuſe the clauſe now of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered? They will be beſieged, as in actual war with a foreign enemy. General Gage has fortified the Neck which joins Boſton to the continent, by which he may intercept proviſions; and by this bill you proclaim the ſame intention by ſea. Do you expect, that they will ſubmit to be ſtarved, in paſſive obedience? What reſource have they left, but reſiſtance; and, perhaps, to take advantage of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of numbers of General Gage's troops, before they are reinforced; for this act puts it out of all doubt, that you mean to proceed to all extremities. I have been informed, by thoſe who know beſt the temper of the Americans, and I hope and believe that they will hold out their patience to the utmoſt, and that they will not ſtrike the firſt blow: but what is the difference to them, whether you ſtrike the firſt blow by the muſket or the ſword, or, to equal effect, by famine? The refuſal of this clauſe will be a declaration
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:014092_0044_0F92DE07D5BCD5A8"/>
on your part, that you mean to bring famine upon them, to the utmoſt of your power, and therefore a warning to them of the mercy which they are to expect at your hands. As to the bill in general, it has been ſo ably debated by my friends near me, that I ſhall only add two remarks: this bill, by deſtroying the North-American fiſhery, not only deſtroys that nurſery of ſeamen, but will diſable the provinces, under the prohibition, from the means of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their debts to this country, who therefore will finally be the ſufferers; and when the next year comes, and you find this conſequence, you will then turn accuſers of the North-Americans for not paying their debts, and you will add, according to the uſual falſhoods towards the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, that they never intended to pay their debts; and, by the diſtance of the place, and the falſhood of repreſentations, you will impute thoſe very effects which you have produced yourſelves, as the juſtifying cauſes of reſentment. This is the unjuſt way in which the Americans have been treated, on all occaſions. I myſelf aſked, the other day, why, on a particular occaſion of a ſlight riot of not more than a few hours continuance four regiments and a train of artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, were ordered to Boſton? To juſtify this enormous intervention of the military, I was told in this Houſe, that indeed the riots were trifling, but that the Americans had come to a reſolution to arm the country. What then was the real fact, as teſtified by dates? The fact was, that the reſolution to arm, was not taken till the troops were ſeen in the offing. It was the fight of the troops, upon ſo trivial an occaſion, that gave to underſtand what they were to expect; and, by dates, the fact is verified, that they did not take to arms till ſome months after the troops were ordered; but it was upon their firſt notice of the troops being to come, and the reſolution to arm againſt the worſt, was actually debated but a few hours before the troops were landed. So it is that facts are miſrepreſented in America, and ſo let me put in my caution <hi>now,</hi> that the Americans do <hi>now</hi> actually pay their debts, like honeſt men, to the utmoſt of their power, and let me be before hand with this change; if when the natural conſequences
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:014092_0045_0F92DE089F9A0AC8"/>
of theſe meaſures come next year, we ſhould hear any falſe accuſations of the Americans, as combining not to pay their debts, I ſhall make but one remark more, but which ſeems to me to be of the utmoſt importance to the whole commercial ſyſtem of England, which is, that the plantation-built bottoms are two thirds, or three quarters, of all the bottoms upon which the Britiſh merchandize, to every quarter of the globe, is carried on; when we medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a blow at the American trade, we ſhould recollect at leaſt, that there is this one manufacture (if I may ſo call it) of ſhip-building, upon the encouragement of which our very exiſtence in this kingdom, as a trading people, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. However we may think it our intereſt to ſuppreſs the rivalſhip of the colonies with ourſelves, in other manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, yet in this trade of ſhip-building, they are our moſt material and eſſential ſupport. This revengeful blow at the American ſhip-building, will fall moſt immediately and fatally upon the manufacturers and merchants of every commercial article in this kingdom. For theſe reaſons, I am againſt the whole principle of the bill now before us; and if we cannot prevail to have the whole rejected, I muſt humbly move, at leaſt, the admiſſion of the clauſe which I have juſt now offered to the Houſe.</p>

I thought it was but juſtice to hear the arguments that might be urged on both ſides, to compare thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and draw my opinion from that compariſon. As to the bill, immediately the object of our conſideration, I think it in every reſpect to arbitrary, ſo oppreſſive, and ſo totally founded on principles of reſentment, that I am exceedingly happy at having this public opportunity of bearing my teſtimony againſt it, in the ſtrongeſt manner I am able. In God's name, what language are you now holding out to America! Reſign your property, diveſt yourſelves of your privileges and freedom, renounce every thing that can make life comfortable, or we will deſtroy your commerce, we will involve your country in all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of famine; and if you expreſs the ſenſations of men at ſuch harſh treatment, we will then declare you in a ſtate of rebellion, and put yourſelves, and your families, to fire and ſword. And yet, Sir, the noble Lord on the floor has told this Houſe, that a reconciliation is the ſole object of his wiſhes. I hope the noble Lord will pardon me, if I doubt the perfect ſincerity of thoſe wiſhes; at leaſt, Sir, his actions juſtify my doubts; for every circumſtance in his whole conduct, with regard to America, has directly militated againſt his preſent profeſſions: and what, Sir, muſt the Americans conclude? Whilſt you are ravaging their coaſts, and extirpating their commerce, and are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held only by your impotence, from ſpreading freſh ruin by the ſword, can they, Sir, ſuppoſe ſuch chaſtiſement is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to promote a reconciliation, and that you mean to reſtore to their forlorn country thoſe liberties you deny to their preſent poſſeſſion; and in the inſolence of perſecution, are compaſſing earth and ſea to deſtroy? You can with no more juſtice compel the Americans to your obedience, by the operation of the preſent meaſures, by making uſe of their neceſſities, and withholding from them that commerce on which their exiſtence depends; than a ruffian can found an equitable claim to my poſſeſſions, when he forcibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters my houſe, and with a dagger at my throat, or a piſtol at my breaſt, makes me ſeal deeds which will convey to him my eſtate and property.</p>

Though I have ſo lately had the honour of a ſeat in this Houſe, yet I have for many years turned my thoughts and attention to matters of public concern and national policy. This queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of America, is now of many years ſtanding; of the greateſt public notoriety, as to the facts upon which it turns; and every opinion has been ſo fully debated over and over, that any man who has given his mind to public buſineſs, may be ſuppoſed equally informed out of the Houſe as in it.</p>

When I threw out the propoſitions caſually before Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, which I ſhall offer to you more formally to-day, my view was in no ſort hoſtile to the adminiſtration. I ſaw the difficulty that we were got into by our own precipitancy; that unhappy dilemma, which offered nothing but ruin in going forward, or diſgrace in the retreat. I was in hopes, from ſome phraſes dropt by the noble Lord at the head of the treaſury, in the beginning of the ſeſſion, of others being more ſanguine and more impatient than himſelf; that he at leaſt would have ſhewn ſome diſpoſition to relent; and, I ſtill believe, if he were at liberty to follow his own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and judgment, that it would be ſo. I am the more warranted in thinking ſo, from the propoſition which the noble Lord himſelf offered to the Houſe ſome time ago. There was in that propoſition, a ſhew of conciliation to captivate one ſide of the Houſe, and ſufficient to betray what were his own wiſhes; but on the other ſide there was the reality of every unrelenting and vindictive meaſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, to prove, that there ſtill were others more ſanguine and more impatient than himſelf; over whom, with all his abilities, with all his eloquence, with all the advantages of his ſituation, he could not maintain his aſcendant. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtruggles the noble Lord may have had with himſelf or his friends, they are all at an end; the dye is caſt for war with America. It was found, that any conciliatory propoſition muſt have been in ſome degree a conceſſion, which none of his unrelenting friends would conſent to.</p>
               <p>However, by the noble Lord's propoſition, there is one conceſſion made to America, under the authority of this Houſe, which cannot be recalled; and which finally and concluſively condemns the conduct of every adminiſtration for theſe ten years paſt, one excepted; I mean the repeal of the ſtamp-act. If it can be proper <hi>now</hi> to offer to the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, to pay upon requiſition, what can this nation ſay for having kept out of the only right road for <hi>ten years?</hi> How can we cenſure the colonies for any errors committed by them, which were the conſequences of our beginning at the wrong end? Though a threat is now annexed to the noble Lord's requiſition, yet if, at firſt, we had begun with
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:014092_0050_0F92DE0DED1C7A28"/>
a requiſition inſtead of taxation, it would have been more juſt and prudent. There could be no juſtice or prudence in threatening a people who had always contributed moſt freely; who never would have called our ſuppoſed right in queſtion, but for our miſapplication of it. Therefore, Sir, when I have brought back the noble Lord's compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory requiſition, to my free requiſition, it ſtands confeſſed, upon the very nature of his propoſition itſelf, that I have ſet it upon its own true original ground.</p>
               <p>There is another objection to the noble Lord's plan, which, as I have mentioned it upon a former occaſion, I ſhall only remind you in a few words: I mean a breach of faith with the colonies. A Secretary of State writes, in 1769, a circular letter to the colonies, to aſſure them, That you will never raiſe a revenue by taxing. A few years after, upon a negociation with the Eaſt-India Company, the three-penny tea tax becomes not merely a quit-rent for the point of honour, but riſes to an actual revenue. Then you plead, that you did not break your word, as the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ariſing was not in your original intentions, but only caſual, from a regulation of trade. But what can you ſay now? The noble Lord boaſts, that he has put the queſtion upon the true ground, a demand for a ſubſtantial revenue, a demand attended with threats of compulſion. What is this leſs than raiſing a revenue by a tax?</p>
               <p>But in any caſe, let the noble Lord think what he will of his propoſition, why has he not, in ſo many weeks, given it ſome practicable ſhape? Why has he not offered ſome act of Parliament to give it effect? However, as he has omitted that, I ſhall take the propoſition without its objectional parts, and propoſe an addreſs to the King to give it force; in which motion, I hope to meet with the ſupport of thoſe gentlemen who gave it countenance originally, when it came from the noble Lord. I ſhall give the whole ſubſtance of the propoſition; only leaving out in the addreſs to the King, any threats of the compulſion, which you meditate in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. If you think that you have the right of taxing, I paſs it over in ſilence,—if you have the power, I do not,—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, take that away. Then make a free requiſition; and be
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:014092_0051_0F92DE0EB2693A48"/>
contented to keep to yourſelves the ſatisfaction of thinking, that you have ſomething in reſerve, in caſe of non-compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Keep that <hi>ſub ſilentio;</hi> at leaſt till you find that it becomes neceſſary. I am not an advocate either for the right or the expediency of taxing the Americans, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. However, as far as we go the ſame road of requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, let us go together.</p>
               <p>As what I have to offer, will be founded upon requiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the colonies, I will endeavour to anſwer an objection before hand, which I have heard in this Houſe. It is to the plan of <hi>royal</hi> requiſitions. This objection to the interference of the royal name, comes from a ſide of the Houſe, from which one ſhould leaſt have expected it. However if this be an objection, mine are not <hi>royal</hi> requiſitions. My motion originates from the Houſe of Commons, to deſire the King, as the executive magiſtrate, to put <hi>their</hi> plan into effect. If the power of making requiſitions to the colonies, is not in the King; my motion is to give the authority and ſanction of Parliament to this meaſure. It is ſo far from being my propoſition, to enable the crown to raiſe what ſupply it can from America, independent of Parliament; that my motion is the very firſt which has ever had in contemplation, to lay a parliamentary controul upon that power; and to require that all anſwers from America ſhall be laid before this Houſe for the very purpoſe of controuling that power in the crown. I have ſo doubly guarded that point, that my motion is not even for the crown to demand a ſupply from America; but for ſervices to be performed in America; for the defence, ſecurity and protection of the colonies themſelves.</p>
               <p>I would wiſh to ſtate to the Houſe the merits of this queſtion, of requiſitions to the colonies; and to ſee upon what principles it is founded; to reviſe and ſettle the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts between Great-Britain and her colonies; and then, upon a foundation of diſtributive juſtice, to come to ſome ſettlement. We hear of nothing now, but the protection which we have given to them; of the immenſe expence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred on their account.—We are told that they have done nothing for themſelves; that they pay no taxes; in ſhort,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:014092_0052_0F92DE0F6610A8D0"/>
every thing is aſſerted about America to ſerve the preſent turn, without the leaſt regard to truth—I would have theſe matters fairly ſifted out.</p>
               <p>To begin with the late war. The Americans turned the ſucceſs of the war, at both ends of the line. General Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton took Beauſejour in Nova-Scotia, with 1500 provincial troops, and about 200 regulars. Sir William Johnſon in the other part of America, changed the face of the war to ſucceſs, with a provincial army, which took Baron Dieſkau priſoner. But, Sir, the glories of the war, under the united Britiſh and American arms, are recent and in every one's memory. Suffice it to decide this queſtion; that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans bore, even in our judgment, more than their full proportion; that this Houſe did annually vote them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of their zeal and ſtrenuous efforts, and a compenſation of the exceſs of their zeal and expences, above their due proportion. They kept, one year with another, 20,000 men on foot, and loſt in the war the flower of their youth. How ſtrange muſt it appear to them to hear of nothing down to the year 1763, (March 14, 1763) but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums upon their <hi>active zeal and ſtrenuous efforts,</hi> and then, no longer after than the year 1764, in ſuch a trice of time, to ſee the tide turn, and from that hour to this, to hear it aſſerted they were a burden upon the common cauſe; aſſerted even in that ſame Parliament, which had voted them compenſations for the liberality and exceſs of their ſervices.</p>
               <p>Nor did they ſtint their ſervices to North-America: They followed the Britiſh arms out of their continent, to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannah and Martinique, after the compleat conqueſt of America. And ſo they had done in the preceeding war. They were not grudging of their exertions,—they were at the ſiege of Carthagena,—yet what was Carthagena to them, but as members of the common cauſe, of the glory of this country! In that war too, Sir, they took Louiſbourg from the French, ſingle-handed, without any European aſſiſtance; as mettled an enterprize as any in our hiſtory! an everlaſting memorial of the zeal, courage, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the troops of New-England. The men themſelves
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:014092_0053_0F92DE101CE70C40"/>
dragged the cannon over a moraſs which had always been thought impaſſable, where neither horſes nor oxen could go, and they carried the ſhot upon their backs. And what was their reward for this forward and ſpirited enterprize? for the reduction of this American Dunkirk? Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Sir, you know very well; it was given up for a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to the Dutch, the only conqueſt in that war which you had to give up, which would have been an effectual barrier to them againſt the French power in America, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querred by themſelves, was ſurrendered for a foreign barrier. As a ſubſtitute for this, you ſettle Halifax for a <hi>place d' armes,</hi> leaving the limits of the province of Nova-Scotia as a matter of conteſt with the French, which could not fail to prove, as it did, the cauſe of another war. Had you kept Louiſbourg inſtead of ſettling Halifax, the Americans may ſay, at leaſt, that there would not have been that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uting the late war to their account. It has been their forwardneſs in your cauſe, that made them the objects of the French reſentment. In the war of 1744, at your requiſition, they were the aggreſſors with the French in America. We know the orders given to Monſ. D'Anville, to deſtroy and lay all their ſea-port towns in aſhes; and we know the cauſe of that reſentment; it was to revenge their conqueſt of Louiſbourg.</p>
               <p>Whenever Great-Britain has declared war, they have taken their part. They were engaged in King William's wars and Queen Ann's, even in their infancy. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Acadia in the laſt century, for us; and we then gave it up.—Again, in Queen Ann's war they conquered Nova-Scotia which, from that time, has always belonged to Great-Britain. They have been engaged in more than one expedition to Canada, ever foremoſt to partake of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and danger with the mother country.</p>
               <p>Well, Sir, what have we done for them? Have we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the country for them from the Indians? Have we cleared it? Have we drained it? Have we made it habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? What have we done for them; I believe preciſely nothing at all, but juſt keeping watch and ward over their trade, that they ſhould receive nothing but from ourſelves
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:014092_0054_0F92DE1226F582C0"/>
and at our own price. I will not poſitively ſay, that we have ſpent nothing; though I do not recollect any ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle upon our journals; but I mean, not any material ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in ſetting them out as coloniſts. The royal military government of Nova-Scotia coſt, indeed, not a little ſum; above 500,000 l. for its plantation, and its firſt years. Had your other colonies coſt any thing ſimilar, either in their out-ſet or ſupport, there would have been ſomething to ſay on that ſide; but inſtead of that, they have been left to themſelves for 100 or 150 years, upon the fortune and capital of private adventurers, to encounter every difficulty and danger. What towns have we built for them? What deſarts have we cleared? What country have we conquered for them from the Indians? Name the officers—name the troops—the expeditions—their dates. Where are they to be found? Not in the journals of this kingdom. They are no where to be found.</p>
               <p>In all the wars which have been common to us and them, they have taken their full ſhare. But in all their own dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, in all the difficulties belonging ſeparately to their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, in all the Indian wars which did not immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us, we left them to themſelves to ſtruggle their way through. For the whim of a miniſter, you can beſtow half a million to build a town, and to plant the royal colony of Nova-Scotia; a greater ſum than you have beſtowed upon every other colony together, ſince their foundation.</p>
               <p>And notwithſtanding all theſe, which are real facts, now that they have ſtruggled through their difficulties, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to hold up their heads, and to ſhew that empire which promiſes to be the foremoſt in the world, we claim them and theirs, as implicitly belonging to us, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their own rights. We charge them with ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, without the leaſt regard to truth, juſt as if this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom had for a century and a half, attended to no other object; as if all our revenue, all our power, all our thought, had been beſtowed upon them, and all our national debt had been contracted in the Indian wars of America, totally forgetting the ſubordination in commerce and manufactures,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:014092_0055_0F92DE125E988CD0"/>
in which we have bound them; and for which, at leaſt, we owe them help towards their protection.</p>
               <p>Look at the preamble of the act of navigation, and every American act, and ſee if the intereſt of this country is not the avowed object. If they make a hat or a piece of ſteel, an act of Parliament calls it a nuiſance: a tilting hammer, a ſteel furnace muſt be abated in America as a nuiſance. Is it ſo with their fellow ſubjects on this ſide of the Atlantic? Are the hats and cloths of Glouceſterſhire nuiſances? Are the tilting hammers of Pontipool nuiſances? Are the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of Sheffield and Birmingham nuiſances? Are the ſtockings of Nottingham nuiſances? Are the linens of Scotland, Ireland, or Broomſgrove nuiſances? Are the woollen cloths of Yorkſhire, the crapes of Norwich, or the cottons of Mancheſter, nuiſances? Sir, I ſpeak from facts. I call your books of ſtatutes and journals to witneſs. With the leaſt recollection every one muſt acknowledge the truth of theſe facts.</p>
               <p>But it is ſaid, the peace eſtabliſhment of North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica has been, and is, very expenſive to this country. Sir, for what has been let us take the peace eſtabliſhment before 1739, and after 1748. All that I can find in your journals is, four companies kept up at New-York, and three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies in Carolina. As to the four companies at New-York, this country ſhould know beſt why they put themſelves to that expence; or whether they were really at any expence at all; for theſe were companies of fictitious men. Unleſs the money was repaid into the treaſury, it was applied to ſome other purpoſe; for theſe companies were not a quarter full. In the year 1754, two of them were ſent up to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, to attend commiſſioners to treat with the Six Nations, to impreſs them with a high idea of our military power; to diſplay all the pomp and circumſtance of war before them, in hopes to ſcare them; when in truth, we made a very ridiculous figure. The whole complement of the two companies did not exceed thirty tattered, tottering invalids, fitter to ſcarce the crows. This information I have had from eye-witneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:014092_0056_0F92DE130E38CEE0"/>
It has not fallen in my way to hear any account of the three Carolina companies; theſe are trifles. The ſubſtantial queſtion is, what material expence have you been at in the periods alluded to, for the peace eſtabliſhment of North-America? Ranſack your journals, ſearch your public offices for army or ordnance expences. Make out your bill, and let us ſee what it is. No one yet knows it. Had there been any ſuch, I believe the adminiſtration would have produced it before now, with aggravation; as was the caſe a few years ago with the Eaſt-India Company, who had their effects arreſted for a long bill, when they little expected it, and that bill too not very ſcrupulouſly charged; but when money is in the caſe, whether from the Eaſt or from the Weſt, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters can make as long bills as other people.</p>
               <p>But is not the peace eſtabliſhment of North-America now very high, and very expenſive? I would anſwer that by another queſtion; Why would the peace eſtabliſhment ſince the late war, and the total expulſion of the French intereſt, be higher than it was before the late war, and when the French poſſeſſed above half the American continent? If it be ſo, there muſt be ſome ſingular reaſon.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſuppoſe that you mean, under the general term of North-America, to ſaddle all the expences of Canada, Nova-Scotia, Cape-Breton, Newfoundland, Florida, and the Weſt-Indies, upon the old colonies of North-America. You cannot mean to keep the ſovereignty, the property, the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion (theſe are the terms of the ceſſion in the treaty of 1763) to yourſelves, and lay the expence of the military eſtabliſhment, which you think proper to keep up, upon the old colonies.</p>
               <p>Sir, the colonies never thought of interfering in the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of making war or peace; but if this nation can be ſo unjuſt as to meditate the ſettling the expence of your new conqueſts ſeparately upon them, they ought to have had a voice in ſettling the terms of peace. It is you, on this ſide of the water, who have firſt brought out the idea of ſeparate intereſts, by planning ſeparate and diſtinct charges. It was <hi>their</hi> men, and <hi>their</hi> money, which had conquered North-America and the Weſt Indies, as well as yours, though you
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:014092_0057_0F92DE13D23C80B8"/>
ſeized all the ſpoils; but they never thought of dictating to you what you ſhould keep, or what you ſhould give up, little dreaming that you reſerved the expence of your mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary governments for them. Who gave up the Havannah? Who gave up Martinique? Who gave up Guadaloupe, with Mariegalante? Who gave up Santa Lucia? Who gave up the Newfoundland fiſhery? Who gave up all theſe, without <hi>their</hi> conſent, without <hi>their</hi> participation, without <hi>their</hi> conſultation, and after all without equivalents? Sir, if your colonies had but been permitted to have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up the crumbs which have fallen from your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>table, they would gladly have ſupported the whole eſtabliſhment of North-America.</p>
               <p>Your colonies have now ſhewn you the value of lands in North-America; and therefore you have veſted in the crown the ſovereignty, property, and poſſeſſion of infinite tracts of land, perhaps as extenſive as all Europe, which the crown may diſpoſe of at its own price, as the land riſes in America, and grants become invaluable; and to enable the crown to ſupport an arbitrary military, nay, even a Romiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till theſe lands riſe to their future immenſe value, you are caſting about to ſaddle the expence either upon the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican or the Britiſh ſupplies. The Americans muſt, indeed, be in a ſtate of inſanity, if they do not ſee the tendency of all this; and we ourſelves muſt be more inſane and blind even than the Americans: We, who have already ſeen the patronage of the Eaſt-Indies put into the hands of the crown, and who now ſee the ſovereignty, property, and poſſeſſion of North-America, with every military and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic power, veſted ſolely in the King's hands; we, who are made to learn every hour, by precept and example, the charters, being but the breath of Kings, are to be annihilated by the breath of pliable Parliaments; we muſt be, Sir, I ſay, more inſane than them, if we do not ſee the tendency of all this; and if we do not provide in time for our own ſecurity, as well as for that of America. I will not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that we can be ſo improvident as not to attend to theſe important and perhaps not very diſtant events; nor, with reſpect to the preſent queſtion, will, I ſuppoſe, that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:014092_0058_0F92DE14CEF2FB08"/>
can meditate ſo great an injuſtice, as to require your old colonies to ſupport the charge of all your new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and of all the reſt of America.</p>
               <p>This country is very liberal in its boaſting of its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and parental kindneſs to America. Is it for that purpoſe that we have converted the province of Canada into an abſolute and military government, and have eſtabliſhed the Romiſh bigotry dominant, as a terror upon all our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and proteſtant colonies? What ſecurity, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection do they derive? In what ſort are they the better for the conqueſt of the French dominions, if we take that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to eſtabliſh a government, civil, military, and eccleſiaſtical, in the utmoſt degree hoſtile to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our own provinces, and with the intent to ſet a thorn in their ſides: Is this affection and parental kindneſs? Surely you do not expect that they ſhould be taxed and talliaged to pay for this rod of iron which you are prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them!</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, I come to a point, in which I think you may be ſaid to have given ſome protection. I mean the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your fleet to the American commerce. And even here I am at a loſs by what terms to call it; whether you are protecting yourſelves or them. They are <hi>your</hi> cargoes, <hi>your</hi> manufactures, <hi>your</hi> commerce, <hi>your</hi> navigation. Every ſhip from America is bound to Great-Britain. None enter an American port, but Britiſh ſhips and men. While you are defending the American commerce, you are defending Leeds and Halifax, Sheffield and Birmingham, Mancheſter and Hull, Briſtol and Liverpool, London, Dublin, and Glaſgow. However, as our fleet does protect whatever commerce does belong to them, let that be ſet to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. It is an argument to them, as well as to us. As it has been the ſole policy of this kingdom, for ages, by the operation of every commercial act of parliament, to make the American commerce totally ſubſervient to our own convenience, the leaſt we owe to them in return is protection.</p>
               <p>Sir, I have now ſtated my ſentiments upon the prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary matters. I have endeavoured to ſtate the ſervices, in
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:014092_0059_0F92DE155D48D768"/>
war, of the Americans, with ours, and their mutual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions; in which, by our own confeſſion, the Americans have taken more than their ſhare. I have ſtated the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of your military eſtabliſhment for them, ſuch as it has been, or ſuch as it need to be, always proteſting againſt the impoſition of the charge of the conquered provinces upon them; and I have ſtated the neceſſity and convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of your fleet to their commerce. Let this line of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the queſtion, be purſued to what minuteneſs you will, in order that we may come to a fundamental judgment; let debtor or creditor fall on which ſide it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll, I have no bias to either ſide of the argument; but to have perfect and liberal juſtice done, and reconcilement, if poſſible effected, upon ſound and equitable principles. I will beg leave to read to the Houſe a draught of a letter of requiſition, which I have drawn up after the manner of former requiſitions to the colonies, and which I have endeavoured to adapt to the preſent circumſtances.</p>
               <p>[Here he read a letter of requiſition to the colonies.]</p>
               <p>This is the plan, and the terms, or to the effect, that, according to the beſt of my judgment, a requiſition on the preſent ſubject ſhould be drawn. I have endeavoured to ſtate the caſe in ſuch a manner as may open a way to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement on both ſides. Make your requiſitions free, and let them be founded on reaſon and juſtice; and there are no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in any kingdom that will be deaf to reaſon, juſtice, common intereſt, and mutual obligations: And I am ſure, from the repeated liberality and zeal of our colonies, we, of all the kingdoms in the world, have the leaſt reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt thoſe of our own conſanguinity.</p>
               <p>I cannot think it a poſſible thing in our conſtitution, that any one ſeriouſly, upon a moment's reflection, can admit the thought of denying the Americans their judgment upon the neceſſity or application of money required. That is the right of all free ſubjects, without which they have nothing they can call their own. Let your requiſitions be free, for reaſonable and ſubſtantial ſervices, and faithfully performed, and there is no example of a refuſal in ſuch a caſe, in any ſtate. That conſents are withheld, and ought ſo to be, in
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:014092_0060_0F92DE161E1FD290"/>
caſe of grievances unredreſſed, our own hiſtory abounds with examples. Our rights and liberties would have long ago been trampled under foot but for that reſerved power in the commons. But a refuſal, in a reaſonable caſe, is as yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out example. Abſurdity and caprice are not the principles which govern men, in the great concerns of ſtate; but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon over-rules all little caprices. In Holland, the conſent not only of the States-general, but of the provincial ſtates, and in many inſtances, I believe, of every town in each province, is neceſſary for great acts of ſtate; and yet that negative never ſtands in the way againſt reaſon. Where meaſures have common ſenſe, and common reaſon, for their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they will never be obſtructed; where they have not, they ought to be defeated.</p>
               <p>But it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aid, that we can hear of no terms with the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, who have been in a ſtate of reſiſtance to our authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Sir, I wiſh to caſt no retroſpect, but only to look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to reconciliation, and to prevent the ſhedding of blood. The reſolution of the noble Lord has confeſſed, and the Houſe has adopted the truth of it, that requiſition is the proper way. Your colonies have been calling our to you inceſſantly, for ten years, to make your demands by conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional requiſitions. This Houſe, after a ten years miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding, has confirmed that to be, in their opinion too, the right way. Then why not cloſe now at leaſt upon that ground, without retroſpect. The colonies have been driven to reſiſtance againſt their wills, leſt they ſhould have nothing they could ſurely call their own. The right to take any nation's money indefinitely, without their conſent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, without account, without any enquiry into the application, is not to be conceded or compromiſed by any nation upon the earth. Reſiſtance or ruin muſt infallibly be the conſequence; and thoſe who are compelled to reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by your having perſevered in the principle of taking by force, till the noble Lord's propoſition, which has at laſt condemned it, have been forced to deny that authority, which they always had, and always would have wiſhed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and ſupport. It was that unconquerable and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable impulſe of nature, ſelf-defence, which cut off all retreat: then let us caſt no retroſpect. If the grounds of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:014092_0061_0F92DE16CFD5D540"/>
this unhappy diſpute can be ſettled, all may be peace yet. If the Americans could be aſſured, that you would not again make reſiſtance abſolutely neceſſary to their ſecurity and very being as a people, they are ready enough to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their ſubordination, and all the rights of Great-Britain. Let them know that peace and ſecurity to their rights and properties ſhall be the certain condition of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the ſupreme legiſlation of this country, and the matter is ended.</p>
               <p>Sir, after I ſhall have received the determination of the Houſe upon the motion for requiſitions, I ſhall take the liberty to offer three other motions, for a ſuſpenſion of the three vindictive American bills of the laſt ſeſſion. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of thoſe motions with the preceeding, is too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to require any explanation or debate. I would only take leave to ſay, that I ſhould not have moved for a mere ſuſpenſion of theſe bills, if a motion for their repeal had not already been rejected by this Houſe. Having given an unavailing vote for thir repeal, I now come to entreat for the next degree, at leaſt for ſuſpenſion. You have excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Boſton, and proſcribed the whole province of New-England unheard: then recollect your juſtice, and whether you ſend the noble Lord's compulſory requiſition to America, or this motion of mine for a free requiſition; ſuſpend your vindictive hand, and, whilſt you treat for peace, arreſt the ſword.</p>
               <p>Sir, I have now offered what I have to ſay upon this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſubject. I have given it my moſt ſerious, I may ſay my only attention, ever ſince I have been in a ſituation to give a reſponſible vote upon it; and I heartily wiſh that ſome means or other may be found in time to ſtop the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of civil blood. And here, Sir, I offer my poor ſentiments to the Houſe, and to the noble Lord, as in the place of miniſter. It is a great reſponſibility that will lie at his door, who is to have the recommendation. I might ſay the deciſion of the meaſures to be adopted. We on this ſide the Houſe, who have oppoſed the whole ſyſtem of American meaſures, have not done it merely for the ſake of oppoſition. We have not ſheltered ourſelves under—
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:014092_0062_0F92DE1794CBE5F8"/>
No, no,—But we have declared our principles, we have offered our plans; and they muſt now remain with Great-Britain and America at large, to diſcuſs and weigh their merits, to accept or reject them. The noble Lord has a great aſcendant in this Houſe. Perhaps his plan, if he has any thing to be called a plan, may find advocates and voices here. But our country at large, Great-Britain and America, muſt finally decide. My honourable friend near me (Mr. Burker has, with unrivalled ability, opened to you his principles and plan. The Earl of Chatham has, in the other Houſe, offered his proviſional bill for concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the miniſtry there: and for myſelf, Sir, it is with the greateſt deference and humility that I preſume to offer any thing of mine, in conjunction with ſuch great names and abilities. I can only plead the ſincerity of my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as an apology for my preſumption. All our plans tend to one centre, and to one point of reconciliation, to ſave the effuſion of blood between thoſe who ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally good and uſeful friends. If the noble Lord has any ſecret feelings of relenting, as many of his friends, and many more who would be his friends, moſt ſincerely wiſh, let him ſtand our, and do juſtice to his own feelings. His country calls upon him, not to give way to ſangumary and impatient councils, contrary to his own better judgment. This is the deciſive hour; the fate of Great-Britain and America are depending.</p>
               <p>The eyes of all this country, and America too, are turned towards the noble Lord, as the oſtenſible and reſponſible miniſter, to receive his find determination, as to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which are to decide the ſafety or ruin of this empire. The ways of peace are ſtill before him. If war is to be the meaſure with America, let him conſider, that it is not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of this Houſe that can conquer America. The ſupport of reaſon and juſtice to his meaſures will ſtand him better in ſtead, than the noiſy tumult of a majority; in which majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rking treacherous councellors, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended friends, ſecretly urging him to his ruin, even againſt his own judgment. The important reſponſibility is out of meaſure. When the debates and meaſures of this year are

tranſmitted to America, they may, perhaps, tell the noble Lord, had you purſued a plan of equity and juſtice, all had been peace. At home, one plan of conciliation has already been propoſed, for which the city of London, foreſeeing the certain ruin of other meaſures, has given thanks to its great and noble author, as an earneſt for the reſt of the kingdom. If Great-Britain and America ſhould come to one mind of peace, they may unite to cruſh thoſe men who keep them aſunder.</p>

               <head>SIR WILLIAM BAGOT.</head>
               <p>I Riſe, Sir, conſiſtent with the principles I have hitherto profeſſed, to enter my proteſt againſt the bill now before us. I ſhall not, Sir, commence a war with particles, nor ſhall I contend with any Gentleman about the propriety of this or that expreſſion, as whether the Houſe 'might,' 'ſhould,' or 'ought,' to agree to the paſſing of the bill: I ſhall not take up the time of this Houſe about ſuch fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous trifles, though I have been, and do again expect to be, attacked on this head by an ingenious Gentleman [Mr.
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:014092_0064_0F92DE1908D2A2F0"/>
Edmund Burke] whoſe critical ſagacity well qualifies him for the taſk of adjuſting ſentences, and rectifying the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of grammatical niceties. I ſhall requeſt the attention of the Houſe to matters of infinitely greater importance, and, whilſt I relate the reaſons which induce me to oppoſe the bill, I ſhall hope my deficiency in point of elocution may be in ſome degree atoned for by that ſincerity and ſenſe of duty which, conſpiring together, thus prompt me to ſubmit my ſentiments to the candour of this reſpectable Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>To proceed, Sir, with as much regularity as poſſible, I ſhall arrange my arguments under a few general heads: I ſhall ſhew that the very thing theſe Diſſenters pray for is the very thing they now enjoy; that the general toleration ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited would be detrimental to Chriſtianity, the eſtabliſhed religion in this country; that, in the time of Heatheniſm, the toleration allowed was the occaſion of Atheiſts of every denomination over-running the ſtate; and in like manner, if we remove ſubſcription to the articles (it not being them alone, but the doctrines contained in them, which give offence) that therefore, Sir, if we ſet aſide ſubſcription to theſe articles, we throw the beſt barrier of Chriſtianity, and open a door for the admiſſion of infidels of every ſpecies into the pale of the church.</p>
               <p>To begin, Sir, by tracing this bill ſtep by ſtep.—Laſt year an attempt was made to obtrude a petition on this Houſe, which, I am ſorry to ſay, was a diſgrace to every party concerned in the meaſure. I mean Sir, an indelible diſgrace on thoſe perſons without doors who ſet on foot the project; the petition to which I allude is that manufactured at the Feathers Tavern; to the ſhame of ſome of the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal clergy be it ſpoken, they were the firſt who agitated the matter of ſubſcription, and prayed to be releaſed from making the profeſſion of a belief in thoſe articles which contain doctrines clearly revealed in the ſcriptures. This petition, Sir, meeting with the fate in richly deſerved, the preſenting it anſwered no other end than that of paving the way for the application this Houſe has ſince been troubled with. Whilſt the tavern petition was under conſideration,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:014092_0065_0F92DE19C587D138"/>
the promoters were no leſs buſy in publiſhing a variety of pieces addreſſed to ſome particular Biſhops, others to men of eminence in the church, reſident in one or both of our Univerſities. The ſtile of theſe publications was various; ſometimes intimidations were uſed, at others the heads of the church were beſeeched with all humility to relieve thoſe conſcientious prieſts, who, ſooner than not enjoy the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities of the church, would conſcientiouſly turn occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal conformiſts to her doctrines, though they wiſhed to be exempted from the neceſſity of declaring their conformity to any doctrines containing the ſum and ſubſtance of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. About this time, Sir, another reverend author, willing to promote the pious work of reformation, and to declare his own abhorrence of articles which he had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and doctrines he had profeſſed to believe, publiſhed a pamphlet called, THE CONFESSIONAL, a work full of ſophiſtry, abounding in language without ſentiment, and argument without reaſon. This alſo ſerved the cauſe; the Diſſenters ſeized the lucky opportunity, the indignant pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners joined them, and thus formidable the preſent bill was framed, was brought in, and though oppoſed by the truly orthodox amongſt the Diſſenters, yet council was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to be heard, at leaſt ſufficient time was not given them to prepare for arguing the merits of the various petitions which have been preſented againſt it. Now, Sir, I conſider this bill in the ſame light as the petition from the club at the Feathers; the form indeed differs, the end is the ſame; and both are detrimental to the doctrinal parts of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>Nor is the thing prayed for by this bill wanting. The Diſſenters pray to be exempted from the neceſſity of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to the articles; this is required as a qualification from thoſe who commence teachers, or even ſchoolmaſters; and penal laws are now in force againſt ſuch as omit thus to qualify themſelves. But, Sir, are theſe penal laws ever put in execution? Is it not notorious, that the far greateſt part of the Diſſenters do neglect ſubſcription? And are they ever called upon? And are they ever puniſhed? What then would they have? They deſire liberty; they enjoy it
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:014092_0066_0F92DE1A8959AD40"/>
by connivance, and are now in as actual poſſeſſion of the very liberty they ſolicit for, as if their favourite bill was actually paſſed; it is abſurd, therefore, to pray for that they already poſſeſs; nor can any thing account for the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of the requeſt, but a ſuppoſition that ſome latent views, ſome het<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rodox tenets, are at the bottom of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. I will ſpeak out, Sir, I will "cry aloud and ſpare not" in a caſe of religious importance; I ſcorn to diſſemble. I ſay then, Sir, that I verily believe this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſet aſide the articles is agitated with a deſign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable to Chriſtianity. Inſtead of the articles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>eſt is propoſed, drawn up in ſuch a vague manner, and couched in ſuch general terms that a Mahometan might ſign it. The Diſſenters, Sir, are to declare that they "believe the Holy Scriptures." Pray, Sir, do not Papiſts in their ſenſe believe the Holy Scriptures? Have not Mahometans a very high opinion of Jeſus Chriſt? and do they not believe many things recorded of him in the Scriptures? They, therefore, Sir, might ſubſcribe the teſt propoſed by the bill; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever opinion I may have, the Diſſenters are good ſubjects, yet as to thoſe who declare that they can conſcientiouſly ſubſcribe only ſuch a teſt as Mah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>metans might aſſent to, I muſt be pardoned for ſaying, I think them not very good Chriſtians. To tolerate, therefore, ſuch men, Sir, is to injure the eſtabliſhed religion of our country; they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the articles, ſo they are with the doctrines which conſtitute the moſt eſſential parts of Chriſtianity. The ſacrifice of Chriſt, the oeconomy of our redemption; and in particular the divinity of our Saviour; theſe, Sir, are the ſtumbling blocks in the way of our conſcientious gentry! Yet theſe are doctrines maintained in ſcripture, and inculcated by the articles; who then can wonder, that an effort to ſet aſide the articles ſhould be made? Arians are numerous amongſt us; too many deny the divinity of him who created all things, and "without whom nothing was made that is made." A teſt requiring ſubſcription to this truth muſt be obnoxious to ſuch as diſavow it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Sir, under the notion of toleration, we muſt lend our aid to an attack upon Chriſtianity, and by paſſing this bill,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:014092_0067_0F92DE1B4D5FBC90"/>
open a paſſage for hereſies the moſt abominable, which threaten the ruin of our religious eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>Sir, in times of Heatheniſm, toleration, becauſe carried too far, became detrimental to the ſtate; Lucretius, a poe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of conſiderable genius, was permitted to broach the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm of Epicurus: his followers were as numerous as thoſe of any of our modern ſceptics; like them, Sir, he made converts; they were the wits, the beaux eſprit, the macaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of that time. [<hi>A laugh through the Houſe.</hi>] Yes, Sir, Gentlemen may laugh, but the Atheiſts of old, were like the ſceptics of modern times; they were occaſional confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, and, by being tolerated, they gained proſelytes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and tore up the foundations of morality by the roots; they broached their curſed opinions, and infected the minds of the people.</p>
               <p>In remoter times, Sir, we find, indeed, atheiſtical ſceptics, though from not being tolerated they were reſtrained from doing the miſchief they intended. Epicurus was not the firſt ſceptic; in the times of David and Solomon the ſect prevailed. The former King, who was a poet alſo, tel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>that there is no God.</hi> In David's days, Sir, though perſecution prevailed not., yet the ſceptics were not allowed to debauch the minds of their fellow creatures, by obliging the world with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>efarious opinions. Yet a toleration of this kind is now ſolicited. But whether we are to ſhew ourſelves ſo unmindful of our duty as to grant the requeſt, this day's debate will diſcover. I, Sir, have borne my teſtimony againſt the bill; I do it conſcienciouſly; I do it with ſerious reverence; my ſincerity has, during the courſe of the debate on this ſubject, been called in queſtion; and I could, perhaps, with much greater propriety, retort, by queſtioning the ſincerity of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of this bill; I have a right, Sir, ſo to do; and I will ſay, that the ſincerity of the advocates for this bill ſtands in need of ſtrong poſitive proofs; the preſumptive is againſt them.</p>
               <p>I am ſure, Sir, I ought to aſk pardon of this Houſe for detaining in thus long, and I cannot ſufficiently expreſs my
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:014092_0068_0F92DE1D53023218"/>
thankfulneſs for the indulgence which has been ſhewn me. I ſhall treſpaſs no longer upon your time than to ſay, Sir, that I am againſt your quitting the chair.</p>

               <p>I THINK, Sir, after the learned manner in which my honourable friend has argued the matter, little remains to be ſaid. I entirely coincide with him in opinion; and the diviſion amongſt the Diſſenters themſelves ſhews that in numbers the advocates for the bill are as inconſiderable as they are far from being unanimous. The Chatham petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may convince us of the want of unanimity which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, and I am glad to find that we are indebted to the lines of Chatham for a ſupport of orthodox Chriſtianity.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>MR. EDMUND BURKE.</head>
               <p>THE Honourable Gentleman who favoured us laſt but one with his favourite harangue, had little reaſon to apprehend that I ſhould engage him in a war about parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Whether the Houſe <hi>might, could, ſhould,</hi> or <hi>ought,</hi> to interfere, I leave to be diſcuſſed by more grammatical heads. Neither, Sir, ſhall I rejoice, with the honourable gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who ſpoke laſt, at the "ſupport the lines of Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham have afforded to orthodox Chriſtianity." "Whether the walls have defended the lines, or the lines have afforded defence to the walls, is altogether foreign to the debate in queſtion; but this, Sir, I ſhall take upon me peremptorily to aſſert, that if the objections to the bill are founded upon thoſe two contemptible petitions [that from Chatham and another] which now lie on the table, if they are to furniſh the oppoſers with weapons wherewith to attack the meaſure, I fear the combatants muſt take the field accoutred by no means in a martial manner.</p>
               <p>I propoſe, Sir, taking notice of what fell from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable gentleman's lips [Sir William Bagot's] conſidered in a twofold view. He advanced the following poſitions,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:014092_0069_0F92DE1D892A9690"/>
"that the Diſſenters now enjoyed liberty by connivance." and "that toleration was an attack upon Chriſtianity." The honourable gentleman to be ſure has treated his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in a maſterly manner, and hath diſplayed a profuſion of learning; but whether he hath not been too laviſh of his erudition, conſidering the abſurdity of the poſitions, will appear by more fully conſidering the ſubject. The Diſſenters enjoy liberty by connivance! My God, Sir, what ſort of liberty is this? A writer [Mr. Hume] whoſe name hath lately been made free with in this Houſe, he, Sir, compares tyranny to a thunder ſtorm or volcano, each moment gathering, and certain at ſome period to burſt forth and ſcatter deſtruction on all within its reach. What, Sir, is liberty by connivance, but a temporary relaxation of ſlavery? is this a ſort of liberty calculated for the meredian of England? Monteſquieu places liberty in an exemption from fear: Are perſons who enjoy it by connivance only, are they exempt from fears and diveſted of apprehenſions? the very bill before us demonſtrates the contrary. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Diſſenters do now enjoy a fort of liberty by connivance, a liberty which hath this for its dependence is precarious, may exiſt to day and be annihilated to-morrow; it therefore creates alarms in the minds of men, and makes them apply, as in the caſe before us, for a confirmation and eſtabliſhment of that, the precarious tenure of which renders the continuance of the poſſeſſion uncertain.</p>
               <p>To talk then, Sir, of a connivance, is to talk only of a temporary ſuſpenſion of tyranny. You are deſirous to keep the rod hanging over the Diſſenters heads at the very inſtant that you aſſure them they ſhall never ſmart under its ſtripes. Why then, at once not ſet their hearts at reſt by removing the impending danger? Why not releaſe them from the dread of theſe penal ſtatutes, the cruelty of which ſo ſhocks your generous natures, that you think it incumbent on you to declare they never ſhould be put into execution? The queſtion, Sir anſwers itſelf; and to cavil at it's propriety, is to carp at truth and elude conviction.</p>
               <p>Much has been urged reſpecting the want of unanimity among the Diſſenters; but I, Sir, ſhould apprehend, that
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:014092_0070_0F92DE1E46AE2CB0"/>
the reaſonableneſs of a requeſt, and not the numbers who prefer it, is the thing which ought to determine this Houſe in its proceedings and reſolves: For, my God! Sir, how can the opinions of thoſe who petition militate with any ſort of propriety againſt the bill? Two bodies of men approach the Houſe, and proſtrate themſelves at your bar; we cannot in conſcience, ſay the one, agree to the teſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; we aſk not honours; we have no aſpiring wiſhes; no views upon the purple; the Mitre has no charms for us; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

We on the contrary, ſay the men who petition againſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, we enjoy every ſpecies of indulgence we can wiſh for; and as we are content, we pray that others, who are not content, may meet with no relief! What, Sir, ſhall we ſay to theſe reptiles? what but <hi>arangez-vous, canaille!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Great pains, Sir, have been taken to make us believe that the clergy of the eſtabliſhed church are alarmed; but what ſigns of ſuch alarm have appeared? hath either of the Univerſities oppoſed this bill? have the church dignitaries petitioned againſt it? no, Sir; as men, they hold the rights of humanity too dear; and, as Chriſtians, they breathe a ſpirit too tolerant, not to wiſh a total abolition of the reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of eccleſiaſtic tyranny. Are we then to be diſſuaded from granting relief, becauſe a petition comes dated from the lines of Chatham? I ſhould bluſh to ſee ſuch a production quoted as authority by which Britiſh Senators were guided in their deciſions.</p>
               <p>As to what the honourable gentleman [Sir William Bagot] let fail concerning "Toleration being an attack upon Chriſtianity." it is an aſſertion ſo contrary to truth and hiſtory, that it ſcarcely ſtands in need of refutation. By toleration Chriſtianity flouriſhed: whilſt the eaſtern and weſtern churches were tolerant they were illuſtrious; they
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:014092_0071_0F92DE1F08374D50"/>
were venerated; they were held in ſacred eſtimation. When the Romiſh church caſt aſide its toleration, and betook itſelf to threatnings, ſlaughter, and perſecution, commotions enſued; eccleſiaſtical anarchy prevailed; and the kingdom of darkneſs was erected on the ruins of Chriſtian Charity and mutual forbearance: inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the common foe, Chriſtians fought and combated each other; inſtead of taking arms againſt the grand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, they ſtrove, by every deceptious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>t, to harraſs and torment thoſe whom they ought to have lived as brethren. In ſhort, Sir, the want of toleration has leſſened the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of believers; I would have them all united: that they might be the better enabled to make a common cauſe, and put infidels to a total rout. Theſe, Sir, are the men; theſe ſcepti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> their broad pinions, whilſt you tear piece-meal the ſilken wings of ſome feeble, harmleſs inſect who falls into your clutches! Away, Sir, with ſuch abſurdity! the ſceptics, who labour to degrade us below brutes: the ſceptics who would fain perſuade us that we are inferior to thoſe animals that wallow in a ſtye; the ſceptics, who ſap the foundation of all morality and ſocial virtue; who daringly attempt to plunder us of the deareſt privilege annexed to manhood, that of being of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious animal; the ſceptics, who, by rediculing revelation, ſet at nought the various diſpenſations of the godhead to his creature man. Theſe, Sir, are the Pythons againſt whom Chriſtians ſhould be armed; but amongſt themſelves toleration cannot be carried to too great a length; nor is there any danger that Chriſtianity ſhould ſuffer by ſuch a toleration. Aſk you what is leſt to defend it? I anſwer, the ſtrongeſt defence imaginable; the learning, the wit, and the genius of its advocates. To whom has chriſtianity been moſt indebted for the completeſt victory it ever gained over the whole body of deiſtical writers? to a man who never did nor I am ſure never would have ſubſcribed the articles. The learned writer I allude to is Dr. Leland, who, in his "view of the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="72" facs="unknown:014092_0072_0F92DE1FCF1BCC40"/>
chriſtianity an eſſential ſervice (if ſo divine a ſyſtem could receive aſſiſtance from mortal hands.)</p>
               <p>As to the toleration afforded by Heatheniſm, I am yet to learn that it went ſo far as the honourable gentleman ſeems to think, for thoſe who were admitted within the pale of the Heathen church were at leaſt required to aſſiſt in the performance of the religious rites, thoſe to Bacchus and ſome others. Such a conformity was neceſſary, and, perhaps, in every eſtabliſhment it is the only conformity the Magiſtrate has a right to exact, for I take the reverſe of our mode of proceeding to be the juſt one; the conſtraint ſhould be put not ſo much upon the doctrinal as the ritual part of the religion, a conformity in the latter being the chief thing requiſite for the ſupport of a religious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment connected with the ſtate. But, Sir, the toleration the learned gentleman ſpeaks of as exerciſed towards the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans, proves nothing to the purpoſe; for being athe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I truſt, Sir, I am penetrated with as deep a ſenſe of the benefits derived to us by the birth of a Saviour, as any man within theſe walls; I truſt, I would go as far as any man in maintaining the eſſential articles of chriſtani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I alſo fancy, Sir, the church of England has not a firmer friend than myſelf.
