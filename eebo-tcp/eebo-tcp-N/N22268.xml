            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>"WHEN once ſordid intereſt ſeizes on the heart, it freezes up the ſource of every warm and liberal feeling; it is an enemy alike to virtue and to taſte—<hi>this</hi> it perverts, and <hi>that</hi> it annihilates. The time may come, my friend, when death ſhall diſſolve the ſinews of avarice, and juſtice be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to reſume her rights."</p>
                     <p>Such were the words of the Advocate Nemours to Pierre de la Motte, as the latter ſtept at midnight into the carriage which was to bear him far from Paris, from his creditors and the perſecution of the laws. De la Motte thanked him for this laſt inſtance of his kindneſs; the aſſiſtance he had given him in eſcape; and, when the carriage drove away, uttered a ſad adieu! The gloom of the hour, and the peculiar emergency of his circumſtances, ſunk him in ſilent reverie.</p>
                     <p>Whoever has read Guyot de Pitavel, the moſt faithful of thoſe writers who record the proceedings in the Parliamentary Courts of Paris, during the ſeventeenth century, muſt ſurely, remember the ſtriking ſtory of Pierre de la Motte, and the Marquis Phillipe de Montalt: let all ſuch therefore, be informed, that the perſon here introduced to their notice was that indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Pierre de la Motte.</p>

                        <pb n="4" facs="unknown:029379_0003_0FE0891E2FAE3CE0"/>As Madame de la Motte leaned from the coach window, and gave a laſt look to the walls of Paris—Paris, the ſcene of her former happineſs, and the reſidence of many dear friends— the fortitude, which had till now ſupported her, yielded to the force of grief. "Farewell all!" ſighed ſhe, "this laſt look and we are ſeparated for ever!" Tears followed her words, and, ſinking back, ſhe reſigned herſelf to the ſtillneſs of ſorrow. The recollection of former times preſſed heavily upon her heart: a few months before and ſhe was ſurrounded by friends, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and conſequence; now ſhe was deprived of all, a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exile from her native place, without home, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort—almoſt without hope. It was not the leaſt of her afflictions, that ſhe had been obliged to quit Paris, without bidding adieu to her only ſon, who was now on duty with his regiment in Germany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch had been the precipitancy of this removal, that had ſhe even known where he was ſtationed, ſhe had no time to inform him of it, or of the alteration in his father's circumſtance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Pierre de la Motte was a gentleman, deſcended from an ancient houſe of France. He was a man whoſe paſſions often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rcame his reaſon, and, for a time, ſilenced his conſcience; but, though the image of virtue, which Nature had impreſſed upon his heart, was ſometimes obſcured by the paſſing influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of vice, it was never wholly obliterated. With ſtrength of mind ſufficient to have withſtood temptation, he would have been a good man; as it was, he was always a weak, and ſometimes a vicious member of ſociety: yet his mind was active, and his imagination vivid, which, co-operating with the force of paſſion, often dazzled his judgment and ſubdued principle. Thus he was a man, infirm in purpoſe and viſionary in virtue: in a word, his conduct was ſuggeſted by feeling, rather than principle; and his virtue, ſuch as it was, could not ſtand the preſſure of occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Early in life he had married Conſtance Valentia, a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and elegant woman, attached to her family, and beloved by them. Her birth was equal, her fortune ſuperior to his; and their nuptials had been celebrated under the auſpices of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and flattering world. Her heart was devoted to La Motte, and, for ſome time, ſhe found in him an affectionate huſband; but allured by the gaieties of Paris, he was ſoon devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to its luxuries, and in a few years his fortune and affection were equally loſt in diſſipation. A falſe pride had ſtill ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt his intereſt, and withheld him from honourable
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:029379_0003_0FE0891E2FAE3CE0"/>
retreat while it was yet in his power: the habits, which he had acquired, enchained him to the ſcene of his former pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure; and thus he had continued an expenſive ſtile of life till the means of prolonging it were exhauſted. He at length awoke from his lethargy of ſecurity; but it was only to plunge into new error, and to attempt ſchemes for the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his fortune, which ſerved to ſink him deeper in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction. The conſequence of a tranſaction, in which he thus engaged, now drove him with the ſmall wreck of his property, into dangerous and ignominious exile.</p>
                     <p>It was his deſign to paſs into one of the Southern Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and there ſeek, near the borders of the kingdom, an aſylum in ſome obſcure village. His family conſiſted of his wife, and two faithful domeſtics, a man and woman, who followed the fortunes of their maſter.</p>
                     <p>The night was dark and tempeſtuous, and, at about the diſtance of three leagues from Paris, Peter, who now acted as poſtillion, having drove for ſome time over a wild heath where many ways croſſed, ſtopped, and acquainted De la Motte with his perplexity. The ſudden ſtopping of the carriage rouſed the latter from his reverie, and filled the whole party with the terror of purſuit; he was unable to ſupply the neceſſary direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the extreme darkneſs made it dangerous to proceed without one. During this period of diſtreſs, a light was perceived at ſome diſtance, and after much doubt and heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, La Motte, in the hope of obtaining aſſiſtance, alighted and advanced towards it; he proceeded ſlowly, from the fear of unknown pits. The light iſſued from the window of a ſmall and ancient houſe, which ſtood alone on the heath, at the diſtance of half a mile.</p>
                     <p>Having reached the door, he ſtopped for ſome moments, liſtening in apprehenſive anxiety—no ſound was heard but that of the wind, which ſwept in hollow guſts over the waſte. At length he ventured to knock, and, having waited ſome time, during which he indiſtinctly heard ſeveral voices in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ſome one within enquired what he wanted? La Motte anſwered, that he was a traveller who had loſt his way, and deſired to be directed to the neareſt town. "That," ſaid the perſon, "is ſeven miles off and the road bad enough, even if you could ſee it: if you only want a bed, you may have it here, and had better ſtay."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="unknown:029379_0004_0FE089296C08B868"/>The "pitileſs pelting" of the ſtorm, which at this time, beat with encreaſing fury upon La Motte, inclined him to give up the attempt of proceeding farther till day-light; but deſirous of ſeeing the perſon with whom he converſed, before he ventured to expoſe his family by calling up the carriage, he aſked to be admitted. The door was now opened by a tall figure with a light, who invited La Motte to enter. He followed the man through a paſſage into a room almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed, in one corner of which a bed was ſpread upon the floor. The forlorn and deſolate aſpect of this apartment made La Motte ſhrink involuntarily, and he was turning to go out, when the man ſuddenly puſhed him back, and he heard the door locked upon him: his heart failed, yet he made a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, though vain, effort to force the door, and called loudly for releaſe. No anſwer was returned; but he diſtinguiſhed the voices of men in the room above, and, not doubting but their intention was to rob and murder him, his agitation, at firſt, overcame his reaſon. By the light of ſome almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring embers, he perceived a window, but the hope, which this diſcovery, revived, was quickly loſt, when he found the aperture guarded by ſtrong iron bars. Such preparation for ſecurity ſurpriſed him, and confirmed his worſt apprehenſions. Alone, unarmed—beyond the chance of aſſiſtance, he ſaw himſelf in the power of people, whoſe trade was apparently rapine!—murder their means!—After revolving every poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of eſcape, he endeavoured to await the event with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; but La Motte could boaſt of no ſuch virtue.</p>
                     <p>The voices had ceaſed, and all remained ſtill for a quarter of an hour, when, between the pauſes of the wind he thought he diſtinguiſhed the ſobs and moaning of a female; he liſtened attentively and became confirmed in his conjecture; it was too evidently the accent of diſtreſs. At this conviction, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his courage forſook him, and a terrible ſurmiſe darted, with the rapidity of lightning, croſs his brain. It was probable that his carriage had been diſcovered by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the houſe, who, with a deſign of plunder, had ſecured his ſervant, and brought hither Mademe de la Motte. He was the more inclined to believe this, by the ſtillneſs which had, for ſome time, reigned in the houſe, previous to the ſound he now heard. Or it was poſſible that the inhabitants were not robbers, but perſons to whom he had been betrayed by his friend or ſervant, and who were appointed to deliver him into the hands of juſtice. Yet he hardly da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed to doubt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029379_0004_0FE089296C08B868"/>
the integrity of his friend, who had been entruſted with the ſecret of his flight and the plan of his route, and had procured him the carriage in which he had eſcaped. "Such depravity," exclaimed La Motte, "cannot ſurely exiſt in human nature; much leſs in the heart of Nemours!"</p>
                     <p>This ejaculation was interrupted by a noiſe in the paſſage leading to the room: it approached—the door was unlocked —and the man who had admitted La Motte into the houſe; entered leading, or rather forcibly dragging along, a beautiful girl, who appeared to be about eighteen. Her features were bathed in tears, and ſhe ſeemed to ſuffer the utmoſt diſtreſs, The man faſtened the lock and put the key in his pocket. He then advanced to La Motte, who had before obſerved other perſons in the paſſage, and pointed a piſtol to his breaſt, "You are wholly in our power," ſaid he, "no aſſiſtance can reach you: if you wiſh to ſave your life, ſwear that you will convey this girl where I may never ſee her more; or rather conſent to take her with you, for your oath I would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and I can take care you ſhall not find me again.—Anſwer quickly, you have no time to loſe."</p>
                     <p>He now ſeized the trembling hand of the girl, who ſhrunk aghaſt with terror, and hurried her towards La Motte, whom ſurpriſe ſtill kept ſilent. She ſunk at his feet, and with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating eyes, that ſtreamed with tears, implored him to have pity on her. Notwithſtanding his preſent agitation, he found it impoſſible to contemplate the beauty and diſtreſs of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before him with indifference. Her youth, her apparent innocence—the artleſs energy of her manner forcibly aſſailed his heart, and he was going to ſpeak, when the ruffian, who miſtook the ſilence of aſtoniſhment for that of heſitation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him. "I have a horſe ready to take you from hence," ſaid he, "and I will direct you over the heath. If you return within an hour, you die: after then you are at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to come here when you pleaſe."</p>
                     <p>La Motte, without anſwering, raiſed the lovely girl from the floor, and was ſo much relieved from his own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that he had leiſure to attempt diſſipating hers. "Let us be gone," ſaid the ruffian, "and have no more of this nonſenſe; you may think yourſelf well off it's no worſe. I'll go and get the horſe ready."</p>
                     <p>The laſt words rouſed La Motte, and perplexed him with new fears; he dreaded to diſcover his carriage, loſt its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance might tempt the banditti to plunder; and to depart
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029379_0005_0FE0892F0A64F320"/>
on horſeback with this man might produce a conſequence yet more to be dreaded. Madame La Motte, wearied with apprehenſion, would, probably, ſend for her huſband to the houſe, when all the former danger would be incurred, with the additional evil of being ſeparated from his family, and the chance of being detected by the emiſſaries of juſtice in endeavouring to recover them. As theſe reflections paſſed over his mind in tumultuous rapidity, a noiſe was again heard in the paſſage, an uproar and ſcuffle enſued, and in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he could diſtinguiſh the voice of his ſervant, who had been ſent by Madame La Motte in ſearch of him. Being now determined to diſcloſe what could not long be concealed, he exclaimed aloud that a horſe was unneceſſary, that he had a carriage at ſome diſtance which would convey them from the heath, the man, who was ſeized, being his ſervant.</p>
                     <p>The ruffian, ſpeaking through the door, bid him be patient awhile and he ſhould hear more from him. La Motte now turned his eyes upon his unfortunate companion, who, pale and exhauſted, leaned for ſupport againſt the wall. Her features, which were delicately beautiful, had gained from diſtreſs an expreſſion of captivating ſweetneſs: ſhe had

A habit of grey camlet, with ſhort ſlaſhed ſleeves, ſhewed, but did not adorn, her figure: it was thrown open at the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, upon which part of her, hair had fallen in diſorder, while the light veil haſtily thrown on, had, in her confuſion, been ſuffered to fall back. Every moment of farther obſervation heightened the ſurpriſe of La Motte, and intereſted him more warmly in her favour. Such eleg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>lation of the houſe, and the ſavage manners of its inhabitants, ſeemed to him like a romance of imagination, rather than an occurrence of real life. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to comfort her, and his ſenſe of compaſſion was too ſincere to be miſunderſtood. Her terror gradually ſubſided into gratitude and grief. "Ah, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "Heaven has ſent you to my relief, and will ſurely reward you for your protection: I have no friend in the world, if I do not find one in you."</p>
                     <p>La Motte aſſured her of his kindneſs, when he was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the entrance of the ruffian. He deſired to be conducted to his family. "All in good time," replied the latter; "I
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029379_0005_0FE0892F0A64F320"/>
have taken care of one of them, and will of you, pleaſe St. Peter; ſo be comforted." Theſe <hi>comfortable</hi> words renewed the terror of La Motte, who now earneſtly begged to know if his family were ſafe. "O! as for that matter they are ſafe enough and you will be with them preſently; but don't ſtand <hi>parlying</hi> here all night Do you chuſe to go or ſtay? You know the conditions." They now bound the eyes of La Motte and of the young lady, whom terror had hitherto kept ſilent, and then placing them on two horſes, a man mounted behind each, and they immediately galloped off. They had proceeded in this was near half an hour, when La Motte entreated to know whither he was going? "You will know that bye and bye," ſaid the ruffian, "ſo be at peace." Finding inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories uſeleſs, La Motte reſumed ſilence till the horſes ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. His conductor then hallooed, and being anſwered by voices at ſome diſtance, in a few moments the ſound of carriage wheels was heard, and, preſently after, the words of a man directing Peter which way to drive. As the carriage ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, La Motte called, and to his inexpreſſible joy, was anſwered by his wife.</p>
                     <p>"You are now beyond the borders of the heath, and may go which way you will," ſaid the ruffian; "if you return within an hour, "you will be welcomed by a brace of bullets." This was a very unneceſſary caution to La Motte, whom they now releaſed. The young ſtranger ſighed deeply, as ſhe entered the carriage; and the ruffian, having beſtowed upon Peter ſome directions and more threats, waited to ſee him drive off. They did not wait long.</p>
                     <p>La Motte immediately gave a ſhort relation of what had paſſed at the houſe, including an account of the manner in which the young ſtranger had been introduced to him. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this narrative, her deep convulſive ſighs frequently drew the attention of Madame La Motte, whoſe compaſſion became gradually intereſted in her behalf, and who now endeavoured to tranquillize her ſpirits. The unhappy girl anſwered her kindneſs in articles and ſimple expreſſions, and then relapſed into tears and ſilence. Madame forbore for the preſent to aſk any queſtions that night lead to a diſcovery of her connections, or ſeem to require an explanation of the late adventure, which now furniſhing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029379_0006_0FE0893E04FB48A8"/>
one of thoſe improbable fictions that ſometimes are exhibited in a romance: he could reduce it to no principles of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, or render it comprehenſible by any endeavour to ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize it. The preſent charge, and the chance of future trouble brought upon him or this adventure, occaſioned ſome diſſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction; but the beauty and ſeeming innocence of Adeline, united with the pleadings of humanity in her favour, and he determined to protect her.</p>

                     <p>Diſmally and ſilently the night paſſed on, for the minds of the travellers were too much occupied by their ſeveral ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to admit of converſation. The dawn ſo anxiouſly watched for, at length appeared and introduced the ſtrangers more fully to each other. Adeline derived comfort from the looks of Madame La Motte, who gazed frequently and attentively at her, and thought ſhe had ſeldom ſeen a countenance ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting, or a form ſo ſtriking. The languor of ſorrow threw a melancholy grace upon her features, that appealed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the heart; and there was a penetrating ſweetneſs in her blue eyes, which indicated an intelligent and amiable mind.</p>
                     <p>La Motte now looked anxiouſly from the coach window, that he might judge of their ſituation, and obſerve whether he was followed. The obſcurity of the dawn confined his views, but no perſon appeared. The ſun at length tinted the eaſtern clouds and the tops of the higheſt hills, and ſoon after burſt in full ſplendour on the ſcene. The terror of La Motte began to ſubſide, and the griefs of Adeline to ſoften. They entered upon a lane confined by high banks and over-arched by trees, on whoſe branches appeared the firſt green buds of ſpring glittering with dews. The freſh breeze of the morning ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the ſpirits of Adeline, whoſe mind was delicately ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the beauties of nature. As ſhe viewed the flowery luxuriance of the turf, and the tender green of the trees, or caught, between the opening banks, a glimpſe of the varied landſcape, rich with wood, and fading into the blue and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant mountains, her heart expanded in momentary joy. With Adeline the charms of external nature were heightened by thoſe of novelty: ſhe had ſeldom ſeen the grandeur of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

proſpect, or the magnificence of a wide horrizon—and not often the pictureſque beauties of more confined ſcenery. Her mind had not loſt by long oppreſſion that elaſtic energy, which reſiſts calamity; elſe, however ſuſceptible might have been her original taſte, the beauties of nature would no longer have charmed her thus eaſily even to temporary repoſe.</p>
                     <p>The road at length, wound down the ſide of a hill, and La Motte, again looking anxiouſly from the window, ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him an open champaign country, through which the road, wholly unſheltered from obſervation, extended almoſt in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect line. The danger of theſe circumſtances alarmed him, for his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight might without difficulty be traced for many leagues from the hills he was now deſcending. Of the firſt peaſant that paſſed, he enquired for a road among the hills, but heard of none. La Motte now ſunk into his former ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. Madame, notwithſtanding her own apprehenſions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to re-aſſure him, but finding her efforts ineffectual, ſhe alſo retired to the contemplation of her misfortunes. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, as they went on, did La Motte look back upon the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try they had paſſed, and often did imagination ſuggeſt to him the ſounds of diſtant purſuits.</p>
                     <p>The travellers ſtopped to breakfaſt in a village, where the road was at length obſcured by woods, and La Motte's ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its again revived. Adeline appeared more tranquil than ſhe had yet been, and La Motte now aſked for an explanation of the ſcene he had witneſſed on the preceeding night. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry renewed all her diſtreſs, and with tears ſhe entreated for the preſent to be ſpared on the ſubject. La Motte preſſed it no farther, but he obſerved that for the greater part of the day ſhe ſeemed to remember it in melancholy and dejection. They now travelled among the hills and were, therefore, in leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of obſervation; but La Motte avoided the great towns, and ſtopped in obſcure ones, no longer than to refreſh the horſes. About two hours after noon, the road wound into a deep valley, watered by a rivulet, and over-hung with wood. La Motte called to Peter, and ordered him to drive to a thickly embowered ſpot, that appeared on the left. Here he alighted with his family, and Peter having ſpread the proviſions on the turf, they ſeated themſelves and partook of the repaſt, which, in other circumſtances, would have been thought delicious. Adeline endeavoured to ſmile, but the languor of grief was now heightened by indiſpoſition. The violent agitation of mind, and fatigue of body, which ſhe had ſuffered for the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029379_0007_0FE089429CE1D068"/>
laſt twenty-four hours, had overpowered her ſtrength, and, when La Motte led her back to the carriage, her whole frame trembled with illneſs. But ſhe uttered no complaint, and, having long obſerved the dejection of her companions, ſhe made a feeble effort to enliven them.</p>
                     <p>They continued to travel throughout the day without any accident or interruption, and, about three hours after ſunſet, arrived at Monville, a ſmall town where La Motte determined to paſs the night. Repoſe was, indeed neceſſary to the whole party, whoſe pale and haggered looks, as they alighted from the carriage, were but too obvious to paſs unobſerved by the people of the inn. As ſoon as the beds could be prepared Adeline withdrew to her chamber, accompanied by Madam La Motte, whoſe concern for the fair ſtranger made her exert every effort to ſoothe and conſole her. Adeline wept in ſilence, and taking the hand of Madame, preſſed it to her boſom. Theſe were not merely tears of grief—they were mingled with thoſe which flow from the grateful heart, when unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly, it meets with ſympathy. Madame La Motte under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood them. After ſome momentary ſilence ſhe renewed her aſſurances of kindneſs, and entreated Adeline to confide in her friendſhip; but ſhe carefully avoided any mention of the ſubject, which had before ſo much affected her. Adeline at length found words to expreſs her ſenſe of this goodneſs, which ſhe did in a manner ſo natural and ſincere, that Madame, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf much affected, took leave of her for the night.</p>
                     <p>In the Morning, La Motte roſe at an early hour, impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to be gone. Every thing was prepared for his departure, and the breakfaſt had been waiting ſome time, but Adeline did not appear. Madame La Motte went to her chamber, and found her ſunk in a diſturbed ſlumber. Her breathing was ſhort and irregular—ſhe frequently ſtarted, or ſighed, and ſometimes ſhe muttered an incoherent ſentence. While Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame gazed with concern upon her languid countenance, ſhe awoke, and looking up, gave her hand to Madame La Motte, who found it burning with fever. She had paſſed a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He ſaw all the inconvenience and danger of delay, yet he could not ſo far diveſt himſelf of humanity, as to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Adeline to the care, or rather to the neglect of ſtrangers. He ſent immediately for a phyſician, who pronounced her to be in a high fever, and ſaid, a removal in her preſent ſtate muſt be fatal. La Motte now determined to wait the event, and endeavoured to calm the tranſports of terror, which at times, aſſailed him. In the mean while he took ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions as his ſituation admitted of, paſſing the greater part of the day out of the village, in a ſpot from whence he had a view of the road for ſome diſtance; yet to be expoſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction by the illneſs of a girl, whom he did not know, and who had actually been forced upon him, was a misfortune, to which La Motte had not philoſophy enough to ſubmit with compoſure.</p>
                     <p>Adeline's fever continued to encreaſe during the whole day, and at night, when the phyſician took his leave, he told La Motte, the event would very ſoon be decided. La Motte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this intelligence with real concern. The beauty and innocence of Adeline had overcome the diſadvantageous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances under which ſhe had been introduced to him, and he now gave leſs conſideration to the inconvenience ſhe might hereafter occaſion him, than to the hope of her recovery.</p>
                     <p>Madame La Motte watched over her with tender anxiety, and obſerved with admiration her patient ſweetneſs and mild reſignation. Adeline amply rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>id her, though ſhe thought ſhe could not. "Young as I am," ſhe would ſay "and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by thoſe upon whom I have a claim for protection, I can remember no connection to make me regret life ſo much as that I hoped to form with you. If I live, my conduct will beſt expreſs my ſenſe of your goodneſs;—words are but feeble teſtimonies."</p>
                     <p>The ſweetneſs of her manners ſo much attracted Madame La Motte, that ſhe watched the criſis of her diſorder, with a ſolicitude which precluded every other intereſt. Adeline paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a very diſturbed night, and when the phyſician appeared in the morning, he gave orders that ſhe ſhould be indulged with whatever ſhe liked, and anſwered the inquiries of La Motte with a frankneſs that left him nothing to hope.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, his patient, after drinking profuſely of ſome mild liquids, fell aſleep, in which ſhe continued for ſeveral hours, and ſo profound was her ropoſe, that her breath
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029379_0008_0FE08867F5235908"/>
alone gave ſign of exiſtence. She awoke free from fever and with no other diſorder than weakneſs, which, in a few days, ſhe overcame ſo well, as to be able to ſet out with La Motte for B—, a village out of the great road, which he thought it prudent to quit. There they paſſed the following night, and early the next morning commenced their journey upon a wild and woody tract of country. They ſtopped about noon at a ſolitary village, where they took refreſhments, and obtained di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for paſſing the vaſt foreſt of Fontanville, upon the borders of which they now were. La Motte wiſhed at firſt to take a guide, but he apprehended more evil from the diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery he might make of his route, than he hoped for benefit from aſſiſtance in the wilds of this uncultivated tract.</p>
                     <p>La Motte now deſigned to paſs on to Lyons, where he could either ſeek concealment in its neighbourhood, or embark on the Rhone for Geneva, ſhould the emergency of his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances hereafter require him to leave France. It was about twelve o'clock at noon, and he was deſirous to haſten forward, that he might paſs the foreſt of Fontanville, and reach the town on its oppoſite borders, before night-fall. Having depoſited a freſh ſtock of proviſions in the carriage, and received ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as were neceſſary concerning the roads, they again ſet forward, and in a ſhort time entered upon the foreſt. It was now the latter end of April, and the weather was remarkably temperate and fine. The balmy freſhneſs of the air, which breathed the firſt pure eſſence of vegetation; and the gentle warmth of the ſun, whoſe beams vivified every hue of nature, and opened every floweret of ſpring, revived Adeline, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired her with life and health. As ſhe inhaled the breeze, her ſtrength ſeemed to return, and as her eyes wandered through the romantic glades that opened into the foreſt, her heart was gladdened with complacent delight: but when from theſe objects ſhe turned her regard upon Monſieur and Madame La Motte, to whoſe tender attentions ſhe owed her life, and in whoſe looks ſhe now read eſteem and kindneſs, her boſom glowed with ſweet affections, and ſhe experienced a force of gratitude which might be called ſublime.</p>
                     <p>For the remainder of the day they continued to travel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was now near ſun-ſet, and the proſpect being cloſed on all ſides by the foreſt, La Motte began to have apprehenſions that his ſervant had miſtaken the way. The road, if a road it could be called, which afforded only a ſlight track upon the graſs, was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029379_0008_0FE08867F5235908"/>
over-run by luxuriant vegetation, and ſometimes obſcured by the deep ſhades, and Peter at length ſtopped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of the way. La Motte, who dreaded being benighted in a ſcene ſo wild and ſolitary as this foreſt, and whoſe apprehenſions of banditti were very ſanguine, ordered him to proceed at any rate, and, if he found no track, to endeavour to gain a more open part of the foreſt. With theſe orders, Peter again ſet forwards, but having proceeded ſome way, and his views being ſtill confined by woody glades and foreſt walks, he began to deſpair of extricating himſelf, and ſtopped for further orders. The ſun was now ſet, but as La Motte looked-anxiouſly from the window, he obſerved upon the viv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id glow of the weſtern horizon, ſome dark towers riſing from among the trees at a little diſtance, and ordered Peter to drive towards them. "If they belong to monaſtery," ſaid he, "we may probably gain admittance for the night."</p>
                     <p>The carrirge drove along under the ſhade of "melancholy boughs," through which the evening twilight, which yet coloured the air, diffuſed a ſolemnity that vibrated in thrilling ſenſations upon the hearts of the travellers. Expectation kept them ſilent. The preſent ſcene recalled to Adeline a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the late terriffic circumſtances, and her mind reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded but too eaſily to the apprehenſion of new misfortunes. La Motte alighted at the foot of a green knoll, where the trees again opening to light, permitted a nearer, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect view of the edifice.</p>

                        </gap>reathed with ivy, were half demoliſhed, and become the reſidence of birds of prey. Huge fragments of the eaſtern tower, which was almoſt demoliſhed, lay ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered amid the high graſs, that waved ſlowly to the breeze. "The thriſtle ſhook its lonely head; the moſs whiſtled to the wind." A Gothic gate, richly ornamented with fret-work, which opened into the main body of the edifice, but which was now obſtructed with bruſh-wood, remained entire. Above the vaſt and magnificent portal of this gate aroſe a window of the ſame order, whoſe pointed arches ſtill exhibited fragments of ſtained glaſs, once the pride of monkiſh devotion. La Motte, thinking it poſſible it might yet ſhelter ſome hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being, advanced to the gate and lifted a maſſy knocker. The hollow ſound rung through the emptineſs of the place. After waiting a few minutes, he forced back the gate, which was heavy with iron work, and creaked harſhly on its hinges.</p>
                     <p>He entered what appeared to have been the chapel of the abbey, where the hymn of devotion had once been raiſed, and the tear of penitence had once been ſhed; ſounds which could now only be recalled by imagination—tears of penitence, which had been long ſince fixed in fate. La Mote pauſed a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029379_0009_0FE08956161B58F8"/>
moment, for he felt a ſenſation of ſublimity riſing into terror— a ſuſpenſion of mingled aſtoniſhment and awe! He ſurveyed the vaſtneſs of the place, and as he contemplated its ruins, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy bore him back to paſt ages. "And theſe walls," ſaid he, "where once ſuperſtition lurked, and auſterity anticipated an earthly purgatory, now tremble over the mortal remains of the beings who reared them!"</p>
                     <p>The deepening gloom now reminded La Motte that he had no time to loſe, but curioſity prompted him to explore far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he obeyed the impulſe. As he walked over the broken pavement, the ſound of his ſteps ran in echoes through the place, and ſeemed like the myſterious accents of the dead, reproving the ſacrilegious mortal who thus dared to diſturb their precincts.</p>
                     <p>From this chappel he paſſed into the nave of the great church, of which one window more perfect than the reſt, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened upon a long viſta of the foreſt, through which was ſeen the rich colouring of evening, melting by imperceptible gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations into the ſolemn grey of upper air. Dark hills, whoſe outline appeared diſtinct upon the vivid glow of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izon, cloſed the perſpective. Several of the pillars, which had once ſupported the roof, remained the proud effigies of ſinking greatneſs, and ſeemed to nod at every murmur of the blaſt over the fragments of thoſe that had fallen a little before them. La Motte ſighed. The compariſon between himſelf and the gradation of decay, which theſe columns exhibited, was but too obvious and affecting. "A few years," ſaid he, "and I ſhall become like the mortals on whoſe reliques I now gaze, and, like them too, I may be the ſubject of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation to a ſucceeding generation, which ſhall totter but a little while over the object they contemplate, ere they alſo ſink into the duſt."</p>
                     <p>Retiring from this ſcene, he walked through the cloiſters, till a door, which communicated with the lofty part of the building attracted his curioſity. He opened this and perceived, acroſs the foot of the ſtaircaſe, another door—but now, partly checked by fear, and partly by the recollection of the ſurpriſe his family might feel in his abſence, he returned with haſty ſtep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Some ſlight anſwer to Madame La Motte's inquiries, and a general direction to Peter to drive carefully on, and look for a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029379_0010_0FE089606FA07970"/>
road, was all that his anxiety would permit him to utter. The night ſhade fell thick round, which deepened by the gloom of the foreſt, ſoon rendered it dangerous to proceed. Peter ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but La Motte, perſiſting in his firſt determination, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to go on. Peter ventured to remonſtrate, Madame La Motte entreated, but La Motte reproved—commanded, and at length repented; for the hind wheel riſing upon the ſtump of in old tree, which the darkneſs had prevented Peter from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, the carriage was in an inſtant overturned.</p>
                     <p>The party, as may be ſuppoſed, were much terrified, but no one was materially hurt, and having diſengaged themſelves from their perilous ſituation, La Motte and Peter endeavoured to raiſe the carriage. The extent of this misfortune was now diſcovered, for they perceived that the wheel was broke. Their diſtreſs was reaſonably great, for not only was the coach diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled from proceeding, but it could not even afford a ſhelter from the cold dews of the night, it being impoſſible to preſerve it in an upright ſituation. After a few moment's ſilence, La Motte propoſed that they ſhould return to the ruins which they had juſt quitted, which lay at a very ſhort diſtance, and paſs the night in the moſt habitable part of them: that, when morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dawned, Peter ſhould take one of the coach horſes, and endeavour to find a road and a town, from whence aſſiſtance ſhould be procured for repairing the carriage. This propoſal was oppoſed by Madame La Motte, who ſhuddered at the idea of paſſing ſo many hours of darkneſs in a place ſo forlorn as the monaſtery. Terrors which ſhe neither endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, or combat, overcame her, and ſhe told La Motte ſhe had rather remain expoſed to the unwholeſome dews of night, than encounter the deſolation of the ruins. La Motte had at firſt felt an equal reluctance to return to this ſpot, but having ſubdued his own feelings, he reſolved not to yield to thoſe of his wife.</p>
                     <p>The horſes being now diſengaged from the carriage, the party moved towards the edifice. As they proceeded, Peter, who followed them, ſtruck a light, and they entered the ruins by the flame of ſticks, which he had collected. The partial gleams thrown acroſs the fabric ſeemed to make its deſolation more ſolemn, while the obſcurity of the greater part of the pile heightened its ſublimity, and led fancy on to ſcenes of horror. Adeline who had hitherto remained in ſilence, now uttered an exclamation of mingled admiration and fear. A kind of pleaſing dread thrilled her boſom, and filled all her
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029379_0010_0FE089606FA07970"/>
ſoul. Tears ſtarted into her eyes:—ſhe wiſhed, yet feared to go on;—ſhe hung upon the arm of La Motte, and looked at him with a ſort of heſitating interrogation.</p>
                     <p>He opened the door of the great hall, and they entered: its extent was loſt in gloom. "Let us ſtay here," ſaid Madame de la Motte, "I will go no farther." La Motte pointed to the broken roof, and was proceeding, when he was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an uncommon noiſe, which paſſed along the hall. They were all ſilent—it was the ſilence of terror. Madame La Motte ſpoke firſt. "Let us quit this ſpot," ſaid ſhe, "any evil is preferable to the feeling, which now oppreſſes me. Let us retire inſtantly." The ſtillneſs had for ſome time remained undiſturbed, and La Motte, aſhamed of the fear he had involuntarily betrayed, now thought it neceſſary to affect a boldneſs, which he did not feel. He, therefore, oppoſed ridicule to the terror of Madame, and inſiſted upon proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus compelled to acquieſce, ſhe traverſed the hall with trembling ſteps. They came to a narrow, paſſage, and Peter's ſticks being nearly exhauſted, they awaited here, while he went in ſearch of more.</p>
                     <p>The almoſt expiring light flaſhed faintly upon the walls of the paſſage, ſhewing the receſs more horrible. Acroſs the hall, the greater part of which was concealed in ſhadow, the feeble ray ſpread a tremulous gleam, exhibiting the chaſm in the roof, while many nameleſs objects were ſeen imperfectly through the duſk. Adeline with a ſmile, inquired of La Motte, if he believed in ſpirits. The queſtion was ill-timed, for the preſent ſcene impreſſed its terrors upon La Motte, and, in ſpite of endeavour, he felt a ſuperſtitious dread ſtealing upon him. He was now, perhaps, ſtanding over the aſhes of the dead. If ſpirits were ever permitted to reviſit the earth, this ſeemed the hour and the place moſt ſuitable for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. La Motte remaining ſilent, Adeline ſaid, "Were I inclined to ſuperſtion,"—She was interrupted by a return of the noiſe, which had been lately heard. It ſounded down the paſſage, at whoſe entrance they ſtood, and ſunk gradually away. Every heart palpitated, and they remained liſtening in ſilence. A new ſubject of apprehenſion ſeized La Motte:— the noiſe might proceed from banditti, and he heſitated whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would be ſafe to proceed. Peter now came with the light: Madame refuſed to enter the paſſage—La Motte was not much inclined to it; but Peter, in whom curioſity was more prevalent than fear readily offered his ſervices. La
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029379_0011_0FE08966305E2038"/>
Motte, after ſome heſitation, ſuffered him to go, while he awaited at the entrance the reſult of the inquiry. The extent of the paſſage ſoon concealed Peter from view, and the echoes of his footſteeps were loſt in a ſound, which ruſhed along the avenue, and became fainter and fainter, till it ſunk into ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. La Motte now called aloud to Peter, but no anſwer was returned; at length, they heard the ſound of a diſtant footſtep, and Peter ſoon after appeared, breathleſs, and pale with fear.</p>
                     <p>When he came within hearing of La Motte, he called out, "An pleaſe your honour, I've done for them, I believe, but I've had a hard bout. I thought I was fighting with the devil."—"What are you ſpeaking of?" ſaid La Motte.</p>
                     <p>"They were nothing but owls and rooks after all," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Peter; "but the light brought them all about my ears, and they made ſuch a confounded clapping with their wings, that I thought at firſt I had been beſet with a legion of devils. But I have drove them all out, maſter, and you have nothing to fear now."</p>
                     <p>The latter part of the ſentence, intimating a ſuſpicion of his courage, La Motte could have diſpenſed with, and, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve in ſome degree his reputation, he made a point of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding through the paſſage. They now moved on with alacrity, for as Peter ſaid, they had "nothing to fear."</p>
                     <p>The paſſage led into a large area, on one ſide of which, over a range of cloiſters, appeared the weſt tower, and a lofty part of the edifice; the other ſide was open to the woods. La Motte led the way to a door of the tower, which he now perceived was the ſame he had formerly entered; but he found ſome difficulty in advancing, for the area was overgrown with brambles and nettles, and the light, which Peter carried, afforded only an uncertain gleam. When he uncloſed the door, the diſmal aſpect of the place revived the apprehenſions of Madame La Motte, and extorted from Adeline an inquiry whither they were going. Peter held up the light to ſhew the narrow ſtaircaſe that wound round the tower; but La Motte obſerving the ſecond door, drew back the ruſty bol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> and entered a ſpacious apartment, which, from its ſtile and condition, was evidently of a much later date than the other part of the ſtructure: though deſolate and forlorn, it was very little impaired by time; the walls were damp, but not decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the glaſs was yet firm in the windows.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:029379_0011_0FE08966305E2038"/>They paſſed on to a ſuit of apartments reſembling the firſt they had ſeen, and expreſſed their ſurpriſe at the incongruous appearance of this part of the edifice with the mouldering walls they had left behind. Theſe apartments conducted them to a winding paſſage, that received light and air through nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cavities placed high in the wall and was at length cloſed by a door barred with iron, which being with ſome difficulty opened, they entered a vaulted room. La Motte ſurveyed it with a ſcrutinizing eye, and endeavoured to conjecture for what purpoſe it had been guarded by a door of ſuch ſtrength; but he ſaw ilttle within to aſſiſt his curioſity. The room ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have been built in modern times upon a Gothic plan. Adeline approached a large window that formed a kind of receſs raiſed by one ſtep over the level of the floor; ſhe obſerved to La Motte that the whole floor was inlaid with Moſaic work; which drew from him a remark, that the ſtyle of this apartment was not ſtrictly Gothic. He paſſed on to a door, which appeared on the oppoſite ſide of the apartment, and unlocking it, found himſelf in the great hall, by which he had entered the fabric.</p>
                     <p>He now perceived, what the gloom had before concealed, a ſpiral ſtaircaſe, which led to a gallery above; and which, from its preſent condition, ſeemed to have been built with the more modern part of the fabric, though this alſo affected the Gothic mode of architecture: La Motte had little doubt that theſe ſtairs led to apartments, correſponding with thoſe he had paſſed below, and heſitated whether to explore them: but the entreaties of Madame, who was much fatigued, prevailed with him to defer all further examination. After ſome delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, in which of the rooms they ſhould paſs the night, they determined to return to that which opened from the tower.</p>
                     <p>A fire was kindled on a hearth, which it is probable had not for many years before afforded the warmth of hoſpitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and Peter having ſpread the proviſion he had brought from the coach, La Motte and his family, encircled round the fire, partook of a repaſt, which hunger and fatigue made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious. Apprehenſion gradually gave way to confidence, for they now found themſelves in ſomething like a human habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and they had leiſure to laugh at their late terrors; but, as the blaſt ſhook the doors, Adeline often ſtarted, and threw a fearful glance around. They continued to laugh and talk cheerfully for a time; yet their merriment was tranſient, if not affected; for a ſenſe of their peculiar and diſtreſſed cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029379_0012_0FE0897777EF03F8"/>
preſſed upon their recollection, and ſunk each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual into langour and penſive ſilence. Adeline felt the forlornneſs of her condition with energy; ſhe reflected upon the paſt with aſtoniſhment, and anticipated the future with fear. She found herſelf wholly dependent upon ſtrangers, with no other claim than what diſtreſs demands from the common ſympathy of kindred beings; ſighs ſwelled her heart, and the frequent tear ſtarted to her eye; but ſhe checked it, ere it betrayed on her cheek the ſorrow, which ſhe thought it would be ungrateful to reveal.</p>
                     <p>La Motte, at length, broke this meditative ſilence, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the fire to be renewed for the night, and the door to be ſecured: this ſeemed a neceſſary precaution, even in this ſolitude, and was effected by means of large ſtones piled againſt it, for other faſtening there was none. It had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occurred to La Motte, that this apparently forſaken edifice might be a place of refuge to banditti. Here was ſolitude to conceal them; and a wild and extenſive foreſt to aſſiſt their ſchemes of rapine, and to perplex, with its labyrinths, thoſe who might be bold enough to attempt purſuit. Theſe apprehenſions, however, he hid within his own boſom, ſaving his companions from a ſhare of the uneaſineſs they occaſioned. Peter was ordered to watch at the door, and having gives the fire a rouſing ſtir, our deſolate party drew round it, and ſought in ſleep a ſhort oblivion of care.</p>
                     <p>The night paſſed on without diſturbance. Adeline ſlept, but uneaſy dreams fleeted before her fancy, and ſhe awoke at an early hour: the recollection of her ſorrows aroſe upon her mind, and yielded to their preſſure, her tears flowed ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and faſt. That ſhe might indulge them without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, ſhe went to a window that looked upon an open part of the foreſt; all was gloom and ſilence; ſhe ſtood for ſome time viewing the ſhadowy ſcene.</p>
                     <p>The firſt tender tints of morning now appeared on the verge of the horizon, ſtealing upon the darkneſs;—ſo pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029379_0012_0FE0897777EF03F8"/>
emerged on the horizon, which quickly expanding, the ſun appeared in all his glory, unveiling the whole face of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, vivifying every colour of the landſcape, and ſprinkling the dewy earth with glittering light. The low and gentle reſponſes of birds, awakened by the morning ray, now broke the ſilence of the hour; their ſoft warbling riſing by degrees till they ſwelled the chorus of univerſal gladneſs. Adeline's heart ſwelled too with gratitude and adoration.</p>
                     <p>The ſcene before her ſoothed her mind, and exalted her thoughts to the great Author of Nature; ſhe uttered an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary prayer: "Father of good, who made this glorious ſcene! I reſign myſelf to thy hands: thou wilt ſupport me under my preſent ſorrows, and protect me from future evil."</p>
                     <p>Thus confiding in the benevolence of God, ſhe wiped the tears from her eyes, while the ſweet union of conſcience and reflection rewarded her truſt; and her mind, loſing the feelings which had lately oppreſſed it, became tranquil and compoſed.</p>
                     <p>La Motte awoke ſoon after, and Peter prepared to ſet out on his expedition. As he mounted his horſe "An' pleaſe you, Maſter." ſaid he, "I think we had as good look no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for an habitation till better times turn up; for nobody will think of looking for us here; and when one ſees the place by day light, its none ſo bad, but what a little patching up would make it comfortable enough." La Motte made no reply, but he thought of Peter's words. During the intervals of the night, when anxiety had kept him waking, the ſame idea had occurred to him; concealment was his only ſecurity, and this place afforded it. The deſolation of the ſpot was repulſive to his wiſhes; but he had only a choice of evil; a foreſt with liberty was not a bad home for one, who had too much reaſon to expect a priſon. As he walked through the apartments, and examined their condition more attentively, he perceived they might eaſily be made habitable; and now ſurveying them under the cheerfulneſs of morning, his deſign ſtrengthened; and he muſed upon the means of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, which nothing ſeemed ſo much to obſtruct as the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent difficulty of procuring food.</p>
                     <p>He communicated his thoughts to Madame La Motte, who felt repugnance to the ſcheme. La Motte, however ſeldom conſulted his wife till he had determined how to act; and he had already reſolved to be guided in this affair by the report of Peter. If he could diſcover a town in the neighbourhood of the foreſt, where proviſion and other neceſſaries could be procured, he would ſeek no farther for a place of reſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="24" facs="unknown:029379_0013_0FE0897C0C0408D8"/>In the mean time, he ſpent the anxious interval of Peter's abſence in examining the ruin, and walking over the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons; they were ſweetly romantic, and the luxuriant woods, with which they abounded, ſeemed to ſequeſter this ſpot from the reſt of the world. Frequently a natural viſta would yield a view of the country, terminated by hills, which retiring in diſtance, faded into the blue horizon. A ſtream, various and muſical in its courſe, wound at the foot of the lawn, on which ſtood the abbey; here it ſilently glided beneath the ſhades, feeding the flowers that bloomed on its banks, and diffuſing dewy freſhneſs around; there it ſpread in broad expanſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, reflecting the ſylvan ſcene, and the wild deer that taſted its waves. La Motte obſerved every where a profuſion of game; the pheaſants ſcarcely flew from his approach, and the deer gazed mildly at him as he paſſed. They were ſtrangers to man!</p>
                     <p>On his return to the abbey, La Motte aſcended the ſtairs that led to the tower. About half way up, a door appeared in the wall; it yielded, without reſiſtance, to his hand; but, a ſudden noiſe within, accompanied by a cloud of duſt, made him ſtep back and cloſe the door. After waiting a few min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes, he again opened it, and perceived a large room of the more modern building. The remains of tapeſtry hung in tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the walls, which were become the reſidence of birds of prey, whoſe ſudden flight on the opening of the door had brought down a quantity of duſt, and occaſioned the noiſe. The windows were ſhattered, and almoſt without glaſs: but he was ſurpriſed to obſerve ſome remains of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>On the oppoſite ſide of the room was a door, which led to another apartment, proportioned like the firſt, but hung with arras ſomewhat leſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tered chairs were placed round the walls. La Motte gazed with a mixture of wonder and curioſity. "'Tis ſtrange," ſaid he, "that theſe rooms and theſe alone, ſhould bear the marks of inhabitation; perhaps, ſome wretched wanderer, like myſelf, may have here ſought refuge from a perſecuting world; and here, perhaps, laid down the load of exiſtence: perhaps, too, I have followed his footſteps, but to mingle my duſt with his!" He turned ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and was about to quit the room, when he perceived a ſmall door <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r the bed; it opened into a cloſet, which was
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:029379_0013_0FE0897C0C0408D8"/>
lighted by one ſmall window, and was in the ſame condition as the apartments he had paſſed, except that it was deſtitute even of the remains of furniture. As he walked over the floor, he thought he felt one part of it ſhake beneath his ſteps, and, examining, found a trap door. Curioſity prompted him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore farther, and with ſome difficulty he opened it. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed a ſtaircaſe which terminated in darkneſs. La Motte deſcended a few ſteps, but was unwilling to truſt the abyſs; and, after wondering for what purpoſe it was ſo ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, he cloſed the trap, and quitted this ſuit of apartments.</p>
                     <p>The ſtairs in the tower above were ſo much decayed, that he did not attempt to aſcend them: he returned to the hall, and by the ſpiral ſtaircaſe, which he had obſerved the evening before, reached the gallery, and found another ſuit of apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments entirely unfurniſhed, very much like thoſe below.</p>
                     <p>He renewed with Madame La Motte his former converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting the abbey, and ſhe exerted all her endeavours to diſſuade him from his purpoſe, acknowledging the ſolitary ſecurity of the ſpot, but pleading that other places might be found equally well adapted for concealment and more for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. This La Motte doubted: beſides, the foreſt abounded with game, which would at once, afford him amuſement and food, a circumſtance, conſidering his ſmall ſtock of money, by no means to be overlooked: and he had ſuffered his mind to dwell ſo much upon the ſcheme, that it was become a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite one. Adeline liſtened in ſilent anxiety to the diſcourſe, and waited the iſſue of Peter's report.</p>
                     <p>The morning paſſed, but Peter did not return. Our ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary party took their dinner of the proviſion they had fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately brought with them, and afterwards walked forth into the woods. Adeline, who never ſuffered any good to paſs unnoticed, becauſe it came attended with evil, forgot for a while the deſolation of the abbey in the beauty of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſcenery. The pleaſantneſs of the ſhades ſoothed her heart, and the varied features of the landſcape amuſed her fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; ſhe almoſt thought ſhe could be contented to live here. Already ſhe began to feel an intereſt in the concerns of her companions, and for Madame La Motte ſhe felt more; it was the warm emotion of gratitude and affection.</p>
                     <p>The afternoon wore away, and they returned to the abbey. Peter was ſtill abſent, and his abſence now began to excite ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and apprehenſion. The approach of darkneſs alſo threw a gloom upon the hopes of the wanderers: another night muſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029379_0014_0FE0898A15BDB450"/>
be paſſed under the ſame forlorn circumſtances as the preceding one; and, what was ſtill worſe, with a very ſcanty ſtock of proviſions. The fortitude of Madame La Motte now entirely forſook her, and ſhe wept bitterly. Adeline's heart was as mournful as Madame's, but ſhe rallied her drooping ſpirits, and gave the firſt inſtance of her kindneſs by endeavouring to revive thoſe of her friend.</p>
                     <p>La Motte was reſtleſs and uneaſy, and, leaving the abbey, he walked alone the way which Peter had taken. He had not gone far, when he perceived him between the trees, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his horſe. "What news, Petter?" hallooed La Motte. Peter came on, panting for breath, and ſaid not a word, till La Motte repeated the queſtion in a tone of ſomewhat more authority. "Ah, bleſs you Maſter!" ſaid he, when he had taken breath to anſwer, "I am glad to ſee you; I thought I ſhould never have got back again: I've met with a world of misfortunes."</p>
                     <p>"Well, you may relate them hereafter; let me hear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have diſcovered—"</p>
                     <p>"Diſcovered!" interrupted Peter, Yes, I am diſcovered with a vengeance! If your Honour will look at my arms, you'll ſee how I am diſcovered."</p>
                     <p>"Diſcoloured! I ſuppoſe you mean," ſaid La Motte. "But how came you in this condition?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, I'll tell you how it was, Sir; your Honour knows I learned a ſmack of boxing of that Engliſhman that uſed to come with his maſter to our houſe."</p>
                     <p>"Well, well—tell me where you have been."</p>
                     <p>"I ſcarcely know myſelf, Maſter; I've been where I got a ſound drubbing, but then it was in your buſineſs, and ſo I don't mind. But if ever I meet with that raſcal again!"—</p>
                     <p>"You ſeem to like your firſt drubbing ſo well, that you want another, and unleſs you ſpeak more to the purpoſe, you ſhall ſoon have one."</p>
                     <p>Peter was now frightened into method, and endeavoured to proceed: "When I left the old abbey," ſaid he, "I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way you directed, and, turning to the right of that grove of trees yonder, I looked this way and that, to ſee if I could ſee a houſe, or a cottage, or even a man, but not a <hi>ſoul</hi> of them was to be ſeen, and ſo I jogged on, near the value of a league, I warrant, and then I came to a track; oh! oh ſays I, we have you now; this will do—paths can't be made without feet. However, I was out in my reckoning, for the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:029379_0014_0FE0898A15BDB450"/>
devil a bit of a <hi>ſoul</hi> could I ſee, and after following the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rack this way and that way, for the third of a league, I loſt it, and had to find out another."</p>
                     <p>"Is it impoſſible for you to ſpeak to the point?" ſaid La Motte: "omit theſe fooliſh particulars, and tell whether you have ſucceeded."</p>
                     <p>"Well, then, Maſter, to be ſhort for that's the neareſt way after all, I wandered a long while at random, I did not know where, all through a foreſt like this, and I took ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care to note how the trees ſtood, that I might find my way back. At laſt I came to another path, and was ſure I ſhould find ſomething now, though I had found nothing before, for I could not be miſtaken twice; ſo, peeping between the trees, I ſpied a cottage, and I gave my horſe a laſh, that ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded through the foreſt, and I was at the door in a minute. They told me there was a town about half a league off, and bade me follow the track and it would bring me there, ſo it did; and my horſe I believe ſmelt the coin in the manger by the rate he went at. I inquired for a wheel-wright, and was told there was but one in the place, and he could not be found. I waited and waited, for I knew it was in vain to think of returning without doing my buſineſs. The man at laſt came home from the country, and I told him how long I had wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for, ſays I, I knew it was in vain to return without my buſineſs."</p>
                     <p>"Do be leſs tedious," ſaid La Motte, if it is in thy nature."</p>
                     <p>"It is in my nature," anſwered Peter, "and if it was more in my nature, your Honour ſhould have it all. Would you think it, Sir, the fellow had the impudence to aſk a louis-d'or for mending the coach wheel! I believe in my conſcience he ſaw I was in a hurry and could not do without him. A louis-d'or! ſays I, my Maſter ſhall give no ſuch price, he ſha'n't be impoſed upon by no ſuch raſcal as you. Whereupon, the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low looked glum, and gave me a douſe o'the chops: with this, I up with my fiſt and gave him another, and ſhould have beat him preſently, if another man had not come in, and then I was obliged to give up."</p>
                     <p>"And ſo you are returned as wiſe as you went?"</p>
                     <p>"Why Maſter, I hope I have too much ſpirit to ſubmit to a raſcal, or let you ſubmit to one either; beſides, I have bought ſome nails to try if I can't mend the wheel myſelf — I had always a hand at carpentry."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="28" facs="unknown:029379_0015_0FE0899014681348"/>"Well, I commend your zeal in my cauſe, but on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion it was rather ill-timed. And what have you got in that baſket?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, Maſter, I bethought me that we could not get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from this place till the carriage was ready to draw us, and in the mean time, ſays I, no body can live without vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, ſo I'll e'en lay out the little money I have and take a baſket with me."</p>
                     <p>"That's the only wiſe thing you have done yet, and, this indeed, redeems your blunders."</p>
                     <p>"Why, now, Maſter it does my heart good to hear you ſpeak; I knew I was doing for the beſt all the while: but I've had a hard job to find my way back; and here's another piece of ill luck, for the horſe has got a thorn in his foot."</p>
                     <p>La Motte made inquiries concerning the town, and found it was capable of ſupplying him with proviſion, and what little furniture was neceſſary to render the abbey habitable. This intelligence almoſt ſettled his plans, and he ordered Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to return on the following morning and make inquiries concerning the abbey. If the anſwers were favourable to his wiſhes, he commiſſioned him to buy a cart, and load it with ſome furniture, and ſome materials neceſſary for repairing the modern apartments. Peter ſtared: "What, does your Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our mean to live here?"</p>
                     <p>"Why, ſuppoſe I do?"</p>
                     <p>"Why then your Honour has made a wiſe determination, according to my hint; for your Honour knows I ſaid"—</p>
                     <p>"Well, Peter, it is not neceſſary to repeat what you ſaid; perhaps I had determined on the ſubject before."</p>
                     <p>"Egad, Maſter, you're in the right, and I'm glad of it, for, I believe, we ſhall not quickly be diſturbed here, except by the rooks and owls. Yes, yes—I warrant I'll make it a place fit for a king; and as for the town, one may get any thing, I'm ſure of that; though they think no more about this place than they do about India or England, or any of thoſe places."</p>
                     <p>They now reached the abbey, where Peter was received with great joy; but the hopes of his miſtreſs and Adeline were repreſſed, when they learned that he returned, without having executed his commiſſion, and heard his account of the town. La Motte's orders to Peter were heard with almoſt equal concern by Madame and Adeline; but the latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed her uneaſineſs, and uſed all her efforts to overcome that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029379_0015_0FE0899014681348"/>
of her friend. The ſweetneſs of her behaviour, and the air of ſatisfaction ſhe aſſumed, ſenſibly affected Madame, and diſcovered to her a ſource of comfort, which ſhe had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to overlooked. The affectionate attentions of her young friend promiſed to conſole her for the want of other ſociety, and her converſation to enliven the hours which might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be paſſed in painful regret.</p>
                     <p>The obſervations and general behaviour of Adeline already beſpoke a good underſtanding, and an amiable heart, but ſhe had yet more—ſhe had genious. She was now in her nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year; her figure of the middling ſize, and turned to the moſt exquiſite proportion; her hair was dark auburn, her eyes blue, and whether they ſparkled with intelligence, or melted with tenderneſs, they were equally attractive: her form had the airy lightneſs of a nymph, and, when ſhe ſmiled, her countenance might have been drawn for the younger ſiſter of Hebe: the captivations of her beauty were heightened by the grace and ſimplicity of her manners, and confirmed by the intrinſic value of a heart

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Annette now kindled the fire for the night: Peter's baſket was opened, and ſupper prepared. Madame La Motte was ſtill penſive and ſilent. "There is ſcarcely any condition ſo bad," ſaid Adeline, "but we may one time or other wiſh we had not qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Honeſt Peter, when he was bewilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the foreſt, or had two enemies to encounter inſtead of one, confeſſes he wiſhed himſelf at the abbey. And I am certain, there is no ſituation ſo deſtitute, but comfort may be extracted from it. The blaze of this fire ſhines yet more cheerfully from the contraſted drearineſs of the place; and this plentiful repaſt is made yet more delicious, from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary want we have ſuffered. Let us enjoy the good and forget the evil."</p>
                     <p>"You ſpeak, my dear," replied Madame La Motte, "like one, whoſe ſpirits have not been often depreſſed by misfortune, (Adeline ſig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"The illuſion is gone—I can no longer deceive myſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, Sir, if I ſay, it is now only you deceive yourſelf, by ſuffering the cloud of ſorrow to tinge every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject you look upon."</p>
                     <p>"It may be ſo," ſaid La Motte, "but let us leave the ſubject."</p>
                     <p>After ſupper, the doors were ſecured, as before, for the night, and the wanderers reſigned themſelves to repoſe.</p>

                     <p>Of the abbey he gave an account, of which the following is the ſubſtance:—It belonged, together with a large part of the adjacent foreſt, to a nobleman, who now reſided with his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He inherited it, in right of his wife from his father-in-law, who had cauſed the more mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern apartments to be erected, and had reſided in them ſome part of every year, for the purpoſe of ſhooting and hunting. It was reported, that ſome perſon was ſoon after it came to the preſent poſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At firſt, it called up unpleaſant ideas, but they were ſoon diſmiſſed, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations more intereſting to his welfare took place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated himſelf that he had now found a ſpot, where he was not likely to be either diſcovered or diſturbed; yet it could not eſcape him that there was a ſtrange coincidence between one part of Peter's narrative, and the condition of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that opened from the tower above ſtairs. The remains of furniture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which the other apartments were void—the ſolitary bed—the number and connection of the rooms, were circumſtances that united to confirm his opinion. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he concealed in his own breaſt, for he already perceived that Peter's account had not aſſiſted in reconciling his family to the neceſſity of dwelling at the abbey.</p>
                     <p>But they had only to ſubmit in ſilence, and whatever diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable apprehenſion might intrude upon them, they now appeared willing to ſuppreſs the expreſſion of it. Peter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, was exempt from any evil of this kind; he knew no fear, and his mind was now wholly occupied with his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching buſineſs. Madame La Motte, with a placed kind of deſpair, endeavoured to reconcile herſelf to that, which no effort of underſtanding could teach her to avoid, and which, an indulgence in lamentation, could only make more intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Indeed, though a ſenſe of the immediate inconveniences to be endured at the abbey, had made her oppoſe the ſcheme of living there, ſhe did not really know how their ſituation, could be improved by removal: yet her thoughts often wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered towards Paris, and reflected the retroſpect of paſt times, with the images of weeping friends left, perhaps, for ever. The affectionate endearments of her only ſon, whom, from the danger of his ſituation, and the obſcurity of hers, ſhe might reaſonably fear never to ſee again, aroſe upon her memory and overcame her fortitude. "Why, why was I reſerved for this hour?" would ſhe ſay, "and what will be my years to come?"</p>
                     <p>Adeline had no retroſpect of paſt delight to give emphaſis to preſent calamity—no weeping friends—no dear regretted objects to point the edge of ſorrow, and throw a ſickly hue upon her future proſpects: ſhe knew not yet the pangs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed hope, or the acuter ſting of ſelf accuſation; ſhe had no miſery, but what patience could aſſuage, or fortitude overcome.</p>
                     <p>At the dawn of the following day Peter aroſe to his labour: he proceeded with alacrity, and, in a few days, two of the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:029379_0017_0FE089A2AA9A1CD8"/>
lower apartments were ſo much altered for the better, that La Motte began to exult, and his family to perceive that their ſituation would not be ſo miſerable as they had imagined. The furniture Peter had already brought was diſpoſed in theſe rooms, one of which was the vaulted apartment. Madame La Motte furniſhed this as a fitting room, preferring it for its large Gothic Window, that deſcended almoſt to the floor, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a proſpect of the lawn, and the pictureſque ſcenery of the ſurrounding woods.</p>
                     <p>Peter having returned to Auboine for a farther ſupply, all the lower apartments were in a few weeks not only habitable, but comfortable. Theſe, however, being inſufficient for the accommodation of the family, a room above ſtairs was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Adeline; it was the chamber that opened immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the tower, and ſhe preferred it to thoſe beyond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was leſs diſtant from the family, and the windows fronting an avenue of the foreſt, afforded a more extenſive proſpect. The tapeſtry, that was decayed, and hung looſely from the walls, was now nailed up, and made to look leſs deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate; and, though the room had ſtill a ſolemn aſpect, from its ſpaciouſneſs and the narrowneſs of the windows, it was not uncomfortable.</p>
                     <p>The firſt night that Adeline retired hither, ſhe ſlept little: the ſolitary air of the place affected her ſpirits; the more ſo, perhaps, becauſe ſhe had, with friendly conſideration, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſupport them in the preſence of Madame La Motte. She remembered the narrative of Peter, ſeveral circumſtances of which had impreſſed her imagination in ſpite of her reaſon, and ſhe found it difficult wholly to ſubdue apprehenſion. At one time, terror ſo ſtrongly ſeized her mind, that ſhe had even opened the door with an intention of calling Madame La Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te; but, liſtening for a moment on the ſtairs of the tower every thing ſeemed ſtill; at length ſhe heard the voice of La Motte ſpeaking cheerfully, and the abſurdity of her fears ſtruck her forcibly; ſhe bluſhed that ſhe had for a moment ſubmitted to them, and returned to her chamber wondering at herſelf.</p>

                     <p>LA Motte arrainged his little plan of living. His morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were uſually ſpent in ſhooting, or fiſhing, and the dinner thus provided by his induſtry, he reliſhed with a keener appetite than had ever attended him at the luxurious tables of Paris. The afternoons he paſſed with his family: ſometimes he would ſelect a book from the few he had brought with him, and endea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oured to fix his attention to the words his lips re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated:—but his mind ſuffered little abſtraction from its own cares, and the ſentiment he pronounced left no trace behind it. Sometimes he converſed, but oftener ſat in gloomy ſilence, muſing upon the paſt, or anticipating the future.</p>
                     <p>At theſe moments, Adeline, with a ſweetneſs almoſt irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, endeavoured to enliven his ſpirits, and to withdraw him from himſelf. Seldom ſhe ſucceeded, but when ſhe did, the grateful looks of Madame La Motte, and the benevolent feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her own boſom, realized the cheerfulneſs ſhe had at firſt only aſſumed. Adeline's mind had the happy art, or, perhaps, it were more juſt to ſay the happy nature, of accommodating itſelf to her ſituation. Her preſent condition, though forlorn, was not devoid of comfort, and this comfort was confirmed by her virtue. So much ſhe won upon the affections of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, that Madame La Motte loved her as her child, and La Motte himſelf, though a man little ſuſceptible of tenderneſs, could not be inſenſible to her ſolicitudes. Whenever he relaxed from the ſullenneſs of miſery, it was at the influence of Adeline.</p>
                     <p>Peter regularly brought a weekly ſupply of proviſions from Auboine, and, on thoſe occaſions, always quitted the town by a route contrary to that leading to the abbey. Several weeks having paſſed without moleſtation, La Motte diſmiſſed all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of purſuit, and at length became tolerably recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the complection of his circumſtances. As habit and effort ſtrengthened the fortitude of Madame La Motte, the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:029379_0018_0FE089B0F9422C30"/>
features of misfortune appeared to ſoften. The foreſt, which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She was a ſenſible and highly accompliſhed woman, and it became her chief delight to form the riſing graces of Adeline, who had as has been already ſhown, a ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, which made her quick to repay inſtruction with improvement, and indulgence with love. Never was Adeline ſo pleaſed as when ſhe anticipated her wiſhes, and never ſo diligent as when ſhe was employed in her buſineſs. The lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle affairs of the houſhold ſhe overlooked and managed with ſuch admirable exactneſs, that Madame La Motte had neither anxiety, nor care, concerning them. And Adeline formed for herſelf in this barren ſituation, many amuſements, that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally baniſhed the remembrance of her misfortunes. La Motte's books were her chief conſolation. With one of theſe ſhe would frequently ramble into the foreſt, where the river winding through a glade, diffuſed coolneſs, and with its mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring accents, invited repoſe: there ſhe would ſeat herſelf, and reſigned to the illuſions of the page, paſs many hours in oblivion of ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Here too when her mind was tranquilized by the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcenery, ſhe wooed the gentle muſe, and indulged in ideal hippineſs. The delight of theſe moments ſhe commem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orated in the following addreſs

Adeline had given a brief account of the manner in which ſhe had been brought thither, but had always with tears intreated to be ſpared for that time from a particular relation of her hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>Her ſpirits were not then equal to retroſpection, but now that they were ſoothed by quiet, and ſtrengthened by confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhe one day gave Madame La Motte the following narration.</p>
                     <p>I am the only child, ſaid Adeline, of Louis de St. Pierre, a chevalier of reputable family, but of ſmall fortune, who for many years reſided at Paris. Of my mother I have a faint remembrance; I loſt her when I was only ſeven years old, and this was my firſt misfortune. At her death, my father gave up houſe keeping, boarded me in a convent and quitted Paris. Thus was I, at this early period of my life, abandoned to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. My father came ſometimes to Paris; he then viſited me and I well remember the grief I uſed to feel when he bade me farewell. On theſe occaſions, which rung my heart with grief, he appeared unmoved; ſo that I often thought he had little tenderneſs for me. But he was my father; and the only perſon to whom I could look up for protection, and love.</p>
                     <p>In this convent I continued till I was twelve years old. A thouſand times I had entreated my father to take me home, but at firſt motives of prudence and afterwards of avarice prevented him. I was now removed from this conven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and placed in another, where I learned my father intended I ſhould take the veil. I will not attempt to expreſs my ſurpriſe and grief on this occaſion. Too long I had been imm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ed in the walls of a cloiſter, and too much had I ſeen of the ſullen miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of its votaries, not to feel horror and diſguſt at the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of being added to their number.</p>
                     <p>The Lady Abbeſs was a woman of rigid decorum and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere devotion; exact in the obſervance of every detail of form, and never forgave an offence againſt ceremony. It was her method when ſhe wanted to make converts to her order, to denounce and terrify rather than to perſuade and allure. Her's were the arts of cunning practiſed upon fear, not thoſe of ſophiſtication upon reaſon. She employed numberleſs ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029379_0019_0FE089B5B25DB510"/>
to gain me to her purpoſe, and they all wore the complection of her character. But in the life to which ſhe would have devoted me, I ſaw too many forms of real ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to be overcome by the influenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of her ideal hoſt, and was reſolute in rejecting the veil. Here I paſſed ſeveral years of miſerable reſiſtance againſt cruelty and ſuperſtition. My father I ſeldom ſaw; when I did, I entreated him to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my deſtination, but he objected that his fortune was inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupport me in the world, and at length denounced vengeance on my head if I perſiſted in diſobedience.</p>
                     <p>You, my dear Madam, can form little idea of the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of my ſituation, condemned to perpetual impriſonment, and impriſonment of the moſt dreadful kind, or to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of a father, from whom I had no appeal. My reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion relaxed—for ſome time I pauſed upon the choice of evils—but at length the horrors of the monaſtic life <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oſe ſo fully to my view, that fortitude gave way before them. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the cheerful intercourſe of ſociety—from the pleaſant view of nature—almoſt from the light of day—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to ſilence—rigid formality—abſtinence and penance— condemned to forego the delights of a world, which imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation painted in the gayeſt and moſt alluring colours, and whoſe hues were, perhaps, not the leſs captivating becauſe they were only ideal—ſuch was the ſtate, to which I was deſtined. Again my reſolution was invigorated: my father's cruelty ſubdued tenderneſs, and rouſed indignation. "Since he can forget, ſaid I, the affection of a parent, and condemn his child without remorſe to wretchedneſs and deſpair—the bond of filial and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Finding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e unmoved by menace, the Lady Abbeſs had now recourſe to more ſubtle meaſures: ſhe condeſcended to ſmile, and even to flatter; but her's was the diſtorted ſmile, of cunning, not the gracious emblem of kindneſs; it provoked diſguſt, inſtead of inſpiring affection. She painted the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of a veſtal in the moſt beautiful tints of art—its holy innocence—its mild dignity; its ſublime devotion. I ſighed as ſhe ſpoke. This ſhe regarded as a favourable ſymptom, and proceeded on her picture with more animation. She deſcribed the ſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nity of a monaſtic life—its ſecurity from the ſeductive charms, reſtleſs paſſion, and ſorrowful viciſſitudes of the world—the rapturous delights of religion, and the ſweet reciprocal affection of the ſiſterhood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="37" facs="unknown:029379_0019_0FE089B5B25DB510"/>So highly ſhe finiſhed the piece, that the lurking lines of cunning would, to an inexperienced eye, have eſcaped detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Mine was too ſorrowfully informed. Too often had I witneſſed the ſecret tear and burſting ſigh of vain regret, the ſullen pinings of diſcontent, and the mute anguiſh of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. My ſilence and my manner aſſured her of my incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and it was with difficulty that ſhe preſerved a decent compoſure.</p>
                     <p>My father, as may be imagined, was highly incenſed at my perſeverance, which he called obſtinacy, but, what will not be ſo eaſily believed, he ſoon after relented, and appointed a day to take me from the convent. O! judge of my feelings when I received this intelligence. The joy it occaſioned awakened all my gratitude; I forgot the former cruelty of my father, and that the preſent indulgence was leſs the effect of his kindneſs than of my reſolution. I wept that I could not indulge his every wiſh.</p>
                     <p>What days of bliſsful expectation were thoſe that preceded my departure! The world, from which I had been hitherto ſecluded—The world, in which my fancy had been ſo often delighted to roam—whoſe paths were ſtrewn with fadeleſs roſes—whoſe every ſcene ſmiled in beauty and invited to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light—where all the people were good, and all the good happy—Ah! <hi>then</hi> that world was burſting upon my view. Let me catch the rapturous remembrance before it vaniſh! It is like the paſſing lights of autumn, that gleam for a moment on a hill, and then leave it to darkneſs. I counted the days and hours that withheld me from this fairy land. It was in the convent only that people were deceitful and cruel: it was there only that miſery dwelt. I was quitting it all! How I pitied the poor nuns that were to be left behind. I would have given half that world I prized ſo much, had it been mine, to have taken them out with me.</p>
                     <p>The long wiſhed for day at laſt arrived. My father came, and for a moment my joy was loſt in the ſorrow of bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding farewell to my poor companions, for whom I had never felt ſuch warmth of kindneſs as at this inſtant. I was ſoon beyond the gates of the convent. I looked around me, and viewed the vaſt vault of heaven no longer bounded by mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtic walls, and the green earth extended in hill and da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

to ſpeak. My thoughts roſe to Heaven in ſentiments of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to the Giver of all good!</p>
                     <p>At lengeh, I returned to my father; dear Sir, ſaid I, how I thank you for my deliverance, and how I wiſh I could do ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing to oblige you.</p>

I ſhuddered; his look and manner jarred the tone of my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; they ſtruck diſcord upon my heart, which had before reſponded only to harmony. The ardour of joy was in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment repreſſed, and every object around me was ſaddened with the gloom of diſappointment. It was not that I ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my father would take me back to the convent; but that his feelings ſeemed ſo very diſſonant of the joy and gratitude which I had but a moment before felt and expreſſed to him.— Pardon, Madame a relation of theſe trivial circumſtances; the ſtrong viciſſitudes of feeling which they impreſſed upon my heart, make me think them important, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"No, my dear," ſaid Madame La Motte, they are intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, they illuſtrate little traits of character, which I love to obſerve. You are worthy of all my regards, and from this moment I give my tendereſt pity to your misfortunes, and my affection to your goodneſs."</p>
                     <p>Theſe words melted the heart of Adeline; ſhe kiſſed the hand which Madame held out, and remained a few minutes ſilent. At length ſhe ſaid, "May I deſerve this goodneſs and may I ever be thankful to God, who, in giving me ſuch a friend, has raiſed me to comfort and hope!</p>
                     <p>"My father's houſe was ſituated a few leagues on the other ſide of Paris, and in our way to it, we paſſed through that city. What a novel ſcene! Where were now the ſolemn faces, the demure manners I had been accuſtomed to ſee in the convent? Every countenance was here animated either by buſineſs or pleaſure; every ſtep was airy, and every ſmile was gay. All the people appeared like friends; they looked and ſmiled at me; I ſmiled again, and wiſhed to have told them how pleaſed I was. How delightful, ſaid I, to live ſurrounded by friends!</p>
                     <p>"What crowded ſtreets! What magnificent hotels! What ſplendid equipages! I ſcarcely obſerved that the ſtreets were narrow, or the way dangerous. What buſtle, what tumult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029379_0020_0FE089C77988D220"/>
my gratitude to my father, but his looks forbade me, and I was ſilent. I am too diffuſe; even the faint forms which memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reflects of paſſed delight are grateful to the heart. The ſhadow of pleaſure is ſtill gazed upon with a melancholy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, though the ſubſtance is fled beyond our reach."</p>
                     <p>"Having quitted Paris, which I left with many ſighs, and gazed upon till the towers of every church diſſolved in diſtance from my view; we entered upon a gloomy and unfrequented road. It was evening when we reached a wild heath; I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round in ſearch of a human dwelling, but could find none; and not a human being was to be ſeen. I experienced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what I uſed to feel in the convent; my heart had not been ſo ſad ſince I left it. Of my father, who ſtill ſat in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, I inquired if we were near home; he anſwered in the affirmative. Night came on, however, before we reached the place of our deſtination; it was a lone houſe on the waſte; but I need not deſcribe it to you, Madame. When the carriage ſtopped, two men appeared at the door, and aſſiſted us to alight; ſo gloomy were their countenances and ſo few their words, I almoſt fancied myſelf again in the convent. Certain it is, I had not ſeen ſuch melancholy faces ſince I quitted it. Is this a part of the world I have ſo fondly contemplated? ſaid I.</p>
                     <p>"The interior appearance of the houſe was deſolate and mean; I was ſurpriſed that my father had choſen ſuch a place for his habitation, and alſo that no woman was to be ſeen; but I knew that inquiry would only produce a reproof, and was therefore ſilent. At ſupper, the two men I had before ſeen ſat down with us; they ſaid little, but ſeemed to obſerve me much. I was confuſed and diſpleaſed, which, my father noticing, frowned at them with a look, which convinced me he meant more than I comprehended. When the cloth was drawn, my father took my hand and conducted me to the door of my chamber; having ſet down the candle, and wiſhed me good night, he left me to my own ſolitary thoughts.</p>
                     <p>"How different were they from thoſe I had indulged a few hours before! then expectation, hope, delight, danced before me; now melancholy and diſappointment chilled the ardour of my mind, and diſcoloured my future proſpect. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of every thing around conduced to depreſs me. On the floor lay a ſmall bed without curtains, or hangings; two old chairs and a table were all the remaining furniture in the room. I went to the window, with an intention of looking

out upon the ſurrounding ſcene, and found it was grated, I was ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ked at this circumſtance, and, comparing it with the lonely ſituation, and the ſtrange appearance of the houſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the countenances and behaviour of the men, who had ſupped with us, I was loſt in a labyrinth of conjecture.</p>
                     <p>"At length I lay down to ſleep; but the anxiety of my mind prevented repoſe, gloomy, unpleaſing images flitted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my fancy, and I fell into a ſort of waking dream: I thought that I was in a lonely foreſt with my father; his looks were ſevere, and his geſtures menacing: he upbraided me for leaving the convent, and while he ſpoke, drew from his pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et a mirror, which he held before my face; I looked in it and ſaw, (my blood now thrills as I repeat it) I ſaw myſelf woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and bleeding profuſely. Then I thought myſelf in the houſe again; and ſuddenly heard theſe words, in accents ſo diſtinct, that for ſome time after I awoke, I could ſcarcely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them ideal, "Depart this houſe, deſtruction hovers here."</p>
                     <p>"I was awakened by a footſtep on the ſtairs; it was my father retiring to his chamber; the lateneſs of the hour ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed me, for it was paſt midnight.</p>
                     <p>"On the following morning, the party of the preceding evening aſſembled at breakfaſt, and were as gloomy and ſilent as before. The table was ſpread by a boy of my father's; but the cook and the houſe-maid, whatever they might be were inviſible."</p>
                     <p>"The next morning, I was ſurpriſed, on attempting to leave my chamber, to find the door locked; I waited a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time before I ventured to call; when I did, no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was returned; I then went to the window, and called more loudly, but my own voice was ſtill the only ſound I heard. Near an hour I paſſed in a ſtate of ſurpriſe and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror not to be deſcribed: at length, I heard a perſon coming up ſtai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, and I renewed the call; I was anſwered, that my father had that morning ſat off for Paris, whence he would return in a few days; in the mean while he had ordered me to be confined in my chamber. On my expreſſing ſurpriſe and apprehenſion at this circumſtance, I was aſſured I had nothing to fear, and that I ſhould live as well as if I was at liberty."</p>
                     <p>"The latter part of this ſpeech ſeemed to contain an odd kind of comfort; I made little reply, but ſubmitted to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. Once more I was abandoned to ſorrowful reflection; what a day was the one I now paſſed! alone, and agitated
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029379_0021_0FE089CC1106FA70"/>
with grief and apprehenſion. I endeavoured to conjecture the cauſe of this harſh treatment; and, at length concluded it was deſigned by my father, as a puniſhment for my former diſobedience. But why abandon me to the power of ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to men, whoſe countenances bore the ſtamp of villany ſo ſtrongly as to impreſs even my inexperienced mind with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror! Surmiſe involved me only deeper in perplexity, yet I found it impoſſible to forbear purſuing the ſubject; and the day was divided between lamentation and conjecture. Night at length came, and ſuch a night! Darkneſs brought new terrors: I looked round the chamber for ſome means of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening my door on the inſide, but could perceive none; at laſt I contrived to place the back of a chair in an oblique di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſo as to render it ſecure.</p>
                     <p>"I had ſcarcely done this, and laid down upon my bed in my clothes, not to ſleep, but to watch, when I heard a rap at the door of the houſe, which was opened and ſhut ſo quickly, that the perſon who had knocked, ſeemed only to deliver a letter or meſſage. Soon after, I heard voices at intervals in a room below ſtairs, ſometimes ſpeaking very low, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times riſing, all together, as if in diſpute. Something more excuſable than curioſity made me endeavour to diſtinguiſh what was ſaid, but in vain; now and then a word or two reached me, and once I heard my name repeated, but no more."</p>
                     <p>"Thus paſſed the hours till midnight, when all became ſtill. I had laid for ſome time in a ſtate between fear and hope, when I heard the lock of my door gently moved backward and forward; I ſtarted up, and liſtened; for a moment it was ſtill, then the noiſe returned, and I heard a whiſpering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; my ſpirits died away, but I was yet ſenſible. Preſently an effort was made at the door, as if to force it; I ſhrieked aloud, and immediately heard the voices of the men I had ſeen at my father's table: they called loudly for the door to be opened, and on my returning no anſwer, uttered dreadful exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations. I had juſt ſtrength ſufficient to move to the window, in the deſperate hope of eſcaping thence; but my feeble efforts could not even ſhake the bars. O! how can I recollect theſe moments of horror, and be ſufficiently thankful that I am now in ſafety and comfort!</p>
                     <p>"They remained ſome time at the door, then they quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and went down ſtairs. How my heart revived at ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſtep of their departure; I fell upon my knees, thanked
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029379_0022_0FE089D81E4AE5E8"/>
God that he had preſerved me this time, and implored his farther protection. I was riſing from this ſhort prayer, when ſuddenly I heard a noiſe in a different part of the ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m, and on looking round, I perceived the door of a ſmall cloſet, open, and two men enter the chamber.</p>
                     <p>"They ſeized me, and I ſunk ſenſeleſs in their arms; how long I remained in this condition I know not, but on reviving, I perceived myſelf again alone, and heard ſeveral voices from below ſtairs, I had preſence of mind to run to the door of the cloſet, my only chance of eſcape: but it was locked! I then recollected it was poſſible, that the ruffians might have forgot to turn the key of the chamber door, which was held by the chair; but here, alſo, I was diſappointed. I claſped my hands in an agony of deſpair, and ſtood for ſome time immovable.</p>
                     <p>"A violent noiſe from below rouſed me, and ſoon after I heard people aſcending the ſtairs: I now gave myſelf up for loſt. The ſteps approached, the door of the cloſet was again unlocked. I ſtood calmly, and again ſaw the men enter the chamber; I neither ſpoke nor reſiſted: the faculties of my ſoul were wrought up beyond the power of feeling; as a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent blow on the body ſtuns for a while the ſenſe of pain. They led me down ſtairs; the door of a room below was thrown open, and I beheld a ſtranger; it was then that my ſenſes returned; I ſhrieked and reſiſted, but was forced along. It is unneceſſary to ſay that this ſtranger was Monſieur La Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, or to add, that I ſhall for ever bleſs him as my deliverer."</p>
                     <p>Adeline ceaſed to ſpeak; Madame La Motte remained ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. There were ſome circumſtances in Adeline's narrative, which raiſed all her curioſity. She aſked if Adeline believed her father to be a party in this myſterious affair. Adeline, thought it was impoſſible to doubt that he had been princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally and materially concerned in ſome part of it, thought, or ſaid ſhe thought, he was innocent of any intention againſt her life. "Yet, what motive." ſaid Madame La Motte, "could there be for a degree of cruelty ſo apparently unprofitable?" Here the inquiry ended; and Adeline confeſſed ſhe had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued it, till her mind ſhrunk from all farther reſearch.</p>
                     <p>The ſympathy which ſuch uncommon misfortune excited, Madame La Motte now expreſſed without reſerve, and this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of it, ſtrengthened the tye of mutual friendſhip Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eline felt her ſpirit relieved by the diſcloſure ſhe had made to Madame La Motte; and the latter acknowledged the value of the confidence, by an increaſe of affectionate attentions.</p>

                     <p>LA Motte had now paſſed above a month in this ſecluſion; and his wife had the pleaſure to ſee him recover tranquillity and even cheerfulneſs. In this pleaſure Adeline warmly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated; and ſhe might juſtly have congratulated herſelf, as one cauſe of his reſtoration; her cheerfulneſs and delicate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention had affected what Madame La Motte's greater anxiety had failed to accompliſh. La Motte did not ſeem regardleſs of her amiable diſpoſition, and ſometimes thanked her in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more earneſt than was uſual with him. She, in her turn, conſidered him as her only protector, and now felt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him the affection of a daughter.</p>
                     <p>The time ſhe had ſpent in this peaceful retirement had ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened the remembrance of paſt events, and reſtored her mind to its natural tone; and when memory brought back to her view her former ſhort and romantic expectations of happineſs, though ſhe gave a ſigh to the rapturous illuſion, ſhe leſs lamented the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, than rejoiced in her preſent ſecurity and comfort.</p>
                     <p>But the ſatisfaction which La Motte's cheerfulneſs diffuſed around him was of ſhort continuance; he became ſuddenly gloomy and reſerved; the ſociety of his family was no longer grateful to him; and he would ſpend whole hours in the moſt ſecluded parts of the foreſt, devoted to melancholy and ſecret grief. He did not, as formerly, indulge the humour of his ſadneſs, without reſtraint, in the preſence of others; he now evidently endeavoured to conceal it, and affected a cheerfulneſs that was too artificial to eſcape detection.</p>
                     <p>His ſervant Peter either impelled by curioſity or kindneſs, ſometimes followed him unſeen into the foreſt. He obſerved him frequently retire to one particular ſpot, in a remote part, which having gained, he always diſappeared before Peter,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029379_0023_0FE089DE0F52ED88"/>
who was obliged to follow at a diſtance, could exactly notice, where. All his endeavours, now prompted by wonder and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated by diſappointment, were unſucceſsful, and he was at length compelled to endure the tortures of unſatisfied curioſity.</p>
                     <p>This change in the manners and habits of her huſband was too conſpicuous to paſs unobſerved by Madame La Motte, who endeavoured, by all the ſtratagems which affection could ſuggeſt, or female invention ſupply, to win him to her confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He ſeemed inſenſible to the influence of the firſt, and withſtood the wiles of the latter. Finding all her efforts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to diſſipate the glooms which overhung his mind, or to penetrate their ſecret cauſe, ſhe deſiſted from farther attempt, and endeavoured to ſubmit to this myſterious diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Week after week elapſed, and the ſame unknown cauſe ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the lips and corroded the heart of La Motte. The place of his viſitation in the foreſt had not been traced. Peter had frequently examined round the ſpot where his maſter diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, but had never diſcovered any receſs which could be ſuppoſed to conceal him. The aſtoniſhment of the ſervant was at length raiſed to an inſupportable degree, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his miſtreſs the ſubject of it.</p>
                     <p>The emotion, which this information excited, ſhe diſguiſed from Peter, and reproved him for the means he had taken to gratify his curioſity. But ſhe revolved this circumſtance in her thoughts, and comparing it with the late alteration in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, her uneaſineſs was renewed, and her perplexity conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly increaſed. After much conſideration, being unable to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign any other motive for his conduct, ſhe began to attribute it to the influence of illicit paſſion; and her heart, which now out-ran her judgment, confirmed the ſuppoſition, and rouſed all the torturing pangs of jealouſy.</p>
                     <p>Comparatively ſpeaking, ſhe had never known affliction till now: ſhe had abandoned her deareſt friends and connections— had relinquiſhed the gaieties, the luxuries, and almoſt the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life;—fled with her family into exile, an exile the moſt dreary and comfortleſs; experiencing the evils of reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thoſe of apprehenſion, united: all theſe ſhe had patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endured, ſupported by the affection of him, for whoſe ſake ſhe ſuffered. Though that affection, indeed, had for ſome time appeared to be abated, ſhe had borne its decreaſe with fortitude: but the laſt ſtroke of calamity, hitherto withheld, now came with irreſiſtible force—the love of which ſhe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the loſs, ſhe now believed was transferred to another.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:029379_0023_0FE089DE0F52ED88"/>The operation of ſtrong paſſion confuſes the powers of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and warps them on its own particular direction. Her uſual degree of judgment, unoppoſed by the influence of her heart, would probably have pointed out to Madame La Motte ſome circumſtances upon the ſubject of her diſtreſs, equivocal, if not contradictory to her ſuſpicions. No ſuch circumſtances appeared to her, and ſhe did not long heſitate to decide, that Adeline was the object of her huſband's attachment. Her beauty out of the queſtion, who elſe, indeed, could it be in a ſpot thus ſecluded from the world?</p>
                     <p>The ſame cauſe deſtroyed, almoſt at the ſame moment, her only remaining comfort; and, when ſhe wept that ſhe could no longer look for happineſs in the affection of La Motte, ſhe wept alſo, that ſhe could no longer ſeek ſolace in the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Adeline. She had too great an eſteem for her to doubt, at firſt, the integrity of her conduct, but, in ſpite of reaſon, her heart no longer expanded to her with its uſual warmth of kindneſs. She ſhrunk from her confidence; and as the ſecret broodings of jealouſy cheriſhed her ſuſpicions, ſhe became leſs kind to her, even in manner.</p>
                     <p>Adeline, obſerving the change, at firſt attributed it to acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and afterwards to a temporary diſpl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ſure, ariſing from ſome little inadvertency in her conduct. She therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed her aſſiduities; but, perceiving, contrary to all expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that her efforts to pleaſe failed of their uſual conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and that the reſerve of Madame's manner rather increaſed than abated, ſhe became ſeriouſly uneaſy, and reſolved to ſeek an explanation. This Madame La Motte as ſedulouſly avoided, and was for ſome time able to prevent. Adeline, however, too much intereſted in the event to yield to delicate ſcruples preſſed the ſubject ſo cloſely, that Madame, at firſt agitated and confuſed, at length invented ſome idle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and laughed off the affair.</p>
                     <p>She now ſaw the neceſſity of ſubduing all appearance of reſerve towards Adeline; and though her art could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the prejudices of paſſion, it taught her to aſſume, with tolerable ſucceſs, the aſpect of kindneſs. Adeline was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and was again at peace. Indeed, confidence in the ſincerity and goodneſs of others was her weakneſs. But the pangs of ſtifled jealouſy ſtruck deeper to the heart of Madame La Motte, and ſhe reſolved, at all events, to obtain ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty upon the ſubject of her ſuſpicions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="46" facs="unknown:029379_0024_0FE089EDB485E470"/>She now condeſcended to a meanneſs, which ſhe had before deſpiſed, and ordered Peter to watch the ſteps of his maſter, in order to diſcover, if poſſible, the place of his viſitation! So much did paſſion win upon her judgment, by time and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that ſhe ſometimes ventured even to doubt the integrity of Adeline, and afterwards proceeded to believe it poſſible that the object of La Motte's rambles might be an aſſignation with her. What ſuggeſted this conjecture was, that Adeline frequently took long walks alone in the foreſt, and ſometimes was abſent from the abbey for many hours. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which Madame La Motte had at firſt attributed to Adeline's fondneſs for the pictureſque beauties of nature, now operated forcibly upon her imagination, and ſhe could view it in no other light, than as affording an opportunity for ſecret converſation with her huſband.</p>
                     <p>Peter obeyed the orders of his miſtreſs with alacrity, for they were warmly ſeconded by his own curioſity. All his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were, however, fruitleſs; he never dared to follow La Motte near enough to obſerve the place of his laſt retreat. Her impatience thus heightened by delay, and her paſſion ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulated by difficulty, Madame La Motte now reſolved to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to her huſband for an explanation of his conduct.</p>
                     <p>After ſome conſideration, concerning the manner moſt likely to ſucceed with him, ſhe went to La Motte, but when ſhe entered the room where he ſat, forgetting all her concerted addreſs, ſhe fell at his feet, and was, for ſome moments, loſt in tears. Surpriſed at her attitude and diſtreſs, he inquired the occaſion of it, and was anſwered, that it was cauſed by his own conduct. "My conduct! What part of it, pray? inquired he.</p>
                     <p>"Your reſerve, your ſecret ſorrow, and frequent abſcence from the abbey."</p>
                     <p>"Is it then ſo wonderful, that a man, who has loſt almoſt every thing, ſhould ſometimes lament his misfortunes? or ſo criminal to attempt concealing his grief, that he muſt be blamed for it by thoſe, whom he would ſave from the pain of ſharing it?"</p>
                     <p>Having uttered theſe words, he quitted the room, leaving Madame La Motte loſt in ſurprize, but ſomewhat relieved from the preſſure of her former ſuſpicions. Still, however, ſhe, purſued Adeline with an eye of ſcrutiny; and the maſk of kindneſs would ſometimes fall off, and diſcover the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:029379_0024_0FE089EDB485E470"/>
of diſtruſt. Adeline, without exactly knowing why, felt leſs at eaſe and leſs happy in her preſence than formerly; her ſpirits drooped, and ſhe would often, when alone, weep at the forlornneſs of her condition. Formerly, her remembrance of paſt ſufferings was loſt in the friendſhip of Madame La Motte; now, though her behaviour was too guarded to betray any ſtriking inſtance of unkindneſs, there was ſomething in her manner which chilled the hopes of Adeline, unable as ſhe was to analyze it. But a circumſtance, which ſoon occurred, ſuſpended, for a while, the jealouſy of Madame La Motte, and rouſed her huſband from his ſtate of gloomy ſtupefaction.</p>
                     <p>Peter, having been one day to Auboine, for the weekly ſupply of proviſions, returned with intelligence that awakened in La Motte new apprehenſion and anxiety.</p>
                     <p>"Oh, Sir, I've heard ſomething that has aſtoniſhed me, as well it may, "cried Peter," and ſo it will you, when you come to know it. As I was ſtanding in the blackſmith's ſhop, while the ſmith was driving a nail into the horſe's ſhoe (by the bye, the horſe loſt it in an odd way, I'll tell you, Sir, how it was)"—</p>
                     <p>"Nay, prithee leave it till another time, and go on with your ſtory?"</p>
                     <p>"Why then, Sir, as I was ſtanding in the blackſmith's ſhop, comes in a man with a pipe in his mouth, and a large pouch of tobacco in his hand"—</p>
                     <p>"Well—what has the pipe to do with the ſtory?"</p>
                     <p>"Nay, Sir, you put me out; I can't go on, unleſs you let me tell it my own way. As I was ſaying — with a pipe in his mouth—I think I was there, your Honour!"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes."</p>
                     <p>"He ſet himſelf down on the bench, and, taking the pipe from his mouth, ſays to the blackſmith—Neighbour, do you know any body of the name of La Motte hereabouts?—Bleſs your Honour, I turned all of a cold ſweat in a minute! Is not your Honour well, ſhall I fetch you any thing?</p>
                     <p>"No—but be ſhort in your narrative."</p>
                     <p>"La Motte! La Motte! ſaid the blackſmith, I think I've heard the name." — "Have you?" ſaid I, "you're cunning then, for there's no ſuch perſon hereabouts, to my knowledge."</p>
                     <p>"Fool! why did you ſay that?"</p>
                     <p>"Becauſe I did not want them to know your Honour was here; and if I had not managed very cleverly, they would

have found me out. There is no ſuch perſon, hereabouts, to my knowledge," ſays I.—"Indeed! ſays the blackſmith, you know more of the neighbourhood than I do thee."—"Aye," ays the man with the pipe "that's very true. How came you to know ſo much of the neighbourhood? I came here twenty-ſix years ago, come next St. Michael, and you know more than I do. How came you to know ſo much?"</p>
                     <p>"With that he put his pipe in his mouth, and gave a whiff full in my face. Lord! your Honour, I trembled from head to foot. Nay, as for that matter, ſays I, I don't know more than other people, but I'm ſure I never heard of ſuch a man as that."—Pray, ſays the blackſmith, ſtaring me full in the face, an't you the man that was inquiring ſome time ſince about St. Clair's Abbey?"—"Well, what of that? ſays I, what does that prove?"—Why, they ſay, ſomebody lives in the abbey now, ſaid the man, turning to the other; and, for aught I know it may be this ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I'll lay my life on't, this Monſieur La Motte lives at the abbey,"—Aye, ſays I, you are out there, for he does not live at the abbey now."</p>
                     <p>"Confound your folly!" cried La Motte, but be quick— how did the matter end?"</p>
                     <p>"My maſter does not live there now, ſaid I.—Oh! oh! ſaid the man with the pipe; he is your maſter, then? And pray how long has he left the abbey—and where does he live now? Hold ſaid I, not ſo faſt—I know when to ſpeak and when to hold my tongue—but who has been inquiring for him?"</p>
                     <p>"What! he expected ſomebody to inquire for him" ſays the man—"No," ſays I, "he did not, but if he did, what does that prove?—that argues nothing." With that he looked at the blackſmith, and they went out of the ſhop together, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my horſe's ſhoe undone. But I never minded that for the moment they were gone I mounted, and rode away as faſt as I could. But in my fright, your Honour, I forgot to take the round about way, and ſo came ſtraight home."</p>
                     <p>La Motte, extremely ſhocked at Peter's intelligence, made no other reply than by curſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>n his information by preface. "We are diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:029379_0025_0FE089F24C332370"/>
ſaid he, "the King's officers have been inquiring for me at Auboine, and Peter has plundered upon my ruin." He then informed her of what Peter had related, and bade her prepare to quit the abbey.</p>
                     <p>"But whither can we fly?" ſaid Madame La Motte, ſcarcely able to ſupport herſelf. "Any where!" ſaid he, "to ſtay here is certain deſtruction. We muſt take refuge in Switzerland, I think. If any part of France would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed me, ſurely it had been this!"</p>
                     <p>"Alas, how are we perſecuted!" rejoined Madame. "This ſpot is ſcarcely made comfortable, before we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to leave it, and go we know not whither."</p>
                     <p>"I wiſh we may not yet know whither," replied La Motte, "that is the leaſt evil that threatens us. Let us eſcape a priſon, and I care not whither we go. But return to the abbey immediately, and pack up what moveables you can." A flood of tears came to the relief of Madame La Motte, and ſhe hung upon Adeline's arm ſilent and trembling. Adeline, though ſhe had no comfort to beſtow, endeavoured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her feelings and appear compoſed. "Come," ſaid La Motte, "we waſte time; let us lament hereafter, but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent prepare for flight. Exert a little of that fortitude, which is ſo neceſſary for our preſervation. Adeline does not weep, yet her ſtate is as wretched as your own, for I know not how long I ſhall be able to protect her."</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding her terror, this reproof touched the pride of Madame La Motte, who dried her tears, but diſdained to reply, and looked at Adeline with a ſtrong expreſſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. As they moved ſilently toward the abbey, Adeline aſked La Motte if he was ſure they were the king's officers, who inquired for him. "I cannot doubt it," he replied, "who elſe could poſſibly inquire for me? Beſides the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the man, who mentioned my name, puts the matter beyond a queſtion."</p>
                     <p>"Perhaps not, ſaid Madame La Motte: let us wait till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ere we ſet off. We may then find it will be unneceſſary to go."</p>
                     <p>"We may, indeed; the king's officers would probably by that time have told us as much." —La Motte went to give or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Peter. "Set off in an hour," ſaid Peter. "Lord bleſs you, maſter! only conſider the coach wheel; it would take me a day at leaſt to mend it, for your Honour knows I never mended one in my life."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="50" facs="unknown:029379_0026_0FE089FCDE3F6C68"/>This was a circumſtance which La Motte had entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked. When they ſettled at the abbey, Peter had at firſt been too buſy in repairing the apartments, to remember the carriage, and afterwards believing it would not quickly be wanted, he had neglected to do it. La Motte's temper now entirely forſook him, and with many execrations ordered Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to go to work immediately: but on ſearching for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials formerly bought, they were no where to be found, and Peter at length remembered, though he was prudent enough to conceal this circumſtance, that he had uſed the nails in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the abbey.</p>
                     <p>It was now, therefore, impoſſible to quit the foreſt that night, and La Motte had only to conſider the moſt probable plan of concealment, ſhould the officers of juſtice viſit the ruin before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e morning; a circumſtance, which the thoughtleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Peter in returning from Auboine by the ſtraight way made not unlikely.</p>
                     <p>At firſt, indeed, it occurred to him, that though his family could not be removed, he might himſelf take one of the horſes and eſcape from the foreſt before night. But he thought there would ſtill be ſome danger of detection in the towns through which he muſt paſs, and he could not well bear the idea of leaving his family unprotected, without knowing when he could return to them, or whither he could direct them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. La Motte was not a man of very vigorous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he was, perhaps, rather more willing to ſuffer i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> company than alone.</p>
                     <p>After much conſideration, he recollected the trap-door of the cloſet belonging to the chambers above. It was inviſible to the eye, and whatever might be its direction, it would ſecurely ſhelter <hi>him,</hi> at leaſt from diſcovery. Having deliberated far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the ſubject, he determined to explore the receſs t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> which the ſtairs led, and thought it poſſible, that for a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He called for a light and aſcended alone to the chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When he came to the cloſet, it was ſome time before he could find the trap-door, ſo exactly did it correſpond with the boards of the floor. At length, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound and raiſed it. The
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:029379_0026_0FE089FCDE3F6C68"/>
chill damps of long confined air ruſhed from the aperture, and he ſtood for a moment to let them paſs, ere he deſcended. As he ſtood looking down the abyſs, he recollected the report, which Peter had brought concerning the abbey, and it gave him an uneaſy ſenſation: But this ſoon yielded to more preſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intereſts.</p>
                     <p>The ſtairs were ſteep, and in many places trembled beneath his weight. Having continued to deſcend for ſome time, his feet touched the ground, and he found himſelf in a narrow paſſage; but as he turned to purſue it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the damp vapours curled round him and extinguiſhed the light. He called aloud for Peter, but could make no body hear, and after ſome time, he endeavoured to find his way up the ſtairs. In this, with difficulty, he ſucceeded, and paſſing the chambers with cautious ſteps, deſcended the tower.</p>
                     <p>The ſecurity which the place he had juſt quitted ſeemed to promiſe, was of too much importance to be ſlightly rejected, and he determined immediately to make another experiment with the light:—having now fixed it in a lanthorn, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended a ſecond time to the paſſage. The current of vapours occaſioned by the opening of the trap door, was abated, and the freſh air thence admitted had begun to circulate: La Motte paſſed on unmoleſted.</p>
                     <p>The paſſage was of conſiderable length, and led him to a door, which was faſtened. He placed the lanthorn at ſome diſtance to avoid the current of air, and applied his ſtrength to the door. It ſhook under his hands but did not yield. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examinig it more cloſely, he perceived the wood round the lock was decayed, probably by the damps, and this encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to proceed. After ſome time it gave way to his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and he found himſelf in a ſquare ſtone room.</p>
                     <p>He ſtood for ſome time to ſurvey it. The walls, which were dripping with unwholeſome dews, were entirely bare and afforded not even a window. A ſmall iron grate alone admitted the air. At the further end, near a low receſs, was another door. La Motte went towards it, and as he paſſed, looked into the receſs. Upon the ground within it, ſtood a large cheſt, which he went forward to examine, and lifting the lid, he ſaw the remains of a human ſkeleton. Horror ſtruck upon his heart, and he involuntarily ſtepped back. During a pauſe of ſome moments, his firſt emotions ſubſided. That thrilling curioſity, which objects of terror often excite
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:029379_0027_0FE08A028235AC80"/>
in the human mind, impelled him to take a ſecond view of this diſmal ſpectacle.</p>
                     <p>La Motte ſtood motionleſs as he gazed; the object be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him ſeemed to confirm the report that ſome perſon had formerly been murdered in the abbey. At length he cloſed the cheſt and advanced to the ſecond door, which alſo was faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, but the key was in the lock. He turned it with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and then found the door was held by two ſtrong bolts. Having undrawn theſe, it diſcloſed a flight of ſteps, which he deſcended. They terminated in a chain of low vaults, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cells, that, from the manner of their conſtruction and preſent condition, ſeemed to have been coeval with the moſt ancient parts of the abbey. La Motte, in his then depreſſed ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e of mind, thought them the burial places of the monks, who formerly inhabited the pile above, but they were more calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for places of penance for the living than of reſt for the dead.</p>
                     <p>Having reached the extremity of theſe cells, the way was again cloſed by a door. La Motte now heſitated whether he ſhould attempt to proceed any farther. The preſent ſpot ſeemed to afford the ſecurity he ſought. Here he might paſs the night unmoleſted by apprehenſion of diſcovery, and it was moſt probable, that if the officers arrived in the night, and found the abbey vaca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed, they would quit it before morning, or at leaſt before he could have any occaſion to emerge from concealment. Theſe conſiderations reſtored his mind to a ſtate of greater compoſure. His only immediate care was to bring his family as ſoon as poſſible to this place of ſecurity leſt the officers ſhould come unawares upon them; and while he ſtood thus muſing, he blamed himſelf for delay.</p>
                     <p>But an irreſiſtable deſire of knowing to what this door led, arreſted his ſteps, and he turned to open it. The door howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was faſtened, and as he attempted to force it, he ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought he heard a noiſe above. It now occurred to him, that the officers might already have arrived, and he quitted the cells with precipitation, intending to liſten at the trap-door.</p>
                     <p>"There, ſaid he, I may wait in ſecurity, and perhaps hear ſomething of what paſſes. My family will not be known, or at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Theſe were the arguments of La Motte, in which it muſt be owned, ſelfiſh prudence was more conſpicuous than tender anxiety for his wife. He had by this time reached the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:029379_0027_0FE08A028235AC80"/>
of the ſtairs, when on looking up he perceived the trap-door was left open, and aſcending in haſte to cloſe it, he heard footſteps advancing through the chamber above. Before he could aſcend entirely out of ſight, he again looked up and perceived through the aperture the face of a man looking down upon him. "Maſter," cried Peter;—La Motte was ſomewhat relieved at the ſound of his voice, though angry that he had occaſioned him ſo much terror.</p>
                     <p>"What brings you here and what is the matter below?"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing, Sir, nothing's the matter, only my miſtreſs ſent me to ſee after your Honour."</p>
                     <p>"There's nobody there then," ſaid La Motte," ſetting his foot upon the ſtep."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Sir, there is my miſtreſs and Mademoiſelle Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and—"</p>
                     <p>"Well—well" ſaid La Motte briſkly—"go your ways, I am coming."</p>
                     <p>"He informed Madame La Motte where he had been, and of his intention of ſecreting himſelf, and deliberated upon the means of convincing the officers, ſhould they arrive, time he had quitted the abbey. For this purpoſe, he ordered all the moveable furniture to be conveyed to the cells below. La Motte himſelf aſſiſted in this buſineſs, and every hand was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for diſpatch. In a very ſhort time, the habitable part of the fabric was left almoſt as deſolate as he had found it. He then bade Peter take the horſes to a diſtance from the abbey, and turn them looſe. After farther conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, he thought it might contribute to miſlead them, if he placed in ſome conſpicuous part of the fabric an inſcription, ſignifying his condition, and mentioning the date of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the abbey. Over the door of the tower which led to the habitable part of the ſtructure, he therefore, cut the following lines.</p>

into a baſket, and La Motte having aſſembled his family, they all aſcended the ſtairs of the tower and paſſed through the chambers to the cloſet. Peter went firſt with a light, and with ſome difficulty found the trap-door. Madame La Motte ſhuddered as ſhe ſurveyed the gloomy abyſs; but they were all ſilent.</p>

                     <p>"There is no harm in loving good wine, as your Honour knows."</p>
                     <p>"Have done with this buffoonery," ſaid La Motte, in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>one more authoritative, "and go firſt." Peter obeyed.</p>
                     <p>They came to the vaulted room. The diſmal ſpectacle he had ſeen there, deterred La Motte from paſſing the night in this chamber; and the furniture had, by his own order, been conveyed to the cells below. He was anxious that his family ſhould not perceive the ſkeleton; an object which would probably excite a degree of horror not to be overcome during their ſtay. La Motte now paſſed the cheſt in haſte; and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame La Motte and Adeline were too much engroſſed by their own thoughts, to give minute attention to external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>When they reached the cells, Madame La Motte wept at the neceſſity which condemned her to a ſpot ſo diſmal, "Alas," ſaid ſhe, "are we indeed, thus reduced! The apartments above, formerly appeared to me a deplorable habitation; but they are a palace compared to theſe."</p>
                     <p>"True, my dear," ſaid La Motte, "and let the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of what you once thought them, ſoothe your diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent now; theſe cells are alſo a palace, compared to the Bicétre, or the Baſtile, and to the terrors of farther puniſhment, which would accompany them: let the apprehenſion of the greater evil teach you to endure the leſs: I am contented if we find here the refuge I ſeek."</p>
                     <p>Madame La Motte was ſilent, and Adeline, forgetting her late unkindneſs, endeavoured as much as ſhe could to conſole her; while her heart was ſinking with the misfortunes, which
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:029379_0028_0FE08A0F74537260"/>
ſhe could not but anticipate, ſhe appeared compoſed and even cheerful. She attended Madame La Motte with the moſt watchful ſolicitude, and felt ſo thankful that La Motte was now ſecreted within this receſs, that ſhe almoſt loſt her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of its glooms and inconveniences.</p>
                     <p>This ſhe artleſsly expreſſed to him, who could not be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the tenderneſs it diſcovered. Madame La Motte was alſo ſenſible of it, and it renewed a painful ſenſation. The effuſions of gratitude ſhe miſtook for thoſe of tenderneſs.</p>
                     <p>La Motte returned frequently to the trap-door, to liſten if any body was in the abbey; but no ſound diſturbed the ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of night; at length they ſat down to ſupper; the repaſt was a melancholy one "If the officers do not come hither to night," ſaid Madame La Motte, ſighing, "ſuppoſe, my dear, Peter returns to Auboine to morrow. He may there learn ſomething more of this affair; or at leaſt, he might procure a carriage to convey us hence."</p>
                     <p>"To be ſure he might, ſaid La Motte peeviſhly, and people to attend it alſo. Peter would be an excellent perſon to ſhew the officers the way to the abbey, and to inform them of what they might elſe be in doubt about my concealment here."</p>
                     <p>"How cruel is this irony!" replyed Madame La Motte, "I propoſed only what I thought would be for our mutual good; my judgment was, perhaps, wrong, but my intention was certainly right." Tears ſwelled into her eyes as ſhe ſpoke theſe words. Adeline wiſhed to relieve her; but delicacy kept her ſilent. La Motte obſerved the effect of his ſpeech and ſomething like remorſe touched his heart. He approached, and taking her hand, "You muſt allow for the perturbation, of my mind," ſaid he, "I did not mean to afflict you thus. The idea of ſending Peter to Auboine, where he has already done ſo much harm by his blunders, teaſed me, and I could not let it paſs unnoticed. No, my dear, our only chance of ſafety is to remain where we are while our proviſions laſt. If the officers do not come here to night, they probably will to morrow, or perhaps, the next day. When they have ſearched the abbey, without finding me, they will depart; we may then emerge from this receſs, and take meaſures for removing to a diſtant country."</p>
                     <p>Madame La Motte acknowledged the juſtice of his words, and her mind being relieved by the little apology he had made, ſhe became tolerably cheerful. Supper being ended,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:029379_0029_0FE08A15CF17B560"/>
La Motte ſtationed the faithful, though ſimple Peter, at the foot of the ſteps that aſcended to the cloſet; there to keep watch during the night. Having done this, he returned to the lower cells, where he had left his little family. The beds were ſpread, and having mournfully bid each other good night, they laid down and implored reſt.</p>
                     <p>Adeline's thoughts were too buſy to ſuffer her to repoſe, and when ſhe believed her companions were ſunk in ſlumbers, ſhe indulged the ſorrow which reflection brought. She alſo looked forward to the future with the moſt mournful apprehenſion. "Should La Motte be ſeized, what was to become of her? She would then be a wanderer in the wide world; without friends to protect, or money to ſupport her; the proſpect was gloomy—was terrible!" She ſurveyed it and ſhuddered! The diſtreſſes too of Monſieur and Madame La Motte, whom ſhe lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt lively affection, formed no inconſiderable part of her's.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes ſhe looked back to her father; but in him ſhe only ſaw an enemy, from whom ſhe muſt fly; this remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance heightened her ſorrow; yet it was not the recollection of the ſuffering he had occaſioned her, by which ſhe was ſo much afflicted, as by the ſenſe of his unkindneſs: ſhe wept bitterly. At length, with that artleſs piety, which innocence only knows, ſhe addreſſed the Supreme Being, and reſigned herſelf to his care. Her mind then gradually became peaceful and re-aſſured, and ſoon after ſhe ſunk to repoſe.</p>

                     <p>THE night paſſed without any alarm; Peter had remained upon his poſt, and heard nothing that prevented his ſleeping. La Motte heard him, long before he ſaw him, moſt muſically ſnoring; though it muſt be owned, there was more of the baſs than of any other part of the gamut in his performance. He was ſoon rouſed by the <hi>bravura</hi> of La Motte, whoſe notes ſounded diſcord to his ears, and deſtroyed ſhe torpor of his tranquillity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="unknown:029379_0029_0FE08A15CF17B560"/>"God bleſs you, Maſter, what's the matter?" cried Peter, waking, "are they come?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, for aught you care, they might be come. Did I place you here to ſleep, ſirrah?"</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs you, Maſter," returned Peter, "ſleep is the only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to be had here; I'm ſure I would not deny it to a dog in ſuch a place as this."</p>
                     <p>La Motte ſternly queſtioned him concerning any noiſe he might have heard in the night; and Peter full as ſolemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he had heard none; an aſſertion which was ſtrictly true, for he had enjoyed the comfort of being aſleep the whole time.</p>
                     <p>La Motte aſcended to the trap-door and liſtened attentively. No ſounds were heard, and as he ventured to lift it, the full light of the ſun burſt upon his ſight, the morning being now far advanced; he walked ſoftly along the chambers, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a window; no perſon was to be ſeen. Encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this apparent ſecurity, he ventured down the ſtairs of the tower, and entered the firſt apartment. He was proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the ſecond, when, ſuddenly recollecting himſelf, he firſt peeped through the crevice of the door, which ſtood half open. He looked, and diſtinctly ſaw a perſon ſitting near the window, upon which his arm reſted.</p>
                     <p>The diſcovery ſo much ſhocked him, that for a moment he loſt all preſence of mind, and was utterly unable to move from the ſpot. The perſon, whoſe back was towards him, aroſe, and turned his head. La Motte now recovered himſelf, and quitting the apartment as quickly, and at the ſame time, as ſilently as poſſible, aſcended to the cloſet. He raiſed the trap-door, but before he cloſed it, heard the footſteps of a perſon entering the outer chamber. Bolts, or other faſtening to the trap there was none; and his ſecurity depended ſolely upon the exact correſpondence of the boards. The outer door of the ſtone room had no means of defence; and the faſtenings of the inner one were on the wrong ſide to afford ſecurity, even till ſome means of eſcape could be found.</p>
                     <p>When he reached this room, he pauſed, and heard diſtinctly, perſons walking in the cloſet above. While he was liſtening he heard a voice call him by name, and he inſtantly fled to the cells below, expecting every moment to hear the trap lifted, and the footſteps of purſuit; but he was fled beyond the reach of hearing either. Having thrown himſelf on the ground, at the fartheſt extremity of the vaults, he lay for

ſome time breathleſs with agitation. Madame La Motte and Adeline, in the utmoſt terror, inquired what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. It was ſome time before he could ſpeak; when he did, it was almoſt unneceſſary, for the diſtant noiſes which founded from above informed his family of a part of the truth.</p>
                     <p>The ſounds did not ſeem to approach, but Madame La Motte, unable to command her terror, ſhrieked aloud: this redoubled the diſtreſs of La Motte. "You have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed me," cried he; "that ſhriek has informed them where I am." He traverſed the cells with claſped hands and quick ſteps. Adeline ſtood pale and ſtill as death, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Madame La Motte, whom, with difficulty, ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from fainting. "O! Dupras! Dupras! you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready avenged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" ſaid he, in a voice that ſeemed to burſt from his heart: there was a pauſe of ſilence. "But why ſhould I deceive myſelf with a hope of eſcaping?" he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, "why do I wait here for their coming? Let me rather end theſe torturing pangs by throwing myſelf into their hands at once."</p>
                     <p>As he ſpoke, he moved towards the door, but the diſtreſs of Madame La Motte arreſted his ſteps. "Stay," ſaid ſhe, "for my ſake, ſtay; do not leave me thus, nor throw your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf voluntarily into deſtruction!"</p>
                     <p>"Surely, Sir," ſaid Adeline, "you are too precipitate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this deſpair is uſeleſs, as it is ill-founded. We hear no perſon approaching; if the officers had diſcovered the trap-door, they would certainly have been here before now." The words of Adeline ſtilled the tumult of his mind: the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of terror ſubſided; and reaſon beamed a feeble ray upon his hopes. He liſtened attentively, and perceiving that all was ſilent, advanced with caution to the ſtone-room; and thence to the foot of the ſtairs that led to the trap-door. It was cloſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no ſound was heard above.</p>
                     <p>He watched a long time, and the ſilence continuing, his hopes ſtrengthened, and at length he began to believe that the officers had quitted the abbey; the day however was ſpent in anxious watchfulneſs. He did not dare to uncloſe the trap-door; and he frequently thought he heard diſtant noiſes. It was evident, however, that the ſecret of the cloſet had eſcaped diſcovery; and on this circumſtance he juſtly founded his ſecurity The following night was paſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:029379_0030_0FE08A2407E57FE8"/>But the neceſſities of hunger now threatened them. The proviſions which had been diſtributed with the niceſt economy, were nearly exhauſted, and the moſt deplorable conſequences might be expected from their remaining longer in conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus circumſtanced, La Motte deliberated upon the moſt prudent method of proceeding. There appeared no other alternative, than to ſend Peter to Auboine, the only town from which he could return within the time preſcribed by their neceſſities. There was game, indeed in the foreſt; but Peter could neither handle a gun, or uſe a fiſhing rod to any advantage.</p>
                     <p>It was, therefore, agreed he ſhould go to Auboine for a ſupply of proviſions, and at the ſame time bring materials for mending the coach-wheel, that they might have ſome ready conveyance from the foreſt. La Motte forbade Peter to aſk any queſtions concerning the people who had inquired for him, or take any methods for diſcovering whether they had quitted the country, leſt his blunders ſhould again betray him. He ordered him to be entirely ſilent as to theſe ſubjects, and leave the place with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>
                     <p>A difficulty yet remained to be overcome—Who ſhould firſt venture abroad into the abbey, to learn, whether it was vacated by the officers of juſtice? La Motte conſidered that if he was again ſeen, he ſhould be effectually betrayed; which would not be <hi>ſo</hi> certain, if one of his family was obſerved, for they were all unknown to the officers. It was neceſſary, however, that the perſon he ſent ſhould have courage enough to go through with the inquiry, and wit enough to conduct it with caution. Peter, perhaps, had the firſt; but was certainly deſtitute of the laſt. Annette had neither. La Motte looked at his wife, and aſked her, if, for his ſake, ſhe dared to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Her heart ſhrunk from the propoſal, yet ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to refuſe, or appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> indifferent upon a point ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the ſafety of her huſband. Adeline obſerved in her countenance the agitation of her mind, and ſurmounting the fears, which had hitherto kept her ſilent, ſhe offered herſelf to go.</p>
                     <p>"They will be leſs likely to offend me," ſaid ſhe, "than a man." Shame would not ſuffer La Motte to accept her offer; and Madame, touched by the magnanimity of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, felt a momentary renewal of all her former kindneſs. Adeline preſſed her propoſal ſo warmly, and ſeemed ſo much
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029379_0031_0FE08BA432A3DA18"/>
in earneſt, that La Motte began to heſitate. "You, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "once preſerved me from the moſt imminent danger, and your kindneſs has ſince protected me. Do not refuſe me the ſatisfaction of deſerving your goodneſs by a grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of it. Let me go into the abbey, and if, by ſo doing, I ſhould preſerve you from evil, I ſhall be ſufficiently rewarded for what little danger I may incur, for my pleaſure will be at leaſt equal to yours."</p>
                     <p>Madame La Motte could ſcarcely refrain from tears as Adeline ſpoke; and La Motte, ſighing deeply, ſaid, "Well, be it ſo; go, Adeline, and from this moment conſider me as your debtor." Adeline ſtayed not to reply, but taking a light, quitted the cells, La Motte following to raiſe the trap-door, and cautioning her to look, if poſſible, into every apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, before ſhe entered it. "If you <hi>ſhould</hi> be ſeen," ſaid he, "you muſt account for your appearance ſo as not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover me. Your own preſence of mind may aſſiſt you, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.—God bleſs you."</p>
                     <p>When ſhe was gone, Madame La Motte's admiraion of her conduct began to yield to other emotions. Diſtruſt gradually undermined kindneſs, and jealouſy raiſed ſuſpicions. "It muſt be a ſentiment more powerful than gratitude," thought ſhe, "that could teach Adeline to ſubdue her fears. What, but Love, could influence her to a conduct ſo generous!" Madame La Motte, when ſhe found it impoſſible to account for Adeline's conduct, without alledging ſome intereſted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for it, however her ſuſpicions might agree with the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the world, had ſurely forgotten how much ſhe once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired the purity and diſintereſtedneſs of her young friend.</p>
                     <p>Adeline, mean while, aſcended the chambers: the cheerful beams of the ſun played once more upon her ſight, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated her ſpirits; ſhe walked lightly through the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor ſtopped till ſhe came to the ſtairs of the tower. Here ſhe ſtood for ſome time, but no ſounds met her ear, ſave the ſighing of the wind among the trees, and, at length, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended. She paſſed the apartments below, without ſeeing any perſon; and the little furniture that remained, ſeemed to ſtand exactly as ſhe had left it. She now ventured to look out from the tower: the only animate objects, that appeared, were the deer, quietly grazing under the ſhade of the woods. Her favourite little fawn diſtinguiſhed Adeline, and came bounding towards her with ſtrong marks of joy. She was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029379_0031_0FE08BA432A3DA18"/>
what alarmed leſt the animal, being obſerved, ſhould betray her, and walked ſwiftly away through the cloiſters.</p>
                     <p>She opened the door that led to the great hall of the abbey, but the paſſage was ſo gloomy and dark that ſhe feared to enter it, and ſtarted back. It was neceſſary, however, that ſhe ſhould examine farther particularly on the oppoſite ſide of the ruin, of which ſhe had hitherto had no view: but her fears returned when ſhe recollected how far it would lead her from her only place of refuge, and how difficult it would be to retreat. She heſitated what to do: but when ſhe recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected her obligations to La Motte, and conſidered this as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps her only opportunity of doing him a ſervice, ſhe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to proceed.</p>
                     <p>As theſe thoughts paſſed rapidly over her mind, ſhe raiſed her innocent looks to heaven, and breathed a ſilent prayer. With trembling ſteps the proceeded over fragments of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, looking anxiouſly around, and often ſtarting as the breeze ruſtled among the trees, miſtaking it for the whiſperings of men. She came to the lawn which fronted the fabric, but no perſon was to be ſeen, and her ſpirits revived. The great door of the hall ſhe now endeavoured to open, but ſuddenly remembering that it was faſtened by La Mote's orders, ſhe proceeded to the north end of the abbey, and having ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the proſpect around as far as the thick foliage of the trees would permit, without perceiving any perſon, ſhe turned her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Adeline was now light of heart, and returned with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to inform La Motte of his ſecurity. In the cloiſters ſhe was again met by her little favourite, and ſtopped for a moment to careſs it. The fawn ſeemed ſenſible to the ſound of her voice, and diſcovered new joy; but while ſhe ſpoke, it ſuddenly ſtarted from her hand, and looking up ſhe perceived the door of the paſſage, leading to the great hall open, and a man in the habit of a ſoldier iſſue forth.</p>
                     <p>With the ſwiftneſs of an arrow ſhe fled along the cloiſters, nor once ventured to look back; but a voice called to her to ſtop, and ſhe heard ſteps advancing quick in purſuit. Before ſhe could reach the tower, her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The man came up, and gazing at her with a ſtrong expreſſion of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and curioſity, he aſſumed a gentle manner, aſſured her ſhe had nothing to fear, and inquired if ſhe belonged to La

Motte: obſerving that ſhe ſtill looked terrified and remained ſilent, he repeated his aſſurances and his queſtion.</p>
                     <p>"I know that he is concealed within the ruin," ſaid the ſtranger; "the occaſion of his concealment I alſo know; but it is of the utmoſt importance I ſhould ſee him, and he will then be convinced he has nothing to fear from me." Adeline trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſo exceſſively, that it was with difficulty ſhe could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port herſelf—ſhe heſitated, and knew not what to reply. Her manner ſeemed to confirm the ſuſpicions of the ſtranger, and her conſciouſneſs of this, increaſed her embaraſſment: he took advantage of it to preſs her farther. Adeline, at length replied that "La Motte had ſome time ſince reſided at the abbey." "And does ſtill Madam," ſaid the ſtranger; "lead me to where he may be found—I muſt ſee him, and"—</p>
                     <p>"Never, Sir," replied Adeline, "and I ſolemnly aſſure you it will be in vain to ſearch for him."</p>
                     <p>"That I muſt try," reſumed he, "ſince you, Madam, will not aſſiſt me. I have already followed him to ſome chambers above, where I ſuddenly loſt him: thereabouts he muſt be concealed, and it's plain therefore, they afford ſome ſecret paſſage."</p>
                     <p>Without waiting Adeline's reply, he ſprung to the door of the tower. She now thought it would betray a conſciouſneſs of the truth of his conjecture to follow him, and reſolved to remain below. But upon farther conſideration, it occurred to her, that he might ſteal ſilently into the cloſet, and poſſibly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe La Motte at the door of the trap. She, therefore, haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened after him, that her voice might prevent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhe apprehended. He was already in the ſecond cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, when ſhe overtook him, ſhe immediately began to ſpeak aloud.</p>
                     <p>This room he ſearched with the moſt ſcrupulous care, but finding no private door, or other outlet, he proceeded to the cloſet; then it was that it required all her fortitude to conceal her agitation.

that La Motte himſelf had not perceived by the eye, but by the trembling of the floor beneath his feet. Here is ſome myſtery," ſaid the ſtranger, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend and perhaps never ſhall." He was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to quit the cloſet when, who can paint the diſtreſs of Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, upon ſeeing the trap-door gently raiſed, and La Motte himſelf appeared. "Hah!" cried the ſtranger, advancing ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly to him. La Motte ſprang forward, and they were locked in each other's arms.</p>
                     <p>The aſtoniſhment of Adeline for a moment, ſurpaſſed even her former diſtreſs; but a remembrance darted acroſs her mind, which explained the preſent ſcene, and before La Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te could exclaim "My ſon!" ſhe new the ſtranger as ſuch. Peter who ſtood at the foot of the ſtairs and heard what paſſed above, flew to acquaint his miſtreſs with the joyful diſcovery, and, in a few moments ſhe was folded in the embrace of her ſon. This ſpot ſo lately the manſion of deſpair, ſeemed meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſed into the palace of pleaſure, and the walls echoed only to the accents of joy and congratulation.</p>
                     <p>The joy of Peter on this occaſion was beyond expreſſion: he acted a perfect pantomime—he capered about, claſped his hands—ran to his young maſter—ſhook him by the hand, in ſpite of the frowns of La Motte! ran every where without knowing for what, and gave no rational anſwer to any thing that was ſaid to him.</p>
                     <p>After their firſt emotions were ſubſided, La Motte, as if ſuddenly recollecting himſelf reſumed his wonted ſolemnity: "I am to blame," ſaid he, "thus to give way to joy, when I am ſtill, perhaps ſurrounded by danger. Let us ſecure a retreat while it is yet in our power," continued he, "in a few hours the King's officers may ſearch for me again."</p>
                     <p>Louis comprehended his father's words, and immediately relieved his apprehenſions by the following relation:</p>
                     <p>"A letter from Monſieur Nemours, containing an account of your flight from Paris, reached me at Peronne, where I was then upon duty with my regiment. He mentioned that you was gone towards the ſouth of France, but as he had not ſince heard from you, he was ignorant of the place of your refuge. It was about this time that I was diſpatched into Flanders; and, being unable to obtain farther intelligence of you, I paſſed ſome weeks of very painful ſolicitude. At the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="64" facs="unknown:029379_0033_0FE08A3657DA2BB0"/>
ſet out for Paris, hoping to learn from Nemours, where you had found an aſylum.</p>
                     <p>"Of this, however, he was equally<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ignorant with myſelf. He informed me that you had once before written to him from D—, upon your ſecond day's journey from Paris, under an aſſumed name, as had been agreed upon; and that you then ſaid the fear of diſcovery would prevent your haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arding another letter. He, therefore, remained ignorant of your abode, but ſaid he had no doubt you had continued your journey to the ſouthward. Upon this ſlender information I quitted Paris in ſearch of you, and proceeded immediately to V—, where my inquiries, concerning your farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, were ſucceſsful as far as M—. There they told me you had ſtaid ſome time, on account of the illneſs of a young lady; a circumſtance which perplexed me much, as I could not imagine what young lady would accompany you. I proceeded, however, to L—; but thereall traces of you ſeemed to be loſt. As I ſat muſing at the window of the inn, I obſerved ſome ſcribbling on the glaſs, and the curioſity of idleneſs prompted me to read it. I thought I knew the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and the lines I read confirmed my conjecture, for I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered to have heard you often repeat them.</p>
                     <p>"Here I renewed my inquiries concerning your route, and at length I made the people of the inn recollect you, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced you as far as Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There I again loſt you, till upon my return from a fruitleſs inquiry in the neighbourhood, the landlord of the little inn where I lodged, told me he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he had heard news of you, and immediately recounted what had happened at a blackſmith's ſhop a few hours before.</p>
                     <p>"His deſcription of Peter was ſo exact, that I had not a doubt it was you, who inhabited the abbey; and, as I knew your neceſſity for concealment, Peter's denial did not ſhake my co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I continued ſeeking you till near the cloſe of day, and till the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> called on you repeatedly, believing that my voice might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of your miſtake. At length I retired to paſs the night at a cottage near the border of the foreſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="unknown:029379_0033_0FE08A3657DA2BB0"/>"I came early this morning to renew my inquiries, and hoped that, believing yourſelf ſafe, you would emerge from concealment. But how was I diſappointed to find the abbey ſilent and ſolitary as I had left it the preceding evening! I was returning once more from the great hall, when the voice of this young lady caught my ear, and effected the diſcovery I had ſo anxiouſly ſought.</p>
                     <p>This little narrative entirely diſſipated the late apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of La Motte, but he now dreaded that the inquiries of his ſon, and his own obvious deſire of concealment, might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a curioſity amongſt the people of Auboine, and lead to a diſcovery of his true circumſtances. However, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he determined to diſmiſs all painful thoughts, and, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to enjoy the comfort which the preſence of his ſon had brought him. The furniture was removed to a more hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable part of the abbey, and the cells were again abandoned to their own glooms.</p>
                     <p>The arrival of her ſon ſeemed to have animated Madame La Motte with new life, and all her afflictions were for the preſent, abſorbed in joy. She often gazed ſilently on him with a mother's fondneſs, and her partiality heightened every improvement which time had wrought in his perſon and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He was now in his twenty-third year; his perſon was manly and his air military; his manners were unaffected and graceful, rather than dignified; and though his features were irregular, they compoſed a countenance, which, having ſeen it once, you would ſeek it again.</p>
                     <p>She made eager inquiries after the friends ſhe had left at Paris, and learned, that within the few months of her abſence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſome had died and others had quitted the place. La Motte alſo learned, that a very ſtrenuous ſearch for him had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted at Paris; and though this intelligence was only what he had before expected, it ſhocked him ſo much, that he now declared it would be expedient to remove to a diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Louis did not ſcruple to ſay, that he thought he would be as ſafe at the abbey as at any other place; and repeated what Nemours had ſaid, that the King's officers had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to trace any part of his route from Paris.</p>
                     <p>"Beſides," reſumed Louis, "this abbey is protected by a ſupernatural power, and none of the country people dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it."</p>
                     <p>"Pleaſe you, my young maſter," ſaid Peter, who was wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the room, "we were frightened enough the firſt night we came here, and I, myſelf, God forgive me! thought the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029379_0034_0FE08A3C19C6E080"/>
place was inhabited by devils, but they were only owls, and ſuch like, after all."</p>
                     <p>"Your opinion was not aſked," ſaid La Motte, "learn to be ſilent."</p>
                     <p>Peter was abaſhed. When he had quitted the room, La Motte aſked his ſon with ſeeming careleſſneſs, what were the reports circulated by the country people? "O! Sir," replied Louis, "I cannot recollect half of them. I remember, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they ſaid, that many years ago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a perſon (but no body had ever ſeen him, ſo we may judge how far the report ought to be credited) a perſon was privately brought to this abbey, and confined in ſome part of it, and that there was ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to believe he came unfairly to his end."</p>
                     <p>La Motte ſighed. "They farther ſaid," continued Louis, "that the ſpectre of the deceaſed had ever ſince watched night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the ruins: and to make the ſtory more wonderful, for the marvellous is the delight of the vulgar, they added, that there was a certain part of the ruin, from whence no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that had dared to explore it, had ever returned. Thus people, who have few objects of real intereſt to engage their thoughts, conjure up for themſelves imaginary ones."</p>
                     <p>La Motte ſat amuſing. "And what were the reaſons," ſaid he, at length awaking from his reverie, "they pretended to aſſign, for believing the perſon confined here was murdered?"</p>
                     <p>"They did not uſe a term ſo poſitive as that," replied Louis.</p>
                     <p>"True," ſaid La Motte, recollecting himſelf, "they only ſaid he came unfairly to his end."</p>
                     <p>"That is a nice diſtinction," ſaid Adeline.</p>
                     <p>"Why I could not well comprehend what theſe reaſons were," reſumed Louis, "the people indeed ſay, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who was brought here, was never known to depart, but I do not find it certain that he ever arrived; that there w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſtrange privacy and myſtery obſerved while he was here, and that the abbey has never ſince been inhabited by its owner. There ſeems, however, to be nothing in all this that deſerves to be remembered." La Motte raiſed his head, as if to reply, when the entrance of Madame turned the diſcourſe upon a new ſubject, and it was not reſumed that day.</p>
                     <p>Peter was now diſpatched for proviſions, while La Mott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and Louis retired to conſider how far it was ſafe for them to continue at the abbey. La Motte notwithſtanding the aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances lately given him, could not but think that Peter's blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and his ſon's inquiries might lead to a diſcovery of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

reſidence. He revolved this in his mind for ſome time, but at length a thought ſtruck him, that the latter of theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances might conſiderably contribute to his ſecurity. "If you," ſaid he to Louis, "return to the inn at Auboine, from whence you were directed here, and without ſeeming to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend giving intelligence, <hi>do</hi> give the landlord an account of your having found the abbey uninhabited, and then add, that you had diſcovered the reſidence of the perſon you ſought in ſome diſtant town, it would ſuppreſs any reports that may at preſent exiſt, and prevent the belief of any in future. And if after all this you can truſt yourſelf for preſence of mind and command of countenance, ſo far as to deſcribe ſome dreadful apparition, I think theſe circumſtances, together with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Abbey, and the intricacies of the foreſt could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title me to conſider this place as my caſtle."</p>
                     <p>Louis agreed to all that his father had propoſed, and on the following day executed his commiſſion with ſuch ſucceſs, that the tranquillity of the abbey may be then ſaid to have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely reſtored.</p>
                     <p>Thus ended this adventure, the only one that had occurred to diſturb the family, during their reſidence in the foreſt. Adeline removed from the apprehenſion of thoſe evils, with which the late ſituation of La Motte had threatened her, and from the depreſſion which her intereſt in his occaſioned her, now experienced a more than uſual complacency of mind. She thought too that ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bſerved in Madame La Motte a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of her former kindneſs, and this circumſtance awakened all her gratitude, and imparted to her a pleaſure as lively as it was innocent. The ſatisfaction with which the preſence of her ſon inſpired Madame La Motte, Adeline miſtook for kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to herſelf, and ſhe exerted her whole attention in an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to become worthy of it.</p>
                     <p>But the joy which his unexpected arrival had given to La Motte quickly began to evaporate, and the gloom of deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency again ſettled on his countenance. He returned fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to his haunt in the foreſt—the ſame myſterious ſadneſs tinctured his manner and revived the anxiety of Madame La Motte, who was reſolved to acquaint her ſon with this ſubject of diſtreſs, and ſolicit his aſſiſtance to penetrate its ſource.</p>
                     <p>Her jealouſy of Adeline, however, ſhe could not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, though it again tormented her, and taught her to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrue with wonderful ingenuity every look and word of La Motte, and often to miſtake the artleſs expreſſions of Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line's
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029379_0035_0FE08A48C863FEB8"/>
gratitude and regard, for thoſe of warmer tenderneſs. Adeline had formerly accuſtomed herſelf to long walks in the foreſt, and the deſign Madame had formed of watching her ſteps, had been fruſtrated by the late circumſtances, and was now entirely overcome by a ſenſe of its difficulty and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. To employ Peter in the affair, would be to acquaint him with her fears, and to follow her herſelf, would moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably betray her ſcheme, by making Adeline aware of her jealouſy. Being thus reſtrained by pride and delicacy, ſhe was obliged to endure the pangs of uncertainty concerning the greateſt part of her ſuſpicions.</p>
                     <p>To Louis, however, ſhe related the myſterious change in his father's temper. He liſtened to her account with very earneſt attention, and the ſurpriſe and concern impreſſed upon his countenance ſpoke how much his heart was intereſted. He was however involved in equal perplexity with herſelf upon this ſubject, and readily undertook to obſerve the motions of La Motte, believing his interference likely to be of equal ſervice both to his father and his mother. He ſaw in ſome degree, the ſuſpicions of his mother, but as he thought ſhe wiſhed to diſguiſe her feelings, he ſuffered her to believe that ſhe ſucceeded.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029379_0035_0FE08A48C863FEB8"/>
increaſed his pity for her deſtitute condition, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, with which ſhe affected to judge the father, heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his honeſt indignation at his character.</p>
                     <p>As he quitted Madame La Motte, he ſaw his father croſs the lawn and enter the deep ſhade of the foreſt on the left. He judged this to be a good opportunity of commencing his plan, and, quitting the abbey, ſlowly followed at a diſtance. La Motte continued to walk ſtraight forward, and ſeemed ſo deeply wrapt in thought, that he looked neither to the right or left, and ſcarcely lifted his head from the ground. Louis had followed him near half a mile, when he ſaw him ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrike into an avenue of the foreſt, which took a different direction from the way he had hitherto gone. He quickened his ſteps that he might not loſe ſight of him, but, having reachd the avenue, found the trees ſo thickly interwoven, that La Motte was already hid from his view.</p>
                     <p>He continued, however, to purſue the way before him: it conducted him through the moſt gloomy part of the foreſt he had yet ſeen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till at length it terminated in an obſcure receſs, overarched with high trees, whoſe interwoven branches ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the direct rays of the ſun, and admitted only a ſort of ſolemn twilight. Louis looked around in ſearch of La Motte, but he was no where to be ſeen. While he ſtood ſurveying the place, and conſidering what farther ſhould be done, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, through the gloom, an object at ſome diſtance, but the deep ſhadow that fell around prevented his diſtinguiſhing what it was.</p>
                     <p>In advancing, he perceived the ruins of a ſmall building, which, from the traces that remained, appeared to have been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>omb. As he gazed upon it, "Here," ſaid he, "are prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably depoſited the aſhes of ſome ancient monk, once an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the abbey; perhaps, of the founder, who after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent a life of abſtinence and prayer, ſought in heaven the reward of his forbearance upon earth. Peace be to his ſoul! but did he think a life of mere negative virtue deſerved an eternal reward?

                     <p>He remained with his eyes fixed upon the ſpot, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſaw a figure ariſe under the arch of the ſepulchre. It ſtarted, as if on perceiving him, and immediately diſappeared.
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029379_0036_0FE08A4EF89BBEB8"/>
Louis, though unuſed to fear, felt at that moment an uneaſy ſenſation, but almoſt it immediately ſtruck him that this was La Motte himſelf. He advanced to the ruin and called him. No anſwer was returned, and he repeated the call, but all was yet ſtill as the grave. He then went up to the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and endeavoured to examine the place where he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, but the ſhadowy obſcurity rendered the attempt fruitleſs. He obſerved, however, a little to the right, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to the ruin, and advanced ſome ſteps down a dark kind of paſſage, when recollecting that this place might be the haunt of banditti, his danger alarmed him, and he retreated with precipitation.</p>
                     <p>He walked toward the abbey by the way he came, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no perſon followed him, and believing himſelf again in ſafety, his former ſurmiſe returned, and he thought it was La Motte he had ſeen. He muſed upon this ſtrange poſſibility, and endeavoured to aſſign a reaſon for ſo myſterious a conduct, but in vain. Notwithſtanding this, his belief of it ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he entered the abbey under as full a conviction as the circumſtances would admit of, that it was his father who had appeared in the ſepulchre. On entering what was now uſed as a parlour, he was much ſurpriſed to find him quietly ſeated there with Madame La Motte and Adeline, and converſing as if he had been returned for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>He took the firſt opportunity of acquainting his mother with his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>te adventure, and of inquiring how long La Motte had been returned before him, when learning that it was near half an hour, his ſurpriſe increaſed, and he knew not what to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, a perception of the growing partiality of Louis co-operated with the canker of ſuſpicion, to deſtroy in Madame La Motte that affection which pity and eſteem had formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited for Adeline. Her unkindneſs was now too obvious to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the notice of her to whom it was directed, and being noticed, it occaſioned an anguiſh which Adeline found it very difficult to endure. With the warmth and candor of youth, the ſought an explanation of this change of behaviour, and an apportunity of exculpating herſelf from any intention of provoking it. But this Madame La Motte artfully evaded, while at the ſame time ſhe threw out hints, that involved Adeline in deeper per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and ſerved to make her preſent affliction more intolerable.</p>
                     <p>"I have loſt that affection," ſhe would ſay, "which was my all. It was my only comfort—yet I have loſt it—and this

without even knowing my offence. But I am thankful I have not merited unkindneſs, and, though <hi>ſhe</hi> has abandoned <hi>me,</hi> I ſhall always love <hi>her.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>Thus diſtreſſed, ſhe would frequently leave the parlour, and retiring to her chamber, would yield to a deſpondency, which ſhe had never known till now.</p>
                     <p>One morning, being unable to ſleep, ſhe aroſe at a very early hour. The faint light of day now trembled through the clouds, and gradually ſpreading from the horizon, announced the riſing ſun. Every feature of the landſcape was ſlowly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled, moiſt wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The beauty of the hour invited her to walk, and ſhe went forth into the foreſt to taſte the ſweets of morning. The carols of new-waked birds ſaluted her as ſhe paſſed, and the freſh gale came ſcented with the breath of flowers, whoſe tints glowed more vivid through the dew drops that hung on their leaves.</p>
                     <p>She wandered on without noticing the diſtance, and following the windings of the river, came to a dewey glade, whoſe woods, ſweeping down to the very edge of the water, formed a ſcene ſo ſweetly romantic, that ſhe ſeated herſelf at the foot of a tree, to contemplate its beauty. Theſe images inſenſibly ſoothed her ſorrow, and inſpired her with that ſoft and pleaſing melancholy, ſo dear to the feeling mind. For ſome time ſhe ſat loſt in a reverie, while the flowers that grew on the banks beſide her, ſeemed to ſmile in new life, and drew from her a compariſon with her own condition. She muſed and ſighed, and then in a voice, whoſe charming melody was modulated by the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her heart, ſhe ſang the following words.</p>

Adeline watched the countenance of Madame with anxiety; and when there appeared in it a gleam of kindneſs, it was as ſunſhine to her ſoul: but ſhe very ſeldom ſuffered Adeline thus to flatter herſelf. Her converſation was reſtrained, and often pointed at ſomething more than could be underſtood. The entrance of Louis was a very ſeaſonable relief to Adeline, who almoſt feared to truſt her voice with a ſentence, leſt its trembling accents ſhould betray her uneaſineſs.</p>
                     <p>"This charming morning drew you early from your cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber," ſaid Louis, addreſſing Adeline. "You had, no doubt, a pleaſant companion too," ſaid Madame La Motte, "a ſolitary walk is ſeldom agreeable."</p>
                     <p>"I was alone, Madame," replied, Adeline.</p>
                     <p>"Indeed your own thoughts muſt be highly pleaſing then·"</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" returned Adeline, a tear, ſpite of her efforts, ſtarting to her eye, "there are now few ſubjects of pleaſure left for them."</p>
                     <p>"That is, very ſurpriſing," purſued Madame La Motte.</p>
                     <p>"Is it indeed, ſupriſing Madame, for thoſe who have loſt their laſt friend to be unhappy?"</p>
                     <p>Madame La Motte's conſcience acknowledged the rebuke, and ſhe bluſhed. "Well," reſumed ſhe, after a ſhort pauſe, "that is not your ſituation, Adeline;" looking earneſtly at La Motte. Adeline, whoſe innocence protected her from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, did not regard this circumſtance; but, ſmiling through her tears, ſaid, ſhe rejoiced to hear her ſay ſo. During this converſation, La Motte had remained abſorbed in his own thoughts; and Louis, unable to gueſs at what it pointed, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alternately at his Mother and Adeline for an explanation. The latter he regarded with an expreſſion ſo full of tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, that it revealed at once to Madame La Motte the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of his ſoul; and ſhe immediately replied to the laſt words of Adeline with a very ſerious air; "A friend is only eſtimable when our conduct de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:029379_0038_0FE08A616800F780"/>The manner and emphaſis with which ſhe delivered theſe words, again alarmed Adeline, who mildly ſaid, "ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould never deſerve ſuch cenſure." Madame was ſilent; but Adeline was ſo much ſhocked by what had already paſſed, that tears ſprung from her eyes, and ſhe hid her face with her handkerchief.</p>
                     <p>Louis now roſe with ſome emotion; and La Motte rouſed from his reverie, inquired what was the matter; but, before he could receive an anſwer, he ſeemed to have forgot that he had aſked the queſtion. "Adeline may give you her own account," ſaid Madame La Motte. "I have not deſerved this," ſaid Adeline, riſing, "but ſince my preſence is diſpleaſing, I will retire."</p>
                     <p>She moved towards the door, when Louis, who was pacing the room in apparent agitation gently took her hand, ſaying, "Here is ſome unhappy miſtake," and would have led her to the ſeat; but her ſpirits were too much depreſſed to endure longer reſtraint; and, withdrawing her hand, "Suffer me to go;" ſaid ſhe, "if there is any miſtake, I am unable to explain it." Saying this, ſhe quitted the room. Louis followed her with his eyes to the door; when, turning to his mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Surely, Madam," ſaid he, "you are to blame; my life o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"You are very eloquent in her cauſe, Sir," ſaid Madame, "may I preſume to aſk what has intereſted you thus in her favour?"</p>
                     <p>"Her own amiable manners," rejoi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"But you may preſume too much on your own obſervations, it is poſſible theſe amiable manners may deceive you."</p>
                     <p>"Your pardon, Madame; I may without preſumption affirm they cannot deceive me."</p>
                     <p>"You have, no doubt, good reaſons for this aſſertion, and I perceive, by your admiration of this artleſs <hi>innocent,</hi> ſhe has ſucceeded in her deſign of entrapping your heart."</p>
                     <p>"Without deſigning it, ſhe has won my admiration, which would not have been the caſe, had ſhe been capable of the conduct you mention."</p>

                     <p>Saying this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he abruptly quitted the room, and Louis imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following, Madame was left to her own unpleaſant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. Her ill humour proceeded from the uſual cauſe. She had heard of Adeline's walk; and La Motte having gone forth into the foreſt at an early hour, her imagination, heated by the broodings of jealouſy, ſuggeſted that they had appointed a meeting. This was confirmed to her by the entrance of Adeline, quickly followed by La Motte; and her perceptions thus jaundiced by paſſion, neither the preſence of her ſon nor her uſual attention to good manners, had been able to reſtrain her emotions. The behaviour of Adeline in the late ſcene, ſhe conſidered as a refined piece of art; and the indifference of La Motte as affected. So true it is, that

                        </q>
And ſo ingenious was ſhe "to twiſt the true cauſe the wrong way."</p>
                     <p>Adeline had retired to her chamber to we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>p. When her firſt agitations were ſubſided, ſhe took an ample view of her conduct; and, perceiving nothing of which ſhe could accuſe herſelf, ſhe became more ſatisfied deriving her beſt comfort from the integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of her intentions. In the moment of accuſation, innocence may ſometimes he oppreſſed with the puniſhment due only to guilt; but reflection diſſolves the illuſion of terror, and bring<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to the aching boſom, the conſolations or virtue.</p>
                     <p>When La Motte quitted the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oom, he had gone into the foreſt, which Louis obſerving, he followed and joined him, with an intention of touching upon the ſubject of his melancholy. "It is a fine morning, Sir," ſaid Louis, "if you will give me leave, I will walk with you." La Motte, though diſſatisfied, did not object; and after they had proceeded ſome way, he changed the courſe of his walk, ſtriking into a path, contrary to that which Louis had obſerved him take on the foregoing day.</p>
                     <p>Louis remarked that the avenue they had quitted was "more ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y, and therefore more pleaſant." La Motte not ſeeming to notice this remark, "It leads to a ſingular ſpot," continued he, "which I diſcovered yeſterday." La Motte raiſed his head; Louis proceeded to deſcribe the tomb, and the adventure he had met with: during this relation, La Motte regarded him with attention, while his own countenance ſuffered various changes
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:029379_0039_0FE08A6EF9911B38"/>
When he had concluded. "You are very daring," ſaid La Motte, "to examine that place, particularly when you ventured down the paſſage: I would adviſe you to be more cautious how you penetrate the depths of this foreſt. I, myſelf, have not ventured beyond a certain boundary; and am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, uninformed what inhabitants it may harbour. "Your account has alarmed me," continued he, "for if banditti are in the neighbourhood, I am not ſafe from their depredations: 'tis true, "I have but little to loſe, except my life."</p>
                     <p>"And the lives of your family," rejoined Louis—"Of courſe," ſaid La Motte.</p>
                     <p>"It would be well to have more certainty upon that head," rejoined Louis, "I am conſidering how we may obtain it."</p>
                     <p>"'Tis uſeleſs to conſider that," ſaid La Motte, "the inquiry itſelf brings danger with it; your life perhaps, would be paid for the indulgence of your curioſity; our only chance of ſafety is by endeavouring to remain undiſcovered. Let us move tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the abbey."</p>
                     <p>Louis knew not what to think, but ſaid no more upon the ſubject. La Motte ſoon after relapſed into a fit of muſing; and his ſon now took occaſion to lament that depreſſion of ſpirits, which he had lately obſerved in him. "Rather lament the cauſe of it," ſaid La Motte with a ſigh: "That I do, moſt ſincerely, whatever it may be. May I venture to inquire, Sir, what is this cauſe?</p>
                     <p>"Are, then, my misfortunes ſo little known to you," rejoined La Motte, as to make that queſtion neceſſary? "Am I not driven from my home, from my friends, and almoſt from my country? And ſhall it be aſked why I am afflicted?" Louis felt the juſtice of this reproof, and was a moment ſilent. "That you are afflicted, Sir, does not excite my ſurpriſe;" reſumed he, "it would indeed be ſtrange, were you not."</p>
                     <p>"What then does excite your ſurpriſe?"</p>
                     <p>"The air of cheerfulneſs you wore when I firſt came hither."</p>
                     <p>"You lately lamented that I was afflicted," ſaid La Motte, "and now ſeem not very well pleaſed that I was once cheerful. What is the meaning of this?"</p>
                     <p>"You much miſtake me," ſaid his ſon, "nothing could give me ſo much ſatisfaction as to ſee that cheerfulneſs renewed; the ſame cauſe of ſorrow exiſted at that time, yet you was then cheerful."</p>
                     <p>"That I was then cheerful," ſaid La Motte, "you might, without flattery, have attributed to yourſelf; your preſence
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:029379_0039_0FE08A6EF9911B38"/>
revived me, and I was relieved at the ſame time from a load of apprehenſions."</p>
                     <p>"Why, then, as the ſame cauſe exiſts, are you not ſtill cherful?"</p>
                     <p>"And why do you not recollect that it is your father you thus ſpeak to?"</p>
                     <p>"I do, Sir, and nothing but anxiety for my father, could have urged me thus far; it is with inexpreſſible concern I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you have ſome ſecret cauſe of uneaſineſs; reveal it, Sir, to thoſe who claim a ſhare in all your affliction, and ſuffer them, by participation, to ſoften its ſeverity." Louis looked up, and obſerved the countenance of his father, pale as death: his lips trembled while he ſpoke. "Your penetration, however, you may rely upon it, has in the preſent inſtance, deceived you, I have no ſubject of diſtreſs, but what you are already acquainted with, and I deſire this converſation may never be renewed."</p>
                     <p>"If it is your deſire, of courſe, I obey," ſaid Louis, "but, pardon me, Sir, if"—</p>
                     <p>"I will not pardon you, Sir," interrupted La Motte, "let the diſcourſe end here." Saying this he quickened his ſteps, and Louis not daring to purſue, walked quietly on till he reached the abbey.</p>
                     <p>Adeline paſſed the greateſt part of the day alone in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where having examined her conduct, ſhe endeavoured to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify her heart againſt the unmerited diſpleaſure of Madame La Motte. This was a taſk more difficult than that of ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. She loved her and had relied on her friendſhip, which, notwithſtanding the conduct of Madame, ſtill appeared valuable to her. It was true, ſhe had not deſerved to loſe it, but Madame was ſo averſe to explanation, that there was little probability of recovering it, however ill-founded might be the cauſe of her diſlike. At length, ſhe reaſoned, or rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, perſuaded herſelf into tolerable compoſure; for to reſign a real good with contentment, is leſs an effort of reaſon than of temper.</p>
                     <p>For many hours ſhe buſied herſelf upon a piece of work, which ſhe had undertaken for Madame La Motte; and this ſhe did, without the leaſt intention of conciliating her favour, but becauſe ſhe felt there was ſomething in thus repaying unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which was ſuitable to her own temper, her ſentiments, and her pride. Self-love <hi>may</hi> be the centre, round which the human affections move, for whatever motive conduces to ſelf-gratification may be reſolved into ſelf-love; yet ſome of theſe affections are in their nature ſo refined—that though we cannot
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029379_0040_0FE08A739367F8C8"/>
deny their origin, they almoſt deſerve the name of virtue. Of this ſpecies was that of Adeline.</p>
                     <p>In this employment and in reading Adeline, paſſed as much of the day as poſſible. From books, indeed, ſhe had conſtantly derived her chief information and amuſement: thoſe belonging to La Motte were few, but well choſen; and Adeline could find pleaſure in reading them more than once. When her mind was diſcompoſed by the behaviour of Madame La Motte, or by a retroſpection of her early misfortunes, a book was the opiate that lull'd it to repoſe. La Motte, had ſeveral of the beſt Engliſh poets, a language which Adeline had learned in the convent; their beauties, therefore, ſhe was capable of taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they often inſpired her with enthuſiaſtic delight.</p>
                     <p>At the decline of day, ſhe quitted her chamber to enjoy the ſweet evening hour, but ſtrayed no farther than an evenue near the abbey, which fronted the weſt. She read a little, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it impoſſible any longer to abſtract her attention from the ſcene around, ſhe cloſed the book, and yielded to the ſweet complacent melancholy which the hour inſpired. The air was ſtill, the ſun, ſinking below the diſtant hill, ſpread a purple glow over the landſcape, and touched the foreſt glades with ſofter light. A dewy freſhneſs was diffuſed upon the air. As the ſun deſcended, the duſk came ſilently on, and the ſcene aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a ſolemn grandeur. As ſhe muſed, ſhe recollected and repeated the following ſtanzas:

                     <p>On her return to the abbey ſhe was joined by Louis, who, after ſome converſation, ſaid, "I am much grieved by the ſcene to which I was witneſs this morning, and have longed for an opportunity of telling you ſo. My mother's behaviour is too myſterious to be accounted for, but it is not difficult to perceive ſhe labours under ſome miſtake. What I have to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is, that whenever I can be of ſervice to you, you will command me."</p>
                     <p>Adeline thanked him for his friendly offer, which ſhe felt more ſenſibly than ſhe choſe to expreſs. "I am unconſcious," ſaid ſhe, "of any offence that may have deſerved Madame La Motte's diſpleaſure, and am therefore, totally unable to account for it. I have repeatedly ſought an explanation, which ſhe has as anxiouſly avoided; it is better therefore, to preſs the ſubject no farther. At the ſame time Sir, ſuffer me to aſſure you, I have a juſt ſenſe of your goodneſs." Louis ſighed, and was ſilent. At length, "I wiſh you would permit me," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed he to ſpeak with my mother upon this ſubject. I am ſure I could convince her of her error."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:029379_0041_0FE08A80137ADCB8"/>"By no means," replied Adeline, "Madame La Motte's diſpleaſure has given me inexpreſſible concern; but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel her to an explanation would only increaſe this diſpleaſure, inſtead of removing it. Let me beg of you not to attempt it."</p>
                     <p>"I ſubmit to your judgment," ſaid Louis, "but, for once, it is with reluctance. I ſhould eſteem myſelf moſt happy, if I could be of ſervice to you." He ſpoke this with an accent ſo tender, that Adeline, for the firſt time, perceived the ſentiments of his heart. A mind more fraught with vanity than her's would have taught her long ago to regard the attentions of Louis, as the reſult of ſomething more than well bred gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. She did not appear to notice his laſt words, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>NEAR a month elapſed without any remarkable occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: the melancholy of La Motte ſuffered little abatement; and the behaviour of Madame to Adeline, though ſomewhat ſoftened, was ſtill far from kind. Louis, by numberleſs little attentions, teſtified his growing affection for Adeline who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to treat them as paſſing civilities.</p>
                     <p>It happened, one ſtormy night, as they were preparing for reſt, that they were alarmed by a trampling of horſes near the abbey. The ſound of ſeveral voices ſucceeded, and a loud knocking at the great gate of the hall ſoon after confirmed the alarm. La Motte had little doubt that the officers of juſtice had at length diſcovered his retreat, and the perturbation of fear almoſt confounded his ſenſes; he, however ordered the lights to be extinguiſhed, and a profound ſilence to be obſerved, unwillin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to neglect even the ſlighteſt poſſibility of ſecurity. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> was a chance, he thought, that the perſons might ſuppoſe the place uninhabited, and believe they had miſtaken the object of their ſearch. His orders were ſcarcely obeyed when the knocking was renewed, and with increaſed violence.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029379_0041_0FE08A80137ADCB8"/>
Motte now repaired to a ſmall grated window in the portal of the gate, that he might obſerve the number and appearance of the ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>The darkneſs of the night baffled his purpoſe; he could on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive a groupe of men on horſeback; but, liſtening at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively, he diſtinguiſhed a part of their diſcourſe. Several of the men contended, that they had miſtaken the place; till a perſon, who from h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> authoritative voice appeared to be their leader, affirmed, that the lights had iſſued from this ſpot, and he was poſitive there were perſons within. Having ſaid this, he again knocked loudly at the gate, and was anſwered only by hollow echoes. La Motte's heart trembled at the ſound, and he was unable to move.</p>
                     <p>After waiting ſome time, the ſtrangers ſeemed as if in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, but their diſcourſe was conducted in ſuch a low tone of voice, that La Motte was unable to diſtinguiſh its purport. They withdrew from the gate, as if to depart, but he preſently thought he heard them amongſt the trees on the other ſide of the fabric, and ſoon became convinced they had not left the abbey. A few minutes held La Motte in a ſtate of torturing ſuſpence; he quitted the grate, where Louis now ſtationed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for that part of the edifice which overlooked the ſpot where he ſuppoſed them to be waiting.</p>
                     <p>The ſtorm was now loud, and the hollow blaſts, which ruſhed among the trees, prevented his diſtinguiſhing any other ſound. Once in the pauſes of the wind, he thought he heard diſtinct voices; but he was not long left to conjecture, for the renewed knocking at the gate again appalled him; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the terrors of Madame La Motte and Adeline, ſhe ran to try his laſt chance of concealment, by means of the trap-door.</p>
                     <p>Soon after, the violence of the aſſailants ſeemed to increaſe with every guſt of the tempeſt, the gate which was old and decayed, burſt from its hinges, and admitted them to the hall. At the moment of their entrance, a ſcream from Madame La Motte, who ſtood at the door of an adjoining apart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the ſuſpicions of the principal ſtranger, who continued to advance as faſt as the darkneſs would permit him.</p>
                     <p>Adeline had fainted, and Madame La Motte was calling loudly for aſſiſtance, when Peter entered with lights, and diſcovered the hall filled with men, and his young miſtreſs ſenſeleſs upon the floor. A chevalier now advanced, and ſoliciting pardon of Madame for the rudeneſs of his conduct, was attempting an
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029379_0042_0FE08A84A7DF5DF0"/>
apology, when perceiving Adeline, he haſtened to raiſe her from the ground, but Louis, who now returned, caught her in his arms, and deſired the ſtranger not to interfere.</p>
                     <p>The perſon to whom he ſpoke this, wore the ſtar of one of the firſt orders in France, and had an air of dignity, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him to be of ſuperior rank. He appeared to be about forty, but perhaps, the ſpirit and fire of his countenance made the impreſſion of time upon his features leſs perceptible. His ſoftened aſpect and inſinuating manners, while regardleſs of himſelf he ſeemed attentive only to the condition of Adeline, gradually diſſipated the apprehenſions of Madame La Motte, and ſubdued the ſudden reſentment of Louis. Upon Adeline, who was yet inſenſible, he gazed with an eager admiration, which ſeemed to abſorb all the faculties of his mind. She was, indeed, an object not to be contemplated with indifference.</p>
                     <p>Her beauty, touched with the languid delicacy of illneſs, gained from ſentiment what it loſt in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A light which gleamed through the trees, attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me hither, and, ſuch was the darkneſs without, that I did not know it proceeded from the abbey till I came to the door." The noble deportment of the ſtrangers, the ſplendour of their apparel, and above all, this ſpeech diſſipated every remaining doubt of Madame's, and ſhe was giving orders for refreſhments to be ſet before them, when La Motte, who had liſtened, and was now convinced he had nothing to fear, entered the apartment.</p>
                     <p>He advanced towards the Marquis with a complacent air, but as he would have ſpoke, the words of welcome faltered on his lips, his limbs trembled, and a ghaſtly paleneſs overſpread his countenance. The Marquis was little leſs agitated, and, in the firſt moment of ſurpriſe, put his hand upon his ſword, but, recollecting himſelf, he withdrew it, and endeavoured to obtain a command of features. A pauſe of agonizing ſilence enſued. La Motte made ſome motion towards the door, but his agitated frame refuſed to ſupport him, and he ſunk into a chair, ſilent and exhauſted. The horror of his countenance, together with his whole behaviour, excited the utmoſt ſurpriſe in Madame, whoſe eyes inquired of the Marquis more than he thought proper to anſwer: his looks increaſed, inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the myſtery, and expreſſed a mixture of emotions, which ſhe could not analyſe. Meanwhile, ſhe endeavoured to ſoothe and revive her huſband, but he repreſſed her efforts, and averting his face, covered it with his hands.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis, ſeeming to recover his preſence of mind, ſtepped to the door of the hall where his people were aſſembled, when La Motte, ſtarting from his ſeat, with a frantic air, called on him to return. The Marquis looked back and ſtopped, but ſtill heſitating whether to proceed; the ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Adeline, who was now returned, added to thoſe of La Motte, determined him, and he ſat down.

I entreat — I ſupplicate of you a few moments private diſcourſe." As he pronounced theſe words, tears ſwelled into his eyes, and the Marquis, ſoftened by his diſtreſs, conſented, though with evident emotion and reluctance, to his requeſt.</p>
                     <p>La Motte took a light and led the Marquis to a ſmall room in a remote part of the edifice, where they remained near an hour. Madame, alarmed by the length of their abſence, went in queſt of them: as ſhe drew near, a curioſity, in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, perhaps not unjuſtifiable, prompted her to liſten. La Motte juſt then exclaimed—"The phrenzy of deſpair!"— ſome words followed, delivered in a low tone, which ſhe could not underſtand—"I have ſuffered more than I can expreſs," continued he; "the ſame image has purſued me in my mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night dream, and in my daily wanderings. There is no pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, ſhort of death, which I would not have endured, to regain the ſtate of mind, with which I entered this foreſt.

                     <p>A loud guſt of wind, that burſt along the paſſage where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame La Motte ſtood, overpowered his voice and that of the Marquis, who ſpoke in reply: but ſhe ſoon after diſtinguiſhed theſe words, —"To-morrow, my Lord, if you return to theſe ruins, I will lead you to the ſpot."</p>
                     <p>"That is ſcarcely neceſſary, and may be dangerous," ſaid the Marquis. "From you my Lord, I can excuſe theſe doubts." reſumed La Motte; "but I will ſwear whateve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

with haſty ſteps, and ſometimes loſt in reverie. Meanwhile, the Marquis, ſeating himſelf by Adeline, directed to her his whole attention, except when ſudden fits of abſence came over his mind, and ſuſpended him in ſilence: at theſe times the young Chevalier addreſſed Adeline, who, with diffidence and ſome agitation, ſhrunk from the obſervance of both.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis had been near two hours at the abbey, and the tempeſt ſtill continuing, Madame La Motte offered him a bed. A look from her huſband made her tremble for the conſequence. Her offer was however, politely declined, the Marquis being evidently as impatient to be gone, as his tenant appeared diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his preſence, he often returned to the hall, and from the gates raiſed a look of impatience to the clouds. Nothing was to be ſeen through the darkneſs of night —nothing heard but the howlings of the ſtorm.</p>
                     <p>The morning dawned before he departed. As he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to leave the abbey, La Motte again drew him aſide, and held him for a few moments in cloſe converſation. His im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſioned geſtures, which Madame La Motte obſerved from a remote part of the room, added to her curioſity a degree of wild apprehenſion, derived from the obſcurity of the ſubject. Her endeavour to diſtinguiſh the correſponding words, was baffled by the low voice in which they were uttered.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis and his retinue at length departed, and La Motte, having himſelf faſtened the gates, ſilently and dejectedly withdrew to his chamber. The moment they were alone, Madame ſeized the opportunity of entreating her huſband to explain the ſcene ſhe had witneſſed. "Aſk me no queſtions," ſaid La Motte ſternly, "for I will anſwer none. I have already forbade you ſpeaking to me on this ſubject."</p>
                     <p>"What ſubject?" ſaid his wife. La Motte ſeemed to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect himſelf—"No matter—I was miſtaken—I thought you had repeated theſe queſtions before."</p>
                     <p>"Ah!" ſaid Madame La Motte, "it is then as I ſuſpected: your former melancholy, and the diſtreſs of this night, have the ſame cauſe."</p>
                     <p>"And why ſhould you either ſuſpect or inquire? am I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be perſecuted with conjectures?"</p>
                     <p>"Pardon me, I meant not to perſecute you; but my anxiety for your welfare will not ſuffer me to reſt under this dreadful uncertainty. Let me claim the privilege of a wife, and ſhare the affliction which oppreſſes you. Deny me not." La Motte interrupted her. Whatever may be the cauſe of the emotions
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029379_0044_0FE08A9907DD84F0"/>
which you have witneſſed, I ſwear that I will not reveal it. A time may come, when I ſhall no longer judge concealment neceſſary; till then be ſilent, and deſiſt from importunity; above all, forbear to remark to any one what you may have ſeen uncommon in me. Bury your ſurmiſe in your own boſom, as you would avoid my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urſe and my "deſtruction." The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined air with which he ſpoke this, while his countenance was overſpread with a livid hue, made his wife ſhudder; and ſhe forbore all reply.</p>
                     <p>Madame La Motte retired to bed, but not to reſt. She ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated on the paſt occurrence; and her ſurpriſe and curioſity, concerning the words and behavour of her huſband, were but more ſtrongly ſtimulated by reflection. One truth, however, appeared; ſhe could not doubt but the myſterious conduct of La Motte, which had for ſo many months oppreſſed her with anxiety, and the late ſcene with the Marquis, originated from the ſame cauſe. This belief which ſeemed to prove how unjuſtly ſhe had ſuſpected Adeline, brought with it a pang of ſelf accuſation. She looked forward to the morrow, which would lead the Marquis again to the abbey with impatience. Wearied nature at length reſumed her rights, and yielded a ſhort oblivion of care.</p>
                     <p>At a late hour, the next day, the family aſſembled to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. Each individual of the party appeared ſilent and abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but very different was the aſpect of their features, and ſtill more the complection of their thoughts. La Motte ſeemed agitated by impatient fear, yet the ſullenneſs of deſpair over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread his countenance. A certain wildneſs in his eyes at times expreſſed the ſudden ſtart of horror, and again his features would ſink into the gloom of deſpondency.</p>
                     <p>Madame La Motte ſeemed haraſſed with anxiety; ſhe watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every turn of her huſband's countenance, and impatiently waited the arrival of the Marquis. Louis was compoſed and thoughtful. Adeline ſeemed to feel her full ſhare of uneaſineſs. She had obſerved the behaviour of La Motte the preceding night with much ſurpriſe, and the happy confidence ſhe had hitherto repoſed in him was ſhaken. She feared alſo, leſt the exigency of his circumſtances ſhould precipitate him again i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>During breakfaſt, La Motte frequently roſe to the window from whence he caſt many an anxious look. His wife under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtood too well the cauſe of his impatience, and endeavoured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

repreſs her own. In theſe intervals, Louis attempted by whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to obtain ſome information from his father, but La Motte always returned to the table, where the preſence of Adeline pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented father diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>After breakfaſt, as he walked upon the lawn, Louis would have joined him, but La Motte preremptorily declared he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be alone, and ſoon after, the Marquis having not yet arrived, proceeded to a greater diſtance from the abbey.</p>
                     <p>Adeline retired into their uſual working room with Madame La Motte, who affected an air of cheerfulneſs, and even of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Feeling the neceſſity of offering ſome reaſon for the ſtriking agitation of La Motte, and of preventing the ſurpriſe which the unexpected appearance of the Marquis would occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Adeline, if ſhe was left to connect it with his behaviour of the preceding night, ſhe mentioned that the Marquis and La Motte had long been known to each other, and that this unexpected meeting, after an abſence of many years, and under circumſtances ſo altered and humiliating, on the part of the latter, had occaſioned him much painful emotion. This had been heightened by a conſciouſneſs that the Marquis had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly miſinterpreted ſome circumſtances in his conduct towards him, which had cauſed a ſuſpenſion of their intimacy.</p>
                     <p>This account did not bring conviction to the mind of Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, for it ſeemed inadequate to the degree of emotion, the Marquis and La Motte had mutually betrayed. Her ſurpriſe was excited and her curioſity awakened by the words which were mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Madame proceeding with her plan, ſaid, "The Marquis was now expected, and ſhe hoped whatever differences remained, would be perfectly adjuſted." Adeline bluſhed, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reply, her lips faltered. Conſcious of this agitation, and of the obſervance of Madame La Motte, her confuſion encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and her endeavours to ſuppreſs ſerved only to heighten it Still ſhe tried to renew the diſcourſe and ſtill ſhe found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to collect her thoughts. Shocked left Madame ſhould apprehend the ſentiment which had till this moment been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed almoſt from herſelf, her colour fled, ſhe fixed her eyes on the ground, and for ſome time found it difficult to reſpire. Madame La Motte inquired if ſhe was ill, when Adeline glad of the excuſe, withdrew to the indulgence of her own thoughts, which were now wholly engroſſed by the expectation of ſeeing again the young Chevalier, who had accompanied the Marquis.</p>

He entered the hall, followed by the young Chevalier, and accoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Madame with a ſort of ſtately politeneſs, inquired for La Motte, whom Louis now went to ſeek.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis remained for a few minutes ſilent, and then aſked of Madame La Motte "how her fair daughter did?" Madame underſtood it was Adeline he meant, and having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his inquiry, and ſlightly ſaid that ſhe was not related to them, Adeline, upon ſome indication of the Marquis's wiſh, was ſent for.

                     <p>La Motte now entered and apologized for his abſence, which the Marquis noticed only by a ſlight inclin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He was loſt in a chaos of conjecture concerning this affair, but curioſity and anxiety for his father induced him to follow at ſome diſtance.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the young ſtranger, whom the Marquis addreſſed by the name of Theodore, remained at the abbey with Madame La Motte and Adeline. The former with all her addreſs, could ſcarcely conceal her agitation during this interval. She moved involuntarily to the door, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe heard a footſtep, and ſeveral times ſhe went to the hall door, in order to look into the foreſt, but as often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, checked by diſappointment.

Theodore, by the impatient pleaſure which animated his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ſeemed frequently to anticipate the thought of Adeline</p>
                     <p>To them the abſence of the Marquis was ſhort, though long to Madame La Motte, whoſe countenance, brightened, when ſhe heard the trampling of horſes at the gate</p>
                     <p>The Marquis appeared but for a moment, and paſſed on with La Motte to a private room, where they remained for ſome time in conference, immediately after which he departed. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore took leave of Adeline, who, as well as La Motte and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, attended them to the gates, with an expreſſion of tender regret, and, often as he went looked back upon the abbey, till the intervening branches entirely excluded it from his view.</p>
                     <p>The tranſient glow of pleaſure diffuſed over the cheek of Adeline diſappeared with the young ſtranger, and ſhe ſighed as ſhe turned into the hall. The image of Theodore purſued her to her chamber; ſhe recollected with exactneſs every particular of his late converſation—his ſentiments ſo congenial with her own—his manners ſo engaging—his countenance ſo animated— ſo ingenious and ſo noble, in which manly dignity was blended with the ſweetneſs of benevolence—th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A ſigh that followed, told her more of her heart than ſhe wiſhed to know. She bluſhed, and ſighed again, and then ſuddenly recollecting, herſelf ſhe endeavoured to divert her thoughts to a different ſubject. La Motte's connection with the Marquis for ſome time engaged her attention, but, unable to develope the myſtery that attended it, ſhe ſought a refuge from her own reflections in the more pleaſing ones to be derived from books.</p>
                     <p>During this time, Louis, ſhocked and ſurpriſed at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme diſtreſs which his father had manifeſted upon the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Marquis, addreſſed him upon the ſubject. He had no doubt that the Marquis was intimately concerned in the event which made it neceſſary for La Motte to leave Paris, and he ſpoke his thoughts without diſguiſe, lamenting at the ſame time the unlucky chance, which had brought him to ſeek re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in a place of all others, the leaſt capable of affording it— the eſtate of his enemy. La Motte did not contradict this opinion of his ſon's, and joined in lamenting the evil fate which had conducted him thither.</p>

                     <p>"I have already anſwered you on this ſubject." ſaid La Motte, "and forbade you to renew it. I am now obliged to tell you, I care not how ſoon you depart, if I am to be ſubjected to theſe inquiries." La Motte walked abruptly away, and left his ſon to doubt and concern.</p>
                     <p>The arrival of the Marquis had diſſipated the jealous fears of Madame La Motte, and ſhe awoke to a ſenſe of her cruelty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Adeline, When ſhe conſidered her orphan ſtate—the uniform affection which had appeared in her behaviour—the mildneſs and patience with which ſhe had borne her injurious treatment, ſhe was ſhocked, and took an early opportunity of renewing her former kindneſs. But ſhe could not explain this ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eming inconſiſtency of conduct without betraying her late ſuſpicions, which ſhe now bluſhed to remember, nor could ſhe apologize for her former behaviour, without giving this expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>She contented herſelf, therefore, with expreſſing in her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the regard which was thus revived. Adeline was at firſt ſurpriſed, but ſhe felt too much pleaſure at the change to be ſcrupulous in inquiring its cauſe.</p>
                     <p>But, notwithſtanding the ſatisfaction which Adeline received from the revival of Madame La Motte's kindneſs, her thoughts frequently recurred to the peculiar and forlorn circumſtances of her condition. She could not help feeling leſs confidence than ſhe had formerly done in the friendſhip of Madame La Motte, whoſe character now appeared leſs amiable than her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had repreſented it, and ſeemed ſtrongly tinctured with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price. Her thoughts often dwelt upon the ſtrange introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Marquis at the abbey, and on the mutual emotions and apparent diſlike of La Motte and himſelf; and, under theſe circumſtances, it equally excited her ſurpriſe that La Motte ſhould chuſe, and that the Marquis ſhould permit him, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in his territory.</p>
                     <p>Her mind returned the oftner, perhaps to this ſubject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was connected with Theodore; but it returned uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the idea which attracted it.

                     <p>A FEW days after the occurrence related in the preceding chapter, as Adeline was alone in her chamber, ſhe was rouſed from a reverie by a trampling of horſes near the gate, and, on looking from the caſement, ſhe ſaw the Marquis de Montalt enter the abbey. This circumſtance ſurpriſed her, and an emotion, whoſe cauſe ſhe did not trouble herſelf to inquire for, made her inſtantly retreat from the window. The ſame cauſe however, led her thither again as haſtily, but the object of her ſearch did not appear, and ſhe was in no haſte to retire.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſtood muſing and diſappointed, the Marquis came out with La Motte, and immediately looking up, ſaw Adeline and bowed. She returned his compliment reſpectfully, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from the window, vexed at having been ſeen there. They went into the foreſt, but the Marquis's attendants did not, as before, follow them thither. When they returned, which was not till after a conſiderable time, the Marquis immediately mounted his horſe and rode away.</p>
                     <p>For the remainder of the day, La Motte appeared gloomy and ſilent, and was frequently loſt in thought. Adeline obſerved him with particular attention and concern; ſhe perceived that he was always more melancholy after an interview with the Marquis, and was now ſurpriſed to hear that the latter had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to dine the next day at the abbey.</p>
                     <p>When La Motte mentioned this, he added ſome high eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giums on the character of the Marquis, and particularly praiſed his generoſity and nobleneſs of ſoul. At this inſtant, Adeline recollected the anecdotes ſhe had formerly heard concerning the abbey, and they threw a ſhadow over the brightneſs of that excellence, which La Motte now celebrated. The account how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029379_0047_0FE08ABB86C951E8"/>
did not appear to deſerve much credit; a part of it, as far as a negative will admit of demonſtration, having been already proved falſe; for it had been reported, that the abbey was haunted, and no ſupernatural appearance had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver been obſerved by the preſent inhabitants.</p>
                     <p>Adeline, however, ventured to inquire, whether it was the preſent Marquis of whom thoſe injurious reports had been raiſed? La Motte anſwered her with a ſmile of ridicule; "Stories of ghoſts and hobgoblins have always been admired and cheriſhed by the vulgar," ſaid he. "I am inclined to rely upon my own experience, at leaſt as much as upon the accounts of theſe pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, if you have ſeen any thing to corroborate theſe accounts, pray inform me of it, that I may eſtabliſh my faith."</p>
                     <p>"You miſtake me, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "it was not concerning ſupernatural agency that I would inquire: I alluded to a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent part of the report, which hinted, that ſome perſon had been confined here, by order of the Marquis, who was ſaid to have died unfairly. "This was alleged as a reaſon for the Marquis's having abandoned the abbey."</p>
                     <p>"All the mere coinage of idleneſs," ſaid La Motte; "a romantic tale to excite wonder: to ſee the Marquis is alone ſufficient to refute this; and if we credit half the number of thoſe ſtories that ſpring from the ſame ſource, we prove our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves little ſuperior to the ſimpletons who invent them. Your good ſenſe, Adeline, I think, will teach you the merit of diſbelief."</p>
                     <p>Adeline bluſhed and was ſilent; but La Motte's defence of the Marquis appeared much warmer and more diffuſe than was conſiſtent with his own diſpoſition, or required by the occaſion. His former converſation with Louis occurred to her, and ſhe was the more ſurpriſed at what paſſed at preſent.</p>
                     <p>She looked forward to the morrow with a mixture of pain and pleaſure; the expectation of ſeeing again the young Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier occupying her thoughts, and agitating them with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous emotions: now ſhe feared his preſence, and now ſhe doubted whether he would come. At length ſhe obſerved this, and bluſhed to find how much he engaged her attention. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row arrived—the Marquis came—but he came alone; and the ſunſhine of Adeline's mind was clouded, though ſhe was able to wear her uſual air of cheerfulneſs. The Marquis was polite, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable, and attentive; to manners the moſt eaſy and elegant, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> added the laſt refinement of poliſhed life. His converſation was lively, amuſing, ſometimes even witty; and diſcovered great
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029379_0047_0FE08ABB86C951E8"/>
knowledge of the world; or, what is often miſtaken for it, an acquaintance with the higher circles, and with the topics of the day.</p>
                     <p>Here La Motte <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> alſo qualified to converſe with him, and they entered into a diſcuſſion of the characters and manners of the age with great ſpirit and ſome humour. Madame La Motte had not ſeen her huſband ſo cheerful ſince they left Paris, and ſometimes ſhe could almoſt fancy ſhe was there. Adeline liſtened, till the cheerfulneſs, which ſhe had firſt only aſſumed, became real. The addreſs of the Marquis was ſo inſinuating and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that her reſerve inſenſibly gave way before it, and her natural vivacity reſumed its long loſt empire.</p>
                     <p>At parting, the Marquis told La Motte he rejoiced at having found ſo agreeable a neighbour. La Motte bowed. I ſhall ſometimes viſit you," continued he, "and I lament that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at preſent invite Madame La Motte, and her fair friend, to my chateau, but it is undergoing ſome repairs, which make it but an uncomfortable reſidence."</p>
                     <p>The vivacity of La Motte diſappeared with his gueſt, and he ſoon relapſed into fits of ſilence and abſtraction. "The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis is a very agreeable man," ſaid Madame La Motte. "Very agreeable," replyed he. "And ſeems to have an excellent heart," ſhe reſumed. "An excellent one," ſaid La Motte.</p>
                     <p>"You ſeem diſcompoſed, my dear; what has diſturbed you?"</p>
                     <p>"Not in the leaſt—I was only thinking, that with ſuch agreeable talents, and ſuch an excellent heart, it was a pity the Marquis ſhould—</p>
                     <p>"What? my dear," ſaid Madame with impatience: "That the Marquis ſhould—ſhould ſuffer this abbey to fall into ruins," replied La Motte.</p>
                     <p>"Is that all!" ſaid Madame with diſappointment—"That is all, upon my honour," ſaid La Mottte, and left the room.</p>
                     <p>Adeline's ſpirits, no longer ſupported by the animated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Marquis, ſunk into langour, and when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, ſhe walked penſively into the foreſt. She followed a little romantic path that wound along the margin of the ſtream, and was overhung with deep ſhades. The tranquillity of the ſcene, which autumn now touched with her ſweeteſt tints, ſoftened her mind to a tender kind of melancholy, and ſhe ſuffered a tear, which, ſhe knew not wherefore, had ſtolen into her eye to tremble there unchecked. She came to a little lonely receſs, formed by high trees; the wind ſighed mournfully among the branches, and as it waved their lofty heads ſcattered their
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:029379_0048_0FE08AC1C25F5490"/>
leaves to the ground. She ſeated herſelf on a bank beneath, and indulged the melancholy reflection that preſſed on her mind.</p>
                     <p>"O! could I dive into futurity and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the events which await me!" ſaid ſhe; "I ſhould, perha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> by conſtant contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, be enabled to meet them with fortitude. An orphan in this wide world—thrown upon the friendſhip of ſtrangers for comfort, and upon their bounty for the very means of exiſtence, what but evil have I to expect! Alas, my father! how could you thus abandon your child—how leave her to the ſtorms of life—to ſink perhaps, beneath them? Alas, I have no friend!"</p>
                     <p>She was inturrupted by a ruſtling among the fallen leaves; ſhe turned her head, and perceiving the Marquis's young friend, aroſe to depart. "Pardon this intruſion," ſaid he, "your voice attracted me hither, and your words detained me; my offence, however, brings with it its own puniſhment, having learned your ſorrows—how can I help feeling them myſelf? would that my ſympathy, or my ſuffering, could reſcue you from them!" He heſitated—"Would that I could deſerve the title of your friend, and be thought worthy of it by yourſelf!"</p>
                     <p>The confuſion of Adeline's thoughts could ſcarcely permit her to reply; ſhe trembled and gently withdrew her hand, which he had taken while he ſpoke. "You have, perhaps heard, Sir, more than is true: I am, indeed, not happy, but a moment of dejection has made me unjuſt, and I am leſs unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate than I have repreſented. When I ſaid I had no friend, I was ungrateful to the kindneſs of Monſieur and Madame La Motte, who have been more than friends—have been as parents to me."</p>
                     <p>"If ſo, I honour them," cried Theodore with warmth; "and if I did not feel it to be preſumption, I would aſk why you are unhappy?—But"—He pauſed. Adeline, raiſing her eyes, ſaw him gazing upon her with intenſe and eager anxiety, and her looks were again fixed upon the ground. "I have pained you," ſaid Theodore, "by an improper requeſt. Can you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me, and alſo when I add, that it was an intereſt in your welfare, which urged my inquiry?"</p>
                     <p>"Forgiveneſs, Sir, it is unneceſſary to aſk. I am certainly obliged by the compaſſion you expreſs. But the evening is cold, if you pleaſe, we will walk towards the abbey." As they moved on, Theodore was for ſome time ſilent. At length, "It was but lately that I ſolicited your pardon," ſaid he, "and I ſhall now, perhaps, have need of it again; but you will do me the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:029379_0048_0FE08AC1C25F5490"/>
juſtice to believe, that I have a ſtrong, and, indeed, a preſſing reaſon to inquire how nearly you are related to Monſieur La Motte."</p>
                     <p>"We are not at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lated," ſaid Adeline; "but the ſervice he has done me I can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ver repay, and I hope my gratitude will teach me never to forget it."</p>
                     <p>"Indeed!" ſaid Theodore, ſurpriſed; "and may I aſk how long you have known him?"</p>
                     <p>"Rather, Sir, let me aſk why theſe queſtions are neceſſary?"</p>
                     <p>"You are juſt," ſaid he, with an air of ſelf condemnation, "my conduct has deſerved this reproof; I ſhould have been more explicit." He looked as if his mind was labouring with ſomething which he was unwilling to expreſs. "But you know not how delicately I am circumſtanced," continued he, "yet I will aver, that my queſtions are prompted by the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt intereſt in your happineſs—and even by my fears for your ſafety." Adeline ſtarted. "I fear you are deceived," ſaid he, "I fear there's danger near you."</p>
                     <p>Adeline ſtopped, and looking earneſtly at him, begged he would explain himſelf. She ſuſpected that ſome miſchief threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened La Motte; and Theodore continuing ſilent, ſhe repeated her requeſt. "If La Motte is concerned in this danger," ſaid ſhe, "let me entreat you to acquaint him with it immediately. He has but too many misfortunes to apprehend."</p>
                     <p>"Excellent Adeline!" cried Theodore, "that heart muſt be adamant that would injure you. How ſhall I hint what I fear is too true, and how forbear to warn you of your danger with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out"—He was interrupted by a ſtep among the trees, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after ſaw La Motte croſs into the path they were in. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eline felt confuſed at being thus ſeen with the Chevalier, and was haſtening to join La Motte, but Theodore detained her, and entreated a moment's attention. "There is now no time to explain myſelf," ſaid he; "yet what I would ſay is of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſequence to <hi>yourſelf.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"Promiſe, therefore, to meet me in ſome part of the foreſt at about this time to morrow evening, you will then, I hope, be convinced, that my conduct is directed, neither by common circumſtances, nor common regard." Adeline ſhuddered at the idea of making an appointment; ſhe heſitated, and at length entreated Theodore not to delay till to morrow an explanation which appeared to be ſo important, but to follow La Motte and inform him of his danger immediately. "It is not with La Motte I would ſpeak," replied Theodore; "I know of no
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:029379_0049_0FE08AD1143366E8"/>
danger that threatens him—but approaches, be quick, lovely Adeline, and promiſe to meet me."</p>
                     <p>"I do promiſe," ſaid Adeline, with a faltering voice; "I will come to the ſpot where you found me this evening, an hour earlier to morrow." Saying this, ſhe withdrew her trembling hand, which Theodore had preſſed to his lips in token of acknowledgment, and he immediately diſappeared.</p>
                     <p>La Motte now approached Adeline, who, fearing that he had ſeen Theodore, was in ſome confuſion, "Whither is Louis gone ſo faſt?" ſaid La Motte. She rejoiced to find his miſtake, and ſuffered him to remain in it. They walked penſively to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the abbey, where Adeline, too much occupied by her own thoughts to bear company, retired to her chamber. She ruminated upon the words of Theodore, and the more ſhe conſidered them, the more ſhe was perplexed. Sometimes ſhe blamed herſelf for having made an appointment, doubting whether he had not ſolicited it for the purpoſe of pleading a paſſion; and now delicacy checked this thought, and made her vexed that ſhe had preſumed upon having inſpired one. She recollected the ſerious earneſtneſs of his voice and manner, when he entreated her to meet him; and as they convinced her of the importance of the ſubject, ſhe ſhuddered at a danger, which ſhe could not comprehend, looking forward to the morrow with anxious impatience.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes too a remembrance of the tender intereſt he had expreſſed for her welfare, and of his correſpondent look and air, would ſteal acroſs her memory, awakening a pleaſing emotion and a latent hope that ſhe was not indifferent to him. From reflections like theſe ſhe was rouſed by a ſummons to ſupper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the repaſt was a melancholy one, it being the laſt evening of Louis's ſtay at the abbey. Adeline, who eſteemed him, regretted his departure, while his eyes were often bent on her with a look which ſeemed to expreſs that he was about to leave the object of his affection. She endeavoured by her cheerfulneſs ſo re-an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imate the whole party, and eſpecially Madame La Motte, who frequently ſhed tears. "We ſhall ſoon meet again," ſaid Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, "I truſt, in happier circumſtances." La Motte ſighed. The countenance of Louis brightened at her words, "Do you wiſh it,?" ſaid he, with peculiar emphaſis. "Moſt certainly I do," ſhe replied. "Can you doubt my regard for my beſt friends?"</p>
                     <p>"I cannot doubt any thing that is good for you," ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"You forget you have left Paris," ſaid La Motte to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> while a ſmile croſſed his face, "ſuch a compliment would the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"The language of admiration is not always that of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sir," ſaid Louis. Adeline, willing to change the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, aſked to what part of France he was going. He replied, that his regiment was now at Peronne, and he ſhould go im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately thither. After ſome mention of indifferent ſubjects, the family withdrew for the night to their ſeveral chambers.</p>
                     <p>The approaching departure of her ſon occupied the thoughts of Madame La Motte, and ſhe appeared at breakfaſt with eyes ſwoln with weeping. The pale countenance of Louis ſeemed to indicate that he had reſted no better than his mother. When breakfaſt was over, Adeline retired for a while, that ſhe might not interrupt, by her preſence, their laſt converſation. As ſhe walked on the lawn before the abbey ſhe returned in thought to the occurrence of yeſterday evening, and her impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience for the appointed interview increaſed. She was ſoon joined by Louis. "It was unkind of you to leave us," ſaid he, "in the laſt moments of my ſtay. Could I hope that you would ſometimes remember me, when I am far away, I ſhould depart with leſs ſorrow." He then expreſſed his concern at leaving her, and though he had hitherto armed himſelf with reſolution to forbear a direct avowal of an attachment, which muſt be fruitleſs, his heart now yielded to the force of paſſion, and he told what Adeline every moment feared to hear.</p>
                     <p>"This declaration," ſaid Adeline, endeavouring to overcome the agitation it excited, "gives me inexpreſſible concern."</p>
                     <p>"O, ſay not ſo!" interrupted Louis, "but give me ſome ſlender hope to ſupport me in the miſeries of abſence. Say that you do not hate me—Say"—</p>
                     <p>"That I do moſt readily ſay," replied Adeline, in a tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous voice; "if it will give you pleaſure to be aſſured of my eſteem and friendſhip—receive this aſſurance:—as the ſon of my beſt benefactors, you are entitled to."—</p>

I am above diſguiſe, and, therefore, aſſure you, that though your virtues will always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my eſteem, you have nothing to hope from my love. Were it even otherwiſe, our circumſtances would effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide for us. If you are really my friend, you will rejoice that I am ſpared this ſtruggle between affection and prudence. Let me hope alſo, that time will teach you to reduce love within the limits of friendſhip."</p>
                     <p>"Never!" cried Louis vehemently: "Were this poſſible, my paſſion would be unworthy of its object." While he ſpoke, Adeline's favourite fawn came bounding towards her. This circumſtance affected Louis even to tears. "This little animal." ſaid he, after a ſhort pauſe, "firſt conducted me to you: it was witneſs to that happy moment when I firſt ſaw you, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by attractions too powerful for my heart; that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is now freſh in my memory, and the creature comes even to witneſs this ſad one of my departure." Grief interrupted his utterance.</p>
                     <p>When he recovered his voice, he ſaid, "Adeline when you look upon your little favourite and careſs it, remember the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Louis, who will then be far—far from you. Do not deny me the poor conſolation of believing this!"</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall not require ſuch a monitor to remind me of you," ſaid Adeline, with a ſmile; "your excellent parents and your own merits have ſufficient claim upon my remembrance. Could I ſee your natural good ſenſe reſume its influence over paſſion, my ſatisfaction would equal my eſteem for you."</p>
                     <p>"Do not hope it," ſaid Louis, "nor will I wiſh it—for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion here is virtue." As he ſpoke he ſaw La Motte turn round an angle of the abbey. The moments are precious," ſaid he, "I am interrupted, O! Adeline, farewell! and ſay, that you will ſometimes think of me."</p>
                     <p>"Farewell," ſaid Adeline, who was affected by his diſtreſs; "farewell! and peace attend you. I will think of you with the affection of a ſiſter."—He ſighed deeply, and preſſed her hand; when La Motte, winding round another projection of the ruin, again appeared. Adeline left them together, and withdrew o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was ſomething of indelicacy and diſſimulation in an <hi>appointed</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, on her part, that ſhocked her. She recollected the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of Theodore's manner, and ſeveral little circumſtances which ſeemed to indicate that his heart was not unconcerned in the event. Again ſhe was inclined to doubt, whether he had not obtained her conſent to this meeting, upon ſome groundleſs ſuſpicion; and ſhe almoſt determined not to go: yet it was poſſible Theodore's aſſertion might be ſincere, and her danger re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l; the chance of this made her dedicate ſcruples appear ridiculous; ſhe wondered that ſhe had for a moment ſuffered them to weigh againſt ſo ſerious an intereſt, and blaming herſelf for the delay they had occaſioned, haſtened to the place of appointment.</p>
                     <p>The little path, which led to this ſpot, was ſilent and ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and when ſhe reached the receſs, Theodore had not arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A tranſient pride made her unwilling he ſhould find that ſhe was more punctual to his appointment than himſelf; and ſhe turned from the receſs into a track, which wound among the trees to the right. Having walked ſome way, without ſeeing any perſon, or hearing a footſtep, ſhe returned; but he was not come, and ſhe again left the place. A ſecond time ſhe came back, and Theodore was ſtill abſent. Recollecting the time at which ſhe had quitted the ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When theſe emotions ſubſided, and reaſon reſumed its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, ſhe bluſhed for what ſhe termed this childiſh efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of ſelf love. She recollected, as if for the firſt time, theſe words of Theodore: "I fear you are deceived, and that ſome danger is near you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Her judgment now acquitted the offender, and ſhe ſaw only the friend. The import of theſe words, whoſe truth ſhe no longer doubted, again alarmed her. Why did he trouble himſelf to come from the chateau, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to hint her danger, if he did not wiſh to preſerve her? And if he wiſhed to preſerve her, what but neceſſity could have withheld him from the appointment?</p>

That ſome evil hovered over her ſhe could not diſbelieve, but what it might be, ſhe was unable to gueſs. Monſieur and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame La Motte were her friends, and who elſe, removed, as ſhe now thought herſelf, beyond the reach of her father, could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure her? But why did Theodore ſay ſhe was deceived? She found it impoſſible to extricate herſelf from the labyrinth of conjecture, but endeavoured to command her anxiety till the following evening. In the mean time ſhe engaged herſelf in efforts to amuſe Madame La Motte, who required ſome relief, after the departure of her ſon.</p>
                     <p>Thus oppreſſed by her own cares and intereſted by thoſe of Madame La Motte, Adeline retired to reſt. She ſoon loſt her recollection, but it was only to fall into haraſſed ſlumbers, ſuch as but too often haunt the couch of the unhappy. At length her perturbed fancy ſuggeſted the following dream.</p>
                     <p>She thought ſhe was in a large old chamber belonging to the abbey, more ancient and deſolate, though in part furniſhed, than any ſhe had yet ſeen. It was ſtrongly barricadoed, yet no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appeared. While ſhe ſtood muſing and ſurveying the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe heard a low voice call her, and looking towards the place from whence it came, ſhe perceived by the dim light of a lamp, a figure ſtretched on a bed that lay on the floor. The voice called again, and approaching the bed, ſhe diſtinctly ſaw the features of a man who appeared to be dying. A ghaſtly paleneſs overſpread his countenance, yet there was an expreſſion of mildneſs and dignity in it, which ſtrongly intereſted her.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe looked on him, his features changed and ſeemed convulſed in the agonies of death. The ſpectacle ſhocked h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

apartment. At length, however, ſhe compoſed herſelf to ſleep; again ſhe fell into a dream.</p>
                     <p>She thought ſhe was bewildered in ſome winding paſſages of the abbey; that it was almoſt dark, and that ſhe wandered about a conſiderable time, without being able to find a door. Suddenly ſhe heard a bell toll from above, and ſoon after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of diſtant voices. She redoubled her efforts to extricate herſelf. Preſently all was ſtill, and, at length, wearied with the ſearch, ſhe ſat down on a ſtep that croſſed the paſſage. She had not been long here, when ſhe ſaw a light glimmer at a diſtance on the walls, but a turn in the paſſage, which was very long, prevented her ſeeing from what it proceeded. It continued to glimmer faintly for ſome time, and then grew ſtronger, when ſhe ſaw a man enter the paſſage, habited in a long black cloak, like thoſe uſually worn by attendants at funerals, and bearing a torch. He called to her to follow him, and led her through a long paſſage to the foot of a ſtaircaſe. Here ſhe feared to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and was running back, when the man ſuddenly turned to purſue her, and with the terror, which this occaſioned, ſhe awoke.</p>
                     <p>Shocked by thoſe viſions, and more ſo by their ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection, which now ſtruck her, ſhe endeavoured to continue awake, leſt their terrific images ſhould again haunt her mind: after ſome time, however, her haraſſed ſpirits again ſunk into ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber though not to repoſe.</p>
                     <p>She now thought herſelf in a large old gallery, and ſaw at one end of it a chamber door ſtanding a little open, and a light within: ſhe went towards it, and perceived the man ſhe had before ſeen, ſtanding at the door and beckoning her towards him. With the inconſiſtency ſo common in dreams, ſhe no longer endeavoured to avoid him, but advancing, followed him into a ſuite of very ancient apartments, hung with black, and lighted up as if for a funeral. Still he led her on, till ſhe found herſelf in the ſame chamber ſhe remembered to have ſeen in her former dream; a coffin, covered with a pall, ſtood at the farther end of the room: ſome lights, and ſeveral perſons ſurrounded it, who appeared to be in great diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly ſhe thought theſe perſons were all gone, and that ſhe was left alone; that ſhe went up to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and while ſhe gazed upon it, ſhe heard a voice ſpeak, as if from within, but ſaw no body. The man ſhe had before ſeen, ſoon after ſtood by the coffin, and lifting the pall, ſhe ſaw beneath it a dead perſon, whom ſhe thought to be the dying Chevalier ſhe had ſeen in her former dream: his features were ſunk in death,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:029379_0052_0FE08AE88C395560"/>
but they went yet ſerene. While ſhe looked at him, a ſtream of blood guſhed from his ſide, and deſcending to the floor, the whole chamber was overflowed; at the ſame time ſome words were uttered in the voice ſhe heard before; but the horror of the ſcene ſo entirely overcome her, that ſhe ſtarted and awoke.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe had recovered her recollection, ſhe raiſed herſelf in the bed, to be convinced it was a dream ſhe had witneſſed, and the agitation of her ſpirits was ſo great, that ſhe feared to be alone, and almoſt determined to call Annette. The features of the deceaſed perſon, and the chamber where he lay, were ſtrongly impreſſed upon her memory, and ſhe ſtill thought ſhe heard the voice and ſaw the countenance which her dream re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. The longer ſhe conſidered theſe dreams, the more ſhe was ſurpriſed: they were ſo very terrible, returned ſo often, and ſeemed to be ſo connected with each other, that ſhe could ſcarcely think them accidental; yet, why they ſhould be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, ſhe could not tell. She ſlept no more that night.</p>

of the abbey; and on going to the caſement, Adeline ſaw the Marquis and his attendants on the lawn below. The portal of the abbey concealed ſeveral people from her view, and among theſe it was poſſible might be Theodore, who had not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: ſhe continued to look for him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>A meſſage from La Motte, however, ſoon called her to join the party, where ſhe vainly hoped to find Theodore. The Marquis aroſe as ſhe approached, and, having paid her ſome general compliments, the converſation took a very lively turn. Adeline, finding it impoſſible to counterfeit cheerfulneſs, while her heart was ſinking with anxiety and diſappointment, took little part in it: Theodore was not once named. She would have aſked concerning him, had it been poſſible to inquire with propriety; but ſhe was obliged to content herſelf with hoping, firſt, that he would arrive before dinner, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the the departure of the Marquis.</p>
                     <p>Thus, the day paſſed in expectation and diſappointment. The evening was now approaching, and ſhe was condemned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the preſence of the Marquis, apparently liſtening to a converſation, which, in truth ſhe ſcarcely heard, while the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was, perhaps, eſcaping that would decide her fate. She was ſuddenly relieved from this ſtate of torture, and thrown into one, if poſſible, ſtill more diſtreſſing.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis inquired for Louis, and being informed of his departure, mentioned that Theodore Peyrou had that morning ſat out for his regiment in a diſtant province. He lamented the loſs he ſhould ſuſtain by his abſence; and expreſſed ſome very flattering praiſe of his, talents. The ſhock of this intelligence overpowered the long agitated ſpirits of Adeline; the blood forſook her cheeks, and a ſudden faintneſs came over her, from which ſhe recovered only to a conſciouſneſs of having diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered her emotion, and the danger of relapſing into a ſecond fit.</p>
                     <p>She retired to her chamber, where, being once more alone, her oppreſſed heart found relief from tears, in which ſhe freely indulged. Ideas crowded ſo faſt upon her mind, that it was long ere ſhe could arrange them ſo as to produce any thing like reaſoning. She endeavoured to account for the abrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Theodore.</p>
                     <p>"Is it poſſible" ſaid ſhe, "that he ſhould take an intereſt in my welfare, and yet leave me expoſed to the full force of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:029379_0053_0FE08AFB56E2D360"/>
which he himſelf foreſaw? Or am I to believe that he has trifled with my ſimplicity for an idle frolic, and has now left me to the wondering apprehenſion he has raiſed? Impoſſible! a countenance ſo noble, and a manner ſo amiable, could never diſguiſe a heart capable of forming ſo deſpicable a deſign. No!— whatever is reſerved for me, let me not relinquiſh the pleaſure of believing that he is worthy of my eſteem."</p>
                     <p>She was awakened from thoughts like theſe by a peal of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant thunder, and now perceived that the gloomineſs of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was deepened by the coming ſtorm; it rolled onward, and ſoon after the lightning began to flaſh along the chamber. Adeline was ſuperior to the affectation of fear, and was not apt to be terrified; but ſhe now felt it unpleaſant to be alone, and, hoping that the Marquis might have left the abbey, ſhe went down to the ſitting room; out the threatening aſpect of the Heavens had hitherto detained him, and now the evening tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt made him rejoice that he had not quitted a ſhelter. The ſtorm continued and night came on. La Motte preſſed his gueſt to take a bed at the abbey, and he at length conſented; a circumſtance which threw Madame La Motte into ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, as to the accommodation to be afforded him; after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, ſhe arranged the affair to her ſatisfaction; reſigning her own apartment to the Marquis, and that of Louis to two of his ſuperior attendants; Adeline, it was farther ſettled, ſhould give up her room to Monſieur and Madame La Motte, and remove to an inner chamber, where a ſmall bed, uſually occupied by Annette, was placed for her.</p>
                     <p>At ſupper the Marquis was leſs gay than uſual; he frequently addreſſed Adeline, and his look and manner ſeemed to expreſs the tendereſt intereſt, which her indiſpoſition, for ſhe ſtill appeared pale and languid, had excited. Adeline, as uſual, made an effort to forget her anxiety, and appear happy; but the veil of aſſumed cheerfulneſs was too thin to conceal the features of ſorrow; and her feeble ſmiles only added a peculiar ſoftneſs to her air. The Marquis converſed with her on a variety of ſubjects, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played an elegant mind. The obſervations of Adeline, which, when called upon, ſhe gave with reluctant modeſty, in words at once ſimple and forceful, ſeemed to exci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e his admiration, which he ſometimes betrayed by an inadvertent expreſſion.</p>
                     <p>Adeline retired early to her room, which adjoined on one ſide to Madame La Motte's, and on the other to the cloſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned. It was ſpacious and lofty, and what little furniture it contained was falling to decay; but, perhaps, the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:029379_0053_0FE08AFB56E2D360"/>
preſent tone of her ſpirits might contribute more than theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances to give that air of melancholy, which ſeemed to reign in it. She was unwilling to go to bed, left the dreams that had lately purſued her ſhould return; and determined to ſit up till ſhe found herſelf oppreſſed by ſleep, when it was prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able her reſt would be profound. She placed the light on a ſmall table, and taking a book, continued to read for above an hour, till her mind refuſed any longer to abſtract itſelf from its own cares, and ſhe ſat for ſometime leaning penſively on her arm.</p>
                     <p>The wind was high, and as it whiſtled through the deſolate apartment, and ſhook the feeble doors, ſhe often ſtarted, and ſometimes even thought ſhe heard ſighs between the pauſes of the guſt; but ſhe checked theſe illuſions, which the hour of the night and her own melancholy imagination conſpired to raiſe. As ſhe ſat muſing, her eyes fixed on the oppoſite wall, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the arras, with which the room hung, wave backward and forwards; ſhe continued to obſerve it for ſome minutes, and then roſe to examine it farther. It was moved by the wind; and ſhe bluſhed at the momentary fear it had excited: but ſhe obſerved that the tapeſtry was more ſtrongly agitated in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place than elſewhere, and a noiſe that ſeemed ſomething more than that of the wind iſſued thence. The old bedſtead which La Motte had found in this apartment, had been removed to accommodate Adeline, and it was behind the place where this had ſtood, that the wind ſeemed to ruſh with particular force; curioſity prompted her to examine ſtill farther; ſhe felt about the tapeſtry, and perceiving the wall behind ſhake under her hand, ſhe lifted the arras, and diſcovered a ſmall door, whoſe looſened hinges admitted the wind, and occaſioned the noiſe ſhe had heard.</p>
                     <p>The door was held only by a bolt, having undrawn which, and brought the light, ſhe deſcended by a few ſteps into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chamber: ſhe inſtantly remembered her dreams. The chamber was not much like that in which ſhe had ſeen the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chevalier and afterwards the bier; but it gave her a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed remembrance of one through which ſhe had paſſed. Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the light to examine it more fully, ſhe was convinced by its ſtructure that it was part of the ancient foundation. A ſhattered <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aſement, placed high from the floor, ſeemed to be the only opening to admit light. She obſerved a door on the oppoſite ſide of the apartment; and after ſome moments of heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, gained courage and determined to purſue the inquiry. "A myſtery ſeems to hang over theſe chambers," ſaid ſhe,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:029379_0054_0FE08B002C187F78"/>
"which it is, perhaps, my lot to devolope; I will, at leaſt, ſee to what that door leads."</p>
                     <p>She ſtepped forward, and having uncloſed it, proceeded with faltering ſteps along a ſuite of apartments, reſembling the firſt in ſtyle and condition, and terminating in one exactly that where her dream had repreſented the dying perſon; the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance ſtruck ſo forcibly upon her imagination, that ſhe was in danger of fainting; and looking round the room, almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to ſee the phantom of her dream.</p>
                     <p>Unable to quit the place, ſhe ſat down on ſome old lumber to recover herſelf, while her ſpirits were nearly overcome by a ſuperſtitious dread, ſuch as ſhe had never felt before. She wondered to what part of the abbey theſe chambers belonged, and that they had ſo long eſcaped detection. The caſements were all too high to afford any information from without. When ſhe was ſufficiently compoſed to conſider the direction of the rooms, and the ſituation of the abbey, there appeared not a doubt that they formed an interior part of the original building.</p>
                     <p>As theſe reflections paſſed over her mind, a ſudden gleam of moonlight fell upon ſome object without the caſement. Being now ſufficiently compoſed to wiſh to purſue the inquiry; and believing this object might afford her ſome means of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſituation of theſe rooms, ſhe combated her remaining terrors, and in order to diſtinguiſh it more clearly, removed the light to an outer chamber; but before ſhe could return, a heavy cloud was driven over the face of the moon, and all without was perfectly dark: ſhe ſtood for ſome moments wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a returning gleam, but the obſcurity continued. As ſhe went ſoftly back for the light, her foot ſtumbled over ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on the floor, and while ſhe ſtopped to examine it, the moon again ſhone, ſo that ſhe could diſtinguiſh through the caſement, the eaſtern towers of the abbey. This diſcovery confirmed her former conjectures concerning the interior ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe apartments. The obſcurity of the place prevented her diſcovering what it was that had impeded her ſteps, but having brought the light forward, ſhe perceived on the floor an old dagger: with a trembling hand ſhe took it up, and upon a cloſer view perceived, that it was ſpotted and ſtained with ruſt.</p>
                     <p>Shocked and ſurpriſed, ſhe looked round the room for ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

chair, with broken arms, that ſtood in one corner of the room, and a table in a condition equally ſhattered, except that in another part lay a confuſed heap of things, which appeared to be old lumber. She went up to it, and perceived a broken bedſtead, with ſome decayed remnants of furniture covered with duſt and cobwebs, and which ſeemed, indeed as if they had not been moved for many years. Deſirous, however, of examining farther, ſhe attempted to raiſe what appeared to have been part of the bedſtead, but it ſlipped from her hand, and, rooling to the floor, brought with it ſome of the remaining lumber. Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſtarted aſide and ſaved herſelf, and when the noiſe it made had ceaſed, ſhe heard a ſmall ruſtling ſound, and as ſhe was about to leave the chamber, ſaw ſomething falling gently among the lumber.</p>
                     <p>It was a ſmall roll of paper, tied with a ſtring and covered with duſt. Adeline took it up, and on opening it perceived a hand writing. She attemped to read it but the part of the manuſcript ſhe looked at was ſo much obliterated, that ſhe found this difficult, though what few words were legible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her with curioſity and terror, and induced her to return with it immediately to her chamber.</p>
                     <p>Having reached her own room, ſhe faſtened the private door, and let the arras fall over it as before. It was now midnight. The ſtillneſs of the hour, interrupted only at intervals by the hollow ſighings of the blaſt, heightened the ſolemnity of Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line's feelings. She wiſhed ſhe was not alone, and before ſhe proceeded to look into the manuſcript, liſtened whether Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame La Motte was yet in her chamber: not the leaſt ſound was heard, and ſhe gently opened the door. The profound ſilence within almoſt convinced her that no perſon was there; but willing to be farther ſatisfied ſhe brought the light and found the room empty. The lateneſs of the hour made her wonder that Madame La Motte was not in her chamber, and ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the top of the tower ſtairs, to hearken if any perſon was ſtirring.</p>
                     <p>She heard the ſound of voices from below, and amongſt the reſt that of La Motte ſpeaking in his uſual tone. Being now ſatisfied that all was well, ſhe turned towards her room, when ſhe heard the Marquis pronounce her name with very unuſual <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"I do," replied the Marquis, "and I will abide by it. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

know both what to hope and how to act." Adeline trembled ſo exceſſively, that ſhe could ſcarcely ſupport herſelf: ſhe wiſhed to return to her chamber; yet ſhe was too much intereſted in the words ſhe had heard, not to be anxious to have them more fully explained. There was an interval of ſilence, after which they converſed in a lower tone. Adeline rememberd the hints of Theodore, and determined, if poſſible, to be relieved from the terrible ſuſpenſe ſhe now ſuffered. She ſtole ſoftly down a few ſteps, that ſhe might catch the accents of the ſpeakers, but they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ere ſo low that ſhe could only now and then diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh a few words. "Her father, ſay you?" ſaid the Marquis, "Yes, my Lord, her father. I am well informed of what I ſay." Adeline ſhuddered at the mention of her father, a new terror ſeized her, and with increaſing eagerneſs ſhe endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſtinguiſh their words, but for ſome time found this to be impoſſible. "Here is no time to be loſt," ſaid the Marquis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "to morrow then."—She heard La Motte riſe, and, believing it was to leave the room, ſhe hurried up the ſteps, and having reached her chamber, ſunk almoſt lifeleſs in a chair.</p>
                     <p>It was her father only of whom ſhe thought. She doubted not that he had purſued and diſcovered her retreat, and though this conduct appeared very inconſiſtent with his former beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in abandoning her to ſtrangers, her fears ſuggeſted that it would terminate in ſome new cruelty. She did not heſitate to pronounce this the danger of which Theodore had warned her; but it was impoſſible to ſurmiſe how he had gained his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, or how he had become ſufficiently acquainted with her ſtory, except through La Motte, her apparent friend and protector, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Why indeed, ſhould La Motte conceal from her only his knowledge of her father's intention, unleſs he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deliver her into his hands?

ſwelled into her eyes, but ſhe endeavoured to check them, and with a look, in which grief and indignation ſeemed to ſtruggle for pre-eminence, ſhe ſaid, "My Lord, this is unworthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, let me paſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a moment, he was awed by the dignity of her manner, and he threw himſelf at her feet to implore forgiveneſs. But ſhe waved her hand in ſilence and hurried from the room. When ſhe reached her chamber, ſhe locked the door, and ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a chair, yielded to the ſorrow, that preſſed at her heart. And it was not the leaſt of her ſorrow, to ſuſpect that La Motte was unworthy of her confidence; for it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible that he could be ignorant of the real deſigns of the Marquis. Madame La Motte, ſhe believed was impoſed upon by a ſpecious pretence of honourable attachment; and thus was ſhe ſpared the pang, which a doubt of her integrity would have added.</p>
                     <p>She threw a trembling glance upon the proſpect around her. On one ſide was her father, whoſe cruelty had already been too plainly manifeſted; and on the other, the Marquis purſuing her with inſult, and vicious paſſion. She reſolved to acquaint Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame La Motte with the purport of the late converſation, and, in the hope of her protection and ſympathy, ſhe wiped away her tears, and was leaving the room juſt as Madame La Motte entered it. While Adeline related what had paſſed, her friend wept, and appeared to ſuffer great agitation. She endeavoured to comfort her, and promiſed to uſe her influence in perſuading La Motte to prohibit the addreſſes of the Marquis. "You know, my dear," added Madame, "that our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances oblige us to preſerve terms with the Marquis, and you will, therefore, ſuffer as little reſentment to appear in your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner towards him as poſſible; conduct yourſelf with your uſual caſe in his preſence, and I doubt not this affair will paſs over, without ſubjecting you to farther ſolicitation."</p>
                     <p>"Ah Madame!" ſaid Adeline, "how hard is this taſk you aſſign me! I entreat you that I may never more be ſubjected to the humiliation of being in his preſence, that, whenever he aſſits the abbey, I may be ſuffered to remain in my chamber."</p>
                     <p>"This, ſaid Madame La Motte, "I would moſt readily conſent to, would our ſituation permit it. But you well know our aſylum in this abbey depends upon the good will of the Marquis, which we muſt not wantonly loſe; and ſurely ſuch a conduct as you propoſe would endanger this. Let us uſe milder meaſures and we ſhall preſerve his friendſhip, without ſubjecting
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:029379_0058_0FE08B2D8CAD6068"/>
you to any ſerious evil. Appear with your uſual complacence: the taſk is not ſo difficult as you imagine."</p>
                     <p>Adeline ſighed. I obey you Madame," ſaid ſhe; "it is my duty to do ſo; but I may be pardoned for ſaying, it is with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme reluctance. Madame La Motte promiſed to go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to her huſband, and Adeline departed, though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of her ſafety, yet ſomewhat more at eaſe.</p>
                     <p>She ſoon after ſaw the Marquis depart, and, as there now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be no obſtacle to the return of Madame La Motte, ſhe expected her with extreme impatience. After thus waiting near an hour in her chamber, ſhe was at length ſummoned to the parlour, and there found Monſieur La Motte alone. He aroſe upon her entrance, and for ſome minutes paced the room in ſilence. He then ſeated himſelf, and addreſſed her: "What you have mentioned to Madame La Motte," ſaid he, "would give me much concern, did I conſider the behaviour of the Marquis in a light ſo ſerious as ſhe does. I know that young ladies are apt to miſconſtrue the unmeaning gallantry of faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable manners, and you, Adeline, can never be too cautious in diſtinguiſhing between a levity of this kind, and a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious adddreſs."</p>
                     <p>Adeline was ſurpriſed and offended that La Motte ſhould think ſo lightly both of her underſtanding and diſpoſition as his ſpeech impl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>. "It is impoſſible, Sir," ſaid ſhe, "that you have been apprized of the Marquis's conduct?"</p>
                     <p>"It is very poſſible, and very certain," replied La Motte, with ſome aſperity; "and very poſſible, alſo, that I may ſee this affair with a judgment leſs diſcoloured by prejudice than you do. But, however, I ſhall not diſpute this point. I ſhall only requeſt, that, ſince you are acquainted with the emergency of my circumſtances, you will conform to them, and not, by an ill timed reſentment, expoſe me to the enmity of the Marquis. He is now my friend, and it is neceſſary to my ſafety that he ſhould continue ſuch; but if I ſuffer any part of my family to treat him with rudeneſs I muſt expect to ſee him my enemy. You may ſurely treat him with complaiſance." Adeline thought the term <hi>rudeneſs</hi> a harſh one, as La Motte applied it, but ſhe forebore from any expreſſion of diſpleaſure. "I could have wiſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir," ſaid ſhe, "for the privilege of retiring whenever the Marquis appeared; but ſince you believe this conduct would affect your intereſt, I ought to ſubmit."</p>
                     <p>"This prudence and good will delight me," ſaid La Motte, "and ſince you wiſh to ſerve me, know that you cannot more
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:029379_0058_0FE08B2D8CAD6068"/>
effectually do it, than by treating the Marquis as a friend." The word <hi>friend,</hi> as it ſtood connected with the Marquis, ſounded diſſonantly to Adeline's ear; ſhe heſitated and looked at La Motte.

                     <p>"Your plan is reaſonable," ſaid La Motte, "had I money to execute it. As it is I muſt be contented to rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Your father may ere this have commenced theſe meaſures, and the effects of his vengeance may now be hanging over my head. My regard for you, Adeline, has expoſed me to this; had I reſigned you to his will, I ſhould have remained ſecure."</p>
                     <p>Adeline was ſo much affected by this inſtance of La Motte's kindneſs, which ſhe could not doubt, that ſhe was unable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her ſenſe of it.

                     <p>"Is it poſſible I can be leſs than ſincere?" replied Adeline, weeping at the idea of ingratitude. "Sentiments are eaſily pronounced," ſaid La Motte, "though they may have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the heart; I believe them to be ſincere ſo far only as they influence our actions."</p>

I know that what I now write cannot avail me, yet there is comfort in pouring forth my griefs; and I bleſs that man, leſs ſavage than his fellows, who has ſupplied me theſe means of recording them. Alas! he knows full well, that from this indulgence he has nothing to fear. My pen can call no friends to ſuccour me, nor reveal my danger ere it is too late.

"In theſe very apartments," ſaid ſhe, "this poor ſufferer was confined—here he"—Adeline ſtarted, and thought ſhe heard a ſound; but the ſtillneſs of night was undiſturbed.—"In theſe very chambers." ſaid ſhe, "theſe lines were written—theſe lines from which he then derived a comfort in believing they would hereafter be read by ſome pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eye: this time is now come.

                     <p>A hollow ſigh ſeemed to paſs near her.

She was alſo afraid to move and almoſt to breathe. As ſhe liſtened to the wind, that murmured at the caſements of her lonely chamber, ſhe again thought ſhe heard a ſigh.

exact form ſhe could not diſtinguiſh, appeared to paſs along an obſcure part of the chamber; a dreadful chillneſs came over her, and ſhe ſat fixed in her chair. At length a deep ſigh ſomewhat relieved her oppreſſed ſpirits, and her ſenſes ſeemed to return.</p>
                     <p>All remaining quiet, after ſome time ſhe began to queſtion whether her fancy had not deceived her, and ſhe ſo far conquered her terror as to deſiſt from calling Madame La Motte: her mind was, however, ſo much diſturbed, that ſhe did not venture to truſt herſelf that night again with the MS. but having ſpent ſome time in prayer, and in endeavouring to compoſe her ſpirits, ſhe retired to bed.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe awoke in the morning, the cheerful ſun beams played upon the caſements, and diſpelled the illuſions of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: her mind, ſoothed and invigorated by ſleep, rejected the myſtic and turbulent promptings of imagination. She aroſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed and thankful; but, upon going down to breakfaſt, this tranſient gleam of peace fled upon the appearance of the Marquis, whoſe frequent viſits at the abbey, after what had paſſed, not only diſpleaſed, but alarmed her. She ſaw that he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to perſevere in addreſſing her, and the boldneſs and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of this conduct, while it excited her indignation, increaſed her diſguſt. In pity to La Motte, ſhe endeavoured to conceal theſe emotions, though ſhe now thought that he required too much from her complaiſance, and began ſeriouſly to conſider how ſhe might avoid the neceſſity of continuing it. The Marquis behaved to her with the moſt reſpectful attention: but Adeline was ſilent and reſerved, and ſeized the firſt opportunity of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe paſſed up the ſpiral ſtaircaſe, Peter entered the hall below, and ſeeing Adeline, he ſtopped and looked earneſtly at her: ſhe did not obſerve him, but he called her ſoftly, and ſhe then ſaw him make a ſignal as if he had ſomething to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. In the next inſtant La Motte opened the door of the vaulted room, and Peter haſtily diſappeared. She proceeded to her chamber, ruminating upon this ſignal, and the cautious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which Peter had given it.</p>
                     <p>But her thoughts ſoon returned to their wonted ſubjects. Three days were now paſſed, and ſhe heard no intelligence of her father; ſhe began to hope that he had relented from the violent meaſures hinted at by La Motte, and that he meant to purſue a milder plan; but when ſhe conſidered his character, this appeared improbable, and ſhe relapſed into her former fears. Her reſidence at the abbey was now become painful, from the
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029379_0063_0FE08B69F177D568"/>
perſeverance of the Marquis, and the conduct which La Motte obliged her to adopt; yet ſhe could not think without dread of quitting it to return to her father.</p>
                     <p>The image of Theodore often intruded upon her buſy thoughts, and brought with it a pang; which his ſtrange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture occaſioned. She had a confuſed notion, that his fate was ſomehow connected with her own; and her ſtruggles to prevent the remembrance of him, ſerved only to ſhew how much her heart was his.</p>
                     <p>To divert her thoughts from theſe ſubjects, and gratify the curioſity ſo ſtrongly excited on the preceding night, ſhe now took up the MS. but was hindered from opening it by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Madame La Motte, who come to tell her that the Marquis was gone. They paſſed their morning together in work and general converſation; La Motte not appearing till dinner, when he ſaid little, and Adeline leſs. She aſked him however, if he had heard from her father?</p>
                     <p>"I have not heard from him," ſaid La Motte; "but there is good reaſon, as I am informed by the Marquis, to believe he is not far off."</p>
                     <p>Adeline was ſhocked, yet ſhe was able to reply with becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmneſs. "I have already, Sir, envolved you too much in my diſtreſs, and now ſee that reſiſtance will deſtroy you, without ſerving me; I am, therefore contented to return to my father, and thus ſpare you farther calamity."</p>
                     <p>"This is a raſh determination," replied La Motte, "and if you purſue it, I fear you will ſeverely repent. I ſpeak to you as a friend, Adeline, and deſire you will endeavour to liſten to me without prejudice. The Marquis, I find, has offered you his hand.

When ſhe retired, Madame La Motte ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied her to her chamber, and continued to converſe with her for a conſiderable time, ſo that ſhe had no means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an interview with Peter.—Madame La Motte appeared <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

labour under ſome great affliction, and when Adeline, noticing this, entreated to know the cauſe of her dejection, tears ſtarted into her eyes, and ſhe abruptly left the room.</p>
                     <p>This behaviour of Madame La Motte concurred with Peter's diſcourſe, to alarm Adeline, who ſat penſively upon her bed, given up to reflection, till ſhe was rouſed by the ſound of a clock which ſtood in the room below, and which now ſtruck twelve. She was preparing for reſt, when ſhe recollected the MS. and was unable to conclude the night without reading it. The firſt words ſhe could diſtinguiſh were the following.</p>
                     <p>"Again I return to this poor conſolation—again I have been permitted to ſee another day. It is now midnight! my ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary lamp burns beſide me; the time is awful, but to me the ſilence of noon is as the ſilence of midnight: a deeper gloom is all in which they differ. The ſtill, unvarying hours are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered only by my ſufferings! Great God! when ſhall I be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed!</p>
                     <p>"But whence this ſtrange confinement? I have never injured him. If death is deſigned me, why this delay; and for what but death am I brought hither? This abbey—alas,"—Here the MS. was again illegible, and for ſeveral pages Adeline could only make out disjointed ſentences.</p>
                     <p>"O bitter draught! when, when ſhall I have reſt! O my friends will none of ye fly to aid me; will none of ye avenge my ſufferings? Ah! when it is too late—when I am gone for ever, ye will endeavour to avenge them. * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
                     <p>"Once more is night returned to me. Another day has paſſed in ſolitude and miſery.

Alas! even this ſmall comfort is denied me, the windows open towards other parts of this abbey, and admit only a portion of that day which I muſt never more fully behold. Laſt night! laſt night! O ſcene of horror!" * *</p>

The idea thrilled her with horror. She recollected the dagger which had impeded her ſteps in the ſecret chamber, and this circumſtance ſerved to confirm her moſt terrible conjectures. She wiſhed to examine

                     <p>"Wretched, wretched victim!" ſhe exclaimed, "could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She ſtopped and thought ſhe heard a ſigh, ſuch as, on the preceding night had paſſed along the chamber. Her blood was chilled and ſhe ſat motionleſs. The lonely ſituation of her room, remote from the reſt of the family, (for ſhe was now in her old apartment, from which Madame La Motte had removed) who were almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond call, ſtruck ſo forcibly upon her imagination, that ſhe with difficulty preſerved herſelf from fainting. She ſat for a conſiderable time, but all was ſtill. When ſhe was ſomewhat recovered, her firſt deſign was to alarm the family; but farther reflection again withheld her.</p>
                     <p>She endeavoured to compoſe her ſpirits, and addreſſed a ſhort prayer to that Being who had hitherto protected her in eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The reports concerning the abbey—the dreams, which had forerun her diſcovery of the private apartments—the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular manner in which ſhe had found the MS. and the appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhe now believed ſhe had really ſeen. She blamed herſelf for having not yet mentioned the diſcovery of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſcript and chambers to La Motte, and reſolved to delay the diſcloſure no longer than the following morning. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cares that had occupied her mind, and a fear of loſing the manuſcipt before ſhe had read it, had hitherto kept her ſilent.</p>
                     <p>Such a combination of circumſtances ſhe believed could only be produced by ſome ſupernatural power, operating for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution of the guilty. Theſe reflections filled her mind with a degree of awe, which the lonelineſs of the large old chamber in which ſhe ſat, and the hour of the night, ſoon heightened into terror. She had never been ſuperſtitious, but circumſtances ſo uncommon had hitherto conſpired in this affair, that ſhe could not believe them accidental. Her imagination, wrought upon by theſe reflections, again became ſenſible to every impreſſion, ſhe feared to look around, leſt ſhe ſhould again ſee ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful phantom, and ſhe almoſt fancied ſhe heard voices ſwell in the ſtorm, which now ſhook the fabric.</p>
                     <p>Still ſhe tried to command her feelings ſo as to avoid diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the family, but they became ſo painful, that even the dread of La Motte's ridicule had hardly power to prevent her quitting the chamber. Her mind was now in ſuch a ſtate, that ſhe found it impoſſible to purſue the ſtory in the MS. though to avoid the tortures of ſuſpenſe, ſhe had attempted it. She laid it down again and tried to argue herſelf into compoſure. "What have I to fear?" ſaid ſhe, "I am at leaſt innocent, and I ſhall not be puniſhed for the crime of another."</p>

                     <p>"Why, Ma'amſelle, when he ſaid this, I took at him his word and went to the door, where, ſure enough, I heard my maſter and the Marquis talking about you. They ſaid a great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Monſieur La Motte then told the Marquis, if he would return to the abbey upon ſuch a night, meaning this very night, Ma'amſelle, every thing ſhould be prepared according to his

                     <p>At theſe words, Adeline claſped her hands and raiſed her eyes to heaven in ſilent deſpair.—Peter went on. "When I heard this, I could not doubt what Jacques had ſaid.—Well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid he, what do you think of it now?"—"Why, that my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's a raſcal, ſays I."—"It's well you don't think mine our too, ſays he,"—"Why as for that ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"She was not preſent at this converſation then?" ſaid Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line. "No, Ma'amſelle, but my maſter has told her of it, I warrant." Adeline was almoſt as much ſhocked by this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent perfidy of Madame La Motte, as by a knowledge of the deſtruction that threatened her. After muſing a few moments in extreme agitation, "Peter," ſaid ſhe, "you have a good heart, and feel a juſt indignation at your maſter's treachery—will you aſſiſt me to eſcape?"</p>
                     <p>"Ah, Ma'amſelle!" ſaid he, "how can I aſſiſt you; beſides, where can we go? I have no friends about here, no more than yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"O!" replied Adeline, in extreme emotion, "we fly from enemies; ſtrangers may prove friends: aſſiſt me but to eſcape from this foreſt, and you will claim my eternal gratitude: I have no fears beyond it."</p>
                     <p>"Why, as for this foreſt," replied Peter, I am weary of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But theſe ghoſts that haunt the abbey, I am no more a coward than other men, but I don't like them: and there <hi>is</hi> ſo many ſtrange reports abroad; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"You conſent, then, to aſſiſt me in eſcaping?" ſaid Adeline with eagerneſs.</p>
                     <p>"Why as to that, Ma'amſelle, I would willingly if I knew where to go. To be ſure I have a ſiſter lives in Savoy, but that is a great way off: and I have ſaved a little money out of my wages, but that won't carry us ſuch a long journey."</p>
                     <p>"Regard not that," ſaid Adeline, "If I was once beyond this foreſt I would then endeavour to take care of myſelf, and repay you for your kindneſs."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="135" facs="unknown:029379_0068_0FE08B9069DC9D20"/>"O! as for that, Madam"—Well, well, Peter, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how we may eſcape. This night, ſay you, this night— the Marquis is to return?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, Ma'amſelle, to night, about dark. I have juſt thought of a ſcheme: My maſter's horſes are grazing in the foreſt, we may take one of them, and ſend it back from the firſt ſtage: but how ſhall we avoid being ſeen? beſides if we go off in the day light, he will ſoon purſue and overtake us; and if you ſtay till night, the Marquis will be come, and then there is no chance. If they miſs us both at the ſame time too, they'll gueſs how it is, and ſet off directly. Could not you contrive to go firſt and wait for me till the hurly burly's over? Then, while they're ſearching in the place under ground for you, I can ſlip away, and we ſhould be out of their reach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought of purſuing us."</p>
                     <p>Adeline agreed to the truth of all this, and was ſomewhat ſurpriſed at Peter's ſagacity. She inquired if he knew of any place in the neighbourhood of the abbey, where ſhe could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main concealed ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he came with the horſe. "Why yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam there is a place, now I think of it where you may be ſafe enough, for no body goes near: but they ſay it's haunted, and, perhaps, you would not like to go there." Adeline, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the laſt night, was ſomewhat ſtartled at this intelligence; but a ſenſe of her preſent danger preſſed again upon her mind, and overcame every other apprehenſion. Where is this place?" ſaid ſhe, "if it will conceal me, I ſhall not heſitate to go."</p>
                     <p>"It is an old tomb that ſtands in the thickeſt part of the foreſt about a quarter of a mile off the neareſt way, and almoſt a mile the other. When my maſter uſed to hide himſelf ſo much in the foreſt, I have followed him ſomewhere thereabouts, but I did not find out the tomb till the other day. However, that's neither here nor there; if you dare venture to it, Ma'am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle, I'll ſhew you the neareſt way." So ſaying, he pointed to a winding path on the right. Adeline, having looked round without perceiving any perſon near, directed Peter to lead her to the tomb: they purſued the path till turning into a gloomy romantic part of the foreſt almoſt impervious to the rays of the ſun, they came to the ſpot whither Louis had formerly traced his father.</p>
                     <p>The ſtillneſs and ſolemnity of the ſcene ſtruck awe upon the heart of Adeline, who pauſed and ſurveyed it for ſome time in ſilence. At length, Peter led her into the interior part of the ruin, to which they deſcended by ſeveral ſteps. "Some old

Abbot," ſaid he, "was formerly buried here as the Marquis's people ſay; and it's like enough that he belonged to the abbey yonder. But I don't ſee why he ſhould take it in his head to walk; <hi>he</hi> was not murdered, ſurely?"</p>
                     <p>"I hope not," ſaid Adeline.</p>
                     <p>"That's more than can be ſaid for all that lies buried at the abbey though, and"—Adeline interrupted him; "Hark! ſurely I hear a noiſe?" ſaid ſhe, "Heaven protect us from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery!" They liſtened, but all was ſtill, and they went on. Peter opened a low door, and they entered upon a dark paſſage, frequently obſtructed by loſe fragments of ſtone, and along which they moved with caution. Whither are we going?" ſaid Adeline—"I ſcarcely know myſelf," ſaid Peter, "for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſo far before; but the place ſeems quite enough." Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing obſtructed his way; it was a door, which yielded to his hand, and diſcovered a kind of cell, obſcurely ſeen by the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light admitted through a grate above. A partial gleam ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> athwart the place, leaving the greateſt part of it in ſhadow.</p>
                     <p>Adeline ſighed as ſhe ſurveyed it. "This is a frightful ſpot, ſaid ſhe, "but if it will afford me a ſhelter, it is a palace. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Peter, that my peace and honour depend upon your faithfulneſs; be both diſcreet and reſolute. In the duſk of the evening I can paſs from the abbey with leaſt danger of being obſerved, and in this cell I will wait your arrival. As ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"I will, Ma'amſelle, let come what may."</p>
                     <p>They re-aſcended to the foreſt, and Adeline fearful of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, directed Peter to run faſt to the abbey, and invent ſome excuſe for his abſence, if he had been miſſed. When ſhe was again alone, ſhe yielded to a flood of tears, and indulged the exceſs of her diſtreſs. She ſaw herſelf without friends, without relations, deſtitute, forlorn, and abandoned to the worſt of evils. Betrayed by the very perſons, to whoſe comfort ſhe had ſo long adminiſtered, whom ſhe had loved as her protectors, and revered as her parents! Theſe reflections touched her heart with the moſt afflicting ſenſations, and the ſenſe of her imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate danger was for a while abſorbed in the grief occaſioned by a diſcovery of ſuch guilt in others.</p>
                     <p>At length ſhe rouſed all her fortitude, and turning towards the abbey, endeavoured to await with patience the hour of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029379_0069_0FE08B9F52B5B7F8"/>
and to ſuſtain an appearance, of compoſure in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Monſieur and Madame La Motte. For the preſent ſhe wiſhed to avoid ſeeing either of them, doubting her ability to diſguiſe her emotions: having reached the abbey, ſhe therefore paſſed on to her chamber. Here ſhe endeavoured to direct her attention to indifferent ſubjects, but in vain; the danger of her ſituation, and the ſevere diſappointment ſhe had received, in the character of thoſe whom ſhe had ſo much eſteemed, and even loved, preſſed hard upon her thoughts. To a generous mind few circumſtances are more afflicting than a diſcovery of perfidy in thoſe whom we have truſted, even though it may fail of any abſolute inconvenience to ourſelves. The behaviour of Madame La Motte in thus, by concealment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring to her deſtruction, particularly ſhocked her.</p>
                     <p>"How has my imagination deceived me!" ſaid ſhe; "what a picture did it draw of the goodneſs of the world! And muſt I then believe that every body is cruel and deceitful? No— let me ſtill be deceived, and ſtill ſuffer, rather than be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to a ſtate of ſuch wretched ſuſpicion." She now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to extenute the conduct of Madame La Motte, by attributing it to a fear of her huſband. "She dare not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his will," ſaid ſhe, "elſe ſhe would warn me of my dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and aſſiſt me to eſcape from it. No—I will never believe her capable of conſpiring my ruin. Terror alone keeps her ſilent."</p>
                     <p>Adeline was ſomewhat comforted by this thought. The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her heart taught her, in this inſtance, to ſophiſticate. She perceived not, that by aſcribing the conduct of Madame La Motte to terror, ſhe only ſoftened the degree of her guilt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting it to a motive leſs depraved, but not leſs ſelfiſh. She remained in her chamber till ſummoned to dinner, when, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her tears, ſhe deſcended with faltering ſteps and a palpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heart to the parlour. When ſhe ſaw La Motte, in ſpite of all her efforts. She trembled and grew pale: ſhe could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, even with apparent indifference, the man who ſhe knew had deſtined her to deſtruction. He obſerved her emotion, and inquiring if ſhe was ill, ſhe ſaw the danger to which her agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expoſed her. Fearful leſt La Motte ſhould ſuſpect its true cauſe, ſhe ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lied all her ſpirits, and with a look of complacency, anſwered ſhe was well.</p>
                     <p>During dinner ſhe p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erved a degree of compoſure, that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually concealed the varied anguiſh of her heart. When ſhe looked at La Motte, terror and indignation were her prodimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029379_0070_0FE069930609DE30"/>
feelings; but when ſhe regarded Madame La Motte, it was otherwiſe; gratitude for her former tenderneſs had long been confirmed into affection and her heart now ſwelled with the bitterneſs of grief and diſappointment. Madame La Motte appeared depreſſed, and ſaid little. La Motte ſeemed anxious to prevent thought, by aſſuming a fictitious and unnatural gaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he laughed and talked, and threw off frequent bumpers of wine: it was the mirth of deſperation. Madame became alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and would have reſtrained him, but he perſiſted in his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations to Bacchus till reflection ſeemed to be almoſt overcome.</p>
                     <p>Madame La Motte, fearful that in the careleſsneſs of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment he might betray himſelf, withdrew with Adeline to another room. Adeline recollected the happy hours ſhe once paſſed with her, when confidence baniſhed reſerve, and ſympathy and eſteem dictated the ſentiments of friendſhip: now thoſe hours were gone for ever; ſhe could no longer unboſom her griefs to Madame La Motte; no longer even eſteem her. Yet notwithſtanding all the danger to which ſhe was expoſed by the criminal ſilence of the latter, ſhe could not converſe with her, conſciouſly for the laſt time, without feeling a degree of ſorrow, which wiſdom may call weakneſs, but to which bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence will allow a ſofter name.</p>
                     <p>Madame La Motte, in her converſation, appeared to labour under an almoſt equal oppreſſion with Adeline: her thoughts were abſtracted from the ſubject of diſcourſe, and there we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> long and frequent intervals of ſilence. Adeline more than once caught her gazing with a look of tenderneſs upon her, and ſaw her eyes fill with tears. By this circumſtance ſhe was ſo much affected, that, ſhe was ſeveral times upon the point of throwing herſelf at her feet, and imploring her pity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Cooler reflection ſhewed her the extravagance and danger of this conduct; ſhe ſuppreſſed her emotions, but they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> length compelled her to withdraw from the preſence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame La Motte.</p>

"A few hours," reſumed Adeline, "and the Marquis will arrive—a few hours, and this abbey will be a ſcene of confuſion and tumult: every eye will be in ſearch of me, every receſs will be explored."

No perſon appeared, and ſhe proceeded through the door of the tower into the foreſt. She loooked around; the gloom of the evening obſcured every object.</p>
                     <p>With a trembling heart ſhe ſought the path pointed out by Peter, which led to the tomb; having found it, ſhe paſſed along forlorn and terrified. Often did ſhe ſtart as the breeze ſhook the light leaves of the trees, or as the bat flitted by, gamboling in the twilight; and often, as ſhe looked back towards the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed, amid the deepening gloom, the figures of men. Having proceeded ſome way, ſhe ſuddenly heard the feet of horſes, and ſoon after a ſound of voices, among
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029379_0071_0FE08BB23659DD38"/>
which ſhe diſtinguiſhed that of the Marquis: they ſeemed to come from the quarter ſhe was approa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hing, and evidently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced. Terror for ſome minutes arreſted her ſteps; ſhe ſtood in a ſtate of dreadful heſitation: to proceed was to run into the hands of the Marquis; to return was to fall into the power of La Motte.</p>
                     <p>After remaining for ſome time uncertain whither to fly, the ſounds ſuddenly took a different direction, and wheeled towards the abbey. Adeline had a ſhort ceſſation of terror. She now underſtood that the Marquis had paſſed this ſpot only in his way to the abbey, and ſhe haſtened to ſecret herſelf in the ruin. At length, after much difficulty ſhe reached it, the deep ſhades almoſt concealing it from her ſearch. She pauſed at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, awed by the ſolemnity that reigned within, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs of the place; at length ſhe determined to watch without till Peter ſhould arrive. "If any perſon approaches," ſaid ſhe, "I can hear them before they can ſee me, and I can then ſecret myſelf in the cell."</p>
                     <p>She leaned againſt a fragment of the tomb in trembling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and as ſhe liſtened, no ſound broke the ſilence of the hour. The ſtate of her mind can only be imagined, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that upon the preſent time turned the criſis of her fate. "They have now," thought ſhe, "diſcovered my flight; even now they are ſeeking me in every part of the abbey. I hear their dreadful voices call me; I ſee their eager looks." The power of imagination almoſt overcame her. While ſhe yet looked around, ſhe ſaw lights moving at a diſtance; ſometimes they glimmered between the trees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſometimes they totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared.</p>
                     <p>They ſeemed to be in a direction with the abbey: and ſhe now remembered, that in the morning ſhe had ſeen a part of the fabric through an opening in the foreſt. She had, therefore, no doubt that the lights ſhe ſaw proceeded from people in ſearch of her; who, ſhe feared, not finding her at the abbey, might direct their ſteps towards the tomb. Her place of refuge now ſeemed too near her enemies to be ſafe, and ſhe would have fled to a more diſtant part of the foreſt, but recollected that Peter would not know where to find her.</p>
                     <p>While theſe thoughts paſſed over her mind, ſhe heard diſtant voices in the wind, and was haſtening to conceal herſelf in the cell, when ſhe obſerved the lights ſuddenly diſappear. All was ſoon after huſhed in ſilence and darkneſs, yet ſhe endeavoured to find the way to the cell. She remembered the ſituation of the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029379_0071_0FE08BB23659DD38"/>
outer door and of the paſſage, and having paſſed theſe, ſhe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed the door of the cell. Within it was utterly dark. She trembled violently, but entered; and having felt about the walls, at length ſeated herſelf on a projection of ſtone.</p>
                     <p>She here again addreſſed herſelf to Heaven, and, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reanimate her ſpirits till Peter ſhould arrive. Above half an hour elapſed in this gloomy receſs, and no ſound fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told his approach. Her ſpirits ſunk, ſhe feared ſome part of their plan was diſcovered, or interrupted, and that he was detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by La Motte. This conviction operated ſometimes ſo ſtrongly upon her fears, as to urge her to quit the cell alone, and ſeek in flight her only chance of eſcape.</p>
                     <p>While this deſign was fluctuating in her mind, ſhe diſtinguiſhed through the grate above a clattering of hoofs. The noiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached, and at length ſtopped at the tomb. In the ſucceeding moment ſhe heard three ſtrokes of a whip: her heart beat, and for ſome moments her agitation was ſuch, that ſhe made no effort to quit the cell. The ſtrokes were repeated: ſhe now rouſed her ſpirits, and, ſtepping forward, aſcended to the foreſt. She called "Peter;" for the deep gloom would not permit her to diſtinguiſh either man or horſe. She was quickly anſwered, "Huſh! Ma'amſelle, our voices will betray us."</p>
                     <p>They mounted and rode off as faſt as the darkneſs would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Adeline's heart revived at eveey ſtep they took. She in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what had paſſed at the abbey, and how he had contrived to get away. "Speak ſoftly, Ma'amſelle; you'll know all by and by, but I can't tell you now." He had ſcarcely ſpoke ere they ſaw lights move along at a diſtance; and coming now to a more open part of the foreſt, he ſet off on a full gallop, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the pace till the horſe could hold it no longer. They looked back, and no lights appearing, Adeline's terror ſubſided. She inquired again what had paſſed at the abbey, when her flight was diſcovered. "You may ſpeak without fear of being heard," ſaid ſhe, "we are gone beyond their reach I hope."</p>
                     <p>"Why, Ma'amſelle," ſaid he, "you had not been gone long before the Marquis arrived, and Monſieur La Motte then found out you was fled. Upon this a great rout there was, and he talked a great deal with the Marquis."</p>
                     <p>"Speak louder," ſaid Adeline, "I cannot hear you."</p>
                     <p>"I will Ma'amſelle."—</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Heavens!" interrupted Adeline, what voice is this? It is not Peter's. For God's ſake tell me who you are, and whither I am going?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="unknown:029379_0072_0FE08BB847F33F70"/>"You'll know that ſoon enough, young lady," anſwered the ſtranger, for it was indeed not Peter; "I am taking you where my maſter ordered." Adeline, not doubting he was the Marquis's ſervant, attempted to leap to the ground, but the man diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, bound her to the horſe. One feeble ray of hope at length beamed upon her mind: ſhe endeavoured to ſoften the man to pity, and pleaded with all the genuine eloquence of diſtreſs; but he underſtood his intereſt too well to yield even for a moment to the compaſſion, which, in ſpite of himſelf, her artleſs ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation inſpired.</p>
                     <p>She now reſigned herſelf to deſpair, and, in paſſive ſilence, ſubmitted to her fate. They continued thus to travel, till a ſtorm of rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, drove them to the covert of a thick grove. The man believed this a ſafe ſituation, and Adeline was now too carleſs of life to attempt convincing him of his error. The ſtorm was violent and long, but as ſoon as it abated they ſet off on full gallop, and having continued to travel for about two hours, they came to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the foreſt, and ſoon after, to a high lonely wall, which Adeline could juſt diſtinguiſh by the moonlight, which now ſtreamed through the parting clouds.</p>
                     <p>Here they ſtopped; the man diſmounted, and having opened a ſmall door in the wall, he unbound Adeline, who ſhrieked, though involuntarily and in vain, as he took her from the horſe. The door opened upon a narrow paſſage, dimly lighted by a lamp, which hung at the farther end. He led her on; they came to another door; it opened and diſcloſed a magnificent ſaloon, ſplendidly illuminated, and fitted up in the moſt airy and elegant taſte.</p>
                     <p>The walls were painted in freſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o, repreſenting ſcenes from Ovid, and hung above with ſilk drawn up in feſtoons and richly fringed. The ſofas were of a ſilk to ſuit the hangings. From the centre of the ceiling, which exhibited a ſcene from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mida of Taſſo, deſcended a ſilver lamp of Etruſcan form; it diffuſed a blaze of light that reflected from large pier glaſſes, completely illuminated the ſaloon. Buſts of Horace, Ovid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acreon, Tibullus, and Petronius Arbiter, adorned the receſſes, and ſtands of flowers, placed in Etruſcan vaſes, breathed the moſt delicious perfume. In the middle of the apartment ſtood a ſmall table, ſpread with a collation of fruits, ices and liquors. No perſon appeared. The whole ſeemed the works of enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and rather reſembled the palace of a fairy than any thing of human conformation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="143" facs="unknown:029379_0072_0FE08BB847F33F70"/>Adeline was aſtoniſhed, and inquired were ſhe was, but the man refuſed to anſwer her queſtions, and having deſired her to take ſome refreſhment, left her. She walked to the windows, from which a gleam of moonlight diſcovered to her an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive garden, where groves and lawns, and water glittering in the moonbeam, compoſed a ſcenery of varied and romantic beauty. "What can this mean!" ſaid ſhe: "Is this a charm to lure me to deſtruction? She endeavoured, with a hope of eſcaping, to open the windows, but they were all faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened; ſhe next attempted ſeveral doors, and found them alſo ſecured.</p>
                     <p>Perceiving all chance of eſcape was removed ſhe remained for ſome time given up to ſorrow and reflection; but was at length drawn from her reverie by the notes of ſoft muſic, breathing ſuch dulcet and entrancing ſounds, as ſuſpended grief, and awakened the ſoul to tenderneſs and penſive pleaſure. Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line liſtened in ſurpriſe, and inſenſibly became ſoothed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted; a tender melancholy ſtole upon her heart, and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every haſher feeling: but the moment the ſtrain ceaſed, the enchantment diſſolved, and ſhe returned to a ſenſe of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Again the muſic ſounded—"muſic ſuch as charmeth ſleep" and again ſhe gradually yielded to its ſweet magic. A female voice accompanied by a lute, a hautboy, and a few other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, now gradually ſwelled into a tone ſo exquiſite, as raiſed attention into ecſtacy. It ſunk by degrees, and touched a few ſimple notes with pathetic ſoftneſs, when the meaſure was ſuddenly changed, and in a gay and airy melody Adeline diſtinguiſhed the following words:

He approached the ſofa where Adeline ſat, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed her, but ſhe heard not his voice—ſhe had fainted. He endeavoured to recover her, and at length ſucceeded; but when ſhe uncloſed her eyes, and again beheld him, ſhe relapſed into a ſtate of inſenſibility, and having in vain tried various methods to reſtore her, he was obliged to call aſſiſtance. Two young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men entered, and when ſhe began to revive, he left them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare her for his re-appearance. When Adeline perceived that the Marquis was gone, and that ſhe was in the care of women, her ſpirits gradually returned; ſhe looked at her attendants, and was ſurpriſed to ſee ſo much elegance and beauty.</p>
                     <p>Some endeavour ſhe made to intereſt their pity, but they ſeemed wholly inſenſible to her diſtreſs, and began to talk of the Marquis in terms of the higheſt admiration. They aſſured her it would be her own fault if ſhe was not happy and adviſed her to appear ſo in his preſence. It was with the utmoſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty that Adeline forbore to expreſs the diſdain which was riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her lips, and that ſhe liſtened to their diſcourſe in ſilence. But ſhe ſaw the inconvenience and fruitleſſneſs of oppoſition, and ſhe commanded her feelings.</p>
                     <p>They were thus proceeding in their praiſes of the Marquis, when he himſelf appeared, and, waving his hand, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately quitted the apartment. Adeline beheld him with a kind of mute deſpair, while he approached and took her hand, which ſhe haſtily with drew, and turning from him with a look of unutterable diſtreſs, burſt into tears. He was for ſome time ſilent, and appeared ſoftened by her anguiſh. But again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, and addreſſing her in a gentle voice, he entreated her pardon for the ſtep, which deſpair, and, as he called it, love had prompted. She was too much abſorbed in grief to reply, till he ſolicited a return of his love, when her ſorrow yielded to indignation, and ſhe reproached him with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. He pleaded that he had long loved and ſought her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on honorable terms, and his offer of thoſe terms he began to repeat, but, raiſing his eyes towards Adeline, he ſaw in her looks the contempt which he was conſcious he deſerved.</p>
                     <p>For a moment he was confuſed, and ſeemed to underſtand both that his plan was diſcovered and his perſon deſpiſed; but ſoon reſuming his uſual command of feature, he again preſſed his ſuit, and ſolicited her love. A little reflection ſhewed
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029379_0073_0FE08BC72A8B6F08"/>
Adeline the danger of exaſperating his pride, by an avowal of the contempt which his pretended offer of marriage excited; and ſhe thought it not improper, upon an occaſion in which the honour and peace of her life was concerned, to yield ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the policy of diſſimulation. She ſaw that her only chance of eſcaping his deſigns depended upon delaying them, and ſhe now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wiſhed him to believe her ignorant that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs was living, and that his offers were deluſive.</p>
                     <p>He obſerved her pauſe, and, in the eagerneſs to turn her he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation to his advantage, renewed his propoſal with increaſed vehemence.—"To morrow ſhall unite us, lovely Adeline; to morrow you ſhall conſent to become the Marchioneſs de Montalt. You will then return my love and"—</p>
                     <p>"You muſt firſt deſerve my eſteem, my Lord."</p>
                     <p>"I will—I do deſerve it. Are you not now in my power, and do I not forbear to take advantage of your ſituation? Do I not make you the moſt honourable propoſals?"—Adeline ſhuddered: "If you wiſh I ſhould eſteem you, my Lord, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour if poſſible, to make me forget by what means I came into your power; if your views are, indeed honourable, prove them ſo by releaſing me from my confinement."</p>
                     <p>"Can you then wiſh, lovely Adeline, to fly from him who adores you?" replied the Marquis, with a ſtudied air of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs. "Why will you exact ſo ſevere a proof of my diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſtedneſs, a diſintereſtedneſs which is not conſiſtent with love? No, charming Adeline, let me at leaſt have the pleaſure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding you, till the bonds of the church ſhall remove every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to my love. To morrow."—</p>
                     <p>Adeline ſaw the danger to which ſhe was now expoſed, and interrupted him. "<hi>Deſerve</hi> my eſteem, Sir, and then you will <hi>obtain</hi> it: as a firſt ſtep towards which, liberate me from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement that obliges me to look on you only with terror and averſion. How can I believe your profeſſions of love, while you ſhew that you have no intereſt in my happineſs?" Thus did Adeline, to whom the arts and the practice of diſſimulation were hitherto equally unknown, condeſcend to make uſe of them in diſguiſing her indignation and contempt. But though theſe arts were adopted only for the purpoſe of ſelf preſervation, ſhe uſed them with reluctance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and almoſt with abhorrence; for her mind was habitually impregnated with the love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in thought, word, and action, and, while her end in uſing them was certainly good, ſhe ſcarcely thought that end could juſtify the means.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="146" facs="unknown:029379_0074_0FE08BCC15C3EA28"/>The Marquis perſiſted in his ſophiſtry. "Can you doubt the reality of that love, which, to obtain you, has urged me to riſque your diſpleaſure? But have I not conſulted your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, even in the very conduct which you condemn? I have removed you from a ſolitary and deſolate ruin, to a gay and ſplendid villa, where every luxury is at your command, and where every perſon ſhall be obedient to your wiſhes."</p>
                     <p>"My firſt wiſh is to go hence," ſaid Adeline; "I entreat, I conjure you, my Lord, no longer to detain me. I am a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and wretched orphan, expoſed to many evils, and I fear abandoned to misfortune: I do not wiſh to be rude; but allow me to ſay, that no miſery can exceed that I ſhall feel in remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here, or, indeed, in being any where purſued by the offers you make me!" Adeline had now forgot her policy: tears prevented her from proceeding, and ſhe turned away her face to hide her emotion.</p>
                     <p>"By Heaven! Adeline, you do me wrong," ſaid the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, riſing from his ſeat and ſeizing her hand; "I love, I adore you; yet you doubt my paſſion, and are inſenſible to my vows. Every pleaſure poſſible to be enjoyed within theſe walls you ſhall partake, but beyond them you ſhall not go." She diſengaged her hand, and in ſilent anguiſh walked to a diſtant part of the ſaloon; deep ſighs burſt from her heart, and, almoſt fainting, ſhe leaned on a window frame for ſupport.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis followed her; "Why thus obſtinately perſiſt in refuſing to be happy?" ſaid he; "recollect the propoſal I have made you, and accept it, while it is yet in your power. To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a prieſt ſhall join our hands—Surely, being as you are in my power, it muſt be your intereſt to conſent to this?" Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line could anſwer only by tears; ſhe diſpaired of ſoftening his heart to pity, and feared to exaſperate his pride by diſdain. He now led her, and ſhe ſuffered him, to a ſeat near the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, at which he preſſed her to partake of a variety of confec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaries, particularly of ſome liquors, of which he himſelf drank freely: Adeline accepted only of a peach.</p>

                     <p>When the voice ceaſed, a mournful ſtrain, played with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite expreſſion, ſounded from a diſtant horn; ſometimes the notes floated on the air in ſoft undulations—now they ſwelled into full and ſweeping melody, and now died faintly into ſilence: when again they roſe and trembled in ſounds ſo ſweetly tender, as drew tears from Adeline, and exclamations of rapture from the Marquis; he threw his arm round her, and would have preſſed her towards him, but ſhe liberated herſelf from his embrace, and with a look, on which was impreſſed the firm dignity of virtue, yet touched with ſorrow, ſhe awed him to forbearance. Conſcious of a ſuperiority, which he was aſhamed to acknowledge, and endeavouring to diſpiſe the influence which he could not reſiſt, he ſtood for a moment, the ſlave of virtue, though the votary of vice. Soon, however, he recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered his confidence, and began to plead his love; when Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line no longer animated by the ſpirit ſhe had lately ſhewn, and ſinking beneath the languor and fatigue which the various and violent agitations of her mind produced, entreated he would leave her to repoſe.</p>
                     <p>The paleneſs of her countenance, and the tremulous tone of her voice, were too expreſſive to be miſunderſtood; and the Marquis, bidding her remember to morrow, with ſome heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion withdrew. The moment ſhe was alone, ſhe yielded to the burſting anguiſh of her heart, and was ſo abſorbed in grief, that it was ſometime before ſhe perceived ſhe was in the preſence of the young women, who had lately attended her, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſaloon ſoon after the Marquis quitted it: they came to conduct her to her chamber. She followed them for ſome time in ſilence, till prompted by deſperation, ſhe again endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to awaken their compaſſion; but again the praiſes of the Marquis were repeated, and perceiving that all attempts to
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029379_0075_0FE08BD78F32D2C8"/>
intereſt them in her favour were in vain, ſhe diſmiſſed them. She ſecured the door through which they had departed, and then, in the languid hope of diſcovering ſome means of eſcape, ſhe ſurveyed her chamber. The airy elegance with which it was fitted up, and the luxurious accommodations with which it abounded, ſeemed deſigned to faſcinate the imagination, and to ſeduce the heart. The hangings were of ſtraw coloured ſilk, adorned with a variety of landſcapes and hiſtorical paintings, the ſubject of which partook of the voluptuous character of the owner; the chimney peice, of Parian marble, was ornamented with ſeveral repoſing figures from the antique. The bed was of ſilk the colour of the hangings, richly fringed with purple and ſilver, and the head made in form of a canopy. The ſteps, which were placed near the bed to aſſiſt in aſcending it, were ſupported by Cupids, apparently of ſolid ſilver, China vaſes, fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with perſume, ſtood in ſeveral of the receſſes, upon ſtands of the ſame ſtructure as the toilet, which was magnificent, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented with a variety of trinkets.</p>
                     <p>Adeline threw a tranſient look upon theſe various objects, and proceeded to examine the windows, which deſcended to the floor, and opened into belconies towards the garden ſhe had ſeen from the ſaloon. They were now faſtened, and her efforts to move them were ineffectual; at length ſhe gave up the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. A door next attracted her notice, which ſhe found was not faſtened; it opened upon a dreſſing cloſet, to which ſhe deſcended by a few ſteps: two windows appeared, ſhe haſtened towards them; one refuſed to yield, but her heart beat with ſudden joy when the other opened to her touch.</p>
                     <p>In the tranſport of the moment ſhe forgot that its diſtance from the ground might yet deny the eſcape ſhe meditated. She returned to lock the door of the cloſet, to prevent a ſurpriſe, which, however was unneceſſary, that of the bed room being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſecured. She now looked out from the window; the garden lay before her, and ſhe perceived that the window, which deſcended to the floor, was ſo near the ground, that ſhe might jump from it with eaſe: almoſt in the moment ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this, ſhe ſprang forward and alighted ſafely in an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive garden, reſembling more an Engliſh pleaſure ground, than a ſeries of French parterres.</p>
                     <p>Thence ſhe had little doubt of eſcaping either by ſome brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en fence, or low part of the wall; ſhe tripped lightly along, for hope played round her heart. The clou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and ſpangled the flowerets, yet heavy with rain drops, afforded her a diſtinct view of the ſurrounding ſcenery: ſhe followed the direction of the high wall that adjoined the chateau, till it was concealed from her ſight by a thick wilderneſs, ſo entangled with boughs and obſcured by darkneſs, that ſhe feared to enter, and turned aſide into a walk on the right; it conducted her to the margin of a lake overhung with lofty trees.</p>

The ſcene around exhibited only images of peace and delight; every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſeemed to repoſe; not a breath waved the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She ſtill purſued the windings of the ſhore, till an opening in the woods conducted her up a gentle aſcent: the path now wound along the ſide of a hill, where the gloom was ſo deep that it was with ſome difficulty ſhe found her way: ſuddenly however, the avenue opened to a lofty grove, and ſhe perceived a light iſſue from a rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She pauſed, and her firſt impulſe was to retreat, but liſtening and hearing no ſound, a faint hope beamed upon her mind, that the perſon to whom the light belonged might be one to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour her eſcape. She advanced with trembling and cautious ſteps towards the receſs, that ſhe might ſecretly obſerve the perſon, before ſhe ventured to enter it. Her emotion increaſed as ſhe approached, and having reached the bower, ſhe, beheld through an open window, the Marquis, reclining on a ſofa, near which ſtood a table covered with fruit and wine. He was alone, and his countenance was fluſhed with drinking.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe gazed, fixed to the ſpot by terror, he looked up towards the caſement; the light gleamed full upon her face, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="151" facs="unknown:029379_0076_0FE08BDC21FD2C00"/>
She knew if the Marquis detected her in an attempt to eſcape, he would, probably, burſt the bounds which he had hitherto preſcribed to himſelf, and that ſhe had the moſt dreadful evils to expect. The palpitations of terror were ſo ſtrong, that ſhe could with difficulty breathe.</p>
                     <p>She watched and liſtened in trembling expectation, but no form met her eye, no ſound her ear, in this ſtate ſhe remained a conſiderable time. She wept, and the tears ſhe ſhed relieved her oppreſſed heart. "O my father!" ſaid ſhe, "why did you abandon your child? If you knew the dangers to which you have expoſed her, you would, ſurely, pity and relieve her. Alas! ſhall I never find a friend; am I deſtined ſtill to truſt and be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? —Peter too, could he be treacherous?" She wept again, and then returned to a ſenſe of her preſent danger, and to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the means of eſcaping it; but no means appeared.</p>
                     <p>To her imagination the grounds were boundleſs; ſhe had wandered from lawn to lawn, and from grove to grove, without perceiving any termination to the place; the garden wall ſhe could not find, but ſhe reſolved neither to return to the chateau, nor to relinquiſh her ſearch. As ſhe was riſing to depart ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſhadow move along at ſome diſtance; ſhe ſtood ſtill to obſerve it.

Footſteps purſued her, and ſhe heard her name repeated, while ſhe in vain endeavoured to quicken her pace.</p>
                     <p>Suddenly the ſound of purſuit turned, and ſunk away in a different direction: ſhe pauſed to take breath; ſhe looked around and no perſon appeared. She now proceeded ſlowly along the avenue, and had almoſt reached its termination, when ſhe ſaw the ſame figure emerge from the woods and dart acroſs the av<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enue; it inſtantly purſued her and approached. A voice called her, but ſhe was gone beyond its reach, for ſhe had ſunk ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon the ground: it was long before ſhe revived, when ſhe did, ſhe ſound herſelf in the arms of a ſtranger, and made an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Fear nothing, lovely Adeline," ſaid he, "fear nothing: you are in the arms of a friend, who will encounter any hazard for your ſake; who will protect you with his life." He preſſed her gently to his heart. "Have you then forgot me?" continued he. She looked earneſtly at him, and was now convinced that it was Theodore who ſpoke.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="152" facs="unknown:029379_0077_0FE08BEDC52926D8"/>Joy was her firſt emotion; but recollecting his former abrupt departure at a time ſo critical to her ſafety, and that he was the friend of the Marquis, a thouſand mingled ſenſations ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in her breaſt, overwhelmed her with miſtruſt, apprehenſion, and diſappointment.</p>
                     <p>Theodore raiſed her from the ground, and, while he yet ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her, "Let us immediately fly from this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" ſaid he; "a carriage waits to receive us; it ſhall go wherever you direct, and convey you to your friends." This laſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence touched her heart: "Alas, I have no friends!" ſaid ſhe, "nor do I know whither to go." Theodore gently preſſed her hand between his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, in a voice of the ſofteſt compaſſion, ſaid, "<hi>My</hi> friends then ſhall be yours; ſuffer me to lead you to them. But I am in agony while you remain in this place; let us haſten to quit it." Adeline was going to reply, when voices were heard among the trees, and Theodore ſupporting her with his arm, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>urried her along the avenue: they continued their flight till Adeline, panting for breath, could go no farther.</p>
                     <p>Having pauſed a while, and heard no footſteps in purſuit, they renewed their courſe: Theodore knew that they were now not fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He, however, concealed his apprehenſions from Adeline, and endeavoured to ſooth and ſupport her ſpirits.</p>
                     <p>At length they reached the wall, and Theodore was leading her towards a low part of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He held the ladder while ſhe aſcended; the top of the wall was broad and level<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Adeline having reached it, remained there till Theodore followed and drew the ladder to the other ſide.</p>
                     <p>When they had deſcended, the carriage appeared in waiting, but without the driver. Theodore feared to call, left his voice ſhould betray him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he, therefore, put Adeline into the carriage, and went himſelf in ſearch of the poſtillion, whom he found aſleep under a tree <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Adeline did not yet dare to believe herſelf ſafe, but after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding a conſiderable time without interruption, joy burſt upon her heart, and ſhe thanked her deliverer in terms of the warmeſt gratitude. The ſympathy expreſſed in the tone of his voice and manner, proved that his happineſs, on this occaſion, almoſt equalled her own.</p>
                     <p>As reflection gradually ſtole upon her mind, anxiety ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded joy; in the tumult of the late moments, ſhe thought only of eſcape, but the circumſtances of her preſent ſituation now appeared to her, and ſhe became ſilent and penſive: ſhe had no friends to whom ſhe could fly, and was going with a young Chevalier, almoſt a ſtranger to her, ſhe knew not whither. She remembered how often ſhe had been deceived and betrayed where ſhe truſted moſt, and her ſpirits ſunk: ſhe remembered alſo the former attention which Theodore had ſhewn her, and dreaded leſt his conduct might be prompted by a ſelfiſh paſſion. She ſaw this to be poſſible, but ſhe diſdained to believe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and felt, that nothing could give her greater pain than to doubt the integrity of Theodore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>He interrupted her reverie, by recu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ring to her late ſituation at the abbey. "You would be much ſurpriſed," ſaid he, "and I fear, offended, that I did not attend my appointment at the abbey, after the alarming hints I had given you in our laſt interview. That circumſtance has, perhaps, injured me in your eſteem, if, indeed, I was ever ſo happy as to poſſeſs it: but my deſigns were over-ruled by thoſe of the Marquis de Montalt; and I think I may venture to aſſert, that my diſtreſs upon this occaſion was, at leaſt, equal to your apprehenſions."</p>
                     <p>Adeline ſaid, "She had been much alarmed by the hints he had given her, and by his failing to afford farther information, concerning the ſubject of her danger; and" —She checked the ſentence that hung upon her lips, for ſhe perceived that ſhe was unwarily betraying the intereſt he held in her heart. There were a few moments of ſilence, and neither party ſeemed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at eaſe. Theodore at length, renewed the converſation: "Suffer me to acquaint you," ſaid he, "with the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that withheld me from the interview I ſolicited; I am anxious to exculpate myſelf." Without waiting her reply, he proceeded to inform her, that the Marquis had by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable means, learned or ſuſpected the ſubject of their laſt converſation, and perceiving his deſigns were in danger of being counteracted, had taken effectual means to prevent her obtaining farther intelligence of them. Adeline immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029379_0078_0FE08BF2B25A4DF8"/>
that Theodore and herſelf had been ſeen in the foreſt by La Motte, who had, no doubt, ſuſpected their growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy, and had taken care to inform the Marquis how likely he was to find a rival in his friend.</p>
                     <p>"On the day following that, on which I laſt ſaw you," ſaid Theodore, "the Marquis, who is my colonel, commanded me to prepare to attend in my regiment, and appointed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning for my journey. This ſudden order gave me ſome ſurpriſe, but I was not long in doubt concerning the motive for it; a ſervant of the Marquis, who had been long attached to me, entered my room ſoon after I had left his Lord, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing concern at my abrupt departure, dropped ſome hints reſpecting it, which excited my ſurpriſe. I inquired farther, and was confirmed in the ſuſpicions I had for ſome time enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Marquis's deſigns upon you.</p>
                     <p>"Jacques farther informed me, that our late interview had been noticed and communicated to the Marquis. His informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been obtained from a fellow ſervant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it alarmed me ſo much, that I engaged him to ſend me intelligence from time to time concerning the proceedings of the Marquis. I now looked forward to the evening which would bring me again to your preſence with increaſed impatience: but the ingenuity of the Marquis effectually counteracted my endeavours and wiſhes: he had made an engagement to paſs the day at the villa of a nobleman ſome leagues diſtant, and notwithſtanding all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes I could offer, I was obliged to attend him. Thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to obey, I paſſed a day of more agitation and anxiety than I had ever before experienced. It was midnight before we returned to the Marquis's chateau. I aroſe early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to commence my journey, and reſolved to ſeek an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view with you before I left the province.</p>
                     <p>"When I entered the breakfaſt room, I was mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus unexpectedly deprived of my laſt hope, my countenance, I believe expreſſed what I felt, for the ſcrutin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing eye of the Marquis inſtantly changed from ſeeming careleſſneſs to diſpleaſure. The diſtance from Chineau to the abbey was at leaſt twelve leagues; yet I had once ſome inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of returning from thence, when the Marquis ſhould leave me, till I recollected the very remote chance there would even then be of ſeeing you alone, and alſo, that if I was obſerved b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

La Motte, it would awaken all his ſuſpicions, and caution him againſt any future plan I might ſee it expedient to attempt: I therefore, proceeded to join my regiment.</p>
                     <p>"Jacques ſent me frequent accounts of the operations of the Marquis, but his manner of relating them was ſo very confuſed, that they only ſerved to perplex and diſtreſs me. His laſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, however alarmed me ſo much, that my reſidence in quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters became intolerable; and as I found it impoſſible to obtain leave of abſence, I ſecretly left the regiment, and concealed myſelf in a cottage about a mile from the chateau, that I might obtain the earlieſt intelligence of the Marquis's plans. Jacques brought me daily information, and, at laſt, an account of the horrible plot which was laid for the following night.</p>
                     <p>"I ſaw little probability of warning you of your danger. If I ventured near the abbey, La Motte might diſcover me, and fruſtrate every attempt on my part to ſave you: yet I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to encounter this riſk for the chance of ſeeing you, and towards evening I was preparing to ſet out for the foreſt, when Jacques arrived and informed me, that you was to be brought to the chateau. My plan was thus rendered leſs difficult. I learned alſo, that the Marquis, by means of thoſe refinements in luxury, with which he is but too well acquainted, deſigned now that his apprehenſion of loſing you was no more, to ſeduce you to his wiſhes, and impoſe upon you by a fictitious marriage. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained information concerning the ſituation of the room allotted you, I ordered a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>haiſe to be in waiting, and with a deſign of ſcaling your window, and conducting you thence, I entered the garden at midnight."</p>
                     <p>Theodore having ceaſed to ſpeak, "I know not how words can expreſs my ſenſe of the obligations I owe you," ſaid Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, "or my gratitude for your generoſity."</p>
                     <p>"Ah! call it not generoſity," he replied, "it was love." He pauſed. Adeline was ſilent. After ſome moments of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive emotion, he reſumed; "But pardon this abrupt declaration; yet why do I call it abrupt, ſince my actions have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed what my lips have never, till this inſtant, ventured to acknowledge." He pauſed again, Adeline was ſtill ſilent. Yet do me the juſtice to believe, that I am ſenſible of the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of pleading my love at preſent, and have been ſurpriſed into this confeſſion. I promiſe alſo to forbear from a renewal of the ſubject, till you are placed in a ſituation, where you may
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:029379_0079_0FE08C0064018F50"/>
freely accept or refuſe, the ſincere regards I offer you. If I could, however, now be certain that I poſſeſs your eſteem, it would relieve me from much anxiety."</p>
                     <p>Adeline felt ſurpriſed that he ſhould doubt her eſteem for him, after the ſignal and generous ſervice he had rendered her; but ſhe was not yet acquainted with the timidity of love. "Do you then," ſaid ſhe in a tremulous voice, "believe me ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? It is impoſſible I can conſider your friendly interferrence in my behalf without eſteeming you." Theodore immediately took her hand and preſſed it to his lips in ſilence. They were both too much agitated to converſe and continued to travel for ſome miles without exchanging a word.</p>

                     <p>THE dawn of morning now trembled through the clouds, when the travellers ſtopped at a ſmall town to change horſes.

                     <p>Never till the preſent hour, had he ventured to believe ſhe was in ſafety. Now the diſtance they had gained from the chateau, without perceiving any purſuit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It was impoſſible he could ſit by the ſide of his beloved Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and receive aſſurances of her gratitude and eſteem, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out venturing to hope for her love. He congratulated himſelf as her preſerver, and anticipated ſcenes of happineſs when ſhe ſhould be under the protection of his family. The clouds of miſery and apprehenſion diſappeared from his mind, and left it to the ſunſhine of joy. When a ſhadow of fear would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times return, or when he recollected, with compunction, the circumſtances under which he had left his regiment, ſtationed as it was, upon the frontiers, and in a time of war, he looked at Adeline, and her countenance, with inſtantaneous magic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beamed peace upon his heart.</p>
                     <p>But Adeline had a ſubject of anxiety from which Theodore was exempt; the proſpect of her future days was involved in darkneſs and uncertainty. Again ſhe was going to claim th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to the difficulty of earning a precarious livelihood. Theſe anticipations obſcured the joy occaſioned by her eſcape, and by the affection which the conduct and avowal of Theodore had exhibited. The delicacy of his behaviour, in forbearing to take advantage of her preſent ſituation to plead his love, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed her eſteem, and flattered her pride.</p>
                     <p>Adeline was loſt in meditation upon ſubjects like theſe, when the poſtillion ſtopped the carriage; and pointing to part of a road, which wound down the ſide of a hill they had paſſed, ſaid there were ſeveral horſemen in purſuit! Theodore immediately ordered him to proceed with all poſſible ſpeed, and to ſtrike out of the great road into the firſt obſcure way that offered. The poſtillion cracked his whip in the air, and ſet off as if he was flying for life. In the mean while Theodore endeavoured to re-animate Adeline, who was ſinking with terror, and who now thought, if ſhe could only eſcape from the Marquis, ſhe could defy the future.</p>
                     <p>Preſently they ſtruck in a bye lane, ſcreened and overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thick trees; Theodore again looked from the window, but the cloſing boughs prevented his ſeeing far enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether the purſuit continued. For his ſake Adeline endeavoured to diſguiſe her emotions. "This lane," ſaid Theodore, "will certainly lead to a town or village, and then we have nothing to apprehend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <p>Adeline appeared to be comforted by the hope this reflection ſuggeſted, and Theodore again looked back, but the winding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of the road cloſed his view, and the rattling of the wheels over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came every other ſound. At length he called to the poſtillion to ſtop, and having liſtened attentively, without perceiving any ſound of horſes, he began to hope they were now in ſafety. "Do you know where this road leads?" ſaid he. The poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion anſwered that he did not, but he ſaw ſome houſes through the trees at a diſtance, and believed it led to them. This was moſt welcome intelligence to Theodore who looked forward and perceived the houſes. The poſtillion ſet off, "Fear nothing, my adored Adeline," ſaid he, "you are now ſafe; I will part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ith you but with life." Adeline ſighed, not for herſelf only, but for the danger to which Theodore might be expoſed.</p>
                     <p>They had continued to travel in this manner for near half an hour, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

at an inn, the beſt the place afforded. As Theodore lifted Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line from the chaiſe, he again entreated her to diſmiſs her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and ſpoke with a tenderneſs, to which ſhe could reply only by a ſmile that ill concealed her anxiety. After or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering refreſhments, he went out to ſpeak with the landlord, but had ſcarcely left the room, when Adeline obſerved a party of horſemen enter the inn yard, and ſhe had no doubt theſe were the perſons from whom they fled. The faces of two of them only were turned towards her, but ſhe thought the figure of one of the others not unlike that of the Marquis.</p>
                     <p>Her heart was chilled, and for ſome moments the powers of reaſon forſook her. Her firſt deſign was to ſeek concealment; but while ſhe conſidered the means, one of the horſemen looked up to the window near which ſhe ſtood, and ſpeaking to his companions, they entered the inn. To quit the room without being obſerved was impoſſible; to remain there alone and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>protected as ſhe was, would almoſt be equally dangerous. She paced the room in an agony of terror, often ſecretly calling on Theodore, and often wondering he did not return. Theſe were moments of indeſcribable ſuffering. A loud and tumultuous ſound of voices now aroſe from a diſtant part of the houſe, and ſhe ſoon diſtinguiſhed the words of the diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The next minute Adeline heard the voice of Theodore in reply. "I do not mean to diſpute the King's orders," ſaid he, "and give you my word of honour not to go without you; but firſt unhand me, that I may return to that room; I have a friend there whom I wiſh to ſpeak with." To this propoſal they at firſt objected, conſidering it merely as an excuſe to obtain an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of eſcaping; but after much altercation and entreaty, his requeſt was granted. He ſprang forwards towards the room were Adeline remained, and while a ſerjeant and corporal fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to the door, the two ſoldiers went out into the yard of the inn, to watch the windows of the apartment.</p>
                     <p>With an eager hand he uncloſed the door, but Adeline haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened not to meet him, for ſhe had fainted almoſt at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the diſpute. Theodore called loudly for aſſiſtance, and the miſtreſs of the inn ſoon appeared with her ſtock of remedies, which were adminiſtered in vain to Adeline, who remained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, and by breathing alone gave ſigns of her exiſtence. The diſtreſs of Theodore was in the mean time heightened by the appearance of the officers, who, laughing at the diſcovery of his
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029379_0083_0FE08C21E2A742F8"/>
pretended friend, declared they could wait no longer. Saying this, they would have forced him from the inanimate form of Adeline, over whom he hung in unutterable anguiſh, when fiercely turning upon them, he drew his ſword and ſwore no power on earth ſhould force him away before the lady recovered.</p>
                     <p>The men, enraged by the action and the determined air of Theodore, exclaimed, "Do you oppoſe the King's orders?" and advanced to ſeize him, but he preſented the point of his ſword, and bid them at their peril approach. One of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately drew, Theodore kept his guard, but did not advance. "I demand only to wait here, till the lady recovers," ſaid he; "you underſtand the alternative." The man, already exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the oppoſition of Theodore, regarded the latter part of his ſpeech as a threat, and became determined not to give up the point; he preſſed forward, and while his comrade called the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> from the yard, Theodore wounded him ſlightly in the ſhoulder and received himſelf the ſtroke of a ſabre on his head.</p>
                     <p>The blood guſhed furiouſly from the wound; Theodore, ſtaggering to a chair, ſunk into it, juſt as the remainder of the party entered the room, and Adeline uncloſed her eyes to ſee him ghaſtly pale, and covered with blood. She uttered an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary ſcream, and exclaiming, "they have murdered him," nearly relapſed. At the ſound of her voice he raiſed his head, and ſmiling, held out his hand, to her. "I am not much hurt" ſaid he, faintly, "and ſhall ſoon be better, if indeed you are recovered." She haſtened towards him and gave her hand. "Is nobody gone for a ſurgeon?" ſaid ſhe, with a look of agony. "Do not be alarmed," ſaid Theodore, "I am not ſo ill as you imagine." The room was now crowded with people, whom the report of the affray had brought together; among theſe was a man, who acted as phyſician, apothecary, and ſurgeon to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and who now ſtepped forward to the aſſiſtance of Theodore.</p>
                     <p>Having examined the wound, he declined giving his opinion, but ordered the patient to be immediately put to bed, to which the officers objected, alleging that it was their duty to carry him to the regiment. "That cannot be done without great danger to his life," replied the doctor; "and"—"Oh! his life," ſaid the ſerjeant; "we have nothing to do with that, we muſt do our duty. Adeline, who had hitherto ſtood in trembling an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety, could now no longer be ſilent. "Since the ſurgeon," ſaid ſhe, "has declared in his opinion, that this gentleman can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed in his preſent condition, without endangering his life, you will remember, that if he dies, yours will probably anſwer it."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="unknown:029379_0084_0FE08C27D57A90D0"/>"Yes," rejoined the ſurgeon, who was unwilling to relinquiſh his patient, "I declare before theſe witneſſes, that he cannot be removed with ſafety: you will do well, therefore, to conſider the conſequences. He has received a very dangerous wound, which requires the moſt careful treatment, and the event is even then doubtful; but if he travels, a fever may enſue, and the wound will then be mortal." Theodore heard this ſentence with compoſure, but Adeline could with difficulty conceal the anguiſh of her heart: ſhe rouſed all her fortitude to ſuppreſs the tears that ſtruggled in her eyes; and though ſhe wiſhed to intereſt the humanity, or to awaken the fears of the men, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of their unfortunate priſoner, ſhe dared not to truſt her voice with utterance.</p>
                     <p>From this internal ſtruggle ſhe was relieved by the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the people who filled the room, and becoming clamorous in the cauſe of Theodore, declared the officers would be guilty of murder if they removed him. "Why he muſt die at any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ate," ſaid the ſerjeant, "for quitting his poſt, and drawing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me in the execution of the King's orders." A faint ſickneſs ſeized the heart of Adeline, and ſhe leaned for ſupport againſt Theodore's chair, whoſe concern for himſelf was for a while ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in his anxiety for her. He ſupported her with his arms, and forcing a ſmile, ſaid in a low voice, which ſhe only could hear, "This is a miſrepreſentation; I doubt not, when the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair is inquired into, it will be ſettled without any ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences."</p>
                     <p>Adeline knew theſe words were uttered only to conſole her, and therefore did not give much credit to them, though The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore continued to give her ſimilar aſſurances of his ſafety. Mean while the mob, whoſe compaſſion for him had been gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally excited by the obduracy of the officer, were now rouſed to pity and indignation, by the ſeeming certainty of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the unfeeling manner in which it had been denounced. In a ſhort time they became ſo much enraged, that, partly from a dread of farther conſequences, and partly from the ſhame which their charges of cruelty occaſioned, the ſerjeant conſented that he ſhould he put to bed, till his commanding officer might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect what was to be done. Adeline's joy at this circumſtance overcame for a moment the ſenſe of her misfortunes, and of her ſituation.</p>
                     <p>She waited in an adjoining room the ſentence of the ſurgeon, who was now engaged in examining the wound; and though the accident would in any other circumſtances have ſeverely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

her, ſhe now lamented it the more, becauſe ſhe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf as the cauſe of it, and becauſe the misfortune, by illuſtrating more fully the affection of her lover, drew him cloſer to her heart, and ſeemed, therefore, to ſharpen the poignancy of her affliction. The dreadful aſſertion that Theodore, ſhould he recover, would be puniſhed with death, ſhe ſcarcely dared to conſider, but endeavoured to believe that it was no more than a cruel exaggeration of his antagoniſt.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole Theodore's preſent danger, together with the attendant circumſtances, awakened all her tenderneſs, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to her the true ſtate of her affections. The graceful form, the noble, intelligent countenance, and the engaging manners which ſhe had at firſt admired in Theodore, became afterwards more intereſting by that ſtrength of thought, and elegance of ſentiment, exhibited in his converſation. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſince her eſcape, had excited her warmeſt gratitude, and the danger which he had now encountered in her behalf, called forth her tenderneſs, and heightened it into love. The veil was removed from her heart, and ſhe ſaw for the firſt time, its gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine emotions.</p>

"You are a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the gentleman's, I preſume, Madam; his ſiſter, perhaps." The queſtion vexed and embarraſſed her, and without anſwering it, ſhe repeated her inquiry. Perhaps, Madam, you are more nearly related," purſued the ſurgeon, ſeeming alſo to diſregard her queſtion, "perhaps you are his wife." Adeline bluſhed, and was about to reply, but he continued his ſpeech. "The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt you take in his welfare is, at leaſt, very flattering, and I would almoſt conſent to exchange conditions with him, were I ſure of receiving ſuch tender compaſſion from ſo charming a lady." Saying this, he bowed to the ground.

                     <p>"That, Madam, is, perhaps, a queſtion very difficult to be reſolved; and it is likewiſe a very diſagreeable office to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ill news—I fear he will die." The ſurgeon opened his ſnuff-box and preſented it to Adeline. "Die!" ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"In danger, Madam," exclaimed the ſurgeon, "in danger, yes, certainly, in very great danger." Saying this, he walked away with an air of chagrin and diſpleaſure. Adeline remained for ſome moments in the room, in an acceſs of ſorrow, which ſhe found it impoſſible to reſtrain, and then drying her tears, and endeavouring to compoſe her countenance, ſhe went to inquire for the miſtreſs of the inn, to whom ſhe ſent a waiter. After expecting her in vain for ſome time ſhe rang the bell, and ſent another meſſage ſomewhat more preſſing. Still the hoſteſs did not appear, and Adeline, at length, went herſelf down ſtairs, where ſhe found her, ſurrounded by a number of people relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a loud voice and various geſticulations, the particulars <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

but there's very bad encouragement for his trade, and I believe he's poor enough himſelf. One of the ſort's quite enough for us." Adeline interrupted her to aſk ſome queſtions concerning Theodore, whom the hoſteſs had attended to his chamber. She inquired how he had borne the dreſſing of the wound, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he appeared to be eaſier after the operation; queſtions to which the hoſteſs gave no very ſatisfactory anſwers. She now inquired whether there was any ſurgeon in the neighbourhood of the town, and was told there was not.</p>
                     <p>The diſtreſs viſible in Adeline's countenance ſeemed to excite the compaſſion of the landlady, who now endeavouerd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole her in the beſt manner ſhe was able. She adviſed her to ſend for her friends, and offered to procure a meſſenger. Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſighed and ſaid it was unneceſſary. "I don't know, Ma'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amſelle, what you may think neceſſary," continued the hoſteſs, "but I know I ſhould think it very hard to die in a ſtrange place with no relations near me, and I dare ſay the poor gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thinks ſo himſelf; and, beſides, who is to pay for his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral if he dies!" Adeline begged ſhe would be ſilent, and, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that every proper attention might be given, ſhe promiſed her a reward for her trouble, and requeſted pen and ink imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. "Ay, to be ſure, Ma'amſelle, that is the proper way! why your friends would never forgive you if you did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them; I know it by myſelf. And as for taking care of him, he ſhall have every thing the houſe affords, and I warrant there is never a better inn in the province, though the town is none of the biggeſt." Adeline was obliged to repeat her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt for pen and ink, before the loquacious hoſteſs would quit the room.</p>
                     <p>The thought of ſending for Theodore's friends had, in the tumult of the late ſcenes, never occurred to her, and ſhe was now ſomewhat conſoled by the proſpect of comfort which it opened for him. When the pen and ink were brought, ſhe wrote the following note to Theodore.</p>
                     <p>"In your preſent condition, you have need of every comfort that can be procured you, and ſurely there is no cordial more valuable in illneſs, than the preſence of a friend; ſuffer me, therefore to acquaint your family with your ſituation; it will he a ſatisfaction to me, and I doubt not a conſolation to you."</p>
                     <p>"In a ſhort time after ſhe had ſent the note, ſhe received a meſſage from Theodore, entreating moſt reſpectfully, but earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly, to ſee her for a few minutes. She immediately went to his chamber, and found her worſt appprehenſions confirmed, by

the langour expreſſed in his countenance, while the ſhock ſhe received, together with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"I thank you for this goodneſs," ſaid he, extending his hand which ſhe received, and ſitting down by the bed, burſt into a flood of tears. When her agitation had ſomewhat ſubſided, and, removing her handkerchief from her eyes, ſhe again looked on Theodore, a ſmile of the tendereſt love expreſſed his ſenſe of the intereſt ſhe took in his welfare, and adminiſtered a temporary relief to her heart.</p>
                     <p>"Forgive this weakneſs," ſaid ſhe; "my ſpirits have of late been ſo variouſly agitated" —Theodore interrupted her— "Theſe tears are moſt flattering to my heart. But, for my ſake endeavour to ſupport yourſelf: I doubt not I ſhall ſoon be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the ſurgeon"—</p>
                     <p>"I do not like him," ſaid Adeline, "but tell me how you find yourſelf?" He aſſured her that he was now much eaſier than he had yet been, and mentioning her kind note, he led to the ſubject, on account of which he had ſolicited to ſee her. "My family" ſaid he, "reſide at a great diſtance from hence, and I well know their affection is ſuch, that, were they informed of my ſituation, no conſideration, however reaſonable, could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their coming to my aſſiſtance; but before they can arri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For your ſake Adeline I could wiſh they were here, but a few days will more fully ſhew the conſequences of my wound: let us wait, at leaſt till then, and be directed by circumſtances."</p>
                     <p>Adeline forbore to preſs the ſubject farther, and turned to one more immediately intereſting. "I much wiſh" ſaid ſhe, "that you had a more able ſurgeon; you know the geography of the province better than I do; are we in the neighbourhood of any town likely to afford you other advice?"</p>
                     <p>"I believe not," ſaid he, "and this is an affair of little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, for my wound is ſo inconſiderable, that a very mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate ſhare of ſkill may ſuffice to cure it. But why my beloved Adeline, do you give way to this anxiety? Why ſuffer your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be diſturbed by this tendency to forebode the worſt? I am willing, perhaps preſumptuouſly ſo, to attribute it to your kindneſs, and ſuffer me to aſſure you that, while it excites my gratitude, it increaſes my tendereſt eſteem.

                     <p>When ſupper appeared, ſhe aſked the boy who waited, if he knew a phyſician of the name of Lafance, in the neighbourhood. "Not in the neighbourhood, Madam, but I know Doctor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fance of Chance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the town was at ſome leagues diſtance, and the delay this circumſtance muſt occaſion, again alarmed her; ſhe, however, ordered a meſſenger to be immediately diſpatched, and, having ſent again to inquire concerning Theodore, retired to her chamber for the night.</p>

Adeline, finding that the phyſician was not arrived, immediately aroſe, and haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to inquire farther concerning Theodore. The hoſteſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her, that he had paſſed a very diſturbed night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he had complained of being very hot, and deſired that the fire in his room might be extinguiſhed; but that the nurſe knew her duty too well to obey him, and had ſtrictly followed the doctor's orders.</p>
                     <p>She added, that he had taken the cordial draughts regularly, but had, notwithſtanding, continued to grow worſe, and at laſt became light-headed. In the mean time the boy, who had been ſent for the phyſician, was ſtill abſent: "And no wonder," continued the hoſteſs; "why only conſider, it's eight leagues off, and the lad had to find the road, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

here; and if I might ſpeak my mind, Jacques had better have been ſent off for the young gentleman's friends than for this ſtrange doctor that nobody knows."</p>
                     <p>After aſking ſome farther queſtions concerning Theodore, the anſwers to which rather increaſed than diminiſhed her alarm; Adeline endeavoured to compoſe her ſpirits, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>When the ſurgeon arrived and perceived the ſituation of his patient, he expreſſed no ſurpriſe; but having aſked ſome queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and given a few general directions, he went down to Adeline. After paying her his uſual compliments, he ſuddenly aſſumed an air of importance, "I aim ſorry Madam," ſaid he, "that it is my office to communicate diſagreeable intelligence, but I wiſh you to be prepared for the event, which, I fear, is approaching." Adeline comprehended his meaning and though ſhe had hitherto given little faith to his judgment, ſhe could not hear him hint at the immediate danger of Theodore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out yielding to the influence of fear.</p>
                     <p>She entreated him to acquaint her with all he apprehended; and he then proceeded to ſay, that Theodore was, as he had foreſeen, much worſe this morning than he had been the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night; and the diſorder having now affected his head, there was every reaſon to fear it would prove fatal in a few hours. "The worſt conſequences may enſue," continued he; "if the wound becomes inflamed, there will be very little chance of his recovery."</p>
                     <p>Adeline liſtened to this ſentence with a dreadful ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"The gentleman, I ſuppoſe, Madam, has friends, and the ſooner you inform them of his condition the better.

                     <p>Adeline made an effort to ſpeak, but in vain, and the ſurgeon now called loudly for a glaſs of water; ſhe drank it, and a deep ſigh that ſhe uttered, ſeemed ſomewhat to relieve her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed heart: tears ſucceeded. In the mean time, the ſurgeon perceiving ſhe was better, though not well enough to liſten to his converſation, took his leave, and promiſed to return in an

"The gentleman is ſtill delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous," ſaid he, "but I have ordered him a compoſing draught." "Is there any hope, Sir?" inquired Adeline. "Yes, Madam, certainly there is hope; the caſe at preſent is ſomewhat doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but a few hours may enable me to judge with more certainty. "In the mean time, I have directed that he ſhall be kept quiet, and be allowed to drink freely of ſome diluting liquids."</p>
                     <p>He had ſcarcely, at Adeline's requeſt, recommended a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, inſtead of the one at preſent employed, when the latter gentleman entered the room, and perceiving the phyſician, threw a glance of mingled ſurpriſe and danger at Adeline, who retired with him to another apartment, where ſhe diſmiſſed him with a politeneſs, which he did not deign to return, and which he certainly did not deſerve.</p>
                     <p>Eearly the following morning the ſurgeon arrived, but either the medicines, or the criſis of the diſorder, had thrown Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore into a deep ſleep, in which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ined for ſeveral hours. The phyſician now gave Adeline reaſon to hope for a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble iſſue, and every precaution was taken to prevent his being diſturbed. He awoke perfectly ſenſible and face from fever, and his firſt words inquired for Adeline, who ſoon learned he was out of danger.</p>
                     <p>In a few days he was ſufficiently recovered to be removed from his chamber to a room adjoining, where Adeline <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>After an hour of affecting converſation, in which, the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a young and mutual attachment occupied all their minds, and excluded every, idea not in uniſon with delight, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to a ſenſe of their preſent embarraſſments: Adeline re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that Theodore was arreſted for diſobedience of orders, and deſerting his poſt; and Theodore, that he muſt ſhortly be torn away from Adeline, who would be left expoſed to all the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029379_0089_0FE08C5C119962E8"/>
evils from which he had ſo lately reſcued her. This thought overwhelmed his heart again with anguiſh; and, after a long pauſe he ventured to propoſe, what his wiſhes had often ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, a marriage with Adeline before he departed from the village: this was the only means of preventing, perhaps, an eternal ſeparation; and though he ſaw the many dangerous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences to which ſhe would be expoſed, by a marriage with a man circumſtanced like himſelf, yet thoſe appeared ſo unequal to thoſe ſhe would otherwiſe be left to encounter alone, that his reaſon could no longer ſcruple to adopt what his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection had ſuggeſted.</p>
                     <p>Adeline was, for ſome time, too much agitated to reply; and though ſhe had little to oppoſe to the arguments and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Theodore; though ſhe had no friends to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the evening, one of the officers, who, upon the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſerjeant, was ſent by the perſons employed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute military criminals, arrived at the village, and entering the apartment of Theodore, from which Adeline immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrew, informed him, with an air of infinite importance, that he ſhould ſet out on the following day for head-quarters. Theodore anſwered, that he was not able to bear the journey, and referred him to his phyſician; but the officer, replied that he ſhould take no ſuch trouble, it being certain that the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician might be inſtructed what to ſay, and that he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his journey on the morrow. "Here has been delay enough" ſaid he, "already, and you will have ſufficient buſineſs on your

hands when you reach head quarters; for the ſerjeant whom you have ſeverely wounded, intends to appear againſt you; and this, with the offence you have committed by deſerting your poſt."</p>
                     <p>Theodore's eyes flaſhed fire, "Deſerting!" ſaid he, riſing from his ſeat, and darting a look of menace at his accuſer, "who dares to brand me with the name of deſerter?" But inſtantly recollecting how much his conduct had appeared to juſtify the accuſation, he endeavoured to ſtifle his emotions, and with a firm voice and compoſed manner, ſaid, that when he reached head-quarters, he ſhould be ready to anſwer whatever might be brought againſt him, but that till then he ſhould be ſilent. The boldneſs of the officer was repreſſed by the ſpirit and dignity with which Theodore ſpoke theſe words, and mutter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> reply, that was ſcarcely audible, he left the room.</p>
                     <p>Theodore ſat muſing on the danger of his ſituation: he knew that he had much to apprehend from the peculiar circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces attending his abrupt departure from his regiment, it having been ſtationed in a garriſon town upon the Spaniſh frontiers; where the diſcipline was very ſevere, and from the power of his colonel, the Marquis de Montalt, whom pride and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment would now rouſe to vengeance, and, probably, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indefatigable in the accompliſhment of his deſtruction. But his thoughts ſoon led from his own danger to that of Adeline, and, in the conſideration of this, all his fortitude for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him: he could not ſupport the idea of leaving her expoſed to the evils he forboded, nor indeed, of a ſeparation ſo ſudden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Adeline, when ſhe learned that he was to depart on the morrow, felt as if bereaved of her laſt comfort. All the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his ſituation aroſe to her mind, and ſhe turned from him in unutterable anguiſh. Conſidering her ſilence, as a favourable preſage, he repeated his entreaties that ſhe would conſent to be his, and thus give him a ſurety that their ſeparation ſhould not be eternal. Adeline ſighed deeply to theſe words: And who can know that our ſeparation will <hi>not</hi> be eternal," ſaid ſhe, "even if I could conſent to the marriage you propoſe? But while you hear my determination forbear to accuſe me of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, for indifference towards you would, indeed, be a crime, after the ſervices you have rendered me."</p>
                     <p>"And is a cold ſentiment of gratitude all that I muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from you?" ſaid Theodore, "I know that you are going to diſtreſs me with a proof of your indifference, which you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

If, indeed, you can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, I ſhall do well to forget that I ever made ſuch an acknowledgement, and you, that you heard it."</p>

Adeline, ſmiling faintly through her tears, held out her hand, which he ſeized and preſſed to his lips. "Yet do not drive me to deſpair by a rejection of my ſuit," continued Theodore; "think what I muſt ſuffer to leave you here deſtitute of friends and protection."</p>
                     <p>"I am thinking how I may avoid a ſituation ſo deplorable," ſaid Adeline. "They ſay there is a convent, which recei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"All this I have conſidered," ſaid Adeline, "and am prepared to encounter it, rather than enter into an engagement, which at this time, can be productive only of miſery to us both."</p>

But <hi>you</hi> Adeline, <hi>you</hi> look with complacency upon a circumſtance which tortures <hi>me</hi> with deſpair."</p>
                     <p>Adeline, who had long ſtrove to ſupport her ſpirits in his preſence, while ſhe adhered to a reſolution which reaſon ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, but which the pleadings of her heart powerfully oppoſed, was unable longer to command her diſtreſs, and burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>Theodore was in the ſame moment convinced of his error, and ſhocked at the grief he had occaſioned. He drew his chair

toward her, and taking her hand, again entreated her pardon and endeavoured in the tendereſt accents to ſoothe and comfort her.—"What a wretch was I to cauſe you this diſtreſs, by queſtioning that regard with which I can no longer doubt you honour me! Forgive me, Adeline; ſay but you forgive me, and whatever may be the pain of this ſeparation, I will no longer oppoſe it."</p>
                     <p>"You have given me ſome pain," ſaid Adeline "but you have not offen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theodore endeavoured to conceal the diſtreſs which the approaching ſeparation occaſioned him, and to conſult with her on theſe plans with compoſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His judgment by degrees prevailed over his paſſions, and he now perceived that the plan ſhe ſuggeſted would afford her the beſt chance of ſecurity. He conſidered, what in the firſt agitation of his mind had eſcaped him, that he might be condemned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the charges brought againſt him, and that his death, ſhould they have been married, would not only deprive her of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, but leave her more immediately expoſed to the deſigns of the Marquis, who would doubtleſs, attend his trial. Aſtoniſhed that he had not noticed this before, and ſhocked at the unwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by which he might have betrayed her into ſo dangerous a ſituation, he became at once reconciled to the idea of leaving her in a convent. He could have wiſhed to place her in the aſylum of his own family, but the circumſtances under which ſhe muſt be introduced, were ſo awkward and painful, and above all, the diſtance at which they reſided, would render a journey ſo highly dangerous for her, that he forbore to propoſe it. He entreated only that ſhe would allow him to write to her; but recollecting that his letters might be a means of betraying the place of her reſidence to the Marquis, he checked himſelf: "I muſt deny myſelf even this melancholy pleaſure," ſaid he, "leſt my letters ſhould diſcover your abode; yet how ſhall I be able to endure the impatience and uncertainty to which prudence condems me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you are in danger, I ſhall be ignorant of it; though indeed, did I know it," ſaid he, with a took of deſpair, "I could not fly to ſave you.

                        </gap> all the horrors of confinement—'tis now only that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all the value of liberty!"</p>
                     <p>His utterance was interrupted by the violent agitation of his mind; he aroſe from his chair, and walked with quick paces about the room. Adeline ſat, overcome by the deſcription which Theodore had given of his approaching ſituation, and by
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029379_0091_0FE08C7028A51EF0"/>
the conſideration that ſhe might remain in the moſt terrible ſuſpenſe concerning his fate. She ſaw him in a priſon—pale emaciated, and in chains: ſhe ſaw all the vengeance of the Marquis deſcending upon him; and this for his noble exertions in her cauſe. Theodore, alarmed by the placid deſpair ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in her countenance, threw himſelf into a chair by her's, and taking her hand, attempted to ſpeak comfort to her, but the words faultered on his lips, and he could only bathe her hand with tears.</p>
                     <p>This mournful ſilence was interrupted by the arrival of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage at the inn, and Theodore ariſing, went to the window that opened into the yard. The darkneſs of the night prevented his diſtinguiſhing the objects without, but a light now brought from the houſe ſhewed him a carriage and four, attended by ſeveral ſervants. Preſently he ſaw a gentleman, wrapped up in a roquelaure, alight and enter the inn, and in the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he heard the voice of the Marquis.</p>
                     <p>He had flown to ſupport Adeline, who was ſinking with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, when the door opened, and the Marquis, followed by the officers and ſeveral ſervants, entered. Fury flaſhed from his eyes as they glanced upon Theodore, who hung over Adeline with a look of fearful ſolicitude—"Seize that traitor," ſaid he, turning to the officers; "why have you ſuffered him to remain here ſo long?" "I am no traitor'" ſaid Theodore, with a firm voice, and the dignity of conſcious worth, "but a defender of innocence, of one whom the treacherous Marquis de Montalt would deſtroy."</p>
                     <p>"Obey your orders," ſaid the Marquis to the officers. Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſhrieked, held faſter by Theodore's arm, and entreated the men not to part them. "Force only can effect it," ſaid Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, as he looked round for ſome inſtrument of defence, but he could ſee none, and in the ſame moment they ſurrounded and ſeized him. "Dread every thing from my vengeance," ſaid the Marquis to Theodore, as he caught the hand of Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, who had loſt all power of reſiſtance, and was ſcarcely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of what paſſed; "dread every thing from my vengeance; you know you have deſerved it."</p>
                     <p>"I defy your vengeance," cried Theodore, "and dread only the pangs of conſcience, which your power cannot inflict upon m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:029379_0092_0FE08C7517EE1558"/>A confuſed uproar of voices now ſounded from below, and the ſcreams of women convinced her there was fighting; ſhe even thought ſhe heard the claſhing of ſwords; the image of Theodore, dying by the hands of the Marquis, now roſe to her imagination, and the terrors of ſuſpenſe became almoſt inſupportable. She made a deſperate effort to force the door, and again called for help, but her trembling hands were powerleſs, and every perſon in the houſe ſeemed to be too much engaged even to hear her. A loud ſhriek now pierced her ears, and amidſt the tumult that followed, ſhe clearly diſtinguiſhed deep groans. This confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of her fears deprived her of all her remaining ſpirits, and growing faint, ſhe ſunk almoſt lifeleſs into a chair near the door. The uproar gradually ſubſided till all was ſtill, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body returned to her. Soon after ſhe heard voices in the yard, but ſhe had no power to walk acroſs the room, even to aſk the queſtion ſhe wiſhed, yet feared to have anſwered.</p>
                     <p>About a quarter of an hour elapſed, when the door was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked, and the hoſteſs appeared with a countenance as pale as death. "For God's ſake," ſaid Adeline, "tell me what has happened? Is he wounded? is he killed?"</p>
                     <p>"He is not dead, Ma'amſelle, but—He is dying then?—tell me where he is—let me go."</p>
                     <p>"Stop Ma'amſelle," cried the hoſteſs, you are to ſtay here, I only want the hartſhorn out of that cupboard there." Adeline tried to eſcape by the door, but the hoſteſs puſhing her aſide, locked it, and went down ſtairs.</p>
                     <p>Adeline's diſtreſs now entirely overcame her, and ſhe ſat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs, and ſcarcely conſcious that ſhe exiſted, till rouſed by a ſound of footſteps near the door, which was again opened and three men, whom ſhe knew to be the Marquis's ſervants, entered. She had ſufficient recollection to repeat the queſtions ſhe had aſked the landlady, but they anſwered only that ſhe muſt come with them, and that a chaiſe was waiting for her at the door. Still ſhe urged her queſtions. "Tell me if he lives" cried ſhe — "Yes Ma'amſelle he is alive, but he is terribly wounded, and the ſurgeon is juſt come, to him." As they ſpoke they hurried her along the paſſage, and without noticing her entreaties and ſupplications, to know whether ſhe was going, they had reached the foot of the ſtairs, when her cries brought ſeveral people to the door. To theſe the hoſteſs related, that the lady was the wife of a gentleman juſt arrived, who had overtaken her in her flight with a gallant; an account which the Marquis's ſervants
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:029379_0093_0FE08C82A88E5EB8"/>
corroborated. "'Tis the gentleman who has juſt fought the duel," added the hoſteſs, "and it was on her account."</p>
                     <p>Adeline, partly diſdaining to take any notice of this artful ſtory, and partly from her deſire to know the particulars of what had happened, contented herſelf with repeating her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries; to which one of the ſpectators at laſt replied, that the gentlman was deſperately wounded. The Marquis's people would now have hurried her into the chaiſe, but ſhe ſunk life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in their arms, and her condition ſo intereſted the humanity of the ſpectators, that, notwithſtanding their belief of what had been ſaid, they oppoſed the effort made to carry her, ſenſeleſs as ſhe was, into the carriage.</p>
                     <p>She was at length taken into a room, and by proper applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reſtored to her ſenſes. There ſhe ſo earneſtly beſought an explanation of what had happened, the hoſteſs acquainted her with ſome particulars of the late recounter. When the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was ill heard your ſcreams, Madam," ſaid ſhe, "he became quite outrageous, as they tell me, and nothing could pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify him. The Marquis, for they ſay he is a Marquis but you know beſt, was then in the room with my huſband, and I, and when he heard the uproar, he went down to ſee what was the matter; and when he came into the room where the Captain was, he found him ſtruggling with the ſerjeant. Then the Captain was more outrageous than ever, and notwithſtanding he had one leg chained, and no ſword, he contrived to get the ſerjeants's cutlaſs out of the ſcabbard, and immediately flew at the Marquis, and wounded him deſperately; upon which he was ſecured."— "It is the Marquis then who is wounded," ſaid Adeline; "the other gentleman is not hurt."</p>
                     <p>"No, not he," replied the hoſteſs; "but he will ſmart for it by the bye, for the Marquis ſwears he will do for him." Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, for a moment, forgot all her misfortunes and all her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in thankfulneſs for the immediate eſcape of Theodore; and ſhe was proceeding to make ſome farther inquires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, when the Marquis's ſervants entered the room, and declared they could wait no longer. Adeline, now awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to a ſenſe of the evils with which ſhe was threatened, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to win the pity of the hoſteſs, who, however, was, or affected to be, convinced of the truth of the Marquis's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ory, and therefore, inſenſible to all ſhe could urge. Again ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed his ſervants, but in vain; they would neither ſuffer her to remain longer at the inn, or inform her whither ſhe was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but in the preſence of ſeveral perſons, already prejudiced by the injurious aſſertions of the hoſteſs, Adeline was hurri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus ended Adeline's ſhare of an adventure, begun with a proſpect not only of ſecurity, but of happineſs; an adventure, which had attached her more cloſely to Theodore, and ſhewn him to be more worthy of her love; but which, at the ſame time, had diſtreſſed her by new diſappointment, produced the impriſonment of her generous and now-adored lover, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered both himſelf and her into the power of a rival, irritated by delay, contempt, and oppoſition.</p>

                     <p>THE ſurgeon of the place having examined the Marquis's wound, gave him an immediate opinion upon it, and ordered that he ſhould be put to bed: but the Marquis, ill as he was, had ſcarcely any other apprehenſion than that of loſing Adeline, and declared he ſhould be able to begin his journey in a few hours. With this intention, he had began to give orders for keeping horſes in readineſs, when the ſurgeon perſiſting moſt ſeriouſly, and even paſſionately to exclaim, that his life would be the ſacrifice of his raſhneſs, he was carried to a bed chamber, where his valet alone was permitted to attend him.</p>
                     <p>This man, the convenient confidant of all his intrigues, had been the chief inſtrument in aſſiſting his deſigns concerning Adeline, and was indeed the very perſon who had brought her to the Marquis's villa on the borders of the foreſt. To him the Marquis gave his farther directions concerning her; and, foreſeeing the inconvenience, as well as the danger of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her at the inn, he had ordered him, with ſeveral other ſervants, to carry her away immediately in a hired carriage. The valet having gone to execute his orders, the Marquis was left to his own reflections, and to the violence of contending paſſions.</p>
                     <p>The reproaches and continued oppoſition of Theodore, the favoured lover of Adeline, exaſperated his pride, and rouſed
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:029379_0094_0FE08C8761451AE8"/>
all his malice. He could not for a moment conſider this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which was in ſome reſpects ſucceſsful, without feeling an exceſs of indignation and inveteracy, ſuch as the proſpect of a ſpeedy revenge could alone enable him to ſupport.</p>
                     <p>When he had diſcovered Adeline's eſcape from the villa, his ſurpriſe at firſt equalled his diſappointment; and, after exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the paroxyſms of his rage upon his domeſtics, he diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all different ways in purſuit of her, going himſelf to the abbey, in the faint hope, that, deſtitute as ſhe was of other ſuccour, ſhe might have fled thither. La Motte, however, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much ſurpriſed as himſelf, and as ignorant of the route which Adeline had taken, he returned to the villa impatient of intelligence, and found ſome of his ſervants arrived, without any news of Adeline, and thoſe who came afterwards were as ſucceſsleſs as the firſt.</p>
                     <p>A few days after, a letter from the Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment informed him, that Theodore had quittted his company, and had been for ſome time abſent, nobody knew where. This information, confirming a ſuſpicion which had frequently occurred to him, that Theodore had been by ſome means or other, inſtrumental in the eſcape of Adeline, all his other paſſions became for a time ſubſervient to his revenge, and he gave orders for the immediate purſuit and apprehenſion of Theodore: but Theodore, in the mean time, had been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and ſecured.</p>
                     <p>It was in conſequence of having formerly obſerved the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partiality between him and Adeline, and of intelligence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from La Motte, who had noticed their interview in the foreſt, that the Marquis had reſolved to remove a rival ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to his love, and ſo likely to be informed of his deſigns. He had therefore told Theodore, in a manner as plauſible as he could, that it would be neceſſary for him to join the regiment; a notice which affected him only as it related to Adeline, and which ſeemed the leſs extraordinary, as he had already been at the villa a much longer time than was uſual with the officers invited by the Marquis: Theodore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, very well knew the character of the Marquis, and had accepted his invitation rather from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>From the men who had apprehended Theodore, the Marquis received the information, which had enabled him to purſue and recover Adeline, but, though he had now effected this, he was
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:029379_0094_0FE08C8761451AE8"/>
internally a prey to the corroſive effects of diſappointed paſſion and exaſperated pride. The anguiſh of his wound was almoſt forgotten in that of his mind, and every pang he felt ſeemed to increaſe his thirſt of revenge, and to recoil with new torture upon his heart. While he was in this ſtate, he heard the voice of the innocent Adeline imploring protection; but her cries excited him neither pity nor remorſe; and when, ſoon after, the carriage drove away, and he was certain both that ſhe was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and Theodore was wretched, he ſeemed to feel ſome ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of mental pain.</p>
                     <p>Theodore, indeed, did ſuffer all that a virtuous mind, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under oppreſſion ſo ſevere, could feel; but he was, at leaſt, free from thoſe inveterate and malignant paſſions which tore the boſom of the Marquis, and which inflict upon the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor a puniſhment more ſevere than any they can prompt him to imagine for another. What indignation he might feel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Marquis was at this time ſecondary to his anxiety for Adeline. His captivity was painful, as it prevented his ſeeking a juſt and honourable revenge; but it was dreadful, as it withheld him from attempting the riſque of her whom he loved more than life.</p>
                     <p>When he heard the wheels of the carriage that contained her drive off, he felt an agony of deſpair which almoſt overcame his reaſon. Even the ſtern hearts of the ſoldiers who attended him were not wholly inſenſible to his wretchedneſs, and by venturing to blame the conduct of the Marquis, they endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conſole their priſoner. The phyſician, who was juſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, entered the room during this paroxyſm of his diſtreſs, and both feeling and expreſſing much concern at his condition, inquired with ſtrong ſurpriſe why he had been thus precipitately removed to a room ſo very unfit for his reception?</p>
                     <p>Theodore explained to him the reaſon of this, of the diſtreſs he ſuffered, and of the chains by which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or which purpoſe he deſired the ſoldiers to leave the room. The men, complying with this requeſt, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>He then related all the particulars of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> tranſaction, and of his connection with the Marquis. The phyſician attended to his narrative with deep concern, and his countenance frequently expreſſed ſtrong agitation. When Theodore concluded, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for ſome time ſilent and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

awaking from his reverie, he ſaid, "I fear your ſituation is deſperate. The character of the Marquis is too well known to ſuffer him either to be loved or reſpected; from ſuch a man you have nothing to hope, for he has ſcarcely any thing to fear. I wiſh it was in my power to ſerve you, but I ſee no poſſibility of it."</p>
                     <p>"Alas!" ſaid Theodore, "my ſituation is indeed deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and—for that ſuffering angel"—deep ſobs interrupted his voice, and the violence of his agitation would not allow him to proceed. The phyſician could only expreſs the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy he felt for his diſtreſs, and entreat him to be more calm, when a ſervant entered the room from the Marquis, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee the phyſician immediately. After ſome time he ſaid he would attend the Marquis, and having endeavoured to attain a degree of compoſure, which he found it difficult to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, he wrung the hand of Theodore and quitted the room, promiſing to return before he left the houſe.</p>
                     <p>He found the Marquis much agitated both in body and mind, and rather more apprehenſive for the conſequences of the wound than he had expected. His anxiety for Theodore now ſuggeſted a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>an, by the execution of which he hoped he might be able to ſerve him. Having felt his patient's pulſe, and aſked ſome queſtions, he aſſumed a very ſerious look, when the Marquis, who watched every turn of his countenance, deſired he would, without heſitation, ſpeak his opinion.</p>
                     <p>"I am ſorry to alarm you, my Lord, but here is ſome reaſon for apprehenſion: how long is it ſince you received the wound?"</p>
                     <p>"Good God! there is danger then!" cried the Marquis, adding ſome bitter execrations againſt Theodore.—"There certainly <hi>is</hi> danger;" replied the phyſician, "a few hours may enable me to determine its degree."</p>

                     <p>"You miſtake me, Sir," ſaid the phyſician, "if I believe you a dying man, or, indeed, <hi>very</hi>

                        </gap>ſequence I ſhould know how long the wound has been inflicted." The Marquis's terror now began to ſubſide; and he gave a circumſtantial account of the affray with Theodore, repreſenting that he had been baſely uſed in an affair, where his own conduct had been perfectly juſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:029379_0095_0FE08C955E98D708"/>
and humane. The phyſician heard this relation with great coolneſs, and when it concluded, without making any comment upon it, told the Marquis he would preſcribe a medicine, which he wiſhed him to take immediately.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis, again alarmed by the gravity of his manner, entreated he would declare moſt ſeriouſly, whether he thought him in immediate danger. The phyſician heſitated, and the anxiety of the Marquis increaſed; "It is of conſequence," ſaid he, "that I ſhould know my exact ſituation." The phyſician then ſaid, that if he had any worldly affairs to ſettle, it would be as well to attend to them, for that it was impoſſible to ſay what might be the event.</p>
                     <p>He then turned the diſcourſe and ſaid, he had juſt been with the young officer under arreſt, who, he hoped, would not be removed at preſent, as ſuch a procedure muſt endanger his life. The Marquis uttered a dreadful oath, and, curſing Theodore for having brought him to his preſent condition, ſaid, he ſhould depart with the guard that very night.

having left the room, the phyſician repeated to him ſome part of his converſation with the Marquis. Theodore, after expreſſing his thanks, ſaid, he had nothing more to hope. For himſelf he felt little; it was for his family and for Adeline he ſuffered. He inquired what route ſhe had taken, and though he had no proſpect of deriving advantage from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, he deſired the phyſician to aſſiſt him in obtaining it; but the landlord and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theodore had ſcarcely time to declare his gratitude for the kindneſs of this valuable friend, before the ſoldiers entered the room to conduct him to the carriage in waiting. As he bade him farewell, Theodore ſlipped his purſe into his hand, and turning abruptly away told the ſoldiers to lead on; but the phyſician ſtopped him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>She hinted her ſuſpicions to La Motte, who reproved her for having entertained them, but his manner, inſtead of repreſſing, increaſed her fears for Adeline; fears which, the conduct of the Marquis ſoon confirmed. On the night that he ſlept at the abbey, it had occurred to her, that whatever ſcheme was in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation would now moſt probably be diſcuſſed, and anxiety for Adeline, made her ſtoop to a meanneſs, which, in other circumſtances, would have been deſpicable.

                     <p>At the time when Adeline was planning her eſcape from the abbey, the ſignificant looks of Peter had led La Motte to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the truth, and to obſerve them more cloſely. He had ſeen them ſeparate in the hall in apparent confuſion, and had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obſerved them converſing together in the cloiſters. Circumſtances ſo unuſual left him not a doubt that Adeline had diſcovered her danger, and was concerting with Peter ſome means of eſcape. Affecting, therefore, to be informed of the whole affair, he charged Peter with treachery towards himſelf, and threatened him with the vengeance of the Marquis if he did not diſcloſe all he knew. The menace intimidated Peter, and, ſuppoſing that all chance of aſſiſting Adeline was gone, he made a circumſtantial confeſſion, and promiſed to forbear ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting Adeline with the diſcovery of the ſcheme. In this promiſe he was ſeconded by inclination, for he feared to meet the diſpleaſure, which Adeline believing he had betrayed her, might expreſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="unknown:029379_0099_0FE08CBAE0BB8C10"/>On the evening of the day on which Adeline's intended eſcape was diſcovered, the Marquis deſigned to come to the abbey, and it had been agreed that he ſhould then take Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line to his villa. La Motte had immediately perceived the advantage of permitting Adeline to repair, in the belief of being undiſcovered, to the tomb. It would prevent much diſturbance and oppoſition, and ſpare himſelf the pain he muſt feel in her preſence, when ſhe ſhould know that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed her. A ſervant of the Marquis might go, at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour, to the tomb, and wrapt in the diſguiſe of night, might take her quietly thence in the character of Peter. Thus, without reſiſtance, ſhe would be carried to the villa, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her miſtake till it was too late to prevent its conſequence.</p>
                     <p>When the Marquis did arrive, La Motte, who was not ſo much intoxicated by the wine he had drank, as to forget his prudence, informed him of what had happened and what he had planned, and the Marquis approving it, his ſervant was made acquainted with the ſignal, which afterwards betrayed Adeline to his power.</p>
                     <p>A deep conſciouſneſs of the unworthy neutrality ſhe had obſerved in Adeline's concerns, made Madame La Motte an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiouſly avoid ſeeing her now that ſhe was again in the abbey. Adeline underſtood this conduct, and ſhe rejoiced that ſhe was ſpared the anguiſh of meeting her as an enemy, whom ſhe had once conſidered as a friend. Several days now paſſed in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in miſerable retroſpection, and dreadful expectation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The perilous ſituation of Theodore was almoſt the conſtant ſubject of her thoughts. Often did ſhe breathe an agonizing wiſh for his ſafety, and often look round the ſphere of poſſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in ſearch of hope: but hope had almoſt left the horizon of her proſpect, and when it did appear, it ſprung only from the death of the Marquis, whoſe vengeance threatened moſt certain deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>The Marquis, mean while, lay at the inn at Baux, in a ſtate of very doubtful recovery. The phyſician and ſurgeon, neither of whom he would diſmiſs, nor ſuffer to leave the village, proceeded upon contrary principles, and the good effect of what the one preſcribed, was frequently counteracted by the injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious treatment of the other. Humanity alone prevailed on the phyſician to continue his attendance. The malady of the Marquis was alſo heightened by the impatience of his temper, and terrors of death, and the irritation of his paſſions. One moment he believed himſelf dying, another he could ſcarcely
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029379_0100_0FE08CC083F1EB10"/>
be prevented from attempting to follow Adeline to the abbey. So various were the fluctuations of his mind, and ſo rapid the ſchemes that ſucceeded each other, that his paſſions were in a continual ſtate of conflict. The phyſician attempted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him, that his recovery greatly depended upon tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and to prevail upon him to attempt, at leaſt, ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his feelings, but he was ſoon ſilenced, in hopeleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt by the impatient anſwers of the Marquis.</p>
                     <p>At length the ſervant, who had carried off Adeline, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Marquis having ordered him into his chamber, aſked ſo many queſtions in a breath, that the man knew not which to anſwer. At length he pulled a folded paper from his pocket, which he ſaid had been dropped in the chaiſe by Mademoiſelle Adeline, and as he thought his lordſhip would like to ſee it, he had taken care of it. The Marquis ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth his hand with eagerneſs and received a note addreſſed to Theodore.

                     <p>He, however, broke the ſeal, and found it to be a note of inquiry, written by Adeline to Theodore during his illneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which, from ſome accident ſhe had been prevented from ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him.

                     <p>After many days of hopes and fears, the ſtrength of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution overcame his illneſs, and he was well enough to write ſeveral letters, one of which immediately ſent off to prepare La Motte for his reception. The ſame policy, which had prompted him to conceal his illneſs from La Motte, now urged him to ſay, what he knew would not happen, that he ſhould reach the abbey, on the day after his ſervant. He repeated this injunction, that Adeline ſhould be ſtrictly guarded, and renewed his promiſes of reward for the future ſervices of La Motte.</p>

Adeline paſſed theſe days in a ſtate of ſuſpenſe, which was now cheered by hope, and now darkened by deſpair. This delay ſo much exceeding her expectation, ſeemed to prove that the illneſs of the Marquis was dangerous; and when ſhe looked forward to the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of his recovery, ſhe could not be ſorry that it was ſo.

All hope was now, however, gone; he was ſuffering the miſeries of a priſon, and the tortures of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion both for his own life and her ſafety.

                     <p>"I have my Lord, and will quickly decide, when you ſhall farther explain yourſelf. Till then I can form no reſolution." The Marquis appeared diſatisfied, and was a moment ſilent. "Is it

                     <p>"It is, my Lord," ſaid La Motte immediately. "If you fear to conſide in me freely, how can I fully accompliſh your purpoſe?"</p>
                     <p>"Before I proceed farther," ſaid the Marquis, "let me ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter ſome oath which ſhall bind you to ſecrecy. But this is ſcarcely neceſſary; for, could I even doubt your word of honour, the remembrance of a certain tranſaction would point out to you the neceſſity of being as ſilent yourſelf as you muſt wiſh me to be. There was now a pauſe of ſilence, during which both the Marquis and La Motte betrayed ſome confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

                     <p>"True my Lord, I am ever willing to acknowledge this, and am ſorry it has not been in my power to ſerve you more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Your farther views reſpecting her I am ready to aſſiſt."</p>
                     <p>"I thank you—Adeline"—the Marquis heſitated— "Adeline" rejoined La Motte, eager to anticipate his wiſhes, "has beauty worthy of your purſuit. She has inſpired a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which ſhe ought to be proud, and, at any rate, ſhe ſhall ſoon be yours. Her charms are worthy of"—</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes," interrupted the Marquis; but"—he pauſed— "But they have given you too much trouble in the purſuit," ſaid La Motte; "and to be ſure, my Lord, it muſt be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they have; but this trouble is all over—you may now conſider her as your own.</p>
                     <p>"I would do ſo," ſaid the Marquis, fixing an eye of earneſt regard upon La Motte—"I would do ſo."</p>
                     <p>"Name your hour, my Lord; you ſhall not be interrupted.— Beauty ſuch as Adeline's"—</p>
                     <p>"Watch her cloſe" interrupted the Marquis, "and on no account ſuffer her to leave her apartment. Where is ſhe now?"</p>
                     <p>"Confined in her chamber."</p>
                     <p>"Very well. But I am impatient."</p>

                     <p>"Yes, my Lord, this night, if you wiſh it ſo. But had you not better diſmiſs your ſervants, and remain yourſelf in the foreſt. You know the door that opens upon the wood from

                     <p>"Adeline dies!" interrupted the Marquis, in a low voice ſcarcely human. "Do you underſtand me now?"—La Motte ſhrunk aghaſt—"My Lord!"</p>
                     <p>"La Motte" ſaid the Marquis,—There was a ſilence of ſeveral minutes, in which La Motte endeavoured to recover himſelf.—"Let me a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"Make no inquiries for my motive," ſaid the Marquis; but it is as certain as that I live that ſhe you name muſt die. "This is ſufficient." The ſurpriſe of La Motte equalled his horror the means are various," reſumed the Marquis. "I could have wiſhed that no blood might be ſpilt; and there are drugs ſure and ſpeedy in their effect, but they cannot be ſoon or ſafely procured. I alſo wiſh it over—it muſt be done quickly, this night."</p>
                     <p>"This night, my Lord!"</p>
                     <p>"Aye, this night, La Motte; if it is to be, why not ſoon. Have you no convenient drug at hand?"</p>
                     <p>"None, my Lord."</p>
                     <p>"I feared to truſt a third perſon, or I ſhould have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided," ſaid the Marquis. "As it is, take this poignard; uſe it as occaſion offers, but be reſolute." La Motte received the poignard with a trembling hand, and continued to gaze upon it for ſome time, ſcarcely knowing what he did. "Put it up," ſaid the Marquis, "and endeavour to recollect yourſelf." La Motte obeyed, but continued to muſe in ſilence.</p>
                     <p>He ſaw himſelf entangled in the web which his own crimes had woven. Being in the power of the Marquis, he knew he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When he conſidered the innocence, and the helpleſſneſs of Adeline, her orphan ſtate, her former affectionate conduct, and her confidence in his protection, his heart melted with compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the diſtreſs he had already occaſioned her, and ſhrunk in

arrange her thoughts, and to argue herſelf into ſome degree of reſignation; but reflection, by repreſenting the paſt, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by anticipating the future, brought before her mind the full picture of her misfortunes, and ſhe ſunk in deſpondency. Of Theodore, who, by a conduct ſo noble, had teſtified his attachment and involved himſelf in ruin, ſhe thought with a degree of anguiſh infinitely ſuperior to any ſhe had felt upon my other occaſion.</p>
                     <p>That the very exertions which had deſerved all her gratitude, and awakened all her tenderneſs, ſhould be the cauſe of his deſtruction, was a circumſtance ſo much beyond the ordinary bounds of miſery, that her fortitude ſunk at once before it. The idea of Theodore ſuffering—Theodore dying—was for ever preſent to her imagination, and frequently excluding the ſenſe of her own danger, made her conſcious only of his. Sometimes the hope he had given her of being able to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his conduct, or at leaſt to obtain a pardon, would return; but it was like the faint beam of an April morn, tranſient and cheerleſs. She knew that the Marquis, ſtung with jealouſy, and exaſperated to revenge, would purſue him with unrelenting malice.</p>
                     <p>Againſt ſuch an enemy what could Theodore oppoſe? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious rectitude would not avail him to ward off the blow which diſappointed paſſion and powerful pride directed. Her diſtreſs was conſiderably heightened by reflecting that no intelligence of him could reach her at the Abbey, and that ſhe muſt remain ſhe knew not how long in the moſt dreadful ſuſpenſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his fate. From the Abbey ſhe ſaw no poſſibility of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. She was a priſoner in a chamber incloſed at every avenue: ſhe had no opportunity of converſing with any perſon who could afford her even a chance of relief; and ſhe ſaw herſelf condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to await in paſſive ſilence the impending deſtiny, infinitely more dreadful to her imagination than death itſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus circumſtanced, ſhe yielded to the preſſure of her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and would ſit for hours motionleſs and given up to thought. "Theodore!" ſhe would frequently exclaim, you cannot hear my voice, you cannot fly to help me; yourſelf a priſoner and in chains." The picture was too horrid. The ſwelling anguiſh of her heart would ſubdue her utterance—tears bathed her cheeks—and ſhe became inſenſible to every thing but the miſery of Theodore.</p>
                     <p>On this evening her mind had been remarkably tranquil; and as ſhe watched from her window, with a ſtill and melancholy pleaſure the ſetting ſun, the fading ſplendor of the weſtern ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:029379_0107_0FE08D07C816E470"/>
and the gradual approach of twilight, her thoughts bore her back to the time when, in happier circumſtances, ſhe had watched the ſame appearances. She recollected alſo the evening of her temporary eſcape from the abbey, when from this ſame window ſhe had viewed the declining ſun—how anxiouſly ſhe had awaited the fall of twilight—how much ſhe had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to anticipate the events of her future life—with what trembling fear ſhe had deſcended from the tower and ventured into the foreſt. Theſe reflections produced others that filled her heart with anguiſh and her eyes with tears.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe was loſt in her melancholy reverie, ſhe ſaw the Marquis mount his horſe, and depart from the gates. The ſight of him revived, in all its force, a ſenſe of the miſery he inflicted on her beloved Theodore, and a conſciouſneſs of the evils which more immediately threatened herſelf. She with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from the window in an agony of tears, which continuing for a conſiderable time, her frame was at length, quite exhauſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe retired early to reſt.</p>

When Peter left the room ſhe tenderly inquired what had diſturbed him, and he with a diſtorted ſmile, tried to be gay, but the effort was beyond his art, and he quickly relapſed into ſilence; or when Madame La Motte ſpoke, and he ſtrove to conceal the abſence of his thoughts, he anſwered ſo entirely from the purpoſe, that his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"What is it you fear?" ſaid La Motte in a tone ſcarcely articulate.—"O ſave me—ſave me from the Marquis!"</p>
                     <p>"Riſe then," ſaid he, "and dreſs yourſelf quickly—I ſhall be back again in a few minutes." He lighted a candle that ſtood on the table, and left the chamber. Adeline immediately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She heſitated and looked towards her chamber; but La Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te now approached the ſtairs, and with faltering ſteps, ſhe went to meet him. "I fear the Marquis may ſee me," ſaid ſhe, whiſpering; "where is he?" La Motte took her hand, and led her on, aſſuring her ſhe had nothing to fear from the Marquis. The wildneſs of his looks, however, and the trembling of his hand, ſeemed to contradict this aſſurance, and ſhe inquired whither he was leading her. "To the foreſt," ſaid La Motte "that you may eſcape from the abbey—a horſe waits for you without. "I can ſave you by no other means." New terror ſeized her. She would ſcarcely believe that La Motte, who had hitherto conſpired with the Marquis, and had ſo cloſely confined her, ſhould now himſelf undertake her eſcape, and ſhe at this moment felt a dreadful preſentiment, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>There was ſomething in his manner that ſpoke ſincerity, and ſhe ſuffered him to conduct her to a ſide door that opened into the foreſt, where ſhe could juſt diſtinguiſh through the gloom a man on horſeback. This brought to her remembrance the night in which ſhe had quitted the tomb, when truſting to the perſon who appeared, ſhe had been carried to the Marquis's villa. La Motte called, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He then told her that the Marquis, would return to the abbey on the following morning, and that this could be her only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity

                        </gap>; that ſhe might rely upon his (La Motte's) word, that Peter had orders to carry her wherever ſhe choſe; but as he knew the Marquis would be indefatigable in ſearch of her, he adviſed her by all means to leave the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which ſhe might do with Peter who was a native of Savoy, and would convey her to the houſe of his ſiſter. There ſhe might remain till La Motte himſelf who did not now think it would be ſafe to continue much longer in France, ſhould join her. He entreated her whatever might happen, never to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the events which had paſſed at the abbey. "To ſave you, Adeline<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have riſked my life; do not encreaſe my danger, and your own by any unneceſſary diſcoveries. We may never meet again, but I hope you will be happy; and remember when you think of me, that I am not quite ſo bad as I have been tempted to be."</p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, he gave her ſome money, which he told her would be neceſſary to defray the expenſes of her journey. Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line could no longer doubt his ſincerity, and her tranſports of joy and gratitude would ſcarcely permit her to thank him. She wiſhed to have bid Madame La Motte farewell, and indeed earneſtly requeſted it; but he again told her ſhe had no time to loſe, and, having wrapped her in a large cloak, he lifted her upon the horſe. She bade him adieu with tears of gratitude, and Peter ſet off as faſt as the darkneſs would permit.</p>
                     <p>When they were got ſome way, "I am glad with all my heart, Ma'amſelle," ſaid he, "to ſee you again. Who would have thought, after all, that my maſter himſelf would have bid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Adeline not chuſing to reproach him with the treachery of which ſhe feared he had been formerly guilty, thanked him for his good wiſhes, and ſaid ſhe hoped they ſhould be more fortunate: But Peter, in his uſual ſtrain of eloquence, proceeded to undeceive her in this point, and to acquaint her with every circumſtance which his memory, and it was naturally a ſtrong one, could furniſh.</p>
                     <p>Peter expreſſed ſuch an artleſs intereſt in her welfare and ſuch a concern for her diſappointment, that ſhe could no longer doubt his faithfulneſs; and this conviction not only ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her confidence in the preſent undertaking, but made her liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to his converſation with kindneſs and pleaſure. "I ſhould never have ſtaid at the abbey till this time," ſaid he, "if I could have got away; but my maſter frighted me ſo about the Marquis, and I had not money enough to carry me into my own

                     <p>"Poſſibly not," ſaid Adeline; "I am thankful to Monſieur La Motte that we have more certain means of procuring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences. What route ſhall you take when we leave the foreſt, Peter?"—Peter mentioned very correctly a great part of the road to Lyons: "and then," ſaid he, "we can eaſily get to Savoy, and that will be nothing. My ſiſter, God bleſs her! I hope is living; I have not ſeen her many a year, but if ſhe is not, all the people will be glad to ſee me, and you will eaſily get a lodging, Ma'amſelle, and every thing you want."</p>
                     <p>Adeline reſolved to go with him to Savoy. La Motte, who knew the character and deſigns of the Marquis, had adviſed her to leave the kingdom, and had told her, what her fears would have ſuggeſted, that the Marquis would be indefatigable in ſearch of her. His motive for this advice muſt be a deſire of ſerving her; why elſe, when ſhe was already in his power, ſhould he remove her to another place, and even furniſh her with money for the expenſes of a journey?</p>
                     <p>At Leloncourt, where Peter ſaid he was well known, ſhe would be moſt likely to meet with protection and comfort, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She inquired farther concerning the route they were to taken and whether Peter was ſufficiently acquainted with the road— "When once I get to Thiers, I know it well enough," ſaid Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, "for I have gone it many a time in my younger days, and any body will tell us the way there." They travelled for ſeveral hours in darkneſs and ſilence, and it was not till they emerged from the foreſt that Adeline ſaw the morning light ſtreak the eaſtern clouds. The ſight cheered and revived her; and as ſhe travelled ſilently along, her mind revolved the events of the paſt night and meditated plans for the future. The preſent kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of La Motte appeared ſo very different from his former c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duct, that it aſtoniſhed and perplexed her, and ſhe could only account for it by attributing it to one of thoſe ſudden impulſe of humanity which ſometimes operate even upon the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved hearts.</p>

                     <p>Peter now got directions to Thiers, which place they reached without any accident, and there ſtopped to refreſh themſelves. As ſoon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Peter thought the horſe ſufficiently reſted, they again ſet forward, and from the rich plains of the Lyonnois, Adeline, for the firſt time caught a view of the diſtant Alps, whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic heads ſeeming to prop the vault of heaven, filled her mind with ſublime emotions.</p>
                     <p>In a few hours they reached the vale, in which ſtands the city of Lyons, whoſe beautiful environs, ſtudded with villas, and rich with cultivation, withdrew Adeline from the melancholy contemplation of her own circumſtances, and her more painful anxiety for Theodore.</p>
                     <p>When they reached that buſy city, her firſt care was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire concerning the paſſage of the Rhone; but ſhe forbore to make theſe inquiries of the people of the inn, conſidering that if the Marquis ſhould trace her thither they might enable him to purſue her route. She, therefore, ſent Peter to the quays to hire a boat, while ſhe herſelf took a ſlight repaſt, it being her intention to embark immediately. Peter preſently returned, having engaged a boat and men to take them up the Rhone to the neareſt part of Savoy, from whence they were to proceed by land to the village of Leloncourt.</p>
                     <p>Having taken ſome refreſhment, ſhe ordered him to conduct her to the veſſel. A new and ſtriking ſcene preſented itſelf to Adeline, who looked with ſurpriſe upon the river gay with veſſels, and the quay crowded with buſy faces, and felt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt which the cheerful objects around bore to herſelf—to her an orphan, deſolate, helpleſs, and flying from perſecution and her country. She ſpoke with the Maſter of the boat, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent Peter back to the inn for the horſe, (La Motte's gift to Peter in lieu of ſome arrears of wages) they embarked.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="unknown:029379_0110_0FE08D1ED9407E28"/>
the ſcene through which ſhe floated, now frowning with ſavage grandeur, and now ſmiling in fertility, and gay with towns and villages ſoothed her mind, and her ſorrow gradually ſoftened into a gentle and not unpleaſing melancholy. She had ſeated herſelf at the head of the boat, where ſhe watched its ſides cleave the ſwift ſtream, and liſtened to the daſhing of the waters.</p>
                     <p>The boat, ſlowly oppoſing the current, paſſed along for ſome hours, and at length the veil of evening was ſtretched over the landſcape. The weather was fine, and Adeline, regardleſs of the dews that now fell, remained in the open air, obſerving the objects darken round her, the gay tints of the horizon fade away, and the ſtars gradually appear, trembling upon the lucid mirror of the waters. The ſcene was now ſunk in deep ſhadow, and the ſilence of the hour was broken only by the meaſured daſhing of the oars, and now and then by the voice of Peter ſpeaking to the boatmen. Adeline ſat loſt in thought: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lornneſs of her circumſtances came heightened to her imagination.</p>
                     <p>She ſaw herſelf ſurrounded by the darkneſs and ſtillneſs of night, in a ſtrange place, far diſtant from any friends, going, ſhe ſcarcely knew whither, under the guidance of ſtrangers and purſued, perhaps, by an inveterate enemy. She pictured to herſelf the rage of the Marquis, now that he had diſcovered her flight, and though ſhe knew it very unlikely he ſhould follow her by water, for which reaſon ſhe had choſen that manner of travelling, ſhe trembled at the portrait her fancy drew. Her thoughts then wandered to the plan ſhe ſhould adopt after reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Savoy; and much as her experience had prejudiced her againſt the manners of a convent, ſhe ſaw no place more likely to afford her a proper aſylum. At length ſhe retired to the little cabin for a few hours ropoſe.</p>
                     <p>She awoke with the dawn, and her mind being too much diſturbed to ſleep again, ſhe roſe and watched the gradual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of day. As ſhe muſed, ſhe expreſſed the feelings of the moment in the following</p>

                     <p>When Adeline left the Abbey, La Motte had remained for ſome time at the gate liſtening to the ſteps of the horſe that carried her, till the ſound was loſt in diſtance; he then turned into the hall with a lightneſs of heart to which he had long been a ſtranger. The ſatisfaction of having thus preſerved her as he hoped, from the deſigns of the Marquis, overcame for a while all ſenſe of the danger in which this ſtep muſt involve him. But when he returned entirely to his own ſituation, the terrors of the Marquis's reſentment ſtruck their full force upon his mind, and he conſidered how he might beſt eſcape it.</p>
                     <p>It was now paſt midnight—the Marquis was expected early on the following day; and in this interval, it at firſt appeared probable to him that he might quit the foreſt.

Scarcely allowing him time to collect what little effects might eaſily be carried with him, the officers conveyed him from the abbey; but the Marquis, in conſideration of the extreme diſtreſs of Madame La Motte, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected one of his ſervants to procure a carriage from Auboine that ſhe might follow her huſband.</p>

"No, no," ſaid he, "the hills there are very well for French hills, but they are not to be named on the ſame day with ours." Adeline, loſt in admiration of the aſtoniſhing and tremendous ſcenery around her, aſſented very warmly to the truth of Peter's aſſertion, which encouraged him to expatiate more largely upon the advantages of his country; its diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages he totally forgot; and though he gave away his laſt ſons

                     <p>Adeline, who now began to feel the effects of long anxiety and fatigue, much wiſhed to arrive at the end of her journey, and inquired impatiently of Peter concerning it. Her ſpirits, thus weakened, the gloomy grandeur of the ſcenes which had ſo lately awakened emotions of delightful ſublimity, now awed her into terror; ſhe trembled at the ſound of the torrents rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among the clifts and thundering in the vale below, and ſhrunk from the view of the precipices, which ſometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung the road, and at others appeared beneath it. Fatigued as ſhe was, ſhe frequently diſmounted to climb on foot the ſteep flinty road, which ſhe feared to travel on horſeback.</p>
                     <p>The day was cloſing when they drew near a ſmall village at the foot of the Savoy Alps, and the ſun in all his evening ſplendor now ſinking behind their ſummits, threw a farewel gleam athwart the landſcape, ſo ſoft and glowing as drew from Adeline, languid as ſhe was, an exclamation of rapture.</p>
                     <p>The romantic ſituation of the village next attracted her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. It ſtood at the foot of ſeveral ſtupendous mountains, which formed a chain round a lake at ſome little diſtance, and the woods that ſwept from the ſummits, almoſt emboſomed the village. The lake, unruffled by the lighteſt air, reflected the vermeil tints of the horizon with the ſublime ſcenery o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When Peter perceived the village, he burſt into a ſhout of joy. "Thank God," ſaid he, "we are near home; there is my dear native place. It looks juſt as it did twenty years age and there are the ſame old trees growing round our cottage yonder, and the huge rock that riſes above it. My Poor father died there Ma'amſelle.

of the lake yonder. I wonder whether he is alive yet. He was not old when I left the place, and as much beloved as ever man was, but death ſpares nobody!"</p>
                     <p>They had by this time reached the village which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely neat, though it did not promiſe much accommodation. Peter had hardly advanced ten ſteps before he was accoſted by ſome of his old acquaintance, who ſhook hands, and ſeemed not to know how to part with him. He inquired for his ſiſter, and was told ſhe was alive and well. As they paſſed on, ſo many of his old friends flocked round him, that Adeline became quite weary of the delay. Many whom he had left in the vigour of life were now tottering under the infirmities of age, while their ſons and daughters, whom he had known only in the playfulneſs of infancy, were grown from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and in the pride of youth. At length they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the cottage, and were met by his ſiſter, who having heard of his arrival, came and welcomed him with unfeigned joy.</p>
                     <p>On ſeeing Adeline, ſhe ſeemed ſurpriſed, but aſſiſted her to alight, and conducting her into a ſmall but neat cottage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her with a warmth of ready kindneſs which would have graced a better ſituation. Adeline deſired to ſpeak with her alone, for the room was now crowded with Peter's friends, and then acquainting her with ſuch particulars of her circumſtances as it was neceſſary to communicate, deſired to know if ſhe could be accommodated with lodging in the cottage. "Yes, Ma'amſelle," ſaid the good woman, "ſuch as it is, you are hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily welcome. I am only ſorry it is not better. But you ſeem ill, Ma'amſelle; what ſhall I get you?"</p>
                     <p>Adeline, who had been long ſtruggling with fatigue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, now yielded to their preſſure. She ſaid ſhe was, indeed, ill; but hoped that reſt would reſtore her, and deſired a bed might be immediately prepared. The good woman went out to obey her, and ſoon returning, ſhewed her to a little cabin, where ſhe retired to a bed, whoſe cleanlineſs was its only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation.</p>
                     <p>But, notwithſtanding her fatigue, ſhe could not ſleep, and her mind, in ſpite of all her efforts, returned to the ſcenes that were paſſed, or preſented gloomy and imperfect viſions of the future.</p>
                     <p>The difference between her own condition and that of other perſons, educated as ſhe had been, ſtruck her forcibly, and ſhe wept. "They," ſaid ſhe, "have friends and relations, all ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave them not only from what may hurt, but what may diſpleaſe them; watching not only for their preſent ſafety, but
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029379_0113_0FE08D3EE6602090"/>
for their future advantage, and preventing them even from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring themſelves.

                        </gap>ch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the time will come when"—She began to think ſhe might one time be happy; but recollecting the deſperate ſituation of Theodore, "No," ſaid ſhe, "I can never hope even for peace!"</p>
                     <p>Early the following morning the good woman of the houſe came to inquire how ſhe had reſted, and found ſhe had ſlept lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and was much worſe than on the preceding night. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs of her mind contributed to heighten the feveriſh ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms that attended her, and in the courſe of the day her diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der began to aſſume a ſerious aſpect. She obſerved its progreſs with compoſure, reſigning herſelf to the will of God, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little to regret in life. Her kind hoſteſs did every thing in her power to relieve her, and there was neither phyſician nor apothecary in the village, ſo that nature was deprived of none of her advantages. Notwithſtanding this, the diſorder rapidly increaſed, and on the third day from its firſt attack ſhe became delirious; after which ſhe ſunk into a ſtate of ſtupefaction.</p>
                     <p>How long ſhe remained in this deplorable condition ſhe knew not; but, on recovering her ſenſes, ſhe found herſelf in an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very different from any ſhe remembered. It was ſpacious and almoſt beautiful, the bed and every thing around being in one ſtile of elegant ſimplicity. For ſome minutes ſhe lay in a trance of ſurpriſe, endeavouring to recollect her ſcattered ideas of the paſt, and almoſt fearing to move, leſt the pleaſing viſions ſhould vaniſh from her eyes.</p>
                     <p>At length ſhe ventured to raiſe herſelf, when ſhe preſently heard a ſoft voice ſpeaking near her, and the bed curtain on one ſide was gently undrawn by a beautiful girl. As ſhe leaned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward over the bed, and with a ſmile of mingled tenderneſs and joy, inquired of her patient how ſhe did, Adeline gazed in ſilent admiration upon the moſt intereſting female countenance ſhe had ever ſeen, in which the expreſſion of ſweetneſs, united with lively ſenſe and refinement, was chaſtened by ſimplicity.</p>
                     <p>Adeline at length recollected herſelf ſufficiently to thank her kind inquirer, and begged to know to whom ſhe was obliged, and where ſhe was? The lovely girl preſſed her hand, "'Tis we who are obliged," ſaid ſhe. "Oh! how I rejoice to find you have recovered your recollection." She ſaid no more, but ſlew to the door of the apartment, and diſappeared. In a few minutes ſhe returned with an elderly lady, who, approaching
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029379_0113_0FE08D3EE6602090"/>
the bed with an air of tender intereſt, aſked concerning the ſtate of Adeline; to which the latter replied, as well as the agitation of her ſpirits would permit, and repeated her deſire of knowing to whom ſhe was ſo greatly obliged. "You ſhall know that hereafter," ſaid the lady; "at preſent be aſſured that you are with thoſe who will think their care much overpaid by your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; ſubmit, therefore, to every thing that may conduce to it, and conſent to be kept as quiet as poſſible."</p>
                     <p>Adeline gratefully ſmiled, and bowed her head in ſilent aſſent. The lady now quitted the room for a medicine; having given which to Adeline, the curtain was cloſed, and ſhe was left to repoſe. But her thoughts were too buſy to ſuffer her to profit by the opportunity. She contemplated the paſt, and viewed the preſent, and when ſhe compared them, the contraſt ſtruck her with aſtoniſhment. The whole appeared like one of thoſe ſudden tranſitions ſo frequent in dreams, in which we paſs from grief and deſpair, we know not how, to comfort and delight.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſhe looked forward to the future with a trembling anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that threatened to retard her recovery, and which, when ſhe remembered the words of her generous benefactors, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſuppreſs. Had ſhe better known the diſpoſition of the perſons in whoſe houſe ſhe now was, her anxiety, as far as it regarded herſelf, muſt in a great meaſure have been done away; for La Luc, its owner, was one of thoſe rare characters to whom misfortune ſeldom looks in vain, and whoſe native goodneſs, confirmed by principle, is uniform and unaſſuming in its acts. The following little picture of his domeſtic life, his family and his manners, will more fully illuſtrate his character. It was drawn from the life, and its exactneſs will, it is hoped, compenſate for its length.</p>

                     <p>His mind was penetrating; his views extenſive; and his ſyſtems, like his religion, were ſimple rational and ſublime. The people of his pariſh looked up to him as to a father; for while his precepts directed their minds, his example touched their hearts.</p>
                     <p>In early youth La Luc loſt a wife, whom he tenderly loved. This event threw a tincture of ſoft and intereſting melancholy over his character, which remained when time had mellowed the remembrance that occaſioned it. Philoſophy had ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, not hardened, his heart; it enabled him to reſiſt the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of affliction, rather than to overcome it.</p>
                     <p>Calamity taught him to feel with peculiar ſympathy the diſtreſſes of others. His income from the pariſh was ſmall, and what remained from the divided and reduced eſtates of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors did not much increaſe it; but though he could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways relieve the neceſſities of the indigent, his tender pity and holy converſation ſeldom failed in adminiſtering conſolation to the mental ſufferer. On theſe occaſions the ſweet and exquiſite emotions of his heart have often induced him to ſay, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>La Luc had one ſon and a daughter, who were too young, when their mother died to lament their loſs. He loved them with peculiar tenderneſs, as the children of her whom he never ceaſed to deplore; it was for ſome time his ſole amuſement to obſerve the gradual unfolding of their infant minds, and to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> his complaints he never obtruded upon others, and very ſeldom did he even mention his wife. His grief was too ſacred for
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029379_0114_0FE08D43A6DA8C68"/>
the eye of the vulgar. Often he retired to the deep ſolitude of the mountains, and amid their ſolemn and tremendous ſcenery would brood over the remembrance of times paſt, and reſign himſelf to the luxury of grief. On his return from theſe little excurſious he was always more placed and contented. A ſweet tranquillity, which aroſe almoſt to happineſs, was diffuſed over his mind, and his manners were more than uſually benevolent. As he gazed on his children, and fondly kiſſed them, a tear would ſometimes ſteal into his eye, but it was a tear of tender regret, unmingled with the darker qualities of ſorrow, and was moſt precious to his heart.</p>
                     <p>On the death of his wife he received into his houſe a maiden ſiſter, a ſenſible worthy woman, who was deeply intereſted in the happineſs of her brother. Her affectionate attention and judicious conduct anticipated the effect of time in ſoftening the poignancy of his diſtreſs, and her unremitted care of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, while it proved the goodneſs of her own heart, attracted her more cloſely to his.</p>
                     <p>It was with inexpreſſible pleaſure that he traced in the infant features of Clara the reſemblance of her mother. The ſame gentleneſs of manner and the ſame ſweetneſs of diſpoſition ſoon diſplayed themſelves, and as ſhe grew up, her actions frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reminded him ſo ſtrongly of his loſt wife, as to fix him in reveries which abſorbed all his ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Engaged in the duties of his pariſh, the education of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and in the philoſophic reſearch, his years paſſed in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. The tender melancholy with which affliction had tinctured his mind was, by long indulgence, become dear to him, and he would not have relinquiſhed it for the brighteſt dream of airy happineſs. When any paſſing incident diſturbed him, he retired for conſolation to the idea of her he ſo faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved, and yielding to a gentle, and what the world would call a romantic ſadneſs, gradually reaſſumed his compoſure. This was the ſecret luxury to which he withdrew from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary diſappointment—the ſolitary enjoyment which diſſipated the cloud of care, and blunted the ſting of vexation—which elevated his mind above this world, and opened to his view the ſublimity of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>other.</p>
                     <p>The ſpot he now inhabited, the ſurrounding ſcenery, the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic beauties of the neighbouring walks, were dear to La Luc, for they had once been loved by Clara; they had been the ſcenes of her tenderneſs, and of his happineſs.</p>
                     <p>His chateau ſtood on the borders of a ſmall lake that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt environed by mountains of ſtupendous height, which, ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029379_0115_0FE08C064500F5C8"/>
into a variety of groteſque forms, compoſed a ſcenery ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly ſolemn and ſublime. Dark woods intermingled with bold projections of rock, ſometimes barren, and ſometimes cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with the purple bloom of wild flowers, impended over the lake, and were ſeen in the clear mirror of its waters. The wild and alpine heights which roſe above were either crowned with perpetual ſnows, or exhibited tremendous crags and maſſes of ſolid rock, whoſe appearance was continually changing as the rays of light were variouſly reflected on their ſurface, and whoſe ſummits were often wrap in impenetrable miſts. Some cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and hamlets, ſcattered on the margin of the lake, or ſeated in pictureſque points of view on the rocks above, were the only objects that reminded the beholder of humanity.</p>
                     <p>On the ſide of the lake, nearly oppoſite to the chateau, the mountains receded, and a long chain of Alps were ſeen ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in perſpective. Their innumerable tints and ſhades, ſome veiled in blue miſts, ſome tinged with rich purple, and others glittering in partial light, gave luxurious and magical colouring to the ſcene.</p>
                     <p>The chateau was not large, but it was convenient and was characteriſed by an air of elegant ſimplicity and good order. The entrance was a ſmall hall, which opening by a glaſs door into the garden, afforded a view of the lake, with the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent ſcenery exhibited on its borders. On the left of the hall was La Luc's ſtudy, where he uſually paſſed his mornings; and adjoining was a ſmall room ſitted up with chymical apparatus, aſtronomical inſtruments, and other implements of ſcience. On the right was the family parlour, and behind it a room which belonged excluſively to Madame La Luc. Here were depoſite various medicines and botanical diſtillations, together with the apparatus for preparing them. From this room the whole vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage was liberally ſupplied with phyſical comfort; for it was the pride of Madame to believe herſelf ſkilful in relieving the diſorders of her neighbours.</p>
                     <p>Behind the chateau roſe a tuft of pines, and in front a gentle declivity, covered with verdure and flowers, extended to the lake, whoſe waters flowed even with the graſs, and gave freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the acacias that waved over its ſurface. Flowering ſhrubs, intermingled with mountain aſh, cypreſs, and ever-green oak, marked the boundary of the garden.</p>
                     <p>At the return of ſpring it was Clara's care to direct the young ſhoots of the plants, to nurſe the budding flowers, and to ſhelter them with the luxuriant branches of the ſhrubs from
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029379_0115_0FE08C064500F5C8"/>
the cold blaſts that deſcended from the mountains. In ſummer ſhe uſually roſe with the ſun, and viſited her favourite flowers while the dew yet hung glittering on their leaves. The freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of early day, with the glowing colouring which then touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſcenery, gave a pure and exquiſite delight to her innocent heart. Born amid the ſcenes of grandeur and ſublimity, ſhe had quickly imbibed a taſte for their charms, which taſte was heightened by the influence of a warm imagination. To view the ſun riſing above the Alps, tinging their ſnowy heads with light, and ſuddenly darting his rays over the whole face of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—to ſee the fiery ſplendour of the clouds reflected in the lake below, and the roſeate tints firſt ſteal upon the rocks above, were among the earlieſt pleaſures of which Clara was ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. From being delighted with the obſervance of nature, ſhe grew pleaſed with ſeeing her finely imitated, and ſoon diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a taſte for poetry and painting. When ſhe was about ſixteen often ſelected from her father's library thoſe of the Italian poets moſt celebrated for pictureſque beauty, and would ſpend the firſt hours of morning in reading them under the ſhade of the acacias that bordered the lake. Here too ſhe would often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt rude ſketches of the ſurrounding ſcenery, and at length, by repeated efforts, aſſiſted by ſome inſtruction from her brother, ſhe ſucceeded ſo well as to produce twelve drawings in crayon, which were judged worthy of decorating the parlour of the chateau.</p>
                     <p>Young La Luc played the flute, and ſhe liſtened to him with exquiſite delight, particularly when he ſtood on the margin of the lake, under her beloved acacias. Her voice was ſweet and flexible, though not ſtrong, and ſhe ſoon learned to modulate it to the inſtrument. She new nothing of the intricacies of execution; her airs were ſimple, and her ſtile equally ſo, buy ſhe ſoon gave them a touching expreſſion, inſpired by the ſenſibility of her heart, which ſeldom left thoſe of her hearers unaffected.</p>
                     <p>It was the happineſs of La Luc to ſee his children happy, and in one of his excurſions to Geneva, whither he went to viſit ſome relations of his late wife, he bought Clara a lute. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it with more gratitude than ſhe could expreſs; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned one air, ſhe haſtened to her favourite acacias and played it again and again till ſhe forgot every thing beſides. Her little domeſtic duties, her books, her drawing, even the hour which her father dedicated to her improvement, when ſhe met her brother in the library, and with him partook of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, even this hour paſſed unheeded by. La Luc ſuffered it to paſs. Madame was diſpleaſed that her niece neglected her
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029379_0116_0FE08D588FD4DF28"/>
domeſtic duties, and wiſhed to reprove her, but La Luc begged ſhe would be ſilent. "Let experience teach her her error," ſaid he; "precept ſeldom brings conviction to young minds."</p>
                     <p>Madame objected that experience was a ſlow teacher. "It is a ſure one," replied La Luc, "and is not unfrequently the quickeſt of all teachers: when it cannot lead us into ſerious evil, it is well to truſt to it."</p>
                     <p>The ſecond day paſſed with Clara as the firſt, and the third as the ſecond. She could now play ſeveral tunes; ſhe came to her father and repeated what ſhe had learnt.</p>
                     <p>At ſupper the cream was not dreſſed, and there was no fruit on the table. La Luc inquired the reaſon; Clara recollected it, and bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hed. She obſerved that her brother was abſent, but nothing was ſaid. Towards the concluſion of the repaſt he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; his countenance expreſſed unuſual ſatisfaction, but he ſeated himſelf in ſilence, Clara inquired what had detained him from ſupper, and learnt that he had been to a ſick family in the neighbourhood with the weakly allowance which her father gave them. La Luc had entruſted the care of this family to his daughter, and it was her duty to have carried them their little allowance on the preceding day, but ſhe had forgot every thing but muſic.</p>
                     <p>"How did you find the woman?" ſaid La Luc to his ſon. "Worſe, Sir," he replyed, "for her medicines had not been regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly given, and the children had had little or no food to-day."</p>
                     <p>Clara was ſhocked. "No food to-day!" ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "and I have been playing all day on my lute, under the aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias by the ſake!" Her father did not ſeem to obſerve her emotion, but turned to his ſon. "I left her better," ſaid the latter; "the medicines I carried eaſed her pain, and I had the pleaſure to ſee her children make a joyful ſupper."</p>
                     <p>Clara, perhaps for the firſt time in her life, envied him his pleaſure; her heart was full and ſhe ſat ſilent. "No food to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day," thought ſhe.</p>
                     <p>She retired penſively to her chamber. The ſweet ſeren<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"What a pity," ſaid ſhe, "that what is ſo pleaſing ſhould be the cauſe of ſo much pain! "This lute is my delight, and my torment!" This reflection occaſioned her much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal debate but before ſhe could come to any reſolution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the point in queſtion, ſhe fell aſleep.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="unknown:029379_0116_0FE08D588FD4DF28"/>She awoke very early the next morning, and impatiently watched the progreſs of the dawn. The ſun at length appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe aroſe, and determined to make all the attonement in her power for her former neglect, haſtened to the cottage.</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe remained a conſiderable time, and when ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the chateau her countenance had recovered all its uſual ſerenity. She reſolved, however, not to touch her lute that day.</p>
                     <p>Till the hour of breakfaſt ſhe buſied herſelf in binding up the flowers, and pruning the ſhoots that were too luxuriant, and ſhe at length found herſelf, ſhe ſcarcely knew how, beneath her beloved acacias by the ſide of the lake. "Ah!" ſaid ſhe, with a ſigh, "how ſweetly would the ſong I learned yeſterday, ſound now over the waters!" But ſhe remembered her determination, and checked the ſtep ſhe was involuntarily taking towards the chateau.</p>
                     <p>She attended her father in the library at the uſual hour, and learned, from his diſcourſe with her brother on what had been read the two preceding days, that ſhe had loſt much entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge. She requeſted her father would inform her to what this converſation alluded; but he calmly-replied, that ſhe had preferred another amuſement at the time when the ſubject was diſcuſſed, and muſt therefore content herſelf with ignorance.</p>
                     <p>"You would reap the rewards of ſtudy from the amuſements of idleneſs," ſaid he, "learn to be reaſonable—do not expect to unite inconſiſtencies."</p>
                     <p>Clara felt the juſtneſs of this rebuke, and remembered her lute. "What miſchief has it occaſioned!" ſighed ſhe. "Yes, I am determined not to touch it at all this day. I will prove that I am able to controul my inclinations when I ſee it neceſſary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She adhered to her reſolution, and towards the cloſe of day went into the garden to amuſe herſelf. The evening was ſtill and uncommonly beautiful. Nothing was heard but the faint ſhivering of the leaves, which returned but at intervals, making ſilence more ſolemn, and the diſtant murmurs of the torrents that rolled among the cliffs. As ſhe ſtood by the lake, and watched the ſun ſlowly ſinking below the Alps, whoſe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits were tinged with gold and purple; as ſhe ſaw the laſt rays o light gleam upon the waters whoſe ſurface was not curled by the lighteſt air, ſhe ſighed, "Oh! how enchanting would be the ſound of my lute at this moment, on this ſpot, and when every thing is ſo ſtill around me!"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:029379_0117_0FE08D6068E74488"/>The temptation was too powerful for the reſolution of Clara: ſhe ran to the chateau, returned with the inſtrument to her dear acacias, and beneath their ſhade continued to play till the ſurrounding objects faded in darkneſs from her fight, But the moon aroſe, and ſhedding a trembling luſtre on the lake, made the ſcene more captivating than ever.</p>
                     <p>It was impoſſible to quit ſo delightful a ſpot; Clara repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her favourite airs again and again. The beauty of the hour awakened all her genius; ſhe never played with ſuch expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before, and ſhe liſtened with increaſing rapture to the tones as they languiſhed over the waters and died away on the diſtant air. She was perfectly enchanted "No! nothing was ever ſo delighful as to play on the lute beneath her acacias, on the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the lake, by moon-light!"</p>
                     <p>When ſhe returned to the chateau, ſupper was over. La Luc had obſerved Clara, and would not ſuffer her to be interrupted.</p>
                     <p>When the enthuſiaſm of the hour was paſſed ſhe recollected that ſhe had broken her reſolution, and the reflection gave her pain. "I prided myſelf on controling my inclinations," ſaid ſhe, "and I have weakly yielded to their direction. But what evil have I incurred by indulging them this evening? I have neglected no duty, for I had none to perform. Of what th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>She pauſed, not quite ſatisfied with this reaſoning. Sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſuming her inquiry, "But how," ſaid ſhe, "am I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that I ſhould have reſiſted my inclinations if there <hi>had</hi> been a reaſon for oppoſing them? If the poor family whom I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected yeſterday had been unſupplied to day, I fear I ſhould again have forgotten them while I played on my lute on the banks of the lake."</p>
                     <p>She then recollected all that her father had at different times ſaid on the ſubject of ſelf-command, and ſhe felt ſome pain.</p>
                     <p>"No," ſaid ſhe, "if I do not conſider that to preſerve a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which I have once ſolemnly formed, is a ſufficient reaſon to control my inclinations, I fear no other motive would long reſtrain me. I ſeriouſly determined not to touch my lute this whole day, and I have broken my reſolution. To-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row perhaps I may be tempted to neglect ſome duty, for I have diſcovered that I cannot rely on my own prudence. Since I cannot conquer temptation, I will fly from it."</p>

                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:029379_0117_0FE08D6068E74488"/>On the following morning ſhe brought her lute to La Luc, and begged he would receive it again, and at leaſt keep it till ſhe had taught her inclinations to ſubmit to control.</p>
                     <p>The heart of La Luc ſwelled as ſhe ſpoke. "No, Clara," ſaid he, "it is unneceſſary that I ſhould receive your lute; the ſacrifice you would make proves you worthy of my confidence. Take back the inſtrument; ſince you have ſufficient reſolution to reſign it when it leads you from duty, I doubt not that you will be able to control its influence now that it is reſtored to you."</p>
                     <p>Clara felt a degree of pleaſure and pride at theſe words, ſuch as ſhe had never before experienced; but ſhe thought, that to deſerve the commendation they beſtowed, it was neceſſary to complete the ſacrifice ſhe had begun. In the virtuous enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm of the moment the delights of muſic were forgotten in thoſe of aſpiring to well earned praiſe, and when ſhe refuſed the lute thus offered, ſhe was conſcious only of exquiſite ſenſations. "Dear Sir," ſaid ſhe, tears of pleaſure ſwelling in her eyes, "allow me to deſerve the praiſes you beſtow, and then I ſhall indeed be happy."</p>
                     <p>La Luc thought ſhe had never reſembled her mother ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

When he was able to ſpeak, "You do already deſerve my praiſes," ſaid he, "and I reſtore your lute as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the conduct which excites them." This ſcene called back recollections too tender for the heart of La Luc, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Clara the inſtrument, he abruptly quitted the room.</p>
                     <p>La Luc's ſon, a youth of much promiſe, was deſigned by his father for the church, and had received from him an excellent education which, however, it was thought neceſſary he ſhould finiſh at an univerſity. That of Geneva was fixed upon by La Luc. His ſcheme had been to make his ſon not a ſcholar only; he was ambitious that he ſhould alſo be enviable as a man. From early infancy he had accuſtomed him to hardihood and endurance, and as he advanced in youth, he encouraged him in manly exerciſes, and acquainted him with the uſeful arts as well as with abſtract ſcience.</p>
                     <p>He was high ſpirited and ardent in his temper, but his heart was generous and affectionate. He looked forward to Geneva, and to the new world it would diſcloſe, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

To have been related to his wife was a ſufficient claim upon the heart of La Luc, and he had, therefore, always kept up an intercourſe with Mr. Audley, though the difference in their characters and manner of thinking would never permit this aſſociation to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance into friendſhip. La Luc now wrote to him, ſignifying as intention of ſending his ſon to Geneva, and recommending him to his care; to this letter Mr. Audley returned a friendly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and a ſhort time after an acquaintance of La Luc's being called to Geneva, he determined that his ſon ſhould accompany him. The ſeparation was painful to La Luc, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable to Clara. Madame was grieved, and took care that he ſhould have a ſufficient quantity of medicines put up in his travelling trunk; ſhe was alſo at ſome pains to point out their virtues, and the different complaints for which they were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; but ſhe was careful to deliver her lecture during the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of her brother.</p>
                     <p>La Luc with his daughter, accompanied his ſon on horſeback to the next town, which was about eight miles from Lel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

deſired ſhe would explain herſelf, and the woman proceeded to ſay, that her brother Peter, whom ſhe had not ſeen for ſo many years, was arrived, and had brought a young lady to her cottage, who ſhe verily believed was dying. She deſcribed her diſorder, and acquainted Madame with what particulars of her mournful ſtory Peter had related, failing not to exaggerate ſuch as her compaſſion for the unhappy ſtranger and her love of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous prompted.</p>
                     <p>The account appeared a very extraordinary one to Madame: but pity for the forlorn condition of the young ſufferer induced her to inquire farther into the affair. "Do let me go to her, Madame," ſaid Clara, who had been liſtening with ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to the poor woman's narrative: "do ſuffer me to go— ſhe muſt want comforts, and I wiſh much to ſee how ſhe is." Madame aſked ſome farther queſtions concerning her diſorder, and then taking off her ſpectacles, ſhe roſe from her chair and ſaid ſhe would go herſelf. Clara deſired to accompany her. They put on their hats and followed the good woman to the cottage, where in a very ſmall cloſe room, on a miſerable bed, lay Adeline, pale, emaciated, and unconſcious of all around her. Madame turned to the woman, and aſked how long ſhe had been in this way, while Clara went up to the bed, and taking the almoſt lifeleſs hand that lay on the quilt, looked anxiouſly in her face. "She obſerves nothing," ſaid ſhe, "poor creature! I wiſh ſhe was at the chateau, ſhe would be better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, and I could nurſe her there." The woman told Madame La Luc, that the young lady had lain in that ſtate for ſeveral hours. Madame examined her pulſe, and ſhook her head. "This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>"We will ſee about that," ſaid her aunt. "In the mean time let me ſpeak to Peter; it is ſome years ſince I ſaw him." She went to the outer room, and the woman ran out of the cattage to look for him. When ſhe was gone. "This is a miſerable habitation for the poor ſtranger," ſaid Clara; "ſhe will never be well here: do, Madame, let her be carried to our houſe; I am ſure my father would wiſh it. Beſides, there is ſomething in her features, even inanimate as they now are, that prejudices me in her favour."</p>
                     <p>"Shall I never perſuade you to give up that romantic notion of judging people by their faces," ſaid her aunt. "What ſort of a face ſhe has, is of very little conſequence—her condition is
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:029379_0119_0FE08D748EE44180"/>
lamentable, and I am deſirous of altering it; but I wiſh firſt to aſk Peter a few queſtions concerning her.</p>
                     <p>"Thank you my dear aunt," ſaid Clara; "ſhe will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved then." Madame La Luc was going to reply; but Peter now entered, and expreſſing great joy at ſeeing her again, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired how Monſieur La Luc and Clara did. Clara immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately welcomed honeſt Peter to his native place, and he returned her ſalutation with many expreſſions of ſurpriſe at finding her <hi>ſo much grown.</hi> "Though I have ſo often dandled you in my arms, Ma'amſelle, I ſhould never have known you again. Young twigs ſhoot faſt, as they ſay."</p>
                     <p>Madame La Luc now inquired into the particulars of Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line's ſtory, and heard as much as Peter knew of it, being only that his late maſter found her in a very diſtreſſed ſituation, and that he had himſelf brought her from the Abbey to ſave her from a French Marquis. The ſimplicity of Peter's manner would not ſuffer her to queſtion his veracity, though ſome of the circumſtances he related excited all her ſurpriſe, and awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened all her pity. Tears frequently ſtood in Clara's eyes dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the courſe of his narrative, and when he concluded, ſhe ſaid, "Dear Madame, I am ſure when my father learns the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of this unhappy young woman, he will not refuſe to be a parent to her, and I will be her ſiſter."</p>
                     <p>"She deſerves it all," ſaid Peter, "for ſhe is very good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed." He then proceeded in a ſtrain of praiſe, which was very unuſual with him. "I will go home and conſult my brother about her," ſaid Madame La Luc, riſing: "ſhe certainly ought to be removed to a more airy room.

                     <p>La Luc had juſt returned from his evening walk when they reached the chateau. Madame told him where ſhe had been, and related the hiſtory of Adeline and her preſent condition. "By all means have her removed hither," ſaid La Luc, whoſe eyes bore teſtimony to the tenderneſs of his heart. "She can be better attended to here than in Suſan's cottage."</p>
                     <p>"I knew you would ſay ſo, my dear father," ſaid Clara: "I will go and order the green bed to be prepared for her."</p>
                     <p>"Be patient, niece," ſaid Madame La Luc; "there is no occaſion for ſuch haſte: ſome things are to be conſidered firſt; but you are young and romantic." La Luc ſmiled, "The evening is now cloſed," reſumed Madame; "it will, therefore,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:029379_0119_0FE08D748EE44180"/>
be dangerous to remove her before morning. Early to morrow a room ſhall be got ready, and ſhe ſhall be brought here; in the mean time I will go and make up a medicine, which I hope may be of ſervice to her." Clara reluctantly aſſented to this delay, and Madame La Luc retired to her cloſet.</p>
                     <p>On the following morning Adeline, wrapped in blankets, and ſheltered as much as poſſible from the air, was brought to the chateau, where the good La Luc deſired ſhe might have every attention paid her, and where Clara watched over her with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing anxiety and tenderneſs. She remained in a ſtate of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por during the greater part of the day, but towards evening ſhe breathed more freely; and Clara, who ſtill watched by her bed, had at length the pleaſure of perceiving that her ſenſes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. It was at this moment that ſhe found herſelf in the ſituation from which we have digreſſed to give this account of the venerable La Luc and his family.

                     <p>ADELINE, aſſiſted by a fine conſtitution, and the kind at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of her new friends, was in a little more than a week ſo much recovered as to leave her chamber. She was introduced to La Luc, whom ſhe met with tears of gratitude, and thanked for his goodneſs in a manner ſo warm, yet ſo artleſs, as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted him ſtill more in her favour. During the progreſs of her recovery, the ſweetneſs of her behaviour had entirely won the heart of Clara, and greatly intereſted that of her aunt, whoſe reports of Adeline, together with the praiſes beſtowed by Clara, had excited both eſteem and curioſity in the breaſt of La Luc; and he now met her with an expreſſion of benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which ſpoke peace and comfort to her heart. She had acquainted Madame La Luc with ſuch particulars of her ſtory as Peter, either through ignorance or inattention, had not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, ſuppreſſing only, through a falſe delicacy, perhaps,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029379_0120_0FE08D793984BB40"/>
an acknowledgement of her attachment to Theodore. Theſe circumſtances were repeated to La Luc, who, ever ſenſible to the ſufferings of others, was particularly intereſted by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular misfortunes of Adeline.</p>
                     <p>Near a fortnight had elapſed ſince her removal to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau, when one morning La Luc deſired to ſpeak with her alone. She followed him into his ſtudy, and then in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the moſt delicite, he told her, that, as he found ſhe was ſo unfortunate in her father, he deſired ſhe would henceforth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as her perent, and his houſe as her home. "You and Clara ſhall be equally my daughters," continued he; I am rich in having ſuch children." The ſtrong emotions of ſurpriſe and gratitude for ſome time kept Adeline ſilent. "Do not thank me, ſaid La Luc; "I know all you would ſay, and I know alſo that I am but doing my duty. I thank God that my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and my pleaſures are generally in uniſon." Adeline wiped away the tears which his goodneſs had excited, and was going to ſpeak; but La Luc preſſed her hand, and, turning away to conceal his emotion, walked out of the room.</p>
                     <p>Adeline was now conſidered as a part of the family, and in the parental kindneſs of La Luc, the ſiſterly affection of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, and the ſteady and uniform regard of Madame, ſhe would have been happy as ſhe was thankful, had not unceaſing anxiety for the fate of Theodore, of whom in this ſolitude ſhe was leſs likely than ever to hear, corroded her heart, and embittered every moment of reflection. Even when ſleep obliterated for a while the memory, of the paſt, his image frequently aroſe to her fancy, accompanied by all the exegrations of terror. She ſaw him in chains, and ſtruggling in the graſp of ruffians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſaw him led, amidſt the dreadful preparations for execution, into the field: She ſaw the agony of his look, and heard him repeat her name in frantic accents till the horrors of the ſcene overcame her, and ſhe awoke.</p>
                     <p>A ſimilarity of taſte and character attached her to Clara, yet the miſery that preyed upon her heart was of a nature too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate to be ſpoken of, and ſhe never mentioned Theodore even to her friend. Her illneſs had yet left her weak and languid, and the perpetual anxiety of her mind contributed to prolong this ſtate. She endeavoured by ſtrong and almoſt continual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, to abſtract her thoughts from their mournful ſubject, and was often ſucceſsful. La Luc had an excellent library, and the inſtruction it offered at once gratified her love of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and withdrew her mind from painful recollections. His converſation too afforded her another refuge from miſery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:029379_0120_0FE08D793984BB40"/>But her chief amuſement was to wander among the ſublime ſcenery of the adjacent country, ſometimes with Clara, though often with no other companion than a book. There were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed times when the converſation of her friend impoſed a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſtraint, and, when given up to reflection ſhe would ramble alone through ſcenes, whoſe ſolitary grandeur aſſiſted and ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the melancholy of her heart. Here ſhe would retrace all the conduct of her beloved Theodore, and endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect his exact countenance, his air, and manner. Now ſhe would weep at the remembrance and then, ſuddenly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had perhaps already ſuffered an ignomenious death for her ſake, even in conſequence of the very action which had proved his love, a dreadful deſpair would ſeize her, and arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her tears, would threaten to bear down every barrier that fortitude and reaſon could oppoſe.</p>
                     <p>Fearing longer to truſt her own thoughts, ſhe would hurry home, and by a deſperate effort would try to loſe, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of La Luc, the remembrance of the paſt. Her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, when he obſerved it, La Luc, attributed to a ſenſe of the cruel treatment ſhe had received from her father; a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which, by exciting his compaſſion, endeared her more ſtrongly to his heart; while that love of rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, which in her calmer hours ſo frequently appeared, opened to him a new ſource of amuſement in the cultivation of mind eager for knowledge, and ſuſceptible of all the energies of genius. She found a melancholy pleaſure in liſtening to the ſoft tones of Clara's lute, and would often ſoothe her mind by attempting to repeat the airs ſhe heard.</p>
                     <p>The gentleneſs of her manners, partaking ſo much of that penſive character which marked La Luc's, was ſoothing to his heart, and tinctured his behaviour with a degree of tenderneſs that imparted comfort to her, and gradually won her entire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and affection. She ſaw with extreme concern the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining ſtate of his health, and united her efforts with thoſe of the family to amuſe and revive him.</p>
                     <p>The pleaſing ſociety of which ſhe partook, and the quietneſs of the country, at length reſtored her mind to a ſtate of tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compoſure. She was now acquainted with all the wild walks of the neighbouring mountains, and, never tired of view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their aſtoniſhing ſcenery, ſhe often indulged herſelf in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing alone their unfrequented paths, where now and then a peaſant from a neighbouring village was all that interrupted the profound ſolitude. She generally took with her a book,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029379_0121_0FE08D8627FCFFE0"/>
that if ſhe perceived her thoughts inclined to fix on the one object of her grief, ſhe might force them to a ſubject leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to her peace. She had become a tolerable proficient in Engliſh while at the convent where ſhe received her education, and the inſtruction of La Luc, who was well acquainted with the language, now ſerved to perfect her. He was partial to the Engliſh; he admired their character, and the conſtitution of their laws, and his library contained a collection of their beſt authors, particularly of their philoſophers and poets. Adeline found that no ſpecies of writing had power ſo effectually to withdraw her mind from the contemplation of its own miſery, as the higher kinds of poetry, and in theſe her taſte ſoon taught her to diſtinguiſh the ſuperiority of the Engliſh from that of the French. The genius of the language more perhaps than the genius of the people, if indeed the diſtinction may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, occaſioned this.</p>
                     <p>She frequently took a volume of Shakeſpear or Milton, and, having gained ſome wild eminence, would ſeat herſelf beneath the pines, whoſe low murmurs ſoothed her heart, and conſpired with the viſions of the poet to lull her to forgetfulneſs of grief.</p>
                     <p>One evening, when Clara was engaged at home, Adeline wandered alone to a favourite ſpot among the rocks that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the lake. It was an eminence which commanded an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire view of the lake, and of the ſtupendous mountains that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed it. A few ragged thorns grew from the precipice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, which deſcended perpendicularly to the water's edge; and above roſe a thicK wood of larch, pine, and ſir, intermingled with ſome cheſnut and mountain aſh. The evening was fine, and the air ſo ſtill, that it ſcarcely waved the light leaves of the trees around, or rimpled the broad expanſe of the waters below. Adeline gazed on the ſcene with a kind of ſtill rapture, and watched the ſun ſinking amid a crimſon glow, which tinted the boſom of the lake and the ſnowy heads of the diſtant Alps. The delight which the ſcenery inſpired
<q>
                           <l>"Sooth'd each guſt of paſſion into peace,</l>
                           <l>"All but the ſwellings of the ſoften'd heart,</l>

                     <p>La Luc obſerving how much Adeline was charmed with the features of the country, and deſirous of amuſing her melancholy, which notwithſtanding her efforts, was often too apparent, wiſhed to ſhew her other ſcenes than thoſe to which her walks was circumſcribed. He propoſed a party on horeſeback to take a nearer view of the Glaciers; to attempt their aſcent was a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029379_0122_0FE08D8AB5C8EFA8"/>
and fatigue to which neither La Luc, in his preſent ſtate of health, nor Adeline were equal. She had not been accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ride ſingle, and the mountainous road they were to paſs made experiment rather dangerous; but ſhe concealed her fears, and they were not ſufficient to make her wiſh to forego an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment ſuch as was now offered her.</p>
                     <p>The following day was fixed for this excurſion. La Luc and his party aroſe at an early hour, and having taken a ſlight breakfaſt, they ſat out towards the Glacier of Montanvert, which lay at a few leagues diſtance, Peter carried a ſmall baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of proviſions; and it was their plan to dine on ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſpot in the open air.</p>
                     <p>It is unneceſſary to deſcribe the high enthuſiaſm of Adeline the more complacent pleaſure of La Luc, and the tranſports of Clara, as the ſcenes of this romantic country ſhifted to their eyes. Now frowning in dark and gloomy grandeur, it exhibited only tremendous rocks, and cataracts rolling from the heights into ſome deep and narrow valley, along which their united water roared and foamed, and burſt away to regions inacceſſible to to mortal foot; and now the ſcene aroſe lefs fiercely wild;
<q>"The pomp of groves and garniture of fields"</q>
were intermingled with the ruder features of nature, and while the ſnow froze on the ſummit of the mountain, the vine bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at its foot.</p>
                     <p>Engaged in intereſting converſation, and by the admiration which the country excited, they travelled on till noon, when they looked round for a pleaſant ſpot where they might re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and take refreſhment. At ſome little diſtance they perceived the ruins of a fabric which had once been a caſtle; it ſtood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt on a point of rock that overhung a deep valley; and its broken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The edifice invited curioſity, and the ſhades repoſe— La Luc and his party advanced.</p>

                     <p>They ſeated themſelves on the graſs under the ſhade of ſome high trees near the ruins. An opening in the woods afforded a view of the diſtant Alps—the deep ſilence of ſolitude reigned. For ſome time they were loſt in meditation. Adeline felt a
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029379_0122_0FE08D8AB5C8EFA8"/>
ſweet complacency, ſuch as ſhe had long been a ſtranger to. Looking at La Luc, ſhe perceived a tear ſtealing down his cheek, while the elevation of his mind was ſtrongly expreſſed on his countenance. He turned on Clara his eyes, which were now filled with tenderneſs, and made an effort to recover himſelf.</p>
                     <p>"The ſtillneſs and total ſecluſion of this ſcene," ſaid Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, "thoſe ſtupendous mountains, the gloomy grandeur of theſe woods, together with that monument of faded glory on which the hand of time is ſo emphatically impreſſed, diffuſe a ſacred enthuſiaſm over the mind, and awaken ſenſations truly ſublime."</p>
                     <p>La Luc was going to ſpeak; but Peter coming forward, deſired to know whether he had not better open the wallet, as he fancied his honour and the young ladies muſt be main hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, jogging on ſo far up hill and down before dinner. They acknowledged the truth of honeſt Peter's ſuſpicion, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hint.</p>
                     <p>Refreſhments were ſpread on the graſs, and having ſeated themſelves under the canopy of waving woods, ſurrounded by the ſweets of wild flowers, they inhaled the poor breeze of the Alps, which might be called ſpirit of air, and partook of a repaſt which theſe circumſtances rendered delicious.</p>
                     <p>When they aroſe to depart, "I am unwilling," ſaid Clara, "to quit this charming ſpot. How delightful would it be to paſs one's life beneath theſe ſhades with the friends who are dear to one!"—La Luc ſmiled at the romantic ſimplicity of the idea; but Adeline ſighed deeply to the image of felicity, and of Theodore, which it recalled, and turned away to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal her tears.</p>
                     <p>They now mounted their horſes, and ſoon after arrived at the foot of Montanvert. The emotions of Adeline, as ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated in various points of view the aſtoniſhing objects around her, ſurpaſſed all expreſſion; and the feelings of the whole party were too ſtrong to admit of converſation. The profound ſtillneſs which reigned in theſe regions of ſolitude inſpired awe, and heightened the ſublimity of the ſcenery to an exquiſite degree.</p>
                     <p>"It ſeems," ſaid Adeline, "as if we were walking over the ruins of the world, and were the only perſons who had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the wreck. I can ſcarcely perſuade myſelf that we are not left alone on the globe."</p>
                     <p>"The view of theſe objects," ſaid La Luc, "lifts the ſoul to their Great Author, and we contemplate with a feeling al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029379_0123_0FE08D9947960058"/>
too vaſt for humanity—the ſublimity of his nature in the grandeur of his works." La Luc raiſed his eyes, filled with tears, to heaven, and was for ſome moments loſt in ſilent adoration.</p>
                     <p>They quitted theſe ſcenes with extreme reluctance; but the hour of the day, and the appearance of the clouds, which ſeemed gathering for a ſtorm, made them haſten their departure. Could ſhe have been ſheltered from its fury, Adeline almoſt wiſhed to have witneſſed the tremendous effect of a thunder ſtorm in theſe regions.</p>
                     <p>They returned to Leloncourt by a different route, and the ſhade of the overhanging precipices was deepened by the gloom of the atmoſphere. It was evening when they came within view of the lake, which the travellers rejoiced to ſee, for the ſtorm ſo long threatened was now faſt approaching; the thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der murmered among the Alps; and the dark vapours that rolled heavily along their ſides heightened their dreadful ſublimity. La Luc would have quickened his pace, but the road winding down the ſteep ſide of a mountain made caution neceſſary. The darkening air and the lightnings that now flaſhed along the horizon terrified Clara, but ſhe withheld the expreſſion of her fear in conſideration of her father. A peal of thunder which ſeemed to ſhake the earth to its foundations, and was reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in tremendous echoes from the cliffs, burſt over their heads, Clara's horſe took fright at the ſound, and ſetting off, hurried her with amazing velocity down the mountain towards the lake, which waſhed its foot. The agony of La Luc, who viewed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Clara kept her ſeat, but terror had almoſt deprived her of ſenſe. Her efforts to preſerve herſelf was mechanical, for ſhe ſcarcely knew what ſhe did. The horſe, however, carried her ſafely almoſt to the foot of the mountain, but was making towards the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>She ſoon recovered, and uncloſing her eyes found herſelf i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="87" facs="unknown:029379_0123_0FE08D9947960058"/>
to thank him for his kindneſs when La Luc and Adeline came up. The terror impreſſed on her father's features was perceived by Clara; languid as ſhe was, ſhe tried to raiſe herſelf, and ſaid, with a faint ſmile, which betrayed, inſtead of diſguiſing her ſufferings, "Dear Sir, I am not hurt." Her pale countenance and the blood that trinkled down her cheek contradicted her words. But La Luc, to whom terror had ſuggeſted the utmoſt poſſible evil, now rejoiced to hear her ſpeak; he recalled ſome preſence of mind, and while Adeline applied her ſalts, he chaſed her temples.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe revived ſhe told him how much ſhe was obliged to the ſtranger. La Luc endeavoured to expreſs his gratitude; but the former interrupting him, begged he might be ſpared the pain of receiving thanks for having followed only an impulſe of common humanity.</p>
                     <p>They were now not far from Leloncourt; but the evening was almoſt ſhut in, and the thunder murmured deeply among the hills. La Luc was diſtreſſed how to convey Clara home.</p>
                     <p>In endeavouring to raiſe her from the ground, the ſtranger betrayed ſuch evident ſymptoms of pain, that La Luc inquired concerning it. The ſudden jerk which the horſe had given the arm of the chevalier, in eſcaping from his hold, had violently ſprained his ſhoulder, and rendered his arm almoſt uſeleſs. The pain was exquiſite, and La Luc, whoſe fears for his daughter were now ſubſiding, was ſhocked at the circumſtance, and preſſed the ſtranger to accompany him to the village, where relief might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. He accepted the invitation, and Clara, being at length placed on a horſe led by her father, was conducted to the chateau.</p>
                     <p>When Madame, who had been looking out for La Luc ſome time, perceived the cavalcade approaching, ſhe was alarmed, and her apprehenſions were confirmed when ſhe ſaw the ſituation of her neice. Clara was carried into the houſe. And La Luc would have ſent for a ſurgeon, but there was none within ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral leagues of the village, neither were there any of the phyſical profeſſion within the ſame diſtance. Clara was aſſiſted to her chamber by Adeline, and Madame La Luc undertook to exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine the wounds. The reſult reſtored peace to the family; for though ſhe was much bruiſed, ſhe had eſcaped material injury; a flight contuſion on the forehead had occaſioned the bloodſhed which at firſt alarmed La Luc. Madame undertook to reſtore her neice in a few days with the aſſiſtance of a balſam compoſed by herſelf, on the virtues of which ſhe deſcanted with great elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, till La Luc interrupted her by reminding her of the condition of her patient.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="unknown:029379_0124_0FE08D9DE4EDCFC8"/>Madame having bathed Clara's bruiſes, and given her a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial of incomparable efficacy, left her, and Adeline watched in the chamber of her friend till ſhe retired to her own for the night.</p>
                     <p>La Luc, whoſe ſpirits had ſuffered much perturbation, was now tranquillized by the report his ſiſter made of Clara. He introduced the ſtranger, and having mentioned the accident he had met with, deſired that he might have immediate aſſiſtance. Madame haſtened to her cloſet, and it is perhaps difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether ſhe felt moſt concern for the ſufferings of her gueſt, or pleaſure at the opportunity thus offered of diſplaying her phyſical ſkill. However this might be, ſhe quitted the room with great alacrity, and very quickly returned with a phial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining her ineſtimable balſam, and having given the neceſſary directions for the application of it, ſhe left the ſtranger to the care of his ſervant.</p>
                     <p>La Luc inſiſted that the chevalier, M. Verneuil, ſhould not leave the chateau that night, and he very readily ſubmitted to be detained. His manners during the evening were as frank and engaging as the hoſpitality and gratitude of La Luc were ſincere, and they ſoon entered into intereſting converſation. M. Verneuil converſed like a man who had ſeen much, and thought more, and if he diſcovered any prejudice in his opinions, it was evidently the prejudice of a mind which, ſeeing objects through the medium of its own goodneſs, tinges them with the hue of its predominant quality. La Luc was much pleaſed, for in his retired ſituation he had not often an opportunity of receiving the pleaſure which reſults from a communion of intelligent minds. He found that M. Verneuil had travelled. La Luc having aſked ſome queſtions relative to England, they fell into diſcourſe concerning the national characters of the French and Engliſh.</p>
                     <p>"If it is the privilege of wiſdom," ſaid M. Verneuil, "to look beyond happineſs, I own I had rather be without it. When we obſerve the Engliſh, their laws, writings, and converſations, and at the ſame time mark their countenances, manners, and the frequency of ſuicide among them, we are apt to believe that wiſdom and happineſs are incompatible. If, on the other hand, we turn to their neighbours, the French, and ſee <note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt be remembered that this was ſaid in the ſeventeenth century.</note> their wretched policy, their ſparking, but ſophiſtical diſcourſe, frivolous occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>o acknowledge that happineſs and folly too often dwell together."</p>
                     <p>"It is the end of wiſdom," ſaid La Luc, "to attain happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and I can hardly dignify that conduct or courſe of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:029379_0124_0FE08D9DE4EDCFC8"/>
which tends to miſery with the name of wiſdom. By this rule, perhaps, the folly, as we term it, of the French, deſerves, ſince its effect is happineſs, to be called wiſdom. That airy thoughtleſſneſs, which ſeems alike to contemn reflection and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, produces all the effect of it without reducing its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the mortification of philoſophy. But in truth wiſdom is an exertion of mind to ſubdue folly; and as the happineſs of the French is leſs the conſequence of mind than of conſtitution, it deſerves not the honours of wiſdom."</p>
                     <p>Diſcourſing on the variety of opinions that are daily formed on the ſame conduct, La Luc obſerved how much that which is commonly called opinion is the reſult of paſſion and temper.</p>
                     <p>"True," ſaid M. Verneuil, "there is a tone of thought, as there is a key note in muſic, that leads all its weaker affections. Thus where the powers of judging may be equal, the diſpoſition to judge is different, and the actions of men are at leaſt but too often arraigned by whim and caprice, by partial vanity and the humour of the moment."</p>
                     <p>Here La Luc took occaſion to reprobate the conduct of thoſe writers, who, by ſhewing the dark ſide only of human nature, and by dwelling on the evils only which are incident to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, have ſought to degrade man in his own eyes, and to make him diſcontented with life. "What ſhould we ſay of a painter," continued La Luc, "who collected in his piece ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of a black hue only, who preſented you with a black man, a black horſe, a black dog, &amp;c. &amp;c. and tells you that his is a picture of nature, and that nature is black?" "'Tis true," you would reply, "the objects you exhibit do exiſt in nature, but they form a very ſmall part of her works. You ſay that nature is black, and, to prove it, you have collected on your canvaſs all the animals of this hue that exiſt. But you have forgot to paint the green earth, the blue ſky, the white man, and objects of all thoſe various hues with which creation abounds, and of which black is a very inconſiderable part."</p>
                     <p>The countenance of M. Verneuil lightened with peculiar an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imation during the diſcourſe of La Luc. "To think well of his nature," ſaid he, "is neceſſary to the dignity and happineſs of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n. There is a decent pride which becomes every mind and is congenial to virtue. That conſciouſneſs of innate dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which ſhews him the glory of his nature, will be his beſt protection from the meanneſs of vice. Where this conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is wanting," continued M. Verneuil, "there can be no ſenſe of moral honour, and conſequently none of the higher
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029379_0125_0FE08DAAEBEEB828"/>
principles of action. What can be expected of him who ſays, it is his nature to be mean and ſelfiſh? Or who can doubt that he who thinks thus, thinks from the experience of his own heart, from the tendency of his own inclinations? Let it always be remembered, that he who would perſuade men to be good ought to ſhew them that they are great."</p>
                     <p>"You ſpeak," ſaid La Luc, "with the honeſt enthuſiaſm of a virtuous mind; and in obeying the impulſe of your heart, you utter the truths of philoſophy: and, truſt me, a bad heart and a <hi>truly</hi> philoſophic head has never yet been united in the ſame individual. Vicious inclinations not only corrupt the heart, but the underſtanding, and thus lead to falſe reaſoning. Virtue only is on the ſide of truth."</p>
                     <p>"La Luc and his gueſt, mutually pleaſed with each other, entered upon the diſcuſſion of ſubjects ſo intereſting to them both, that it was late before they parted for the night.</p>

The whole family ſympathiſed with his ſufferings, and Madame at the requeſt of M. Verneuil abandoned her balſam, and ſubſtituted an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient fomentation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:029379_0125_0FE08DAAEBEEB828"/>From an application of this he in a ſhort time, found an abatement of the pain, and returned to the breakfaſt table with greater compoſure. The happineſs which La Luc felt at ſeeing his daughter in ſafety was very apparent, but the warmth of his gratitude towards her preſerver he found it difficult to expreſs. Clara ſpoke the genuine emotions of her heart with artleſs, but modeſt, energy, and teſtified ſincere concern for the ſufferings which ſhe had occaſioned M. Verneuil.</p>
                     <p>The pleaſure received from the company of his gueſt, and the conſideration of the eſſential ſervices he had rendered him, co-operated with the natural hoſpitality of La Luc, and he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed M. Verneuil to remain ſome time at the chateau—"I can never repay the ſervices you have done me," ſaid La Luc "yet I ſeek to increaſe my obligations to you by requeſting you will prolong your viſit, and thus allow me an opportunity of culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating your acquaintance."</p>
                     <p>M. Verneuil, who at the time he met La Luc was travelling from Geneva to a diſtant part of Savoy, merely for the purpoſe of viewing the country, being now delighted with his hoſt and with every thing around him, willingly accepted the invitation. In this circumſtance prudence concurred with inclination, for to have purſued his journey on horſeback, in his preſent ſituation would have been dang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The morning was ſpent in converſation, in which M. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuil diſplayed a mind enriched with taſte, enlightened by ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and enlarged by obſervation. The ſituation of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau and the features of the ſurrounding ſcenery charmed him, and in the evening he found himſelf able to walk with La Luc and explore the beauties of this romantic region. As they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the village, the ſalutations of the peaſants, in whom love and reſpect were equally blended, and their eager inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies after Clara, bore teſtimony to the character of La Luc, while his countenance expreſſed a ſerene ſatisfaction ariſing from the conſciouſneſs of deſerving and poſſeſſing their love.— "I live ſurrounded by my children," ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"Yet the world, Sir, would call the pleaſures of which you ſpeak romantic," ſaid M. Verneuil; "for to be ſenſible of this

M. Verneuil often ſtopped in raptures, to obſerve and point out the ſingular beauties it exhibited, while La Luc, pleaſed with the delight his friend expreſſed, ſurveyed with more than uſual ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction the objects which had ſo often charmed him before. But there was a tender melancholy in the tone of his voice and his countenance which aroſe from the recollection of having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten traced thoſe ſcenes, and partook of the pleaſure they inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with her who had long ſince bade them an eternal farewell.</p>
                     <p>They preſently quitted the lake and, winding up a ſteep aſcent between the woods, came after an hour's walk, to a green ſummit, which appeared, among the ſavage rocks that environed it, like the bloſſom on the thorn. It was a ſpot formed for ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry delight, inſpiring that ſoothing tenderneſs ſo dear to the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mind, and which calls back to memory the images of paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed regret, ſoftened by diſtance and endeared by frequent reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Wild ſhrubs grew from the crivices of the rocks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and the high trees of pine and ceder that waved above, afforded a melancholy and romantic ſhade. The ſilence of the ſcene was interrupted only by the breeze, as it rolled over the woods, and by the ſolitary notes of the birds that inhabited the cliffs.</p>
                     <p>From this point the eye commanded an entire view of thoſe majeſtic and ſublime Alps, whoſe aſpect fills the ſoul with emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of indeſcribable awe, and ſeems to lift it to a nobler na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The village, and the chateau of La Luc appeared in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap>ed on their tops. All the faculties of M. Verneuil were abſorbed in admiration, and he was for ſome time quite ſilent; at length, burſting into a rhapſody, he turned, and would have addreſſed La Luc, when he perceived him at a diſtance lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ing againſt a ruſtic urn, over which drooped, in beautiful luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, the weeping willow.</p>
                     <p>As he approached, La Luc quitted his poſition, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to meet him, while M. Verneuil inquired upon what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the urn had been erected. La Luc, unable to anſwer, pointed to it, and walked ſilently away, and M. Verneuil, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the urn, read the following inſcription.</p>
                     <q>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:029379_0126_0FE08EA488B6D1D8"/>TO THE MEMORY OF CLARA LA LUC. THIS URN IS ERECTED ON THE SPOT WHICH SHE LOVED, IN TESTIMONY OF THE AFFECTION OF A HUSBAND.</q>
                     <p>M. Verneuil now comprehended the whole, and feeling for his friend, was hurt that he had noticed this monument of his grief. He rejoined La Luc, who was ſtanding on the point of the eminence contemplating the landſcape below with an air more placid, and touched with the ſweetneſs of piety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation. He perceived that M. Verneuil was ſomewhat diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted, and he ſought to remove his uneaſineſs. "You will conſider it," ſaid he, "as a mark of my eſteem that I have brought you to this ſpot. It is never prophaned by the preſence of the unfeeling. They would deride the faithfulneſs of an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment which has ſo long ſurvived its object, and which in their own breaſts, would quickly have been loſt amidſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation of general ſociety.

                     <p>"Call them not the illuſions of a viſionary brain," proceeded La Luc: "I truſt in their reality. Of this I am certain, that whether they are illuſions or not, a faith in them ought to be cheriſhed for the comfort it brings to the heart, and reverenced

                     <p>"This," ſaid M. Verneuil, "is what I have often felt, and what every ingenuous mind muſt acknowledge."</p>
                     <p>La Luc and M. Verneuil continued in converſation till the ſun had left the ſcene. The mountains, darkened by twilight, aſſumed a ſublimer aſpect, while the tops of ſome of the higheſt Alps were yet illuminated by the ſun's rays, and formed a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contraſt to the ſhadowy obſcurity of the world below<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As they deſcended through the woods, and traverſed the margin of the lake, the ſtillneſs and ſolemnity of the hour diffuſed a penſive ſweetneſs over their minds, and ſunk them into ſilence.</p>
                     <p>They found ſupper ſpread, as was uſual, in the hall, of which the windows opened upon a garden, where the flowers might be ſaid to yield their fragrance in gratitude to the refreſhing dews. The windows were embowered with eglantine and other ſweet ſhrubs, which hung in wild luxuriance around, and formed a beautiful and ſimple docoration. Clara and Adeline loved to paſs the evening in this hall, where they had acquired the firſt rudiments of aſtronomy and from which they had a wide view of the heavens. La Luc pointed out to them the planets and the fixed ſtars, explained their laws, and from thence taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to mingle moral with ſcientific inſtruction, would of ten aſcend towards that great firſt cauſe, whoſe nature ſoar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>"No ſtudy," he would ſometimes ſay, "ſo much enlarged the mind, or impreſſes it with ſo ſublime an idea of the Deity, as that of aſtronomy.

                     <p>M. Varneuil was about ſix and thirty; his figure manly, his countenance frank and engaging. A quick penetrating eye, whoſe fire was ſoftened by benevolence, diſcloſed the chief traits of his character; he was quick to diſcern, but generous to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, the follies of mankind; and while no one more ſenſibly felt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He was by birth a Frenchman. A fortune lately devolved to him, had enabled him to execute the plan which his active and inquiſitive mind had ſuggeſted, of viewing the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable parts of the continent. He was peculiarly ſuſceptible of the beautiful and ſublime in nature. To ſuch a taſte, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland and the adjacent country was, of all others, the moſt intereſting, and he found the ſcenery it exhibited infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing all that his glowing imagination had painted; he ſaw with the eye of a painter, and felt with the rapture of a poet.</p>
                     <p>In the habitation of La Luc he met with the hoſpitality, the frankneſs, and the ſimplicity, ſo characteriſtic of the country: In his venerable hoſt he ſaw the ſtrength of philoſophy united with the fineſt tenderneſs of humanity: a philoſophy which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ght him to correct his feelings, not to annihilate them; in Clara, the bloom of beauty, with the moſt perfect ſimplicity of heart; and in Adeline all the charms of elegance and grace, with a genius deſerving of the higheſt culture. In this family picture, the goodneſs of Madame La Luc was not unperceived or forgotten. The cheerfulneſs and harmony that reigned within the chateau was delightful; but the philanthropy which, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the heart of the paſtor, was diffuſed through the whole village, and united the inhabitants in the ſweet and firm bonds of ſocial compact, was divine. The beauty of its ſituation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with theſe circumſtances to make Leloncourt ſeem almoſt a Paradiſe. M. Verneuil ſighed that he muſt ſo ſoon quit it. "I ought to ſeek no farther," ſaid he, "for here wiſdom and happineſs dwell together."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="96" facs="unknown:029379_0128_0FE08DBD8267DC28"/>The admiration was reciprocal; La Luc and his family found themſelves much intereſted in M. Verneuil, and looked forward to the time of his departure with regret. So warmly they preſſed him to prolong his viſit, and ſo powerfully his own inclinations ſeconded theirs, that he accepted the invitation. La Luc omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no circumſtance which might contribute to the amuſement of his gueſt, who, having in a few days recovered the uſe of his arm, they made ſeveral excurſions among the mountains. Adeline and Clara, whom the care of Madame had reſtored to her uſual health, were generally of the party.</p>
                     <p>After ſpending a week at the chateau, M. Verneuil bade adieu to La Luc and his family; they parted with mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, and the former promiſed that when he returned to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va, he would take Leloncourt in his way. As he ſaid this, Adeline, who had for ſome time obſerved, with much alarm, La Luc's declining health, looked mournfully on his counten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and uttered a ſecret prayer that he might live to receive the viſit of M. Verneuil.</p>
                     <p>Madame was the only perſon who did not lament his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhe ſaw that the efforts of her brother to entertain his gueſt were more than his preſent ſtate of health would admit of, and ſhe rejoiced in the quiet that would now return to him.</p>
                     <p>But this quiet brought La Luc no reſpite from the illneſs; the fatigue he had ſuffered in his late excurſions ſeemed to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his diſorder, which in a ſhort time aſſumed the aſpect of a conſumption. Yielding to the ſolicitations of his family, he went to Geneva for advice, and was there recommended to try the air of Nice.</p>
                     <p>The journey thither, however, was of conſiderable length, and believing his life to be very precarious, he heſitated whether to go. He was alſo unwilling to leave the duty of his pariſh unperformed for ſo long a period as his health might require<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this was an objection which would not have withheld him from Nice, had his faith in the climate been equal to that of his phyſicians.</p>
                     <p>His pariſhioners felt the life of their paſtor to be of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſequence to them. It was a general cauſe, and they teſtified at once his worth, and their ſenſe of it, by going in a body to ſolicit him to leave them. He was much affected by this inſtance of their attachment. Such a proof of regard, joined with the entreaties of his own family, and a conſideration that for their ſakes it was a duty to endeavour to prolong his life, was too powerful to be withſtood, and he determined to ſet out for Italy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="unknown:029379_0128_0FE08DBD8267DC28"/>It was ſettled that Clara and Adeline, whoſe health La Luc thought required change of air and ſcene, ſhould accompany him, attended by the faithful Peter.</p>
                     <p>On the morning of his departure, a large body of his pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioners aſſembled round the door to bid him farewell. It was an affecting ſcene; they might meet no more. At length, wiping the tears from his eyes, La Luc ſaid, "Let us truſt in God, my friends; he has power to heal all diſorders both of body and mind. We ſhall meet again, if not in this world, I hope in a better. Let our conduct be ſuch as to enſure that better."</p>
                     <p>The ſobs of his people prevented any reply. There was ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a dry eye in the village; for there was ſcarcely an inhabitant of it that was not now aſſembled in the preſence of La Luc. He ſhook hands with them all, "Farewell, my friends," ſaid he, "we ſhall meet again." "God grant we may," ſaid they with one voice of fervent petition.</p>
                     <p>Having mounted his horſe, and Clara and Adeline being ready, they took a laſt leave of Madame La Luc, and quitted the chateau. The people unwilling to leave La Luc, the greater part of them accompanied him to ſome diſtance from the village. As he moved ſlowly on he caſt a laſt lingering look at his little home, where he had ſpent ſo many peaceful years, and which he now gazed on, perhaps for the laſt time, and tears roſe to his eyes; but he checked them. Every ſcene of the adjacent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try called up, as he paſſed, ſome tender remembrance. He looked towards the ſpot conſecrated to the memory of his deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wife; the dewy vapours of the morning veiled it. La Luc felt the diſappointment more deeply, perhaps, than reaſon could juſtify; but thoſe who know from experience how much the imagination loves to dwell on any object, however remotely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with that of our tenderneſs, will feel with him. This was an object round which the affections of La Luc had ſettled themſelves; it was a memorial to the eye, and the view of it awakened more forcibly in the memory every tender idea that could aſſociate with the primary ſubject of his regard. In ſuch caſes fancy gives to the illuſions of ſtrong affection, the ſtamp of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and they are cheriſhed by the heart with romantic fondneſs.</p>
                     <p>His people accompanied him for near a mile from the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and could ſcarcely then be prevailed on to leave him; at length he once more bade them farewell, and went on his way, followed by their prayers and bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>La Luc and his little party travelled ſlowly on, ſunk in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſilence—a ſilence too pleaſingly ſad to be ſoon relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:029379_0129_0FE08DC2843B38B0"/>
and which they indulged without fear of interruption. The ſolitary grandeur of the ſcenes through which they paſſed, and the ſoothing murmur of the pines that waved above, aided this ſoft luxury of meditation.</p>
                     <p>They proceeded by eaſy ſtages; and after travelling for ſome days among the romantic mountains and green vallies of Piedmont, they entered the rich country of Nice. The gay and luxuriant views which now opened upon the travellers as they wound among the hills, appeared like ſcenes of fairy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, or thoſe produced by the lonely viſions of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets. While the ſpiral ſummits of the mountains exhibited the ſnowy ſeverity of winter, the pine, the cypreſs, the olive and the myrtle ſhaded their ſides with the green tints of ſpring, and groves of orange, lemon, and citron, ſpread over their feet the full glow of autumn. As they advanced the ſcenery became ſtill more diverſified; and at length, between the receding heights, Adeline caught a glimpſe of the diſtant waters of the Mediterranean, fading into the blue and cloudleſs horizon. She had never till now ſeen the ocean; and this tranſient view of it rouſed her imagination, and made her watch impatiently for a nearer proſpect.</p>
                     <p>It was towards the cloſe of day when the travellers winding round an abrupt projection of that range of Alps which crowns the amphitheatre that environs Nice, looked down upon the green hills that ſtretch to the ſhores, on the city, and its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient caſtle, and on the wide waters of the Mediterranean; with the mountains of Corſica in the fartheſt diſtance. Such a ſweep of ſea and land, ſo varied with the gay the magnificent, and the awful, would have fixed an eye in admiration:—for Adeline and Clara novelty and enthuſiaſm added their charms to the proſpect. The ſoft and ſalubrious air ſeemed to welcome La Luc to this ſmiling region, and the ſerene atmoſphere to promiſe invariable ſummer. They at length deſcended upon the little plain where ſtands the city of Nice, and which was the moſt extenſive piece of level ground they had paſſed ſince they entered the country. Here in the boſom of the mountains, ſheltered from the north and the eaſt, where the weſtern gales alone ſeemed to breathe, all the blooms of ſpring and the riches of autumn were united. Trees of myrtle bordered the road, which wound among groves of orange, lemon and bergamot whoſe delicious fragrance come to the ſenſe mingled with the breath of roſes and carnations that bloſſomed in their ſhade. The gently ſwelling hills that roſe from the plain were covered
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:029379_0129_0FE08DC2843B38B0"/>
with vines, and crowned with cypreſſes, olives and date trees; beyond, there appeared the ſweep of lofty mountains whence the travellers had deſcended, and whence roſe the little river Paglion, ſwoln by the ſnows that melt on their ſummits, and which, after meandering through the plain, waſhes the walls of Nice, where it falls into the Mediterranean. In this blooming region, Adeline obſerved that the countenances of the peaſants, meagre and diſcontented, formed, a melancholy contraſt, to the face of the country, and ſhe lamented again the effects of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary government, where the bounties of nature, which were deſigned for all, are monopolized by a few, and the many are ſuffered to ſtarve tantalized by ſurrounding plenty.</p>
                     <p>The city loſt much of its enchantment on a nearer approach: its narrow ſtreets and ſhabby houſes but ill anſwered the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation which a diſtant view of its ramparts and its harbour gay with veſſels ſeemed to authoriſe. The appearance of the inn at which La Luc now alighted did not contribute to ſoften his diſappointment; but if he was ſupriſed to find ſuch indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent accommodation at the inn of a town celebrated as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of valetudinarians, he was ſtill more ſo when he learned the difficulty of procuring furniſhed lodgings.</p>
                     <p>After much ſearch he procured apartments in a ſmall but pleaſant houſe, ſituated a little way out of the town: it had a garden, and a terrace which overlooked the ſea, and was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by an air of neatneſs very unuſual in the houſes of Nice. He agreed to board with the family, whoſe table like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe accommodated a gentleman and lady, their lodgers, and thus he became a temporary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>On the following morning Adeline roſe at an early hour, eager to indulge the new and ſublime emotion with which a view of the ocean inſpired her, and walked with Clara towards the hills that afforded a more extenſive proſpect. They purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their way for ſome time between high embowering banks, till they arrived at an eminence, whence
<q>"Heaven, earth, ocean, ſmil'd!"</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>They ſat down on a rock, overſhadowed by lofty palm-trees, to contemplate at leiſure the magnificent ſcene. The ſun was juſt emerged from the ſea, over which his rays ſhed a flood of light, and darted a thouſand brilliant tints on the vapours that aſcended the horizon, and floated there in light clouds, leaving the boſom of the waters below clear as chryſtal, except where the white ſurges were ſeen to beat upon the rocks; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the diſtant ſails of the fiſhing boats, and the far diſtant

highlands of Corſica, tinted with aetherial blue. Clara, after ſome time, drew forth her pencel, but threw it aſide in deſpair. Adeline as they returned home threw a romantic glen, when her ſenſes were no longer abſorbed in the contemplation of this grand ſcenery, and when its images floated on her memory, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in ſoftened colours, repeated the following lines:

                     <p>La Luc in his walks met with ſome ſenſible and agreeable companions, who like himſelf came to Nice in ſearch of health. Of theſe he ſoon formed a ſmall but pleaſant ſociety, among whom was a Frenchman, whoſe wild manners marked with a deep and intereſting melancholy, had particularly attracted La Luc. He very ſeldom mentioned himſelf, or any circumſtance that might lead to a knowledge of his family, but on other ſubjects converſed with frankneſs and much intelligence. La Luc had frequently invited him to his lodgings, but he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways declined the invitation, and this in a manner ſo gentle as to diſarm diſpleaſure, and convince La Luc that his refuſal was the conſequence of a certain dejection of mind which made him reluctant to meet other ſtrangers.</p>
                     <p>The deſcription which La Luc had given of this foreigner had excited the curioſity of Clara; and the ſympathy which the unfortunate feel for each other called forth the commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Adeline; for that he was unfortunate ſhe could not doubt. On their return from an evening walk La Luc pointed out the chevalier, and quickened his pace to overtake him.

Adeline received him with a ſoft ſmile, but endeavoured to reſtrain the expreſſion of pity which her features had involuntarily aſſumed; ſhe wiſhed him not to know that ſhe obſerved he was unhappy.</p>
                     <p>After this interview he no longer rejected the invitations of La Luc, but made him frequent viſits, and often accompanied Adeline and Clara in their rambles. The mild and ſenſible converſation of the former ſeemed to ſooth his mind, and in her preſence, he frequently converſed with a degree of anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which La Luc till then had not obſerved in him. Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line too derived from the ſimilarity of their taſte, and his intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent converſation, a degree of ſatisfaction which contributed, with the compaſſion his dejection inſpired, to win her converſation, and ſhe converſed with an eaſy frankneſs rather unuſual to her.</p>
                     <p>His viſits ſoon became more frequent. He walked with La Luc and his family; he attended them on their little excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to view thoſe magnificent remains of Roman antiquity which enrich the neighbourhood of Nice. When the ladies ſat at home and worked, he enlivened the hours by reading to them, and they had the pleaſure to obſerve his ſpirits ſomewhat relieved from the heavy melancholy that had oppreſſed him.</p>
                     <p>M. Amand was paſſionately fond of muſic. Clara had not forgot to bring her beloved lute: he would ſometimes ſtrike the chords in the moſt ſweet and mournful ſymphonies, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could be prevailed on to play. When Adeline or Clara played, he would ſit in deep reverie, and loſt to every object around him, except when he fixed his eyes in mournful gaze on Adeline, and a ſigh would ſometimes eſcape him.</p>
                     <p>One evening Adeline having excuſed herſelf from accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying La Luc and Clara in a viſit to a neighbouring family, ſhe returned to the terrace of the garden, which overlooked the ſea, and as ſhe viewed the tranquil ſplendour of the ſitting ſun, and his glories reflected on the poliſhed ſurface of the waves, ſhe touched the ſtrings of the lute in ſofteſt harmony, her voice accompanying it with words which ſhe had one day written af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having read that rich effuſion of Shakeſpeare's genius, "A midſummer Night's dream."</p>

In a few moments he returned, with a compoſed and ſoftened countenance. "Forgive this abrupt conduct," ſaid he; "I know not how to apologize for it but by owning its cauſe. When I tell you, Madame, that my tears flow to the memory of a lady who ſtrongly reſembled you, and who is loſt to me for ever, you will know how to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

me."—His voice faultered, and he pauſed. Adeline was ſilent. "The lute" he reſumed "was her favourite inſtrument, and when you touched it with ſuch melancholy expreſſion, I ſaw her very image before me. But alas! why do I diſtreſs you with a knowledge of my ſorrows! ſhe is gone, and never to return! And you, Adeline—you"—He checked his ſpeech; and Adeline, turning on him a look of mournful regard, obſerved a wildneſs in his eyes which alarmed her. "Theſe recollections are too painful," ſaid ſhe in a gentle voice; "let us return to the houſe; M. La Luc is probably come home"—"O no!" replied M. Amand; "No—this breeze refreſhes me. How often at this hour have I talked with <hi>her,</hi> as I now talk with you!—Such were the ſoft tones of her voice—ſuch the ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expreſſion of her countenance."—Adeline interrupted him. "Let me beg of you to conſider your health—this dewy air cannot be good for invalids." He ſtood with his hands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

"Muſt I leave you here?" ſaid ſhe, ſmiling, and ſtanding in an attitude to depart—"I entreat you to play again the air I heard juſt now," ſaid M. Amand in a hurried voice. "Certainly!" and ſhe immediately began to play. He leaned againſt a palm tree in an attitude of deep at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and as the ſounds languiſhed on the air, his features gradually loſt their wild expreſſion, and he melted into tears. He continued to weep ſilently till the ſong concluded, and it was ſome time before he recovered his voice enough to ſay, "Adeline, I cannot thank you for this goodneſs. My mind has recovered its bias, you have ſoothed a broken heart. Increaſe the kindneſs you have ſhewn me by promiſing never to mention what you have witneſſed this evening, and I will endeavour never again to wound your ſenſibility by a ſimilar offence."—Adeline gave the required promiſe; and M. Amand, preſſing her hand, with a melancholy ſmile, hurried from the garden, and ſhe ſaw him no more that night.</p>
                     <p>La Luc had been near a fortnight at Nice, and his health, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of amending, ſeemed rather to decline, yet he wiſhed to make a longer experiment of the climate.

diſſipate the ſick langour of melancholy. Company, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling her to withdraw her attention from the ſubject of her ſorrow, afforded her tranſient relief, but the violence of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion generally left her more depreſſed. It was in the ſtillneſs of ſolitude, in the tranquil obſervance of beautiful nature, that her mind recovered its tone, and indulging the penſive inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now become habitual to it, was ſoothed and fortified. Of all the grand objects which nature had exhibited, the ocean in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired her with the moſt ſublime admiration. She loved to wander alone on its ſhores, and when ſhe could eſcape ſo long from the duties or the forms of ſociety, ſhe would ſit for hours on the beach watching the rolling waves, and liſtening to their dying murmur, till her ſoftened fancy recalled long loſt ſcenes and reſtored the image of Theodore, when tears of deſpondency too often followed thoſe of pity and regret. But theſe viſions of memory, painful as they were, no longer excited that frenzy o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To theſe ſolitary indulgencies generally ſucceeded calmneſs, and what Adeline endeavoured to believe was reſignation.</p>

Every object then ſmiled in freſh and lively colours. The blue ſea, the brilliant ſky, the diſtant fiſhing boats, with their white ſails and the voices of the fiſhermen borne at intervals on the air, were circumſtances which re-animated her ſpirits and in one of her rambles yielding to that taſte for poetry which had ſeldom for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken her, ſhe repeated the following lines.</p>

                     <p>During ſeveral days ſucceeding that on which M. Amand had diſcloſed the cauſe of his melancholy, he did not viſit La Luc. At length Adeline met him in one of her ſolitary ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles on the ſhore. He was pale and dejected, and ſeemed much agitated when he obſerved her; ſhe therefore endeavoured to avoid him, but he advanced with quickened ſteps and accoſted her. He ſaid it was his intention to leave Nice in a few days. "I have found no benefit from the climate," added M. Amand; "Alas! what climate can relieve the ſickneſs of the heart! I go to loſe in the varieties of new ſcenes the remembrance of paſt happineſs; yet the effort is vain; I am every where equally reſtleſs and unhappy." Adeline tried to encourage him to hope much from time and change of place. "Time <hi>will</hi> blunt the ſharpeſt edge of ſorrow," ſaid ſhe; "I know it from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence." Yet while ſhe ſpoke, the tears in her eyes contradicted the aſſertion of her lips. "You have been unhappy, Adeline!— Yes—I knew it from the firſt. The ſmile of pity which you gave me, aſſured me that you knew what it was to ſuffer." The deſponding air with which he ſpoke renewed her apprehenſion of a ſcene ſimilar to the one ſhe had lately witneſſed, and ſhe changed the ſubject, but he ſoon returned to it. "You bid me hope <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uch from time! My wife! My dear wife!"—his tong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> faultered—"It is now many months ſince I loſt her— yet the moment of her death ſeems but as yeſterday." Adeline faintly ſmiled. "You can ſcarcely judge of the effect of time yet, you have much to hope for." He ſhook his head. "But I am again intruding my misfortunes on your notice; forgive this perpetual egotiſm. There is a comfort in the pity of the good, ſuch as nothing elſe can impart; this muſt plead my excuſe; may you, Adeline, never want it. Ah! thoſe tears—" Adeline haſtily dried them. M. Amand forbore to preſs the ſubject, and immediately began to converſe on indifferent topics. They returned towards the chateau, but La Luc being from home M. Amand took leave at the door. Adeline retired to her chamber, oppreſſed by her own ſorrows, and thoſe of her amiable friend.</p>
                     <p>Near three weeks had now elapſed at Nice, during which the diſorder of La Luc ſeemed rather to increaſe than to abate, when his phyſician very honeſtly confeſſed the little hope he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:029379_0134_0FE08DEECC776418"/>
from the climate, and adviſed him to try the effect of a ſea voyage, adding, that if the experiment failed, even the air of Montpellier appeared to him more likely to afford relief than that of Nice. La Luc received this diſintereſted advice with a mixture of gratitude and diſappointment. The circumſtances which had made him reluctant to quit Savoy, rendered him yet more ſo to protract his abſcence, and increaſe his expenſes; but the ties of affection that bound him to his family, and the love of life, which ſo ſeldom leave, us, again prevailed over inferior conſiderations, and he determined to coaſt the Mediterranean as far as Languedoc, where, if the voyage did not anſwer his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, he would land and proceed to Montpellier.</p>
                     <p>When M. Amand learned that La Luc deſigned to quit Nice in a few days, he determined not to leave it before him. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this interval he had not ſufficient reſolution to deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the frequent converſation of Adeline, though her preſence, by reminding him of his loſt wife, gave him more pain than comfort. He was the ſecond ſon of a French gentleman of fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, and had been married about a year to a lady to whom he had long been attached when ſhe died in her lying-in. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſoon followed its mother, and left the diſconſolate father abandoned to grief, which had preyed ſo heavily on his health, that his phyſician thought it neceſſary to ſend him to Nice. From the air of Nice, however, he had derived no benefit, and he now determined to travel father into Italy, though he no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger felt any intereſt in thoſe charming ſcenes which in happier days, and with her whom he never ceaſed to lament, would have afforded him the higheſt degree of mental luxury—now he ſought only to eſcape from himſelf, or rather from the image of her who had once conſtituted his trueſt happineſs.</p>
                     <p>La Luc having laid his plan, hired a ſmall veſſel, and in a few days embarked, with a ſick hope bidding adieu to the ſhores of Italy and the towering Alps, and ſeeking on a new element the health which had hitherto mocked his purſuit.</p>
                     <p>M. Amand took a melancholy leave of his new friends, whom he attended to the ſea ſide. When he aſſiſted Adeline on board his heart was too full to ſuffer him to ſay farewell; but he ſtood long on the beach purſuing with his eyes her courſe over the waters, and waving his hands, till tears dimmid his ſight. The breeze wafted the veſſel gently from the coaſt, and Adeline <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> herſelf ſurrounded by the undulating waves of the ocean. The ſhore appeared to recede, its mountains to leſſen, the gay colour of its landſcape to melt into each other, and in a ſhort time the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:029379_0134_0FE08DEECC776418"/>
figure of M. Amand was ſeen no more: the town of Nice, with its caſtle and harbour, next faded away in diſtance, and the purple tint of the mountains was at length all that remained on the verge of the horizon. She ſighed as ſhe gazed, and her eyes filled with tears. "So vaniſhed my proſpect of happineſs," ſaid ſhe; "and my future view is like the waſte of waters that ſurround me." Her heart was full, and ſhe retired from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to a remote part of the deck, where ſhe indulged her tears as ſhe watched the veſſel cut its way through the liquid glaſs. The water was ſo tranſparent that ſhe ſaw the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams playing at a conſiderable depth, and fiſh of various col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours glance athwart the current. Innumerable marine plants ſpread their vigorous leaves on the rocks below, and the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their verdure formed a beautiful contraſt to the glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcarlet of the coral that branched beſide them.</p>
                     <p>The diſtant coaſt, at length, entirely diſappeared. Adeline gazed with an emotion the moſt ſublime, on the boundleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of waters that ſpread on all ſides: ſhe ſeemed as if launched into a new world, the grandeur and immenſity of the view aſtoniſhed and overpowered her: for a moment ſhe doubted the truth of the compaſs, and believed it to be almoſt impoſſible for the veſſel to find its way over the pathleſs waters to any ſhore. And when ſhe conſidered that a plank alone ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated her from death, a ſenſation of unmixed terror ſuperſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that of ſublimity, and ſhe haſtily turned her eyes from the proſpect, and her thoughts from the ſubject.</p>

whither Clara attended him. The pilot at the helm, guiding the ſmall veſſel through the ſounding waters, and one ſolitary ſailor, leaning with croſſed arms againſt the maſt, and now and then ſinging parts of a mournful ditty, were all of the crew except Adeline that remained upon deck—and Adeline ſilently watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the declining ſun, which threw a ſaffron glow upon the waves, and on the ſails, gently ſwelling in the breeze that was now dying away. The ſun, at length, ſunk below the ocean, and twilight ſtole over the ſcene, leaving the ſhadowy ſhores yet viſible, and touching with a ſolemn tint the waters that ſtretched wide around. She ſketched the picture, but it was with a faint pencil.</p>

She then, as now, had watched the fall of evening and the fading proſpect, and ſhe remembered what a deſolate feeling had accompanied the impreſſion which thoſe objects made. She had then no friends—no aſylum—no certainty of
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029379_0135_0FE08DF4F0444708"/>
eſcaping the purſuit of her enemy. Now ſhe had found affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate friends—a ſecure retreat—and was delivered from the terrors ſhe then ſuffered—but ſtill ſhe was unhappy. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Theodore—of Theodore who had loved her ſo truly, who had encountered and ſuffered ſo much for her ſake, and of whoſe fate ſhe was now as ignorant as when ſhe traverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rhone, was an inceſſant pang to her heart. She ſeemed to be more remote than ever from the poſſibility of hearing of him. Sometimes a faint hope croſſed her that he had eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the malice of his perſecutor; but when ſhe conſidered the inveteracy and power of the latter, and the henious light in which the law regards an aſſault upon a ſuperior officer, even this poor hope vaniſhed, and left her to tears and anguiſh, ſuch as this reverie, which began with a ſenſation of only gentle melancholy, now led to. She continued to muſe till the moon aroſe from the boſom of the ocean, and ſhed her trembling luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre upon the waves, diffuſing peace, and making ſilence more ſolemn; beaming a ſoft light on the white ſails, and throwing upon the waters the tall ſhadow of the veſſel, which now ſeemed to glide along unoppoſed by any current. Her tears had ſomewhat relieved the anguiſh of her mind, and ſhe again repoſed in placed melancholy, when a ſtrain of ſuch tender and entrancing ſweetneſs ſtole on the ſilence of the hour, that it ſeemed more like celeſtial than mortal muſic—ſo ſoft, ſo ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it ſunk upon her ear, that it recalled her from miſery to hope and love. She wept again—but theſe were tears which ſhe would not have exchanged for mirth and joy. She looked around, but perceived neither ſhip or boat; and as the undula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſounds ſwelled in the diſtant air, ſhe thought they came from the ſhore. Sometimes the breeze wafted them away, and again returned them in tones of the moſt languiſhing ſoftneſs. The links of the air thus broken it was muſic rather than mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ody that ſhe caught, till, the pilot gradually ſteering nearer the coaſt, ſhe diſtinguiſhed the notes of a ſong familiar to her ear. She endeavoured to recollect where ſhe had heard it, but in vain; yet her heart beat almoſt unconſciouſly with a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſembling hope. Still ſhe liſtened, till the breeze again ſtole the ſounds. With regret ſhe now perceived that the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel was moving from them, and at length they trembled faintly on the waves, ſunk away at a diſtance, and were heard no more. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Rhone, however, was the only one of much conſequence which he paſſed. On this object, though it was ſo diſtant that fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, perhaps, rather than the ſenſe, beheld it, Clara gazed with peculiar pleaſure, for it came from the banks of Savoy, and the wave which ſhe thought ſhe perceived, had waſhed the feet of her dear native mountains. The time paſſed with mingled pleaſure and improvement as La Luc deſcribed to his attentive pupils the manners and commerce of the different inhabitants of the coaſt, and the natural hiſtory of the country, or as he tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in imagination the remote wanderings of rivers to their ſource, and delineated the characteriſtic beauties of their ſcenery.</p>
                     <p>After a pleaſant voyage of a few days, the ſhores of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence receded, and that of Languedoc, which had long bounded the diſtance, became the grand object of the ſcene, and the ſailors drew near their port.

Often as ſhe went ſhe turned her eyes to catch between the dark foliage the blue waters of the bay, the white ſail that flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by, and the trembling gleam of the ſitting ſun.

The ſea alone reflected the fading ſplendour of the weſt; its tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil ſurface was partially diſturbed by the low wind that crept in tremulous lines along the waters, whence riſing to the woods, it ſhivered their light leaves, and died away.

                     <p>The ſpreading duſk at length reminded Adeline of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the inn, and that ſhe had her way to find through a
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:029379_0137_0FE08E061A073540"/>
wild and lonely wood: ſhe bade adieu to the ſyren that had ſo long detained her, and purſued the path with quick ſteps. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed it for ſometime, ſhe became bewildered among the thickets, and the increaſing darkneſs did not allow her to judge of the direction ſhe was in. Her apprehenſions heightened her difficulties: ſhe thought ſhe diſtinguiſhed the voices of men at ſome little diſtance, and ſhe increaſed her ſpeed till ſhe found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the ſea ſands over which the woods impeded. Her breath was now exhauſted—ſhe pauſed a moment to recover herſelf, and fearfully liſtened; but, inſtead of the voices of men, ſhe heard faintly ſwelling in the breeze the notes of mournful muſic. Her heart, ever ſenſible to the impreſſions of melody, melted with the tones, and her fears were for a moment lulled in ſweet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment. Surpriſe was ſoon mingled with delight, when, as the ſounds advanced, ſhe diſtinguiſhed the tone of that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the melody of that well known air, ſhe had heard a few preceding evenings from the ſhores of Provence. But ſhe had no time for conjecture—footſteps approached, and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed her ſpeed. She was now emerged from the darkneſs of the woods, and the moon, which ſhone bright, exhibited along the level ſands the town and port in the diſtance. The ſteps that had followed, now came up with her, and ſhe perceived two men, but they paſſed in converſation without noticing her, and as they paſſed ſhe was certain ſhe recollected the voice of him who was then ſpeaking. Its tones were ſo familiar to her ear, that ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> ſurpriſed at the imperfect memory which did not ſuffer her to be aſſured by whom they were uttered. Another ſtep now followed, and a rude voice called her to ſtop. As ſhe haſtily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rned her eyes ſhe ſaw imperfectly by the moonlight a man in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lor's habit purſuing, while he renewed the call. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by terror, ſhe fled along the ſands, but her ſteps were ſhort and trembling, thoſe of her purſuer's ſtrong and quick.</p>
                     <p>She had juſt ſtrength ſufficient to reach the men who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſſed her, and to implore their protection, when her purſuer came up with them, but ſuddenly turned into the woods on the left, and diſappeared.</p>
                     <p>She had no breath to anſwer the inquiries of the ſtrangers who ſupported her, till a ſudden exclamation, and the ſound of her own name drew her eyes attentively upon the perſon who utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and in the rays which ſhone ſtrong upon his features, ſhe diſtinguiſhed M. Verneuil! Mutual ſatisfaction and expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation enſued, and when he learned that La Luc and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were at the inn, he felt an increaſed pleaſure in conducting
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029379_0138_0FE08E10B21D25B8"/>
her thither. He ſaid that he had accidentally met with an old friend in Savoy, whom he now introduced by the name of Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and who had prevailed on him to change his route and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him to the ſhores of the Mediterranean. They had embarked from the coaſt of Provence only a few preceding days, and had that evening landed in Languedoc on the eſtate of M. Mauron. Adeline had now no doubt that it was the flute of M. Verneuil, and which had ſo often delighted her at Leloncourt, that ſhe had heard on the ſea.</p>
                     <p>When they reached the inn they found La Luc under great anxiety for Adeline, in ſearch of whom he had ſent ſeveral peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Anxiety yielded to ſurpriſe and pleaſure, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her with M. Verneuil, whoſe eyes beamed with unuſual animation on ſeeing Clara. After mutual congratulations, M. Verneuil obſerved, and lamented, the very indifferent accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation which the inn afforded his friends, and M. Mauron immediately invited them to his chateau with a warmth of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality that overcame every ſcruple which delicacy or pride could oppoſe. The woods that Adeline had traverſed formed a part of his demeſne, which extended almoſt to the inn; but he inſiſted that his carriage ſhould take his gueſts to the chateau, and departed to give orders for their reception. The preſence of M. Verneuil, and the kindneſs of his friends, gave La Luc an unuſual flow of ſpirits; he converſed with a degree of vigour and livelineſs to which he had long been unaccuſtomed, and the ſmile of ſatisfaction that Clara gave to Adeline <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſſed how much ſhe thought he was already benefited by the voyage. Adeline anſwered her look with a ſmile of leſs confidence, for ſhe attributed his preſent animation to a more temporary cauſe.</p>
                     <p>About half an hour after the departure of M. Mauron, a boy who ſerved as waiter, brought a meſſage from a chevalier then at the inn, requeſting to ſpeak with Adeline. The man who had purſued her along the ſands inſtantly occurred to her, and ſhe ſcarcely doubted that the ſtranger was ſome perſon belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Marquis de Montalt, perhaps the Marquis himſelf, though that he ſhould have diſcovered her accidentally, in ſo obſcure a place, and ſo immediately upon her arrival, ſeemed very improbable. With trembling lips, and a countenance as pale as death, ſhe inquired the name of the chevalier. The boy was not acquainted with it. La Luc aſked what ſort of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he was; but the boy, who underſtood little of the art of deſcribing, gave ſuch a confuſed account of him, that Adeline could only learn that he was not large, but of the middle ſtatu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="117" facs="unknown:029379_0138_0FE08E10B21D25B8"/>
This circumſtance, however, convincing her that it was not the Marquis de Montalt who deſired to ſee her, ſhe aſked whether it would be agreeable to La Luc to have the ſtranger admitted. La Luc ſaid, "By all means;" and the waiter withdrew. Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſat in trembling expectation till the door opened, and Louis de la Motte entered the room. He advanced with an embaraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and melancholy air, though his countenance had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened with a momentary pleaſure when he firſt beheld Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line: Adeline who was ſtill the idol of his heart. After the firſt ſalutations were over, all apprehenſions of the Marquis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now diſſipated, ſhe inquired when Louis had ſeen Monſieur and Madame La Motte.</p>
                     <p>"I ought rather to aſk you that queſtion," ſaid Louis, "in ſome confuſion, for I believe you have ſeen them ſince I have; and the pleaſure of meeting you thus is equalled by my ſurpriſe. I have not heard from my father for ſometime, owing probably to my regiment being removed to new quarters."</p>
                     <p>He looked as if he wiſhed to be informed with whom Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line now was; but as this was a ſubject upon which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſhe could ſpeak in the preſence of La Luc, ſhe led the converſation to general topics, after having ſaid that Monſieur and Madame La Motte were well when ſhe left them. Louis ſpoke little, and often looked anxiouſly at Adeline, while his mind ſeemed labouring under ſtrong oppreſſion. She obſerved this, and recollecting the declaration he had made her on the morning of his departure from the Abbey, ſhe attributed his preſent embarraſſment to the effect of a paſſion yet unſubdued, and did not appear to notice it. After he had ſat near a quarter of an hour, under a ſtruggle of feelings which he could neither conquer or conceal, he roſe to leave the room, and as he paſſed Adeline, ſaid, in a low voice, "do permit me to ſpeak with you alone for five minutes." She heſitated in ſome confuſion, and then ſaying there were none but friends preſent, begged he would be ſeated.—"Excuſe me," ſaid he, in the ſame low accent; "What I would ſay nearly concerns you, and you only. "Do favour me with a few moments attention." He ſaid this with a look that ſurpriſed her; and having ordered candles in another room, ſhe went thither.</p>
                     <p>Louis ſat for ſome moments ſilent, and ſeemingly in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of mind. At length he ſaid, "I know not whether to rejoice or to lament at this unexpected meeting, though, if you are in ſafe hands, I ought certainly to rejoice, however hard the taſk that now falls to my lot. I am not ignorant of the

                     <p>"It is indeed of importance," replied Louis; "yet I know not how to mention it, how to ſoften—This taſk is to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere. Alas! my poor friend!"</p>
                     <p>"Who is it you ſpeak of, Sir," ſaid Adeline, with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Louis roſe from his chair, and walked about the room. "I would prepare you for what I have to ſay." he reſumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "but upon my ſoul I am not equal to it."</p>
                     <p>"I entreat you to keep me no longer in ſuſpenſe," ſaid Adeline, who had a wild idea that it was Theodore he would ſpeak of. Louis ſtill heſitated. "Is it—O is it?—I conjure you tell me the worſt at once," ſaid ſhe, in a voice of agony. "I can bear it—indeed I can."</p>
                     <p>"My unhappy friend!" exclaimed Louis, "O Theodore!" Theodore!" faintly articulated Adeline, "he lives then!"— "He does," ſaid Louis, "but"—He ſtopped.—"But what?" cried Adeline, trembling violently; "If he is living you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell me worſe than my fears ſuggeſt; I entreat you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to heſitate."—Louis reſumed his ſeat, and endeavouring to aſſume a collected air, ſaid, he is living, Madame, but he is a priſoner, and—for why ſhould I deceive you? I fear he has lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to hope in this world."</p>
                     <p>"I have long feared ſo, Sir," ſaid Adeline, in a voice of forced compoſure; "you have ſomething more terrible than this to relate, and I again intreat you will explain yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"He has every thing to apprehend from the Marquis de Montalt," ſaid Louis. "Alas! why do I ſay to apprehend! His judgment is already fixed—he is condemned to die."</p>
                     <p>At this confirmation of her fears a death-like paleneſs diffuſed itſelf over the countenance of Adeline; ſhe ſat motionleſs, and attempted to ſigh, but ſeemed almoſt ſuffocated. Terrified <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>At length a ſenſe of the approaching ſufferings of the good La Luc overcoming every other feeling, Adeline recovered ſtrength of mind ſufficient to try to ſoften the intelligence Louis had to communicate, and to conduct Clara to another room. Here ſhe collected reſolution to tell her, and with much tender conſideration, the circumſtances of her brother's ſituation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing only her knowledge of his ſentence being already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. This relation neceſſarily included the mention of their attachment, and in the friend of her heart Clara diſcovered the innocent cauſe of her brother's deſtruction. Adeline alſo learned ſhe occaſion of that circumſtance which had contributed to keep her ignorant of Theodore's relationſhip to La Luc; ſhe was told the former had taken the name of Peyrou, with an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate which had been left him about a year before by a relation of his mother's upon that condition. Theodore had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the church, but his diſpoſition inclined him to a more active life than the clerical, habit would admit of, and on his acceſſion to this eſtate he had entered into the ſervice of the French King.</p>
                     <p>In the few and interrupted interviews, which had been allowed them at Caux, Theodore had mentioned his family to Adeline only in general terms, and thus, when they were ſo ſuddenly ſeparated, had, without deſigning it left her in ignorance of his father's name and place of reſidence.</p>
                     <p>The ſacredneſs and delicacy of Adeline's grief, which had never permitted her to mention the ſubject of it even to Clara, had ſince contributed to deceive her.</p>
                     <p>The diſtreſs of Clara, on learning the ſituation of her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could endure no reſtraint; Adeline, who had comma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

While they wept forth the anguiſh of their hearts, a ſcene, if poſſible, more affecting paſſed between La Luc and Louis, who perceived it was neceſſary to inform him, though cautio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and by degrees, of the ſoft extent of his calamity. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told La Luc, that though Theodore had been firſt tried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the offence of having quitted his poſt, he was now condemned on a charge of aſſault made upon his general officer, the Marquis de Montalt, who had brought witneſſes to prove that his life had been endangered by the circumſtance; and who having purſued the proſecution with the moſt bitter rancour, had at length obtained the ſentence which the law could not withhold, but which every other officer in the regiment deplored.</p>
                     <p>Louis added, that the ſentence was to be executed in leſs than a fortnight, and that Theodore being very unhappy at re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving no anſwers to the letters he had ſent his father, wiſhing to ſee him once more, and knowing that there was now no time to be loſt, had requeſted him to go to Leloncourt, and acquaint his father with his ſituation.</p>
                     <p>La Luc received the account of his ſon's condition with a diſtreſs that admitted neither of tears or complaint. He aſked where Theodore was, and deſiring to be conducted to him, he thanked Louis for all his kindneſs, and ordered poſt horſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
                     <p>A carriage was ſoon ready, and this unhappy, father, after taking a mournful leave of M. Verneuil, and ſending a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to M. Mauron, attended by his family, ſet out for the priſon of his ſon. The journey was a ſilent one; each indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual of the party endeavoured, in conſideration of each other, to ſuppreſs the expreſſion of grief, but was unable to do more. La Luc appeared calm and complacent; he ſeemed frequently to be engaged in prayer; but a ſtruggle for reſignation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure was ſometimes viſible upon his countenance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the efforts of his mind.</p>

                     <p>WE now return to the Marquis de Montalt, who having ſeen La Motte ſafely lodged in the priſon of D—y, and learning the trial would not come on immediately, had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his villa on the borders of the foreſt, where he expected to hear news of Adeline. It had been his intention to follow his ſervants to Lyons; but he now determined to wait a few days for letters, and he had little doubt that Adeline, ſince her flight had been ſo quickly purſued, would be overtaken, and probably before ſhe could reach that city. In this expectation
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029379_0141_0FE08E2942E52660"/>
he had been miſerably diſappointed; for his ſervants informed him, that though they traced her thither, they had neither been able to follow her route beyond, nor to diſcover her at Lyons. This eſcape ſhe probably owed to having embarked on the Rhone, for it does not appear that the Marquis's people thought of ſeeking her on the courſe of that river.</p>
                     <p>His preſence was ſoon after required at Vaceau<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the court martial was then ſitting; thither, therefore, he went with paſſions ſtill more exaſperated by his late diſappointment, and procured the conde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nation of Theodore. The ſentence was univerſally lamented, for Theodore was much beloved in his reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment; and the occaſion of the Marquis's perſonal reſentment towards him being known, every heart was intereſted in his cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Louis de la Motte happening at this time to be ſtationed in the ſame town, heard an imperfect account of his ſtory, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced that the priſoner was the young chevalier whom he had formerly ſeen with the Marquis at the Abbey, he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, partly from compaſſion, and partly with a hope of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his parents, to viſit him. The compaſſionate ſympathy which Louis expreſſed, and the zeal with which he tendered his ſervices, affected Theodore, and excited in him a warm return of friendſhip. Louis made him frequent viſits, did every thing that kindneſs could ſuggeſt to alleviate his ſufferings, and a mutual eſteem and confidence enſued.</p>
                     <p>Theodore at length communicated the chief ſubject of his concern to Louis, who diſcovered with inexpreſſible grief, that it was Adeline whom the Marquis had thus cruelly perſecuted, that Adeline for whoſe ſake the generous Theodore was about to ſuffer. He ſoon perceived alſo that Theodore was his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rival; but he generouſly ſuppreſſed the jealous pang this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery occaſioned, and determined that no prejudice of paſſion ſhould withdraw him from the duties of humanity and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. He eagerly inquired where Adeline then reſided. "She is yet, I fear, in the power of the Marquis," ſaid Theodore, ſighing deeply, "O God! theſe chains!" and he threw an agonizing glance upon them. Louis ſat ſilent and thoughtful; at length ſtarting from his reverie, he ſaid, he would go to the Marquis, and immediately quitted the priſon. The Marquis was, however, already ſet off for Paris, where he had been ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appear at the approaching trial of La Motte; and Louis, yet ignorant of the late tranſactions at the Abbey, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the priſon, where he endeavoured to forget that Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore was the favoured rival of his love, and to remember him only as the defender of Adeline. So earneſtly he preſſed his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:029379_0141_0FE08E2942E52660"/>
of ſervice, that Theodore, whom the ſilence of his father equally ſurpriſed and afflicted, and who was very anxious to ſee him once again, accepted his propoſal of going himſelf to Savoy. "My letters I ſtrongly ſuſpect to have been intercepted by the Marquis," ſaid Theodore; "if ſo, my poor father will have the whole weight of this c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lamity to ſuſtain at once, unleſs I avail myſelf of your kindneſs, and I ſhall neither ſee him nor hear from him before I die. Louis! there are moments when my fortitude ſhrinks from the conflict, and my ſenſes threaten to deſert me."</p>
                     <p>No time was to be loſt; the warrant for his execution had already received the king's ſignature, and Louis immediately ſet forward for Savoy. The letters of Theodore had indeed been intercepted by order of the Marquis, who, in the hope of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the aſylum of Adeline, had opened and afterwards deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed them.</p>
                     <p>But to return to La Luc, who now drew near Vaceau, and whom his family obſerved to be greatly changed in his looks ſince he had heard the late calamitous intelligence; he uttered no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; but it was too obvious that his diſorder had made a rapid progreſs. Louis, who, during the journey, proved the goodneſs of his diſpoſition by the delicate attentions he paid this unhappy party, concealed his obſervation of the decline of La Luc, and to ſupport Adeline's ſpirits, endeavoured to convince her that her apprehenſions on this ſubject were groundleſs. Her ſpirits did indeed require ſupport, for ſhe was now within a few miles of the town that contained Theodore; and while her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing perturbation almoſt overcome her, ſhe yet tried to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear compoſed. When the carriage entered the town, ſhe caſt a timid and anxious glance from the window in ſearch of the priſon; but having paſſed through ſeveral ſtreets without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any building which correſponded with her idea of that ſhe looked for, the coach ſtopped at the inn. The frequent changes in La Luc's countenance betrayed the violent agitation of his mind, and when he attempted to alight, feeble and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, he was compelled to accept the ſupport of Louis, to whom he faintly ſaid, as he paſſed to the parlour, "I am indeed ſick at heart, but I truſt the pain will not be long." Louis preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his hand without ſpeaking, and haſtened back for Adeline and Clara, who were already in the paſſage. La Luc wiped the tears from his eyes (they were the firſt he had ſhed) as they entered the room. "I would go immediately to my poor boy," ſaid he to Louis; "yours, Sir, is a mournful office—be ſo good
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029379_0142_0FE08E33CBC1DF58"/>
as to conduct me to him." He roſe to go, but, feeble and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with grief, again ſat down. Adeline and Clara united in entreating that he would compoſe himſelf, and take ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, and Louis urging the neceſſity of prepairing Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore for the interview, prevailed with him to delay it till his ſon ſhould be informed of his arrival, and immediately quitted the inn for the priſon of his friend. When he was gone, La Luc, as a duty he owed thoſe he loved, tried to take ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, but the convulſions of his throat would not ſuffer him to ſwallow the wire that he held to his parched lips, and he was now ſo much diſordered, that he deſired to retire to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where alone, and in prayer, he paſſed the dreadful interval of Louis's abſence.</p>
                     <p>Clara on the boſom of Adeline, who ſat in calm but deep diſtreſs, yielded to the violence of her grief. "I ſhall loſe my dear father too," ſaid ſhe; "I ſee it; I ſhall loſe my father and my brother together." Adeline wept with her friend for ſometime in ſilence; and then attempted to perſuade her that La Luc was not ſo ill as ſhe apprehended.</p>
                     <p>"Do not miſlead me with hope," ſhe replied, "he will not ſurvive the ſhock of this calamity: I ſaw it from the firſt." Adeline knowing that La Luc's diſtreſs would be heightened by the obſervance of his daughter's, and that indulgence would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe its poignancy, endeavoured to arouſe her to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of fortitude, by urging the neceſſity of commanding her emotion in the preſence of her father. "This is poſſible," added ſhe, "however painful may be the effort. You muſt know my dear, that my grief is not inferior to your own, yet I have hitherto been enabled to ſupport my ſufferings, in ſilence, for M. La Luc I do indeed, love and reverence as a parent."</p>
                     <p>Louis meanwhile reached the priſon of Theodore, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him with an air of mingled ſurpriſe and impatience. "What brings you back ſo ſoon," ſaid he, "have you heard news of my father?" Louis now gradually unfolded the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their meeting, and La Luc's arrival at Vaceau. A various emotion agitated the countenance of Theodore on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this intelligence. "My poor father!" ſaid he, "he has then followed his ſon to this ignominious place! Little did I think when laſt we parted he would meet me in a priſon, under condemnation!" This reflection rouſed an impetuoſity of grief which deprived him for ſometime of ſpeech. "But where is he?" ſaid Theodore, recovering himſelf; "now he is come, I ſhrink from the interview I have ſo much wiſhed for. The

                        </gap>ght of his diſtreſs will be dreadful to me. Louis! when I am gone, comfort my poor father." His voice was again interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſobs; and Louis, who had been fearful of acquainting him at the ſame time of the arrival of La Luc, and the diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of Adeline, now judged it proper to adminiſter the cordial of this latter intelligence.</p>
                     <p>The glooms of a priſon, and of calamity, vaniſhed for a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                        </gap>ent moment; thoſe who had ſeen Theodore would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved this to be the inſtant which gave him life and liberty. When his firſt emotions ſubſided, "I will not repine," ſaid he, "ſince I know that Adeline is preſerved, and that I ſhall once more ſee my father, I will endeavour to die with reſignation." He inquired if La Luc was then in the priſon; and was told he was at the inn with Clara and Adeline. "Adeline! Is Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line there too! "This is beyond my hopes. Yet why do I rejoice? I muſt never ſee her more: this is no place for Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line." Again he relapſed into an agony of diſtreſs, and again repeated a thouſand queſtions concerning Adeline, till he was reminded by Louis that his father was impatient to ſee him, when, ſhocked that he had ſo long detained his friend, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to conduct La Luc to the priſon, and endeavoured to recollect fortitude for the approaching interview.</p>
                     <p>When Louis returned to the inn, La Luc was ſtill in his chamber, and Clara quitting the room to call him, Adeline ſeized, with trembling impatience, the opportunity to inquire more particularly concerning Theodore, than ſhe choſe to do in the preſence of his unhappy ſiſter. Louis repreſented him to be much more tranquil than he really was: Adeline was ſomewhat ſoothed by the account; and her tears, hitherto reſtrained, flowed ſilently and faſt, till La Luc appeared. His countenance had recovered its ſerenity, but was impreſſed with a deep and ſteady ſorrow, which excited in the beholder a mingled emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pity and reverence. "How is my ſon? Sir," ſaid he as he entered the room. "We will go to him immediately."</p>
                     <p>Clara renewed the entreaties that had been already rejected, to accompany her father, who perſiſted in a refuſal. "To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row you ſhall ſee him," added he; "but our firſt meeting muſt be alone. Stay with your friend, my dear; ſhe has need of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation." When La Luc was gone, Adeline, unable longer to ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

overcome with agitation, leaned againſt the poſtern till the porter appeared. He inquired for Theodore, and followed the man; but when he reached the ſecond court yard he ſeemed ready to faint, and again ſtopped. Louis deſired the porter would fetch ſome water; but La Luc, recovering his voice, ſaid he ſhould ſoon be better, and would not ſuffer him to go. In a few minutes he was able to follow Louis, who led him through ſeveral dark paſſages, and up a flight of ſteps to a door, which being unbarred diſcloſed to him the priſon of his ſon. he was ſeated at a ſmall table, on which ſtood a lamp that threw a feeble light acroſs the place ſufficient only to ſhew its deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and wretchedneſs. When he perceived La Luc he ſprung from his chair, and in the next moment was in his arms, "My father ſaid he in a tremulous voice. "My ſon!" exclaimed La Luc; and they were for ſome time ſilent, and locked in each other's embrace. At length Theodore led him to the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chair the room afforded, and ſeating himſelf with Louis at the foot of the bed, had leiſure to obſerve the ravages which illneſs and calamity had made on the features of his parent. La Luc made ſeveral efforts to ſpeak, but unable to articulate, laid his hand upon his breaſt and ſighed deeply. Fearful of the conſequence of ſo affecting a ſcene on his ſhattered frame Louis endeavoured to call off his attention from the immediate object of his diſtreſs, and interrupted the ſilence; but La Luc ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and complaining he was very cold, ſunk back in his chair. His condition rouſed Theodore from the ſtupor of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; and while he flew to ſupport his father, Louis ran out for other aſſiſtance.—"I ſhall ſoon be better, Theodore," ſaid La Luc uncloſing his eyes, "the faintneſs is already gone off. I have not been well of late; and this ſad meeting!" Unable any longer to command himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theodore wrung his hand, and the diſtreſs which had long ſtruggled for utterance burſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive ſobs from his breaſt. La Luc gradually revived, and exerted himſelf to calm the tranſports of his ſon; but the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the latter had now entirely forſaken him, and he could only utter exclamation and complaint. "Ah! little did I think we ſhould ever meet under circumſtances ſo dreadful as the preſent! But I have not deſerved them, my father! the motives of my conduct have ſtill been juſt."</p>
                     <p>"That is my ſupreme conſolation," ſaid La Luc, "and ought to ſupport you in this hour of trial. The almighty God who is the judge of hearts, will reward you hereafter. Truſt in him my ſon; I look to him with no feeble hope, but with a firm reliance

                     <p>Still more affected by his laſt words, Theodore turned from him, and paced the room with quick ſteps: the entrance of Louis was a very ſeaſonable relief to La Luc, who, taking a cordial he had brought, was ſoon ſufficiently reſtored to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the ſubject moſt intereſting to him. Theodore tried to attain a command of his feelings, and ſucceeded. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with tolerable compoſure for above an hour, during which La Luc endeavoured to elevate, by religious hope, the mind of his ſon, and to enable him to meet with fortitude the awful hour that approached. But the appearance of reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which Theodore attained always vaniſhed when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected that he was going to leave his father a prey to grief, and his beloved Adeline for ever. When La Luc was about to dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t, he again mentioned her. "Afflicting as an interview muſt be in our preſent circumſtances," ſaid he, "I cannot hear the thought of quitting the world without ſeeing her once again; yet I know not how to aſk her to encounter for my ſake, the miſery of a parting ſcene. Tell her that my thoughts never for a moment leave her; that"—La Luc interrupted, and aſſured him, that ſince he ſo much wiſhed it, he ſhould ſee her, though a meeting could ſerve only to heighten the mutual anguiſh of a final ſeparation.</p>
                     <p>"I know it; I know it too well," ſaid Theodore; "yet I cannot reſolve to ſee her no more, and thus ſpare her the pain this interview muſt inflict. O my father! when I think of thoſe whom I muſt ſoon leave for ever my heart breaks. But I will indeed try to profit by your precept and example, and ſhew that your paternal care has not been in vain. My good Louis, go with my father; he has need of ſupport. How much I owe this generous friend," added Theodore, "You well know, Sir." "I do in truth," replied La Luc, "and can never repay his kindneſs to you.

This Theodore would not ſuffer; and La Luc no longer oppoſing him, they affectionately embraced, and ſeparated for the night.</p>
                     <p>When they reached the inn, La Luc conſulted with Louis on the poſſibility of addreſſing a petition to the ſovereign, time enough to ſave Theodore. His diſtance from Paris and the ſhort interval before the period fixed for the execution of the ſentence, made this deſign difficult; but believing it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,

La Luc, incapable as he appeared of performing ſo long a journey, determined to attempt it. Louis thinking that the undertaking would prove fatal to the father, without benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſon, endeavoured, though faintly, to diſſuade him from it; but his reſolution was fixed.

                     <p>He would have ordered poſt horſes, but Louis, and Clara, who was now come from the bed-ſide of her friend, urged the neceſſity of his taking a few hours repoſe: he was at length compelled to acknowledge himſelf unequal to the immediate exertion which the parental anxiety prompted, and conſented to ſeek reſt.</p>
                     <p>When he had retired to his chamber, Clara lamented the condition of her father. "He will not bear the journey," ſaid ſhe; "he is greatly changed within theſe few days." Louis was ſo entirely of her opinion that he could not diſguiſe it, even to flatter her with a hope. She added, what did not contribute to raiſe his ſpirits, that Adeline was ſo much indiſpoſed by her grief for the ſituation of Theodore, and the ſufferings of La Luc, that ſhe dreaded the conſequence.</p>
                     <p>It has been ſeen that the paſſion of young La Motte had ſuffered no abatement from time or abſence; on the contrary, the perſecution and the dangers which had purſued Adeline awakened all his tenderneſs, and drew her nearer to his heart. When he had diſcovered that Theodore loved her, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved again, he experienced all the anguiſh of jealouſy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment; for though ſhe had forbade him to hope, he found it too painful an effort to obey her, and had ſecretly cheriſhed the flame which he ought to have ſtifled. His heart was however, too noble to ſuffer his zeal for Theodore to abate becauſe he was his fovoured rival, and his mind too ſtrong not to conceal the anguiſh this certainty occaſioned. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment which Theodore had teſtified towards Adeline ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en endeared him to Louis, when he had recovered from the firſt ſhock of diſappointment, and that conqueſt over jealouſy which originated in principle, and was purſued with difficulty, became afterwards his pride and his glory. When, however, he again ſaw Adeline; ſaw her in the mild dignity of ſorrow more intereſting than ever; ſaw her, though ſinking beneath its preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet tender and ſolicitous to ſoften the afflictions of thoſe around her; it was with the utmoſt difficulty he preſerved his

When he farther conſidered that her acute ſufferings aroſe from the ſtrength of her affection, he more than ever wiſhed himſelf the object of a heart capable of ſo tender a regard, and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WE return now to Pierre de la Motte, who after remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome weeks in the priſon of D—y, was removed to take his trial in the court of Paris, whither the Marquis de Montalt followed to proſecute the charge. Madame de la Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te accompanied her huſband to the priſon of the Chatelet. His mind ſunk under the weight of his misfortunes; nor could all the efforts of his wife rouſe him from the torpidity of deſpair which a conſideration of his circumſtances occaſioned. Should he be even acquitted of the charge brought againſt him by the Marquis (which was very unlikely) he was now in the ſcene of his former crimes, and the moment that ſhould liberate him from the walls of his priſon would probably deliver him again into the hands of offended juſtice.</p>
                     <p>The proſecution of the Marquis was too well founded, and its object of a nature too ſerious, not to juſtify the terror of La Motte. Soon after the latter had ſettled at the Abbey of St. Clair, the ſmall ſtock of money which the emergency of his
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029379_0145_0FE08E4AB02A94E8"/>
circumſtances had left him being nearly exhauſted, his mind became corroded with the moſt cruel anxiety concerning the means of his future ſubſiſtance. As he was one evening riding alone in a remote part of the foreſt, muſing on his diſtreſſed circumſtances, and meditating plans to relieve the exigencies which he ſaw approaching, he perceived among the trees at ſome diſtance a chevalier on horſeback, who was riding deliberately along, and ſeemed wholly unattended. A thought darted acroſs the mind of La Motte, that he might be ſpared the evils which threatened him by robbing this ſtranger. His former practices had paſſed the boundary of honeſty; fraud was in ſome degree familiar to him, and the thought was not diſmiſſed. He heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, every moment of heſitation increaſed the power of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the opportunity was ſuch as might never occur again. He looked round, and as far as the trees opened ſaw no perſon but the chevalier, who ſeemed by his air to be a man of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Summoning all his courage, La Motte rode forward and attacked him. The Marquis de Montalt, for it was him, was unarmed but knowing that his attendants were not far off, he refuſed to yield. While they were ſtruggling for victory, La Motte ſaw ſeveral horſemen enter the extremity of the avenue, and rendered deſperate by oppoſition and delay, he drew from his pocket a piſtol (which an apprehenſion of banditti made him uſually carry when he rode to a diſtance from the abbey) and fired at the Marquis, who ſtaggered and fell ſenſeleſs to the ground. La Motte had time to tear from his coat a brilliant ſtar, ſome diamond rings from his fingers, and to rifle his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, before his attendants came up. Inſtead of purſuing the robber, they all in their firſt confuſion, flew to aſſiſt their lord, and La Motte eſcaped.</p>
                     <p>He ſtopped before he reached the Abbey at a little ruin, the tomb formerly mentioned, to examine his booty. It conſiſted of a purſe containing ſeventy louis d'ors; of a diamond ſtar, three rings of great value, and a miniature ſet with brilliants of the Marquis himſelf, which he had intended as a preſent for his favourite miſtreſs. To La Motte, who but a few hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had ſeen himſelf nearly deſtitute, the view of this treaſure excited an almoſt ungovernable tranſport; but it was ſoon checked when he remembered the means he had employed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o obtain it, and that he had paid for the wealth he contemplated the price of blood. Naturally violent in his paſſions, this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection ſunk him from the ſummit of exultation to the abyſs of deſpondency. He conſidered himſelf a murderer, and ſtartled
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029379_0145_0FE08E4AB02A94E8"/>
as one awakened from a dream, would have given half the world, had it been his, to have been as poor, and comparatively, as guiltleſs as a few preceding hours had ſeen him. On ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the portrait he diſcovered the reſemblance, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his hand had deprived the original of life, he gazed upon the picture with unutterable anguiſh. To the horrors of remorſe ſucceeded the perplexities of fear. Apprehenſive of he knew not what, he lingered at the tomb, where he at length depoſited his treaſure, believing that if his offence ſhould awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken juſtice, the Abbey might be ſearched, and thoſe jewels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him. From Madame La Motte it was eaſy to conceal his increaſe of wealth; for as he had never made her acquainted with the exact ſtate of his finances, ſhe had not ſuſpected the extreme poverty which menaced him, and as they continued to live as uſual, ſhe believed that their expenſes were drawn from the uſual ſupply. But it was not ſo eaſy to diſguiſe the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of remorſe and horror: his manner became gloomy and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ved, and his frequent viſits to the tomb, where he went partly to examine his treaſure, but chiefly to indulge in the dreadful pleaſure of contemplating the picture of the Marquis, excited curioſity. In the ſolitude of the foreſt, where no variety of objects occurred to renovate his ideas, the horrible one of having committed murder was ever preſent to him.—When the Marquis arrived at the Abbey, the aſtoniſhment and terror of La Motte, for at firſt he ſcarce knew whether he beheld the ſhadow or the ſubſtance of a human form, were quickly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by apprehenſion of the puniſhment due to the crime he had really committed. When his diſtreſs had prevailed on the Marquis to retire, he informed him that he was by birth a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>valier: he then touched upon ſuch parts of his misfortunes as he thought would excite pity, expreſſed ſuch abhorrence of his guilt and voluntarily uttered ſuch a ſolemn promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the jewels he had yet in his poſſeſſion, for he had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to diſpoſe only of a ſmall part, that the Marquis at length liſtened to him with ſome degree of compaſſion. This favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſentiment, ſeconded by a ſelfiſh motive, induced the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis to compromiſe with La Motte. Of quick and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble paſſions, he had obſerved the beauty of Adeline with an eye of no common regard, and he reſolved to ſpare the life of La Motte upon no other condition than the ſacrifice of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate girl. La Motte had neither reſolution or virtue ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to reject the terms—the jewels were reſtored, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to betray the innocent Adeline. But as he was too well
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029379_0146_0FE08E54798288C0"/>
acquainted with her heart to believe that ſhe would eaſily be won to the practice of vice, and as he ſtill felt a degree of pity and tenderneſs for her, he endeavoured to prevail on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis to forbear precipitate meaſures, and to attempt gradually to undermine her principles by ſeducing her affections. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and adopted this plan: the failure of his firſt ſcheme induced him to employ the ſtratagems he afterwards purſued, and thus to multiply the misfortunes of Adeline.</p>
                     <p>Such were the circumſtances which had brought La Motte to his preſent deplorable ſituation. The day of trial was now come, and he was led from priſon into the court, where the Marquis appeared as his accuſer. When the charge was deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, La Motte, as is uſual, pleaded not guilty, and the Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Nemours, who had undertaken to plead for him, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards endeavoured to make it appear that the accuſation, on the part of the Marquis de Montalt, was falſe and malicious. To this purpoſe he mentioned the circumſtance of the latter having attempted to perſuade his client to the murder of Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line: he farther urged that the Marquis had lived in habits of intimacy with La Motte for ſeveral months immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding his arreſt, and that it was not till he had diſappointed the deſigns of his accuſer, by conveying beyond his reach the unhappy object of his vengeance, that the Marquis had thought proper to charge La Motte with the crime for which he ſtood indicted. Nemours urged the improbability of one man's keeping up a friendly intercourſe with another from whom he had ſuffered the double injury of aſſault and robbery; yet it was certain that the Marquis had obſerved a frequent inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with La Motte for ſome months following the time ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for the commiſſion of the crime. If the Marquis intended to proſecute, why was it not immediately after his diſcovery of La Motte? and if not then, what had influenced him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute at ſo diſtant a period?</p>
                     <p>To this nothing was replied on the part of the Marquis; for as his conduct on this point had been ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſervient to his deſigns on Adeline, he could not juſtify it but by expoſing ſchemes which would betray the darkneſs of his character, and invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date his cauſe. He, therefore, contented himſelf with produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral of his ſervants as witneſſes of the aſſault and robbery, who ſwore without ſcruple to the perſon of La Motte, though not one of them had ſeen him other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029379_0146_0FE08E54798288C0"/>
of courſe rejected; but as the Marquis had yet two other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to produce, whoſe arrival at Paris had been hourly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the event of the trial was poſtponed, and the court adjourned.</p>
                     <p>La Motte was re-conducted to his priſon under the ſame preſſure of deſpondency with which he had quitted it. As he walked through one of the avenues he paſſed a man who ſtood by to let him proceed, and who regarded him with a fixed and earneſt eye. La Motte thought he had ſeen him before; but the imperfect view he caught of his features through the duſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the place made him uncertain as to this, and his mind was in too perturbated a ſtate to ſuffer him to feel an intereſt on the ſubject. When he was gone, the ſtranger inquired of the keeper of the priſon, who La Motte was; on being told, and receiving anſwers to ſome farther queſtions he put, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired he might be admitted to ſpeak with him. The requeſt, as the man was only a debtor, was granted, but as the doors were now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ut up for the night, the interview was deferred till the morrow.</p>
                     <p>La Motte found Madame in his room where ſhe had been waiting for ſome hours to hear the event of the trial. They now wiſhed more earneſtly than ever to ſee their ſon; but he was as they had ſuſpected, ignorant of their change of quarters, owing to the letters which he had, as uſual, addreſſed to them under an aſſumed name, remaining at the poſt-houſe of Auborn. This circumſtance occaſioned Madame La Motte to addreſs her letters to the place of her ſon's late reſidence, and he had thus continued ignorant of his father's misfortunes and removal. Madame La Motte, ſurpriſed at receiving no anſwers to her letters, ſent off another, containing an account of the trial as far as it had proceeded, and a requeſt that her ſon would obtain leave of abſence, and ſet out for Paris inſtantly. As ſhe was ſtill ignorant of the failure of her letters, and had it been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, would not have known whither to have ſent them, ſhe directed this as uſual.</p>
                     <p>Mean while his approaching fate was never abſent for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the mind of La Motte, which feeble by nature, and ſtill more enervated by habits of indulgence, refuſed to ſupport him at this dreadful period.</p>

                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Sir, to aſk the ſucceſs of your journey; yet, when you can bear to mention the ſubject I wiſh"—</p>
                     <p>La Luc waved his hand—"Alas!" ſaid he, "I have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tell but what you already gueſs too well. My poor The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odore!"—His voice was convulſed with ſorrow, and ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unutterable anguiſh followed.</p>
                     <p>Adeline was the firſt who recovered ſufficient recollection to notice the extreme langour of La Luc, and attend to his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. She ordered him refreſhments, and entreated he would retire to his bed and ſuffer her to ſend for a phyſician; adding, that the fatigue he had ſuffered made repoſe abſolutely neceſſary. "Would that I could find it my dear child," ſaid he; "it is not in this world that I muſt look for it, but in a better, and that better I truſt, I ſhall ſoon attain. But where is our good friend, Louis La Motte; he muſt lead me to my ſon,"—Grief again interrupted his utterance, and the entrance of Louis was a very ſeaſonable relief to them all. Their tears explained the queſtion he would have aſked; La Luc immediately inquired for his ſon, and thanking Louis for all his kindneſs to him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be conducted to the priſon. Louis endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to defer his viſit till the morning, and Adeline and Clara joined their entreaties with his, but La Luc determined to go that night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—"His time is ſhort," ſaid he; "a few hours and I ſhall ſee him no more, at leaſt in this world, let me not neglect theſe precious moments.

impatient and attempted to ſpeak. La Luc roſe to depart but could only reach the door of the room where, faint and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he ſat down in a chair. "I muſt ſubmit to neceſſity," ſaid he; "I find I am not able to go farther to-night. Go to him, La Motte, and tell him I am ſomewhat diſordered by my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but that I will be with him early in the morning. Do not flatter him with a hope; prepare him for the worſt."—There was a pauſe of ſilence; La Luc at length recovering himſelf, deſired Clara would order his bed to be got ready, and ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obeyed. When he withdrew, Adeline told Louis, what was indeed unneceſſary, the event of La Luc's journey. "I own," continued ſhe, "that I had ſometimes ſuffered myſelf to hope, and I now feel this calamity with double force. I fear too that M. La Luc will ſink under its preſſure; he is much altered for the worſe ſince he ſet out for Paris. Tell me your opinion ſincerely."</p>
                     <p>The change was ſo obvious, that Louis could not deny it, but he endeavoured to ſooth her apprehenſion by aſcribing this alteration, in a great meaſure, to the temporary fatigue of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Adeline declared her reſolution of accompanying La Luc to take leave of Theodore in the morning. "I know not how I ſhall ſupport the interview." ſaid ſhe; "but to ſee him once more is a duty I owe both to him and myſelf. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of having neglected to give him this laſt proof of affection would purſue me with inceſſant remorſe."</p>
                     <p>After ſome farther converſation on this ſubject Louis withdrew to the priſon, ruminating on the beſt means of imparting to his friend the fatal intelligence he had to communicate. Theodore received it with more compoſure than he had expected; but he aſked, with impatience, why he did not ſee his father and Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, and on being informed that indiſpoſition withheld them, his imagination ſeized on the worſt poſſibility, and ſuggeſted that his father was dead. It was a conſiderable time before Louis could convince him of the contrary, and that Adeline was not dangereouſly ill; when, however, he was aſſured that he ſhould ſee them in the morning, he became more tranquil. He deſired his friend would not leave him that night. Theſe are the laſt hours we can paſs together," added he; "I cannot ſleep! Stay with me and lighten their heavy moments, I have need of comfort, Louis. Young as I am, and held by ſuch ſtrong at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, I cannot quit the world with reſignation. I know not how to credit theſe ſtories we hear of philoſophic fortitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wiſdom cannot teach us cheerfully to reſign a good, and life in my circumſtances is ſurely ſuch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="unknown:029379_0148_0FE08E69CA16AC10"/>The night was paſſed in embarraſſed converſation; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times interrupted by long fits of ſilence, and ſometimes by the paroxyſms of deſpair; and the morning of that day which was to lead Theodore to death at length dawned through the grates of his priſon.</p>
                     <p>La Luc mean while paſſed a ſleepleſs and dreadful night. He prayed for fortitude and reſignation both for himſelf and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore; but the pangs of nature were powerful in his heart, and not to be ſubdued. The idea of his lamented wife, and of what ſhe would have ſuffered had ſhe lived to witneſs the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death which awaited her ſon, frequently occurred to him.</p>
                     <p>It ſeemed as if a deſtiny had hung over the life of Theodore, for it is probable that the king might have granted the petition of the unhappy father, had it not happened that the Marquis de Montalt was preſent a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> court when the paper was preſented. The appearance and ſingular diſtreſs of the petitioner had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted the monarch, and, inſtead of putting by the paper, he opened it. As he threw his eyes over it, obſerving that the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal was of the Marquis de Montalt's regiment: he turned to him and inquired the nature of the offence for which the culprit was about to ſuffer. The anſwer was ſuch as might have been expected from the Marquis, and the king was convinced that Theodore was not a proper object of mercy.</p>
                     <p>But to return to La Luc, who was called according to his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, at a very early hour. Having paſſed ſome time in prayer, he went down to the parlour where Louis punctual to the moment, already waited to conduct him to the priſon. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared calm and collected, but his countenance was impreſſed with a fixed deſpair that ſenſibly affected his young friend. While they waited for Adeline he ſpoke little, and ſeemed ſtruggling to attain the fortitude neceſſary to ſupport him through the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ſcene. Adeline not appearing, he at length ſent to haſten her, and was told ſhe had been ill, but was recovering. She had indeed paſſed a night of ſuch agitation, that her frame had ſunk under it, and ſhe was now endeavouring to recover ſtrength and compoſure ſufficient to ſuſtain her in this dreadful hour. Every moment that brought her nearer to it had increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her emotion, and the apprehenſion of being prevented ſeeing Theodore, had alone enabled her to ſtruggle againſt the united preſſure of il<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>She now, with Clara, joined La Luc, who advanced as they entered the room, and took a hand of each in ſilence. After ſome moments he propoſed to go, and they ſtepped into a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029379_0149_0FE08E6E8001C908"/>
which conveyed them to the gates of the priſon. The crowd had already began to aſſemble there, and a confuſed mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer aroſe as the carriage moved forward; it was a grevious fight to the friends of Theodore. Louis ſupported Adeline when ſhe alighted, ſhe was ſcarcely able to walk, and with trembling ſteps ſhe followed La Luc, whom the keeper led towards that part of the priſon where his ſon was confined. It was now eight o'clock, the ſentence was not to be executed till twelve, but a guard of ſoldiers was already placed in the court, and as this unhappy party paſſed along the narrow avenues they were met by ſeveral officers who had been to take a laſt farewell of Theodore. As they aſcended the ſtairs that led to his apartment, La Luc's ear caught the clink of chains, and heard him walking above with a quick irregular ſtep. The unhappy father, overcome by the moment which now preſſed upon him, ſtopped and was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupport himſelf by the baniſter. Louis fearing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his grief might be fatal, ſhattered as his frame alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was, would have gone for aſſiſtance, but he made a ſign to him to ſtay. "I am better;" ſaid La Luc, "O God! ſupport me through this hour!" and in a few moments he was able to proceed.</p>
                     <p>As the warder unlocked the door, the harſh grating of the key ſhocked Adeline, but in the next moment ſhe was in the preſence of Theodore who ſprung to meet her, and caught her in his arms before ſhe ſunk to the ground. As her head reclined on his ſhoulder, he again viewed that countenance ſo dear to him, which had ſo often lighted rapture in his heart, and which, though pale and inanimate as it now was, awakened him to momentary delight. When at length ſhe uncloſed her eyes, ſhe fixed them in long and mournful gaze upon Theodore, who preſſing her to his heart, could anſwer her only with a ſmile of mingled tenderneſs and deſpair; the tears he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reſtrain trembled in his eyes, and he forgot for a time every thing but Adeline. La Luc who had ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the foot of the bed, ſeemed unconſcious of what paſſed around him, and entirely abſorbed in his own grief; but Clara, as ſhe claſped the hand of her brother, and hung weeping on his arm, expreſſed aloud all the anguiſh of her heart, and at length recalled the attention of Adeline, who in a voice ſcarcely audible entreated ſhe would ſpare her father. Her words rouſed Theodore, and ſupporting Adeline to a chair, he turned to La Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> "My dear child!" ſaid La Luc, graſping his hand and burſting into tears, "My dear child!" They wept together. After a long interval of ſilence, he ſaid, "I thought I could have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:029379_0149_0FE08E6E8001C908"/>
this hour, but I am old and feeble. God knows my efforts for reſignation, my faith in his goodneſs!"</p>
                     <p>Theodore by a ſtrong and ſudden exertion, aſſumed a compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and firm countenance, and endeavoured by every gentle argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſooth and comfort his weeping friends. La Luc at length ſeemed to conquer his ſufferings; drying his eyes, he ſaid, "My ſon, I ought to have ſet you a better example, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed the precepts of fortitude I have ſo often given you. But it is over; I know, and will perform my duty." Adeline breathed a heavy ſigh, and continued to weep. "Be comforted, my love, we part but for a time," ſaid Theodore as he kiſſed the tears from her cheek; and uniting her hand with that of his father's, he earneſtly recommended her to his protection. "Receive her," added he, "as the moſt precious legacy I can bequeath; conſider her as your child. She will conſole you when I am gone, ſhe will more than ſupply the loſs of your ſon."</p>
                     <p>La Luc aſſured him that he did now, and ſhould continue to, regard Adeline as his daughter. During thoſe afflicting hours he endeavoured to diſſipate the terrors of approaching death by inſpiring his ſon with religious confidence. His converſation was pious, rational and conſolatory: he ſpoke not from the cold dictates of the head, but from the feelings of a heart which had long loved and practiſed the pure precepts of chriſtianity, and which now drew from them a comfort ſuch as nothing earthly could beſtow.</p>
                     <p>"You are young, my ſon," ſaid he, "and are yet innocent of any great crime; you may therefore look on death without ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, for to the guilty only is his approach dreadful. I feel that I ſhall not long ſurvive you, and I truſt in a merciful God that we ſhall meet in a ſtate where ſorrow never comes; <hi>where the Son of Righteouſneſs ſhall come with healing in his wing!</hi>" As he ſpoke he looked up; the tears ſtill trembled in his eyes, which beamed with meek yet fervent devotion, and his countenance glowed with the dignity of a ſuperior being.</p>
                     <p>"Let us not neglect the awful moments," ſaid La Luc, riſing, "let our united prayers aſcend to Him who alone can comfort and ſupport us!" They all knelt down, and he prayed with that ſimple and ſublime eloquence which true piety inſpires. When he roſe he embraced his children ſeparately, and when he came to Theodore he pauſed, gazed upon him with an earneſt, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expreſſion, and was for ſometime unable to ſpeak. Theodore could not bear this; he drew his hand before his eyes, and vainly endeavoured to ſtifle the deep ſobs which convulſed his frame.
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029379_0150_0FE08E7BCB1EDCE0"/>
At length recovering his voice, he entreated his father would leave him. "This miſery is too much for us all," ſaid he, "let us not prolong it. The time it now drawing on—leave me to compoſe myſelf. The ſharpneſs of death conſiſts in parting with thoſe who are dear to us; when that is paſſed death is diſarmed."</p>
                     <p>"I will not leave you, my ſon," replied La Luc, "My poor girl ſhall go, but for me I will be with you in your laſt moments." Theodore felt that this would be too much for them both, and urged every argument which reaſon could ſuggeſt to prevail with his father to relinquiſh his deſign. But he remained firm in his determination. "I will not ſuffer a ſelfiſh conſideration of the pain I may endure," ſaid La Luc, "to tempt me to deſert my child when he will moſt require my ſupport. It is my duty to attend you, and nothing ſhall withhold me."</p>
                     <p>Theodore ſeized on the words of La Luc: "As you would that I ſhould be ſupported in my laſt hour," ſaid he, "I entreat that you will not be witneſs of it.

Add not to my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings the view of your diſtreſs, but leave me to forget, if poſſible, the dear parent I muſt quit for ever." His tears flowed anew. La Luc continued to gaze on him in ſilent agony; at length he ſaid, "Well, be it ſo. If indeed my preſence would diſtreſs you, I will not go." His voice was broken and interrupted. After a pauſe of ſome moments he again embraced Theodore: "We muſt part," ſaid he, "we <hi>muſt</hi> part, but it is only for a tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>: we ſhall ſoon be re-united in a higher world! O God! thou ſeeſt my heart; thou ſeeſt all its feelings in this bitter hour!" Grief again overcame him. He preſſed Theodore in his arms; and at length, ſeeming to ſummon all his fortitude, he again ſaid, "We <hi>muſt</hi> part: Oh! my ſon, farewell for ever in this world! The mercy of almighty God ſupport and bleſs you!"</p>
                     <p>He turned away to leave the priſon, but quite worn out with grief, ſunk into a chair near the door he would have opened. Theodore gazed, with a diſtracted countenance, alternately on his father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on Clara, and on Adeline whom he preſſed to his throb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing heart, and their tears flowed together. "And do I then," cried he, "for the laſt time look upon that countenance! Shall I never, never more behold it? O! exquiſite miſery! Yet once again, once more," continued he, preſſing her cheek, but it was inſenſible and cold as marble.</p>

Adeline raiſed her head, and perceiving who entered, it again ſunk on the boſom of Theodore.</p>
                     <p>Louis appeared much agitated. La Luc aroſe. "We muſt go," ſaid he: "Adeline, my love, exert yourſelf; Clara, my children, let us depart. Yet one laſt, laſt embrace, and then!" —Louis advanced and took his hand; "My dear Sir, I have ſomething to ſay; yet I fear to tell it." "What do you mean?" ſaid La Luc, with quickneſs: "No new misfortune can have power to afflict me at this moment. Do not fear to ſpeak." "I rejoice that I cannot put you to the proof." replied Louis; "I have ſeen you ſuſtain the moſt trying affliction with fortitude. Can you ſupport the tranſports of hope?" La Luc gazed eagerly on Louis. "Speak!" ſaid he, in a faint voice. Adeline raiſed her head, and trembling between hope and fear, looked at Louis as if ſhe would have ſearched his ſoul. He ſmiled cheerfully upon her. "Is it: O! Is it poſſible!" ſhe exclaimed, ſuddenly re-animated. "He lives! He lives!" She ſaid no more, but ran to La Luc, who ſunk fainting in his chair, while Theodore and Clara with one voice called on Louis to relieve them from the tortures of ſuſpenſe.</p>
                     <p>He proceeded to inform them that he had obtained from the commanding officer a reſpite for Theodore till the king's farther pleaſure could be known, and this in conſequence of a letter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that morning from his mother, Madame de la Motte, in which ſhe mentioned ſome very extraordinary circumſtances that had appeared in the courſe of a trial lately coducted at Paris, and which ſo materially affected the character of the Marquis de Montalt as to render it poſſible a pardon might be obtained for Theodore.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words darted with the rapidity of lightning upon the hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>He embraced Theodore, and remembering the anguiſh of his laſt embrace, tears of thankfulneſs and joy flowed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt. So powerful indeed was the effect of this temporary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve, and of the hope it introduced, that if an abſolute pardon had been obtained, it could ſcarcely for the moment had diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a more lively joy. But when the firſt emotions were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, the uncertainty of Theodore's fate once more appeared. Adeline forbore to expreſs this, but Clara without ſcruple la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the poſſibility that her brother might yet be taken from

them, and all their joy be turned to ſorrow. A look from Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line checked her. Joy was, however, ſo much the predominant feeling of the preſent moment, that the ſhade which reflection threw upon their hopes paſſed away like the cloud that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the ſtrength of the ſunbeam; and Louis alone was penſive and abſtracted.</p>
                     <p>When they were ſufficiently compoſed, he informed them that the contents of Madame La Motte's letter obliged him to ſet out for Paris immediately<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the intelligence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He then read to his impatient auditors ſuch paſſages in the letter as were neceſſary to explain his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but as Madame de la Motte had omitted to mention ſome circumſtances of importance to be underſtood, the following is a relation of the occurrences that had lately happened at Paris.</p>
                     <p>It may be remembered, that on the firſt day of the trial, La Motte, in paſſing from the courts to his priſon, ſaw a perſon whoſe features, though imperfectly ſeen through the duſk, he thought he recollected; and that this ſame perſon, after inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of La Motte, deſired to be admitted to him. On the following day the warder complied with his requeſt, and the ſurpriſe of La Motte may be imagined when, in the ſtronger light of his apartment, he diſtinguiſhed the countenance of the man from whoſe hands he had formerly received Adeline.</p>
                     <p>On obſerving Madame de la Motte in the room, he ſaid, he had ſomething of conſequence to impart, and deſired to be left alone with the priſoner. When ſhe was gone, he told de la Motte that he underſtood he was confined at the ſuit of the Marquis de Montalt. La Motte aſſented.—"I know him for a villain ſaid the ſtranger boldly. "Your caſe is deſperate. Do you wiſh for life?"</p>
                     <p>"Need the queſtion be aſked!"</p>
                     <p>"Your trial, I underſtand, proceeds to-morrow. I am now under confinement in this place for debt; but if you can obtain leave for me to go with you into the courts, and a condition from the judge that what I reveal ſhall not crimitate myſelf, I will make diſcoveries that ſhall confound that ſame Marquis; I will prove him a villain; and it ſhall then be judged how far his word ought to be taken againſt you."</p>
                     <p>La Motte, whoſe intereſt was now ſtrongly excited, deſired he would explain himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the man proceeded to relate a long hiſtory of the misfortunes and conſequent poverty which had
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029379_0151_0FE08E80884DFA00"/>
tempted him to become ſubſervient to the ſchemes of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, till he ſuddenly checked himſelf, and ſaid, "When I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the court the promiſe I require, I will explain myſelf fully; till then I cannot ſay more on the ſubject."</p>
                     <p>La Motte could not forbear expreſſing a doubt of his ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a curioſity concerning the motive that had induced him to become the Marquis's accuſer—"As to my motive it is a very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ral one," replied the man: it is no eaſy matter to receive ill uſage without reſenting it, particularly from a villain whom you have ſerved."—La Motte, for his own ſake, endeavoured to check the vehemence with which this was uttered. I care not who hears me," continued the ſtranger, but at the ſame time he lowered his voice; "I repeat it—the Marquis has uſed me ill—I have kept his ſecret long enough. He does not think it worth while to ſecure my ſilence, or he would relieve my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. I am in priſon for debt, and have applied to him for relief: ſince he does not chuſe to give it, let him take the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. I warrant he ſhall ſoon repent that he has provoked me, and 'tis fit he ſhould."</p>
                     <p>The doubts of La Motte were now diſſipated; the proſpect of life again opened upon him, and he aſſured Du Boſſe (which was the ſtranger's name) with much warmth, that he would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion his advocate to do all in his power to obtain leave for his appearance on the trial, and to procure the neceſſary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, After ſome farther converſation they parted.</p>

                     <p>LEAVE was at length granted for the appearance of Du Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, with a promiſe that his words ſhould not criminate him, and he accompanied La Motte into court.</p>
                     <p>The confuſion of the Marquis de Montalt on perceiving this man was obſerved by many perſons preſent, and particularly by La Motte, who drew from this circumſtance a favourable preſage for himſelf.</p>
                     <p>When Du Boſſe was called upon, he informed the court, that on the night of the twenty-firſt of April in the preceding year, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Jean d'Aunoy, a man he had known many years, came to
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:029379_0152_0FE08E8D01A70110"/>
his lodging. After they had diſcourſed for ſome time on their circumſtances, d'Aunoy ſaid he knew a way by which Du Boſſe might change all his poverty into riches, but that he would not ſay more till he was certain he would be willing to follow it. The diſtreſſed ſtate in which Du Boſſe then was, made him anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to learn the means which would bring him relief; he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly inquired what his friend meant, and after ſome time d'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy explained himſelf. He ſaid he was employed by a nobleman (who he afterwards told Du Boſſe was the Marquis de Montalt) to carry off a young girl from a convent, and that ſhe was to be, taken to a houſe at a few leagues diſtant from Paris. "I knew the houſe he deſcribed well," ſaid Du Boſſe, "for I had been there many times with d'Aunoy, who lived there to avoid his creditors, though he often paſſed his nights at Paris." He would not tell me more of the ſcheme, but ſaid he ſhould want aſſiſtance, and if I and my brother, who is ſince dead, would join him, his employer would grudge no money, and we ſhould be well rewarded. I deſired him again to tell me more of the plan, but he was obſtinate, and after I had told him I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of what he had ſaid and ſpeak to my brother, he went away.</p>
                     <p>When he called the next night for his anſwer, my brother and I agreed to engage, and accordingly we went home with him. He then told us that the young lady he was to bring thither was a natural daughter of the Marquis de Montalt, and of a nun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to a convent of Urſalines; that his wife had received the child immediately on its birth, and had been allowed a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome annuity to bring it up as her own, which ſhe had done till her death. The child was then placed in a convent and deſigned for the veil; but when ſhe was of an age to receive the vows, ſhe had ſteadily perſiſted in refuſing them. This circumſtance had ſo much exaſperated the Marquis, that in his rage he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if ſhe perſiſted in her obſtinacy ſhe ſhould be removed from the convent, and got rid of any way, ſince if ſhe lived in the world her birth might be diſcovered, and in conſequence of this, her mother for whom he had yet a regard, would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to expatiate her crime by a terrible death."</p>
                     <p>Du Boſſe was interrupted in his narrative by the council of the Marquis, who contended that the circumſtances alleged tending to criminate his client, the proceeding was both irrelevant and illegal. He was anſwered that it was not irrelevant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not illegal, for that the circumſtances which threw light upon the character of the Marquis, affected his evidence againſt La Motte. Du Boſſe was ſuffered to proceed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="145" facs="unknown:029379_0152_0FE08E8D01A70110"/>"D' Aunoy then ſaid that the Marquis had ordered him to diſpatch her, but that as he had been uſed to ſee her from her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, he could not find in his heart to do it, and wrote to tell him ſo. The Marquis then commanded him to ſend thoſe who would, and this was the buſineſs for which he wanted us. My brother and I were not ſo wicked as this came to, and ſo we told d'Aunoy, and I could not help aſking why the Marquis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to murder his own child rather than expoſe her mother to the riſque of ſuffering death. He ſaid the Marquis had never ſeen his child, and that therefore it could not be ſuppoſed he felt much kindneſs towards it, and ſtill leſs that he could love it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he loved its mother."</p>
                     <p>Du Boſſe proceeded to relate how much he and his brother had endeavoured to ſoften the heart of d'Aunoy towards the Marquis's daughter, and that they prevailed with him to write again and plead for her. D'Aunoy went to Paris to await the anſwer, leaving them and the young girl at the houſe on the heath, where the former had conſented to remain, ſeemingly for the purpoſe of executing the orders they might receive, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with a deſign to ſave the unhappy victim from the ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>It is probable that Du Boſſe, in this inſtance, gave a falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his motive, ſince if he was really guilty of an intention ſo atrocious as that of murder, he would naturally endeavour to conceal it. However this might be, he affirmed that on the night of the twenty ſixth of April, he received an order from d'Aunoy for the diſtruction of the girl whom he had afterwards delivered into the hands of La Motte.</p>
                     <p>La Motte liſtened to this relation in aſtoniſhment; when he knew that Adeline was the daughter of the Marquis, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered the crime to which he had once devoted her, his frame thrilled with horror. He now took up the ſtory, and added an account of what had paſſed at the Abbey between the Marquis and himſelf concerning a deſign of the former upon the life of Adeline; and urged, as a proof of the preſent proſecution originating in malice, that it had commenced immediately after he had effected her eſcape from the Marquis. He concluded, however, with ſaying, that as the Marquis had immediately ſent his people in purſuit of her, it was poſſible ſhe might yet have fallen a victim to his vengeance.</p>
                     <p>Here the Marquis's council again interferred and their objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were again overruled by the court. The uncommon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of emotion which his countenance betrayed during the narrations of Du Boſſe and De La Motte, was generally obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029379_0153_0FE08E92FA61BD60"/>
The court ſuſpended the ſentence of the latter, ordered that the Marquis ſhould be put under immediate arreſt, and that Adeline (the name given by her foſter mother) and Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>When the time of her departure arrived, the ſpirits of Adeline again forſook her, and the illuſions of joy diſappeared. She no longer beheld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theodore as one reſpited from death, but took leave of him with a mournful pre-ſentiment that ſhe ſhould ſee him no more. So ſtrongly was this preſage impreſſed upon her mind, that it was long before ſhe could ſummon reſolution to bid him farewell; and when ſhe had done ſo, and even left the apartment, ſhe returned to take of him a laſt look. As ſhe was once more quitting the room, her melancholy imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion repreſented Theodore at the place of execution, pale and convulſed in death; ſhe again turned her lingering eyes upon him; but fancy affected her ſenſe, for ſhe thought as ſhe now gazed that his countenance changed and aſſumed a ghaſtly hue. All her reſolution vaniſhed, and ſuch was the anguiſh of her heart, that ſhe reſolved to defer her journey till the morrow, though ſhe muſt by this means loſe the projection of Louis, whoſe impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to meet his father would not ſuffer the delay. The tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of paſſion, however, was tranſient; ſoothed by the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhe promiſed herſelf, her grief ſubſided, reaſon reſumed its, influence; ſhe again ſaw the neceſſity of her immediate depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and recollected ſufficient reſolution to ſubmit. La Luc would have accompanied her for the purpoſe of again ſoliciting the King in behalf of his ſon, had not the extreme weakneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>itude to which he was reduced made travelling impracticable.</p>
                     <p>At length, Adeline, with a heavy heart quitted Theodore, notwithſtanding his entreaties that ſhe would not undertake the journey in her preſent weak ſtate, and was accompanied by Clara and La Luc to the inn. The former parted from her friend with many tears and much anxiety for her welfare, but under a
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029379_0154_0FE08E9FF321B8C0"/>
hope of ſoon meeting again. Should a pardon be granted to Theodore, La Luc deſigned to fetch Adeline from Paris; but ſhould this be refuſed, ſhe was to return with Peter. He bade her adieu with a father's kindneſs, which ſhe repaid with a filial affection, and in her laſt words conjured him to attend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his health: the languid ſmile he aſſumed ſeemed to expreſs that her ſolicitude was vain, and that he thought his health paſt recovery.</p>
                     <p>Thus Adeline quitted the friends ſo juſtly dear to her, and ſo lately found, for Paris, where ſhe was a ſtranger, almoſt without protection, and compelled to meet a father who had purſued her with the utmoſt cruelty, in a public court of juſtice.

She then ſunk back in the carriage, and yielding to the melancholy of her heart, wept<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſilence. Louis was not diſpoſed to interrupt it; his thoughts were anxiouſly employed on his father's ſituation and the travellers proceeded many miles without exchanging a word.</p>
                     <p>At Paris, whither we ſhall now return, the ſearch after Jea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> d'Aunoy was proſecuted without ſucceſs. The houſe on the heath, deſcribed by du Boſſe, was found uninhabited, and to the places of his uſual reſort in the city, where the officers of the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice awaited him, he no longer came. It even appeared doubtful whether he was living, for he had abſented himſelf from the houſes of his cuſtomary rendezvous ſome time before the trial of La Motte; it was therefore certain that his abſence was not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by any thing which had paſſed in the courts.</p>
                     <p>In the ſolitude of his confinement the Marquis had leiſure to reflect on the paſt, and to repent of his crimes; but reflection and repentance formed as yet no part of his diſpoſition. He turned with impatience from recollections which produced only pain, and looked forward to the future with an endeavour to avert the diſgrace and puniſhment which he ſaw impending. The ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of his manners had ſo effectually veiled the depravity of his heart, that he was a favourite with his ſovereign; and on this circumſtance he reſted his hope of ſecurity. He, however, ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented that he had indulged the haſty ſpirit of revenge which had urged him to proſecute La Motte, and had thus unexpectedly involved him in a ſituation dangerous, if not fatal; ſince if Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029379_0154_0FE08E9FF321B8C0"/>
could not be found he would be concluded guilty of her death. But the appearance of d'Aunoy was the circumſtance <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe were, however, as unſucceſsful in their reſearch as the officers of the police, and the Marquis at length began to hope the man was really dead.</p>
                     <p>La Motte mean while awaited with trembling impatience the arrival of his ſon, when he ſhould be relieved, in ſome degree from his uncertainty concerning Adeline. On his appearance he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> much of its validity from the confirmation ſhe would give of the bad character of his proſecutor; and if the Parliament even condemned La Motte, the clemency of the King might yet ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his favour.</p>
                     <p>Adeline arrived at Paris after a journey of ſeveral days, during which ſhe was chiefly ſupported by the delicate attentions of Louis whom ſhe pitied and eſteemed, though ſhe could not love. She was immediately viſited at the hotel by Madame La Motte: the meeting was affecting on both ſides. A ſenſe of her paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct excited in the latter an embarraſſment which the delicacy and goodneſs of Adeline would willingly have ſpared her; but the pardon ſolicited was given with ſo much ſincerity, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame gradually became compoſed and re-aſſured. This forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, however, could not have been thus eaſily granted, had Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line believed her former conduct was voluntary; a conviction of the reſtraint and terror under which Madame had acted, alone induced her to excuſe the paſt. In this firſt meeting they forbore dwelling on particuler ſubjects; Madame La Motte propoſed that Adeline ſhould remove from the hotel to her lodgings near the Chatelet, and Adeline, for whom a reſidence at a public hotel was very improper, gladly accepted the offer.</p>
                     <p>Madame there gave her a circumſtantial account of La Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te's ſituation, and concluded with ſaying, that as the ſentence of her huſband had been ſuſpended till ſome certainty could be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained containing the late criminal deſigns of the Marquis, and as Adeline could confirm the chief part of La Motte's teſtimony, it was probable that now ſhe was arrived the Court would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed immediately. She now learnt the full extent of her obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to La Motte; for ſhe was till now ignorant that when he ſent her from the foreſt he ſaved her from death. Her horror of the Marquis whom ſhe could not bear to conſider as her father, and her gratitude to her deliverer, redoubled, and ſhe became
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:029379_0155_0FE069A0AC03AB70"/>
impatient to give the teſtimony ſo neceſſary to the hopes of her preſerver. Madame then ſaid, ſhe believed it was not too late to gain admittance that night to the Chatelet; and as ſhe knew how an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiouſly her huſband wiſhed to ſee Adeline, ſhe entreated her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to go thither. Adeline, though much harraſſed and fatigued, complied. When Louis returned from M. Nemour's, his father's advocate, whom he had haſtened to inform of her arrival, they all ſet out for the Chatelet. The view of the priſon into which they were now admitted ſo forcibly recalled to Adeline's mind the ſituation of Theodore, that ſhe with difficulty ſupported her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the apartment of La Motte. When he ſaw her, a gleam of joy paſſed over his countenance; but again relapſing into deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency, he looked mournfully at her, and then at Louis, and groaned deeply. Adeline, in whom all remembrance of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cruelty was loſt in his ſubſequent kindneſs, expreſſed her thankfulneſs for the life he had preſerved, and her anxiety to ſave him, in warm and repeated terms. But her gratitude evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſtreſſed him; inſtead of reconciling him to himſelf, it ſeemed to awaken a remembrance of the guilty deſigns he had once aſſiſted, and to ſtrike the pangs of conſcience deeper in his heart. Endeavouring to conceal his emotions, he entered on the ſubject of his preſent danger, and informed Adeline what teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony would be required of her on the trial. After above an hour's converſation with La Motte, ſhe returned to the lodgings of Madame, where, languid and ill, ſhe withdrew to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and tried to obliviate her anxieties in ſleep.</p>
                     <p>The parliament which conducted the trial re-aſſembled in a few days after the arrival of Adeline, and the two remaining witneſſes of the Marquis, on whom he now reſted his cauſe againſt La Motte, appeared. She was led trembling into the Court, where almoſt the firſt object that met her eyes was the Marquis de Montalt, whom ſhe now beheld with an emotion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely new to her, and which was ſtrongly tinctured with horror. When du Boſſe ſaw her, he immediately ſwore to her identity; his teſtimony was confirmed by her manner; for on perceiving him ſhe grew pale, and a univerſal tremor ſeized her. Jean d'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Aunoy could no where be found, and La Motte was thus depriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of an evidence which eſſentially effected his intereſt. Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, when called upon, gave her little narrative with clearneſs and preciſion; and Peter, who had conveyed her from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey ſupported the teſtimony ſhe offered. The evidence produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced was ſufficient to criminate the Marquis of the intention of murder, in the minds of moſt people preſent; but it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

On receiving this ſentence the unhappy crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fainted, and the compaſſion of the aſſembly, whoſe feelings had been unuſually intereſted in the deciſion, was expreſſed in a general groan.</p>
                     <p>Their attention was quickly called to a new object—it was Jean d'Aunoy who now entered the court. But his evidence, if it could ever, indeed, have been the means of ſaving La Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, came too late. He was reconducted to priſon; but Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, who, extremely ſhocked by his ſentence, was much indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, received orders to remain in the Court during the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of d'Aunoy. This man had been at length found in the priſon of a provincial town, where ſome of his creditors had thrown him, and from which even the money which the Marquis had remitted to him for the purpoſe of ſatisfying the craving importunities of du Boſſe, had been inſufficient to releaſe him. Meanwhile the revenge of the latter had been rouſed againſt the Marquis by an imaginary neglect, and the money which was deſigned to relieve his neceſſities was ſpent by de'Aunoy in rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous luxury.</p>
                     <p>He was confronted with Adeline and with du Boſſe, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to confeſs all he knew concerning this myſterious affair, or to undergo the torture. D'Aunoy, who was ignorant how far the ſuſpicions concerning the Marquis extended, and who was conſcious that his own words might condemn him, remained for ſometime obſtinately ſilent; but when the <hi>queſtion</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered his reſolution gave way, and he confeſſed a crime of which he had not even been ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>It appeared, that in the year 1642 d'Aunoy together with one Jacques Martigny, and Francis Balliere, had way-laid and ſeized, Henry Marquis de Montalt, half-brother to Phillipe; and after having robbed him, and bound his ſervant to a tree, according to the orders they bad received, they conveyed him to the Abbey of St. Clair, in the diſtant foreſt of Fontangville. Here he was confined for ſometime till farther directions were received from Phillipe de Montalt, the preſent Marquis who was then on his eſtates in a northern province of France. Theſe orders were for death, and the unfortunate Henry was aſſaſſinated in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> chamber in the third week of his confinement at the Abbey.</p>
                     <p>On hearing this Adeline grew faint; ſhe remembered the M S. ſhe had found, together with the extraordinary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:029379_0156_0FE08EB38557DBE0"/>
that had attended to the diſcovery; every nerve thrilled with horror, and raiſing her eyes ſhe ſaw the countenance of the Marquis overſpread with the livid paleneſs of guilt. She endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, however, to arreſt her fleeting ſpirits while the man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in his confeſſion.</p>
                     <p>When the murder was perpetrated, d'Aunoy had returned to his employer who gave him the reward agreed upon, and in a few months after delivered into his hands the infant daughter of the late Marquis, whom he conveyed to a diſtant part of the kingdom, where aſſuming the name of St. Pierre, he brought her up as his own child, receiving from the preſent Marquis a conſiderable annuity for his ſecrecy.</p>
                     <p>Adeline, no longer able to ſtruggle with the tumult of emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that now ruſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed upon her heart, uttered a deep ſigh and fainted away. She was carried from the Court, and, when the confuſion occaſioned by this circumſtance ſubſided, Jean d'Aunoy went on. He related, that on the death of his wife, Adeline was placed in a convent, from whence ſhe was afterwards remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another, where, the Marquis had deſtined her to receive the vows. That her determined rejection of them had occaſioned him to reſolve upon her death, and that ſhe had accordingly been removed to the houſe on the heath. D'Aunoy added, that by the Marquis's order he had miſlead du Boſſe with a falſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her birth. Having after ſometime diſcovered that his comrades had deceived him concerning her death, d'Aunoy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from them in enmity; but they unanimouſly determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to conceal her eſcape from the Marquis, that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the recompenſe of their ſuppoſed crime. Some months ſubſequent to this period, however, d'Aunoy received a letter from the Marquis, charging him with the truth and promiſing him a large reward if he would confeſs where he had placed Adeline. In conſequence of this letter he acknowledged that ſhe had been given into the hands of a ſtranger: but who he was, or where he lived, was not known.</p>
                     <p>Upon theſe depoſitions Phillipe de Montalt was committed to take his trial for the murder of Henry, his brother; d'Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy was thrown into a dungeon of the Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>elet, and du Boſſe was bound to appear as evidence.</p>
                     <p>The feelings of the Marquis, who, in a proſecution ſtimulated by revenge, had thus unexpectedly expoſed his crimes to the public eye, and betrayed himſelf to juſtice, can only be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The paſſions which had tempted him to the commiſſion of a crime ſo horrid as that of murder—and what, if poſſible,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:029379_0156_0FE08EB38557DBE0"/>
heightened its atrocity, the murder of one connected with him by the ties of blood, and by the habits of even infantine aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation—the paſſions which had ſtimulated him to ſo monſtrous a deed were ambition and the love of pleaſure. The firſt was more immediately gratified by the title of his brother; the latter by the riches which would enable him to indulge his voluptuous inclinations.</p>
                     <p>The late Marquis de Montalt, the father of Adeline, received from his Anceſtors a patrimony very inadequate to ſupport the ſplendor of his rank; but he had married the heireſs of an illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious family, whoſe fortune amply ſupplied the deficiency of his own. He had the misfortune to loſe her, for ſhe was amiable and beautiful, ſoon after the birth of a daughter, and it was then, that the preſent Marquis formed the diabolical deſign of deſtroying his brother. The contraſt of their characters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that cordial regard between them which their near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationſhip ſeemed to demand. Henry was benevolent, mild, and contemplative. In his heart reigned the love of virtue; in his manners the ſtrictneſs of juſtneſs was tempered, not weakened, by mercy; his mind was enlarged by ſcience, and adorned by elegant literature. The character of Phillipe has been already delineated in his actions; its nicer ſhades were blendid with ſome ſhining tints; but theſe ſerved only to render more ſtriking by contraſt the general darkneſs of the portrait.</p>
                     <p>He had married a lady, who, by the death of her brother, inherited conſiderable eſtates, of which the Abbey of St. Clair, and the villa on the borders of the foreſt of Fontangville, were the chief. His paſſion for mignificence and diſſipation, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſoon involved him in difficulties, and pointed out to him the conveniency of poſſeſſing his brother's wealth. His brother and his infant daughter only ſtood between him and his wiſhes; how he removed the father has been already related; why he did not employ the ſame means to ſecure the child, ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſurpriſing, unleſs we admit that a deſtiny hung over him on this occaſion, and that ſhe was ſuffered to live as an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to puniſh the murderer of her parent. When a retroſpect is taken of the viciſſitudes and dangers to which ſhe had been expoſed from her earlieſt infancy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> appears as if her preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was the effect of ſomething more than human policy, and affords a ſtriking inſtance that <hi>juſtice,</hi> however long delayed, will overtake the guilty.</p>
                     <p>While the late unhappy Marquis was ſuffering at the Abbey, his brother, who, to avoid ſuſpicion, remained in the north of
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:029379_0157_0FE08EB854BBB570"/>
France, delayed the execution of his horrid purpoſe from a tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idity natural to a mind not yet inured to enormous guilt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dared to deliver his final orders he waited to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtory he contrived to propagate of his brother's death would veil his crime from ſuſpicion. It ſucceeded but too well; for the ſervent whoſe life had been ſpared, that he might relate the tale, naturally enough concluded that his Lord had been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Banditti; and the peaſant, who a few hours after found the ſervant, bleeding, and bound to a tree, and knew alſo that this ſpot was infeſted by robbers, as naturally believed him, and ſpread the report accordingly.</p>

                        </gap> this period the Marquis, to whom the Abbey of Saint Clair belonged in right of his wife, viſited it only twice, and that at diſtant times, till after an interval of ſeveral years he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally found La Motte its inhabitant. He reſided at Paris, and on his eſtate in the north, except that once a year, he uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed a month at his delightful villa on the borders of the foreſt. In the buſy ſcenes of the Court, and in the diſſipations of pleaſure, he tried to loſe the remembrance of his guilt; but there were times when the voice of conſcience would be heard, though it was ſoon again loſt in the tumult of the world.</p>
                     <p>It was probable, that on the night of his abrupt departure from the Abbey, the ſolitary ſilence and gloom of the hour, in a place which had been the ſcene of his former crime, called up the remembrance of his brother with a force too powerful for fancy, and awakened horrors which compelled him to quit the polluted ſpot. If it was ſo, it is however certain that the ſpectres of conſcience vaniſhed with the darkneſs; for on the following day he returned to the Abbey, though it may be obſerved, he never attempted to paſs another night there. But though terror was rouſed for a tranſient moment, neither pity or repentance ſucceeded, ſince when the diſcovery of Adeline's birth excited apprehenſion for his own life, he did not heſitate to repeat the crime, and would again have ſtained his ſoul with human blood. This diſcovery was effected by means of a ſeal, bearing the arms of her mother's family, which was impreſſed on the note his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had found, and had delivered to him at Caux. It may be remembered, that having read this note, he was throwing it from him in the fury of jealouſy; but that after examining it again, it was carefully depoſited in his pocket book. The violent agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which a ſuſpicion of this terrible truth occaſioned, deprived him for a while of all power to act. When he was well enough to write he diſpatched a letter to d'Aunoy, the purport of which
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:029379_0157_0FE08EB854BBB570"/>
has been already mentioned. From d'Aunoy he received the confirmation of his fears. Knowing that his life muſt pay the forfeiture of his crime, ſhould Adeline ever obtain a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her birth, and not daring again to confide in the ſecrecy of a man who had once deceived him, he reſolved, after ſome deliberation, on her death. He immediately ſet out for the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, and gave thoſe directions concerning her which terror for his own ſafety, ſtill more than a deſire of retaining her eſtates ſuggeſted.</p>
                     <p>As the hiſtory of the ſeal which revealed the birth of Adeline is rather remarkable, it may not be amiſs to mention, that it was ſtolen from the Marquis, together with a gold watch by Jean d'Aunoy: the watch was ſoon diſpoſed of, but the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WE now return to the courſe of the narrative, and to Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, who was carried from the court to the lodging of Madame de la Motte. Madame was, however, at the Chatelet with her huſband, ſuffering all the diſtreſs which the ſentence pronounced againſt him might be ſuppoſed to inflect. The feeble frame of Adeline, ſo long harraſſed by grief and fatigue, almoſt ſunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the agitation which the diſcovery of her birth excited. Her feelings on this occaſion were too complex to be analyſed. From an orphan ſubſiſting on the bounty of others, without family, with few friends, and purſued by a cruel and powerful enemy, ſhe ſaw herſelf ſuddenly transformed to the daughter of an illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious houſe, and the heireſs of immenſe wealth. But ſhe learned alſo that her father had been murdered—murdered in the prime of his days—murdered by means of his brother, againſt whom ſhe muſt now appear, and in puniſhing the deſtroyer of her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent doom her uncle to death.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe remembered the manuſcript ſo ſingularly found, and conſidering that when ſhe wept for the ſufferings it deſcribed, her tears had flowed for thoſe of her father, her emotion cannot

eaſily be imagined. The circumſtances attending the diſcovery of theſe papers no longer appeared to be a work of chance, but of a Power whoſe deſigns are great and juſt. "O my father!" ſhe would exclaim, "your laſt wiſh is fulfilled—the pitying heart you wiſhed might trace your ſufferings ſhall avenge them."</p>
                     <p>On the return of Madame La Motte Adeline endeavoured as uſual, to ſuppreſs her own emotions, that ſhe might ſooth the affliction of her friend. She related what had paſſed in the courts after the departure of La Motte, and thus excited, even in the ſorrowful heart of Madame, a momentary gleam of ſatisfaction. Adeline determined to recover, if poſſible, the manuſcript.

                        </gap>ts appearance might be of importance on the approaching trial: ſhe determined however, if ſhe ſhould receive her rights, to have the manuſcript ſought for.</p>
                     <p>In the evening Louis joined this mournful party: he came immediately from his father, whom he left more tranquil than he had been ſince the fatal ſentence was pronounced. After a ſilent and melancholy ſupper they ſeparated for the night, and Adeline, in the ſolitude of her chamber, had leiſure to meditate on the diſcoveries of this eventful day. The ſufferings of her dead father, ſuch as ſhe had read them recorded by his <hi>own hand,</hi> preſſed moſt forcibly to her thoughts. The narrative had formerly ſo much affected her heart, and intereſted her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that her memory now faithfully reflected each particular circumſtance there diſcloſed. But when ſhe conſidered that ſhe had been in the very chamber where her parent had ſuffered, where even his life had been ſacrificed, and that ſhe had probably ſeen the very dagger, ſeen it ſtained with ruſt, the ruſt of blood! by which he had fallen, the anguiſh and horror of her mind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all controul.</p>
                     <p>On the following day Adeline received orders to prepare for the proſecution of the Marquis de Montalt, which was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence as ſoon as the requiſite witneſſes could be collected. Among theſe were the Abbeſs of the convent, who had received her from the hands of d'Aunoy; Madame La Motte, who was preſent when Du Boſſe compelled her huſband to receive Adeline; and Peter, who had not only been witneſs to this circumſtance, but who had conveyed her from the Abbey that ſhe might eſcape the deſigns of the Marquis. La Motte, and Theodore La Luc were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitated by the ſentence of the law from appearing on the trial.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="unknown:029379_0158_0FE08EC6E0514508"/>When La Motte was informed of the diſcovery of Adeline's birth, and that her father had been murdered at the Abbey of St. Clair, he inſtantly remembered, and mentioned to his wife, the ſkeleton he found in the ſtone room leading to the ſubterranean cells. Neither of them doubted, from the ſituation in which it lay, hid in a cheſt in an obſcure room ſtrongly guarded, that La Motte had ſeen the remains of the late Marquis. Madame, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, determined not to ſhock Adeline with the mention of this circumſtance till it ſhould be neceſſary to declare it on the trial.</p>
                     <p>As the time of the trial drew near, the diſtreſs and agitation of Adeline increaſed. Though juſtice demanded the life of the murderer, and though the tenderneſs and pity which the idea of a father called forth, urged her to avenge his death, ſhe could not without horror, conſider herſelf as the inſtrument of diſpenſing that juſtice which would deprive a fellow-being of exiſtence; and there were times when ſhe wiſhed the ſecret of her birth had never been revealed. If this ſenſibility was, in her peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, a weakneſs it was at leaſt an amiable one, and as ſuch deſerves to be reverenced.</p>
                     <p>The accounts ſhe received from Vaceau of the health of M. La Luc did not contribute to tranquillize her mind. The ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms deſcribed by Clara ſeemed to ſay that he was in the laſt ſtage of a conſumption, and the grief of Theodore and herſelf on this occaſion was expreſſed in her letters with the lively eloquence ſo natural to her. Adeline loved and revered La Luc for his own worth and for the parental tenderneſs he had ſhewed her, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and her concern for his declining ſtate was not inferior to that of his children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was increaſed by the reflection that ſhe had proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly been the means of ſhortening his life, for ſhe too well knew the diſtreſs occaſioned him by the ſituation in which it had been her misfortune to involve Theodore, had ſhattered his frame to its preſent infirmity. The ſame cauſe alſo withheld him from ſeeking in the climate of Montpellier the relief he had formerly been taught to expect there. When ſhe looked round on the condition of her friends, her heart was almoſt overwhelmed with the proſpect; it ſeemed as if ſhe was deſtined to involv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> all thoſe moſt dear to her in calamity. With reſpect to La Motte, whatever were his vices, and whatever the deſigns in which he had formerly engaged againſt her, ſhe forgot them all in the ſervice he had finally rendered her, and conſidered it to be as much her duty, as ſhe felt it to be her inclination, to intercede in his behalf. This, however, in her preſent ſituation ſhe could not do with any hope of ſucceſs; but if the ſuit, upon which
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:029379_0159_0FE08ECB72C07650"/>
depended the eſtabliſhment of her rank, her fortune, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently her influence, ſhould be decided in her favour, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to throw herſelf at the king's feet, and when ſhe plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe of Theodore, aſk the life of La Motte.</p>
                     <p>A few days preceding that of the trial, Adeline was informed a ſtranger deſired to ſpeak with her, and on going to the room where he was, ſhe found M. Verneuil. Her countenance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed both ſurpriſe and ſatisfaction at this unexpected meeting, and ſhe inquired, though with little expectation of an affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, if he had heard of M. La Luc. "I have ſeen him" ſaid M. Verneuil; "I am juſt come from Vaceau. But I am ſorry I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give you a better account of his health. He is greatly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſince I ſaw him before."</p>
                     <p>Adeline could ſcarcely refrain from tears at the recollection theſe words revived of the calamities which had occaſioned this lamented change. M. Verneuil delivered her a packet from Clara; as he preſented it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e ſaid, "Beſide this introduction to your notice, I have a claim of a different kind, which I am proud to aſſert, and which will perhaps juſtify the permiſſion I aſk of ſpeaking upon your affairs." Adeline bowed, and M. Verneuil, with a countenance expreſſive of the moſt tender ſolicitude, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he had heard of the late proceeding of the parliament of Paris, and of the diſcoveries that ſo intimately concerned her. "I know not," continued he, "whether I ought to congratulate or condole with you on this trying occaſion. That I ſincerely ſympathize in all that concerns you I hope you will believe, and I cannot deny myſelf the pleaſure of telling you that I am related though diſtantly to the late Marchioneſs, your mother, for that ſhe <hi>was your mother</hi> I cannot doubt."</p>
                     <p>Adeline <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oſe haſtily and advanced towards M. Verneuil; ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and ſatisfaction reanimated her features. "Do I indeed ſee a relation?" ſaid ſhe in a ſweet and tremulous voice, "and one whom I can welcome as a friend?" Tears trembled in her eyes; and ſhe received M. Verneuil's embrace in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was ſometime before her emotion would permit her to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>To Adeline, who from her earlieſt infancy had been abandoned to ſtrangers, a forlorn and helpleſs orphan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had never till lately known a relation, and who then found one in the perſon of an inveterate enemy, to her this diſcovery was as delightful as unexpected. But after ſtruggling for ſometime with the various emotions that preſſed upon her heart, ſhe begged M. Verneuil permiſſion to withdraw till ſhe could recover compoſure. He would have taken leave, but ſhe entreated him not to go.</p>
                     <p>The intereſt which M. Verneuil took in the concerns of La Luc, which was ſtrengthened by his increaſing regard for Clara, had
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:029379_0159_0FE08ECB72C07650"/>
drawn him to Vaceau, where he was informed of the family and peculiar circumſtances of Adeline. On receiving this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he immediately ſet out for Paris to offer his protection and aſſiſtance to his newly diſcovered relation, and to aid, if poſſible, the cauſe of Theodore.</p>
                     <p>Adeline in a ſhort time returned, and could then bear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe on the ſubject of her family. M. Verneuil offered her his ſupport and aſſiſtance, if they ſhould be found neceſſary. "But I truſt," added he, to the juſtneſs of your cauſe, and hope it will not require any adventitious aid. To thoſe who remember the late Marchioneſs, your features brings ſufficient evidence of your birth. As a proof that my judgment in this inſtance is not bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed by prejudice, the reſemblance ſtruck me when I was in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, though I knew the Marchioneſs only by her portrait; and I believe I mentioned to M. La Luc that you often reminded me of a deceaſed relation. You may form ſome judgment of this yourſelf, added M. Verneuil, taking a miniature from his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. "This was your amiable mother."</p>
                     <p>Adeline's countenance changed; ſhe received the picture eagerly, gazed on it for a long time in ſilence, and her eyes fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tears. It was not the reſemblance ſhe ſtudied but the countenance—the mild and beautiful countenance of her parent, whoſe blue eyes full of tender ſweetneſs, ſeemed bent upon her's; while a ſoft ſmile played on her lips; Adeline preſſed the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to her's, and again gazed in ſilent reverie. At length, with a deep ſigh, ſhe ſaid, "This ſurely <hi>was</hi> my mother. Had ſhe <hi>but</hi> lived, O my poor father! you had been ſpared." This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection quite overcame her, and ſhe burſt into tears. M. Verneuil did not interrupt her grief, but took her hand and ſat by her without ſpeaking till ſhe became more compoſed. Again kiſſing the picture, ſhe held it out to him with a heſitating look. "No," ſaid he, "it is already with its true owner." She thanked him with a ſmile of ineffable ſweetneſs, and after ſome converſation on the ſubject of the approaching trial, on which occaſion ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted M. Verneuil would ſupport her by his preſence, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, having begged leave to repeat his viſit on the following day.</p>
                     <p>Adeline now opened her packet, and ſaw once more the well-known characters of Theodore; for a moment ſhe felt as if in his preſence, and the conſcious bluſh o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>This hope, though but faintly expreſſed, and written evidently for the purpoſe of conſoleing Adeline, did not entirely fail of the deſired effect.

                     <p>THE day of the trial ſo anxiouſly awaited, and on which the fate of ſo many perſons depended, at length arrived. Adeline, accompanied by M. Verneuil and Madame la Motte, appeared as the proſecutor of the Marquis de Montalt; and d'Aunoy, du Boſſe, Louis de la Motte, and ſeveral other perſons, as witneſs in her cauſe. The judges were ſome of the moſt diſtinguiſhed in France; and the advocates on both ſides men of eminent abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. On a trial of ſuch importance, the court, as may be imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined, crowded with perſons of diſtinction, and the ſpectacle it preſented was ſtrikingly ſolemn, yet magnificent.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe appeared before the tribunal, Adeline's emotion ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed all the arts of diſguiſe, but adding to the natural dignity of her air an expreſſion of ſoft timidity, and to her downcaſt eyes a ſweet confuſion, it rendered her an object ſtill more intereſting; and ſhe attracted the univerſal pity and admiration of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly When ſhe ventured to raiſe her eyes, ſhe perceived that the Marquis was not yet in the court, and while ſhe awaited his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in trembling expectation, a confuſed murmuring aroſe in a diſtant part of the hall. Her ſpirits now almoſt forſook her; the certainty of ſeeing immediately, and conſciouſly, the murderer of her father, chilled her with horror, and ſhe was with difficulty preſerved from fainting. A low ſound now ran through the
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:029379_0160_0FE08ED990716960"/>
court, and an air of confuſion appeared, which was ſoon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the tribunal itſelf. Several of the members aroſe, ſome left the hall, the whole place exhibited a ſcene of diſorder, and a report at length reached Adeline that the Marquis de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talt was dying. A conſiderable time elapſed in uncertainty; but the confuſion continued; The Marquis did not appear; and at Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line's requeſt M. V— went in queſt of more poſitive information.</p>
                     <p>He followed a crowd which was hurrying towards the Chate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and with ſome difficulty gained admittance into the priſon; but the porter at the gate, whom he had bribed for a paſſport, could give him no certain information on the ſubject of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, and not being at liberty to quit his poſt, furniſhed M. Verneuil with only a vague direction to the Marquis's apartment. The courts were ſilent and deſerted, but as he advanced a diſtant h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m of voices led him on, till perceiving ſeveral perſons running towards a ſtaircaſe which appeared beyond the archway of a long paſſage, he followed thither, and learned that the Marquis was certainly dying. The ſtaircaſe was filled with people; he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to preſs through the crowd, and after much ſtruggle and difficulty he reached the door of an anti-room which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the apartment where the Marquis lay, and whence ſeveral perſons now iſſued. Here he learned that the object of his inquiry was already dead. M. Verneuil, however, preſſed through the anti-room to the chamber where lay the Marquis on a bed ſurrounded by officers of the law, and two notaries, who appeared to have been taking down depoſitions. His countenance was ſuffuſed with a black, and deadly hue, and impreſſed with the horrors of death; M. Verneuil turned away, ſhocked by the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle, and on inquiry heard that the Marquis had died by poiſon.</p>
                     <p>It appeared that convinced he had nothing to hope from his trial, he had taken this method of avoiding an ignominious death. In the laſt hours of life, while tortured with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his crime, he reſolved to make all the atonement that remained for him, and having ſwallowed the potion, he immediately ſent for a confeſſor, to take a full confeſſion of his guilt, and two notaries, and thus eſtabliſhed Adeline beyond diſpute in the rights of her birth; and alſo bequeathed her a conſiderable legacy.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of theſe depoſitions ſhe was ſoon after formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledged as the daughter and heireſs of Henry Marquis de Montalt, and the rich eſtates of her father were reſtored to her. She immediately threw herſelf at the feet of the king in behalf of Theodore and of La Motte.

This kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs operated ſo powerfully upon his heart, which had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed through weakneſs rather than natural depravity, and awakened ſo keen a remorſe for the injuries he had once medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated againſt a benefactreſs ſo noble, that his former habits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came odious to him, and his character gradually recovered the hue which it would probably always have worn had he never been expoſed to the tempting diſſipations of Paris.</p>
                     <p>The paſſion which Louis had ſo long owned for Adeline was raiſed almoſt to adoration by her late conduct; but he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed even the faint hope which he had hitherto almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſciouſly cheriſhed, and, ſince the life which was granted to Theodore rendered this ſacrifice neceſſary, he could not repine. He reſolved, however, to ſeek in abſence the tranquillity he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o deſervedly dear to him.</p>
                     <p>On the eve of his departure La Motte and his family took a very affecting leave of Adeline; he left Paris for England, where it was his deſign to ſettle; and Louis, who was eager to fly from her enchantments, ſet out on the ſame day for his regiment.</p>
                     <p>Adeline remained ſometime at Paris to ſettle her affairs, where ſhe was introduced by M. V— to the few and diſtant relations that remained of her family. Among theſe were the Count and Counteſs D—, and the Mon. Amand, who had ſo much engaged her pity and eſteem at Nice. The lady, whoſe death he lamented, was of the family of de Montalt; and the reſemblance which he had traced between her features and thoſe of Adeline, her couſin, was ſomething more than the effect of fancy. The death of his elder brother had abruptly recalled him
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:029379_0161_0FE08EDE25B26018"/>
from Italy; but Adeline had the ſatisfaction to obſerve that the heavy melancholy which formerly oppreſſed him, had yielded to a ſort of placid reſignation, and that his countenance was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enlivened by a tranſient gleam of cheerfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Count and Counteſs D—, who were much intereſted by her goodneſs and beauty, invited her to make their hotel her reſidence while ſhe remained at Paris.</p>
                     <p>Her firſt care was to have the remains of her parent removed from the Abbey of St. Clair, and depoſited in the vault of his anceſtors. D'Aunoy, was tried condemned and hanged for the murder. At the place of execution he had deſcribed the ſpot where the remains of the Marquis were concealed, which was in the ſtone room already mentioned, belonging to the Abbey. M. V— accompanied the officers appointed for the ſearch, and attended the aſhes of the Marquis to St. Maur, an eſtate in one of the northern provinces. There they were depoſited with the ſolemn funeral pomp becoming his rank. Adeline attended as chief mourner; and this laſt duty paid to the memory of her parent, ſhe became more tranquil and reſigned. The M S. that recorded his ſufferings had been found at the Abbey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to her by M. Verneuil and ſhe preſerved it with the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enthuſiaſm ſo ſacred a relique deſerved.</p>
                     <p>On her return to Paris, Theodore La Luc, who was come from Montpellier, awaited her arrival. The happineſs of this meeting was clouded by the account he brought of his father, whoſe extreme danger had alone withheld him from haſtening the moment he obtained his liberty, to thank Adeline for the life ſhe had preſerved. She now received him as the friend to whom ſhe was indebted for her preſervation, and as the lover who deſerved, and poſſeſt her tendereſt affection. The remembrance of the circumſtances under which they had laſt met, and of their mutual anguiſh, rendered more exquiſite the happineſs of the preſent moments, when no longer oppreſſed by the horrid proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ignominious death and final ſeparation, they looked forward only to the ſmiling days that awaited them when hand in hand they ſhould tread the flowery ſcenes of life. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt which memory drew of the paſt with the preſent, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew tears of tenderneſs and gratitude to their eyes, and the ſweet ſmile which ſeemed ſtruggling to diſpel from the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Adeline thoſe gems of ſorrow, penetrated the heart of Theodore, and brought to his recollection a little ſong which in other circumſtances he had formerly ſung to her. He took up a lute that lay on the table, and touching the dulcet chords, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied it with the following words:

                     <p>Her affection for Theodore had induced Adeline to reject ſeveral ſuitors which her goodneſs, beauty and wealth, had already attracted, and whom though infinitely his ſuperiors in point of fortune, were many of them inferior to him in family, and all of them in merit.</p>
                     <p>The various and tumultuous emotions which the late events had called forth in the boſom of Adeline were now ſubſided; but the memory of her father ſtill tinctured her mind with a melancholy that time only could ſubdue; and ſhe refuſed to liſten to the ſupplications of Theodore till the period ſhe had preſcribed for her mourning ſhould be expired. The neceſſity of rejoining his regiment obliged him to leave Paris within the fortnight after his arrival; but he carried with him aſſurance of receiving her hand ſoon after ſhe ſhould lay aſide her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>able habit, and departed therefore with tolerable compoſure.</p>
                     <p>M. La Luc's very precarious ſtate was a ſource of inceſſant diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etude to Adeline, and ſhe determined to accompany M. V—, who was now the declared lover of Clara, to Montpellier, whither La Luc had immediately gone on the liberation of his ſon. For this journey ſhe was preparing when ſhe received from her friend a flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account of his amendment; and as ſome farther ſettlement of her affairs required her preſence at Paris, ſhe deferred her deſign, and M.

                     <p>When Theodore's affairs aſſumed a more favourable aſpect, M. Verneuil had written to La Luc, and communicated to him the ſecret of his heart reſpecting Clara. La Luc who admired and eſteemed M. V—, and who was not ignorant of his family connections, was pleaſed with the propoſed alliance; Clara thought ſhe had never ſeen any perſon whom ſhe was ſo much inclined to love; and M. V— received an anſwer favourable to his wiſhes, and which encouraged him to undertake the preſent journey to Montpellier.</p>
                     <p>The reſtoration of his happineſs and the climate of Montpellier did all for the health of La Luc that his moſt anxious friends could wiſh, and he was at length ſo far recovered as to viſit Adeline at her eſtate of St. Maur. Clara and M. V— accompanied him, and a ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of hoſtilities between France and Spain ſoon after permitted Theodore to join this happy party.

                     <p>ADELINE, in the ſociety of friends ſo beloved, loſt the impreſſion of that melancholy which the fate of her parent had occaſioned; ſhe recovered all her natural vivacity; and when ſhe threw off the mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing habit which filial piety had required her to aſſume, ſhe gave her hand to Theodore. The nuptials, which were celebrated at St. Maur, were graced by the preſence of the Count and Counteſs D—, and La Luc had the ſupreme felicity of confirming on the ſame day the flattering deſtines of both his children. When the ceremony was ever he bleſſed and embraced them all with tears of fatherly affection. "I thank thee O God! that I have been permitted to ſee this hour;" ſaid he, "whenever it ſhall pleaſe thee to call me hence, I ſhall depart in peace."</p>
                     <p>"Long, very long, may you be ſpared to bleſs your children," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Adeline. Clara kiſſed her father's hand and wept: "Long, very long," ſhe repeated in a voice ſcarcely audible. La Luc ſmi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſs affecting.</p>
                     <p>But the time now drew nigh when La Luc thought it neceſſary to return to the duties of his pariſh, from which he had ſo long been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Madame La Luc too, who had attended him during the period of his danger at Montpellier, and hence returned to Savoy, complained much of the ſolitude of her life; and this was with her brother an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional motive for his ſpeedy departure. Theodore and Adeline, who could not ſupport the thought of a ſeparation, endeavoured <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o perſuade him to give up his chateau, and to reſide with them in France; but he was held by many ties to Leloncourt. For many years he had conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the comfort and happineſs of his pariſhioners; they revered and loved him as a father; he regarded them with an affection little ſhort of parental. The attachment they diſcovered towards him on his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not forgotten either; it had made a deep impreſſion on his mind, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e could not bear the thought of forſaking them now that Heaven had ſhowered on him its abundance. "It is ſweet to live for them," ſaid he, "and I will alſo die amongſt them." A ſentiment alſo of a more tender nature: (and let not the Stoic prophane it with the name of weakneſs, or the man of the world ſcorn it as unnatural) a ſentiment ſtill more tender attracted him to Leloncourt: the remains of his wife repoſed there.</p>
                     <p>Since La Luc would not reſide in France, Theodore and Adeline, to whom the ſplendid gaieties that courted them at Paris were very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior temptations to the ſweet domeſtic pleaſures and refined ſociety which Leloncourt would afford, determined to accompany La Luc and Mon. and Madame Verneuil abroad. Adeline arranged her affairs
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:029379_0163_0FE08EF09A57D5E0"/>
ſo as to render her reſidence in France unneceſſary; and having bade an affectionate adieu to the Count and Counteſs D—, and to M. Amand, who had recovered a tolerable degree of cheerfulneſs, ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with her friends for Savoy.</p>
                     <p>They travelled leiſurely, and frequently turned out of their way to view whatever was worthy of obſervation. After a long and pleaſant journey they came once more within view of the Swiſs mountains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſight of which revived a thouſand intereſting recollections in the mind of Adeline. She remembered the circumſtances and ſenſations under which ſhe had firſt ſeen them; when an orphan, flying from perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſeek ſhelter among ſtrangers, and loſt to the only perſon on earth whom ſhe loved: ſhe remembered this, and the contraſt of the preſent moment ſtruck with all its force upon her heart.</p>
                     <p>The countenance of Clara brightened into ſmiles, of the moſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated delight as ſhe drew near the beloved ſcenes of her infant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and Theodore often looked from the windows, caught with patriotic enthuſiaſm the magnificent and changing ſcenery which the receding mountains ſucceſſively diſcloſed.</p>
                     <p>It was evening when they approached within a few miles of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ncourt, and the road winding round the foot of a ſtupendous cragg, preſented them a full view of the lake, and of the peaceful dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of La Luc. An exclamation of joy from the whole party announced the diſcovery, and the glance of pleaſure was reflected from every eye. The ſun's laſt light gleamed upon the waters that repoſed in "chryſtal purity" below, mellowed every feature of the landſcape, and touched with purple ſplendour the clouds that rolled along the mountain tops.</p>
                     <p>La Luc welcomed his family to his happy home, and ſent up a ſilent thankſgiving that he was permitted thus to return to it. Adeline con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to gaze upon each well-known object, and again reflecting on the viciſſitudes of grief and joy, and the ſurpriſing change of fortune which ſhe had experienced ſince laſt ſhe ſaw them, her heart dilated with gratitude and complacent delight. She looked at Theodore, whom, in theſe very ſcenes ſhe had lamented as loſt to her for ever; who when found again, was about to be torn from her by an ignominious death, but who now ſat by her ſide, her ſecure and happy huſband, the pride of his family and herſelf; and while the ſenſibility of her heart flowed in tears from her eyes, a ſmile of ineffable tenderneſs told him all ſhe felt. He gently preſſed her hand, and anſwered her with a look of love.</p>
                     <p>Peter, who now rode up to the carriage with a face full of joy and of importance, interrupted a courſe of ſentiment which was become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt too intereſting. "Ah! my dear maſter!" cried he, "welcome home again. Here is the village<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God bleſs it! It is worth a million ſuch places as Paris. Thank St. Jacques, we are all come ſafe back!"</p>
                     <p>This effuſion of honeſt Peter's joy was received and anſwered with the kindneſs it deſerved. As they drew near the lake muſic ſounded over the water, and they preſently ſaw a large party of the villagers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled on the green ſpot that ſloped to the very margin of the waves, and dancing in all their holiday finery. It was in the evening of a feſtival. The elder peaſants ſat under the ſhade of the trees that crowned this little eminence, eating milk and fruits, and watching their ſons and daughters friſk it away to the ſprightly notes of the tabor and pipe, which was joined by the ſofter tones of a mandolin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="167" facs="unknown:029379_0163_0FE08EF09A57D5E0"/>The ſcene was highly intereſting, and what added to its pictureſque beauty, was a group of cattle that ſtood, ſome on the brink, ſome half in the water and others repoſing on the green bank, while ſeveral pleaſant girls, dreſſed in the neat ſimplicity of their country, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing the milky feaſt. Peter now rode on firſt, and a crowd ſoon collected round him, who learning that their beloved maſter was at band, went forth to meat and welcome him. Their warm and honeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of joy diffuſed an exquiſite ſatisfaction over the heart of the good La Luc, who met them with the kindneſs of a father, and who could ſcarcely forbear ſhedding tears to this teſtimony of their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When the younger part of the peaſants heard the news of his arrival, the general joy was ſuch, that, led by the tabor and pipe, they danced before his carriage to the chateau, where they again welcomed him and his family with the enlivening ſtrains of muſic. At the gate of the chateau they were received by Madame La Luc, and a happier party never met.</p>
                     <p>As the evening was uncommonly mild and beautiful, ſupper was ſpread in the garden. When the repaſt was over, Clara, whoſe heart was all glee, propoſed a dance by moonlight. "It will be delicious," ſaid ſhe; "the moonbeams are already dancing on the waters. See what a ſtream of radiance they throw acroſs the lake, and how they ſparkle round that little promontory on the left. The freſhneſs of the hour too invites to dancing."</p>
                     <p>They all agreed to the propoſal—"And let the good people who have ſo heartily welcomed us home be called in too," ſaid La Luc: "they ſhall <hi>all</hi> partake of our happineſs. There is devotion in making others happy, and gratitude ought to make us devout. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, bring more wine, and ſet ſome tables under the trees." Peter flew, and, while chairs and tables were placing, Clara ran for her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite lute, the lute which had formerly afforded her ſuch delight, and which Adeline had often touched with a melancholy expreſſion. Clara's light hand now ran over the chords, and drew forth tones of tender ſweetneſs, her voice accompanying the following:
