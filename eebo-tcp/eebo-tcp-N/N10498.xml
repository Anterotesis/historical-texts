            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE To the READER.</head>
            <p>THIS account of the life and spiritual experience of <hi>James Albert,</hi> was taken from his own mouth, and committed to paper by the elegant pen of a young <hi>Lady</hi> of the town of <hi>Leominster,</hi> for her own private satisfaction, and without any intention, at first, that it should be made public. But she has now been prevailed on to commit it to the press, both with a view to serve <hi>Albert</hi> and his distressed family, who have the sole profits arising from the sale of it; and likewise, as it is apprehended, this little history contains matter well worthy the notice and attention of every Christian reader.</p>
            <p>Perhaps we have here, in some degree, a solution of that question that has perplex'd the minds of so many serious persons, viz. In what manner will God deal with those benighted parts of the world where the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Jesus Christ hath never reached? Now, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from the experience of this remarkable person, that God does not save without the knowledge of the truth; but, with respect to those whom he hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, though born under every outward disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and in the regions of the grossest darkness and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, he most amazingly acts upon, and influences,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013311_0004_0F90F1EC307BB288"/>
their minds, and in the course of wisely and most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully appointed providence, he brings them to the means of spiritual information, gradually opens to their view the light of his truth, and gives them full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session and enjoyment of the inestimable blessings of his gospel Who can doubt but that the suggestion so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly press'd upon the mind of <hi>Albert</hi> (when a boy) that there was a Being superior to the sun, moon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and stars (the objects of African idolatry) came from the Father of lights, and was, with respect to him, the first fruit of the display of gospel glory? His long and perilous journey to the coast of <hi>Guinea,</hi> where he was sold for a slave, and so brought into a Christian land; shall we consider this as the alone effect of a curious and inquisitive disposition? Shall we, in accounting for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to nothing higher than mere chance &amp; accidental cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances? Whatever Infidels &amp; Deists may think, I trust the Christian reader will easily discern an all wise and omnipotent appointment and direction in these move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He belonged to the Redeemer of lost sinners; he was the purchase of his cross; and therefore the Lord undertook to bring him by a way he knew not, out of darkness into his marvellous light, that he might lead him to a saving heart-acquaintance and union with the triune God in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself; and not imputing their trespasses. As his call was very extraordinary, so there are certain parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars exceedingly remarkable in his experience. God has put singular honor upon him in the exercise of his faith and patience, which, in the most distressing and pitiable trials and calamities, have been found to the praise and glory of God. How deeply must it affect a tender heart, not only to be reduc'd to the last extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013311_0005_0F90F1F09A6CDCB0"/>
himself, but to have his wife and children perishing for want before his eyes! Yet his faith did not fail him; he put his trust in the Lord, and he was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And, at this instant, though born in an exalted station of life, and now under the Pressure of various afflicting Providences, I am persuaded (for I know the man) he would rather embrace the dunghill, having Christ in his heart, than give up his spiritual possessions and enjoyment, to fill the throne of Princes. It perhaps may not be amiss to observe, that <hi>James Albert</hi> left his native country (as near as I can guess from certain circumstances) when he was about <hi>15</hi> years old. He now appears to be turn'd of <hi>60;</hi> has a good natural understanding; is well acquainted with the scriptures, and the things of God; has an amiable and tender disposition; and his character can be well attested not only at <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> the place of his residence, but likewise by many creditable persons in London and other places.

            <head>An Account of <hi>James Albert,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I WAS born in the city of <hi>Baurnou,</hi> my mother was the eldest daughter of the reigning King there. I was the youngest of six children, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly loved by my mother, and my grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther almost doated on me.</p>
            <p>I had, from my infancy, a curious turn of mind; was more grave and reserved, in my disposition, than either of my brothers and sisters, I often teazed them with questions they could not answer; for which reason they disliked me, as they supposed that I was either foolish or insane. 'Twas certain that I was, at times, very unhappy in myself: It being strongly impressed on my mind that there was some GREAT MAN of power which resided above the sun, moon and stars, the objects of our worship.— My dear, indulgent mother would bear more with me than any of my friends beside.—I often raised my hand to heaven, and asked her who lived there? Was much dissatisfied when she told me the sun, moon and stars, being persuaded, in my own mind, that there must be some SUPERIOR POWER.—I was
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013311_0007_0F90F1F5DD3AAE68"/>
frequently lost in wonder at the works of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Was afraid, and uneasy, and restless, but could not tell for what. I wanted to be informed of things that no person could tell me; and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dissatisfied.—These wonderful impressions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in my childhood, and followed me continually till I left my parents, which affords me matter of admiration and thankfulness.</p>
            <p>To this moment I grew more and more uneasy every day, insomuch that one Saturday (which is the day on which we kept our sabbath) I laboured under anxieties and fears that cannot be expressed; and, what is more extraordinary, I could not give a reason for it.—I rose, as our custom is, about three o'clock (as we are obliged to be at our place of worship an hour before the sun rise) we say nothing in our worship, but continue on our knees with our hands held up, observing a strict silence till the sun is at a certain height, which I suppose to be about 10 or 11 o'clock in <hi>England:</hi> When, at a certain sign made by the Priest, we get up (our duty being over) and disperse to our different houses.—Our place of meeting is under a large palm tree; we divide our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into many congregations; as it is impossible for the same tree to cover the inhabitants of the whole city, though they are extremely large, high and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestic; the beauty and usefulness of them are not to be described; they supply the inhabitants of the country with meat, drink and clothes; <note n="*" place="bottom">It is a generally received opinion, in <hi>England,</hi> that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>Africa</hi> go entirely unclothed; but this supposition is very unjust: They have a kind of dress so as to appear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, though it is very slight and thin.</note> the body of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013311_0008_0F90F1F5FA7A2B48"/>
the palm tree is very large; at a certain season of the year they tap it, and bring vessels to receive the wine, of which they draw great quantities, the quality of which is very delicious: The leaves of this tree are of a silky nature; they are large and soft; when they are dried and pulled to pieces, it has much the same appearance as the English flax, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of BOURNOU manufacture it for clothing, &amp;c. This tree likewise produces a plant, or substance, which has the appearance of a cabbage, and very like it, in taste almost the same: It grows between the branches. Also the palm tree produces a nut, something like a cocoa, which contains a kernel, in which is a large quantity of milk, very pleasant to the taste: The shell is of a hard substance, and of a very beautiful appearance, and serves for basons, bowls, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I hope this digression will be forgiven.—I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to observe, that after the duty of our sabbath was over (on the day in which I was more distress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and afflicted than ever) we were all on our way home as usual, when a remarkable black cloud arose and covered the sun; then followed very heavy rain and thunder, more dreadful than ever I had heard: The heavens roared, and the earth trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at it: I was highly affected and cast down; insomuch that I wept sadly, and could not follow my relations &amp; friends home.—I was obliged to stop, and felt as if my legs were tied, they seemed to shake under me: So I stood still, being in great fear of the MAN of POWER, that I was persuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in myself, lived above. One of my young com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions (who entertained a particular friendship for
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013311_0009_0F90F1F6CB5323B0"/>
me, and I for him) came back to see for me: He asked me why I stood still in such very hard rain? I only said to him that my legs were weak, and I could not come faster: He was much affected to see me cry, and took me by the hand, and said he would lead me home, which he did. My mother was greatly alarmed at my tarrying out in such terrible weather; she asked me many questions, such as what I did so for? And if I was well? My dear mother, says I, pray tell me who is the GREAT MAN of POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER that makes the thunder? She said, there was no power but the sun, moon and stars; that they made all our country.—I then inquired how all our people came? She answered me, from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so carried me to many generations back. —Then says I, who made the <hi>first man?</hi> And who made the first cow, and the first lion, and where does the fly come from, as no one can make him? My mother seemed in great trouble; she was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive that my senses were impaired, or that I was foolish. My father came in, and seeing her in grief asked the cause, but when she related our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation to him he was exceedingly angry with me, and told me he would punish me severely if ever I was so troublesome again; so that I resolved never to say any thing more to him. But I grew very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in myself; my relations and acquaintance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, by all the means they could think on, to divert me, by taking me to ride upon goats (which is much the custom of our country) and to shoot with a bow and arrow; but I experienced no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction at all in any of these things; nor could I be easy by any means whatever: My parents were very
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013311_0010_0F90F1F77200B860"/>
unhappy to see me so dejected and melancholy.</p>
            <p>About this time there came a merchant from the <hi>Gold Coast</hi> (the third city in GUINEA) he traded with the inhabitants of our country in ivory, &amp;c. he took great notice of my unhappy situation, and inquired into the cause; he expressed vast concern for me, and said, if my parents would part with me for a little while, and let him take me home with him, it would be of more service to me than any thing they could do for me.—He told me that if I would go with him I should see houses with wings to them walk upon the water, and should also see the white folks; and that he had many sons of my age, which should be my companions; and he added to all this that he would bring me safe back again soon.—I was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleased with the account of this strange place, and was very desirous of going.—I seemed sensible of a secret impulse upon my mind, which I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, that seemed to tell me I must go. When my dear mother saw that I was willing to leave them, she spoke to my father and grandfather and the rest of my relations, who all agreed that I should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the merchant to the Gold Coast. I was the more willing as my brothers and sisters despised me, and looked on me with contempt on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my unhappy disposition; and even my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants slighted me, and disregarded all I said to them. I had one sister who was always exceeding fond of me, and I loved her entirely; her name was LOG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WY, she was quite white, and fair, with fine light hair, though my father and mother were black.—I was truly concerned to leave my beloved sister, and she cry'd most sadly to part with me, wringing her
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013311_0011_0F90F1F8494A4BC0"/>
hands, and discovered every sign of grief that can be imagined. Indeed if I could have known when I left my friends and country that I should never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to them again my misery on that occasion would have been inexpressible. All my relations were sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to part with me; my dear mother came with me upon a camel more than three hundred miles, the first of our journey lay chiefly through woods: At night we secured ourselves from the wild beasts by making fires all around us; we and our camels kept within the circle, or we must have been torn to pieces by the lions, and other wild creatures, that roared ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly as soon as night came on, and continued to do so till morning.—There can be little said in favour of the country through which we passed; only a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of marble that we came through which is unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably beautiful.—On each side of this valley are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly high and almost inaccessible mountains— Some of these pieces of marble are of prodigious length and breadth but of different sizes and colour, and shaped in a variety of forms, in a wonderful manner.—It is most of it veined with gold mixed with striking and beautiful colours; so that when the sun darts upon it, it is as pleasing a sight as can be imagined.—The merchant that brought me from BOURNOU was in partnership with another gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who accompanied us; he was very unwilling that he should take me from home, as, he said, he foresaw many difficulties that would attend my going with them.—He endeavoured to prevail on the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant to throw me into a very deep pit that was in the valley, but he refused to listen to him, and said, he was resolved to take care of me: But the other
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013311_0012_0F90F1F908155DD0"/>
was greatly dissatisfied; and when we came to a river, which we were obliged to pass through, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed throwing me in and drowning me; but the merchant would not consent to it, so that I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>
            <p>We travel'd till about four o'clock every day, and then began to make preparations for night, by cutting down large quantities of wood, to make fires to preserve us from the wild beasts.—I had a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy and discontented journey, being in continual fear that the people I was with would murder me. I often reflected with extreme regret on the kind friends I had left, and the idea of my dear mother frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drew tears from my eyes. I cannot recollect how long we were in going from <hi>Bournou</hi> to the <hi>Gold Coast</hi>; but as there is no shipping nearer to <hi>Bournou</hi> than that city, it was tedious in travelling so far by land, being upwards of a thousand miles.—I was heartily rejoiced when we arrived at the end of our journey: I now vainly imagined that all my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and inquietudes would terminate here; but could I have looked into futurity, I should have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I had much more to suffer than I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore experienced, and that they had as yet but barely commenced.</p>
            <p>I was now more than a thousand miles from home, without a friend or any means to procure one. Soon after I came to the merchant's house I heard the drums beat remarkably loud, and the trumpets blow —the persons accustom'd to this employ, are oblig'd to go upon a very high structure appointed for that purpose, that the sound might be heard at a great distance: They are higher than the steeples are in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013311_0013_0F90F1F9DD63D1A8"/>
               <hi>England.</hi> I was mightily pleased with sounds so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely new to me, and was very inquisitive to know the cause of this rejoicing, and asked many questions concerning it: I was answered that it was meant as a compliment to me, because I was grandson to the King of <hi>Bournou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This account gave me a secret pleasure; but I was not suffered long to enjoy this satisfaction, for, in the evening of the same day, two of the merchant's sons (boys about my own age) came running to me, and told me, that the next day I was to die, for the King intended to behead me.—I reply'd, that I was sure it could not be true, for that I came there to play with them, and to see houses walk upon the water, with wings to them, and the white folks; but I was soon informed that their King imagined I was sent by my father as a spy, and would make such discoveries, at my return home, that would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to make war with the greater advantage to ourselves; and for these reasons he had resolved I should never return to my native country.—When I heard this, I suffered misery that cannot be describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—I wished, a thousand times, that I had never left my friends and country.—But still the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was pleased to work miracles for me.</p>
            <p>The morning I was to die, I was washed and all my gold ornaments made bright and shining, and then carried to the palace, where the King was to behead me himself (as is the custom of the place).— He was seated upon a throne at the top of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding large yard, or court, which you must go through to enter the palace, it is as wide and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as a large field in <hi>England.</hi>—I had a lane of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013311_0014_0F90F1FA8FAC3118"/>
life-guards to go through.—I guessed it to be about three hundred paces.</p>
            <p>I was conducted by my friend, the merchant, about half way up; then he durst proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I went up to the King alone—I went with an undaunted courage, and it pleased God to melt the heart of the King, who sat with his scymitar in his hand ready to behead me; yet, being himself so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, he dropped it out of his hand, and took me upon his knee and wept over me. I put my right hand round his neck, and prest him to my heart.— He set me down and blest me; and added that he would not kill me, and that I should not go home, but be sold for a slave, so then I was conducted back again to the merchant's house.</p>
            <p>The next day he took me on board a French brig; the Captain did not chuse to buy me: He said I was too small; so the merchant took me home with him again.</p>
            <p>The partner, whom I have spoken of as my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, was very angry to see me return, and again pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed putting an end to my life; for he represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the other, that I should bring them into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and difficulties, and that I was so little that no person would buy me.</p>
            <p>The merchant's resolution began to waver, and I was indeed afraid that I should be put to death: But however he said he would try me once more.</p>
            <p>A few days after a <hi>Dutch</hi> ship came into the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and they carried me on board, in hopes that the Captain would purchase me.—As they went, I heard them agree, that, if they could not sell me <hi>then,</hi> they would throw me overboard.—I was in extreme
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013311_0015_0F90F1FB63A3C780"/>
agonies when I heard this; and as soon as ever I saw the <hi>Dutch</hi> Captain, I ran to him, and put my arms round him, and said, "Father save me." (for I knew that if he did not buy me, I should be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ill, or, possibly murdered) And though he did not understand my language, yet it pleased the Almighty to influence him in my behalf, and he bought me <hi>for two yards of check,</hi> which is of more value <hi>there,</hi> than in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I left my dear mother I had a large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of gold about me, as is the custom of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, it was made into rings, and they were linked into one another, and formed into a kind of chain, and so put round my neck, and arms and legs, and a large piece hanging at one ear almost in the shape of a pear. I found all this troublesome, and was glad when my new master took it from me.—I was now washed, &amp; clothed in the <hi>Dutch</hi> or <hi>English</hi> manner.—My ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster grew very fond of me, and I loved him exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. I watched every look, was always ready when he wanted me, and endeavoured to convince him, by every action, that my only pleasure was to serve him well.—I have since thought that he must have been a serious man. His actions corresponded very well with such a character.—He used to read prayers in public to the ship's crew every sabbath day; and when first I saw him read, I was never so surprised in my whole life as when I saw the book talk to my master; for I thought it did, as I observed him to look upon it, and move his lips.—I wished it would do so to me.—As soon as my master had done read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I follow'd him to the place where he put the book, being mightily delighted with it, and when
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013311_0016_0F90F1FC096B9730"/>
nobody saw me, I open'd it and put my ear down close upon it, in great hope that it would say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to me; but was very sorry and greatly disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed when I found it would not speak, this thought immediately presented itself to me, that every body and every thing despised me because I was black.</p>
            <p>I was exceedingly sea-sick at first; but when I became more accustom'd to the sea, it wore off.—My master's ship was bound for <hi>Barbados.</hi> When we came there, he thought fit to speak of me to several gentlemen of his acquaintance, and one of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest a particular desire to see me.—He had a great mind to buy me; but the Captain could not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be prevail'd on to part with me; but howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the gentleman seemed very solicitous, he at length let me go, and I was sold for fifty dollars <hi>(four and six penny pieces in English.)</hi> My new master's name was <hi>Vanhorn,</hi> a young gentleman; his home was in <hi>New-England,</hi> in the city of <hi>New-York</hi>; to which place he took me with him. He dress'd me in his livery, &amp; was very good to me. My chief business was to wait at table, and tea, &amp; clean knives, &amp; I had a very easy place; but the servants used to curse &amp; swear surprizingly; which I learnt faster than any thing, 'twas almost the first English I could speak. If any of them affronted me, I was sure to call upon God to damn them immediately; but I was broke of it all at once, occasioned by the correction of an old black servant that lived in the family.—One day I had just clean'd the knives for dinner, when one of the maids took one to cut bread and butter with; I was very angry with her, and called upon God to damn her; when this old black man told me I must
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013311_0017_0F8FFB6575E27AB8"/>
not say so: I ask'd him why? He replied there was a wicked man, call'd the Devil, that liv'd in hell, and would take all that said these words and put them in the fire and burn them.—This terrified me greatly, and I was entirely broke of swearing. Soon after this, as I was placing the china for tea, my mistress came into the room just as the maid had been cleaning it; the girl had unfortunately sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the wainscot with the mop; at which my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress was angry; the girl very foolishly answered her again, which made her worse, and she called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God to damn her.—I was vastly concern'd to hear this, as she was a fine young lady, and very good to me, insomuch that I could not help speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her: Madam, says I, you must not say so: Why, says she? Because there is a black man, call'd the Devil, that lives in hell, and he will put you in the fire and burn you, and I shall be very sorry for that. Who told you this, replied my lady? Old Ned, says I. Very well was all her answer; but she told my master of it, who ordered that old Ned should be tied up and whipp'd, and was never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to come into the kitchen, with the rest of the servants, afterwards.—My mistress was not angry with me, but rather diverted at my simplicity, and, by way of talk, she repeated what I had said to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of her acquaintance that visited her; among the rest, <hi>Freelandhouse,</hi> a very gracious, good minister, heard it, and he took a great deal of notice of me, and desired my master to part with me to him. He would not hear of it at first, but, being greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, he let me go; and Mr. <hi>Freelandhouse</hi> gave £. 50 for me.—He took me home with him, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013311_0018_0F90F1FCBB114EB0"/>
made me kneel down, and put my two hands toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and prayed for me, and every night and morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he did the same.—I could not make out what it was for, nor the meaning of it, nor what they spoke to when they talked—I thought it comical, but I lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it very well.—After I had been a little while with my new master I grew more familiar, and asked him the meaning of prayer: (I could hardly speak <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> to be understood) he took great pains with me, and made me understand that he pray'd to God, who liv'd in Heaven; that he was my father and <hi>best</hi> friend.—I told him that this must be a mistake; that <hi>my</hi> father lived at <hi>Bournou,</hi> and I wanted very much to see him, and likewise my dear mother, and sister, and I wished he would be so good as to send me home to them; and I added, all I could think of to induce him to convey me back, I appeared in great trouble, and my good master was so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected that the tears run down his face. He told me that God was a great and good Spirit, that he created all the world, and every person and thing in it, <hi>Ethiopia, Africa</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> and every where I was delighted when I heard this: There, says I, I always thought so when I lived at home! Now, if I had wings like an eagle, I would fly to tell my dear mother that God is greater than the sun, moon and stars; and that they were made by him.</p>
            <p>I was exceedingly pleas'd with this information of my master's, because it corresponded so well with my own opinion; I thought now if I could but get home, I should be wiser than all my country-folks, my grandfather, or father, or mother, or any of them.—But though I was somewhat enlightened,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013311_0019_0F90F1FD72B95230"/>
by this information of my master's, yet I had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge of God than that he was a good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and created every body, and every thing.—I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was sensible, in myself, nor had any one ever told me, that he would punish the wicked, and love the just. I was only glad that I had been told there was a God, because I had always thought so.</p>
            <p>My dear kind master grew very fond of me, as was his lady; she put me to school, but I was uneasy at that, and did not like to go; but my master and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress requested me to learn in the gentlest terms, and persuaded me to attend my school without any anger at all; that, at last, I came to like it better, and learnt to read pretty well. My schoolmaster was a good man, his name was <hi>Vanosdore,</hi> and very indulgent to me.—I was in this state when, one Sunday, I heard my master preach from these words out of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> chap. i.v.7. "<hi>Behold, He cometh in the clouds and every eye shall see him and they that pierc'd Him.</hi>" These words affected me excessively; I was in great agonies because I thought my master directed them to me only; and, I fancied, that he observed me with unusual earnestness—I was farther confirm'd in this belief as I looked round the church, and could see no one person beside myself in such grief and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress as I was; I began to think that my master ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me, and was very desirous to go home, to my own country; for I thought that if God did come (as he said) He would be sure to be most angry with <hi>me,</hi> as I did not know what He was, nor had ever heard of him before.</p>
            <p>I went home in great trouble, but said nothing to any body.—I was somewhat afraid of my master;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013311_0020_0F90F1FE407877D8"/>
I thought he disliked me.—The next text I heard him preach from was, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii.14. "<hi>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the LORD.</hi>" He preached the law so severely, that it made me tremble.—He said, that GOD would judge the whole world; <hi>Ethiopia, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and every where.—I was now excessively perplexed, and undetermined what to do; as I had now reason to believe that my situation would be equally bad to go as to stay.—I kept these thoughts to myself, and said nothing to any person whatever.</p>
            <p>I should have complained to my good mistress of this great trouble of mind, but she had been a little strange to me for several days before this happened, occasioned by a story told of me by one of the maids. The servants were all jealous, and envied me the regard, and favour shewn me by my master and mistress; and the Devil being always ready, and diligent in wickedness, had influenced this girl to make a lie on me.—This happened about hay har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, and one day, when I was unloading the wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon to put the hay into the barn, she watched an opportunity, in my absence, to take the fork out of the stick, and hide it: When I came again to my work, and could not find it, I was a good deal vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but I concluded it was dropt somewhere among the hay; so I went and bought another with my own money: When the girl saw that I had another, she was so malicious that she told my mistress I was very unfaithful, and not the person she took me for; and that she knew, I had, without my master's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, ordered many things in his name, that he must pay for; and as a proof of my carelessness
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013311_0021_0F90F1FF049F3A40"/>
produced the fork she had taken out of the stick, and said, she had found it out of door:—My Lady, not knowing the truth of these things, was a little shy to me, till she mentioned it, and then I soon cleared myself, and convinced her that these accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were false.</p>
            <p>I continued in a most unhappy state for many days. My good mistress insisted on knowing what was the matter. When I made known my situation, she gave me John Bunyan on the holy war, to read; I found his experience similar to my own, which gave me reason to suppose he must be a bad man; as I was convinced of my own corrupt nature, and the misery of my own heart: And as he acknowledged that he was likewise in the same condition, I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced no relief at all in reading his work, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reverse.—I took the book to my lady, and informed her I did not like it at all, it was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wicked man as bad as myself; and I did not chuse to read it, and I desired her to give me ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wrote by a better man, that was holy, and without sin.—She assured me that John Bunyan was a good man, but she could not convince me; I thought him to be too much like myself to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, as his experience seemed to answer with my own.</p>
            <p>I am very sensible that nothing but the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and unspeakable mercies of the Lord could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve my soul from the heavy burden it laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at that time.—A few days after my master gave me Baxter's <hi>call to the unconverted.</hi> This was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to me neither; on the contrary it occasioned as much distress in me as the other had before done, <hi>as it</hi> invited all to come to <hi>Christ</hi>; and I found myself
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013311_0022_0F90F1FFC085DD88"/>
so wicked and miserable that I could not come— This consideration threw me into agonies that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be described; insomuch that I even attempted to put an end to my life—I took one of the large case-knives, and went into the stable with an intent to destroy myself; and as I endeavoured with all my strength to force the knife into my side, it bent double. I was instantly struck with horror at the thought of my own rashness, and my conscience told me that had I succeeded in this attempt I should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have gone to hell.</p>
            <p>I could find no relief, nor the least shadow of comfort; the extreme distress of my mind so affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my health that I continued very ill for three days, and nights; and would admit of no means to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for my recovery, though my lady was very kind, and sent many things to me; but I rejected every means of relief and wished to die—I would not go into my own bed, but lay in the stable upon straw— I felt all the horrors of a troubled conscience, so hard to be born, and saw all the vengeance of God ready to overtake me—I was sensible that there was no way for me to be saved unless I came to <hi>Christ,</hi> and I could not come to Him: I thought that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible He should receive such a sinner as me.</p>
            <p>The last night that I continued in this place, in the midst of my distress these words were brought home upon my mind, "<hi>Behold the Lamb of God,</hi>" I was something comforted at this, and began to grow easier and wished for day that I might find these words in my bible—I rose very early the following morning, and went to my school-master, Mr. Vanos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, and communicated the situation of my mind
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013311_0023_0F90F2008668D2C8"/>
to him; he was greatly rejoiced to find me inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way to Zion, and blessed the Lord who had worked so wonderfully for me a poor heathen.—I was more familiar with this good gentleman than with my master, or any other person; and found my self more at liberty to talk to him: He encouraged me greatly, and prayed with me frequently, and I was always benefited by his discourse.</p>
            <p>About a quarter of a mile from my master's house stood a large, remarkably fine oak-tree, in the midst of a wood; I often used to be employed there in cutting down trees, (a work I was very fond of) I seldom failed going to this place every day; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times twice a day if I could be spared. It was the highest pleasure I ever experienced to sit under this oak; for there I used to pour out all my complaints to the LORD: And when I had any particular grievance I used to go there, and talk to the tree, and tell my sorrows, as if it had been to a friend.</p>
            <p>Here I often lamented my own wicked heart, and undone state; and found more comfort and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation than I ever was sensible of before.—Whenever I was treated with ridicule or contempt, I used to come here and find peace. I now began to relish the book my master gave me, Baxter's <hi>call to the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,</hi> and took great delight in it. I was always glad to be employed in cutting wood, 'twas a great part of my business, and I followed it with delight, as I was then quite alone and my heart lifted up to GOD, and I was enabled to pray continually; and blessed for ever be his holy name, he faithfully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered my prayers. I can never be thankful enough to Almighty GOD for the many comfortable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities I experienced there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:013311_0024_0F90F2014373DD88"/>It is possible the circumstance I am going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late will not gain credit with many; but this I know, that the joy and comfort it conveyed to me, cannot be expressed, and only conceived by those who have experienced the like.</p>
            <p>I was one day in a most delightful frame of mind; my heart so overflowed with love and gratitude to the author of all my comforts:—I was so drawn out of myself, and so fill'd and awed by the presence of God, that I saw (or thought I saw) light inexpressible dart down from heaven upon me, and shone around me for the space of a minute.—I continued on my knees, and joy unspeakable took possession of my soul.—The peace and serenity which filled my mind after this was wonderful, and cannot be told.—I would not have changed situations, or been any one but myself for the whole world. I blest God for my poverty, that I had no worldly riches or grandeur to draw my heart from him. I wished at that time, if it had been possible for me, to have continued on that spot forever. I felt an unwillingness in myself to have any thing more to do with the world, or to mix with society again. I seemed to possess a full assurance that my sins were forgiven me. I went home all my way rejoicing, and this text of scripture came full upon my mind. "<hi>And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me.</hi>" The first opportunity that presented itself, I went to my old schoolmaster, and made known to him the happy state of my soul who joined with me in praise to God for his mercy to me the vilest of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013311_0025_0F90F201FA19F660"/>
—I was now perfectly easy and had hardly a wish to make beyond what I possessed, when my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral comforts were all blasted by the death of my dear and worthy master Mr. <hi>Freelandhouse,</hi> who was taken from this world rather suddenly: He had but a short illness, and died of a fever. I held his hand in mine when he departed; he told me he had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me my freedom. I was at liberty to go where I would.—He added that he had always prayed for me and hoped I should be kept unto the end. My master left me by his will ten pounds, and my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>I found that if he had lived twas his intention to take me with him to Holland, as he had often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned me to some friends of his there that were desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to see me; but I chose to continue with my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress who was as good to me as if she had been my mother.</p>
            <p>The loss of Mr. <hi>Freelandhouse</hi> distressed me great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but I was rendered still more unhappy by the cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perplexed situation of my mind; the great enemy of my soul being ready to torment me, would present my own misery to me in such striking light, and distress me with doubts, fears, and such a deep sense of my own unworthiness, that after all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and encouragement I had received, I was often tempted to believe I should be a cast-away at last.— The more I saw of the beauty and glory of God, the more I was humbled under a sense of my own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. I often repaired to my old place of prayer; I seldom came away without consolation. One day this scripture was wonderfully apply'd to my mind, <hi>And ye are complete in him which is the head of all
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013311_0026_0F90F202B44E6180"/>
principalities and power</hi>—The Lord was pleased to comfort me by the application of many gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises at times when I was ready to sink under my troubles. <hi>Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them,</hi> Heb. x.xiv. <hi>For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My kind, indulgent mistress liv'd but two years after my master. Her death was a great affliction to me. She left five sons, all gracious young men, and ministers of the gospel.—I continued with them all, one after another, till they died; they lived but four years after their parents. When it pleased God to take them to himself. I was left quite destitute, without a friend in the world. But I, who had so often experienced the goodness of God, trusted in him to do what he pleased with me.—In this help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less condition I went in the wood to prayer as usual; and though the snow was a considerable height, I was not sensible of cold, or any other inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.—At times, indeed, when I saw the world frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round me, I was tempted to think that the LORD had forsaken me. I found great relief from the contemplation of these words in Isai. xlix.16. <hi>Behold I have graven thee on the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.</hi> And very many comfortable promises were sweetly applied to me. The 89th Psal. and 34th ver. <hi>My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</hi> Heb. xvi.17, 18. Phil. i.6. and several more.</p>
            <p>As I had now lost all my dear and valued friends, every place in the world was alike to me. I had
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013311_0027_0F90F20375513B20"/>
for a great while entertained a desire to come to <hi>England.</hi>—I imagined that all the inhabitants of this island were <hi>holy</hi>; because all those that had visited my master from thence were good (Mr. Whitefield was his particular friend) and the authors of the books that had been given me were all English.— But, above all places in the world, I wish'd to see Kidderminster, for I could not but think that on the spot where Mr. Baxter had lived, and preach'd, the people must be all <hi>righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The situation of my affairs required that I should tarry a little longer in <hi>New York,</hi> as I was something in debt, and was embarrassed how to pay it. About this time a young gentleman that was a particular acquaintance of my young master's, pretended to be a friend to me, and promis'd to pay my debts, which was three pounds; and he assured me he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect the money again.—But, in less than a month, he came and demanded it; and when I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured him I had nothing to pay, he threatened to sell me.—Though I knew he had no right to do that, yet, as I had no friend in the world to go to, it alarm'd me greatly.—At length he purpos'd my going a privateering, that I might, by these means, be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to pay him, to which I agreed.—Our Captain's name was —. I went in character of cook to him.—Near St. <hi>Domingo</hi> we came up to five French ships, merchantmen.—We had a very smart engagement, that continued from eight in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till three in the afternoon; when victory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared on our side.—Soon after this we were met by three English ships which join'd us, and that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged us to attack a fleet of 36 ships.—We
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013311_0028_0F90F2044465E678"/>
boarded the three first, and then followed the others, and had the same success with twelve; but the rest escaped us.—There was a great deal of blood shed, and I was near death several times, but the LORD preserv'd me.</p>
            <p>I met with many enemies, and much persecution, among the sailors; one of them was particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to me, and studied ways to vex and teaze me. I can't help mentioning one circumstance that hurt me more than all the rest, which was, that he snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a book out of my hand, that I was very fond of, and used frequently to amuse myself with, &amp; threw it into the sea.—But, what is remarkable, he was the first that was killed in our engagement.—I don't pretend to say that this happened because he was not my friend; but I thought 'twas a very awful providence, to see how the enemies of the LORD are cut off.</p>
            <p>Our Captain was a cruel, hard-hearted man. I was excessively sorry for the prisoners we took in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: But the pitiable case of one young gentleman grieved me to the heart.—He appeared very amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; was strikingly handsome.—Our Captain took four thousand pounds from him; but that did not satisfy him, as he imagined he was possessed of more, and had somewhere concealed it, so that the Captain threatened him with death, at which he appeared in the deepest distress, and took the buckles out of his shoes, and untied his hair, which was very fine, and long; and in which several very valuable rings were fastened. He came into the cabin to me, and in the most obliging terms imaginable asked for something to eat and drink; which when I gave him he was
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013311_0029_0F90F204F09C88C8"/>
so thankful and pretty in his manner that my heart bled for him; and I heartily wished that I could have spoken in any language in which the ship's crew would not have understood me; that I might have let him know his danger; for I heard the Captain say he was resolved upon his death; and he put his barbarous design into execution, for he took him on shore with one of the sailors, and there they shot him.</p>
            <p>This circumstance affected me exceedingly. I could not put him out of my mind a long while.— When we returned to <hi>New York</hi> the Captain divided the prize-money among us, that we had taken. When I was called upon to receive my part, I waited upon Mr. —, (the gentleman that paid my debt and was the occasion of my going abroad) to know if he chose to go with me to receive my money, or if I should bring him what I owed.—He chose to go with me; and when the Captain laid my money on the table ('twas an hundred and thirty-five pounds) I desired Mr. — to take what I was indebted to him; and he swept it all into his handkerchief, and would never be prevailed on to give a farthing of money, nor any thing at all beside.—And he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise secured a hogshead of sugar which was my due from the same ship. The Captain was very angry with him for this piece of cruelty to me, as was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other person that heard it.—But I have reason to believe (as he was one of the principal merchants in the city) that he transacted business for him and on that account did not chuse to quarrel with him.</p>
            <p>At this time a very worthy gentleman, a wine merchant, his name <hi>Dunscum,</hi> took me under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013311_0030_0F90F205B39ADC78"/>
and would have recovered my money for me if I had chose it; but I told him to let it alone; that I would rather be quiet.—I believed that it would not prosper with him, and so it happened, for by a series of losses and misfortunes he became poor, and was soon after drowned, as he was on a party of pleasure.—The vessel was driven out to sea, and struck against a rock by which means every soul pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished.</p>
            <p>I was very much distressed when I heard it, and felt greatly for his family who were reduced to very low circumstances.—I never knew how to set a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per value on money, if I had but a little meat and drink to supply the present necessaries of life, I never wished for more; and when I had any I always gave it if ever I saw an object in distress. If it was not for my dear wife and children I should pay as little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to money now as I did at any time.—I continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some time with Mr. <hi>Dunscum</hi> as his servant; he was very kind to me.—But I had a vast inclination to visit <hi>England</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wished continually that it would please providence to make a clear way for me to see this island. I entertained a notion that if I could get to <hi>England</hi> I should never more experience either cruelty or ingratitude, so that I was very desirous to get among Christians. I knew Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> very well.—I had heard him preach often at <hi>New-York.</hi> In this disposition I listed in the twenty-eight regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of foot, who were designed for <hi>Martinico</hi> in the late war.—We went in Admiral Pocock's fleet from <hi>New York</hi> to <hi>Barbados</hi>; from thence to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinico.</hi>—When that was taken we proceeded to the <hi>Havanna,</hi> and took that place likewise.—There I got discharged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:013311_0031_0F90EC9730B2A8D8"/>I was then worth about thirty pounds, but I never regarded money in the least, nor would I tarry to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my prize-money lest I should lose my chance of going to <hi>England.</hi>—I went with the <hi>Spanish</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to <hi>Spain</hi>; and came to <hi>Old England</hi> with the English prisoners.—I cannot describe my joy when we were within sight of <hi>Portsmouth.</hi> But I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished when we landed to hear the inhabitants of that place curse and swear, and otherwise profane. I expected to find nothing but goodness, gentleness and meekness in this Christian land, I then suffered great perplexities of mind.</p>
            <p>I inquired if any serious Christian people resided there, the woman I made this inquiry of, answered me in the affirmative; and added that she was one of them.—I was heartily glad to hear her say so. I thought I could give her my whole heart: She kept a public house. I deposited with her all the money that I had not an immediate occasion for; as I thought it would be safer with her.—It was 25 guineas, but 6 of them I desired her to lay out to the best advantage, to buy me some shirts, hat, and some other necessaries. I made her a present of a very handsome large looking-glass, that I brought with me from Martinico, in order to recompence her for the trouble I had given her. I must do this woman the justice to acknowledge that she did lay out some little for my use, but the 19 guineas, and part of the 6, with my watch, she would not return, and denied that I ever gave it her.</p>
            <p>I soon perceived that I was got among bad people, who defrauded me of my money and watch; and that all my promis'd happiness was blasted, I had
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013311_0032_0F90F2067895C378"/>
no friend but GOD, and I prayed to him earnestly. I could scarcely believe it possible that the place where so many eminent Christians had lived and preached could abound with so much wickedness and deceit. I thought it worse than <hi>Sodom</hi> (consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the great advantages they have) I cry'd like a child, and that almost continually: At length GOD heard my prayers and raised me a friend indeed.</p>
            <p>This publican had a brother who lived on <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> common, his wife was a serious good woman. When she heard of the treatment I had met with, she came and inquired into my real situation, and was greatly troubled at the ill usage I had received, and took me home to her own house.—I began now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and my prayer was turned into praise. She made use of all the arguments in her power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on her who had wronged me, to return my watch and money, but it was to no purpose, as she had given me no receipt, and I had nothing to show for it, I could not demand it.—My good friend was excessively angry with her, and obliged her to give me back four guineas, which she said she gave me out of charity: Though in fact it was my own, and much more. She would have employed some rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er means to oblige her to give up my money, but I would not suffer her, let it go, says I, "My GOD is in heaven." Still I did not mind my loss in the least; all that grieved me was, that I had been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in finding some Christian friends, with whom I hoped to enjoy a little sweet and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble society.</p>
            <p>I thought the best method that I could take now, was to go to <hi>London,</hi> and find out Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:013311_0033_0F90F20733CDB800"/>
who was the only living soul I knew in <hi>England,</hi> and get him to direct me to some way or other to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a living without being troublesome to any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.—I took leave of my Christian friend at <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> and went in the stage to <hi>London.</hi>—A credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tradesman in the city, who went up with me in the stage, offered to show me the way to Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s tabernacle. Knowing that I was a perfect stranger, I thought it very kind, and accepted his offer; but he obliged me to give him half-a-crown for going with me, and likewise insisted on my giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him five shillings more for conducting me to Dr. <hi>Gifford</hi>'s meeting.</p>
            <p>I began now to entertain a very different idea of the inhabitants of <hi>England</hi> than what I had figured to myself before I came among them.—Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> received me very friendly, was heartily glad to see me, and directed me to a proper place to board and lodge in Petticoat-lane, till he could think of some way to settle me in, and paid for my lodging, and all my expences. The morning after I came to my new lodging, as I was at breakfast with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman of the house, I heard the noise of some looms over our heads: I inquired what it was; she told me a person was weaving silk.—I expressed a great desire to see it, and asked if I might: She told me she would go up with me: She was sure I should be very welcome. She was as good as her word, and as soon as we entered the room, the person that was weaving looked about, and smiled upon us, and I loved her from that moment. She asked me many questions, and I in turn talked a great deal to her. I found she was a member of Mr. <hi>Allen</hi>'s meeting, and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013311_0034_0F90F20800A9F7B8"/>
I began to entertain a good opinion of her, though I was almost afraid to indulge this inclination, least she should prove like all the rest I had met with at <hi>Ports<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. and which had almost given me a dislike to all white women.—But after a short acquaintance I had the happiness to find she was very different, and quite sincere, and I was not without hope that she entertained some esteem for me. We often went together to hear Dr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> and as I had always a propensity to relieve every object in distress as far as I was able, I used to give to all that complained to me; sometimes half a guinea at a time, as I did not understand the real value of it.—This gracious, good woman took great pains to correct and advise me in that and many other respects.</p>
            <p>After I had been in <hi>London</hi> about six weeks I was recommended to the notice of some of my late mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr. <hi>Freelandhouse</hi>'s acquaintance, who had heard him speak frequently of me. I was much persuaded by them to go to <hi>Holland.</hi> My master lived there before he bought me, and used to speak of me so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectfully among his friends there, that it raised in them a curiosity to see me; particularly the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men engaged in the ministry, who expressed a desire to hear my experience and examine me. I found that it was my good old master's design that I should have gone if he had lived; for which reason I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon going to <hi>Holland,</hi> and informed my dear friend Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> of my intention; he was much averse to my going at first, but after I gave him my reasons appeared very well satisfied. I likewise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed my <hi>Bet<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> (the good woman that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above) of my determination to go to <hi>Holland,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:013311_0035_0F90F208B18AF3F0"/>
and I told her that I believed she was to be my wife: That if it was the LORD's will I desired it, but not else.—She made me very little answer, but has since told me, she did not think it at that time.</p>
            <p>I embarked at tower-wharf at four o'clock in the morning, and arrived at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> the next day by three o'clock in the afternoon. I had several letters of recommendation to my old master's friends, who received me very graciously. Indeed, one of the chief ministers was particularly good to me, he kept me at his house a long while, and took great pleasure in asking questions, which I answered with delight, being always ready to say,
<q>Come unto me all ye that fear GOD, and I will tell what he hath done for my soul.</q>
I cannot but admire the footsteps of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>; astonished that I should be so wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served! Though the grandson of a King, I have wanted bread, and should have been glad of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est crust I ever saw. I who, at home, was surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and guarded by slaves, so that no indifferent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son might approach me, and clothed with gold, have been inhumanly threatened with death; and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanted clothing to defend me from the inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the weather; yet I never murmured, nor was I discontented.—I am willing, and even desirous, to be counted as nothing, a stranger in the world, and a pilgrim here; for "<hi>I know that my</hi> REDEEMER <hi>liveth,</hi>" and I'm thankful for every trial and trouble that I've met with, as I am not without hope that they have been all sanctified to me.</p>
            <p>The Calvinist ministers desired to hear my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience from myself, which proposal I was very well pleased with: So I stood before 48 ministers every
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013311_0036_0F90F2097A7BD128"/>
Thursday for seven weeks together, and they were all very well satisfied, and persuaded I was what I pretended to be.—They wrote down my experience as I spoke it; and the Lord almighty was with me at that time in a remarkable manner, and gave me words, and enabled me to answer them; so great was his mercy to take me in hand a poor blind Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
            <p>At this time a very rich merchant at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> offered to take me into his family, in the capacity of his butler, and I very willingly accepted it.—He was a gracious, worthy gentleman, and very good to me.—He treated me more like a friend than a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.—I tarried there a twelvemonth, but was not thoroughly contented, I wanted to see my wife (that is now) and for that reason I wished to return to <hi>England.</hi> I wrote to her once in my absence, but she did not answer my letter; and I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge if she had, it would have given me a less opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of her.—My master and mistress persuaded me not to leave them, and likewise their two sons, who entertained a good opinion of me; and if I had found my Betty married, on my arrival in <hi>England,</hi> I should have returned to them again immediately.</p>
            <p>My lady proposed my marrying her maid; she was an agreeable young woman, had saved a good deal of money, but I could not fancy her, though she was willing to accept of me, but I told her my inclinations were engaged in <hi>England,</hi> and I could think of no other person.—On my return home I found my Betty disengaged.—She had refused seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral offers in my absence, and told her sister that she thought if ever she married I was to be her husband.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:013311_0037_0F90F20A57D5F590"/>Soon after I came home I waited on Dr. Gifford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who took me into his family, and was exceedingly good to me. The character of this pious, worthy gentleman is well known; my praise can be of no use or signification at all.—I hope I shall ever grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully remember the many favours I have received from him. Soon after I came to Dr. Gifford, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed a desire to be admitted into their church, and set down with them; they told me I must first be baptized; so I gave in my experience before the church, with which they were very well satisfied, and I was baptized by Dr. Gifford, with some others. I then made known my intentions of being married; but I found there were many objections against it, because the person I had fixed on was poor. She was a widow, her husband had left her in debt, and with a child, so that they persuaded me against it out of real regard to me. But I had promised, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to have her; as I knew her to be a gracious woman, her poverty was no objection to me, as they had nothing else to say against her. When my friends found that they could not alter my opinion, respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, they wrote to Mr. Allen, the minister she attended, to persuade her to leave me; but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that he would not interfere at all, that we might do as we would. I was resolved that all my wife's little debts should be paid before we were married; so that I sold almost every thing I had, and with all the money I could raise, cleared all that she owed; and I never did any thing with a better will in all my life, because I firmly believed that we should be very happy together, and so it proved, for she was given me from the Lord. And I have found her a
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013311_0038_0F90F20B0EFBC8F0"/>
blessed partner, and we have never repented, though we have gone through many great troubles and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties.</p>
            <p>My wife got a very good living by weaving, and could do extremely well; but just at that time there was great disturbance among the weavers, so that I was afraid to let my wife work, least they should insist on my joining the rioters, which I could not think of, and, possibly, if I had refused to do so they would have knock'd me on the head. So that by these means my wife could get no employ, neither had I work enough to maintain my family. We had not yet been married a year before all these misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes overtook us.</p>
            <p>Just at this time a gentleman, that seemed much concerned for us, advised me to go into <hi>Essex</hi> with him, and promised to get me employed. I accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his kind proposal, and he spoke to a friend of his, a Quaker, a gentleman of large fortune, who resided a little way out of the town of <hi>Colchester,</hi> his name was <hi>Handbarrar,</hi> he ordered his steward to set me to work.</p>
            <p>There were several employed in the same way with myself. I was very thankful and contented though my wages were but small. I was allowed but eight pence a day, and found myself; but after I had been in this situation for a fortnight, my master, being told that a Black was at work for him, had an inclination to see me. He was pleased to talk to me for some time, and at last inquired what wages I had; when I told him, he declared it was too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and immediately ordered his steward to let me have eighteen pence a day, which he constantly gave me after; and I then did extremely well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:013311_0039_0F90F20BC172B270"/>I did not bring my wife with me: I came first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and it was my design, if things answered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our wishes, to send for her. I was now thinking to desire her to come to me, when I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter to inform me she was just brought to bed, and in want of many necessaries. This news was a great trial to me, and a fresh affliction: But my God, <hi>faithful and abundant in mercy,</hi> forsook me not in this trouble. As I could not read English, I was obliged to apply to some one to read the letter I received, relative to my wife. I was directed by the good providence of God to a worthy young gentleman, a Quaker, and friend of my master.—I desired he would take the trouble to read my letter for me, which he readily complied with, and was greatly moved and affected at the contents; insomuch that he said he would undertake to make a gathering for me, which he did and was the first to contribute to it himself. The money was sent that evening to London, by a person who happened to be going there; nor was this all the goodness that I experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced from these kind friends, for as soon as my wife came about and was fit to travel, they sent for her to me, and were at the whole expence of her coming; so evidently has the love and mercy of God appeared through every trouble that ever I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced.</p>
            <p>We went on very cordially all the summer. We lived in a little cottage near Mr. <hi>Handbarrar</hi>'s house; but when the winter came on I was discharged, as he had no further occasion for me. And now the prospect began to darken upon us again. We tho't it most adviseable to move our habitation a little
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013311_0040_0F90F20C79869FA0"/>
nearer to the town, as the house we lived in was very cold and wet, and ready to tumble down.</p>
            <p>The boundless goodness of God to me has been so very great, that, with the most humble gratitude, I desire to prostrate myself before him; for I have been wonderfully supported in every affliction.— My God never left me. I perceived light <hi>still,</hi> thro' the thickest darkness.</p>
            <p>My dear wife and I were now both unemployed, we could get nothing to do. The winter proved remarkably severe, and we were reduced to the greatest distress imaginable.—I was always very shy of asking for any thing; I could never beg; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did I chuse to make known our wants to any person, for fear of offending, as we were entire stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; but our last bit of bread was gone, and I was obliged to think of something to do for our support. I did not mind for myself at all; but to see my dear wife and children in want, pierc'd me to the heart.—I now blam'd myself for bringing her from London, as doubtless had we continued there we might have found friends to keep us from starving. The snow was remarkably deep; so that we could see no prospect of being relieved. In this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy situation, not knowing what step to pursue, I resolved to make my case known to a gentleman's gardiner that lived near us, and entreat him to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy me; but when I came to him my courage fail'd me, and I was ashamed to make known our real si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.—I endeavoured all I could to prevail on him to set me to work, but to no purpose; he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured me it was not in his power: But just as I was about to leave him, he asked me if I would accept of

some carrots? I took them with great thankfulness, and carried them home; he gave me four, they were very large and fine.—We had nothing to make fire with, so consequently could not boil them; but was glad to have them to eat raw. Our youngest child was quite an infant; so that my wife was obliged to chew it, and fed her in that manner for several days. We allowed ourselves but one every day, lest they should not last till we could get some other supply. I was unwilling to eat at all myself; nor would I take any the last day that we continued in this situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as I could not bear the thought that my dear wife and children would be in want of every means of support. We lived in this manner till our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rots were all gone: Then my wife began to lament because of our poor babes; but I comforted her all I could; still hoping, and believing, that my God would not let us die; but that it would please him to relieve us, which he did by almost a miracle.</p>
            <p>We went to bed, as usual, before it was quite dark (as we had neither fire nor candle) but had not been there long before some person knocked at the door, and inquired if <hi>James Albert</hi> lived there? I answer'd in the affirmative, and rose immediately; as soon as I opened the door I found it was the servant of an eminent attorney who resided at <hi>Colchester.</hi> He ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me how it was with me? If I was not almost starved? I burst out a crying, and told him I was indeed. He said his master suppos'd so, and that he wanted to speak with me, and I must return with him. This gentleman's name was <hi>Daniel,</hi> he was a sincere, good Christian. He used to stand and talk with me frequently, when I work'd in the road for
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013311_0042_0F90F20DF3DF0998"/>
Mr. <hi>Handbarrar,</hi> and would have employed me him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self if I had wanted work.—When I came to his house he told me that he had thought a good deal about me of late, and was apprehensive that I must be in want, and could not be satisfied till he sent to inquire after me. I made known my distress to him, at which he was greatly affected; and generously gave me a guinea; and promised to be kind to me in future. I could not help exclaiming, <hi>O the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less mercies of my God!</hi> I prayed unto him, and he has heard me; I trusted in him, and he has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd me: Where shall I begin to praise him? Or how shall I love him enough?</p>
            <p>I went immediately and bought some bread and cheese and coal and carried them home. My dear wife was rejoiced to see me return with something to eat. She instantly got up and dressed our babies, while I made a fire; and the first nobility in the land never made a more comfortable meal. We did not forget to thank the Lord for all his goodness to us. Soon after this, as the spring came on, Mr. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Daniel</hi> employed me in pulling down a house, and rebuilding it. I had then very good work, and full employ: He sent for my wife and children to <hi>Colchester,</hi> and provided us a house, where we lived very comfortably. I hope I shall always gratefully acknowledge his kindness to myself and family. I worked at this house for more than a year, till it was finished; and after that I was employed by several successively, and was never so happy as when I had something to do; but perceiving the winter coming on, and work rather slack, I was apprehensive that we should again be in want, or become troublesome to our friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:013311_0043_0F90F20EB5F6AAB0"/>I had at this time an offer made me of going to <hi>Norwich,</hi> and having constant employ. My wife seemed pleased with this proposal, as she supposed she might get work there in the weaving manufacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being the business which she was brought up to, &amp; more likely to succeed there than any other place; and we thought as we had an opportunity of moving to a town where we could both be employed, it was most adviseable to do so; and that probably we might settle there for our lives. When this step was resolved on, I went first alone to see how it would answer; which I very much repented after, for it was not in my power immediately to send my wife any supply, as I fell into the hands of a master that was neither kind nor considerate; and she was reduced to great distress, so that she was obliged to sell the few goods that we had, and when I sent for her was under the disagreeable necessity of parting with our bed.</p>
            <p>When she came to <hi>Norwich</hi> I hired a room ready furnished.—I experienced a great deal of difference in the carriage of my master from what I had been accustomed to from some of my other masters. He was very irregular in his payments to me.—My wife hired a loom and wove all the leisure time she had and we began to do very well, till we were overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by fresh misfortunes. Our three poor children fell ill of the small pox; this was a great trial to us; but still I was persuaded in myself we should not be forsaken.—And I did all in my power to keep my dear partner's spirits from sinking. Her whole at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention now was taken up with the children, as she could mind nothing else, and all I could get was but
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013311_0044_0F90F20F8239EA70"/>
little to support a family in such a situation, beside paying for the hire of our room, which I was obliged to omit doing for several weeks: But the woman to whom we were indebted would not excuse us, though I promised she should have the very first money we could get after my children came about, but she would not be satisfied, and had the cruelty to threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us that if we did not pay her immediately, she would turn us all into the street.</p>
            <p>The apprehension of this plunged me in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est distress, considering the situation of my poor ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies: If they had been in health I should have been less sensible of this misfortune. But my God, <hi>still faithful to his promise,</hi> raised me a friend. Mr. <hi>Henry Gurdney,</hi> a Quaker, a gracious gentleman heard of our distress, he sent a servant of his own to the woman we hired the room of, paid our rent, and bought all the goods, with my wife's loom, and gave it us all.</p>
            <p>Some other gentlemen, hearing of his design, were pleased to assist him in these generous acts, for which we never can be thankful enough; after this my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren soon came about; we began to do pretty well again; my dear wife worked hard and constant when she could get work, but it was upon a disagreeable footing, as her employ was so uncertain, sometimes she could get nothing to do, and at other times when the weavers of <hi>Norwich</hi> had orders from <hi>London,</hi> they were so excessively hurried, that the people they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed were often obliged to work on the Sabbath-day: But this my wife would never do, and it was matter of uneasiness to us that we could not get our living in a regular manner, though we were both diligent, industrious, and willing to work. I was far
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013311_0045_0F9050102371D658"/>
from being happy in my master, he did not use me well. I could scarcely ever get my money from him; but I continued patient till it pleased GOD to alter my situation.</p>
            <p>My worthy friend Mr. <hi>Gurdney</hi> advised me to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the employ of chopping chaff, and bought me an instrument for that purpose. There were but few people in the town that made this their business beside myself; so that I did very well indeed and we became easy and happy.—But we did not continue long in this comfortable state. Many of the inferior people were envious and ill-natur'd, and set up the same employ, and worked under price on purpose to get my business from me, and they succeeded so well that I could hardly get any thing to do, and became again unfortunate: Nor did this misfortune come alone, for just at this time we lost one of our little girls, who died of a fever; this circumstance occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned us new troubles, for the Baptist minister refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to bury her because we were not their members. The parson of the parish denied us because she had never been baptized. I applied to the Quakers, but met with no success; this was one of the greatest trials I ever met with, as we did not know what to do with our poor baby —At length I resolved to dig a grave in the garden behind the house, and bury her there; when the parson of the parish sent for me to tell me he would bury the child, but did not chuse to read the burial service over her. I told him I did not mind whether he would or not, as the child could not hear it.</p>
            <p>We met with a great deal of ill treatment after this, and found it very difficult to live.—We could
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013311_0046_0F90F21033611768"/>
scarcely get work to do, and were obliged to pawn our clothes. We were ready to sink under our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.—When I proposed to my wife to go to <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> and try if we could do there. I had always an inclination for that place, and now more than ever, as I had heard Mr. <hi>Fawcet</hi> mentioned in the most respectful manner, as a pious worthy gentleman, and I had seen his name in a favourite book of mine, Baxter's <hi>saints everlasting rest</hi>; and as the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of <hi>Kidderminster</hi> seemed to promise my wife some employment, she readily came into my way of thinking.</p>
            <p>I left her once more, and set out for <hi>Kidderminster</hi> in order to judge if the situation would suit us.—As soon as I came there I waited immediately on Mr. <hi>Fawcet,</hi> who was pleased to receive me very kindly and recommended me to Mr. <hi>Watson,</hi> who employed me in twisting silk and worsted together. I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued here about a fortnight, and when I thought it would answer our expectation, I returned to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi> to fetch my wife; she was then near her time, and too much indisposed. So we were obliged to tarry until she was brought to bed, and as soon as she could conveniently travel we came to <hi>Kidderminster,</hi> but we brought nothing with us, as we were obliged to sell all we had to pay our debts, and the expences of my wife's illness, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Such is our situation at present.—My wife, by hard labor at the loom, does every thing that can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from her towards the maintenance of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and God is pleased to incline the hearts of his people at times to yield us their charitable assistance; being my self through age and infirmity able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute

but little to their support. As pilgrims, and very poor pilgrims we are traveling through many difficulties towards our heavenly home, and waiting patiently for his glorious call, when the Lord shall deliver us out of the evils of this present world, and bring us to the everlasting glories of the world to come.—To HIM be praise for ever and ever. AMEN.</p>
