            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>MATTHEW, xxiv.—45, 46, 47, ver.</bibl>
                  <q>Who then is a faithful and wiſe ſervant, whom his Lord hath made ruler over his houſehold, to give them meat in due ſeaſon? bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing: Verily I ſay unto you he ſhall make him ruler over all his goods.</q>

               </opener>
               <p>AMONG the many metaphors uſed in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſcripture, expreſſive of the duty and ſubjection we owe to God our Father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that of a ſervant is perhaps the moſt frequent. It is uſed with the higheſt propriety; for it is juſt in its ſelf, and adapted to convey ideas of the higheſt importance to us. For he who made us, he who provides for us, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting both ſoul and body in all their noble powers and organs, has ſurely an unlimitted right to our ſervices. He, who has redeemed us unto God with his own moſt precious blood, that we might be to him <hi>a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</hi> has the higheſt claims upon us, and may juſtly expect we ſhould glorify him in our bodies &amp; in our ſouls which are the Lords. In a word, he may juſtly expect, that, in our reſpective ſtations and characters, we ſhould yield all ready obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:019705_0005_0FAC9B9363C26758"/>
and ſubjection to him, who has laid down his precious life for us.</p>
               <p>AND indeed, my friends, the true ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt glory in their character: they eſteem it their higheſt dignity, that they are now no longer ſervants and ſlaves, to the prince of the power of this world; nor to their own vile luſts: but that the bleſſed ſon of God hath made them free: though other Lords have had dominion over them, yet henceforth they will make mention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his name.</p>
               <p>SERVANTS muſt do their maſters work, and keep ever in view, as their rule and guide his commands and will: they muſt do their work with cheerfulneſs,—with ſingleneſs of heart,—and good fidelity; though their maſter may appoint to ſome more work, to others leſs, according to their ſeveral abilities; yet all have ſomething on their hands by his appointment of importance to be done. Nor does the ſubordination of labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or that of their work, at all prevent their holding one common title, under their great Lord: they are all his ſervants, and bleſſed be his name, if they are faithful, however they may rank among themſelves, they ſhall <hi>all</hi> in the laſt day,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:019705_0006_0FAC9B9421562248"/>
receive a moſt gracious reward from their divine maſter, in the preſence of attending angels, and an aſſembled world.</p>
               <p>THE ſervant mentioned in the text, ſeems to have been one greatly honored with peculiar ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents and entruſtments; he is made ruler over his maſters houſehold, his character and poſt are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable, with ſome ſpecial propriety, to <hi>Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates</hi> and <hi>Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MAGISTRATES are appointed, by the wiſe and good providence of heaven, to rule among men, in ſubordination to, and in immitation of him, "who himſelf rules the world in righteouſneſs, and judges the people with equity." The holy Apoſtle Paul accordingly roundly aſſerts, <hi>that the powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> They are, in this ſenſe even under the preſent diſpenſation, <hi>the Lord's annointed,</hi> appointed by him miniſters of God for good. They have in their exalted ſtations, the ſolemn oath and charge of God impoſed upon them, to regard ſupremely his honor, to promote the great end of their delegated power, and the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good.</hi> They are commanded to be <hi>juſt,</hi> to <hi>fear God,</hi> to <hi>hate coveteouſneſs,</hi> and ever to bear in mind that <hi>God is with them in the judgment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:019705_0007_0FAC9B94E654CE20"/>
THESE are his honored ſervants in the <hi>State,</hi>—the earthly political houſehold of the Lord: they are appointed to do his work, to promote the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> which is the great end of all political government;—<hi>to give to every one his meat in due ſeaſon,</hi> and advance, to their utmoſt, the great deſigns of God's moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world: Happy are theſe his honored ſervants, <hi>whom when their Lord cometh, he ſhall find ſo doing: Verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall make them rulers over all his goods;</hi> their ſtations ſhall be marked with diſtinguiſhed honor in the world of ſupreme glory.</p>
               <p>MINISTERS muſt conſider themſelves under the character of <hi>ſervants</hi> in the church of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God: their work is ſpiritual, their charge is great, and their account will be moſt ſolemn. By the great <hi>head</hi> of the church they are made ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in his ſpiritual houſehold, <hi>which is the church of the living God;</hi> they are appointed to this office, not to <hi>Lord it over mens faith,</hi> or conſciences; but to be <hi>helpers of their joy;</hi> and to <hi>give to every one his portion of meat in due ſeaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GREAT wiſdom and faithfulneſs are neceſſary in miniſters, in order to their acquiting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:019705_0008_0FAC9B95A1EE0900"/>
to God and their own conſciences: though as miniſters of that kingdom of their bleſſed Lord, which is not of this world, they are not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with matters of government, nor aſſume <hi>lordly titles</hi> over their fellow ſubjects; yet it muſt be allowed, they have a moſt important depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum committed to them; they have an arduous work on their hands; they have been <hi>charged in the preſence of God and the holy angels, to watch for ſouls as thoſe who muſt give account;</hi> they are urged to be found faithful in the houſehold of God, by innumerable motives of the higheſt moment; one only might be thought ſufficient; they are the <hi>ſervants</hi> of mens <hi>ſouls</hi> for <hi>Chriſt's ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT, my reſpected hearers, while we have pointed out magiſtrates and miniſters as eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned in the ſacred paſſage, we are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let none of this aſſembly conſider themſelves as wholly diſintereſted in the ſubject in hand; for perſons of every age, rank and character have ſomething intruſted them by the great Lord of the houſehold; they have ſome talents to improve for the well-being of the State to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; the honor of Chriſt and the edification of the church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:019705_0009_0FAC9B9661B72250"/>
WE have all the proper work of <hi>time</hi> aſſigned us, in whatever poſts we are placed. There is ſomething to be done, for ourſelves and ſociety.—Something in our power to effect, either by our heads, our hearts, or our hands. We muſt all <hi>be diligent in buſineſs, and fervent in ſpirit, ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord.</hi> I ſay again, time, and all its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant concernments, are talents intruſted us by the great <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>all;</hi>—and wo unto us, if by indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or attention to other things, things compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively of no importance, we <hi>wrap theſe talents up in a napkin,</hi> and leave them unimproved.</p>
               <p>BUT give me leave to conſider, a little more diſtinctly, the character of wiſe and faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as it is conciſely drawn by our Lord in the text.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be ſuppoſed then, that they <hi>know</hi> the <hi>duties</hi> of their particular ſtations; and what <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi> are intruſted them for their improvement.</p>
               <p>ONE, who is wholly ignorant of his Lord's will; who either cannot, or will not underſtand the duties, of his particular ſtation; or in what way he ought to ſerve God and man, cannot be numbered among, either the wiſe, or the faithful
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:019705_0010_0FAC9B97216E3270"/>
ſervants. The good ſervants, therefore of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, will not fail to enquire with diligence, after their maſter's will; and carefully conſider what are the duties, which eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to that department, he has aſſigned them: Their language, from time to time, will be, like that of Saul, in his way to Demaſcus, <hi>Lord, what wouldſt thou have me to do?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE ſervant in the text, is called a <hi>wiſe</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, not only becauſe it is our higheſt wiſdom to be faithful; but becauſe he was <hi>prudent,</hi> being well inſtructed in all the duties of his ſtation.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, wiſe ſervants, will keep in their proper ſpheres.</p>
               <p>THEY will not intermeddle with things which lie out of their line, or above their capacity. <hi>Wherein God hath called them, therein they will abide with God.</hi> They will diligently attend upon the buſineſs of their own proper ſtations; they will conſider what are the talents intruſted them; and be concerned to improve thoſe they <hi>have,</hi> not thoſe they <hi>have not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE want of this kind of wiſdom, has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, both into the church and ſtate, great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.

Hence have proceeded thoſe violent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, on that order of prieſthood, which God himſelf, eſtabliſhed in the Jewiſh oeconomy: Hence the ſtory of <hi>Korah, Dathan, and Abiram;</hi> as you will ſee at large in <hi>Num.</hi> XVI, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Hence alſo that unhappy king <hi>Uzziah,</hi> who thurſt himſelf into the prieſt's office, and was ſtruck, by the hand of the Lord, with the plague of leproſy, for his prophane preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: You will read the account of this memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble event in 2d <hi>Chron.</hi> XXVI. <hi>chap.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOR has the chriſtian church been free from the ſad effects of the ſame ſpirit. Many have <hi>run before they were ſent:</hi> and thoſe <hi>who kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>w not what are the firſt principles of the oracles of God,</hi> have imagined they were quite equal to the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous undertaking;—that they could <hi>ſtop the mouth of gainſayers,</hi> and <hi>rightly divide the word of truth, giving to every one, his portion in due ſeaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the State has been as much infeſted, with this proud and ſelf-advancing ſpirit, as the church. While modeſty, with great abilities, has been contented in her humble ſtation; though in the truth of facts, one of the higheſt recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to public truſt; the ſelf-confident aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of ſome ignorant, overbearing perſons, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

by the braſs in their face, or the gold in their purſe, have puſhed themſelves into places, which they could neither fill with dignity, nor reſign without humiliating regret. Hence, the wiſe king <hi>Solomon,</hi> long ſince obſerved a <hi>ſore evil under the ſun, namely, ſervants on horſe-back, and princes walking by their ſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAIN, faithful ſervants, are ſuppoſed to be well acquainted, with the <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>purpoſes,</hi> to which their talents and entruſtments, muſt be applied. The glory of the great Lord of all, and the happineſs of mankind, command their higheſt attention. They know that God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, when the great purpoſes of his moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are anſwered; theſe centre in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of mankind. For "the Father of Being is the Father of mercies, a principle of boundleſs active love; and though infinitely various in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, his deſign is one, his own glory, or which is evidently the ſame thing, the happineſs of his creatures, is the centre in which all the lines of his government unite. Every thing takes place in the univerſal ſyſtem, according as it tends to the accompliſhment of this great parental pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe." The duties, therefore of the ſecond table, or what we owe to our fellow ſervants, will be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019705_0013_0FAC9B9961D82770"/>
eyed with great attention. The religion of our Divine Maſter, is moſt kind and beneficent: The goſpel itſelf is a manifeſtation of divine love, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to it's proper object,—the ſalvation of a ruined world. Every attentive perſon, muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it is well adapted to promote, civil and ſocial happineſs: For, it inriches the heart with every virtue, which tends to adorn human nature, and to increaſe the common ſtock of ſocial hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. "It forms the wiſe and prudent parent,—the amiable child,—the affectionate brother,—the generous friend; but above all, the judicious, upright and conſiſtent magiſtrate; who riſes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, not only to views of perſonal intereſt; but what is often more expreſſive of true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the prejudice of party, and the blind impulſe of paſſion; who with the knowledge and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own heart, is unmoved by the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward humours of the world around him; and whether they frown or flatter, he remains fixed in his purpoſe, of promoting their happineſs."—Thus faithful ſervants, influenced by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our holy religion, will ardently deſire, and aſſiduouſly endeavor to promote the well-being of all around them; eſpecially of thoſe who are committed to <hi>their</hi> care in their character of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates or miniſters. The ſervant in the text,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019705_0014_0FAC9B9A229F6358"/>
gave the houſhold, their meat in due ſeaſon: It was his <hi>fidelity in this branch of his character,</hi> his Lord emphaſiſed, and remarked with ſo much kind reſpect.</p>
               <p>BE aſſured, my reſpected friends, faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are not only acquainted with the duties of their reſpective ſtations; and know the ends which ſhould command their higheſt attention; but they are conſtantly and conſcienciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to diſcharge theſe duties, and to anſwer the end of their appointment, to ſuch particular ſtations, in the oeconomy of God's moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>ARE they rulers? They will <hi>rule in the fear of God;</hi> devoting themſelves to his honor, <hi>by whom kings reign, and princes decree juſtice:</hi> they will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in ſome happy meaſure, though alas! infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhort of the great original, the wiſdom,—the juſtice,—faithfulneſs and mercy of the Supreme Ruler, all which glorious perfections ſhine with reſplendent luſtre, in his moral government of the world.</p>
               <p>ARE they miniſters of the goſpel? it is their great concern to <hi>obtain mercy of the Lord to be found faithful.</hi> They give themſelves wholly to their proper work; <hi>warning every man—and teaching

every man in all wiſdom that they may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ARE they parents or maſters? they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly concerned <hi>to walk in their houſes with a perfect heart.</hi> They behave with kindneſs, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, and fidelity towards thoſe committed to their care and government:—They endeavor to teach them by precepts, and their own examples, the true fear of the Lord. Conſider them in any,—in all the dear ſocial connexions of life, you will ſee them <hi>kind and courteous, tender hearted and pitiful;</hi> endeavouring to exhibit themſelves a patern to others, in the full exerciſe, of all the ſocial virtues and graces of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>To ſum up all in few words; they, who are wiſe and faithful ſervants, employ all their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and improve all their opportunities, in their reſpective ſtations, for the glory of God, and the welfare of mankind. Their time,—their health,—their dignities,—their ſubſtance,—the gifts and graces of the goſpel,—and all their advantages, of either doing good to others; or of obtaining eſſential benefit to themſelves: all theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated and devoted, to the honor of their great

Maſter, by a careful, and faithful improvement of them.</p>
               <p>BUT it is more than time, my worthy hearers, that the ſubject ſhould be particularly addreſſed to the honorable Court, whoſe preſence has call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to ſpeak, from this ſacred place.

For, Heaven forbid, that this State, in her infancy, ſhould ſo far forget her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, that grand palladium of all her liberties, as to ſuffer infidels and deiſts to faſten their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con hands on the reins of government; or give a place, in their legiſlative, judicial, or executive body to any one, who does not hold himſelf ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable at the tribunal of him <hi>who has a name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten on his veſture and on his thigh, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>

                  <hi>Honored Gentlemen,</hi> YOUR dignity,—your duty,—and the moſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:019705_0017_0FAC9B9C613914C8"/>
powerful motives to fidelity have been imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinted in the didactic part of our ſubject. It is preſumed you have liſtened with an attentive ear, to a ſubject, in which your public characters ſo deeply intereſt you. You have, I truſt, alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made the application of the practical part to your own hearts.</p>
               <p>YOU are called, by the ſuffrage of free citizens, to be <hi>rulers over God's houſhold:</hi> And thus for the voice of the people may, undoubtedly, be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as <hi>the voice of God.</hi> Yea, the great maſter of the houſhold himſelf ſtiles you Gods. <hi>I ſaid ye are Gods; but ye ſhall die like men.</hi> Your ſtations are honorable, as they are important: And while you faithfully diſcharge the duties, belonging to your ſeveral departments, you have juſt claims of <hi>hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and obedience</hi> on us,—on this whole common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>IF, according to your original deſignation, you are indeed <hi>the miniſters of God for good;</hi> if you are wiſe and faithful, always <hi>ſeeking the peace of God's people;</hi> if you give to the houſhold their meat in due ſeaſon, by a <hi>juſt and wiſe legiſlation,</hi> and by a <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>energetic execution</hi> of good laws; then duty, love and gratitude oblige us, to pay you
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:019705_0018_0FAC9B9D212CDFC8"/>
high honor and reſpect. Yea, it is in the code of goſpel precepts, enjoined us, not only to <hi>fear God,</hi> but to <hi>honor ſuch civil rulers,</hi> we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>to ſubmit ourſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake;</hi> and we ought, by the ſame divine authority, to <hi>render cuſtom, (or tribute,) to whom cuſtom, fear to whom fear, and honor to whom honor is due.</hi> Every citizen therefore, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the protection of the laws, ſo far from caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any reproach on your character; or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening your hands, by calumniating inſinuations, will ſhow you every mark of dutiful reſpect; &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtrengthen your hands, in the diſcharge of the duties of your public character.</p>
               <p>YOUR duty, and your dignity go hand in hand: They are eſſentially connected together. The rule and meaſure is plainly drawn,—drawn by your <hi>own</hi> hands, in the <hi>conſtitution</hi> of this State, from which you have ſolemnly <hi>ſworn</hi> you will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate. <hi>This</hi> you will therefore, carefully ſtudy in all its branches. You will conſider it of great importance, to know, theſe ſtatutes and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that you might not tranſgreſs: You will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that, for this end, the princes of God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people, were divinely enjoined, to write out, with their own hands, the Moſaic conſtitution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:019705_0019_0FAC9B9DE140E8B0"/>
GIVE me leave, to remind you, that it is the <hi>conſtitution,</hi> and <hi>conſtitutional laws,</hi> to which the people have pledged their fidelity and obedience; and not to any body of men, however otherwiſe reſpectable. The moment therefore, you ſhould preſume to raiſe yourſelves, in political importance, above the conſtitution, you would forfeit your political dignity; and ſtand upon the ſame ground, with the loweſt voters in the ſtate. Did I ſay, upon the ſame ground? I correct myſelf: For ſuch voters are ſuppoſed to be free, from every charge, of public infidelity: But you would be liable to be called upon, to anſwer for your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs, at the tribunal of an injured people.</p>
               <p>DETERMINED to make this your main guide; you will exert your combined efforts, fully to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, that public confidence your fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, have repoſed in you. And ſurely, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to recollect, that the wiſe and faithful ſervant, whom his Lord made ruler over all his houſhold, gave them their meat in due ſeaſon: This was the principal part of his duty! this he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharged. When you conſider therefore, yourſelves appointed by the ſame Lord, through the voice of the people, to be rulers over this part of his houſhold; and that the very end of this
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:019705_0020_0FAC9B9EA16E51B0"/>
appointment, is, that you might have it in your power, to give every member his portion of meat in due ſeaſon;—this conſideration, will ſurely annihilate every low motive;—every ſpecies of party ſpirit, and ſelfiſh views: For theſe would be likely to draw off your attention, from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic emolument, and fix it on your own families, or near connexions. You will reprobate, with the higheſt indignation, the idea of deſecrating the important <hi>depoſitum</hi> committed to you, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy purpoſes, of feeding <hi>yourſelves</hi> only, and not the whole houſhold.</p>
               <p>THUS united, and in earneſt to promote the public welfare of every part of this State, you will immediately find important buſineſs crowding from every quarter, on your heads,—your hearts, your hands: For, the preſent ſuffering circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the houſhold, call aloud for your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate care.</p>
               <p>BUT modeſt propriety, and a full conviction of my own inability, to lead you through the laberinth of public labors, forbid my making any attempt of the kind.</p>
               <p>ONLY, let me obſerve, the ſcarcity of a circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019705_0021_0FAC9B9F615B4A98"/>
medium;—the low State of our national credit, and commerce;—the poor multiplying in all our towns;—inattention to the natural ſources of our wealth;—<abbr>viz.</abbr> agriculture; manufactures: well regulated commerce; and eſpecially that oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical prudence, which is eſſential to the public proſperity of every people; theſe are ſubjects, which call aloud for the united wiſdom and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy of this honorable court.</p>
               <p>A reviſion of ſuch acts, as have been ſuppoſed, inconſiſtent with the conſtitution:—The appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of proper perſons, to repreſent you in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, perſons, poſſeſſed of talents adapted to ſerve in that very important ſtation, and adorned with ſuch a chriſtian character, as you would wiſh to have exhibited, as a ſample of your own chriſtian morality, before other chriſtian nations;—toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the appointment to other offices in the State as there may be a call for them;—as alſo means to reward ſuch as are faithful, without diſtreſſing the people;—theſe undoubtedly are objects, worthy the notice and careful attention, of this reſpected court.</p>
               <p>THE ſcarcity of men of literary abilities, and the importance in which the riſing generation,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:019705_0022_0FAC9BA050093598"/>
are juſtly held, by all the wiſe in every nation, eſpecially in infant Sates, will ſurely turn your paternal eyes on our youth. You will wiſh to have their young minds, cultivated under the ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand of able and religious inſtructors;—ſuch as are capable, at leaſt, of teaching them the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of our own language; and inſtructing them, by their own examples, in the principles of chriſtian morality. If there are good laws al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enacted on this ſubject, it is preſumed you will endeavor to give more energy to ſuch, as have hitherto, utterly failed of anſwering their ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſign.</p>
               <p>IN a word, your watchful and compaſionate eyes will pervade every part of the houſhold: Your hearts will feel for <hi>all:</hi> And your hands of juſtice,—truth—and goodneſs will be employed for <hi>all.</hi> And bleſſed are ye, if when your great Lord calls you from your preſent diſtinguiſhed ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either by death, or in any other way, you ſhall be found ſo doing.</p>
               <p>HIS mouth ſhall bleſs you, who has all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of bleſſing in his hands: And whom he bleſſes, is bleſſed indeed. You ſhall have peace in your own conſciences: <hi>the peace of God, which paſſeth
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:019705_0023_0FAC9BA0E22AB440"/>
all underſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and minds, through Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Heavens bleſſings ſhall be implored upon you, by all the wiſe and good: You ſhall be bleſſed with more wiſdom and grace; and perhaps, with further intruſtments: For, to him who thus hath, thus faithfully improves what he hath, we may juſtly expect more ſhall be given: Your fellow citizens ſhall bleſs you: Yea, children yet unborn, ſhall have your names tranſmitted them, with high honor.</p>
               <p>BUT above all, your Lord and maſter in Heaven ſhall bleſs you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and pronounce, in the great day of his appearing, that happy <hi>euge</hi> on you: <hi>Well done, good and faithful ſervants, ye have been faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a few things, I will make you rulers over many things; enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude; let this whole aſſembly be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with a deep ſenſe, of the infinite importance of fidelity in their reſpective ranks. God's eye is ever fixt on us all: As there are none above his controul, ſo there are none below his notice: We ſhall all ſtand together, before the <hi>bar of Chriſt,</hi> there—ſolemn thought! there to render up our reſpective accounts, of the various talents intruſted us; and to be judged according to the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:019705_0024_0FAC9BA1A1A90508"/>
deeds done in the body. <hi>Then</hi> all theſe diſtinctions ſhall be laid aſide: <hi>Then</hi> there will be neither <hi>honorable</hi> nor <hi>baſe,</hi> in any other ſenſe, than as we ſhall in that important hour, be pronounced ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>faithful, or unfaithful, righteous</hi> or <hi>wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEN, all rule and authority, ſhall be put down: For Chriſt the great Meſſiah, <hi>ſhall reign, till all things are put under his feet.</hi> O, therefore, let us <hi>now</hi> kiſs the ſon, leſt he be angry with us, and we periſh in that day; <hi>bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him</hi>
