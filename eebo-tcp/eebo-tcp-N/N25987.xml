            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following account of the life of VENTURE, is a relation of ſimple facts, in which nothing is added in ſubſtance to what he related himſelf. Many other intereſting and curious paſſages of his life might have been inſerted; but on account of the bulk to which they muſt neceſſarily have ſwelled this narrative, they were omitted. If any ſhould ſuſpect the truth of what is here related, they are referred to people now living who are acquainted with moſt of the facts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the narrative.</p>
            <p>The reader is here preſented with an account, not of a renowned politician or warrior, but of an untu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored African ſlave, brought into this Chriſtian country at eight years of age, wholly deſtitute of all education but what he received in common with other domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated animals, enjoying no advantages that could lead him to ſuppoſe himſelf ſuperior to the beaſts, his fellow ſervants. And if he ſhall derive no other advantage from peruſing this narrative, he may experience thoſe ſenſations of ſhame and indignation, that will prove him to be not wholly deſtitute of every noble and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous feeling.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of the following pages, had he received only a common education, might have been a man of high reſpectability and uſefulneſs; and had his educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion been ſuited to his genius, he might have been an ornament and an honor to human nature. It may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, not be unpleaſing to ſee the efforts of a great mind wholly uncultivated, enfeebled and depreſſed by ſlavery, and ſtruggling under every diſadvantage.—
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034560_0003_0FFE298FE10C4038"/>
The reader may here ſee a Franklin and a Waſhington, in a ſtate of nature, or rather in a ſtate of ſlavery. Deſtitute as he is of all education, and broken by hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and infirmities of age, he ſtill exhibits ſtriking traces of native ingenuity and good ſenſe.</p>
            <p>This narrative exhibits a pattern of honeſty, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and induſtry, to people of his own colour, and perhaps ſome white people would not find themſelves degraded by imitating ſuch an example.</p>
            <p>The following account is publiſhed in compliance with the earneſt deſire of the ſubject of it, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a number of reſpectable perſons who are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I. Containing an account of his life, from his birth to the time of his leaving his native country.</head>
               <p>I WAS born at Dukandarra, in Guinea, about the year 1729. My father's name was Saungm Furro, Prince of the Tribe of Dukandarra. My father had three wives. Polygamy was not uncommon in that country, eſpecially among the rich, as every man was allowed to keep as many wives as he could maintain. By his firſt wife he had three children. The eldeſt of them was myſelf, named by my father, Broteer. The other two were named Cundazo and Soozaduka. My father had two children by his ſecond wife, and one by his third. I deſcended from a very large, tall and ſtout race of beings, much larger than the generality of people in other parts of the globe, being commonly conſiderable above ſix feet in height, and every way well proportioned.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing worthy of notice which I remember was, a contention between my father and mother, on account of my father's marrying his third wife without the conſent of his firſt and eldeſt, which was contrary to the cuſtom generally obſerved among my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. In conſequence of this rupture, my mother left her huſband and country, and travelled away with her three children to the eaſtward. I was then five years old. She took not the leaſt ſuſtenance along with her, to ſupport either herſelf or children. I was able to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034560_0005_0FFE29942E7BB050"/>
travel along by her ſide; the other two of her offspring ſhe carried one on her back, and the other being a ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing child, in her arms. When we became hungry, my mother uſed to ſet us down on the ground, and gather ſome of the fruits which grew ſpontaneouſly in that climate. Theſe ſerved us for food on the way. At night we all lay down together in the moſt ſecure place we could find, and repoſed ourſelves until morning. Though there were many noxious animals there; yet ſo kind was our Almighty protector, that none of them were ever permitted to hurt or moleſt us. Thus we went on our journey until the ſecond day after our departure from Dukandarra, when we came to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a great deſert. During our travel in that we were often affrighted with the doleful howlings and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of wolves, lions, and other animals. After five days travel we came to the end of this deſert, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately entered into a beautiful and extenſive inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val country. Here my mother was pleaſed to ſtop and ſeek a refuge for me. She left me at the houſe of a very rich farmer. I was then, as I ſhould judge, not leſs than one hundred and forty miles from my native place, ſeparated from all my relations and acquaintance. At this place my mother took her farewel of me, and ſet out for her own country. My new guardian, as I ſhall call the man with whom I was left, put me into the buſineſs of tending ſheep, immediately after I was left with him. The flock which I kept with the aſſiſtance of a boy, conſiſted of about forty. We drove them every morning between two and three miles to paſture, into the wide and delightful plains. When night drew on, we drove them home and ſecured them in the cote. In this round I continued during my ſtay there. One incident which befel me when I was driving my flock from paſture, was ſo dreadful to me in that age, and is to this time ſo freſh in my memory, that I cannot help noticing it in this place. Two large dogs ſallied out of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:034560_0006_0FFE296815B26D98"/>
a certain houſe and ſet upon me. One of them took me by the arm, and the other by the thigh, and before their maſter could come and relieve me, they lacerated my fleſh to ſuch a degree, that the ſcars are very viſible to the preſent day. My maſter was immediately ſent for. He came and carried me home, as I was unable to go myſelf on account of my wounds. Nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable happened afterwards until my father ſent for me to return home.</p>
               <p>Before I diſmiſs this country, I muſt juſt inform my reader what I remember concerning this place. A large river runs through this country in a weſterly courſe. The land for a great way on each ſide is flat and level, hedged in by a conſiderable riſe of the country at a great diſtance from it. It ſcarce ever rains there, yet the land is fertile; great dews fall in the night which refreſh the ſoil. About the latter end of June or firſt of July, the river begins to riſe, and gradually increaſes until it has inundated the country for a great diſtance, to the height of ſeven or eight feet. This brings on a ſlime which enriches the land ſurpriſingly. When the river has ſubſided, the natives begin to ſow and plant, and the vegetation is exceeding rapid. Near this rich river my guardian's land lay. He poſſeſſed, I cannot exactly tell how much, yet this I am certain of reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, that he owned an immenſe tract. He poſſeſſed likewiſe a great many cattle and goats. During my ſtay with him I was kindly uſed, and with as much tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for what I ſaw, as his only ſon, although I was an entire ſtranger to him, remote from friends and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The principal occupations of the inhabitants there, were the cultivation of the ſoil and the care of their flocks. They were a people pretty ſimilar in every reſpect to that of mine, except in their perſons, which were not ſo tall and ſtout. They appeared to be very kind and friendly. I will now return to my departure from that place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:034560_0007_0FFE2995B1739B60"/>My father ſent a man and horſe after me. After ſettling with my guardian for keeping me, he took me away and went for home. It was then about one year ſince my mother brought me here. Nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occured to us on our journey until we arrived ſafe home.</p>
               <p>I found then that the difference between my parents had been made up previous to their ſending for me. On my return, I was received both by my father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with great joy and affection, and was once more reſtored to my paternal dwelling in peace and happineſs. I was then about ſix years old.</p>
               <p>Not more than ſix weeks had paſſed after my return, before a meſſage was brought by an inhabitant of the place where I lived the preceding year to my father, that that place had been invaded by a numerous army, from a nation not far diſtant, furniſhed with muſical inſtruments, and all kinds of arms then in uſe; that they were inſtigated by ſome white nation who equipped and ſent them to ſubdue and poſſeſs the country; that his nation had made no preparation for war, having been for a long time in profound peace that they could not defend themſelves againſt ſuch a formidable train of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, and muſt therefore neceſſarily evacuate their lands to the fierce enemy, and fly to the protection of ſome chief; and that if he would permit them they ſhould come under his rule and protection when they had to retreat from their own poſſeſſions. He was a kind and merciful prince, and therefore conſented to theſe propoſals.</p>
               <p>He had ſcarcely returned to his nation with the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, before the whole of his people were obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from their country, and come to my father's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
               <p>He gave them every privilege and all the protection his government could afford. But they had not been there longer than four days before news came to them
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034560_0008_0FFE296997831AA0"/>
that the invaders had laid waſte their country, and were coming ſpeedily to deſtroy them in my father's territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. This affrighted them, and therefore they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately puſhed off to the ſouthward, into the unknown countries there, and were never more heard of.</p>
               <p>Two days after their retreat, the report turned out to be but too true. A detachment from the enemy came to my father and informed him, that the whole army was encamped not far out of his dominions, and would invade the territory and deprive his people of their liberties and rights, if he did not comply with the following terms, Theſe were to pay them a large ſum of money, three hundred fat cattle, and a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of goats, ſheep, aſſes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>My father told the meſſenger he would comply rather than that his ſubjects ſhould be deprived of their rights and privileges, which he was not then in circumſtances to defend from ſo ſudden an invaſion. Upon turning out thoſe articles, the enemy pledged their faith and honor that they would not attack him. On theſe he relied and therefore thought it unneceſſary to be on his guard againſt the enemy. But their pledges of faith and honor proved no better than thoſe of other unprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled hoſtile nations; for a few days after a certain relation of the king came and informed him, that the enemy who ſent terms of accommodation to him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived tribute to their ſatisfaction, yet meditated an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon his ſubjects by ſurpriſe, and that probably they would commence their attack in leſs than one day, and concluded with adviſing him, as he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for war, to order a ſpeedy retreat of his family and ſubjects. He complied with this advice.</p>
               <p>The ſame night which was fixed upon to retreat, my father and his family ſet off about break of day. The king and his two younger wives went in one company, and my mother and her children in another. We left our dwellings in ſucceſſion, and my father's company
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034560_0009_0FFE2997344F4028"/>
went on firſt. We directed our courſe for a large ſhrub plain, ſome diſtance off, where we intended to conceal ourſelves from the approaching enemy, until we could refreſh and reſt ourſelves a little. But we preſently found that our retreat was not ſecure. For having ſtruck up a little fire for the purpoſe of cooking victuals, the enemy who happened to be encamped a little diſtance off, had ſent out a ſcouting party who diſcovered us by the ſmoke of the fire, juſt as we were extinguiſhing it, and about to eat. As ſoon as we had finiſhed eating, my father diſcovered the party, and immediately began to diſcharge arrows at them. This was what I firſt ſaw, and it alarmed both me and the women, who being unable to make any reſiſtance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately betook ourſelves to the tall thick reeds not far off, and left the old king to fight alone. For ſome time I beheld him from the reeds defending himſelf with great courage and firmneſs, till at laſt he was obliged to ſurrender himſelf into their hands.</p>
               <p>They then came to us in the reeds, and the very firſt ſalute I had from them was a violent blow on the head with the fore part of a gun, and at the ſame time a graſp round the neck. I then had a rope put about my neck, as had all the women in the thicket with me, and were immediately led to my father, who was likewiſe pinion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and haltered for leading. In this condition we were all led to the camp. The women and myſelf being pretty ſubmiſſive, had tolerable treatment from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, while my father was cloſely interrogated reſpecting his money which they knew he muſt have. But as he gave them no account of it, he was inſtantly cut and pounded on his body with great inhumanity, that he might be induced by the torture he ſuffered to make the diſcovery. All this availed not in the leaſt to make him give up his money, but he deſpiſed all the tortures which they inflicted, until the continued exerciſe and increaſe of torment, obliged him to ſink and expire.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:034560_0010_0FFE296B1B9C4C60"/>
He thus died without informing his enemies of the place where his money lay. I ſaw him while he was thus tortured to death. The ſhocking ſcene is to this day freſh in my mind, and I have often been overcome while thinking on it. He was a man of remarkable ſtature. I ſhould judge as much as ſix feet and ſix or ſeven inches high, two feet acroſs his ſhoulders, and every way well proportioned. He was a man of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſtrength and reſolution, affable, kind and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ruling with equity and moderation.</p>
               <p>The army of the enemy was large, I ſhould ſuppoſe conſiſting or about ſix thouſand men. Their leader was called Baukurre. After deſtroying the old prince, they decamped and immediately marched towards the ſea, lying to the weſt, taking with them myſelf and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men priſoners. In the march a ſcouting party was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from the main army. To the leader of this party I was made waiter, having to carry his gun, &amp;c.— As we were a ſcouting we came acroſs a herd of fat cattle, conſiſting of about thirty in number. Theſe we ſet upon, and immediately wreſted from their keepers, and afterwards converted them into food for the army. The enemy had remarkable ſucceſs in deſtroying the country wherever they went. For as far as they had penetrated, they laid the habitations waſte and captur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people. The diſtance they had now brought me was about four hundred miles. All the march I had very hard taſks impoſed on me, which I muſt perform on pain of puniſhment. I was obliged to carry on my head a large flat ſtone uſed for grinding our corn, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I ſhould ſuppoſe, as much as 25 pounds; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides victuals, mat and cooking utenſils. Though I was pretty large and ſtout of my age, yet theſe burthens were very grievous to me, being only about ſix years and an half old.</p>
               <p>We were then come to a place called Malagaſco.— When we entered the place we could not ſee the leaſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:034560_0011_0FFE299A2278A178"/>
appearance of either houſes or inhabitants, but upon ſtricter ſearch found, that inſtead of houſes above ground they had dens in the ſides of hillocks, contiguous to ponds and ſtreams of water. In theſe we perceived they had all hid themſelves, as I ſuppoſe they uſually did up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch occaſions. In order to compel them to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the enemy contrived to ſmoke them out with fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots. Theſe they put to the entrance of the caves and ſet them on fire. While they were engaged in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, to their great ſurpriſe ſome of them were deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wounded with arrows which fell from above on them. This myſtery they ſoon found out. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that the enemy diſcharged theſe arrows through holes on the top of the dens directly into the air.— Their weight brought them back, point downwards on their enemies heads, whilſt they were ſmoking the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants out. The points of their arrows were poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, but their enemy had an antidote for it, which they inſtantly applied to the wounded part. The ſmoke at laſt obliged the people to give themſelves up. They came out of their caves, firſt ſpatting the palms of their hands together, and immediately after extended their arms, croſſed at their wriſts, ready to be bound and pinioned. I ſhould judge that the dens above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned were extended about eight feet horizontally into the earth, ſix feet in height and as many wide. They were arched over head and lined with earth, which was of the clay kind, and made the ſurface of their walls firm and ſmooth.</p>
               <p>The invaders then pinioned the priſoners of all ages and ſexes indiſcriminately, took their flocks and all their effects, and moved on their way towards the ſea. On the march the priſoners were treated with clemency, on account of their being ſubmiſſive and humble. Having come to the next tribe, the enemy laid ſiege and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took men, women, children, flocks, and all their valuable effects. They then went on to the next diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:034560_0012_0FFE296E06320B58"/>
which was contiguous to the ſea, called in Africa, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>. The enemies proviſions were then almoſt ſpent, as well as their ſtrength. The inhabitants know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what conduct they had purſued, and what were their preſent intentions, improved the favorable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, attacked them, and took enemy, priſoners, ſtocks and all their effects. I was then taken a ſecond time. All of us were then put into the caſtle, and kept for market. On a certain time I and other priſoners were put on board a canoe, under our maſter, and rowed away to a veſſel belonging to Rhode-Iſland, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by capt. Collingwood, and the mate Thomas Mumford. While we were going to the veſſel, our maſter told us all to appear to the beſt poſſible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for ſale. I was bought on board by one Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Mumford, ſteward of ſaid veſſel, for four gallons of rum, and a piece of calico, and called VENTURE, on account of his having purchaſed me with his own private venture. Thus I came by my name. All the ſlaves that were bought for that veſſel's cargo, were two hundred and ſixty.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II. Containing an account of his life, from the time of his leaving Africa, to that of his becoming free.</head>
               <p>AFTER all the buſineſs was ended on the coaſt of Africa, the ſhip ſailed from thence to Barbadoes. After an ordinary paſſage, except great mortality by the ſmall pox, which broke out on board, we arrived at the iſland of Barbadoes: but when we reached it, there were found out of the two hundred and ſixty that ſailed from Africa, not more than two hundred alive. Theſe were all ſold, except myſelf and three more, to the planters there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:034560_0013_0FFE299E842BB7F0"/>The veſſel then ſailed for Rhode-Iſland, and arrived there after a comfortable paſſage. Here my maſter ſent me to live with one of his ſiſters, until he could carry me to Fiſher's Iſland, the place of his reſidence. I had then completed my eighth year. After ſtaying with his ſiſter ſome time I was taken to any maſter's place to live.</p>
               <p>When we arrived at Narraganſet, my maſter went aſhore in order to return a part of the way by land, and gave me the charge of the keys of his trunks on board the veſſel, and charged me not to deliver them up to any body, not even to his father without his orders. To his directions I promiſed faithfully to conform. When I arrived with my maſter's articles at his houſe, my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's father aſked me for his ſon's keys, as he wanted to ſee what his trunks contained. I told him that my maſter intruſted me with the care of them until he ſhould return, and that I had given him my word to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the truſt, and could not therefore give him or any other perſon the keys without my maſter's directions. He inſiſted that I ſhould deliver to him the keys, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening to puniſh me if I did not. But I let him know that he ſhould not have them let him ſay what he would. He then laid aſide trying to get them. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he appeared to give up trying to obtain them from me, yet I miſtruſted that he would take ſome time when I was off my guard, either in the day time or at night to get them, therefore I ſlung them round my neck, and in the day time concealed them in my boſom, and at night I always lay with them under me, that no perſon might take them from me without being apprized of it. Thus I kept the keys from every body until my maſter came home. When he returned he aſked where VEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE was. As I was then within hearing, I came, and ſaid, here ſir, at your ſervice. He aſked me for his keys, and I immediately took them off my neck and reached them out to him. He took them, ſtroked my hair, and commended me, ſaying in preſence of his father that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:034560_0014_0FFE297252DBF8F0"/>
his young VENTURE was ſo faithful that he never would have been able to have taken the keys from him but by violence; that he ſhould not fear to truſt him with his whole fortune, for that he had been in his native place ſo habituated to keeping his word, that he would ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice even his life to maintain it.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the time of living at my maſter's own place, I was pretty much employed in the houſe at card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wool and other houſhold buſineſs. In this ſituation I continued for ſome years, after which my maſter put me to work out of doors. After many proofs of my faithfulneſs and honeſty, my maſter began to put great confidence in me. My behavior to him had as yet been ſubmiſſive and obedient. I then began to have hard taſks impoſed on me. Some of theſe were to pound four buſhels of ears of corn every night in a barrel for the poultry, or be rigorouſly puniſhed. At other ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year I had to card wool until a very late hour. Theſe taſks I had to perform when I was about nine years old. Some time after I had another difficulty and oppreſſion which was greater than any I had ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſince I came into this country. This was to ſerve two maſters. James Mumford, my maſter's ſon, when his father had gone from home in the morning and given me a ſtint to perform that day, would order me to do <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> buſineſs different from what my maſter directed me. One day in particular, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which my maſter's ſon had ſet up, had like to have produced melancholy effects. For my maſter having ſet me off my buſineſs to perform that day and then left me to perform it, his ſon came up to me in the courſe of the day, big with authority, and commanded me very arrogantly to quit my preſent buſineſs and go directly about what he ſhould order me. I replied to him that my maſter had given me ſo much to perform that day, and that I muſt therefore faithfully complete it in that time. He then broke out into a great rage, ſnatched
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034560_0015_0FFE29A169AB3C80"/>
a pitchfork and went to lay me over the head therewith; but I as ſoon got another and defended myſelf with it, or otherwiſe he might have murdered me in his outrage. He immediately called ſome people who were within hearing at work for him, and ordered them to take his hair rope and come and bind me with it. They all tried to bind me but in vain, tho' there were three aſſiſtants in number. My upſtart maſter then deſiſted, put his pocket handkerchief before his eyes and went home with a deſign to tell his mother of the ſtruggle with young VENTURE. He told her that their young VEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE had become ſo ſtubborn that he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul him, and aſked her what he ſhould do with him. In the mean time I recovered my temper, voluntarily cauſed myſelf to be bound by the ſame men who tried in vain before, and carried before my young maſter, that he might do what he pleaſed with me. He took me to a gallows made for the purpoſe of hanging cattle on, and ſuſpended me on it. Afterwards he ordered one of his hands to go to the peach orchard and cut him three dozen of whips to puniſh me with. Theſe were brought to him, and that was all that was done with them, as I was releaſed and went to work after hanging on the gallows about an hour.</p>
               <p>After I had lived with my maſter thirteen years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then about twenty two years old, I married Meg, a ſlave of his who was about my age. My maſter owned a certain Iriſhman, named Heddy, who about that time formed a plan of ſecretly leaving his maſter. After he had long had this plan in meditation he ſuggeſted it to me. At firſt I caſt a deaf ear to it, and rebuked Heddy for harboring in his mind ſuch a raſh undertaking. But after he had perſuaded and much enchanted me with the proſpect of gaining my freedom by ſuch a method, I at length agreed to accompany him. Heddy next inveigled two of his fellow ſervants to accompany us. The place to which we deſigned to go was the Miſſiſſippi. Our
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034560_0016_0FFE29754E99A7D8"/>
next buſineſs was to lay in a ſufficient ſtore of proviſions for our voyage. We privately collected out of our maſter's ſtore, ſix great old cheeſes, two firkins of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and one whole batch of new bread. When we had gathered all our own clothes and ſome more, we took them all about midnight, and went to the water ſide. We ſtole our maſter's boat, embarked, and then directed our courſe for the Miſſiſſippi river.</p>
               <p>We mutually confederated not to betray or deſert one another on pain of death. We firſt ſteered our courſe for Montauk point, the eaſt end of Long-Iſland. After our arrival there we landed, and Heddy and I made an incurſion into the iſland after freſh water, while our two comrades were left at a little diſtance from the boat, employed at cooking. When Heddy and I had ſought ſome time for water, he returned to our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and I continued on looking for my object. When Heddy had performed his buſineſs with our companions who were engaged in cooking, he went directly to the boat, ſtole all the clothes in it, and then travelled away for Eaſt-Hampton, as I was informed. I returned to my fellows not long after. They informed me that our clothes were ſtolen, but could not determine who was the thief, yet they ſuſpected Heddy as he was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. After reproving my two comrades for not taking care of our things which were in the boat, I advertiſed Heddy and ſent two men in ſearch of him. They purſued and overtook him at Southampton and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the boat. I then thought it might afford ſome chance for my freedom, or at leaſt a palliation for my running away, to return Heddy immediately to his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and inform him that I was induced to go away by Heddy's addreſs. Accordingly I ſet off with him and the reſt of my companions for our maſter's, and arrived there without any difficulty. I informed my maſter that Heddy was the ringleader of our revolt, and that he had uſed us ill. He immediately put Heddy into
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034560_0017_0FFE29A2EDE592A0"/>
cuſtody, and myſelf and companions were well received and went to work as uſual.</p>
               <p>Not a long time paſſed after that, before Heddy was ſent by my maſter to New-London gaol. At the cloſe of that year I was ſold to a Thomas Stanton, and had to be ſeparated from my wife and one daughter, who was about one month old. He reſided at Stonington<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. To this place I brought with me from my late maſter's, two johannes, three old Spaniſh dollars, and two thouſand of coppers, beſides five pounds of my wife's money. This money I got by cleaning gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's ſhoes and drawing boots, by catching muſk-rats and minks, raiſing potatoes and carrots, &amp;c. and by fiſhing in the night, and at odd ſpells.</p>
               <p>All this money amounting to near twenty-one pounds York currency, my maſter's brother, Robert Stanton, hired of me, for which he gave me his note. About one year and a half after that time, my maſter purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my wife and her child, for ſeven hundred pounds old tenor. One time my maſter ſent me two miles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a barrel of molaſſes, and ordered me to carry it on my ſhoulders. I made out to carry it all the way to my maſter's houſe. When I lived with Captain George Mumford, only to try my ſtrength, I took up on my knees a tierce of ſalt containing ſeven buſhels, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it two or three rods. Of this fact there are ſeveral eye witneſſes now living.</p>
               <p>Towards the cloſe of the time that I reſided with this maſter, I had a falling out with my miſtreſs. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened one time when my maſter was gone to Long-Iſland a gunning. At firſt the quarrel began between my wiſe and her miſtreſs. I was then at work in the barn, and hearing a racket in the houſe, induced me to run there and ſee what had broken out. When I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the houſe, I found my miſtreſs in a violent paſſion with my wife, for what ſhe informed me was a mere trifle; ſuch a ſmall affair that I forbear to put my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034560_0018_0FFE2976E2A9B3F8"/>
to the ſhame of having it known. I earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted my wife to beg pardon of her miſtreſs for the ſake of peace, even if ſhe had given no juſt occaſion for offence. But whilſt I was thus ſaying my miſtreſs turned the blows which ſhe was repeating on my wife to me. She took down her horſe-whip, and while ſhe was glutting her fury with it, I reached out my great black hand, raiſed it up and received the blows of the whip on it which were deſigned for my head. Then I immediately committed the whip to the devouring fire.</p>
               <p>When my maſter returned from the iſland, his wife told him of the affair, but for the preſent he ſeemed to take no notice of it, and mentioned not a word about it to me. Some days after his return, in the morning as I was putting on a log in the fire-place, not ſuſpecting harm from any one, I received a moſt violent ſtroke on the crown of my head with a club two feet long and as large round as a chair-poſt. This blow very badly wounded my head, and the ſcar of it remains to this day. The firſt blow made me have my wits about me you may ſuppoſe, for as ſoon as he went to renew it, I ſnatched the club out of his hands and dragged him out of the door. He then ſent for his brother to come and aſſiſt him, but I preſently left my maſter, took the club he wounded me with, carried it to a neighboring Juſtice of the Peace, and complained of my maſter. He final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſed me to return to my maſter, and live contented with him till he abuſed me again, and then complain. I conſented to do accordingly. But before I ſet out for my maſter's, up he come and his brother Robert after me. The Juſtice improved this convenient opportunity to caution my maſter. He aſked him for what he treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſlave thus haſtily and unjuſtly, and told him what would be the conſequence if he continued the ſame treatment towards me. After the Juſtice had ended his diſcourſe with my maſter, he and his brother ſet out with me for home, one before and the other behind me.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034560_0019_0FFE29A5D88F27B8"/>
When they had come to a bye place, they both diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted their reſpective horſes, and fell to beating me with great violence. I became enraged at this and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately turned them both under me, laid one of them acroſs the other, and ſtamped both with my feet what I would.</p>
               <p>This occaſioned my maſter's brother to adviſe him to put me off. A ſhort time after this I was taken by a conſtable and two men. They carried me to a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith's ſhop and had me hand-cuffed. When I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home my miſtreſs enquired much of her waiters, whether VENTURE was hand-cuffed. When ſhe was informed that I was, ſhe appeared to be very contented and was much tranſported with the news. In the midſt of this content and joy, I preſented myſelf before my miſtreſs, ſhewed her my hand-cuffs, and gave her thanks for my gold rings. For this my maſter commanded a negro of his to fetch him a large ox chain. This my maſter locked on my legs with two padlocks. I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to wear the chain peaceably for two or three days, when my maſter aſked me with contemptuous, hard names whether I had not better be freed from my chains and go to work. I anſwered him, No. Well then, ſaid me, I will ſend you to the Weſt-Indies or baniſh you, for I am reſolved not to keep you. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him I croſſed the waters to come here, and I am willing to croſs them to return.</p>
               <p>For a day or two after this not any one ſaid much to me, until one Hempſted Miner, of Stonington, aſked me if I would live with him. I anſwered him that I would. He then requeſted me to make myſelf diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and to appear as unreconciled to my maſter as I could before that he bargained with him for me; and that in return he would give me a good chance to gain my freedom when I came to live with him. I did as he requeſted me. Not long after Hempſted Miner purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me of my maſter for fifty-ſix pounds lawful. He
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:034560_0020_0FFE2978941ECD78"/>
took the chain and padlocks from off me immediately after.</p>
               <p>It may here be remembered, that I related a few pages back, that I hired out a ſum of money to Mr. Robert Stanton, and took his note for it. In the fray between my maſter Stanton and myſelf, he broke open my cheſt containing his brother's note to me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed it. Immediately after my preſent maſter bought me, he determined to ſell me at Hartford. As ſoon as I became apprized of it, I bethought myſelf that I would ſecure a certain ſum of money which lay by me, ſafer than to hire it out to a Stanton. Accordingly I buried it in the earth, a little diſtance from Thomas Stanton's, in the road over which he paſſed daily. A ſhort time after my maſter carried me to Hartford, and firſt propoſed to ſell me to one William Hooker of that place. Hooker aſked whether I would go to the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Flats with him. I anſwered, No. He ſaid I ſhould, if not by fair means I ſhould by foul. If you will go by no other meaſures, I will tie you down in my ſleigh. I replied to him, that if he carried me in that manner, no perſon would purchaſe me, for it would be thought that he had a murderer for ſale. After this he tried no more, and ſaid he would not have me as a gift.</p>
               <p>My maſter next offered me to Daniel Edwards, Eſq. of Hartford, for ſale. But not purchaſing me, my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pawned me to him for ten pounds, and returned to Stonington. After ſome trial of my honeſty, Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards placed conſiderable truſt and confidence in me. He put me to ſerve as his cup-bearer and waiter. When there was company at his houſe, he would ſend me into his cellar and other parts of his houſe to fetch wine and other articles occaſionally for them. When I had been with him ſome time, he aſked me why my maſter wiſhed to part with ſuch an honeſt negro, and why he did not keep me himſelf. I replied that I could not give him the reaſon, unleſs it was to convert me into caſh, and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:034560_0021_0FFE29A77814F6D0"/>
ſpeculate with me as with other commodities. I hope that he can never juſtly ſay it was on account of my ill conduct that he did not keep me himſelf. Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards told me that he ſhould be very willing to keep me himſelf, and that he would never let me go from him to live, if it was not unreaſonable and inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for me to be parted from my wife and children; therefore he would furniſh me with a horſe to return to Stonington, if I had a mind for it. As Miner did not appear to redeem me I went, and called at my old maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Stanton's firſt to ſee my wife, who was then owned by him. As my old maſter appeared much ruffled at my being there, I left my wife before I had ſpent any conſiderable time with her, and went to Colonel O. Smith's. Miner had not as yet wholly ſettled with Stanton for me, and had before my return from Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford given Col. Smith a bill of ſale of me. Theſe men once met to determine which of them ſhould hold me, and upon my expreſſing a deſire to be owned by Col. Smith, and upon my maſter's ſettling the remainder of the money which was due to Stanton for me, it was agreed that I ſhould live with Col. Smith. This was the third time of my being ſold, and I was then thirty-one years old. As I never had an opportunity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming myſelf whilſt I was owned by Miner, though be promiſed to give me a chance, I was then very ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of obtaining it. I aſked my maſter one time if he would conſent to have me purchaſe my freedom. He replied that he would. I was then very happy, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was at that time able to pay part of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe money, by means of the money which I ſome time ſince buried. This I took out of the earth and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to my maſter, having previouſly engaged a free negro man to take his ſecurity for it, as I was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of my maſter, and therefore could not ſafely take his obligation myſelf. What was wanting in redeeming myſelf, my maſter agreed to wait on me for, until I
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034560_0022_0FFE297FA65212E8"/>
could procure it for him. I ſtill continued to work for Col. Smith. There was continually ſome intereſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruing on my maſter's note to my friend the free negro man above named, which I received, and with ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which I got by fiſhing, I laid out in land adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my old maſter Stanton's. By cultivating this land with the greateſt diligence and economy, at times when my maſter did not require my labor, in two years I laid up ten pounds. This my friend tendered my maſter for myſelf, and received his note for it.</p>
               <p>Being encouraged by the ſucceſs which I had met in redeeming myſelf, I again ſolicited my maſter for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chance of completing it. The chance for which I ſolicited him was that of going out to work the enſuing winter. He agreed to this on condition that I would give him one quarter of my earnings. On theſe terms I worked the following winter, and earned four pounds ſixteen ſhillings, one quarter of which went to my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the privilege, and the reſt was paid him on my own account. This added to the other payments made up forty four pounds, eight ſhillings, which I had paid on my own account. I was then about thirty five years old.</p>
               <p>The next ſummer I again deſired he would give me a chance of going out to work. But he refuſed and anſwered that he muſt have my labor this ſummer, as he did not have it the paſt winter. I replied that I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it as hard that I could not have a chance to work out when the ſeaſon became advantageous, and that I muſt only be permitted to hire myſelf out in the pooreſt ſeaſon of the year. He aſked me after this what I would give him for the privilege per month. I replied that I would leave it wholly with his own generoſity to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what I ſhould return him a month. Well then, ſaid he, if ſo two pounds a month. I anſwered him that if that was the leaſt he would take I would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:034560_0023_0FFDC73317E7E750"/>Accordingly I hired myſelf out at Fiſher's Iſland, and earned twenty pounds; thirteen pounds ſix ſhillings of which my maſter drew for the privilege, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder I paid him for my freedom. This made fifty-one pounds two ſhillings which I paid him. In October following I went and wrought ſix months at Long Iſland. In that ſix month's time I cut and corded four hundred cords of wood, beſides threſhing out ſeventy-five buſhels of grain, and received of my wages down only twenty pounds, which left remaining a larger ſum. Whilſt I was out that time, I took up on my wages only one pair of ſhoes. At night I lay on the hearth, with one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlet over and another under me. I returned to my maſter and gave him what I received of my ſix months labor. This left only thirteen pounds eighteen ſhillings to make up the full ſum for my redemption. My maſter liberated me, ſaying that I might pay what was behind if I could ever make it convenient, otherwiſe it would be well. The amount of the money which I had paid my maſter towards redeeming my time, was ſeventy-one pounds two ſhillings. The reaſon of my maſter for aſking ſuch an unreaſonable price, was he ſaid, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf in caſe I ſhould ever come to want. Being thirty-ſix years old, I left Col. Smith once for all. I had already been ſold three different times, made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable money with ſeemingly nothing to derive it from, been cheated out of a large ſum of money, loſt much by misfortunes, and paid an enormous ſum for my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III. Containing an account of his life, from the time of his purchaſing his freedom to the preſent day.</head>
               <p>MY wife and children were yet in bondage to Mr. Thomas Stanton. About this time I loſt a cheſt, containing beſides clothing, about thirty-eight pounds in paper money. It was burnt by accident. A ſhort time after I ſold all my poſſeſſions at Stonington, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of a pretty piece of land and one dwelling houſe thereon, and went to reſide at Long-Iſland. For the firſt four years of my reſidence there, I ſpent my time in working for various people on that and at the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring iſlands. In the ſpace of ſix months I cut and corded upwards of four hundred cords of wood. Many other ſingular and wonderful labors I performed in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting wood there, which would not be inferior to thoſe juſt recited, but for brevity ſake I muſt omit them. In the aforementioned four years what wood I cut at Long-Iſland amounted to ſeveral thouſand cords, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which I earned thereby amounted to two hundred and ſeven pounds ten ſhillings. This money I laid up carefully by me. Perhaps ſome may enquire what main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained me all the time I was laying up money. I would inform them that I bought nothing which I did not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely want. All fine clothes I deſpiſed in compariſon with my intereſt, and never kept but juſt what clothes were comfortable for common days, and perhaps I would have a garment or two which I did not have on at all times, but as for ſuperfluous finery I never thought it to be compared with a decent homeſpun dreſs, a good ſupply of money and prudence. Expenſive gatherings of my mates I commonly ſhunned, and all kinds of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries I was perfectly a ſtranger to; and during the time
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034560_0025_0FFE29B1747BB6F8"/>
I was employed in cutting the aforementioned quantity of wood, I never was at the expence of ſix-pence worth of ſpirits. Being after this labour forty years of age, I worked at various places, and in particular on Ram-Iſland, where I purchaſed Solomon and Cuff, two ſons of mine, for two hundred dollars each.</p>
               <p>It will here be remembered how much money I earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by cutting wood in four years. Beſides this I had conſiderable money, amounting in all to near three hundred pounds. When I had purchaſed my two ſons, I had then left more than one hundred pounds. After this I purchaſed a negro man, for no other reaſon than to oblige him, and gave for him ſixty pounds. But in a ſhort time after he run away from me, and I thereby loſt all that I gave for him, except twenty pounds which he paid me previous to his abſconding. The reſt of my money I laid out in land, in addition to a farm which I owned before, and a dwelling houſe thereon. Forty four years had then completed their revolution ſince my entrance into this exiſtence of ſervitude and misfortune. Solomon my eldeſt ſon, being then in his ſeventeenth year, and all my hope and dependence for help, I hired him out to one Charles Church, of Rhode-Iſland, for one year, on conſideration of his giving him twelve pounds and an opportunity of acquiring ſome learning. In the courſe of the year, Church fitted out a veſſel for a whaling voyage, and being in want of hands to man her, he induced my ſon to go, with the promiſe of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him on his return, a pair of ſilver buckles, beſides his wages. As ſoon as I heard of his going to ſea, I immediately ſet out to go and prevent it if poſſible.— But on my arrival at Church's, to my great grief, I could only ſee the veſſel my ſon was in almoſt out of ſight going to ſea. My ſon died of the ſcurvy in this voyage, and Church has never yet paid me the leaſt of his wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. In my ſon, beſides the loſs of his life, I loſt equal to ſeventy-five pounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:034560_0026_0FFE2982AD2839F8"/>My other ſon being but a youth, ſtill lived with me. About this time I chartered a ſloop of about thirty tons burthen, and hired men to aſſiſt me in navigating her. I employed her moſtly in the wood trade to Rhode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland, and made clear of all expences above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dollars with her in better than one year. I had then become ſomething forehanded, and being in my forty-fourth year, I purchaſed my wife Meg, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by prevented having another child to buy, as ſhe was then pregnant. I gave forty pounds for her.</p>
               <p>During my reſidence at Long-Iſland, I raiſed one year with another, ten cart loads of water-melons, and loſt a great many every year beſides by the thieviſhneſs of the ſailors. What I made by the water-melons I ſold there, amounted to nearly five hundred dollars. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious other methods I purſued in order to enable me to redeem my family. In the night time I fiſhed with ſet-nets and pots for eels and lobſters, and ſhortly after went a whaling voyage in the ſervice of Col. Smith.— After being out ſeven months, the veſſel returned, laden with four hundred barrels of oil. About this time, I become poſſeſſed of another dwelling-houſe, and my temporal affairs were in a pretty proſperous condition. This and my induſtry was what alone ſaved me from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expelled that part of the iſland in which I reſided, as an act was paſſed by the ſelect-men of the place, that all negroes reſiding there ſhould be expelled.</p>
               <p>Next after my wife, I purchaſed a negro man for four hundred dollars. But he having an inclination to return to his old maſter, I therefore let him go. Shortly after I purchaſed another negro man for twenty-five pounds, whom I parted with ſhortly after.</p>
               <p>Being about forty-ſix years old, I bought my oldeſt child Hannah, of Ray Mumford, for forty-four pounds, and ſhe ſtill reſided with him. I had already redeemed from ſlavery, myſelf, my wife and three children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides three negro men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:034560_0027_0FFE29B2F6F2DD30"/>About the forty-ſeventh year of my life, I diſpoſed of all my property at Long-Iſland, and came from thence into Eaſt-Haddam. I hired myſelf out at firſt to Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Chapman, for five weeks, the earnings of which time I put up carefully by me. After this I wrought for Abel Bingham about ſix weeks. I then put my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney together and purchaſed of ſaid Bingham ten acres of land, lying at Haddam neck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where I now reſide.— On this land I labored with great diligence for two years, and ſhortly after purchaſed ſix acres more of land con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to my other. One year from that time I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed ſeventy acres more of the ſame man, and paid for it moſtly with the produce of my other land. Soon after I bought this laſt lot of land, I ſet up a comfortable dwelling houſe on my farm, and built it from the produce thereof. Shortly after I had much trouble and expence with my daughter Hannah, whoſe name has before been mentioned in this account. She was married ſoon after I redeemed her, to one Iſaac, a free negro, and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after her marriage fell ſick of a mortal diſeaſe; her huſband a diſſolute and abandoned wretch, paid but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle attention to her in her illneſs. I therefore thought it beſt to bring her to my houſe and nurſe her there. I procured her all the aid mortals could afford, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this ſhe fell a prey to her diſeaſe, after a lingering and painful endurance of it.</p>
               <p>The phyſician's bills for attending her during her ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amounted to forty pounds. Having reached my fifty-fourth year, a hired two negro men, one named William Jacklin, and the other Mingo. Mingo lived with me one year, and having received his wages, run in debt to me eight dollars, for which he gave me his note. Preſently after he tried to run away from me without troubling himſelf to pay up his note. I procured a warrant, took him, and requeſted him to go to Juſtice Throop's of his own accord, but he refuſing, I took him on my ſhoulders, and carried him there, diſtant
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:034560_0028_0FFE29859BD601D0"/>
about two miles. The juſtice aſking me if I had my priſoner's note with me, and replying that I had not, he told me that I muſt return with him and get it. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I carried Mingo back on my ſhoulders, but before we arrived at my dwelling, he complained of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurt, and aſked me if this was not a hard way of treating our fellow creatures. I anſwered him that it would be hard thus to treat our honeſt fellow creatures. He then told me that if I would let him off my ſhoulders, he had a pair of ſilver ſhoe-buckles, one ſhirt and a pocket handkerchief, which he would turn out to me. I agreed, and let him return home with me on foot; but the very following night, he ſlipped from me, ſtole my horſe and has never paid me even his note. The other negro man, Jacklin, being a comb-maker by trade, he requeſted me to ſet him up, and promiſed to reward me well with his labor. Accordingly I bought him a ſet of tools for making combs, and procured him ſtock. He worked at my houſe about one year, and then run away from me with all his combs, and owed me for all his board.</p>
               <p>Since my reſidence at Haddam neck, I have owned of boats, canoes and ſail veſſels, not leſs than twenty. Theſe I moſtly employed in the fiſhing and trafficking buſineſs, and in theſe occupations I have been cheated out of conſiderable money by people whom I traded with taking advantage of my ignorance of numbers.</p>
               <p>About twelve years ago, I hired a whale-boat and four black men, and proceeded to Long-Iſland after a load of round clams. Having arrived there, I firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed of James Webb, ſon of Orange Webb, ſix hundred and ſixty clams, and afterwards, with the help of my men, finiſhed loading my boat. The ſame even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, however, this Webb ſtole my boat, and went in her to Connecticut river, and ſold her cargo for his own benefit. I thereupon purſued him, and at length, after an additional expence of nine crowns, recovered the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:034560_0029_0FFE29B478017E70"/>
boat; but for the proceeds of her cargo I never could obtain any compenſation.</p>
               <p>Four years after, I met with another loſs, far ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to this in value, and I think by no leſs wicked means. Being going to New-London with a grand-child, I took paſſage in an Indian's boat, and went there with him. On our return, the Indian took on board two hogſheads of molaſſes, one of which belonged to Capt. Eliſha Hart, of Saybrook, to be delivered on his wharf. When we arrived there, and while I was gone, at the requeſt of the Indian, to inform Captain Hart of his arrival, and receive the freight for him, one hogſhead of the molaſſes had been loſt overboard by the people in attempting to land it on the wharf. Although I was abſent at the time, and had no concern whatever in the buſineſs, as was known to a number of reſpectable wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, I was nevertheleſs proſecuted by this conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious gentleman, (the Indian not being able to pay for it) and obliged to pay upwards of ten pounds lawful money, with all the coſts of court. I applied to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral gentlemen for counſel in this affair, and they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me, as my adverſary was rich, and threatened to carry the matter from court to court till it would coſt me more than the firſt damages would be, to pay the ſum and ſubmit to the injury; which I according did, and he has often ſince inſultingly taunted me with my unmerited misfortune. Such a proceeding as this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on a defenceleſs ſtranger, almoſt worn out in the hard ſervice of the world, without any foundation in reaſon or juſtice, whatever it may be called in a chriſtian land, would in my native country have been branded as a crime equal to highway robbery. But Captain Hart was a <hi>white gentleman,</hi> and I a <hi>poor Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> therefore it was <hi>all right, and good enough for the black dog.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am now ſixty nine years old. Though once ſtrait and tall, meaſuring without ſhoes ſix feet one inch and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:034560_0030_0FFE298B69BD5168"/>
an half, and every way well proportioned, I am now bowed down with age and hardſhip. My ſtrength which was once equal if not ſuperior to any man whom I have ever ſeen, is now enfeebled ſo that life is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and it is with fatigue that I can walk a couple of miles, ſtooping over my ſtaff. Other griefs are ſtill behind; on account of which ſome aged people, at leaſt, will pity me. My eye-ſight has gradually failed, till I am almoſt blind, and whenever I go abroad one of my grand-children muſt direct my way; beſides for many years I have been much pained and troubled with an ulcer on one of my legs. But amidſt: all my griefs and pains, I have many conſolations; Meg, the wife of my youth, whom I married for love, and bought with my money, is ſtill alive. My freedom is a privilege which nothing elſe can equal. Notwithſtanding all the loſſes I have ſuffered by fire, by the injuſtice of knaves, by the cruelty and oppreſſion of falſe hearted friends, and the perſidy of my own countrymen whom I have aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and redeemed from bondage, I am now poſſeſſed of more than one hundred acres of land, and three habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able dwelling houſes. It gives me joy to think that I <hi>have</hi> and that I <hi>deſerve</hi> ſo good a character, eſpecially for <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>integrity.</hi> While I am now looking to the grave as my home, my joy for this world would be full—IF my children, Cuff for whom I paid two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dollars when a boy, and Solomon who was born ſoon after I purchaſed his mother—If Cuff and Solomon —O! that they had walked in the way of their father. But a father's lips are cloſed in ſilence and in grief!— Vanity of vanities, all is vanity!</p>
