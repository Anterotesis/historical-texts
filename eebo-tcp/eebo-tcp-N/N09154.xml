            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>PLEASE to turn your eye on what you have wrote in the cloſe of your 3d page, in the 4th, and firſt half of the 5th, and ſeriouſly compare it with what I told you when you was at my houſe laſt fall. I then told you,
<q>I had not read the whole of your Inquiry, but only ſome extracts ſent me by a Gentleman, in whoſe faithfulneſs I could fully confide; from which I had given what you had read in my Dialogue.</q>
When you ſaid,
<q>Mr. Mills had wrote againſt the doctrine I remarked upon as yours, and that you, in anſwering him, had anſwered or obviated my objections againſt it, and that I ought to have waited till I had ſeen your anſwer:</q>
I replied,
<q>I had not ſeen Mr. Mills's piece, and had only heard in general that he had wrote againſt you, but did not know till now that he had oppoſed that doctrine of yours I remarked upon: And as to your anſwer to him, I had never heard of it before. You ſaid it had been advertiſed ſeveral months paſt. I told you it might be ſo but I had never heard any thing of the matter till now; and added, I am ſorry I did not know of it in ſeaſon, I would have waited a little to have ſeen it; but I did not tell you I was ſorry for what I had wrote. I further added to this purpoſe, that I did not deſign what I wrote upon your doctrine, as a full anſwer to all your reaſonings in its defence, but to make my own remarks upon it, viewing of it in various lights, not regarding whether the whole directly oppoſed your reaſonings or not.</q>
—I believe, Sir, you remember this converſation; I remember it well.</p>
            <p>Having read the above to Mr. Chapman, he gave me the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under his hand, and I preſent it to you.</p>

                  <p>I Hezekiah Chapman, of Say-Brook, waited on Mr. Hopkins to Mr. Hart's houſe, as he returned from Commencement laſt fall, and was preſent during the firſt part of their converſation. Mr. Hart having now read to me the narrative he gives Mr. Hopkins, in a letter to him, of the converſation which paſſed between them at that time, I well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member moſt of it; &amp; in particular, that Mr. Hart told him, he had not ſeen or read the whole of his Inquiry, but only ſome extracts from it, ſent him by a Gentleman; that he had not ſeen Mr. Mills's piece, and did not know that he had oppoſed the doctrine he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked upon as Mr. Hopkins's; that he had never heard till now that Mr. Hopkins was writing or publiſhing an anſwer to Mr. Mills; that he was ſorry he did not know it ſooner; he would have

            <p>How inconſiſtent with truth is the idea you raiſe in your readers mind? In the paſſages pointed to you above, you repreſent the caſe to the reader, and reaſon upon it, as ſuppoſing it true that I knew Mr. Mills had before wrote againſt that doctrine of yours which I cenſured as falſe, and that you was publiſhing a reply and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and on this ſuppoſition paint me in a falſe light, and flouriſh your colours in a characteriſtic manner. How could you do ſo? You muſt have ſtrangely forgot what I told you, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly impoſed on your readers by giving them a very wrong view of the matter, injurious to your brother, and calculated to raiſe in them an unjuſt reſentment againſt him. Do you think, Sir, our great Maſter will ſay to you, in reſpect to this,
<q>Well done, good and faithful ſervant?</q>
Surely ſuch carnal weapons of <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> very ill become the hands of the miniſters of righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>You ſay, Sir,
<q>Mr. H's friend took ſuch care not to tranſcribe any of my arguments for the ſentiment I eſpouſed, that he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully paſſed over the only ſentence in the firſt paragraph he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, which contained a reaſon for it, tho' he tranſcribed the words immediately before and after it.</q>
(p. 5.) I told you, when at my houſe, I had taken <hi>ſome</hi> things out of the extracts ſent me. I aimed to take enough to give my reader a juſt idea of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine I deſigned to remark upon, and omitted ſome other things. So you don't know whether the omiſſion you complain of was by my friend or me.—I obſerve you don't cenſure the extracts I pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed as giving a wrong repreſentation of your doctrine. Indeed you could not, without being condemned out of your own mouth. The reports to the contrary which have been ſpread among the people are intirely without ground. If I had tranſcribed all you ſay upon this doctrine in your Inquiry, and anſwer to Mr. Mills, the doctrine would have appeared juſt the ſame as it does in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts I gave, except in ſome views of it, <hi>more exceptionable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what purpoſe is the loud outcry you have raiſed? Do you think, Sir, that a man who has been in the miniſtry more than thirty years, and not wholly inattentive to what the <hi>ſcripture ſaith,</hi> is taxable with preſumptuous raſhneſs in cenſuring and remarking on a doctrine as falſe, which you have affirmed as true, unleſs he has firſt weighed and anſwered all you have ſaid in its defence? Indeed if I had undertaken to give a particular anſwer to all your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſupport of the error, I ought to have done it. My title
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011678_0004_0F87C8DA6E048868"/>
page expreſſed my deſign: '<hi>Brief Remarks on a number of falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſiti<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> '&amp;c.—Indeed I intended at firſt to have cenſured more of your dangerous errors, and took ſome pains to procure your books or proper extracts out of them, but was unhappily diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and ſo obliged to forbear. Will you, Sir, forgive me this wrong?</p>
            <p>You ſay, (p. 5.)
<q>I have ſuch an opinion of Mr. H. that I doubt not he is ſorry for what he has done, and heartily aſhamed of it.</q>
I have not ſeen cauſe yet, to extend my ſorrow further than to what I mentioned to you at my houſe. I am indeed ſorry you have ſo injuriouſly miſrepreſented the ſtate of facts, and hope you will be ſo too.</p>
            <p>In the next paragraph you ſay,
<q>If it ſhould be aſked, How could Mr. H ſay he had collected a few things <hi>out of many</hi> which are faulty, when he had never ſeen any thing I had wrote, except the words he produces? I muſt leave him to anſwer this queſtion.</q>
Since you are ſo mightily puzzled by it, I will do it.
<q>I had been informed by more than one credible perſon,</q>
(ſee your fifth page) yea, by more than two or three credible perſons, gentlemen of good memory, judgment and integrity, who had read your Inquiry and ſermons, what new and ſtrange doctrines you had taught in them. On the foot of this evidence I thought I might warrantably ſay in general, that your writings contained many things <hi>faulty.</hi> I have ſince read your Inquiry and Sermons, and find I was not impoſed upon, and that, as the Queen of Sheba ſaid to Solomon, <hi>the one half was not told me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You quote theſe words, (p. 6.)
<q>For their luſts ſake they bear partial enmity to the law of God;</q>
and reaſon from them as tho' I here uſed the word <hi>partial</hi> in a ſenſe directly oppoſed to <hi>total.</hi>— Don't you know, Sir, that you have here concealed my ſentiment from your reader, and ſubſtituted a very different one in its place? Is this to uſe him well? If you read what preceeds and follows this little ſcrap of a ſentence, with due attention, I think you could not but perceive I uſed the word <hi>partial</hi> there, in the ſame ſenſe as when we ſay of a corrupt judge, he is partial in his judgment. See the dialogue, p. 57, 58.</p>
            <p>In your 5th page you ſay,
<q>I implicitly grant that you and Dr. Whitaker are both right, if the doctrine of man's total depravity is admitted,</q>
(you had, I believe, no warrant to ſay ſo)
<q>and that the doctrine of regeneration by the <hi>immediate</hi> operation of the Spirit of God will follow, the doctrine of total depravity being allowed.</q>
Is this a blunder, Sir, or an inſtance of art? I neither denied, nor reaſoned againſt the <hi>immediate</hi> operation of the Spirit, &amp;c. but only againſt an operation <hi>without the word of goſpel truth,</hi> which you gentlemen have taught. The Spirit's operation may
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011678_0005_0F87C8DB2EFB7740"/>
be immediate, and yet be <hi>with the truth.</hi> If inſtead of <hi>immediate,</hi> you had ſaid the <hi>phyſical, miraculous</hi> operation of the Spirit, <hi>without giving light or communicating truth</hi> to the mind, this would have been a fair and juſt ſtating of the matter.—I obſerve, Sir, though you carefully avoid uſing the word phyſical in your writings on this ſubject, yet you uſe the word immediate in ſuch a manner as muſt convey to the diſcerning reader the ſame idea.</p>
            <p>You ſay, ſir, (p. 6.)
<q>The diſpute between him and me does, <hi>by his own acknowlegement,</hi> turn upon the doctrine of man's total depravity:</q>
(a very unwarrantable aſſertion)
<q>And Mr. H. has no other way to oppoſe Dr. Whitaker or me, but by denying this doctrine.</q>
(You are greatly miſtaken in this, ſir.)—
<q>The doctrine of man's total corruption in his natural unrenewed ſtate, which has been held by all ſound calviniſts from the reformation down to this day, and is expreſsly aſſerted by the aſſembly of divines at Weſtminſter, in their confeſſion and catechiſms: This doctrine, I ſay, is as falſe and dangerous an error as any of thoſe Mr. H. has oppoſed in Dr. W. or me: and more ſo if poſſible, as the former is the foundation of the latter; ſo that theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be oppoſed but by oppoſing that, which is <hi>really the only thing in diſpute.</hi>
               </q>
—This, ſir, is a very extraordinary paſſage. I ſuppoſe ſound calviniſts hold the general doctrine of man's total corruption; and that they do approve the ſubſtance of the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter confeſſion and catechiſms: But they are not obliged ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to agree in every tittle with that aſſembly, in the explanation they give of this corruption, in order to be ſound calviniſts, any more than with you and Dr. W. in your explanations. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, I believe they do generally like the Weſtminſter definition better than yours. They agree in the general doctrine of a total corruption, but their modes of explaining of it, circumſtantially differ; as the modes of explaining the doctrine of the trinity, uſed by the trinitarians do; and yet theſe are all <hi>ſound</hi> calviniſts, as the other are ſound trinitarians. <note n="§" place="bottom">The moſt moderate, believe that the grand principle of true piety and heavenly virtue is <hi>dead,</hi> and its root <hi>periſhed</hi> in the hearts of fallen man, and that it cannot be revived, but by a new plantation of the ſacred ſeed, ſent down from heaven, by Jeſus Chriſt, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the heart by the gracious influence of the holy Spirit, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural grace of God, adminiſtred by the goſpel; and that there are certain ſeeds of ſin in the hearts of all men, or natural principles and ſprings of action, which left to themſelves, uncontrouled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed by grace, will <hi>infallibly</hi> produce actual ſin, and bring forth fruit unto death; and that ſome of other of the paſſions or luſts of ſin have in fact the aſcendant in every heart of man, till the heavenly ſeed of virtue or true holineſs is planted by the Spirit of grace. <hi>All this is undoubtedly true.</hi>—The moſt rigid calviniſts profeſs to believe the Weſtminſter definition of the natural corruption, <hi>juſt</hi>; but it is obſervable that they, in their explanations, depart a little from the ſtrict literal ſenſe of the latter clauſe, viz.

Sir, between <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>perfect.</hi> Perhaps you are diſpoſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment yourſelf as a perfect Calviniſt: but I think if you can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be admitted at all as a Calviniſt, you ought to be eſteemed a <hi>corrupt</hi> one, relating to the doctrines now in view. You, ſir, and Dr. W. with ſome others among us, have carried orthodoxy to ſuch prodigious exceſs that it is, in your hands, degenerated into heterodoxy. But is it not a preſumptuous thing in you to ſet up yours, and Dr. W's particular explanations of the general doctrine of the total depravity as the <hi>ſtandard</hi> of <hi>ſoundneſs</hi> in this article? What poſſible pretence can you have for this, more than the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Mr. Baxter, Dr. Watts, Dr. Doddridge, and a thouſand more great names? There are, ſir, great numbers of ſound Calviniſts who will never conſent to lie down and be ſtretched upon your bed. None indeed need to fear their feet will be cut off as too long.</p>
            <p>But let us, ſir, view the ſtandard you have implicitly ſet up as the reſt of a ſound belief relating to the doctrine of the corruption of nature. It is this,
<q>
                  <hi>The</hi> enmity of man's heart is levelled <hi>directly</hi> againſt God's <hi>whole moral character</hi> as being hateful to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man, <hi>in itſelf,</hi> or <hi>for its own ſake</hi>; that this enmity is wro't into the very frame of the human heart, and is of ſuch a nature- and ſo confirmed a principle, that no poſſible applications of goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truths to the mind and heart can ſubdue or weaken it: The Spirit of God himſelf can't overcome it by applyimg goſpel truth and the doctrines of grace to the heart. But on the contrary, the more a natural man ſees of the light and truth of God's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the more in proportion does his hatred of it riſe and exert itſelf.</q>
This, ſir, is a juſt ſummary of the doctrine you and Dr. W. have taught relating to the natural enmity. I know indeed you do both of you frequently contradict yourſelves; but this doctrine comes out at laſt as what you hold to. I could eaſily collect as large a ſection of <hi>ſtriking</hi> inconſiſtencies from your Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Sermons, as you have from the aged Mr. Mills; but that would not pleaſe or edify the public more than your fragrant poſey did.</p>
            <p>But is it really as you ſay, that a man can't diſbelieve and oppoſe <hi>this</hi> doctrine concerning the <hi>enmity,</hi> but he muſt diſbelieve, and conſequentially deny the doctrine of a <hi>total</hi> corruption? Is this latter doctrine really the <hi>only</hi> thing in diſpute? You could not have ſuggeſted any thing more exceptionable. You have put the controverſy upon a wrong foot; no ſound Calviniſt will join iſſue with you here. The general doctrine of the total depravity is not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011678_0007_0F87C8DC9D4D4438"/>
at all in diſpute. Men who admit this doctrine do, and may very conſiſtently deny your doctrine concerning the nature of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: for they believe the corruption is of the moral kind, and in its nature <hi>curable</hi> by an application of that ſupernatural doctrine of truth and grace which came by Jeſus Chriſt, in ſuch a manner as the holy Spirit knows how to apply it. There is an eſſential differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between your doctrine concerning the enmity, (on which that other doctrine I oppoſed, is built) and their doctrine of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Indeed, ſir, it appears to me, that you have treated your readers very ill, in thus making them loſe ſight of the merits of the cauſe, and ſubſtituting quite another thing in its place, as being, you tell them, '<hi>really the only thing in diſpute.</hi>' Some, no doubt, will believe you, and be filled with fervent zeal And the glory will be yours of blowing up an <hi>unhallowed</hi> flame, founded in <hi>miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation.</hi> If you have miſled them thro' inadvertence and without deſign; I hope they will eaſily forgive you this wrong: But if it was done with deſign, it is artful enough, but how <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope, ſir, for your ſake, it was only a confuſion in your tho'ts that cauſed you ſo wrongly to ſtate the controverſy. Perhaps ſir, you will ſay, I have not told you what my ſentiments are relating to the general doctrine of a <hi>total</hi> corruption. I have told you what they are not. I will further ſay, in general, I apprehend they are much nearer the Calviniſtic doctrine than yours are, and to the ſcriptures of truth. But you appear to have a great diſpoſition to have your readers think me an Arminian; and I ſuppoſe, think you ſhall find your account in it. I ſuffer you to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Perhaps I may ſoon have opportunity to let the public know more fully what my ſentiments are relating to theſe matters.</p>
            <p>What you ſay, p. 8. I paſs over as unworthy of notice — It affords a ſtriking inſtance of unfairneſs and miſrepreſentation. As ſuch I recommend it to your ſerious review.</p>
            <p>I obſerve, ſir, that in your following pages, you very carefully keep up the miſrepreſentation of the merits of the controverſy, which I took notice of above, and labour to perſuade your readers it is genuine Calviniſm that is oppoſed as a new ſyſtem of errors. In this you impoſe upon your readers. Some will ſee it, others will not.— You ſay, p 9.
<q>I queſtion whether an author can, with a right temper and view, take this method to run any doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine down, by appealing to the prejudices of the people</q>
Why then did you do ſo? You have done it, I think, in an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner.</p>
            <p>You are pleaſed to cenſure me very ſeverely for calling the ſcheme of doctrines, ſome of which I remarked upon, a <hi>new</hi> ſcheme. And refer to the ſynod of Dort, and Weſtminſter aſſembly as
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011678_0008_0F87C8DD5FB0A7D8"/>
teachers of theſe things, and ſay,
<q>if I had called all the calviniſtie doctrines <hi>quite new,</hi> it would not have been more contrary to apparent fact.</q>
p. 10, 11, 12. Some of your brethren in this ſcheme have acknowledged it in ſome reſpects new, they ſpeak of new diſcoveries &amp; further improvements in divinity. I heard one of them, not long ſince, in a public diſcourſe, after he had drawn the outlines of the <hi>new</hi> ſcheme, apply himſelf to obviate the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that might ariſe againſt it as in ſome meaſure new; and to this purpoſe he obſerved, that new diſcoveries &amp; further improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had lately been made in philoſophy, and other branches of natural ſcience, and why ſhould not the like be expected in divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? I wiſh you gentlemen, had made any further improvements in <hi>true</hi> divinity.</p>
            <p>If ſir, you had fairly repreſented the doctrines I remarked upon as erroneous, you would have made but a <hi>poor</hi> figure in repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them as the ancient and eſtabliſhed doctrines of calviniſm, and of the Weſtminſter aſſembly of divines.—Suffer me ſir, to preſent you with a number of doctrines which belong to that ſcheme of divinity I call a <hi>new ſcheme.</hi> A juſt ſummary of the doctrines concerning the enmity I have given you above. To theſe I add the following, viz.
<q>Men are <hi>not converted</hi> to God— by any rational arguments, whereby <hi>their hearts are perſwaded</hi> to turn from ſin to God.— I don't think that regeneration is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.—by preſenting the things of religion to their minds, or even by <hi>opening their eyes to ſee them.</hi>

               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Hopkins's Sermons.</note> I refer you to your ſermons for many more corrupt doctrines which belong to the new ſcheme of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. I do not aſk you to prove your new doctrines true, by the holy ſcriptures. This I know is impoſſible. But prove them to be calviniſtic, by the Weſtminſter aſſembly of divines, and fairly reconcile them with the following propoſitions delivered by them, and I will no longer call your ſcheme <hi>new,</hi> tho' it is very corrupt and deſtructive. In their confeſſion, chap. 10th, they ſay, God does effectually call the elect,
<q>
                  <hi>by his word</hi> and ſpirit,— <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> their minds, ſpiritually and ſavingly to underſtand the things of God, taking away the heart of ſtone,</q>
&amp;c. In their brief ſum of chriſtian doctrine, which was alſo received by the general aſſembly of the calviniſtic church of Scotland, they ſay, Head 3d.
<q>The outward means for making men partakers of the covenant of grace are ſo wiſely diſpenced as the elect ſhall be infallibly <hi>converted</hi> and ſaved <hi>by them.</hi> Theſe means are 1ſt. <hi>the word of God.</hi>
               </q>
Under the 4th head they ſay,
<q>
                  <hi>By theſe</hi> outward ordinances</q>
(means of grace)
<q>our Lord, in the power of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011678_0009_0F87C8E201195770"/>
applies unto the elect <hi>all ſaving graces,</hi> and maketh a <hi>change in their perſons.</hi> 1ſt. He doth <hi>convert OR REGENERATE</hi> them by giving <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> unto them.</q>
(How does he effect this?)
<q>
                  <hi>In opening their underſtandings,</hi> renewing their wills, affections &amp; faculties.</q>
Surely ſir, this Weſtminſter bed is ſhorter than that you can ſtretch yourſelf upon it; the covering is narrower than that you can decently wrap yourſelf in it.—Perhaps you will ſay, Divines ſometimes diſtinguiſh between <hi>paſſive</hi> and active con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, &amp;c. Some do expreſs themſelves in this obſcure, improper manner. To ſpeak more intelligibly, their is a diſtinction to be made between the action of the Spirit of God on the mind, in which the mind is paſſive as acted upon, and the action of the mind anſwering thereto. The Weſtminſter aſſembly ſpeak to this purpoſe in their confeſſion, chap. 10. art. 2. ſpe<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>g of God's effectual call of man, they ſay,
<q>he is altogether paſſive therein, until being quickened and renewed by the holy Spirit, he is thereby enabled to anſwer this call, and embrace the grace offered.</q>
Your doctrine eſſentially differs from theirs in this; you ſay to this purpoſe, this action of the Spirit quickening or regenerating the mind, is wholly without impreſſing on the mind any idea or ſenſe of the truth, or communicating any new light to the ſoul, a mere act of creating power, and that the truth is not uſed by him at all as a means and inſtrument in this work: (this ſir, is the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine you and Dr. W. have plainly taught, and which I oppoſed) but they teach to this purpoſe, as we have ſeen above, that in the quickening action, or regenerating work of the Spirit he uſes goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truth as his means or inſtrument, inlightening the mind ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and ſavingly to underſtand the things of God, impreſſing a ſtrong ſenſe of them on the heart, under, and by which action and influence the man is quickened and enabled to anſwer the call and embrace the grace offered. So we muſt underſtand them, or they will be involved in contradiction.</p>
            <p>In this view of their doctrine it is true. It is you ſir, who are departed from the Weſtminſter doctrine in this particular.—You alſo ſay, Repentance preceeds faith, but they repreſent it as the fruit of faith, as all ſound calviniſts do. In their ſhorter catechiſm they ſay,
<q>Repentance is a ſaving grace, whereby a ſinner out of a true ſenſe of his ſin, and apprehenſion of the mercy of God in Chriſt, doth with grief and hatred of his ſin, turn from it unto God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You obſerve ſir, (p. 12.) that in my dialogue, I ſay, God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly <hi>ſubdues</hi> the <hi>enmity, changes</hi> and <hi>reconciles</hi> the ſoul, by <hi>letting in the light,</hi> and ſweet, <hi>attractive ſenſe</hi> of his <hi>holy truth and love</hi>; and that I add,
<q>The <hi>new</hi> divines indeed are ſo bold as to ſay, all this is not ſufficient to convert and <hi>reconcile</hi> one ſoul.</q>
On this you
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011678_0010_0F87C8E3B5C215C0"/>
are pleaſed to ſay,
<q>Mr. H. cannot find, I truſt, any divine, old or new, that ever did, or ever will ſay this. I think I may ſafely pronounce this as <hi>falſe</hi> a propoſition as <hi>can</hi> be collected from any author whatever.</q>
Pleaſe ſir, to turn your eye on what I quoted from Dr. Whitaker juſt now; and obſerve theſe other paſſages in his ſermons,
<q>The wonderful manifeſtations of God's love and grace in the goſpel, with all the moving and melting accents of his mercy, are <hi>not ſufficient</hi> to <hi>prevail</hi> with one ſinner to make up the quarrel with God. p. 44. The manifeſtation of the divine glory by Chriſt, tranſcends every other method in which God hath revealed his perfection;— but all this <hi>ſerves not</hi> to <hi>engage</hi> unrenewed man to love, but more ſenſibly to abhor God, in proportion to the clearer manifeſtation of his nature and perfection.</q>
p. 50. If ſo God does not ſubdue the enmity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and reconcile the ſoul, by letting in the light, and attractive ſenſe of his holy truth and love. For the ſenſe thereof acts in the heart as a <hi>repulſive</hi> force.—</p>
            <p>Mr. Hopkins, in his ſermon on Joh. 1.13. ſays,
<q>Light is not, <hi>cannot</hi> be given <hi>antecedent</hi> to regeneration <hi>in order to influence or change the heart or will.</hi>—The more the divine character, and the things of God's moral kingdom — are ſeen and underſtood — by ſuch an one,</q>
(by any man who is not firſt regenerated and changed) 'the greater will be the mind's diſguſt at them.' and the more it will hate them p. 41, 42. 'Light and truth is not in <hi>any degree</hi> the <hi>means by which</hi> this change is effected.' p. 39. He ſays much more to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I truſt, ſir, you will admit theſe gentlemen as good witneſſes. If you do, my propoſition, which you ſay is notoriouſly falſe, is fully proved to be true, and my accuſer turns out poorly. I am ſorry for him; but ſee no way how you can bring him off but by ſaying, Mr. Hopkins and Dr. W. are no divines.—Many other charges of falſe aſſertions, as indefenſible as that above, I paſs over unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, particularly that poor one in the margin, p. 13. and that mean ſuggeſtion in the margin, p. 16.</p>
            <p>I obſerve, ſir, you complain of injury and falſhood in that I ſometimes call the new doctrines Sandemanean errors. When you objected this to me at my houſe, I anſwered that the new ſcheme and Sandeman's are near akin, coincident in ſome things, and both come to much the ſame iſſue. More than this is not pretended in the dialogue, tho' in ſome particular paſſages I may have expreſſed myſelf too looſely. If your ſmiting was that of the righteous, I would eſteem it as excellent oil. But unhappily for you, you are come abroad this time in the ſpirit of a Jew at the cloſe of his faſt. As the teachers of the <hi>new</hi> ſcheme of doctrine had not given it a <hi>new</hi> name, I was a little in doubt what name it ought to be called by.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011678_0011_0F87C8E4564A0630"/>
Calviniſm I could not call it, without miſleading my readers. It appeared to me much nearer related to Sandeman than to Calvin, ſo I ſometimes looſely called it the Sandemanean ſcheme. But ſince it diſpleaſes, I forbear. Pleaſe, ſir, to give the <hi>poor ſtranger</hi> a proper name. It is your right to name your own children. If it is called after your own name, I believe nobody will be diſpleaſed.</p>
            <p>You, ſir, labour to convince your readers that I have embraced ſeveral of Mr. Sandeman's diſtinguiſhing doctrines and know it not, (p. 14.) This is pleaſant enough. Firſt of all you repreſented me as agreeing with the Devil, (p. 8.) now with Mr. Sandeman. If your wrath riſe a little higher, I fear you will undertake next to prove that I have alſo embraced Mr. Hopkins's ſentiments, and knew it not.—You have actually done ſo, towards the cloſe of your letter.</p>
            <p>Speaking of Mr. Edwards's piece on the nature of virtue, you obſerve, that his notion of virtue and natural conſcience, &amp;c.
<q>are <hi>fundamental</hi> to the ſcheme of doctrines I oppoſe.</q>
They are ſo! And his notion of virtue is new and ſtrange, and the ſcheme you have built upon it new—Both muſt ſtand or fall together. You aſk,
<q>Why did not Mr. Hart take this diſſertation in hand, and cenſure and confute it? This would be—laying the ax to the root of the tree.</q>
It would.—I will alſo tell you why I did not. I had not then ſeen that diſſertation, tho' I had heard of it. If I had ſeen that, and your ſermons before I wrote, my dialogue would, in ſome reſpects, have been more perfect. I have ſince read that diſſertation, and laid the ax to the root of the tree; and perhaps ſhall publiſh ſome remarks upon it, ſhewing that Mr. Edwards's notions of virtue, of the <hi>primary</hi> and <hi>ſecondary</hi> beauty of moral things, &amp;c. are wrong, imaginary, and fatally deſtructive of the foundations of morality and true religion: If I do, I hope to have the piece out of the preſs by next commencement. Since you think this will be doing ſomething, and that I ought to have done it before, I preſume this intelligence will pleaſe you, and that you will ſubſcribe for a dozen copies, at leaſt.</p>
            <p>You ſay, (p. 17.)
<q>One deſign of preſident Edwards's piece on virtue, is to ſhew that men have <hi>naturally no degree</hi> of <hi>true</hi> virtue, but are wholly corrupt. And he has there conſidered the very things Mr. H. ſays to <hi>prove the contrary</hi>—and ſhews, that what Mr. H. calls <hi>virtue</hi> and an approbation of moral good, is nothing but natural conſcience and natural taſte, both which are conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the—moſt perfect corruption of heart, and oppoſition to all moral good.</q>
Here, ſir, if I underſtand your meaning, you lead your reader to think I have ſaid and endeavored to prove that men have <hi>naturally ſome degree of true virtue,</hi> and that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corruption is partial, as limited and reſtricted by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011678_0012_0F87C8E4DC78E8F0"/>
degree of <hi>true</hi> virtue in the heart naturally; and that I repreſent the approbation which natural conſcience or the natural moral taſte gives to virtue or moral good, ſimply conſidered as ſuch, as a <hi>truly virtuous</hi> approbation, or an exerciſe of ſome degree of true virtue, natural to the heart of man. In all this you impoſe upon your reader, and abuſe his confidence in you. I ſaid nothing of all this, and what is more, I have not tho't it. You have given here as wrong an idea of what I ſaid, and of what I believe, as could well be given. If you tho't yourſelf warranted to ſay this of me, by what I ſaid in the ſecond dialogue, you muſt have read it with very little attention or great partiality.—I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to intimate that I think Mr. Edwards's notions of the nature of true virtue are right. They are eſſentially wrong, and the view you give of my ſentiments is eſſentially wrong. If you ever ſee my remarks on his piece, you will know more fully what my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents are. In the mean time, I pray you not injuriouſly to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent me any more, as you have done thro'out your animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions. Is it not too much like the conduct of the old heathen in dreſſing up the chriſtians in bears ſkins, and ſetting their dogs upon them? If you write again in a controverſial way, I wiſh you to honor yourſelf as a fair and equitable writer and reaſoner. This is what we are commanded. And your ſpirit and manner ought to be very good, to make ſome amends for the badneſs of your principles.</p>
            <p>I obſerve, ſir, what you ſay, (p. 18.) relating to my mentioning a paſſage in Dr. Bellamy's ſermon, at the college chappel, &amp;c.— In anſwer to this, I will only remind you of what I told you; when at my houſe you profeſſed your ſelf offended with me for mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it I thus told you,
<q>I had my information concerning the doctrine there delivered from four or five gentlemen who heard that diſcourſe,</q>
(this was at different times, each one giving me his information in the abſence of the others)
<q>that after I had wrote what I at firſt tho't proper on that head, I ſhewed it to ſundry of my informers, deſiring them to obſerve whether my repreſentation was juſt, (two of them were the Dr's particular friends) and reduced it to what I finally publiſhed, as what the moſt ſcrupulous ſaid he well remembered the Dr. did ſay, if not in thoſe very words, yet to the ſame purpoſe: I obſerved further, that a diſcourſe, once delivered in ſo public a manner, becomes public property.</q>
All this ſeemed to calm your reſentment: But an evil ſpirit ſeems now to trouble you.</p>
            <p>I obſerve, Sir, you endeavor (p. 19 to 2<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>.) to perſuade your readers I am inconſiſtent with myſelf in ſundry important particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and really own the doctrines I condemn: I don't think it needful to anſwer you particularly as to this. The inconſiſtencies
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011678_0013_0F87C8E5A0EAAA90"/>
you complain of are of your own making. The appearance of contradictions is the reſult of your miſconſtructions, miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and falſe colourings. Pray, ſir, turn a ſerious thought on what you have wrote in the laſt paragraph of your 24th p. and firſt part of the 25th. You know, ſir, that in dialogue writing, one of the ſpeakers <hi>only</hi> perſonates the author, and is ſuppoſed to ſpeak his ſentiments, the others not, only ſo far as he approves or admits them; and that in my dialogue the clergyman perſonates the writer. In the paſſage you refer to, (in p. 67 of the dialogue) I made the gentleman ſay,
<q>all reaſonable and honeſt men, I think, can be at no loſs to determine on which ſide the truth lies.</q>
— This I did (as ſuppoſing ſome perſons, more zealous than charitable, would be ready to make ſuch a raſh concluſion) that I might cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it as unjuſt, and inculcate a more charitable and generous ſentiment; which I make the clergyman do immediately, in his reply. All this muſt be obvious to every intelligent and impartial reader. Yet you are pleaſed to repreſent this ſentiment of the Gentleman, firſt, in a falſe and very aggravated light, and then to impute it to me, and repreſent me as thinking all the moſt noted Calviniſt divines are unreaſonable and <hi>diſhoneſt</hi> men; and cry out, 'This a bold ſtroke indeed.' This of yours is indeed a bold ſtroke. —You next repreſent me as a little ſhocked at this ſevere cenſure, and attempting to correct and ſoften it; but to very little purpoſe, according to your repreſentation. If I was your enemy (which I am not) I could not wiſh you to diſhonor yourſelf more, than, I think you have done in this ſurpriſing paragraph, and indeed thro' this whole piece. In this paragraph your reaſoning ſuppoſes that
<q>the Weſtminſter aſſembly, and many of the moſt noted divines in New-England, and elſewhere,</q>
agree with you and Dr. W. and that I in cenſuring your peculiar ſentiments equally cenſured theirs. This is a favorite repreſentation. I believe this will be tho't unjuſt by the judicious: and it ought to be ſo tho't by you, if you would be conſiſtent with yourſelf; for you ſay, (p. 28)
<q>I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time tho't the doctrines which have of late been called by many <hi>new divinity,</hi> are really a revival and <hi>improvement</hi> of ſound Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.</q>
'Tis only ſo far as they are what you call an <hi>improvement</hi> that others call them <hi>new,</hi> and that I cenſured them as <hi>falſe.</hi> And thus far they are not patroniſed by the reſpectable body of Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt divines 'from the reformation down to this day.' How could they? The improvements you ſpeak of are <hi>new.</hi> Mr. Edwards's poſthumous piece, on virtue, you acknowlege is
<q>the <hi>root</hi> of the tree;</q>
which you have cultivated and adorned with many of its branches.</p>
            <p>You ſay, ſir,
<q>It is reported that a number of miniſters in New-England, who were zealous promoters of the revival of religion
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011678_0014_0F87C8E68E06DDB8"/>
(about 30 years ago) and did then abundantly preach up the doctrine of total depravity, do now profeſs their approbation of Mr. H's piece. If any ſuch there are, <hi>it becomes them to know</hi> that they have indeed changed ſides, and departed from the faith they once earneſtly contended for.</q>
And you, ſir, have rebuked them ſharply that they may be ſound in the faith. But I beſpeak your pity and tenderneſs for them. Poor gentlemen, they have embraced Arminian errors, and are become oppoſers of revived re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, 'and know it not!' and I believe never would have known it, if you had not revealed it to them. If they go no farther than to pity you, you ought to be thankful to them for their lenity.</p>
            <p>You are pleaſed to ſay, my objections againſt the new ſcheme, are in ſubſtance the ſame that Arminians have always made againſt Calviniſm. I believe, Sir, you are under ſome miſtake in this.— But ſuppoſe it ſo, they may lie againſt your doctrines, and be unanſwerable on your principles, tho' not ſo on Calviniſtic princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Suppoſe a foreign body plays cannon againſt his Majeſty's fort; may not the King's ſoldiers after this point the ſame cannon againſt a fort erected by the Pretender, and be blameleſs? Would you call them the King's enemies becauſe they do ſo?</p>
            <p>I paſs over many other things in your animadverſions, which deſerve to be animadverted upon. Indeed you have ſaid very little but what merits cenſure.</p>
            <p>I have heard Dr. Whitaker is writing againſt the dialogue, you intimate as much; and ſuppoſe your animadverſions are ſent out as his <hi>forerunner.</hi> They are well adapted to prejudice people in favor of what he may have to offer. But I queſtion whether the method you have taken is calculated to give them <hi>ears to hear</hi> with that impartiality which becomes chriſtian men. Your forerunner, as we have ſeen, has made ſtrait ways crooked, and ſmooth ways ruff. I hope the Dr. will have more wiſdom than to walk in your prepared road.</p>
            <p>I have two requeſts to make to you ſir, if you will be ſo good as to hear them; firſt, that you will once more review your ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions, with ſolemn ſeriouſneſs, and blame yourſelf before God for whatever you have reaſon to think is diſpleaſing to him in them, or in the ſpirit with which they are wrote. Indeed ſir, you do not write with a good ſpirit. In your reply to Mr. Mills you treated that worthy father <hi>very ill,</hi> in an ungenerous and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy manner. This is the judgment of all I have heard ſpeak of it, who have read it. And now, beſides miſrepreſenting many things to your readers, you have manifeſtly endeavoured to injure me, and render me the object of unjuſt popular odium and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and to this purpoſe have ſaid many things, which, for your ſake, I was ſorry to ſee. So far as I am injured by you, I am
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011678_0015_0F87C8EAD327DEA0"/>
ready to forgive you, whenever you are in a prepared diſpoſition to aſk and receive God's forgiveneſs; which, I wiſh we may both obtain for all our wrongneſſes, and grace thoroughly to ſweeten and chriſtianize our ſpirits.</p>
            <p>My ſecond requeſt to you ſir, is, that you will calmly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially review the <hi>new</hi> doctrines you have advanced, and no more perplex and corrupt the doctrines of truth, by mingling them with metaphyſical notions, <hi>falſly</hi> ſo called. The obſervation of preſident Edwards, which you mention'd to me in converſation, is juſt, viz.
<q>That no man is under greater temptation than an author who has unhappily advanced indefenſible doctrines.</q>
This is eminently ſo, when he has expected to get himſelf a name thereby. It may be <hi>hard</hi> to overcome this temptation, but it muſt be done. We ought ſir, to be ſo much above our ſelves as to be able to re-examine our own public doctrines with as great impartiality as thoſe of any other man, and to retract and cenſure them, once ſeen to be erroneous, as freely as the errors of any other. What are we? what is our honour, as contraſted with the truth itſelf, and with the honor of the great teacher of truth? How much lighter than the ſmalleſt duſt of the ballance? I am ſtrongly convinced ſir, I believe, on the foot of the clear<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> and fulleſt evidence, that your ſcheme of doctrine relating to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enmity, regeneration, and their conſequences, is falſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the goſpel of God; and am perſwaded you are maſter of ſo much diſcerning and judgment, that if you can re-examine it with ſtrict impartiality, free from prejudice, you will ſee it to be ſo, and repudiate it. I am not about to reaſon with you upon this ſubject; but ſuffer me to ſuggeſt one thing: Your ſcheme is, in many reſpects, inconſiſtent with itſelf, and with ſundry goſpel truths which you hold: and you know <hi>truth</hi> is <hi>ſelf-conſiſtent throughout.</hi> I will only mention one of your inconſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. You ſir, and all the brotherhood, ſo far as I have ſeen, ſay the natural corruption, enmity, and impotence of the heart, is <hi>wholly</hi> of the <hi>moral</hi> kind, and that the change which is wrought in what you call regeneration, is a <hi>moral,</hi> not a phyſical change; and yet you ſay, this change is not, and cannot poſſibly be effected by a <hi>moral</hi> influence and power of the Spirit of God, <hi>with the goſpel truth</hi>; that it is, and can be effected only by a phyſical or <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous operation of the Spirit, without giving light, or applying goſpel truth. You muſt, Sir, make both phyſical, or both <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, or remain intangled in inconſiſtency: But the <hi>truth</hi> is not thus bound. To detect and renounce your own errors will be greater glory to you, than it would be to proſtitute the whole chriſtian world to the belief of them. I only add my friendly wiſh that you may attain this height of glory, and henceforth ſpeak the pure,

               <hi>unadulterated</hi> truth, <hi>in love</hi>; and am, though treated in an injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unfrindly and ungentlemanly manner,</p>
