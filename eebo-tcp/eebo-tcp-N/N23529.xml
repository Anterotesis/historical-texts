            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>FROM the amiable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have heard of you, both in this country (where I have reſided many years in the various ſpheres of life) and in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, I am induced to dedicate to you this publication.</p>
            <p>When I laſt returned to this country, I did myſelf the honor to wait upon your Excellency, in September, 1796, before your reſignation of the Preſidency of the United States, and preſented to you a Poem I compoſed upon the <hi>"Rural and Romantic Scenes of</hi> DOWN HILL," near Colerain, Ireland, the ſeat of the Earl of Briſtol, and Biſhop of the Dioceſe of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donderry—for a copy of which, many of the gentlemen of that country gave me a guinea.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency was ſo humane and condeſcending, as to countenance my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="IV" facs="unknown:031170_0003_0FEAE54AEF161B90"/>
of publiſhing by ſubſcription, a Poem, ſuited to the then preſent ſtate of America, for which I obtained above 1200 ſubſcribers. And your Excellency's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending and polite letter, for tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Poem to you at Mount Vernon, merits By moſt ſincere gratitude.</p>
            <p>The Book now publiſhed may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all deſcriptions of both ſexes, as the times are indeed alarming, and the art of contentment rendered an eſſential ſtudy of mankind, in purſuit of <hi>real happineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhould have done myſelf the pleaſure of waiting on your Excellency, for liberty of addreſſing the following Treatiſe to your patronage, but an indiſpoſition, and fear of tranſgreſſing on your delicacy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented—As it is only to gentlemen of ſuperior rank and noted abilities, we can look for literary encouragement in any country for promoting learning and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. May every encourager of this work join me in fervent prayer to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that every real felicity may ever await your Excellency.</p>
            <p>I have the honor to ſubſcribe myſelf, with the moſt profound reſpect and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Sir, Your Excellency's moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, and obedient humble Servant,</p>

to his former capacity of bliſs. And that it might not only be a bare capacity, he has added all other methods proper to work upon a rational creature. He has ſhewn him his danger, ſet before him in perſpective that eternal Tophet, which he is adviſed to ſhun. On the other ſide, he has no leſs lively deſcribed the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeruſalem, the celeſtial Country to which he is to aſpire: Nay farther, has levelled his road to it, leads him, not as he did the Iſraelites through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, through intricate mazes to puzzle his underſtanding; through <hi>a land of drought, wherein were fiery ſerpents and ſcorpions,</hi> Deut. viii. 15. to diſcourage and affright him, but has in the Goſpel chalked out a plain, a ſafe, nay a pleaſant path. as much ſuperior both in the eaſe of the way, and in the end to which it leads, as Heaven is to <hi>

But alas, if we look upon the univerſality of men, we ſhall find it nothing ſo, but while all other creatures gladſomely follow the order of their creation, take pleaſure in thoſe things God has aſſigned for them, we with a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len perverſeneſs quarrel at what we ſhould enjoy, and in every thing make it our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, not to fit it for our uſe, but to find out ſome concealed quality which may render it unfit.

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031170_0014_0FEB1357A50CC590"/>
to pick a quarrel, and ſtart a pretence for mutining. From hence it is that man who was deſigned the lord of the world, to whoſe ſatisfaction all inferior beings were to contribute, is now the unhappieſt of the creatures: Nay as if the whole order of the univerſe were inverted, he becomes ſlave to his own vaſſals, courts all theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſublunary things with ſuch paſſion, that if they prove coy and fly his embraces, he is mad and deſperate; if they fling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into his arms, he is then glutted and ſatiated; like Amnon, <hi>he hates more than he loved,</hi> 2 Sam. xiii. 15. and is ſicker of his poſſeſſion, than he was of his deſire.</p>

field, becauſe we have perhaps more mind to our neighbors, we may thank ourſelves if we ſtarve.

               <p>THE firſt propoſition that God is deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to no man, is too clear and apparent to require much of illuſtration: For as he is a free agent, and may act as he pleaſes, ſo he is the ſole proprietary, and can wrongfully detain from none, becauſe all original right is in himſelf. This has been ſo much acknowledged by the blindeſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that none of them durſt make inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent addreſſes to their gods, challenge any thing of them as of debt, but by ſacrifices and prayers owned their dependance and wants, and implored ſupplies. And ſure, chriſtianity teaches us not to be more ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. If thoſe deities who owed their very being to their votaries, were yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the ſpring and ſource of all, we can with no pretence deny it to that ſuprenſe power, in <hi>whom we live, move, and have our being,</hi> Acts xvii. 28. For if it were merely an act of his choice to give us a being, all his ſubſequent bounties can have no other original than his own good pleaſure. We could put no obligation upon God before we were; and when we began to be, we were his creatures, and ſo by the moſt indiſputable right owe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, but can have no antecedent
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031170_0022_0FEB136F8E351D90"/>
title on which to claim any thing from him: So that the apoſtle might well make the challenge which he doth on God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, <hi>Who hath given any thing unto him, and it ſhall be recompenced to him again?</hi> Rom. xi. 35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now ordinary diſcretion teaches us, not to be too bold in our expectation from one to whom we can plead no right. It has as little of prudence as modeſty, to preſs impudently upon the bounty of a patron, and does but give him temptation (at leaſt pretence) to deny. And if it be thus with men, who poſſibly may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have an intereſt, ſometimes a vanity to oblige: it muſt be much more ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, who cannot be in want of us, and therefore need not buy us: <hi>Our good,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>extends not to him,</hi> Pſal. xvi. 2. He has fundamental right in that little we are, which will ſtand good tho' it ſhould never be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated by greater benefits. With what an humble baſhfulneſs should we then ſue for any thing, who have no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to invite the leaſt donation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already ſo pre-engaged, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mortgage ſo much as ourſelves in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of any new favor? And ſurely, extravagant hopes do very ill befit people in this condition. We ſee the modeſty
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031170_0023_0FEB1372623F1318"/>
of good <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> tho' he was by a ſlanderous accuſation outed of half the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>David</hi> given him, yet upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection that he derived it all from his good pleaſure, diſputed not the ſentence, but cheerfully reſigned to the ſame diſpoſure, from which he received it, ſaying, <hi>Yea, let him take all,</hi> 2 Sam, xix. 30. A rare example, and fit for imitation, as being adapted to the preſent caſe, not only in that one circumſtance of his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all from the king, but alſo in that of the attainder of his blood: which he confeſſes in the former part of the 28th verſe, <hi>For all of my father's houſe were but dead men before my Lord.</hi> And alas! may we not ſay the very ſame? Was not our whole race tainted in our firſt parent? So that if God had not the primary title of vaſſalage, he would in our fall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that of confiſcation and eſcheat. And can we think ourſelves then in terms to capitulate, and make our own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and expect God ſhould humour us in all our wild demands?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is indeed to keep up that old rebellion of our progenitor, for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in a diſcontent with that portion God had aſſigned him, and coveting what he had reſtrained him. Nay indeed it comes up to the height of the devil's propoſal,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031170_0024_0FEB1376561267E8"/>
the attempting <hi>to be as God,</hi> Gen. iii. 5. For 'tis an endeavor to wreſt the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of his hands, to ſupercede his authority of diſpenſing to us, and to carve for ourſelves. This is ſo mad an inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that were it poſible to ſtate a caſe exactly parallel between man and man, it would raiſe the indignation of any that but pretended to ingenuity. Yet this is, without hyperbole, the true meaning of every murmuring repining thought we entertain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But as bad as it is, who is there of us, that can in this particular ſay, <hi>We have made our hearts clean?</hi> Prov. xx. 9. 'Tis true we make ſome formal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment ſometimes that we receive all from God's gift: Cuſtom teaches us from our infancy, after every meal we eat, to give him thanks (though even that is now thought too much reſpect, and begins to be diſcarded as unfaſhionable:) yet ſure he cannot be thought to do that in earneſt, that has all the time of his eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been grumbling that his table abounds not with ſuch delicacies as his neigbors. And yet at this rate God knows are moſt of our thanſkgivings. Indeed we have not ſo much ordinary civility to God, as we have to men. The common proverb
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031170_0025_0FEB1377F8DBF050"/>
teaches us, not to pry too curiouſly into the blemiſhes of what is given us; but on God's gifts we fit as cenſors, nicely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine every thing which is in any way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to our fancies, and as if we dealt with him under the notion of chapmen, diſparage it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, buyers uſe to do, <hi>It is naught, it is naught ſaith the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> Prov. xx. 14. Nay we ſeem yet more abſurdly to change the ſcene, and as if God were to make oblations to us, we as critically obſerve the detects of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, as the Levitical prieſts were to do thoſe of the ſacrifice, and (like angry Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) ſcornfully reject, whatever does not perfectly anſwer our wanton appetites.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And now, ſhould God take us at our words, withdraw all thoſe bleſſings which we ſo faſtidiouſly deſpiſe, what a condition were we in? Tis ſure we have nothing to plead in reverſe of that Judgment. There is nothing in it againſt juſtice; for he takes but his own. This he intimates to Iſreal, Hoſ. ii. 9. <hi>I will return and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax;</hi> In which he aſſerts his own property, <hi>My corn, my wine,</hi> &amp;c. and recalls them to the remembrance that they were but uſufructuaries. And 'tis as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that our tenure is but the same. Nay this proceeding would not be repugnant
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031170_0026_0FEB137AC6CE0508"/>
even to mercy, for even that is not obliged ſtill to proſtitute itſelf to our contempt. I am ſure ſuch a toleration is beyond all the meaſures of human lenity. Should any of us offer an alms to an indigent wretch, and he when he ſees 'tis ſilver, ſhould murmur and exclaim that it is not gold, would we not draw back our hand, and reſerve our charity for a more worthy object? 'Tis true indeed, God's thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor our narrow bowels equal meaſures for the devine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and we experimentally find that his long-ſuffering infinitely exceeds ours; yet we know he does in the parable of the lord and the ſervant, <hi>Matt. xxviii.</hi> declare, that he will proportion his mercy by ours, in that inſtance; and we have no promiſe that he will not do it in this; nay we have all reaſon to expect he ſhould: For ſince his wiſdom prompts him to do nothing in vain, and all his bounty to us is deſigned to make us happy, when he ſees that end utterly fruſtrated by our diſcontents, to what purpoſe ſhould he continue that to which we will be never the better for?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Beſides tho' he be exceedingly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, yet he is not negligent or inſenſible; he takes particular notice, not only with what diligence we employ, but with what affections we reſent every of his bleſſings.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031170_0027_0FEB137D9549A948"/>
And as ingratitude is a voice odious to man ſo it is extremely provoking to God; ſo that in this ſenſe alſo, the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour are moſt true, <hi>From him that hath not (i. e.)</hi> that hath not a grateful ſenſe and value, <hi>ſhall be taken away even that he hath</hi> Mat. xxv. 29. But we may find a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this kind, more expreſs to Iſreal. <hi>Becauſe thou ſervedſt not the Lord thy God with gladneſs, and with joyfulneſs of heart, for the abundance of all things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall thou ſerve thine enemies, whom the Lord God will ſend among thee, in hunger, and in thirſt, and in nakedneſs, and in want of all things,</hi> Deut. xxviii. 27. A ſad and diſmal inverſion, yet founded wholly in the want of that cheerful recognition which God expected from them. And if Iſrael, the lot of his inheritance, that people whom he had ſingled out from all the nations of the world, could thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his favor by unthankfulneſs, ſure none of us can ſuppoſe we have any ſurer entail of it. In a word, as God loves a cheerful giver, ſo he alſo loves a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful receiver; one that complies with his end in beſtowing, by taking a juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence in his gifts. But the querulous and unſatisfied, reproach his bounty; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. If therefore ingenuity and gratitude cannot, yet at leaſt let prudence and ſelf-love engage us againſt this ſin of <hi>Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which we ſee does abundantly juſtify the character the wiſe man gives, when he tells us, '<hi>tis unprofitable,</hi> Wiſd. i. 11, he might have ſaid pernicious alſo; for ſo it evidently is in it's effects. Let us then arm ourſelves againſt it, and to that purpoſe impreſs deeply upon our minds the preſent conſideration. That God owes us nothing, and that whatever we receive is an alms, and not a tribute. <hi>Diogenes</hi> being aſked what wine drank the moſt pleaſant, anſwered, That which is drank at another's coſt. And this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance we can never miſs of to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend our good things to us: For be they little or much, they come <hi>gratis.</hi> When therefore in a pettiſh mood we find ourſelves apt to charge God fooliſhly, and to think him ſtrait-handed towards us, let us imagine we hear God expoſtulating with us, as the houſholder in the parable, <hi>

Every man is ready to ſay how ill beggary and pride do agree. The firſt qualification we cannot put off. O let us not provide it of the other ſo inconvenient, ſo odious an adjunct. Let us leave off preſcribing to God (which no ingenious man would do to an earthly benefactor) and ſet us betake ourſelves to a more holy and ſucceſsful policy, the acknowledgment of paſt mercies, and our own unworthineſs. This was <hi>Jacob's</hi> method, <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: for with my ſtaff I paſſed over this Jordan and now I am become two bands;</hi> and with this humble preface he introduces his petition for reſcue in his preſent diſtreſs, <hi>Deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. xxx. 10, 11. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent pattern of divine rhetoric, which the ſucceſs demonſtrates to have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prevalent. And we cannot tranſcribe better copy, to render our deſires as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. Indeed we are ſo utterly deſtitute of all arguments from ourſelves, that we
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031170_0030_0FEB138611034538"/>
can make no reaſonable form of addreſs, if we found it not in ſomething of God; and there is nothing even in him adapted to our purpoſe, but his mercy: nor can that be ſo advantageouſly urged by any thing, as by the former inſtances it has given of itſelf: for as God only is fit to be a precedent to himſelf, ſo he loves to be ſo. Thus we find, not only <hi>Moſes,</hi> but God often recollecting his miraculous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors towards <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as an argument to do more: Let us therefore accoſt him in his own way, and by a frequent and grateful recounting of his former mercies, engage him to future.

               <p>IT is the kown character of an unworthy nature, to write injuries in marble, and benefits in duſt; and however ſome (as Senaca well obſerves) may acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this imputation as to man, yet ſcarce any do ſo in relation to God. 'Tis true indeed the charge muſt be a little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; for God neither will nor can do us injury: Yet we receive any thing that is adverſe with ſuch a reſentment as if it were, and engrave that in our memories with indelible characters, whilſt his great and real benefits are either not at all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, or with ſo tranſient an advertence, that the compariſon of duſt is beyond our pitch, and we may be more properly ſaid to write them in water. Nay ſo far are we from keeping records and regiſters of his favors, that even thoſe ſtanding and fit ones which ſenſe can prompt us to, (without the aid of our memories) cannot obtain our notice.</p>

That very breath where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they utter their complaints, is a bleſſing, and a fundamental one too: for, if God ſhould withdraw that, they were incapable of whatſoever elſe they either have, or deſire. 'Tis true that ſome men's impatience hath riſen ſo high, as to caſt away life, becauſe it was not cloathed with all the circumſtances, they wiſhed. Yet theſe are rare inſtances, and do only ſhew ſuch men's depraved judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of things. A rich jewel is not the leſs valuable, becauſe a mad man in his raving ſit flings it into the fire: But as to the generality of men, the Devil (though a liar) gave a true account of their ſenſe, when he ſaid, <hi>Skin for ſkin, and that a man hath, will he give for his life,</hi> Job. II. 4. And though perhaps in an angry fit many men have with Jonas, Chap. iv. 3. <hi>wiſhed to die,</hi> yet ten to one, ſhould death then come, they would be as willing to divert it, as was the man in the Apologue, who wearied with his burden of ſticks, flung it down and called for death; but when he came, owned no other occaſion for him, but to be helped up again with his bundle. I dare in this appeal to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031170_0033_0FEB138EB9B6C7C0"/>
of thoſe, who have ſeemed very weary of life, whether when any ſudden danger has ſurpriſed them, it has not as ſuddenly altered their mind, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and made them have a greater deſire for life, than before they abhorred it. 'Tis the common ſaying, as long as there is life there is hope: it is ſo, as to ſecular concerns, for what ſtrange revolutions do we often ſee in the age of man? From what deſpicable beginnings have many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the moſt ſplendid conditions? Of which we have divers modern as well as ancient inſtances.</p>
               <p>Indeed 'tis admirable to ſee what time &amp;c. induſtry will (with God's bleſſing) effect. <hi>But there is no work, nor device, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor wiſdom in the grave,</hi> EC. ix. 10. we can improve no more when we are once tranſplanted thither.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But this is yet much more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in reſpect of our ſpiritual ſtate. Our life is the <hi>day wherein we are to work,</hi> John ix. (yea to work out Salvation:) but <hi>when the night comes</hi> (when death over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes) <hi>no man can work.</hi> Now alas when it is conſidered how much of this day the moſt of us have ſtood idle till the ſixth or ninth hour, it will be our concern not to have our day cloſe before the eleventh.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031170_0034_0FEB1391D269DA18"/>
Nay alas it is yet worſe with us: We have not only been idle, but very often ill buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: ſo that we have a great part of our time to unravel, and that is not to be done in a moment. For though our works may fitly enough be repreſented by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's compariſon of a <hi>ſpider's web,</hi> Iſa. lix. 5. yet they want the beſt property e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of that; they cannot be ſo ſoon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Vices that are radicated by time and cuſtom, lie too deep to be lightly ſwept away. It is no eaſy thing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade ourſelves to the will of parting with them. Many violences we muſt offer to ourſelves, a long and ſtrict courſe of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification muſt be gone through, e'er we can find in our hearts to bid them begone: And yet when we do ſo, they are not ſo tractible us the Centurions ſervants. They will indeed come when ever we bid them, but they will ſcarce go ſo: they muſt be expelled by force and by ſlow degrees; we muſt ſight for every inch of ground we gain from them: And as God would not aſſiſt the Iſraelites to ſubdue the Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites at once, Deut. vii. 22. ſo neither ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily does he, us to maſter perfectly our corruptions. Now a proceſs of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is not to be diſpatched on a ſudden.

And now I would deſire the Reader ſeriouſly to conſider, whether he can upon good grounds tell himſelf that this ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, (and yet ſo neceſſary) a work is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually wrought in him. If it be, he is a happy man, and can with no pretence complain of any external want: (he that is fed with Manna, muſt be ſtrangely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe if he murmur for a belly-full of <hi>leeks and onions,</hi> Num. xi. 15.) But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he owes infinite thanks to God, that has ſpared him time for this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant buſineſs, and did not put a period to his natural life, before he had begun a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. For I fear there are among the beſt of us few of ſo entire an innocence, but they may remember ſome, either ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits or acts of fin, in which it would have been dreadful for them to have been ſnatched away. And then how compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive, how prolific a mercy has life been to them, when it has carried eternity in its womb, and their continuance on earth has qualified them for heaven? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are ſuch perſons only to look on it as
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031170_0036_0FEB1397974590B8"/>
a bleſſing in the retroſpect, as it relates to the paſt, but alſo in the preſent and future; which if they continue to employ well, does not only confirm, but advance their reward. Beſides God may pleaſe by them to glorify himſelf, make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to his ſervice; which as it is the greateſt honor, ſo it is alſo the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſatisfaction to a good heart. He ſhews himſelf too mercenary that ſo longs for his reward, as to grow impatient of his attendance: He that loves God, thinks himſelf bleſt in the opportunity of doing work, as well as in receiving wages. Thus we ſee how life is under all theſe aſpects, a mercy to a pious man, and ſuch as not only obliges him to contentment, but gratitude.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But ſuppoſing a man cannot give this comfortable account of his life, but is conſcious that he has ſpent it to a very different purpoſe, yet does not that at all leſſen his obligations to God, who meant he ſhould have employed it better, and that he has not done ſo is merely his own fault. Nay indeed the worſe his ſtate is, the greater mercy it is, that God has not made it irreverſible, that he has not cut him off at once from the earth, and the poſſibility of Heaven too, but affords him

This long-ſuffering is one of the moſt tranſcendant acts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs, and therefore the Apoſtle rightly ſtiles it the <hi>the riches of his goodneſs, and long ſuffering, and forbearance,</hi> Rom. ii. 4. And ſo at laſt we commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, when we have worn it out, and can no longer receive advantage by it. What a value does a gaſping deſpairing ſoul put upon a ſmall parcel of that time, which before he knew not how faſt enough to ſquander? Oh that men would ſet the ſame eſtimate on it before: and then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as it would make them better huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands of it, ſo it would alſo render them more thankful for it, <hi>Accounting that the long-ſuffering of our Lord is ſalvation,</hi> 2. Pet. iii. 15.</p>

Indeed did men but rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the benefit of life upon this ſcore, all ſecular encumbrances and uneaſineſſes of it would be overwhelmed, and ſtand only as cyphers in the account. What a ſhame is it then that we ſhould ſpend our breath in ſighs and out-cries? which if we would employ to thoſe nobler ends for which it was given, would ſuperſede our complaints, and make us confeſs we were well dealt with: that on <hi>life</hi> (though bare and ſtripped of all outward acceſſaries) <hi>is

And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he that has yet the great work of life to do, can very ill ſpare time or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to beſtow upon the regretting any temporal diſtreſs, ſince his whole ſtock is little enough to bewail and repair his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of his eternal concerns. Were our lives therefore deſtitute of all outward comfort, nay were they nothing but a ſcene of perpetual diſaſters, yet this one advantage of life would infinitely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh them all, and render our murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very inexcuſable.</p>

But God has not put this to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt trial, has never placed any man in ſuch a ſtate of unmixed calamity, but that he ſtill affords many and great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts: he finds it fit ſometimes to diminiſh ſome of our outward comforts, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps imbitter others, but he never takes all way. This muſt be acknowledged, it we do but conſider how many things there are in which the whole race of mankind do in common partake. The four ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, fire and water, air and earth, do not more make up every man's compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſupply his needs: the whole hoſt of heaven, the ſun, moon, and ſtars, <hi>Moſes,</hi> will tell us, are by <hi>God divided to all nations under the whole heaven,</hi> Deut. iv. 19. Thoſe reſplendent bodies,

equally afford their light and influence to all. The ſun ſhines as bright on the poor cottage, as on the moſt magnificent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; and the ſtars have their benign aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, as well for <hi>him that is behind the mill,</hi> as for <hi>him that ſitteth on the throne,</hi> Exod. xi. 5. Property (the great incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary below) breeds no confuſion in thoſe celeſtial orbs, but they are every man's treaſure, yet no man's peculiar, (as if they meant to teach us, that our love of appropriation <hi>deſcends not from above,</hi> James iii. 15, is no heavenly quality.)</p>

And this indeed ſeems that moſt forlorn ſtate of poverty; yet God has provided for them alſo, by aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch perſons to the care of the rich: Nay, he has put an extraordinary mark of favour on them, given them the honour of being his proxies repreſentatives, made them letters of attorney (as it were) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand relief in his name, and upon his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. And though tis too true, that even that authority will not prevail with many of the rich to open their purſes, yet even in this age of frozen charity, there are ſtill ſome who remember upon what terms they received their wealth, and employ it accordingly.

               <head>Of the Surpluſage of our Enjoyments above our Sufferings.</head>
               <p>TO regulate our eſtimate of thoſe things which we either enjoy or ſuffer, there are three precedent queries to be made: The firſt of their number of plenty, the ſecond of their weight, the third of their conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and continuance; for according as they partake more of theſe properties, every good is more good, and every evil is more evil. It will therefore be our beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of trial in the preſent caſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our bleſſings and our calamities in theſe three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And firſt in part of plenty, the mercies of God are the ſource of all our good, are ſet out to us in holy ſcripture in the moſt ſupurlative ſtrain. They are <hi>multitude,</hi> Pſal. cii. 20. <hi>Plentious redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> Pſal. cxxx. 7. <hi>As high as the heaven,</hi> Pſal. ciii. 11. <hi>He fills all things living with plenteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. cxlv. 16.

We are like a vaſt build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which coſts as much to maintain as to erect. And indeed conſidering the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibleneſs of our materials, our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is no leſs a work of omnipotence, than our firſt forming: Nay perhaps it is rather a greater. Our original clay though it had no aptneſs, yet it had no averſion to the receiving a human form; but was in the hand of the potter to make it what he pleaſed: But we now have principles of decay within us, which vehemently tend to diſſolution; we want the ſupplies of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things without us, the failing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

return us again to our duſt. Nay we do not only need the aid, but we fear the hoſtility of outward things. That every air which ſometimes refreſhes us, may at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtarve &amp; freeze us; that which warms and comforts, has alſo a power of conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us. Yea that very meat which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, may choak and ſtiflle us. In a word, there is no creature ſo deſpicable, ſo inconſiderable, which may not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſerve, and which may not at any time (if God permit) ruin us. Now, whence is it that we ſo conſtantly, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently find the good, the benign effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theſe things, and ſo ſeldom, ſo rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the evil? Whence I ſay is it, but from the active unwearied providence, which draws forth the better properties of the creatures for our uſe, and reſtrains the worſer for our ſecurity? which with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advertence watches not only over e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon, but every ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of that perſon. And how aſtoniſhing a contemplation is this? If the mere eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing of the ſea, put the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher into ſuch an ecſtacy, that he flung himſelf into it, becauſe he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the inſcrutable cauſe of it; in what perpetual raptures of admiration may we be, who have every minute within us, and about us more and greater wonders, and thoſe too in our favor,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031170_0060_0FEEDE7CBB14F448"/>
when we deſerve rather the divine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould exert itſelf into our deſtruction?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But alas! our danger from the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, is little compared with thoſe from the ſpirits of darkneſs. <hi>We wreſtle not only with fleſh and blood, but with prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, with ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. Epheſ. vi. 12. So inveterate is the enmity between the ſerpent and the ſeed of the woman in general, that he watches all advantages againſt us, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our ſouls, but even our bodies, our goods, and in every part of our concerns. Thus we ſee he not only aſſaulted <hi>Job's</hi> ſoul, by the wicked inſinuations of his wiſe, (with more effect) his body with boils and ſores, his poſſeſſions by the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans</hi> and <hi>Sabeans,</hi> and the images of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his deareſt children, by a wind from the wilderneſs, Job i. And can we think his malice is now worm out? No ſurely, he ſtill wiſhes as ill to mankind as ever, and we ſhould ſoon ſee the woful effects of it, did not the ſame power which let looſe for <hi>Job's</hi> trial, reſtrain him for our ſafety. Nay, had he but power to affright, though not to hurt us, even that would make our lives very uncomfortable. We cannot hear the relation of ſprights or apparitions, but our blood chills upon it,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031170_0061_0FEEDE7E54144240"/>
and a horror runs through our reins: What ſhould we then do if he ſhould make his night-walks through our chamber, and with his illuſory terrors diſturb our reſt? Yet all this and much more he would do, if God did not chain up this <hi>old dragon,</hi> Rev. xx. Nay, if he were not at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a guard about us, and thoſe no leſs than angels. I ſhall not diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every perſon hath not his peculiar guardian: For though many have not improbably aſſerted it. we have ground enough of acquieſcence in the general af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Apoſtle. <hi>That they are all miniſtering ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them, who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation,</hi> Heb. i. 14. And now if the reader pleaſe to ſum up how many are his concerns, and how many are the dangers await him in them all, he cannot ſure render the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of thoſe mercies which preſerve the one, and divert the other, in any other phraſe tahn that of the pſalmiſt, <hi>They are more than I am able to expreſs,</hi> Pſal. xi. 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We may now challenge the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable or the moſt querelous man living, to produce cauſes of complaint, proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to thoſe of thanſgiving. He that has the greateſt ſtock of calamities, can never vie with the heaps of benefits; the diſproportion is greater than that of the

We may judge by ourſelves which he is likelieſt often to repeat, thoſe acts which he doth with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and reluctancy, or thoſe which he does with pleaſure and delight. But we need no inferences where we have the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of experience. Let every man therefore make this his judge in this caſe, let him every night recollect, how many things within and about him he is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, and conſider how many of thoſe have been preſerved entire to him, ſtill accounting every thing ſo continued as a new donation. If he begin with his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſtate, 'tis too poſſible he may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times find he has loſt his innocence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome, perhaps many ſins: But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in theſe he will find cauſe to juſtify God, If he do but recollect with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward checks and admonitions, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſtraints, God has endeavored to bridle him. If he will break through thoſe fences, that does not at all derogate from the mercy of God which ſo guarded him, but it rather illuſtrates his goodneſs, that after ſo many quenchings of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031170_0063_0FEEDE85A5381380"/>
does yet continue its influence. So that even he that has the moſt deplorably violated his integrity, is yet to confeſs that God's purpoſe was to have preſerved it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; and he might really ſo have kept it, had he complied with thoſe aids which were afforded him. But in temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns we are not ſo apt to undermine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and therefore ſhall much more rarely find we have ſuffered detriment in them, that in our ſpiritual; but are there ordinarily like to meet with a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Let a man therefore conſider what is lacking to him of all the ſecular good things he had in the morning, and tell me whether for the moſt part he may not give ſuch an account, as the Iſraelitiſh of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers did of their men, after the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Midinnites, That he hath not loſt one,</hi> Numb. xxxi. 39. Or if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he do ſuffer a diminution, yet at the worſt he will find that many more good things have been preſerved to him, than have been taken from him. A man may perhaps meet with ſome damage in his eſtate, yet 'tis manifold odds that that damage in but partial, and that he has ſtill more left than is loſt. Or if it be more entire, yet if he have his health, his limbs, his ſenſes, his friends, and all things beſide his eſtate left him, ſo that for one thing he has loſt, he ſtill retains

a multitude, he may ſay of it as the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the few loaves, <hi>What is this among ſo many,</hi> Matth. xiv. 17. <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> being bemoaned for the loſe of a farm, replied with ſome ſharpneſs upon his condoler, You have but one field, and I have yet three left, why ſhould I not rather grieve for you? Intimating that a man is not ſo much to eſtimate what ha has loſt, as what he has left. A piece of wiſdom which if he would tranſcribe, we might quickly convince ourſelves, that even in our moſt adverſe eſtate there are as <hi>Elijah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>More with us than againſt us,</hi> 2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. And as they do out-number, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo do they outweigh them. The mercies we receive from God are (as the laſt ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ſhewed) of the greateſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the moſt ſubſtantial ſolid goods; and the greateſt of all, I mean thoſe which concern our eternal ſtate, are ſo firmly fixed on us, that unleſs we will voluntarily quit our claim, 'tis not in the power of men or devils to defeat us.

from any temporal wants who have the entail of an eternal inheritance. But ſurely <hi>God does not leave himſelf without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Acts xiv. 17. even in ſecular things; there is no man breathing but has ſome bleſſings of his left hand, as well as his right, as I have already mentioned: and unleſs it be ſome few prodigies of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in whoſe puniſhment or patience God deſigns ſignally to glorify himſelf, there are none who enjoy not greater comforts of life than thoſe they want, I mean ſuch as are really greater, though perhaps, to their prejudicate fancies they do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo. Thus in point of health, if a man be diſaffected in one part, yet all the reſt of his body may be (and often is) well; or if he have a complication, and have more than one diſeaſe, yet there is no man that has all, or half ſo many as are incident to human bodies, ſo that he is comparatively more healthy than ſick. So again it is not very common for a man to loſe a limb, or ſenſe; the generality of them keep them to their laſt; and they who do, have in that an overbalance to moſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adverſities; and even they who are ſo unhappy to loſt one, yet commonly keep the reſt, at leaſt the major part: or if at any time any man is left a mere breathing trunk, yet it is by ſuch ſtupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſes as deaden the ſenſes, or ſuch mortal ones as ſoon take them away; and
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031170_0067_0FEEDE9141D786F0"/>
ſo the remedy overtakes the malady. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it pleaſes God very often to make compenſation for the want of one member or faculty by improving the uſe of another. We have ſeen feel ſupply all the neceſſary uſes of hands, to thoſe that have had none; and it is a thing of daily obſervation that men that are blind, have their intellects more vigorous and active, by their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions from viſible objects.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Thus alſo it is in the matter of wealth; he that is forced to get his bread by the ſweat of his brows, 'tis true he cannot have thoſe delicacies wherewith rich men abound, yet his labor helps him to a more poignant, more ſavoury ſauce than a whole college of epicures can compound. His hunger gives a higher guſt to his dry cruſt, than the ſurfeited ſtomach can find in the moſt coſtly, moſt elaborate mixture; So verifying the obſervation of <hi>Solomon, The full ſoul loatheth the honey-comb, but to the hungry ſoul every bitter thing is ſweet,</hi> Prov. xxvii. 7. He cannot <hi>indeed ſtretch himſelf upon his bed of ivory,</hi> Amos vi. 4. yet his ſleeps are founder than thoſe that can.

To conclude, he has one advantage beyond all theſe; his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities reſcue him from idleneſs, and all its conſequent temptations; which is ſo great a benefit, that if rich men be not their own taſk-maſters, as his wants are his, if they do not provide themſelves of buſineſs, that one want of theirs is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more deplorable than all his; and he is not only happy comparatively with himſelf, in having better things than he wants, but with them alſo.</p>

If we come now to reputation and ſame, the account will be much the ſame, he that is eminent in the world for ſome great achievement, is ſet up as an object of every man's remark; when as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies on one hand are viſible, ſo his faults and blemiſhes are on the other. And as human frailty makes it too proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, theſe latter will be really more, ſo hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man envy makes it ſure that they ſhall be more preciſely, more curiouſly obſerved, and more loudly blazoned.

the whole, a good quiet ſecurity, tho' it be not the road to glory, yet is the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt fence againſt infamy. And indeed, he that can keep up the repute of a ſober integrity within his own private ſphere, need not envy the triumphant ſallies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which often meet with a fatal turn at the latter end of the day. But it will be ſaid that even that more moderate ſort of reputation is not every man's portion, but that many lie under great ignominy and ſcandal. I ſhall here aſk whether theſe be juſt or unjuſt? If they be juſt they belong not to our preſent ſubject, which relates only to thoſe inflictions which are the effects of God's immediate providence, not of our own crimes: For I never doubted but that by thoſe we may diveſt ourſelves of any, nay of all the good things God has deſigned us. But if the obloquy be unjuſt, 'tis probable that 'tis taken up only by ill men, and that the good paſs a more equitable ſentence; and then ſurely the atteſtation of a few ſuch, is able to outweigh a multitude of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And in this caſe a man may only find patience but pleaſure in reproaches. <hi>Socrates</hi> looked with trouble and jealouſy on himſelf when ill men commended him. ſaying, what ill have I done? and ſure a Chriſtian has a farther reaſon to be pleaſed with their revilings, they being

But ſometimes it happens, that even good men are ſeduced and either by the artifices of the wicked, or their own too haſty credulity, give credit to unjuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. And this I confeſs is a ſharp trial to the injured perſon, yet even this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not often be univerſal; there can ſcarce be any innocence ſo forlorn but that there may be opportunities of clearing it to ſome or other, and by them propagating it to more, and if the cloud ever come to be diſperſed, their ſame will appear with the brighter luſtre. But if none of this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, they have yet a certain and more bleſſed retreat, even an appeal to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Judge, who never beholds us with more approbation, that when we are under the unjuſt condemnation of men. Indeed we have then a double tie upon him, not only his juſtice but his pity is concerned in our cauſe.

               <p>I have now inſtanced in the three moſt general concerns of human life, the body, goods, and fame, to which heads may be reduced moſt of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions incident to our outward ſtate, as far as immediately concern ourſelves. But their is no man ſtands ſo ſingle in the world, but has ſome relations or friends, in which he thinks himſelf interereſted, and many times thoſe oblique ſtrokes which wound us through them, are as painful as the more direct; yet here alſo God is ordinarily pleaſed to provide ſome allays, if we would but take notice of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031170_0072_0FEEDED907482E78"/>
them. He who has had one friend die, has ordinarily divers others ſurviving; or if he have not that, uſually God raiſes him up others. 'Tis true we cannot have a ſucceſſion of fathers and mothers, yet we often have of other friends that are no leſs helpful to us: And indeed there are ſcarce in any thing more remarkable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Providence, than in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. <hi>He that is able out of ſtones to raiſe up children to Abraham,</hi> Matth. iii. 9. does many times by as unexpected a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction ſupply friends to the deſolate. But we do ſometimes loſe our friends while they are living, they withdraw their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is the ſoul of friendſhip: And if this happen by our own demerit, we can accuſe neither God nor them for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor can we rationally expect that God will provide ſupplies, when we wilfully deſpoil ourſelves. But when they are unkind without provocation, then is the ſeaſon for his interpoſition, who uſes to take up <hi>thoſe whom father and mother forſake,</hi> Pſal. xxvii. 10. And we frequently ſee ſignal proofs of his care in exciting the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of other friends and relatives, or perhaps of mere ſtrangers. Nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God makes the inhumanity of a man's relations, the occaſion of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Thus the barbarous malice of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031170_0073_0FEEDEA05F48CA00"/>
Joſeph's brethren was the fiſt ſtep to his dominion over Egypt. And it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obſervation in families, that the moſt diſcountenanced child oft makes better proof, than the darling.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We are yet liable to a third afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the calamity of our friends, which by the ſympathy of kindneſs preſſes us no leſs (perhaps more) ſenſibly than our own: But then it is to be conſidered, that theirs are capable of the ſame allaying circumſtances that ours are, and God has the ſame arts of alleviating their burdens; ſo that we have the ſame arguments for acquieſcence in their ſufferings that we have in our own, and ſhall do a more friendly office in impreſſing thoſe upon them, than in the moſt paſſionate adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſorrows.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The laſt and greateſt diſcomfort from friends, is that of that of their own: And if ever we may be allowed that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate ſtrain of the Prophet, Iſa. xxii. 4. <hi>Look away from me, I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me;</hi> this ſeems to be the time: Yet even this <hi>valley of Achor is not without a door of hope,</hi> Hoſ. ii. 15. A vicious perſon may be recalled, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes have been; ſo that as long as God continues life, we ought no more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031170_0074_0FEEDEA1F1FBC6C0"/>
our hope than to quit our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Beſides there are few that make this complaint that have not ſomething to balance, or at leaſt to lighten it. I ſhall inſtance in that relation which is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt tender, that of a parent. He that has one bad child may have divers good. If he have but one virtuous it is a very great mercy, and it is another that he may be the better taught to value it by the oppoſition of the contrary. But if any be ſo unhappy as to have many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and <hi>all to conſume his eyes and grieve his heart.</hi> 2 Sam. ii. 33. it may be a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable reflection for him to examine how far he has contributed to it, either by <hi>Eli's</hi> fond indulgence, or by a remiſs and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs education; or which is worſt of all, by his moſt impious example. If any, or all of thoſe be found the cauſe, he is not ſo much to ſeek for allays to his grief, as for pardon of his ſin: And when he has penitently retracted his own fault, he may then have better ground of hope that God may reform thoſe of his children. In the mean time he may look on his own afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them as God's diſcipline on him, and gather at leaſt this comfort from it, that his heavenly Father has more care of him, than he had of his, and does not leave him uncorrected.</p>

12. Thus we ſee in all the concerns (which are the moſt common and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of human life, and wherein the juſteſt of our complaints are uſually founded) there is ſuch a temperature and mixture, that the good does more than equal the ill, and not only in the groſſer bulk, when our whole ſtate is weighed together, but in every ſingle branch of it; God having herein dealt with this little world man, as he has done with the greater, wherein he is obſerved to have furniſhed every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with ſpecific remedies for their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar diſeaſes. I have only given theſe ſhort hints by way of eſſay and pattern for the Reader's contemplation, which when he ſhall have extended to all thoſe minute particulars wherein he is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerned, more curiouſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his ſufferings with his allays and comforts, I cannot doubt but he will own himſelf an inſtance of the truth of the preſent theſis, and confeſs, that he has much more cauſe of thankfulneſs than complaint.</p>
               <p n="13">13. This I ſay, ſuppoſing his afflictions to be of thoſe more ſolid and conſiderable ſorts I have before mentioned. But how many are there who have few or none of ſuch, who ſeem to be ſeated in the land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> in a place exempt from all the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031170_0076_0FEEDEA7E6951340"/>
plagues that infect their neighbours? And thoſe, one would think, ſhould give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vote to this concluſion, as having no temptation to reſiſt it; yet I doubt it is far otherwiſe, that ſuch men are of all the moſt unſatisfied. For though they have no croſſes of God's impoſing, they uſually create a multitude to themſelves. And here we may ſay with <hi>David, It is better to full into the hand of God, than into the hand of man.</hi> 2 Sam. xxiv. 14. It is eaſier to bear the afflictions God ſends, than thoſe we make to ourſelves. His are limited both for quantity and quality, but our own are as boundleſs as thoſe extravagant deſires from which they ſpring.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And this is the true cauſe why Contentment is ſo much a ſtranger to thoſe who have all the outward cauſes of it, they have not definite meaſure of their deſires; it is not the ſupply of all their real wants will ſerve their turn, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites are precarious, and depend upon contingencies. They hunger not becauſe they are empty, but becauſe others are full. Many a man could have liked his own portion well enough, had he not ſeen another have ſomething he liked better. Nay even the moſt inconſiderable things
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031170_0077_0FEEDEA9819FC580"/>
acquire a value by being anothers, when we deſpiſe much greater of our own. <hi>Ahab</hi> might well have ſatisfied himſelf with the kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had not <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both's</hi> poor plot lain in his eye. But ſo raving were his deſires after it, that he diſreliſhes all the pomps of a crown, yea the ordinary refreſhment of nature, <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="15">15. Nor are our appetites only excited thus by our outward objects, but precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and hurried on by our inward luſts. The proud man ſo longs for homage and adoration, that nothing can pleaſe him if that be wanting. <hi>Human</hi> can find no guſt in all the ſenſualities of the <hi>Perſian</hi> court, becauſe a poor deſpicable <hi>Jew</hi> denies his obeiſance, Eſth. v. 13. The luſtful ſo impatiently purſues his impure deſigns, that any difficulty he meets in them, makes him pine and languiſh like <hi>Amnon,</hi> who could no way recover his own health

The revengeful labours under an hydropic thirſt till he have the blood of his enemy: All the liquor of <hi>Abſalom's</hi> ſheep-ſheering could not quench his, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſlaughter of his brother, 2 Sam. xiii. 29. And thus every one of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions keeps us upon the rack till they have obtained their deſigns. Nay when they have, the very emptineſs of thoſe acquiſitions is a new torment, and puts us upon freſh purſuits. Thus between the impetuouſneſs of our deſires, and the emptineſs of our enjoyments, we ſtill <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ourſelves in vain,</hi> Pſal. xxxix. 6. And whilſt we have ſuch cruel taſk-maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it is not ſtrange to find us groaning under our burdens. If we will indulge all our vicious or fooliſh appetites, think our lives bound up with them, and ſolicit the ſatisfaction of them with as impatient a vehemence, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did for children, Gen, xxx. 4. <hi>Give me them or I die;</hi> no wonder that we are always complaining of diſappointments, ſince in theſe the very ſucceſs is a defeat, and is but the exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pain of a craving ravenous ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, for that of a cloyed and nauſeated. Indeed men of this temper condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a perpetual reſtleſsneſs, they are like phantaſtic mutineers, who when their ſuperiors ſend them blanks to write their
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031170_0078_0FEC8771742A2428"/>
own conditions, know not what will pleaſe them: And even Omnipotence itſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfy theſe till it have new moulded them, and reduced their deſires to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
               <p n="16">16. But in the mean time how unjuſtly do they accuſe God of illiberality, becauſe every thing anſwers not their humour? He has made them reaſonable creatures, and has provided them ſatisfactions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their nature; but if they will have wild irrational expectations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his wiſdom, nor his goodneſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to ſatisfy thoſe. His ſupplies are real and ſolid, and therefore have no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence to imaginary wants. If we will create ſuch to ourſelves, why do we not create an imaginary ſatisfaction to them? It were the merrier frenzy of the two, to be like the mad <hi>Athenian,</hi> that thought all the ſhips that came into the harbour his own: And it were better, <hi>Ixion</hi> like, to have our arms filled with a cloud, than to have them perpetually beating our own breaſts, and be ſtill tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ourſelves with inſatiable deſires. Yet this is the ſtate to which men volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſubject themſelves, and then quarrel at God becauſe they will not let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be happy. But ſure their very complaints juſtify God, and argue that
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031170_0080_0FEC877373F03808"/>
he has dealt very kindly with them, and afforded them all the neceſſary accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of life: For did they want them, they would not be ſo ſenſible of the want of the other. He that is at perfect eaſe may feel with ſome vexation the biting of flea or gnat, which would not be at all obſervable if he were upon the rack. And ſhould God change the ſcene, and make theſe nice people feel the deſtitution of neceſſaries; all theſe regrets about ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities would be overwhelmed. In the mean time how deplorable a thing is it, that we are ſtill the poorer for God's bounty, that those to whom he has open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand wideſt, ſhould open their mouth ſo too, in outcries and murmurs? For I think I may ſay, that generally, thoſe that are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But in our dealings with God, we put off even this common equity; are vaſt in our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but penurious and baſe in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns; and as if God were our ſteward not our Lord, we require of him with a confidence proper only to thoſe who aſk their own; whilſt in the interim, what we offer to him is with ſuch a diſdainful ſlightneſs, as if we meant it rather an alms than an homage.</p>

2. God indeed is ſo munificent, that he <hi>prevents us with his bleſſings,</hi> Pſal. xxi. 3. gives us many things before we aſk; had he not done ſo we could not have been ſo much as in a capacity of aſking.

God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly articled for the performance of his commands, and made all their enjoyments forfeitable upon the failure, as we may ſee at large in the book of Deuteronomy. And under the Goſpel, St. <hi>Paul</hi> appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates the <hi>promiſes as well of this life as of that to come unto godlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 8. It will therefore be a material inquiry for every man, whether he have kept his title entire, and have not by breach of the condition forfeited his claim even to the moſt common ordinary bleſſings; for if he have, common reaſon will tell him he can challenge none; and that the utmoſt he can hope for, muſt be only upon a new ſcore of unmerited favour.</p>

3. And here certainly <hi>every mouth muſt be ſtopped, and all the world become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> Rom. iii. 19. For alas! who is there can ſay his obedience has been in any degree proportionable to his obligation? It is manifeſt we have all received abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly from God's hand, but what has he had from ours? I may challenge the beſt man, to caſt up the account of his beſt day, and tell me whether his receivings have not infinitely exceeded his diſburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whether for any one good thing he has done, he has not received many. Nor is the diſparity only in number, but much more in value. God's works are perfect, all he does for us, like the firſt ſix days productions, <hi>all are very good,</hi> Gen. i. but alas! our very <hi>righteouſneſs is as filthy rags,</hi> Iſa. lxiv. 6. We offer <hi>him the blind and the lame,</hi> Mal. i. 8. a few yawning drowſy prayers perhaps, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has the leaſt ſhare; the fuller cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of our thoughts, running towards our ſecular or ſinful concerns. We drop it may be a ſcanty alms, wherein it is odds our vain-glory ſcrambles for a ſhare with him, if it do not wholly ingroſs it. We ſit an hour at a ſermon, but it is rather to hear the wit or eloquence of the preacher, than the word of God. Like the duller ſort of animals, we like well to have our itching ears ſcratched, but grow ſturdy
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031170_0091_0FEEDECAFA6A5880"/>
and reſtive when we ſhould do what we are there taught. In a word, all our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices at the beſt are miſerable, maimed and imperfect; and too often corrupt and unfound. So that God may well upbraid us as he did <hi>Iſrael, Offer it new to thy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, will he be pleaſed with it?</hi> Mal. i. 8. Theſe very iniquities of our holy things, are enough to defeat all our pretence to any good from God's hand. Yet God knows this is much the beſt ſide of us: It is not every one that can make ſo fair an appearance as this amounts to. With many, there is no place to complain of the blemiſhes of their ſacrifices, for they offer none; of whom we may ſay in the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>God is not in all their thoughts,</hi> Pſal. x. 4. I fear there want not thoſe who drive away the day, the week, nay the year, without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring in whoſe <hi>hand their time is,</hi> Pſal. xxxi. 16. or paying him any ſolemn tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of it; who enjoy the ſervices of all inferior creatures, without conſidering that theirs are more due to the ſupreme Lord: In a word, who live as if they were abſolutely independent; had their exiſtence purely from themſelves, and had no Creator to whom they owed their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any conſequent duty. And ſure men who thus diſcard themſelves from God's family, have very little reaſon to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031170_0090_0FEC87A6AB404FB8"/>
expect the proviſions of it: Yet even ſuch as theſe have the impudence to complain, if any things be wanting to their needs (ſhall I ſay) or to their luſts; can raving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profane God's name in their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiencies, which they know not how to uſe in their prayers; as if the Deity were conſiderable in no other notion, than that of their caterer or ſteward.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If now we ſeriouſly reflect, what can be more admirable than that infinite pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God, who notwithſtanding the miſerable infirmities of the pious, and the lewd contempt of the impious, ſtill goes on reſolutely in his bounty, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to all mankind ſome, and to ſome all his temporal bleſſings? He has no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſtice to do ſo, for it is no part of his compact; he has none of gratitude, for he is perpetually affronted and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged. Surely we may well ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Is this after the manner of men, O Lord,</hi> I Chron. xvii. 17. Can the higheſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man indulgence bear any proportion with this divine clemency? No certainly, no finite patience but would be exhauſted with the thouſandth part of our provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But is not our dealing too as little after the manner of men; I mean of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable

creatures? For us who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited our right to all, and yet by mere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour are ſtill kept in the poſſeſſion of many great bleſſings; for us to grow mutinous, becauſe there is perhaps ſomething more trifling which is denied us, is ſuch a ſtupid ingratitude, as one would think impoſſible to human nature. Should a tenant with us have at once forfeited his leaſe, and maliciouſly affronted his landlord, he would ſure think himſelf very gently dealt with, if he were ſuffered to enjoy but a part of his firſt eſtate; but we ſhould think him not only inſolent, but mad, who when the whole were left him, ſhould quarrel and clamour if he might not have his cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage adorned with marble floors, and gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed roofs. Yet at this wild rate we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have ourſelves to our great Landlord, grow pettiſh and angry if we have not every thing we can fancy, though we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy many more uſeful, merely by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. And can there be any thing imagined more unreaſonable? Let us therefore, if not for piety, yet at leaſt to juſtify our claim to rationality, be more ingenuous; let us not conſult only with our fond appetites, and be thus perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſoliciting this ſatisfaction; but rather reflect on what tenure we hold what we already have, even that of ſuperabundant mercy; and fear, leaſt like inſolent beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,

by the impudence of our demands, we divert even that charity which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned us. In ſhort, let every man, when he computes what he wants of his deſires, reckon as exactly how much he is ſhort of his duty; and when he has duly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered both, he will think it a very gentle compoſition to have the one unſupplied, ſo he may have the other remitted: and will ſee cauſe contentedly to ſit down and ſay with honeſt <hi>Mephiboſheth, What right have I to cry any more unto the king?</hi> 2 Sam. xix. 28. But if it be thus with us upon the mere ſcore of our imperfections or omiſſions, what an obnoxious ſtate do our innumerable actual ſins put us in? If the ſpots of our ſacrifices are provoking, what are our ſacrileges and bold profanations? If thoſe who neglect or forget God are liſted among his enemies, what are thoſe who avowedly defy him? Indeed he who ſoberly conſiders the world, and ſees how daringly the divine Majeſty is daily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, cannot but wonder that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions of our manners, thoſe prodigies in morality, ſhould not be anſwered with as great prodigies in calamity too; that we ſhould either have other ruin than that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or the earth ſerve us for any other purpoſe than to be, as it was to <hi>Korah,</hi> Numb. xvi. 32. our living ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</p>

6. Nor is this forbearance of God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable only towards the maſs and collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body of mankind, but to every man in particular. Who is there that if he ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack his conſcience, ſhall not find guilts enough to juſtify God in the utmoſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities towards him?

We have a great many ſuffering capacities, and if thoſe were all filled up to the height, our condition would ſcarce differ from that of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any thing but duration. But God is more merciful, and never inflicts at that rate on us here. Every man's experience can tell him, that God diſcharges not his whole quiver at once upon him, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts him in many more particulars than he afflicts him; and yet the ſame experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will probably tell moſt of us, that we are not ſo modeſt in our aſſaults upon God; we attack him in all his concerns (as far as our feeble malice can reach) in his ſovereignty, in his honour, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, nay ſometimes in his very eſſence and being. And as they are univerſal in reſpect of him, ſo alſo in regard of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: we engage all our powers in this war, do not only <hi>yield</hi> (as the Apoſtle

Nor are only the members of our body, but the faculties of our ſouls thus employed; our underſtandings are buſied firſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving ſins, and then excuſes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes for them; our wills are yet more ſturdy rebels, and when the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is beat out of all its out-works, yet ſullenly keep their hold in ſpite of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; and our affections madly ruſh on <hi>like the horſe into the battle,</hi> Jer. viii. 6. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred by nothing of danger, ſo there be but ſin enough in the attempt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And now with what face can people that thus purſue an hoſtility, expect that it ſhould not be returned to them? Does any man denounce war, and yet expect from his adverſary all the careſſes, the obligements of friendſhip? Self-defence will prompt even the meekeſt nature to deſpoil his enemy at leaſt of thoſe things which he uſes, to his annoyance; and if God ſhould give way even to that loweſt degree of anger, where or what were we? For ſince we employ our whole ſelves againſt him, nothing but deſtruction can avert our injuries. But 'tis happy for us we have to do with one who cannot fear

Were it not for this, we ſhould not be reſt in a poſſibility ſo oft to iterate our provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; every wicked imagination and black deſign, would be at once defeated and puniſhed by infatuation and frenzy: every blaſphemous atheiſtical ſpeech would wither the tongue, like that <hi>arm</hi> of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> which he ſtretched againſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, 1 Kings xiii. 4. and every impious act would, like the prohibited retroſpect of <hi>Let's</hi> wife, fix us perpetual monuments of divine vengeance.</p>

And then how much do we owe to the mercy and commiſeration of our God, that <hi>he ſuffers not his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe,</hi> Pſal. lxxviii. 38. that he abates any thing of that juſt ſeverity he might uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us?

But there is yet farther circumſtance to be advert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and is too applicable to many of us, that is, that out ſins are not only the conſtant meritorious cauſe of our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but they are alſo very often the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſe alſo; and produce them not only by way of retaliation from God, but by a natural efficacy. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, he that <hi>loves pleaſure. ſhall be a poor man,</hi> and that <hi>a whoriſh woman ſhall bring a man to a piece of bread,</hi> Prov. vi. 26. <hi>that he that ſits long at the wine, ſhall have redneſs of eyes,</hi> Chap. xxiii. 29, 30. <hi>that the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoul ſhall ſuffer hunger,</hi> Chap. xix. 15. and all theſe not by immediate ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral infliction from God, but as the proper genuine effects of thoſe reſpective vices. Indeed God in his original eſtabliſhment of things, has made ſo cloſe a connexion between ſin and puniſhment, that he is not often put to exert his power in any extraordinary way, but may truſt us to be our own beadles, our own <hi>backſlidings reprove us,</hi> Jer. ii. 19. <hi>and our iniquities are</hi> of themſelves enough to <hi>become our ruin.</hi>

               <head>Of God's general Providence.</head>
               <p>WHEN God made the univerſe, he intended not only to glorify himſelf in one tranſient act of his power, and then leave this great and wonderful production of his, as the <hi>oſtrich her eggs in the wilderneſs,</hi> Lam. iv. 3. but having drawn it out of its firſt chaos, he ſecured it from returning thither again, by eſtabliſhing as a due ſymmetry of parts, ſo alſo a regular order of motion: Hence it is that the heavens have their conſtant revolutions, the earth its ſucceſſion of determinate ſeaſons, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals their alternate courſe of generation and corruption; and by this wiſe econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the world after ſo many thouſand years, ſeems ſtill in its ſpring and firſt beauty. But it had been in vain to have thus ſecured the defection of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if man for whoſe ſake they were made had been excluded from this care. His faculty of reaſon would have made him but the more fatal inſtrument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and taught him the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious ways of diſturbing the world. <hi>Job</hi> compares him <hi>to the wild aſſes colt,</hi> Job xi. 12. which takes its range without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to any thing of the common good.
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031170_0105_0FEB1451E3286D60"/>
God has therefore doubly hedged in this unruly creature, made a fence of laws about him (both natural and poſitive) and beſides has taken him into the common circle of his providence, ſo that he, as well as the reſt of the creation, has his particular ſtation aſſigned him; and that not only in reference to other creatures, but himſelf; has put a difference between one man and another, ordained ſeveral ranks and claſſes of men, and endowed them with ſpecial and appropriate qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for thoſe: ſtations wherein he has ſet them.</p>
               <p n="2">This, as it is a work of infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in God, ſo it is of unſpeakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to men. Without this regular diſpoſure, the world would have been in the ſame confuſion which we read of in the hoſt of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

than he could be in any ſtate of diſcord.</p>
               <p n="3">Were this now well conſidered, methinks it ſhould ſilence all our complaints, and men ſhould not be ſo vehemently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in what part of the ſtructure it pleaſes the great Architect to put them; for every man is to look on himſelf only as a ſmall parcel of thoſe materials which God is to put into form. Every ſtone is not fit for the corner, not every little rafter for the main beam: The wiſdom of the Maſter-builder is alone to determine that. And ſure there cannot be a more vile contempt of the divine wiſdom than to diſpute his choice. Had God wiſdom enough to contrive this vaſt and beautiful fabric, and may he not be truſted with one of us poor worms? Did he by his <hi>wiſdom make the heavens, and by his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſtretch out the clouds;</hi> Prov. iii. 19. and ſhall he not know where to place a little lump of figured earth? This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt abſurd diſtruſt imaginable, and yet this is really the true meaning of our repining at the condition he has placed us in.</p>
               <p n="4">The truth is, we are ſo full of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that we can ſee nothing beyond it: Every man expects God ſhould place him
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:031170_0107_0FEB1456776A0CE8"/>
where he has a mind to be, though by it he diſcompoſe the whole ſcheme of his providence. But though we are are ſo ſenſeleſsly partial, yet God is not ſo: He that comprehends at once that whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of mankind, applies himſelf to the accommodating thoſe, not the humouring any particular perſon. <hi>He that hath made the great and the ſmall, and careth for all alike,</hi> Wiſd. vi. 7. He is the common Father of mankind, and diſpoſes things for the public advantage of this great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and it is not all the impatient crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a froward child that ſhall make him recede from his deſigned method. We are apt enough, I am ſure, to tax it not only as a weakneſs, but injuſtice too in a prince, when he indulges any thing to a private favourite to the public diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yet ſo unequal are we, that we murmur at God for not doing that which we murmur at men for doing.</p>
               <p n="5">Beſides a man is to conſider, that other men have the ſame appetites with himſelf. If he diſlike an inferior ſtate, why ſhould he not think others do ſo too? and then as the wiſe man ſpeaks, <hi>Whoſe voice ſhall the Lord hear?</hi> Ecclus. xxxiv. 24. It is ſure great inſolence in me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould be more concerned to humour me, than thoſe multitudes of

But if all men ſhould have equal ſatisfactions, we ſhould puzzle even Omnipotence it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Every man would be above and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, yet thoſe are comparative terms; and if no man were below, no man could be above. So in wealth, moſt men deſire more, but every man does at leaſt deſire to keep what he has; how then ſhall one part of the world be ſupplied without the diminution of the other, unleſs there ſhould be as miraculous a multiplication of treaſure for a man's avarice, as there was of loaves for their hunger, Matth. xvi. 9. It was a good anſwer which the ambaſſadors of an oppreſt province made to <hi>Anthony,</hi> 
                  <q>If, O emperor, thou wilt have double taxes from us, thou muſt help us to double ſprings and harveſts.</q> And ſure God muſt be at the expence of a new creation, make us a double world, if he ſhould oblige himſelf to ſatisfy all the unreaſonable appetites of men: And if he ſatisfy not all, why ſhould any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon look that his alone ſhould be indulged to him?</p>

6. Yet as unreaſonable at it is, the moſt of us do betray ſuch a perſuaſion. No man is diſcontented that there are lower, as well as higher degrees in the world, that there are poor as well as rich, but all ſenſible men aſſent to the fitneſs of it; yet if themſelves happen to be ſet in the lower form, they exclaim as if the whole order of the world were ſubverted; which is a palpable indication that they think that Providence which governs others ſhould ſerve them, and diſtribute to them not what it, but themſelves think good. This immoderate ſelf-love is the ſpring and root of moſt of our complaints, makes us ſuch unequal judges in our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and prompts us to put in caveats and exceptions on our own behalf, as <hi>David</hi> did on his ſon's, <hi>See that thou hurt not the young man Abſalom,</hi> 2 Sam. xviii. 5. as if God were to manage the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world with a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to our liking, and were like the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels at <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. xix. 22. to <hi>do nothing till we had got into Zoar,</hi> had all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſecured to us.</p>
               <p n="7">It would indeed aſtoniſh a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man to ſee, that although the concerns of men are all diſpoſed by an unerring Wiſdom, and acknowledged by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſo, yet that ſcarce any man
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031170_0110_0FEB145F0CE00540"/>
is pleaſed. The truth is, we have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in us the worſer part of the Leveler's principle, and tho we can very content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly behold multitudes below us, yet are impatient to ſee any above us; not only the <hi>foot</hi> (to uſe the Apoſtle's ſimile) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that it is not the hand, but the ear becauſe it is not the eye,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 15, 16. Not only the lowermoſt, but the higher ranks of men are uneaſy, if there be any one ſtep above them. Nay ſo importunate is this aſpiring humour, that we ſee men are forced to ſeed it, though but with air and ſhadows. He that cannot make any real advance in his quality, will yet do it in effigies, in all little gayeties and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantries of it. Every degree in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects not only emulates, but imitates its ſuperior, till at laſt by that impatience of their proper diſtance they make it greater, and ſink even below their firſt ſtate by their ridiculous profuſion. Indeed the world ſeems to be ſo over-run with this vanity, that there is little viſible diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the degrees, and one had need go to the herald's office to know men's qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, for neither their habit nor equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page do now-a-days inform us with any certainty.</p>
               <p n="8">But by all this it appears, that men look on themſelves only as ſingle perſons,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031170_0111_0FEB146201870D60"/>
without reference to the community whereof they are members. For did they conſider that, they would endeavour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to become the places wherein they were ſet, by doing the duties belonging to them, than be perpetually projecting for a change. A tree that is every year tranſplanted, will never bear fruit, and a mind that is always hurried from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtation, will ſcarce ever do good in any. This is excellently expreſſed to us by <hi>Solomon, As a bird that wandereth from his neſt, ſo is a man that wandereth from his place,</hi> Prov. xxvii. 8. 'Tis eaſy to divine the fate of thoſe young ones from whom the dam wanders, and it is eaſy to gueſs how the duties of that place will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, whoſe owner is always upon the wing, and making towards another. I wiſh we had not too coſtly experiments both in church and ſtate, of the truth of this obſervation. Alas! we forget that we are all ſervants to the ſame Maſter, and that he is to appoint in what office we ſhall ſerve him. How ſhould we like it in any of our own families, to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior officer leave his work undone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has more mind to be a ſuperior officer? Yet this inſolence we every day repeat towards God, ſullenly diſpute his order, and unleſs we may chuſe our own employments, will do nothing.</p>

It is evident, this perverſe temper of mankind breeds a great deal of miſchief and diſturbance in the world, but would breed arrant confuſion and ſubverſion, if it were ſuffered to have its full range. If God permit but one ambitious ſpirit to break looſe in an age, as the inſtrument of his wrath, what deſtruction does it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times make? How does it <hi>cauſe the whole earth to tremble, and ſhake kingdoms,</hi> as is ſaid of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Iſa. xiv. 16. and may be ſaid of many others of thoſe wholeſale robbers who have dignified the trade? But if every aſpiring humour ſhould be as proſperous, where would it find fuel to maintain the flame? No doubt every age produces men of as unbounded deſires as <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Ceſar,</hi> but God gives them not the ſame opportunity to trouble the world. And accordingly in the more petty ambitions of private men he often orders it ſo, that thoſe ſoaring minds can find no benign gale to help ther mounting. He that ſets bounds to the ſea, ſaying <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou come and no farther; and tho' the waves thereof toſs themſelves, yet can they not prevail, tho' they roar, yet can they not paſs over.</hi> Jer. v. 22. does alſo depreſs the ſwelling pride of men, hangs clogs and weights upon them, that they cannot riſe to their affected height.

We may, like unmanaged horſes, foam and fret, but ſtill God has the bridle in our jaws, and we cannot advance a ſtep fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than he permits us. Why ſhould we then create torment to ourſelves by our repinings, which only ſets us further from our aims.

If a ſparrow (as he elſewhere tells his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) cannot fall to the ground without God's particular notice, ſurely no human creature is leſs conſiderable to him; nay, if our very hairs are numbered, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think ths excreſcence is of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than the ſtoke, but muſt conclude that God with a particular advertence, watches over the concerns of every man.</p>
               <p n="2">Now God being infinitely good, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thus attend us upon any inſidious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of doing us miſchief: He watches o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us as a guardian, not as a ſpy; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects his obſervation to the more ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble adapting his benefits. And as he is thus gracious in deſigning our advantage, ſo he is no leſs wiſe in contriving it. <hi> All things,</hi> ſays the wiſe man, <hi>are not profitable for all men,</hi> Ecclaſ. xxxvii. 28. Indeed nothing is abſolutely good but God: all created things are good or ill reference to

that to which they are applied. Meat is good, but to a ſurfeited ſtomach it is not only nauſeous, but dangerous. Fire is good, but if put in our boſoms, not only burns our clothes but fleſh. And as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſdom directs the right application of theſe and the like, ſo the ſupreme and divine, orders events according to the diſpoſition of the perſon concerned; <hi>he knows our frame,</hi> Pſal. ciii. 14. and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns what operation ſuch or ſuch things will have upon us, while we who know neither ourſelves nor them, can make but random gueſſes, and worſe choices. And ſure he that does but thus in the general, acknowledge God's providence, goodeſs and wiſdom (which he is no chriſtian that does not) has a ſufficient cure againſt all his ſolicitudes, much more his repinings. He cannot think he ſuffers unawares to him who ſees all things. He cannot think his ſufferings are deſigned for ill to him, becauſe they are diſpoſed by him who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends and projects his good. Nor can he fear thoſe intentions can miſcarry, which are guided by an infinite and unerring wiſdom, and backed by an uncontrolable power.

Yet becauſe general notions do of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten make but light impreſſions on us, it may not be amiſs to make a little more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, and to obſerve how applicable they are to to the ſeveral kinds of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents. Now thoſe may be reduced to two; for either we are troubled at the want of ſomething we deſire, or at the ſuffering of ſomething we would avert; ſo that the two notions of privative and poſitive, divide between them all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
               <p n="4">The firſt of theſe is uſually the moſt comprehenſive, for there are few who have not more torment from the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of ſomewhat they want, than from the ſmart of any thing they feel. And indeed while our deſires are ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant and exorbitant, they will be ſure to furniſh matter enough for our diſcontents. But certainly there is not in the world ſuch a charm for them, as the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God is more wiſe to diſcern, and more careful to provide what is really good for us than we ourſelves. We poor ſhortſighted creatures look only on the ſurface of things, and if we ſee a beautiful appearance, ſomewhat that invites our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we court it with the utmoſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but God penetrates deeper, he ſees to the bottom both of us and thoſe things

we deſire, and find often though they may pleaſe our appetite, they will hurt our health; and will no more give them to us, than a careful father will to his child thoſe gilded poiſons he cries for. Perhaps this man is taken with the enchanting mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic of fame, likes not his own obſcure ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but would fain preſent himſelf upon a more public. Theatre, come into the eve and could of the world; but how little does he know how he ſhall act his part there; whether he ſhall come off with an applauſe or a hiſs? He may render himſelf but the more public ſpectacle of ſcorn; or if he do not that, he may by a better ſucceſs, feed up his vain glory to ſuch a bulk, as may render him too great weight for that tottering pinnacle whereon he ſtands: and ſo after he has made a tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing circle, he may fall back with more ignominy to his firſt point. Another it may be, no leſs eagerly deſires wealth, thinks (as once <hi>Croeſus</hi> did) that he that abounds in treaſure cannot be empty of felicity; but alas how knows he how he ſhall employ it? There are two contrary temptations that attend riches, riots, and covetouſneſs; and he is ſure a little too confident, that dares promiſe himſelf that when there is ſuch odds againſt him, he ſhall certainly chuſe the one juſt mean;
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:031170_0121_0FEB147FFA8769E8"/>
and if he do not, he does only inflame his account at the great audit. Beſides the more wealth he has, the fairer booty he is to the avarice of others; and it has been often ſeen, that many a man had not died ſo poor, if he had lived leſs rich. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perhaps thinks not himſelf ſo much to want wealth as children to heir it, and complains with <hi>Abraham, Lord, what wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

What is it but interpretatively to deny either his wiſdom, or his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or both? and ſo derogate from him in two of his eſſential attributes. For there can be no rational account given by any who believe thoſe, why they ſhould not remit their whole concerns to him. So that the ſhort account is, that in our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, we either deny him to be God, or ourſelves to be men, by reſiſting the moſt evident dictates of that reaſon which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes us from brutes. For certainly there is not in human diſcourſe a more irrefragable maxim, than that we ought for our own ſakes to reſign ourſelves to him, who, we are infallibly ſure, can, and will chuſe better for us than we for ourſelves.</p>

And ſure this is ſuch a piece of divinity, as extremely reproaches us Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who cannot match a Heathen in his implicit faith to God. Nay indeed 'tis the vileſt defamation upon God himſelf, that we who pretend to know him more, ſhould truſt him leſs. So that we ſee our repinings do not terminate in their own proper guilt, but do in their conſequences ſwell higher, and our diſcontents propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate themſelves into blaſphemy.

               <p n="2">And as afflictions do in general ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us of ſins, ſo it pleaſes God moſt frequently ſo to model and frame them, that they bear the very image and impreſs of thoſe particular guilts they are to chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and are the dark ſhadows that attend our gay delights, or fragrant inſolence.

He that attacks it otherwiſe, will be like <hi>Sertorius's,</hi> ſoldier, who ineffectively tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the horſe's tail to get it off at once, when he that pulled it hair by hair quickly did it. Therefore as it a great part of our ſpiritual wiſdom to know in what eſpecial parts the <hi>Sampſon</hi> like ſtrength of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions lie, ſo it is a great inſtance of God's care of us, thus by his corrections to diſcipline and inſtruct us in it.</p>

Or if nothing can be charged upon the thing gained, let him conſider how he has uſed it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has not made it the fuel of his luſts, in riot and exceſſes, or the object of his adoration in an inordinate value of it. In like manner he who is afflicted in his body, groans under the torment of ſome grievous diſeaſe, may very ſeaſonably interrogate himſelf, whether it has not been contracted by his vice, whether <hi>his bones be not</hi> (in a more literal ſenſe than <hi>Job</hi> meant it) <hi>full of the ſins of his youth,</hi> Job xx. 11. and his ſurfeiting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs be not the cauſe, <hi>that his ſoul,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>abhors all manner of next, and is even hard at death's door,</hi> Pſal. evii. 18. or at leaſt whether the not employing his health and ſtrength to thoſe purpoſes for which it was given, is not the reaſon of its being withdrawn. He alſo that is invaded in his reputation, that lies under ſome great infamy, is to conſider whether it be not deſerved; whether ſome part, if not the whole guilt of which he is accuſed, ſtick not to him: Or if he be clear in that particular inſtance, whether
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031170_0131_0FEB149B709FA990"/>
ſome concealed ſin of his would not if it were known, incur as great ſcandal. For in that caſe he has in right forfeited his reputation, and God may make the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure as well by an unjuſt, as a juſt accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Or if his heart accuſe him not here, yet let him further reflect, whether; his vain-glorious purſuits of praiſe and high conceits of himſelf, have not made this an apt and neceſſary humiliation for him. Or laſtly, let him recollect how he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf towards others in this kind: Whether he has had a juſt tenderneſs of his neighbour's fame, or has not rather expoſed and proſtituted it. In theſe and many other inſtances ſuch a particular ſcrutiny would (in all probability, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the affinity and cognation between our guilts and our puniſhments, and by mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the ſpring and fountain-head, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us how to ſtop or divert the current. And he that would diligently employ himſelf in this inquiſition, would find lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leiſure, and leſs cauſe to condole his afflictions, but would divert all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints upon himſelf, <hi>accept of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his iniquity, and thank the Lord for thus giving him warning,</hi> Pſal. xvi 7.</p>
               <p n="5">A ſecond benefit which God deſigns us in our afflictions, is the weaning us from the world, to diſentangle us from its ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

and charms, and draw us to himſelf. We read in the ſtory of the deluge that ſo long as the earth was covered with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the very raven was contented to take ſhelter in the ark, but when all was fair and dry, even the dove finally forſook it, Gen. viii. 12. And it is much ſo with us: The worſt of men will commonly in diſtreſſes have recourſe to God (the very heathen mariners in a ſtorm could rebuke <hi>Jonah</hi> for not calling upon his God, Jon. i. 6.) when yet the very beſt of us are apt to forget him amidſt the blandiſhments and inſinuations of proſperity. The kind aſpects of the world are very enchanting, apt to inveigle and beſot us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is God's care over us, to let us ſometimes ſee her more averting counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in her frowns and ſtorms; that, as children frighted by ſome ugly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we may run into the arms of our Father. Alas! were all things exactly ſitted to our humours here, when ſhould we think of a remove? and had not death ſome harbingers to prepare us for him, what a ſurpriſing gueſt would he be to us? 'Tis ſtoried of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that ſeeing a ſoldier in his camp of ſo daring a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that he always courted the moſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous attempts, and obſerving him alſo of a very infirm ſickly habit, he took a

particular care of him, and by medicines and good attendance recovered him; which no ſooner had he done, but the man grew more cautious, and would no longer expoſe himſelf as formerly, and gave this reaſon for it, that now he was healthy, his life was of ſome value to him, and not to be hazarded at that ſame rate, as when it was only a burden; and ſhould God cure all our complaints, render us perfectly at eaſe, I fear too many of us would be of the ſoldier's mind, think our lives to good to reſign to him, much more to hazard for him, as our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in many caſes obliges us. The ſon of <hi>Syrach</hi> obſerves, how <hi>dreadful death is to a man that is at reſt in his poſſeſſions, that hath abundance of all things, and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to vex him;</hi> nay he deſcends much lower, and puts in him <hi>who is yet able to receive meat,</hi> Ecclus. xiv. 1. The truth is, we do ſo paſſionately doat upon the world, that like beſotted lovers we can bear a great deal of ill uſage, before we quit our purſuit. Any little ſlight favour atones us after multiplied affronts, and we muſt be diſciplined by repeated diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, e'er we can withdraw our confidence. But how fatally ſecure ſhould we be, if God ſhould permit this ſiren al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to entertain us with her muſic, and ſhould not by ſome diſcordant grating

notes, interrupt our raptures, and recall us to ſober thoughts?</p>
               <p n="6">Indeed it is one of the higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of God's love, and of his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy alſo, thus to project our reducement. We were all in our baptiſm affianced to him, with a particular abrenunciation of the world, ſo that we cannot without the greateſt diſloyalty caſt ourſelves into its embraces; and yet when we have thus <hi>broken the covenant of our God,</hi> God, Prov. ii. 17. he does not purſue us with a jealous rage, with the ſeverity which an abuſed rivalled kindneſs would ſuggeſt; doth not give us a bill of divorce and diſclaim his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but contrives how he may reclaim and bring us back to himſelf. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency of this lenity God excellently deſcribes by the prophet in the caſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, They ſay, if a man put away his wife, and ſhe become another man's, ſhall he return unto her again? but thou haſt played the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot with many lovers, yet return unto me ſaith the Lord?</hi> Jer. iii. 1. And this, though a great height of indulgence, is no more than he daily repeats to us. After we have baſely adulterated with the world, converted our affections from God to it, he does not give us over, abandon us to our lewd courſe, and conſequent ruin; but ſtill invites our return: and leſt that
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031170_0135_0FEB150EC66B2870"/>
may not ſerve, he does with a great deal of holy artifice eſſay to break that accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed league into which we are entered, pulls off the diſguiſe in which the world court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and makes us ſee it as it is in itſelf, a ſcene of <hi>vanity and vexation of ſpirit,</hi> Eccles. i. 14.</p>
               <p n="7">And as he does this in general, ſo alſo with a particular application to thoſe temporal ſatisfactions wherewith we were moſt tranſported. The things to which we are more indifferent do not ſo much endanger us; it is thoſe upon which we have more vehemently ſet our hearts, which become our ſnares, and awake his jealouſy; and accordingly we frequently ſee that it is in thoſe he chuſes to croſs us. How often does it happen that thoſe which are enamoured of themſelves, dote upon their own features, do meet with ſome diſeaſe or accident which blaſts their beauty, withers that fair flower, and makes their winter overtake their ſpring? So in our friends and relations it is uſually ſeen, we ſooneſt looſe thoſe for whom we have the greateſt, the moſt immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate paſſion. If there be one fondling among our children, it is odds but that is taken away, or made as much the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our grief and ſorrow, as ever it was of our joy and love. When God
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031170_0136_0FEB14A714A1C8B8"/>
ſees our hearts ſo exceſſively cleave to any tranſitory thing, he knows it is neceſſary to ſever them, for whilſt we have ſuch clogs upon us, <hi>our ſouls will cleave to the duſt,</hi> will not be able to ſoar up to the higheſt Region for which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</p>
               <p n="8">In a word, God ſo loves us, that he removes whatever he ſees will obſtruct that intimate union which he deſires with us; and ſure this is ſo obliging, that though he ſhould bid us to our loſs, tho' he could not recompence us for what he takes from us, yet we muſt be very ill-natured if we can be angry at ſo much kindneſs. But when to this is added, that all this is principally, nay, ſolely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for our advantage, that God takes from us all theſe empty deluſory content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, merely that he may inſtate us in ſolid and durable joys; we betray as much ignorance of our intereſt, as inſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our obligation, if we repine that God makes us ſo much his care. It is true indeed, the things to which we have ſo inordinately adhered, do ſtick ſo cloſe, that they cannot be pulled away without ſome pain: yet for our corporal ſecurity we can endure the ſundering of parts that do not only cleave, but grow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031170_0137_0FEB14A9EB14DEA0"/>
that has a gangrened member, ſuffers it to be cut off to ſave his whole body, and does not revile, but thank and reward the ſurgeon. Yet where our ſouls are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and where the things have no native union with us, but are only ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by our paſſions, we are impatient of the method, and think God deals very hardly with us, not to to let us periſh with what we love. The ſum of all is this, God, though he be abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending, yet he will never ſtoop ſo low as to ſhare his intereſt in us with the world: If we will devote ourſelves to it, it is not all our empty forms of ſervice will ſatisfy him; if we cannot divorce our hearts from it, he will divorce himſelf eternally from us. And the caſe being thus, we are ſurely very ill adviſed if we do not contentedly reſign ourſelves to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and cheerfully endure them how ſharp ſoever. The only expedient we have for our own caſe, is to ſhorten the cure by giving our aſſiſtance, and not by ſtruggling to render it more difficult and painful. Let us entirely ſurrender our wills to him, and when we have done that, we may without much pain let him take any thing elſe. But the more difficult we find it to be diſentangled from the world, the greater ſhould our caution be againſt all future engagements to it. If our eſcape
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031170_0138_0FEB14ADE6949A28"/>
hath been as the apoſtle ſays, <hi>ſo as by ſire,</hi> Jude 23. with much ſmart and hazard, let us at leaſt have ſo much wit, as the common proverb allows children, and not again expoſe ourſelves; let us never glue our hearts to any external thing, but let all the concerns of the world hang looſe about us: By that means we ſhall be able to put them off inſenſibly when over God calls for them, or perhaps we ſhall prevent his calling for them at all, it being for the moſt part our too cloſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to them which prompts ſum to it.</p>
               <p n="9">A third advantage of affliction is, that it is a mark and ſignature of our adoption, witneſs of our legitimation. <hi>What ſon is he</hi> (faith the apoſtle) <hi>whom the Father chaſtiſeth not? but if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the votaries of the golden calf, to <hi>ſit down to eat and drink, and riſe up to play,</hi> Exod. xxxii. 6. but the diſciples of the crucified Saviour are trained to another diſcipline, our profeſſion enters us into a ſtate of warfare, and accordingly our very bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal engagement runs all in military terms, and we are not only ſervants of Chriſt's family, but ſoldiers of his camp. Now we know in a war men muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to paſs their time in eaſe and ſoftneſs, but beſides all the dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the combat, have many other hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to endure; hunger and thirſt, heat and cold, hard lodgings and weary marches: and he that is too nice for thoſe, will not long ſtick to his colours. And it is the ſame in our ſpiritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; many preſſures and ſufferings are annexed to it, and our paſſive valour is no leſs tried than our active. In reſpect of this it is that our Saviour admoniſhes his proſelytes to compute firſt the difficulties incident to their profeſſion, and that he may not enſnare us by propoſing too eaſy terms, he bids us reckon upon the worſt, and tells us, that he <hi>that forſakes not all that he hath, ſhall not be his diſciple</hi> Luke xiv. 26. <hi>and that we muſt through much tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Acts xiv. 22.

               <p n="10">This hath been ſo much conſidered by pious men, that they have looked upon their ſecular proſperities with fear and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, and many have ſolemnly petitioned for croſſes, as thinking them the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry atteſtation of their ſonſhip, and means of aſſimulation to their elder brother.

Nay ſo neceſſary is our experience towards our commiſeration, that we ſee it was thought a requiſite accompliſhment of our high-prieſt (that higheſt example of unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed compaſſion) and therefore ſaith the apoſtle, <hi>It behoved him in all things to be made like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-prieſt in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, to make reconciliation for the ſins of the people, for in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able alſo to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. ii. 17, 18. But if he whoſe mere ſenſe of our miſeries brought him down to us, choſe this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to advance his pity, how neceſſary is it to our petrified bowels? And ſince God has aſſigned our mercies to our brethren as the ſtandard by which he will proportion his to us, it is more ours than their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to have them enlarged; ſo that when by making us taſte of their cup, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with the bitter reliſh of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; he prepares us to a chriſtian ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with them, it is but a remoter way of obliging and qualifying us for a more ample portion of his mercy. Nay beſides the profit, there is honour accrues to us by it. Compaſſion is one of the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties

of our nature, and we unman our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when we put it off; nay more, it is an attribute of the divinity, and the more we advance in it, the cloſer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches we make to him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have all reaſon to bleſs him for that diſcipline by which he promotes us in to excellent, ſo neceſſary a grace.</p>
               <p n="12">A fifth benefit of affliction, is, that it is an improvement of devotion, ſets us with more heartineſs to our prayers. Whilſt proſperity flows in upon us, we bathe ourſelves in its ſtreams, but are very apt to forget its ſource; ſo that God is fain to ſtop the current, leave us dry and parched, that our needs may make us do what our gratitude would not, trace our bleſſings up to the original ſpring, and both acknowledge and invoke him as the author of all our good. This effect of afflictions is obſerved by the Prophet, <hi>Lord, in trouble have they viſited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chaſtening was upon them,</hi> Iſa. xxvi. 16. And I believe I may appeal to every man's experience, whether his prayers be not more frequent and more hearty too, when he is under ſome diſtreſs. They how importunate are we in our petitions? how profuſe in our vows and promiſes? ſaying with <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Deliver us only we pray thee this day:

and they put away the ſtrange gods from among them, and ſerved the Lord,</hi> Jud. x. 15, 16. I confeſs, it is no good indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our temper, that we need thus to be put in the preſs e're we will yield any thing; yet ſince we are ſo diſingenuous, it is a mercy in God to adapt his methods to us, to extort when we will not give; and if he can have no free-will-offerings, yet at leaſt to exact his tribute. Nor does he deſign the effect of this ſhould ceaſe with the calamity that raiſed it, but expects our compelled addreſſes ſhould bring us into the way of voluntary ones, and happily enſnare us into piety. And indeed herein we are worſe than brutiſh if it do not. We think it a barbarous rudeneſs to engage a man in our affairs, and as ſoon as we have ſerved our own turns, never take farther notice of him. Nay indeed the very beaſts may lecture us in this piece of morality, many of them paying a ſignal gratitude, where they have received benefits; and ſhall we not come up at leaſt to their pitch! ſhall not the endearment of our deliverance bring our Deliverer into ſome repute and conſideration with us, and make us deſire to keep up an acquaintance and intercourſe with him? Yet if ingenuity work not with us, let intereſt at leaſt prevail, and the

A very inſolent folly to renounce that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance by which alone they ſubſiſted, and no leſs will it be in any of us if we ſtop our recourſe to him becauſe we have had advantage by it. We have no aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that the ſame occaſion ſhall not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, but with what face can we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that intercourſe which in the interval we deſpiſed? So that if we have but any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary providence we ſhall ſtill ſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate paſt reſcues, as to continue in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of begging more, and then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but alſo confeſs the benefit of thoſe firſt calamities which inſpirited our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and taught us to pray in earneſt, and will be aſhamed that our thanks ſhould be uttered in a fainter accent than our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or our daily ſpiritual concerns ſhould be more coldly ſolicited than our temporal accidental ones.</p>
               <p n="13">Nor is it only our devotion that is thus improved by our diſtreſſes, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other graces; our faith, our hope, our patience, our Chriſtian ſufferance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. It is no triumph of faith to truſt God for thoſe good things which he gives

                  </gap> than faith; but to rely on him in the greateſt deſtitution, <hi>and againſt hope to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in hope,</hi> this is the ſaith of a true child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and will be <hi>imputed</hi> to us (as it was to him) <hi>for righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. iv. 23, 24. So alſo our patience owes all its opportunities of exerciſe to our afflictions, and conſequently owes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a great part of its being to them, for we know deſuetude will loſe habits. What imaginable uſe is there of patience, where there is nothing to ſuffer? In our proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate we may indeed employ our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, our humility, our caution; but patience ſeems then an uſeleſs virtue: Nay indeed, for ought we know, may be counterfeit, till adverſity bring it to the teſt. And yet this is the moſt glorious accompliſhment of a Chriſtian, that which moſt eminently conforms him to the image of his Saviour, whoſe whole life was a perpetual exerciſe of this grace; and therefore we love our eaſe too well if we are unwilling to buy this pearl at any price.</p>
               <p n="14">Laſtly, Our thankfulneſs is (at leaſt ought to be) increaſed by our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes. It is very natural for us to reflect with value and eſteem upon thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings we have loſt, and we too often do
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:031170_0147_0FEB14C69D434D70"/>
it to aggravate our diſcontent: But ſure, the moſt rational uſe of it is to raiſe our thankfulneſs for the time wherein we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed them. Nay not only our former enjoyments, but even our preſent depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations deſerve our gratitude, if we conſider the happy advantages we may reap from them. If we will perverſely caſt them away, that unworthy contempt pays no ſcores, for we ſtill ſtand anſwerable in God's account for the good he deſigned, and we might have had by it, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come liable to a new charge for our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in thus <hi>deſpiſing the chaſtiſement of the Lord,</hi> Heb. xii. 5.</p>
               <p n="15">And now if all theſe benefits of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions (which are yet but imperfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited) may be thought worth conſidering, it cannot but reconcile us to the ſharpeſt of God's methods; unleſs we will own ourſelves ſuch mere animals, as to have no other apprehenſions than what our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſenſes convey to us. For ſure, he that has reaſon enough to underſtand that he has an immortal ſoul, cannot but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that its intereſts ſhould be ſerved, though with diſplacency of his fleſh. Yet even in regard of that, our murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are oft very unjuſt, for we do many times ignorantly prejudge God's deſigns towards us even in temporals, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031170_0148_0FEB14C990196238"/>
makes a little tranſient uneaſineſs, the paſſage to ſecular felicities. <hi>Moſes</hi> when he fled our of <hi>Egypt,</hi> probably little thought that he ſhould return thither a <hi>God unto Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. iv. 16. and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did <hi>Joſeph</hi> when he was brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſlave, that he was to be a ruler there; yet as diſtant as thoſe ſtates were, the divine Providence has ſo connected them, that the one depends upon the other. And certainly we may often obſerve the like over-ruling hand in our own diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that thoſe events which we have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the greateſt regret, have in the conſequences been very beneficial to us.</p>
               <p n="16">To conclude, we have certainly both from ſpeculation and experience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant matter to calm all our diſquiets, to ſatisfy our diſtruſts, and to fix in us an entire reſignation to God's diſpoſals, who has deſigns which we cannot penetrate, but none which we need fear, unleſs we ourſelves pervert them. We have our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's word for it, that <hi>he will not give us a ſtone when we aſk bread, nor a ſcorpion when we aſk a fiſh,</hi> Matth. vii. 9. Nay his love ſecures us yet farther from the errors of our own wild choice, and does not give us thoſe ſtones and ſcorpions which we

importune for. Let us then leave our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns to him who beſt knows them, and make it our ſole care to entertain his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations with as much ſubmiſſion and duty, as he diſpenſes them with love and wiſdom. And if we can but do ſo, we may dare all the power of earth and hell too, to make us miſerable: For be our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions what they can, we are ſure they are but what we in ſome reſpect or other need; be they privative or poſitive, the want of what we wiſh, or the ſuffering of what we wiſh not, they are the diſpoſals of him who cannot e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <head>Of our Misfortunes compared with other Men's.</head>
               <p>WE come now to impreſs an equally juſt and uſeful conſideration, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of our misfortunes with thoſe of other men: and he that does that, will certainly ſee ſo little cauſe to think himſelf ſingular, that he will not find himſelf ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative in calamity; for there is no man living, that can with reaſon affirm himſelf to be the very unhappieſt man, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing innumerable diſtreſſes of others which he knows not of, and conſequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring them in balance with his own. A multitude of men there are, whoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he knows not, and even of thoſe he does, he may be much a ſtranger to their diſtreſſes; many ſorrows may lie at the heart of him who carries a ſmiling face, and many a man has been an object of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to thoſe who look but on the ſurface of his ſtate, who yet to thoſe who know his private griefs appears more worthy of compaſſion. And ſure this confuſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain eſtimate of other men's afflictions, may divert us from all loud outcries of our own. <hi>Solon</hi> ſeeing a friend much oppreſt with grief, carried him up to a town that
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:031170_0151_0FEB14D222C2C9D8"/>
overlooked the city of <hi>Athens,</hi> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him all the buildings, ſaid to him, Conſider how many ſorrows have, do, and ſhall in future ages inhabit under all thoſe roofs, and do not vex thyſelf with thoſe inconveniencies which are common to mortality, as if they were only yours. And ſure it was good advice, for ſuffering is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as inſeparable and adjunct of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as dying is; yet we do not ſee men very apt to embitter their whole lives by the foreſight that they muſt die, but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a thing as univerſal as inevitable, they are more forward to take up the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure's reſolution, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 32. And why ſhould we not look upon afflictions alſo as the common lot of humanity, and as we take the advantages, ſo be content to bear the incumbrances of that ſtate?</p>
               <p n="2">But beſides that allowance that is thus to be made for the unknown calamities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if we ſurvey but thoſe that lie open &amp; viſible to us, the moſt of us ſhall find e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſcountenance our complaints. Who is there that when he moſt ſtudiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly recollected his miſeries, may not find ſome or other that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

another perſecuted and oppreſſed. He that groans under ſome ſharp pain, may ſee another afflicted with ſharper; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven he that has the moſt acute torments in his body, may ſee another more ſadly cruciated by the agonies of his mind. So that if we would but look about us, we ſhould ſee ſo many foreign occaſions of our pity, that we ſhould be aſhamed to confine it wholly to ourſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">It will perhaps be ſaid, that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be univerſally true, for that there muſt in comparative degrees be ſome loweſt ſtate of miſery; I grant it, but ſtill that ſtate conſiſts not in ſuch an indiviſible point, that any one perſon can have the encloſure; or if it do, it will be ſo hard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

And indeed he had reaſon for his ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for conſidering how great a part of many man's afflictions are of their own making, fictitious and imaginary, they may juſtly fear leaſt they ſhould exchange feathers for lead, their own empty ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows for their real and preſſing calamities of others, and cannot but think it beſt to ſit down with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">Nay even where the exchange ſeems more equal, where the afflictions are on both ſides ſolid and ſubſtantial, yet a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man would ſcarce venture upon the barter. It is no ſmall advantage to know what we have to conteſt with, to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the worſt of its attacks, by which we become better able to guard ourſelves: But a new evil comes with the force of a ſurpriſe, and finds us open and diſarmed. It is indeed almoſt a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous power that cuſtom has in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling us to things otherwiſe diſpleaſing; all our ſenſes are taught to remit of their adverſion by familiarity with ungrateful objects; that ugly form which at firſt makes us ſtart, by uſe diveſts its terror, and we reconcile ourſelves to harſh ſounds and ill reliſhes by long cuſtom. And ſure it has the very ſame effect upon our minds, the moſt fierce calamities do by acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance grow more tractable, ſo that he that exchanges an old one for a new, does but bring a wild lion into his houſe inſtead of a tame: It may for ought he knows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately tear him in pieces, but at leaſt muſt coſt him a great deal of pains to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it gentle and familiar, and certainly no wiſe man would wiſh to make ſuch a bargain.</p>

By all this it appears that how extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly ſoever we aggravate our own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and extenuate other men's<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we dare not upon recollection ſtand to our own eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate, and what can be ſaid more in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of our diſcontents? It is a grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed maxim, that every man muſt have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, <hi>Man that is born of a woman,</hi> ſays Job, <hi>is of few years, and full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Job xiv. 1. And we muſt reverſe God's fundamental law, before we can hope for a total exemption. All that any man can aſpire to, is to have but an equal ſhare with others, and the generality of men have ſo, at leaſt none can prove he has not ſo; and till he can, his murmurs will ſurely be very unjuſtifiable, eſpecially when they have this convincing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance againſt them, that he dares not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſober thoughts change his afflictions with moſt of his neighbours. He is an ill member of a commnnity, who in public aſſeſſments would ſhuffle off all payments; and he is no better, who in this common tax God has laid upon our nature, is not content to bear his ſhare.</p>
               <p n="6">And truly would we but conſider that in all our ſufferings nothing befalls us but what is common to our kind, nay, which is extremely exceeded by many within the verge of our own obſervation,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:031170_0156_0FEB14E0812F0E08"/>
we muſt be ſenſeleſly partial to be impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. The Apoſtle thought it a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent conſolation for the firſt chriſtians, that <hi>there had no temptation befallen them but what was common to men,</hi> 1 Cor. x. 13. and we betray very extravagant opinions of ourſelves if it be not ſo to us. Indeed it is ſcarce poſſible for us to be ſo unſatisfied as the greateſt part of us are, did we in the comparing ourſelves with others, proceed with any tolerable ingenuity.</p>
               <p n="7">But alas we are very fallacious and deceitful in the point, we do not compare the good of others with our good, nor their evil with our evil; but with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious curioſity we amaſs together all the deſirable circumſtances of our neighbours condition, and with as prying diſcontent we ranſack all our grievances, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to them. This is ſo inſincere a way of proceeding, as the moſt ordinary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding can detect. If I ſhould wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that my arm were longer than another man's, and for trial meaſure my arm with his finger, he muſt be ſtupidly ſilly, that ſhould award me for it: and yet this were not a groſſer cheat, than that which we put upon ourſelves, in our compariſons with others. And it is a little ſtrange to obſerve unto what various purpoſes we
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:031170_0157_0FEB14E3935FD2D8"/>
can apply this one thin piece of ſophiſtry, for when we compare our neighbours and ourſelves in point of morality, we do but reverſe the fallacy, and preſently make his vices as much exceed ours, as our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did his in the other inſtance. They are indeed both great violences to reaſon and juſtice, yet the latter is ſure the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanter kind of deceit. A man has ſome joy in thinking himſelf leſs wicked than his neighbour, but what imaginable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can he take in thinking himſelf more miſerable?

               <head>Of Particular Aids for the gaining of Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</head>
               <p>WE have now paſſed through all thoſe conſiderations we at firſt propoſed, and may truſt the conſidering reader to make his own collections: yet becauſe impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the vice that has been all this while arraigned, I am to foreſee if poſſible, that thoſe who have the greateſt degree of that, may be the leaſt willing to attend the whole proceſs; and therefore I think it may not be amiſs, for their eaſe to ſuit and reduce all into ſome ſhort directions and rules for the acquiring contentment.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="172" facs="unknown:031170_0171_0FEB150A4B1182E8"/>
The firſt and moſt fundamental is, the mortifying our pride, which as it is the ſeminary of moſt ſins, ſo eſpecially this of repining. Men that are highly opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioned of themſelves are commonly unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfiable: For how well ſoever they are treated, they ſtill think it ſhort of their merits. Princes have often experimented this in thoſe who have done them ſignal ſervices; but God finds it in thoſe who have done him none, and we expect he ſhall diſpenſe to us according to thoſe falſe eſtimates we put upon ourſelves. Therefore he that aſpires to content, muſt firſt take truer meaſures of himſelf, and conſider that as he was nothing till God gave him a being, ſo all that he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from that being, is God's by origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal right, and therefore can pretend to nothing of reward; ſo that whatever he receives, is ſtill upon the account of a new bounty; and to complain that he has no more, is like the murmurs of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful debtor, who would ſtill increaſe thoſe ſcores which he knows he can never pay.</p>
               <p n="3">In the ſecond place, let every man conſider how many bleſſings (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his having no claim to any) he daily enjoys; and whether thoſe he ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently raves after, be not much inferior
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031170_0172_0FEB150BEBF9FAF8"/>
to them. Nay let him aſk his own heart whether he would quit all thoſe he has, for them he wants; and if he would not (as I ſuppoſe no man in his wits would, thoſe wits being part of the parter) let him then judge how unreaſonable his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinings are, when himſelf confeſſes he has the better part of worldly happineſs, and never any man living had all.</p>
               <p n="4">In the third place therefore let him ſecure his duty of thankfulneſs for thoſe good things he hath, and that will inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly undermine his impatiencies for the reſt, it being impoſſible to be at once thankful and murmuring. To this purpose it were very well, if he would keep a ſolemn catalogue of all the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, protections, and deliverances he has received from God's hand, and every night examine what acceſſions that day has brought to the ſum: And he that did this, would undoubtedly find ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations to gratitude, that all thoſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content would be ſtifled in the croud. And ſince acknowledgement of God's mercies is all the tribute he exacts for them, we muſt certainly look on that as an indiſpenſable duty: And therefore he that finds that God ſhortens his hand, ſtops the efflux of his bounty towards
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031170_0173_0FEAE55BC76E5030"/>
him, ſhould reflect on himſelf whether he be not behind in that homage by which he holds, and have not by his unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>turned away good things from him,</hi> Iſai. lix. 1. And if he find it ſo (as who alas is there that may not!) he cannot ſure for ſhame complain, but muſt in prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce his gratitude for what is left, as the beſt means to recover what he has loſt.</p>
               <p n="5">But his murmurs will yet be more amazingly ſilenced, if in the fourth place he compares the good things he enjoys with the ill he has done. Certainly this is a moſt infallible cure for our impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the holieſt man living being able to accuſe himſelf of ſuch ſins, as would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all human meaſures of equity forfeit all bleſſings, and pull down a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er weight of judgment than the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable groan under. Therefore as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I adviſed to keep a catalogue of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received, so here it would be of uſe to draw up one of ſins committed. And doubtleſs he that confronts the one with the other, cannot but be aſtoniſhed to find them both ſo numerous, equally wondering at God's mercy in continuing his bleſſings, in deſpite of all his provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and at his own baſeneſs in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his provocations in deſpite of all thoſe
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031170_0174_0FEB1511BAB25630"/>
bleſſings. Indeed it is nothing but our affected ignorance of our demerits, that makes it poſſible for us to repine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſevereſt of God's diſpenſations. Would we but ranſack our hearts, and ſee all the abominations that lie there, nay would the moſt of us but recollect thoſe barefaced crimes which even the world can witneſs againſt us, we ſhould find more than enough to balance the heavieſt of our preſſures. When therefore by our impatient ſtrugglings we fret and gall our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under our burdens, let us interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate our ſouls in the words of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Why doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſin?</hi> Let us not ſpend our breath in murmurs and outcries, which will only ſerve to provoke more ſtripes: But <hi>let us ſearch and try our ways, and</hi> turn <hi>again to the Lord,</hi> Lam. iii. 39, 43. diligently ſeek out <hi>that accurſed thing</hi> which has cauſed our diſcomfiture, and by the removal of that, prepare the way for the acceſs of mercy. But alas how prepoſterous a method do we take in our afflictions! We accuſe every thing but what we ought, furiouſly fly at all the ſecond cauſes of our calamity, nay too often at the firſt, by impious diſputes of providence, and in the mean time, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>the root of the matter is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound in us,</hi> Job xix. 28. We ſhelter and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:031170_0175_0FEB1515B5A48370"/>
in our boſoms the real author of our miſeries. The true way then to allay the ſenſe of our ſufferings, is to ſharpen that of our ſins. The prodigal thought the meaneſt condition in his father's family a preferment, <hi>Make me one of thy hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> Luke xv. 19. And if we have his penitence, we ſhall have his ſubmiſſion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and calmly attend God's diſpoſals of us.</p>
               <p n="6">As every man in his afflictions is to look inward on his own heart, ſo alſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and conſider by whoſe providence all events are ordered. <hi>Is there any evil</hi> (i. e. of puniſhment) <hi>in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Amos iii. 6. and what are we worms that we ſhould diſpate with him? Shall a man contend with his maker? Let the <hi>potſherd ſtrive with the potſherds of the earth,</hi> Iſa. xlv. 9. And as his power is not to be controlled, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his juſtice to be impeached, <hi>Shall not the judge of all the earth do right?</hi> Gen. xviii. 25. And where we can neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt nor appeal, what have we to do but humbly to ſubmit? Nor are we only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to it by neceſſity, but induced and invited by intereſt, ſince his diſpenſations are directed not barely to aſſert his, domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but to evidence his paternal care over us. He diſcerns our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="177" facs="unknown:031170_0176_0FEB15175B115240"/>
applies to us. The benignity of his nature permits him not to take delight in our diſtreſſes, <hi>he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men,</hi> Lam. iii. 33. and therefore whenever he adminiſters to us a bitter cup, we may be ſure the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents are medicinal, and ſuch as our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities require. He dares not truſt our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate appetites with unmixed proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, the luſciouſneſs whereof, though it may pleaſe our palates, yet like St. <hi>John's</hi> book, Rev. x. 9. that <hi>honey in the mouth may prove gall in the bowels,</hi> ingender the moſt fatal diſeaſes. Let us therefore in our calamaties <hi>not conſult with fleſh and blood,</hi> Gal. i. 16. (which the more it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned, the more it complains) but look to the hand that ſtrikes; and aſſure our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the ſtripes are not more ſevere, than he ſees neceſſary to our good: And ſince they are ſo, they ought in reaſon to be our choice as well as his; and not only religion, but ſelf-love will prompt us to ſay, with old <hi>Ely, It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> 1 Sam. iii. 18. But alas! we do not underſtand what is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; becauſe we do not rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what we are ourſelves. We conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ourſelves merely in our animal being, our bodies and thoſe ſenſitive faculties veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in them, and when we are invaded there, we think we are undone, though

                  </gap> us, beſieged and oppreſſed with the fleſh about it. (for ſo God knows it too often is) or if we do not conſider it in that notion of an enemy, yet at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt eſtimate, the body is to the ſoul but as the garment to the body, a decent caſe to cover: Now what man (not ſtark fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic) would rather have his clothes cut than his fleſh? and then by the rate of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we may well queſtion our own ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, when we repine that our ſouls are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured at the coſt of our bodies, and that is certainly the worſt, the unkindeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and our impatient reſiſtances ſerve only to fruſtrate the kind, and medicinal part of affliction, but will not at all reſcue us from the ſevere. Our murmurings may ruin our ſouls, but will never avert any of our outward calamaties.</p>
               <p n="7">A ſeventh help to contentment is to have a right eſtimate of the world, and the common ſtate of humanity: To conſider the world but as a ſtage and ourſelves but as actors, and to reſolve that it is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle material, what part we play ſo we do it well. A comedian may get as much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe by acting the ſlave as the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and he that acts the one to day, may to-morrow reverſe the part, and perſonate the other. So great are the viciſſitudes of the world, that there is no building any
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:031170_0178_0FEB151D44C48138"/>
firm hopes upon it. All the certainty we have of it, is, that in every condition is has its uneaſineſs; ſo that when we court a change we rather ſeek to vary than end our miſeries. And certainly he that has well impreſſed upon his mind the vanity and vexation of the world, cannot be much ſurpriſed at any thing that befalls him in it. We expect no more of any thing but to do its kind, and we may as well be angry tkat we cannot bring the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to our cribs, or fix the wind to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain point, as that we cannot ſecure our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from dangers and diſappointments, in this rough and mutable world. We are therefore to lay it as an infallible maxim, that in this vale of tears every man muſt meet with ſorrows and diſaſters: And then ſure we may take our peculiar with even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of temper, as being but the natural conſequent of our being men. And tho' poſſibly we may every one think himſelf to have a double portion, yet that is uſually from the deceitful compariſon we make of ourſelves with others. We take the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying glaſſes of diſcontent and envy, when we view our own miſeries and others felicities, but look on our enjoyments and their ſufferings through the contracting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He that will compare to good purpoſe muſt do it honeſtly and ſincerely, and view his neighbors calamaties with the ſame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention he does his own, and his own comforts with the ſame he does his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors; and then many of the great seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inequalities would come pretty near a level.</p>
               <p n="8">But even where they do not, it in the eighth place deſerves however to be conſidered how illnatured a thing it is, for any man to think himſelf more miſerable becauſe another is happy; and yet this is the very thing, by which alone many men have made themſelves wretched: For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have created wants, merely from the envious contemplation of other men's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance. And indeed there is nothing more diſingenuous, or (to go higher) more diabolical. Lucifer was happy enough in his original ſtate, yet could not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo, becauſe he was <hi>not like the moſt high,</hi> Iſa. xiv. 14. And when by that inſolent ambition he had forfeited bliſs, it has ever ſince been an aggravation of his torment, that mankind is aſſumed to a capacity of it; and accordingly he makes it the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his envious induſtry to defeat him. Now how perfectly are the two firſt parts of this copy tranſcribed, by thoſe who firſt cannot be ſatisfied with any inferior

degree of proſperity, and then whet their impatience with other mens enjoyments of what they cannot attain? And it is much to be doubted, that they who go thus far may complete their parallel, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor when they have opportunity to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine that happineſs they envy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince Satan is ſo apt to impreſs his whole image, where he has drawn any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neament, it concerns us warily to guard ourſelves, and by a chriſtian ſympathy with our brethren, <hi>rejoice with them that do rejoice,</hi> Rom. xii. 15. make the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of others an allay, not an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our own miſeries. Charity has a ſtrange magnetic power, and attracts the concerns of our brethren to us, and he that has that in his breaſt can never want refreſhment, whilſt any about him are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; for by adopting their intereſt, he ſhares in their joys. <hi>Jethro,</hi> though an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien, <hi>rejoiced for all the good God had done to Iſrael,</hi> Exod. xviii. 9. and why ſhould not we have as ſenſible a concurrence with our fellow chriſtians? And he that has ſo, will ſtill find ſomething to balance his own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</p>

at the wrong end, we <hi>enlarge our deſires as hell, and cannot be ſatisfied,</hi> Hab. ii. 5. and then think God uſes us ill, if he do not fill our inſatiable appetites; Whereas if we would confine our expectations to thoſe things which we need, or he has promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there are few of us who would not find them abundantly anſwered. Alas! how few things are there which our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (if not ſtimulated by fancy and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury) requires? And how rare is it to find them who want thoſe? Nay who have not many additionals for delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? And yet God's promiſe under the goſpel extends only to thoſe neceſſaries; for when Chriſt aſſures his diſciples that <hi>theſe things ſhall be added unto them,</hi> Mat. vi. 33. the content apparently reſtrains <hi>theſe things</hi> to meet and drink and cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

God never articled with the ambitious to give him honors, or with the covetous to fill his bags, or with the voluptuous to feed his luxuries. Let us therefore, if we expect to be ſatisfied, modeſtly confine our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires within the limits he has ſet us: And then every acceſſion which he ſuperadds will appear (what it is) a mercy and

bounty. But whilſt our appetites are boundleſs, and rather ſtretched than fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our acqueſts, what poſſibility is there of their ſatisfaction? And when we importune God for it, we do but aſſign him ſuch a taſk the poets made a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of their hell, the filling a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="10">A great expedient for contentment, is to confine our thoughts to the preſent, and not to let them looſe to future events. Would we but do this, we might ſhake off a great part of our burden: For we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten heap fantaſtic loads upon ourſelves by anxious preſages of things which perhaps will never happen, and yet ſink more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, than under the real weight that is actually upon us; and this is certainly one of the greateſt follies imaginable; for either the evil will come or it will not; if it will, it is ſure no ſuch deſirable gueſt that we ſhould go out to meet it, we ſhall feel it time enough when it falls on us, we not project to anticipate our ſenſe of it; but if it will not, what extreme mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is it for a man to torment himſelf with that which will never be, to create engines of tortures, and by ſuch aerial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, make himſelf as miſerable as the moſt real ones could do? and truly this
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031170_0183_0FEAE5646F175028"/>
is all that we uſually get by our foreſights. Proviſion is one of God's attributes, and he mocks all our pretences to it, by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent defeating of all our fore-caſts. He does it often in our hopes: ſome little croſs circumſtance many times demoliſhes thoſe goodly machines we raiſe to ourſelves and he does it no leſs in our fears: Thoſe ills we ſolemnly expected often baulk us, and others from an unexpected coaſt ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly invade us. And ſince we are ſo blind, ſo ſhort-ſighted, let us never take upon us to be ſcouts, to diſcover danger at a diſtance (for it is manifold odds we ſhall only bring home falſe alarms) but let us reſt ourſelves upon that moſt admirable maxim of our bleſſed Lord, <hi>Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,</hi> Mat. vi. 34. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ourſelves with Chriſtian courage to bear the preſent, and leave God either to augment or diminiſh, as he ſees fit, for the future. Or if he will needs be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, let it be in obedience not in contradiction to our duty; let us enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ourſelves with thoſe futurities which we are ſure are not chimeras, death and judgment, heaven and hell. The nearer we draw theſe things to our view, the more inſenſible will all intermediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects be; they will deceive our ſenſe of preſent, and much more foreſtall the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of future evils: For it is our

neglect of things eternal, that leaves us thus at leiſure for the tranſitory.</p>
               <p n="11">In the laſt place, let us in all our diſtreſſes ſuperſede our anxieties and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudes by that moſt effectual remedy the apoſtle preſcribes, <hi>Is any man afflicted let him pray,</hi> Jam. v. 13. And this ſure is a moſt rational preſcription: For alas! what elſe can we do towards the redreſs of our griefs. We who are ſo impotent, that we have not power over the moſt deſpicable excreſcence of our own body, cannot make <hi>one hair white or black,</hi> Matth. v. 36. what can we do towards the new mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our condition, or modelling things without us? Our ſolicitudes ſerve only to bind our burdens faſter upon us, but this expedient of prayer will certainly relieve us, <hi>Call upon me,</hi> ſays God, <hi>in the time of trouble, and I will hear thee, and thou ſhalt praiſe me,</hi> Pſal. 1. 15. Whenever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ſinking in the floods of afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us thus ſupport ourſelves by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting our wants unto our gracious Lord, cry unto him a St. <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Lord ſave me,</hi> Matt. xiv. 30. and he will take us by the hand, and be the winds never ſo boiſterous or contrary, preſerve us from ſinking: The waves and billows of this troubleſome world will ſerve but to toſs

us cloſer into his arms, who can with a word appeaſe the rougheſt tempeſt, or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue us from it.

And as this is a ſure expedient in all our real important afflictions, ſo is it a good teſt by which to try what are ſo. We are often peeviſh and diſquieted at trifles, nay we take up the quarrels of our luſts and vice, and are diſcontented when they want their wiſhed ſupplies. Now in either of theſe caſes, no man that at all conſiders who he prays to, will dare to inſert theſe in his prayers, it being a contempt of God to invoke him in things ſo ſlight as the one, or impious as the other. It will therefore be good for every man when he goes to addreſs for relief, to conſider what of his preſſures they are that are worthy of that ſolemn deprecation: and when he has ſingled thoſe out, let him reflect, and he will find he has in that prejudged all his other diſcontents as frivolous or wicked. And then ſure he cannot think fit to harbour them, but muſt for ſhame diſmiſs them, ſince they are ſuch as he dare not avow to him from whom alone he can expect relief. God always pities our real miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

but our imaginary ones dare not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.

               <p>AND now amidſt ſuch a variety of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, it will be hard to inſtance any one ſort of calamity which can eſcape their efficacy, if they be but duly applied. But indeed we have generally a compendious way of fruſtrating all remedies by never making uſe of them: Like fantaſtic pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients we are well enough content to have our diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aſe diſcourſed, and medicines pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but when the phyſic comes, have ſtill ſome pretence or other to protract the taking it. But I ſhall beſeech the reader to conſider, that counſels are not charms, to work without any co-operation of the concerned perſon: They muſt be advert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, they muſt be pondered and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and finally they muſt be practiſed, or elſe the utmoſt good, they can do us, is to give us a few hours divertiſement in the reading. But they do us a miſchief that infinitely outweighs it, for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our guilts by the ineffective tender they make of reſcuing us from them, and leave us accountable not only for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal crimes, but for our obſtinate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion to them in ſpite of admonition.</p>

I ſay this becauſe it is a little too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that many take up books only as they do cards or dice, as an inſtrument of diverſion. It is a good entertainment of their curioſity to ſee what can be ſaid upon any ſubject, and be it well or ill-handled, they can pleaſe themſelves equally with the ingenuity or rediculouſneſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, and when they have done this, they have done all they deſigned. This indeed may be tolerable in romances and play-books, but ſure it ill benefits divinity. And yet I fear it ofteneſt happens there: for in the former ſome do project for ſome trivial improvements, as the embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of their ſtile, the inſpiriting of their fancies; and ſome men would ſcarce be able to drive their pedling trade of wit, did they not thus ſweep the ſtage: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! how many books of piety are read, of which one cannot diſcern the leaſt tincture in men's converſations, which ſure does in a great meaſure proceed from the want of a determinate deſign in their reading, men's practice being not apt to be leſs ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers than their ſpeculation. He that takes a practical ſubject in hand, muſt do it with a deſign to conform his practice to what he ſhall there be convinced to be his duty, and he that comes not with this probity of mind, is not like to be much benefited by his reading.</p>

But one would think this ſhould be an unneceſſary caution at this time, for ſince the intent of this tract, is only to ſhew man the way to contentment, it is to be ſuppoſed the readers will be as much in earneſt as the writer can be, it being every man's proper and moſt important intereſt, the inſtating him in the higheſt and moſt ſupreme felicity that this world can admit: yet for all this fair probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I doubt many will in this inſtance have the ſame indifference they have in their other ſpiritual concerns.</p>
               <p n="4">It is true indeed that a quer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Their friends, their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, their meat, their drink, every thing grows nauſeous to them, and in a frantic diſcontent, they often ſling away thoſe things which they moſt value. Beſides, this peeviſh impatience is of ſo aerial a diet, that it is ſcarce poſſible to ſtarve it. It will nouriſh itſelf phantaſms and chimeras, ſuborn a thouſand ſurmiſes and imaginary diſtreſſes to abet its pretences: and though every one of us can remonſtrate to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the unreaſonableneſs of this diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; yet ſcarce any one of us will draw the argument home, or ſuffer ourſelves to be convinced by what we urge as irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable to others. Nay, farther, this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour is impatient of any diverſion, loves to coverſe only with itſelf. In bodily pains, men that deſpair of cure are yet glad of allays and mitigations, and ſtrive by all arts, to divert and deceive the ſenſe of their anguiſh; but in this diſeaſe of the mind, men cheriſh and improve their torment, roll and chew the bitter pill in their mouth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, that they may be ſure to have its utmoſt flavor; and by devoting all their thoughts to the ſubject of their grief, keep up an uninterrupted ſenſe of it: as if they had the ſame tyranny for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves which <hi>Caligula</hi> had for others, and
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:031170_0191_0FEB154011EE0AC8"/>
loved to feel themſelves die. Indeed, there is not a more abſurd contradiction in the world, than to hear men cry out, of the weight, the intolerableneſs of their burden, and yet graſp it as faſt as if their life were bound up in it; will not depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit it, no not for the ſmalleſt breathing time. A ſtrange faſcination ſure, and yet ſo frequent, that it ought to be the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental care of him that would cure men of their diſcontents, to bring them to a herty willingneſs of being cured.</p>
               <p n="5">It may be, this will look like para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, and every man will be apt to ſay he wiſhes nothing more in earneſt, that to be cured of his preſent diſcontent. He that is poor would be cured by wealth, he that is low and obſcure by honour and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But ſo an hydropic perſon may ſay he deſires to have his thirſt cured by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſupply of drink: yet all ſober peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple know, that this is the way only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it; but let the whole habit of the body be rectified, and then the thirſt will ceaſe of itſelf. And certainly it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame in the preſent caſe: No outward acceſſions will ever ſatisfy our cravings, our appetites muſt be tamed and reduced, and then they will never be able to ariſe tumults, or put us into mutiny or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and he (and none but he) that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031170_0192_0FEB15440E974678"/>
to this method, can truly be ſaid to deſire a cure.</p>
               <p n="6">But he that thus atteſts the reality of his deſires, and ſeeks contentment in its proper ſphere, may ſurely arrive to ſome conſiderable degrees of it. We find in all ages men that only by the direction of natural light have calmed their diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and reaſoned themſelves into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, even under great and ſenſible preſſures; men who amidſt the acuteſt torments have ſtill preſerved a ſerenity of mind, and have fruſtrated contempts and reproaches by diſregarding them: and ſure we give a very ill account of our Chriſtianity, if we cannot do as much with it, as they did without it.</p>
               <p n="7">I do not here propoſe ſuch a ſtoical inſenſibility as makes no diſtinction of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, which, though it has been vainly pretended to by many, yet ſure was never attained by any upon the ſtrength of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Some natural dullneſs or caſual ſtupifaction muſt concur to that, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by doing ſo, has had the luck to be canonized for virtue. I mean only ſuch a ſuperiority of mind as raiſes us above our ſufferings though it exempts us not from the ſenſe of them. We cannot pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

to ourſelves a higher pattern in any virtue than our bleſſed Lord: Yet we ſee he not only felt that load under which he lay, but had the moſt pungent and quick ſenſe of it, ſuch as prompted thoſe earneſt deprecations, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this cup paſs:</hi> Yet all thoſe diſplacencies of his fleſh were ſurmounted by the reſignation of his ſpirit, <hi>nevertheleſs not what I will but what thou wilt,</hi> Luke xii. 42. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he that in imitation of this pattern does in ſpite of all the reluctancies of his ſenſe, thus entirely ſubmit his will how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he may be ſad, yet he is not impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; nor is he like to be ſad long, for to him that is thus reſigned, <hi>light will ſpring up,</hi> Pſal. xcvii. 11. ſome good angel will be lent like that to our Saviour to relieve his diſconſolation. God will ſend either ſome outward allays, or give ſuch interior comforts and ſupports, as ſhall counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe thoſe afflictions he takes not off.</p>
               <p n="8">Indeed the grand deſign of God in correcting us, is (the ſame with that of a prudent parent towards his child) to break our wills. That ſtubborn faculty will ſcarce bend with eaſy touches, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does require ſome force: And when by that rougher handling, he has brought it to a pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

this deſign, to aſſiſt as much as we are able towards the ſubjugating this unruly part of ourſelves. This is that <hi>Sheba,</hi> 2 Sam. xx. 22. the ſurrendering of whom is God's expectation in all the cloſe ſieges he lays to us. Let us then be ſo wiſe, as by an early reſigning it to divert his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hoſtilities, and buy our peace with him.</p>
               <p n="9">And truly this is the way not only to gain peace with him, but ourſelves too: It is the uſurpation of our will over our reaſon which breeds all the confuſion and tumults within our own breaſts, and there is no poſſibility of curbing its inſolence, but by putting it into ſafe cuſtody, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it to him who (as our church teaches us) alone can order the unruly wills of ſinful men. Indeed nothing but experience can fully inform us of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity and calm of that ſoul who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his will to God. All care of chuſing for himſelf is happily ſuperſeded, he is tempted to no anxious forecaſts for future events, for he knows nothing can happen in contradiction of that ſupreme wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Certainly there is not in the world ſuch a holy ſort of artifice, ſo divine a charm to tie our God to us, as this of reſigning ourſelves to him. We find the Gibeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites by yielding themſelves vaſſals to the Iſraelites had their whole army at their back to reſcue them in their danger, Joſh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p n="10">Further yet, when by reſignation we have united our wills to God, we have quite changed the ſcene, and we who when our wills ſtood ſingle, were liable to perpetual defeats, in this bleſſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination can never be croſſed. When our will is twiſted and involved with God's, the ſame omnipotence which backs his will, does alſo attend ours. God's will, we are ſure, admits of no controul, can never be reſiſted, and we have the fame ſecurity for ours, ſo long as it concurs with it. By this means all calamities are unfringed, and even thoſe things which are moſt repugnant to our ſenſitive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are yet very agreeable to our ſpirits, when we conſider they are implicitly our own choice, ſince they are certainly
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:031170_0196_0FEAE57412FD6B70"/>
his, whom we have deputed to elect for us. Indeed there can be no face of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſo averting and formidable, which ſet in this light will not look amiable. We ſee daily how many uneaſineſſes and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices men will contentedly ſuffer in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of their wills: And if we have really eſpouſed God's, made his will ours, we ſhall with as great (nay far greater) ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity embrace its diſtributions, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy ſoever to our ſenſe; our ſouls will more acquieſce in the accompliſhment of the divine will, than our fleſh can reluct to any ſevere effects of it.</p>
               <p n="11">Here then is that footing of firm ground, on which whoſoever can ſtand, may indeed do that which <hi>Archimedes</hi> boaſted, move the whole world. He may as to himſelf ſubvert the whole courſe, of ſublunary things, unvenom all thoſe cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which are to others the gall of aſps; and in a further ſenſe verify that evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical prophecy, of <hi>beating ſwords into plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and ſpears into pruning books,</hi> Iſai. ii. 4. the moſt hoſtile weapons, the moſt adverſe events, ſhall be by him converted into inſtruments of fertility, ſhall only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his ſpiritual growth.</p>

               <p>THIS ſhort inſtitution of the <hi>Art of Contentment,</hi> cannot more naturally or more deſirably draw to a concluſion, than in the reſort we have given it, in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of Divine Providence. The Roman conquerors, as the laſt pitch of their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, went to the capitol, and laid their garlands in the lap of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> But the Chriſtian has an eaſier way to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, to put his crown of thorns (for that is the trophy of his victories) within the arms of his gracious God; there lodge his ſcars, his wants, his ſorrows, and himſelf too, as in the beſt repoſitory.</p>
               <p n="2">The Goſpel command of <hi>not caring for the morrow,</hi> Mat. vi. 34. and being <hi>careful for nothing,</hi> Phil. iv. 6. nakedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, might ſeem the abandoning of us to all the calamities of life: But when we are directed to <hi>caſt all our care</hi> upon a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and all powerful parent, and are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that <hi>he cares for us,</hi> 1 Pet. v. 7. that <hi>though a woman may forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion of the ſon of her womb, yet will be not forget his children,</hi> Iſai. xlix. 15. this will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſuperſede all cavil and objection.
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:031170_0200_0FEB154B6E6EDF10"/>
Whilſt worldly men truſt in an arm of fleſh, lay up <hi>treaſure on earth,</hi> a prey for <hi>ruſt and moth,</hi> Mat. vi. 19. and a <hi>torment</hi> to themſelves, Jam. v. 3. the Chriſtian has Omnipotence for his ſupport, and a <hi>treaſure in heaven, where no thief approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nor moth corrupts,</hi> Mat. vi. 20. Whilſt bold inquirers call in queſtion God's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will, oblige him to their ſub or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pralapſarian ſchemes, their abſolute or conditional decrees, their grace foreſeen or predetermined; the pious man with aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acquieſcence ſubmits to that which is revealed, reſolves for ever to obey, but never to diſpute: as knowing that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved diſciple leaned on his Maſter's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; but it is the thieves and traitors part to go about to rifle it.</p>
               <p n="3">It is ſurely a modeſt demand in the behalf of God almighty, that we ſhould allow him as much privilege in his world, as every peaſant claims in his cottage; to be maſter there, and diſpoſe of his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold as he thinks beſt: To <hi>ſay to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to his ſervant, Do this, and he doth it,</hi> Mat. viii. 9. And if we would afford him this liberty, there would be an immediate and put to all clamour and complaint.</p>

4. We make it our daily prayer that the <hi>will</hi> of God <hi>may be done on earth as it is in heaven,</hi> with a ready, ſwift, and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted conſtancy. As it is giant-like re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion to ſet up our will againſt his, ſo is it mad perverſeneſs to ſet it up againſt our own; be diſpleaſed that our requeſts are granted, and repine that his, and therewith our will is done. It were indeed not only good manners, but good policy, to obſerve the direction of the heathen, and <hi>follow God,</hi> not prejudge his determination by ours; but in a modeſt ſuſpenſion of our thoughts, <hi>bearken what the Lord God will ſay concerning us, for be will ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his ſaints that they turn not again.</hi>
