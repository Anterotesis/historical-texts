            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FROM the amiable cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have heard of you, both in this country (where I have reÅ¿ided many years in the various Å¿pheres of life) and in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, I am induced to dedicate to you this publication.</p>
            <p>When I laÅ¿t returned to this country, I did myÅ¿elf the honor to wait upon your Excellency, in September, 1796, before your reÅ¿ignation of the PreÅ¿idency of the United States, and preÅ¿ented to you a Poem I compoÅ¿ed upon the <hi>"Rural and Romantic Scenes of</hi> DOWN HILL," near Colerain, Ireland, the Å¿eat of the Earl of BriÅ¿tol, and BiÅ¿hop of the DioceÅ¿e of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donderryâ€”for a copy of which, many of the gentlemen of that country gave me a guinea.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency was Å¿o humane and condeÅ¿cending, as to countenance my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="IV" facs="unknown:031170_0003_0FEAE54AEF161B90"/>
of publiÅ¿hing by Å¿ubÅ¿cription, a Poem, Å¿uited to the then preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of America, for which I obtained above 1200 Å¿ubÅ¿cribers. And your Excellency's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿cending and polite letter, for tranÅ¿mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Poem to you at Mount Vernon, merits By moÅ¿t Å¿incere gratitude.</p>
            <p>The Book now publiÅ¿hed may be uÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all deÅ¿criptions of both Å¿exes, as the times are indeed alarming, and the art of contentment rendered an eÅ¿Å¿ential Å¿tudy of mankind, in purÅ¿uit of <hi>real happineÅ¿s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Å¿hould have done myÅ¿elf the pleaÅ¿ure of waiting on your Excellency, for liberty of addreÅ¿Å¿ing the following TreatiÅ¿e to your patronage, but an indiÅ¿poÅ¿ition, and fear of tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ing on your delicacy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventedâ€”As it is only to gentlemen of Å¿uperior rank and noted abilities, we can look for literary encouragement in any country for promoting learning and Å¿ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. May every encourager of this work join me in fervent prayer to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that every real felicity may ever await your Excellency.</p>
            <p>I have the honor to Å¿ubÅ¿cribe myÅ¿elf, with the moÅ¿t profound reÅ¿pect and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, Sir, Your Excellency's moÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, and obedient humble Servant,</p>

notion, as it is judge of equity and right: in which reÅ¿pect alÅ¿o it gives a clear and peremptory Å¿entence againÅ¿t all mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring impatience. To evince this, I Å¿hall inÅ¿iÅ¿t upon theÅ¿e particulars. <hi>FirÅ¿t,</hi> That God is debtor to man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever he affords to any, it is upon bounty, not of right, a benevolence not a due. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this bounty is not Å¿trait or narrow, confined to Å¿ome few particular perÅ¿ons, and wholly over-Å¿kip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the reÅ¿t, but more or leÅ¿s univerÅ¿al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diffuÅ¿ed to all. So that he who has the leaÅ¿t, cannot juÅ¿tly Å¿ay but he has been liberally dealt with. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That if we compare our bleÅ¿Å¿ings with our allays, our good things with our evil, we will find our good far Å¿urmounting. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That we Å¿hall find them yet more Å¿o, if we compare them with the good we have done; as on the contrary, we Å¿hall find our afflictions Å¿carce diÅ¿cernable if balan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with our Å¿ins. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That as God is rector of the univerÅ¿e, Å¿o it appertains to him to make Å¿uch allotments, Å¿uch diÅ¿tributions as may beÅ¿t preÅ¿erve the Å¿tate of the whole, <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That God not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding that univerÅ¿al care, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o a peculiar aspect on every particular perÅ¿on, and diÅ¿poÅ¿es to him what he diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns beÅ¿t for him in Å¿pecial. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If we compare our adverÅ¿ities with thoÅ¿e
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031170_0020_0FEB136B157EA3C8"/>
of other men, we Å¿hall always find Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that equals, if nnot exceeds our own. All theÅ¿e are certain irrefragable truths, and there is none of them Å¿ingle, but may, if well preÅ¿t upon the mind, charm it into a calmneÅ¿s and reÅ¿ignation; but when there is Å¿uch a conÅ¿piration of arguments, it muÅ¿t be a very obÅ¿tinate perverÅ¿eneÅ¿s that can reÅ¿iÅ¿t them: Or Å¿hould they Å¿ail to enforce a full convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will yet introduce thoÅ¿e Å¿ubÅ¿idiary proofs, which I have to alledge, Å¿o ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouÅ¿ly, as will, being put altogether, amount unto perfect and uncontrollable evidence.</p>

               <head>Of God's AbÅ¿olute Sovereignty.</head>
               <p>THE firÅ¿t propoÅ¿ition that God is deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to no man, is too clear and apparent to require much of illuÅ¿tration: For as he is a free agent, and may act as he pleaÅ¿es, Å¿o he is the Å¿ole proprietary, and can wrongfully detain from none, becauÅ¿e all original right is in himÅ¿elf. This has been Å¿o much acknowledged by the blindeÅ¿t hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that none of them durÅ¿t make inÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent addreÅ¿Å¿es to their gods, challenge any thing of them as of debt, but by Å¿acrifices and prayers owned their dependance and wants, and implored Å¿upplies. And Å¿ure, chriÅ¿tianity teaches us not to be more Å¿au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. If thoÅ¿e deities who owed their very being to their votaries, were yet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the Å¿pring and Å¿ource of all, we can with no pretence deny it to that Å¿uprenÅ¿e power, in <hi>whom we live, move, and have our being,</hi> Acts xvii. 28. For if it were merely an act of his choice to give us a being, all his Å¿ubÅ¿equent bounties can have no other original than his own good pleaÅ¿ure. We could put no obligation upon God before we were; and when we began to be, we were his creatures, and Å¿o by the moÅ¿t indiÅ¿putable right owe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to him, but can have no antecedent
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031170_0022_0FEB136F8E351D90"/>
title on which to claim any thing from him: So that the apoÅ¿tle might well make the challenge which he doth on God's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, <hi>Who hath given any thing unto him, and it Å¿hall be recompenced to him again?</hi> Rom. xi. 35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now ordinary diÅ¿cretion teaches us, not to be too bold in our expectation from one to whom we can plead no right. It has as little of prudence as modeÅ¿ty, to preÅ¿s impudently upon the bounty of a patron, and does but give him temptation (at leaÅ¿t pretence) to deny. And if it be thus with men, who poÅ¿Å¿ibly may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times have an intereÅ¿t, Å¿ometimes a vanity to oblige: it muÅ¿t be much more Å¿o to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, who cannot be in want of us, and therefore need not buy us: <hi>Our good,</hi> as the PÅ¿almiÅ¿t Å¿peaks, <hi>extends not to him,</hi> PÅ¿al. xvi. 2. He has fundamental right in that little we are, which will Å¿tand good tho' it Å¿hould never be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated by greater benefits. With what an humble baÅ¿hfulneÅ¿s should we then Å¿ue for any thing, who have no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to invite the leaÅ¿t donation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already Å¿o pre-engaged, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mortgage Å¿o much as ourÅ¿elves in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ideration of any new favor? And Å¿urely, extravagant hopes do very ill befit people in this condition. We Å¿ee the modeÅ¿ty
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031170_0023_0FEB1372623F1318"/>
of good <hi>MephiboÅ¿heth,</hi> tho' he was by a Å¿landerous accuÅ¿ation outed of half the eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>David</hi> given him, yet upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection that he derived it all from his good pleaÅ¿ure, diÅ¿puted not the Å¿entence, but cheerfully reÅ¿igned to the Å¿ame diÅ¿poÅ¿ure, from which he received it, Å¿aying, <hi>Yea, let him take all,</hi> 2 Sam, xix. 30. A rare example, and fit for imitation, as being adapted to the preÅ¿ent caÅ¿e, not only in that one circumÅ¿tance of his having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived all from the king, but alÅ¿o in that of the attainder of his blood: which he confeÅ¿Å¿es in the former part of the 28th verÅ¿e, <hi>For all of my father's houÅ¿e were but dead men before my Lord.</hi> And alas! may we not Å¿ay the very Å¿ame? Was not our whole race tainted in our firÅ¿t parent? So that if God had not the primary title of vaÅ¿Å¿alage, he would in our fall have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that of confiÅ¿cation and eÅ¿cheat. And can we think ourÅ¿elves then in terms to capitulate, and make our own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and expect God Å¿hould humour us in all our wild demands?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is indeed to keep up that old rebellion of our progenitor, for that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿ted in a diÅ¿content with that portion God had aÅ¿Å¿igned him, and coveting what he had reÅ¿trained him. Nay indeed it comes up to the height of the devil's propoÅ¿al,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031170_0024_0FEB1376561267E8"/>
the attempting <hi>to be as God,</hi> Gen. iii. 5. For 'tis an endeavor to wreÅ¿t the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of his hands, to Å¿upercede his authority of diÅ¿penÅ¿ing to us, and to carve for ourÅ¿elves. This is Å¿o mad an inÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that were it poÅ¿ible to Å¿tate a caÅ¿e exactly parallel between man and man, it would raiÅ¿e the indignation of any that but pretended to ingenuity. Yet this is, without hyperbole, the true meaning of every murmuring repining thought we entertain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But as bad as it is, who is there of us, that can in this particular Å¿ay, <hi>We have made our hearts clean?</hi> Prov. xx. 9. 'Tis true we make Å¿ome formal acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment Å¿ometimes that we receive all from God's gift: CuÅ¿tom teaches us from our infancy, after every meal we eat, to give him thanks (though even that is now thought too much reÅ¿pect, and begins to be diÅ¿carded as unfaÅ¿hionable:) yet Å¿ure he cannot be thought to do that in earneÅ¿t, that has all the time of his eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been grumbling that his table abounds not with Å¿uch delicacies as his neigbors. And yet at this rate God knows are moÅ¿t of our thanÅ¿kgivings. Indeed we have not Å¿o much ordinary civility to God, as we have to men. The common proverb
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031170_0025_0FEB1377F8DBF050"/>
teaches us, not to pry too curiouÅ¿ly into the blemiÅ¿hes of what is given us; but on God's gifts we fit as cenÅ¿ors, nicely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine every thing which is in any way diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to our fancies, and as if we dealt with him under the notion of chapmen, diÅ¿parage it, as <hi>Solomon</hi> Å¿ays, buyers uÅ¿e to do, <hi>It is naught, it is naught Å¿aith the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> Prov. xx. 14. Nay we Å¿eem yet more abÅ¿urdly to change the Å¿cene, and as if God were to make oblations to us, we as critically obÅ¿erve the detects of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, as the Levitical prieÅ¿ts were to do thoÅ¿e of the Å¿acrifice, and (like angry Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) Å¿cornfully reject, whatever does not perfectly anÅ¿wer our wanton appetites.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And now, Å¿hould God take us at our words, withdraw all thoÅ¿e bleÅ¿Å¿ings which we Å¿o faÅ¿tidiouÅ¿ly deÅ¿piÅ¿e, what a condition were we in? Tis Å¿ure we have nothing to plead in reverÅ¿e of that Judgment. There is nothing in it againÅ¿t juÅ¿tice; for he takes but his own. This he intimates to IÅ¿real, HoÅ¿. ii. 9. <hi>I will return and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the Å¿eaÅ¿on thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax;</hi> In which he aÅ¿Å¿erts his own property, <hi>My corn, my wine,</hi> &amp;c. and recalls them to the remembrance that they were but uÅ¿ufructuaries. And 'tis as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that our tenure is but the same. Nay this proceeding would not be repugnant
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031170_0026_0FEB137AC6CE0508"/>
even to mercy, for even that is not obliged Å¿till to proÅ¿titute itÅ¿elf to our contempt. I am Å¿ure Å¿uch a toleration is beyond all the meaÅ¿ures of human lenity. Should any of us offer an alms to an indigent wretch, and he when he Å¿ees 'tis Å¿ilver, Å¿hould murmur and exclaim that it is not gold, would we not draw back our hand, and reÅ¿erve our charity for a more worthy object? 'Tis true indeed, God's thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor our narrow bowels equal meaÅ¿ures for the devine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paÅ¿Å¿ion; and we experimentally find that his long-Å¿uffering infinitely exceeds ours; yet we know he does in the parable of the lord and the Å¿ervant, <hi>Matt. xxviii.</hi> declare, that he will proportion his mercy by ours, in that inÅ¿tance; and we have no promiÅ¿e that he will not do it in this; nay we have all reaÅ¿on to expect he Å¿hould: For Å¿ince his wiÅ¿dom prompts him to do nothing in vain, and all his bounty to us is deÅ¿igned to make us happy, when he Å¿ees that end utterly fruÅ¿trated by our diÅ¿contents, to what purpoÅ¿e Å¿hould he continue that to which we will be never the better for?</p>
               <p n="6">6. BeÅ¿ides tho' he be exceedingly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, yet he is not negligent or inÅ¿enÅ¿ible; he takes particular notice, not only with what diligence we employ, but with what affections we reÅ¿ent every of his bleÅ¿Å¿ings.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031170_0027_0FEB137D9549A948"/>
And as ingratitude is a voice odious to man Å¿o it is extremely provoking to God; Å¿o that in this Å¿enÅ¿e alÅ¿o, the words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour are moÅ¿t true, <hi>From him that hath not (i. e.)</hi> that hath not a grateful Å¿enÅ¿e and value, <hi>Å¿hall be taken away even that he hath</hi> Mat. xxv. 29. But we may find a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this kind, more expreÅ¿s to IÅ¿real. <hi>BecauÅ¿e thou Å¿ervedÅ¿t not the Lord thy God with gladneÅ¿s, and with joyfulneÅ¿s of heart, for the abundance of all things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Å¿hall thou Å¿erve thine enemies, whom the Lord God will Å¿end among thee, in hunger, and in thirÅ¿t, and in nakedneÅ¿s, and in want of all things,</hi> Deut. xxviii. 27. A Å¿ad and diÅ¿mal inverÅ¿ion, yet founded wholly in the want of that cheerful recognition which God expected from them. And if IÅ¿rael, the lot of his inheritance, that people whom he had Å¿ingled out from all the nations of the world, could thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his favor by unthankfulneÅ¿s, Å¿ure none of us can Å¿uppoÅ¿e we have any Å¿urer entail of it. In a word, as God loves a cheerful giver, Å¿o he alÅ¿o loves a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful receiver; one that complies with his end in beÅ¿towing, by taking a juÅ¿t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placence in his gifts. But the querulous and unÅ¿atisfied, reproach his bounty; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿e him of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. If therefore ingenuity and gratitude cannot, yet at leaÅ¿t let prudence and Å¿elf-love engage us againÅ¿t this Å¿in of <hi>Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which we Å¿ee does abundantly juÅ¿tify the character the wiÅ¿e man gives, when he tells us, '<hi>tis unprofitable,</hi> WiÅ¿d. i. 11, he might have Å¿aid pernicious alÅ¿o; for Å¿o it evidently is in it's effects. Let us then arm ourÅ¿elves againÅ¿t it, and to that purpoÅ¿e impreÅ¿s deeply upon our minds the preÅ¿ent conÅ¿ideration. That God owes us nothing, and that whatever we receive is an alms, and not a tribute. <hi>Diogenes</hi> being aÅ¿ked what wine drank the moÅ¿t pleaÅ¿ant, anÅ¿wered, That which is drank at another's coÅ¿t. And this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumÅ¿tance we can never miÅ¿s of to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend our good things to us: For be they little or much, they come <hi>gratis.</hi> When therefore in a pettiÅ¿h mood we find ourÅ¿elves apt to charge God fooliÅ¿hly, and to think him Å¿trait-handed towards us, let us imagine we hear God expoÅ¿tulating with us, as the houÅ¿holder in the parable, <hi>

Let us leave off preÅ¿cribing to God (which no ingenious man would do to an earthly benefactor) and Å¿et us betake ourÅ¿elves to a more holy and Å¿ucceÅ¿sful policy, the acknowledgment of paÅ¿t mercies, and our own unworthineÅ¿s. This was <hi>Jacob's</hi> method, <hi>I am not worthy of the leaÅ¿t of all the mercies, and of all the truth which thou haÅ¿t Å¿hewed unto thy Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: for with my Å¿taff I paÅ¿Å¿ed over this Jordan and now I am become two bands;</hi> and with this humble preface he introduces his petition for reÅ¿cue in his preÅ¿ent diÅ¿treÅ¿s, <hi>Deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my brother,</hi> &amp;c. Gen. xxx. 10, 11. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent pattern of divine rhetoric, which the Å¿ucceÅ¿s demonÅ¿trates to have been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry prevalent. And we cannot tranÅ¿cribe better copy, to render our deÅ¿ires as Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿sful. Indeed we are Å¿o utterly deÅ¿titute of all arguments from ourÅ¿elves, that we
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031170_0030_0FEB138611034538"/>
can make no reaÅ¿onable form of addreÅ¿s, if we found it not in Å¿omething of God; and there is nothing even in him adapted to our purpoÅ¿e, but his mercy: nor can that be Å¿o advantageouÅ¿ly urged by any thing, as by the former inÅ¿tances it has given of itÅ¿elf: for as God only is fit to be a precedent to himÅ¿elf, Å¿o he loves to be Å¿o.

But Å¿urely <hi>God does not leave himÅ¿elf without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s,</hi> Acts xiv. 17. even in Å¿ecular things; there is no man breathing but has Å¿ome bleÅ¿Å¿ings of his left hand, as well as his right, as I have already mentioned: and unleÅ¿s it be Å¿ome few prodigies of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in whoÅ¿e puniÅ¿hment or patience God deÅ¿igns Å¿ignally to glorify himÅ¿elf, there are none who enjoy not greater comforts of life than thoÅ¿e they want, I mean Å¿uch as are really greater, though perhaps, to their prejudicate fancies they do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Å¿o. Thus in point of health, if a man be diÅ¿affected in one part, yet all the reÅ¿t of his body may be (and often is) well; or if he have a complication, and have more than one diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, yet there is no man that has all, or half Å¿o many as are incident to human bodies, Å¿o that he is comparatively more healthy than Å¿ick. So again it is not very common for a man to loÅ¿e a limb, or Å¿enÅ¿e; the generality of them keep them to their laÅ¿t; and they who do, have in that an overbalance to moÅ¿t out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adverÅ¿ities; and even they who are Å¿o unhappy to loÅ¿t one, yet commonly keep the reÅ¿t, at leaÅ¿t the major part: or if at any time any man is left a mere breathing trunk, yet it is by Å¿uch Å¿tupify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diÅ¿eaÅ¿es as deaden the Å¿enÅ¿es, or Å¿uch mortal ones as Å¿oon take them away; and

Å¿o the remedy overtakes the malady. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides it pleaÅ¿es God very often to make compenÅ¿ation for the want of one member or faculty by improving the uÅ¿e of another. We have Å¿een feel Å¿upply all the neceÅ¿Å¿ary uÅ¿es of hands, to thoÅ¿e that have had none; and it is a thing of daily obÅ¿ervation that men that are blind, have their intellects more vigorous and active, by their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tractions from viÅ¿ible objects.</p>

               <p>I have now inÅ¿tanced in the three moÅ¿t general concerns of human life, the body, goods, and fame, to which heads may be reduced moÅ¿t of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions incident to our outward Å¿tate, as far as immediately concern ourÅ¿elves. But their is no man Å¿tands Å¿o Å¿ingle in the world, but has Å¿ome relations or friends, in which he thinks himÅ¿elf interereÅ¿ted, and many times thoÅ¿e oblique Å¿trokes which wound us through them, are as painful as the more direct; yet here alÅ¿o God is ordinarily pleaÅ¿ed to provide Å¿ome allays, if we would but take notice of
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031170_0072_0FEEDED907482E78"/>
them. He who has had one friend die, has ordinarily divers others Å¿urviving; or if he have not that, uÅ¿ually God raiÅ¿es him up others. 'Tis true we cannot have a Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of fathers and mothers, yet we often have of other friends that are no leÅ¿s helpful to us: And indeed there are Å¿carce in any thing more remarkable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Providence, than in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. <hi>He that is able out of Å¿tones to raiÅ¿e up children to Abraham,</hi> Matth. iii. 9. does many times by as unexpected a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction Å¿upply friends to the deÅ¿olate. But we do Å¿ometimes loÅ¿e our friends while they are living, they withdraw their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s which is the Å¿oul of friendÅ¿hip: And if this happen by our own demerit, we can accuÅ¿e neither God nor them for it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> nor can we rationally expect that God will provide Å¿upplies, when we wilfully deÅ¿poil ourÅ¿elves. But when they are unkind without provocation, then is the Å¿eaÅ¿on for his interpoÅ¿ition, who uÅ¿es to take up <hi>thoÅ¿e whom father and mother forÅ¿ake,</hi> PÅ¿al. xxvii. 10. And we frequently Å¿ee Å¿ignal proofs of his care in exciting the compaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions of other friends and relatives, or perhaps of mere Å¿trangers. Nay Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God makes the inhumanity of a man's relations, the occaÅ¿ion of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Thus the barbarous malice of
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031170_0073_0FEEDEA05F48CA00"/>
JoÅ¿eph's brethren was the fiÅ¿t Å¿tep to his dominion over Egypt. And it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon obÅ¿ervation in families, that the moÅ¿t diÅ¿countenanced child oft makes better proof, than the darling.</p>
               <p n="10">10. We are yet liable to a third afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the calamity of our friends, which by the Å¿ympathy of kindneÅ¿s preÅ¿Å¿es us no leÅ¿s (perhaps more) Å¿enÅ¿ibly than our own: But then it is to be conÅ¿idered, that theirs are capable of the Å¿ame allaying circumÅ¿tances that ours are, and God has the Å¿ame arts of alleviating their burdens; Å¿o that we have the Å¿ame arguments for acquieÅ¿cence in their Å¿ufferings that we have in our own, and Å¿hall do a more friendly office in impreÅ¿Å¿ing thoÅ¿e upon them, than in the moÅ¿t paÅ¿Å¿ionate adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Å¿orrows.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The laÅ¿t and greateÅ¿t diÅ¿comfort from friends, is that of that of their own: And if ever we may be allowed that diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conÅ¿olate Å¿train of the Prophet, IÅ¿a. xxii. 4. <hi>Look away from me, I will weep bitterly, labour not to comfort me;</hi> this Å¿eems to be the time: Yet even this <hi>valley of Achor is not without a door of hope,</hi> HoÅ¿. ii. 15. A vicious perÅ¿on may be recalled, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes have been; Å¿o that as long as God continues life, we ought no more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ite
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031170_0074_0FEEDEA1F1FBC6C0"/>
our hope than to quit our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. BeÅ¿ides there are few that make this complaint that have not Å¿omething to balance, or at leaÅ¿t to lighten it. I Å¿hall inÅ¿tance in that relation which is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t and moÅ¿t tender, that of a parent. He that has one bad child may have divers good. If he have but one virtuous it is a very great mercy, and it is another that he may be the better taught to value it by the oppoÅ¿ition of the contrary. But if any be Å¿o unhappy as to have many chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and <hi>all to conÅ¿ume his eyes and grieve his heart.</hi> 2 Sam. ii. 33. it may be a Å¿ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onable reflection for him to examine how far he has contributed to it, either by <hi>Eli's</hi> fond indulgence, or by a remiÅ¿s and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿s education; or which is worÅ¿t of all, by his moÅ¿t impious example. If any, or all of thoÅ¿e be found the cauÅ¿e, he is not Å¿o much to Å¿eek for allays to his grief, as for pardon of his Å¿in: And when he has penitently retracted his own fault, he may then have better ground of hope that God may reform thoÅ¿e of his children. In the mean time he may look on his own afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them as God's diÅ¿cipline on him, and gather at leaÅ¿t this comfort from it, that his heavenly Father has more care of him, than he had of his, and does not leave him uncorrected.</p>

12. Thus we Å¿ee in all the concerns (which are the moÅ¿t common and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of human life, and wherein the juÅ¿teÅ¿t of our complaints are uÅ¿ually founded) there is Å¿uch a temperature and mixture, that the good does more than equal the ill, and not only in the groÅ¿Å¿er bulk, when our whole Å¿tate is weighed together, but in every Å¿ingle branch of it; God having herein dealt with this little world man, as he has done with the greater, wherein he is obÅ¿erved to have furniÅ¿hed every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with Å¿pecific remedies for their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar diÅ¿eaÅ¿es. I have only given theÅ¿e Å¿hort hints by way of eÅ¿Å¿ay and pattern for the Reader's contemplation, which when he Å¿hall have extended to all thoÅ¿e minute particulars wherein he is eÅ¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concerned, more curiouÅ¿ly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his Å¿ufferings with his allays and comforts, I cannot doubt but he will own himÅ¿elf an inÅ¿tance of the truth of the preÅ¿ent theÅ¿is, and confeÅ¿s, that he has much more cauÅ¿e of thankfulneÅ¿s than complaint.</p>
               <p n="13">13. This I Å¿ay, Å¿uppoÅ¿ing his afflictions to be of thoÅ¿e more Å¿olid and conÅ¿iderable Å¿orts I have before mentioned. But how many are there who have few or none of Å¿uch, who Å¿eem to be Å¿eated in the land of <hi>GoÅ¿hen,</hi> in a place exempt from all the
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031170_0076_0FEEDEA7E6951340"/>
plagues that infect their neighbours? And thoÅ¿e, one would think, Å¿hould give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy vote to this concluÅ¿ion, as having no temptation to reÅ¿iÅ¿t it; yet I doubt it is far otherwiÅ¿e, that Å¿uch men are of all the moÅ¿t unÅ¿atisfied. For though they have no croÅ¿Å¿es of God's impoÅ¿ing, they uÅ¿ually create a multitude to themÅ¿elves. And here we may Å¿ay with <hi>David, It is better to full into the hand of God, than into the hand of man.</hi> 2 Sam. xxiv. 14. It is eaÅ¿ier to bear the afflictions God Å¿ends, than thoÅ¿e we make to ourÅ¿elves. His are limited both for quantity and quality, but our own are as boundleÅ¿s as thoÅ¿e extravagant deÅ¿ires from which they Å¿pring.</p>
               <p n="14">14. And this is the true cauÅ¿e why Contentment is Å¿o much a Å¿tranger to thoÅ¿e who have all the outward cauÅ¿es of it, they have not definite meaÅ¿ure of their deÅ¿ires; it is not the Å¿upply of all their real wants will Å¿erve their turn, their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites are precarious, and depend upon contingencies. They hunger not becauÅ¿e they are empty, but becauÅ¿e others are full. Many a man could have liked his own portion well enough, had he not Å¿een another have Å¿omething he liked better. Nay even the moÅ¿t inconÅ¿iderable things
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031170_0077_0FEEDEA9819FC580"/>
acquire a value by being anothers, when we deÅ¿piÅ¿e much greater of our own. <hi>Ahab</hi> might well have Å¿atisfied himÅ¿elf with the kingdom of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> had not <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both's</hi> poor plot lain in his eye. But Å¿o raving were his deÅ¿ires after it, that he diÅ¿reliÅ¿hes all the pomps of a crown, yea the ordinary refreÅ¿hment of nature, <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And how many are there now at this day whoÅ¿e clothes fit uneaÅ¿y, if they Å¿ee another have had but the luck to be a little more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouÅ¿ly vain; whoÅ¿e meat is unÅ¿avoury if they have Å¿een but a greater rarity, a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cookery at another's table; in a word, who make other peoples exceÅ¿Å¿es the Å¿tandard of their own felicities.</p>

The proud man Å¿o longs for homage and adoration, that nothing can pleaÅ¿e him if that be wanting. <hi>Human</hi> can find no guÅ¿t in all the Å¿enÅ¿ualities of the <hi>PerÅ¿ian</hi> court, becauÅ¿e a poor deÅ¿picable <hi>Jew</hi> denies his obeiÅ¿ance, EÅ¿th. v. 13.

but by violating his Å¿iÅ¿ter's honour, 2 Sam. xiii. 14.

And thus every one of our paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions keeps us upon the rack till they have obtained their deÅ¿igns. Nay when they have, the very emptineÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e acquiÅ¿itions is a new torment, and puts us upon freÅ¿h purÅ¿uits. Thus between the impetuouÅ¿neÅ¿s of our deÅ¿ires, and the emptineÅ¿s of our enjoyments, we Å¿till <hi>diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ourÅ¿elves in vain,</hi> PÅ¿al. xxxix. 6. And whilÅ¿t we have Å¿uch cruel taÅ¿k-maÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it is not Å¿trange to find us groaning under our burdens. If we will indulge all our vicious or fooliÅ¿h appetites, think our lives bound up with them, and Å¿olicit the Å¿atisfaction of them with as impatient a vehemence, as <hi>Rachel</hi> did for children, Gen, xxx. 4. <hi>Give me them or I die;</hi> no wonder that we are always complaining of diÅ¿appointments, Å¿ince in theÅ¿e the very Å¿ucceÅ¿s is a defeat, and is but the exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pain of a craving ravenous Å¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, for that of a cloyed and nauÅ¿eated. Indeed men of this temper condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to a perpetual reÅ¿tleÅ¿sneÅ¿s, they are like phantaÅ¿tic mutineers, who when their Å¿uperiors Å¿end them blanks to write their

               <p n="16">16. But in the mean time how unjuÅ¿tly do they accuÅ¿e God of illiberality, becauÅ¿e every thing anÅ¿wers not their humour? He has made them reaÅ¿onable creatures, and has provided them Å¿atisfactions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their nature; but if they will have wild irrational expectations, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his wiÅ¿dom, nor his goodneÅ¿s is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to Å¿atisfy thoÅ¿e. His Å¿upplies are real and Å¿olid, and therefore have no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿pondence to imaginary wants. If we will create Å¿uch to ourÅ¿elves, why do we not create an imaginary Å¿atisfaction to them? It were the merrier frenzy of the two, to be like the mad <hi>Athenian,</hi> that thought all the Å¿hips that came into the harbour his own: And it were better, <hi>Ixion</hi> like, to have our arms filled with a cloud, than to have them perpetually beating our own breaÅ¿ts, and be Å¿till tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ourÅ¿elves with inÅ¿atiable deÅ¿ires. Yet this is the Å¿tate to which men volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily Å¿ubject themÅ¿elves, and then quarrel at God becauÅ¿e they will not let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves be happy. But Å¿ure their very complaints juÅ¿tify God, and argue that

he has dealt very kindly with them, and afforded them all the neceÅ¿Å¿ary accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of life: For did they want them, they would not be Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible of the want of the other. He that is at perfect eaÅ¿e may feel with Å¿ome vexation the biting of flea or gnat, which would not be at all obÅ¿ervable if he were upon the rack. And Å¿hould God change the Å¿cene, and make theÅ¿e nice people feel the deÅ¿titution of neceÅ¿Å¿aries; all theÅ¿e regrets about Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities would be overwhelmed. In the mean time how deplorable a thing is it, that we are Å¿till the poorer for God's bounty, that those to whom he has open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand wideÅ¿t, Å¿hould open their mouth Å¿o too, in outcries and murmurs?

3. And here certainly <hi>every mouth muÅ¿t be Å¿topped, and all the world become guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God,</hi> Rom. iii. 19. For alas! who is there can Å¿ay his obedience has been in any degree proportionable to his obligation? It is manifeÅ¿t we have all received abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly from God's hand, but what has he had from ours? I may challenge the beÅ¿t man, to caÅ¿t up the account of his beÅ¿t day, and tell me whether his receivings have not infinitely exceeded his diÅ¿burÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whether for any one good thing he has done, he has not received many. Nor is the diÅ¿parity only in number, but much more in value. God's works are perfect, all he does for us, like the firÅ¿t Å¿ix days productions, <hi>all are very good,</hi> Gen. i. but alas! our very <hi>righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s is as filthy rags,</hi> IÅ¿a. lxiv. 6. We offer <hi>him the blind and the lame,</hi> Mal. i. 8. a few yawning drowÅ¿y prayers perhaps, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has the leaÅ¿t Å¿hare; the fuller cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of our thoughts, running towards our Å¿ecular or Å¿inful concerns. We drop it may be a Å¿canty alms, wherein it is odds our vain-glory Å¿crambles for a Å¿hare with him, if it do not wholly ingroÅ¿s it. We Å¿it an hour at a Å¿ermon, but it is rather to hear the wit or eloquence of the preacher, than the word of God. Like the duller Å¿ort of animals, we like well to have our itching ears Å¿cratched, but grow Å¿turdy

and reÅ¿tive when we Å¿hould do what we are there taught. In a word, all our Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices at the beÅ¿t are miÅ¿erable, maimed and imperfect; and too often corrupt and unfound. So that God may well upbraid us as he did <hi>IÅ¿rael, Offer it new to thy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, will he be pleaÅ¿ed with it?</hi> Mal. i. 8. TheÅ¿e very iniquities of our holy things, are enough to defeat all our pretence to any good from God's hand. Yet God knows this is much the beÅ¿t Å¿ide of us: It is not every one that can make Å¿o fair an appearance as this amounts to. With many, there is no place to complain of the blemiÅ¿hes of their Å¿acrifices, for they offer none; of whom we may Å¿ay in the words of the PÅ¿almiÅ¿t, <hi>God is not in all their thoughts,</hi> PÅ¿al. x. 4. I fear there want not thoÅ¿e who drive away the day, the week, nay the year, without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring in whoÅ¿e <hi>hand their time is,</hi> PÅ¿al. xxxi. 16. or paying him any Å¿olemn tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of it; who enjoy the Å¿ervices of all inferior creatures, without conÅ¿idering that theirs are more due to the Å¿upreme Lord: In a word, who live as if they were abÅ¿olutely independent; had their exiÅ¿tence purely from themÅ¿elves, and had no Creator to whom they owed their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or any conÅ¿equent duty. And Å¿ure men who thus diÅ¿card themÅ¿elves from God's family, have very little reaÅ¿on to
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031170_0090_0FEC87A6AB404FB8"/>
expect the proviÅ¿ions of it: Yet even Å¿uch as theÅ¿e have the impudence to complain, if any things be wanting to their needs (Å¿hall I Å¿ay) or to their luÅ¿ts; can raving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profane God's name in their impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiencies, which they know not how to uÅ¿e in their prayers; as if the Deity were conÅ¿iderable in no other notion, than that of their caterer or Å¿teward.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If now we Å¿eriouÅ¿ly reflect, what can be more admirable than that infinite pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God, who notwithÅ¿tanding the miÅ¿erable infirmities of the pious, and the lewd contempt of the impious, Å¿till goes on reÅ¿olutely in his bounty, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to all mankind Å¿ome, and to Å¿ome all his temporal bleÅ¿Å¿ings? He has no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juÅ¿tice to do Å¿o, for it is no part of his compact; he has none of gratitude, for he is perpetually affronted and diÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged. Surely we may well Å¿ay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Is this after the manner of men, O Lord,</hi> I Chron. xvii. 17. Can the higheÅ¿t hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man indulgence bear any proportion with this divine clemency?

creatures? For us who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited our right to all, and yet by mere fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour are Å¿till kept in the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of many great bleÅ¿Å¿ings; for us to grow mutinous, becauÅ¿e there is perhaps Å¿omething more trifling which is denied us, is Å¿uch a Å¿tupid ingratitude, as one would think impoÅ¿Å¿ible to human nature. Should a tenant with us have at once forfeited his leaÅ¿e, and maliciouÅ¿ly affronted his landlord, he would Å¿ure think himÅ¿elf very gently dealt with, if he were Å¿uffered to enjoy but a part of his firÅ¿t eÅ¿tate; but we Å¿hould think him not only inÅ¿olent, but mad, who when the whole were left him, Å¿hould quarrel and clamour if he might not have his cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage adorned with marble floors, and gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed roofs. Yet at this wild rate we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have ourÅ¿elves to our great Landlord, grow pettiÅ¿h and angry if we have not every thing we can fancy, though we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy many more uÅ¿eful, merely by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. And can there be any thing imagined more unreaÅ¿onable? Let us therefore, if not for piety, yet at leaÅ¿t to juÅ¿tify our claim to rationality, be more ingenuous; let us not conÅ¿ult only with our fond appetites, and be thus perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Å¿oliciting this Å¿atisfaction; but rather reflect on what tenure we hold what we already have, even that of Å¿uperabundant mercy; and fear, leaÅ¿t like inÅ¿olent beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars,

by the impudence of our demands, we divert even that charity which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned us. In Å¿hort, let every man, when he computes what he wants of his deÅ¿ires, reckon as exactly how much he is Å¿hort of his duty; and when he has duly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered both, he will think it a very gentle compoÅ¿ition to have the one unÅ¿upplied, Å¿o he may have the other remitted: and will Å¿ee cauÅ¿e contentedly to Å¿it down and Å¿ay with honeÅ¿t <hi>MephiboÅ¿heth, What right have I to cry any more unto the king?</hi> 2 Sam. xix. 28. But if it be thus with us upon the mere Å¿core of our imperfections or omiÅ¿Å¿ions, what an obnoxious Å¿tate do our innumerable actual Å¿ins put us in? If the Å¿pots of our Å¿acrifices are provoking, what are our Å¿acrileges and bold profanations? If thoÅ¿e who neglect or forget God are liÅ¿ted among his enemies, what are thoÅ¿e who avowedly defy him? Indeed he who Å¿oberly conÅ¿iders the world, and Å¿ees how daringly the divine MajeÅ¿ty is daily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted, cannot but wonder that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ions of our manners, thoÅ¿e prodigies in morality, Å¿hould not be anÅ¿wered with as great prodigies in calamity too; that we Å¿hould either have other ruin than that of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or the earth Å¿erve us for any other purpoÅ¿e than to be, as it was to <hi>Korah,</hi> Numb. xvi. 32. our living Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre.</p>

6. Nor is this forbearance of God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervable only towards the maÅ¿s and collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body of mankind, but to every man in particular. Who is there that if he ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ack his conÅ¿cience, Å¿hall not find guilts enough to juÅ¿tify God in the utmoÅ¿t Å¿eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities towards him? So that how much Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his puniÅ¿hments are Å¿hort of that, Å¿o much he evidently owes to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>enity and compaÅ¿Å¿ion of God. And who is there that Å¿uffers in this world the utmoÅ¿t that God can inflict? We have a great many Å¿uffering capacities, and if thoÅ¿e were all filled up to the height, our condition would Å¿carce differ from that of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any thing but duration. But God is more merciful, and never inflicts at that rate on us here. Every man's experience can tell him, that God diÅ¿charges not his whole quiver at once upon him, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts him in many more particulars than he afflicts him; and yet the Å¿ame experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will probably tell moÅ¿t of us, that we are not Å¿o modeÅ¿t in our aÅ¿Å¿aults upon God; we attack him in all his concerns (as far as our feeble malice can reach) in his Å¿overeignty, in his honour, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, nay Å¿ometimes in his very eÅ¿Å¿ence and being. And as they are univerÅ¿al in reÅ¿pect of him, Å¿o alÅ¿o in regard of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves: we engage all our powers in this war, do not only <hi>yield</hi> (as the ApoÅ¿tle

Nor are only the members of our body, but the faculties of our Å¿ouls thus employed; our underÅ¿tandings are buÅ¿ied firÅ¿t in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving Å¿ins, and then excuÅ¿es and diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿es for them; our wills are yet more Å¿turdy rebels, and when the underÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is beat out of all its out-works, yet Å¿ullenly keep their hold in Å¿pite of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; and our affections madly ruÅ¿h on <hi>like the horÅ¿e into the battle,</hi> Jer. viii. 6. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred by nothing of danger, Å¿o there be but Å¿in enough in the attempt.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And now with what face can people that thus purÅ¿ue an hoÅ¿tility, expect that it Å¿hould not be returned to them? Does any man denounce war, and yet expect from his adverÅ¿ary all the careÅ¿Å¿es, the obligements of friendÅ¿hip? Self-defence will prompt even the meekeÅ¿t nature to deÅ¿poil his enemy at leaÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e things which he uÅ¿es, to his annoyance; and if God Å¿hould give way even to that loweÅ¿t degree of anger, where or what were we?

But there is yet farther circumÅ¿tance to be advert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, and is too applicable to many of us, that is, that out Å¿ins are not only the conÅ¿tant meritorious cauÅ¿e of our Å¿uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but they are alÅ¿o very often the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trumental cauÅ¿e alÅ¿o; and produce them not only by way of retaliation from God, but by a natural efficacy. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, he that <hi>loves pleaÅ¿ure. Å¿hall be a poor man,</hi> and that <hi>a whoriÅ¿h woman Å¿hall bring a man to a piece of bread,</hi> Prov. vi. 26. <hi>that he that Å¿its long at the wine, Å¿hall have redneÅ¿s of eyes,</hi> Chap. xxiii. 29, 30. <hi>that the Å¿loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Å¿oul Å¿hall Å¿uffer hunger,</hi> Chap. xix. 15. and all theÅ¿e not by immediate Å¿upernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral infliction from God, but as the proper genuine effects of thoÅ¿e reÅ¿pective vices. Indeed God in his original eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hment of things, has made Å¿o cloÅ¿e a connexion between Å¿in and puniÅ¿hment, that he is not often put to exert his power in any extraordinary way, but may truÅ¿t us to be our own beadles, our own <hi>backÅ¿lidings reprove us,</hi> Jer. ii. 19. <hi>and our iniquities are</hi> of themÅ¿elves enough to <hi>become our ruin.</hi>

No man Å¿ure can be Å¿o mad, as to think God Å¿hould work miracles (diÅ¿unite thoÅ¿e things which nature hath conjoined) only that he may Å¿in at eaÅ¿e, and have none of the conÅ¿equent Å¿mart.

Would any man in his wits tell another he will cut his throat, and then expect he Å¿hould furniÅ¿h him with a knife for it?

               <head>Of God's general Providence.</head>
               <p>WHEN God made the univerÅ¿e, he intended not only to glorify himÅ¿elf in one tranÅ¿ient act of his power, and then leave this great and wonderful production of his, as the <hi>oÅ¿trich her eggs in the wilderneÅ¿s,</hi> Lam. iv. 3. but having drawn it out of its firÅ¿t chaos, he Å¿ecured it from returning thither again, by eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hing as a due Å¿ymmetry of parts, Å¿o alÅ¿o a regular order of motion: Hence it is that the heavens have their conÅ¿tant revolutions, the earth its Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ion of determinate Å¿eaÅ¿ons, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals their alternate courÅ¿e of generation and corruption; and by this wiÅ¿e econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the world after Å¿o many thouÅ¿and years, Å¿eems Å¿till in its Å¿pring and firÅ¿t beauty. But it had been in vain to have thus Å¿ecured the defection of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if man for whoÅ¿e Å¿ake they were made had been excluded from this care. His faculty of reaÅ¿on would have made him but the more fatal inÅ¿trument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion, and taught him the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious ways of diÅ¿turbing the world. <hi>Job</hi> compares him <hi>to the wild aÅ¿Å¿es colt,</hi> Job xi. 12. which takes its range without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to any thing of the common good.
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031170_0105_0FEB1451E3286D60"/>
God has therefore doubly hedged in this unruly creature, made a fence of laws about him (both natural and poÅ¿itive) and beÅ¿ides has taken him into the common circle of his providence, Å¿o that he, as well as the reÅ¿t of the creation, has his particular Å¿tation aÅ¿Å¿igned him; and that not only in reference to other creatures, but himÅ¿elf; has put a difference between one man and another, ordained Å¿everal ranks and claÅ¿Å¿es of men, and endowed them with Å¿pecial and appropriate qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for thoÅ¿e: Å¿tations wherein he has Å¿et them.</p>
               <p n="2">This, as it is a work of infinite wiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in God, Å¿o it is of unÅ¿peakable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to men. Without this regular diÅ¿poÅ¿ure, the world would have been in the Å¿ame confuÅ¿ion which we read of in the hoÅ¿t of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

than he could be in any Å¿tate of diÅ¿cord.</p>
               <p n="3">Were this now well conÅ¿idered, methinks it Å¿hould Å¿ilence all our complaints, and men Å¿hould not be Å¿o vehemently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in what part of the Å¿tructure it pleaÅ¿es the great Architect to put them; for every man is to look on himÅ¿elf only as a Å¿mall parcel of thoÅ¿e materials which God is to put into form. Every Å¿tone is not fit for the corner, not every little rafter for the main beam: The wiÅ¿dom of the MaÅ¿ter-builder is alone to determine that. And Å¿ure there cannot be a more vile contempt of the divine wiÅ¿dom than to diÅ¿pute his choice. Had God wiÅ¿dom enough to contrive this vaÅ¿t and beautiful fabric, and may he not be truÅ¿ted with one of us poor worms? Did he by his <hi>wiÅ¿dom make the heavens, and by his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding Å¿tretch out the clouds;</hi> Prov. iii. 19. and Å¿hall he not know where to place a little lump of figured earth? This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moÅ¿t abÅ¿urd diÅ¿truÅ¿t imaginable, and yet this is really the true meaning of our repining at the condition he has placed us in.</p>
               <p n="4">The truth is, we are Å¿o full of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, that we can Å¿ee nothing beyond it: Every man expects God Å¿hould place him

where he has a mind to be, though by it he diÅ¿compoÅ¿e the whole Å¿cheme of his providence. But though we are are Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿eleÅ¿sly partial, yet God is not Å¿o: He that comprehends at once that whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of mankind, applies himÅ¿elf to the accommodating thoÅ¿e, not the humouring any particular perÅ¿on. <hi>He that hath made the great and the Å¿mall, and careth for all alike,</hi> WiÅ¿d. vi. 7. He is the common Father of mankind, and diÅ¿poÅ¿es things for the public advantage of this great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and it is not all the impatient crav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a froward child that Å¿hall make him recede from his deÅ¿igned method. We are apt enough, I am Å¿ure, to tax it not only as a weakneÅ¿s, but injuÅ¿tice too in a prince, when he indulges any thing to a private favourite to the public diÅ¿advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yet Å¿o unequal are we, that we murmur at God for not doing that which we murmur at men for doing.</p>
               <p n="5">BeÅ¿ides a man is to conÅ¿ider, that other men have the Å¿ame appetites with himÅ¿elf. If he diÅ¿like an inferior Å¿tate, why Å¿hould he not think others do Å¿o too? and then as the wiÅ¿e man Å¿peaks, <hi>WhoÅ¿e voice Å¿hall the Lord hear?</hi> Ecclus. xxxiv. 24. It is Å¿ure great inÅ¿olence in me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God Å¿hould be more concerned to humour me, than thoÅ¿e multitudes of

                  </gap>Å¿s in reaÅ¿on Å¿hould be my hopes; for mutiny is no Å¿uch endearing quality as to render any man a darling to God. But if all men Å¿hould have equal Å¿atisfactions, we Å¿hould puzzle even Omnipotence it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf. Every man would be above and Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, yet thoÅ¿e are comparative terms; and if no man were below, no man could be above. So in wealth, moÅ¿t men deÅ¿ire more, but every man does at leaÅ¿t deÅ¿ire to keep what he has; how then Å¿hall one part of the world be Å¿upplied without the diminution of the other, unleÅ¿s there Å¿hould be as miraculous a multiplication of treaÅ¿ure for a man's avarice, as there was of loaves for their hunger, Matth. xvi. 9. It was a good anÅ¿wer which the ambaÅ¿Å¿adors of an oppreÅ¿t province made to <hi>Anthony,</hi> 
                  <q>If, O emperor, thou wilt have double taxes from us, thou muÅ¿t help us to double Å¿prings and harveÅ¿ts.</q> And Å¿ure God muÅ¿t be at the expence of a new creation, make us a double world, if he Å¿hould oblige himÅ¿elf to Å¿atisfy all the unreaÅ¿onable appetites of men: And if he Å¿atisfy not all, why Å¿hould any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perÅ¿on look that his alone Å¿hould be indulged to him?</p>

6. Yet as unreaÅ¿onable at it is, the moÅ¿t of us do betray Å¿uch a perÅ¿uaÅ¿ion. No man is diÅ¿contented that there are lower, as well as higher degrees in the world, that there are poor as well as rich, but all Å¿enÅ¿ible men aÅ¿Å¿ent to the fitneÅ¿s of it; yet if themÅ¿elves happen to be Å¿et in the lower form, they exclaim as if the whole order of the world were Å¿ubverted; which is a palpable indication that they think that Providence which governs others Å¿hould Å¿erve them, and diÅ¿tribute to them not what it, but themÅ¿elves think good. This immoderate Å¿elf-love is the Å¿pring and root of moÅ¿t of our complaints, makes us Å¿uch unequal judges in our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and prompts us to put in caveats and exceptions on our own behalf, as <hi>David</hi> did on his Å¿on's, <hi>See that thou hurt not the young man AbÅ¿alom,</hi> 2 Sam. xviii. 5. as if God were to manage the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world with a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to our liking, and were like the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels at <hi>Sodom,</hi> Gen. xix. 22. to <hi>do nothing till we had got into Zoar,</hi> had all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Å¿ecured to us.</p>
               <p n="7">It would indeed aÅ¿toniÅ¿h a conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man to Å¿ee, that although the concerns of men are all diÅ¿poÅ¿ed by an unerring WiÅ¿dom, and acknowledged by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to be Å¿o, yet that Å¿carce any man
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031170_0110_0FEB145F0CE00540"/>
is pleaÅ¿ed. The truth is, we have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in us the worÅ¿er part of the Leveler's principle, and tho we can very content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly behold multitudes below us, yet are impatient to Å¿ee any above us; not only the <hi>foot</hi> (to uÅ¿e the ApoÅ¿tle's Å¿imile) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains that it is not the hand, but the ear becauÅ¿e it is not the eye,</hi> 1 Cor. xii. 15, 16. Not only the lowermoÅ¿t, but the higher ranks of men are uneaÅ¿y, if there be any one Å¿tep above them. Nay Å¿o importunate is this aÅ¿piring humour, that we Å¿ee men are forced to Å¿eed it, though but with air and Å¿hadows. He that cannot make any real advance in his quality, will yet do it in effigies, in all little gayeties and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantries of it. Every degree in theÅ¿e re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pects not only emulates, but imitates its Å¿uperior, till at laÅ¿t by that impatience of their proper diÅ¿tance they make it greater, and Å¿ink even below their firÅ¿t Å¿tate by their ridiculous profuÅ¿ion. Indeed the world Å¿eems to be Å¿o over-run with this vanity, that there is little viÅ¿ible diÅ¿tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the degrees, and one had need go to the herald's office to know men's qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, for neither their habit nor equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page do now-a-days inform us with any certainty.</p>
               <p n="8">But by all this it appears, that men look on themÅ¿elves only as Å¿ingle perÅ¿ons,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031170_0111_0FEB146201870D60"/>
without reference to the community whereof they are members. For did they conÅ¿ider that, they would endeavour ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to become the places wherein they were Å¿et, by doing the duties belonging to them, than be perpetually projecting for a change. A tree that is every year tranÅ¿planted, will never bear fruit, and a mind that is always hurried from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Å¿tation, will Å¿carce ever do good in any. This is excellently expreÅ¿Å¿ed to us by <hi>Solomon, As a bird that wandereth from his neÅ¿t, Å¿o is a man that wandereth from his place,</hi> Prov. xxvii. 8.

It is evident, this perverÅ¿e temper of mankind breeds a great deal of miÅ¿chief and diÅ¿turbance in the world, but would breed arrant confuÅ¿ion and Å¿ubverÅ¿ion, if it were Å¿uffered to have its full range. If God permit but one ambitious Å¿pirit to break looÅ¿e in an age, as the inÅ¿trument of his wrath, what deÅ¿truction does it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times make?

And firÅ¿t, it is one of the moÅ¿t awakening calls to repentance; and to this end it is that God moÅ¿t uÅ¿ually deÅ¿igns it. We Å¿ee the whole Å¿cene of it.

               <p n="2">And as afflictions do in general ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniÅ¿h us of Å¿ins, Å¿o it pleaÅ¿es God moÅ¿t frequently Å¿o to model and frame them, that they bear the very image and impreÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e particular guilts they are to chaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿e, and are the dark Å¿hadows that attend our gay delights, or fragrant inÅ¿olence.

               <p n="3">Now if we rightly weigh this, we cannot but think it a very advantageous circumÅ¿tance. We are naturally blind, when we look inward, and if we have not Å¿ome adventitious light to clear the object,

The body of Å¿in will not be deÅ¿troyed in the whole entire bulk, but muÅ¿t be diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, pulled to pieces limb by limb. He that attacks it otherwiÅ¿e, will be like <hi>Sertorius's,</hi> Å¿oldier, who ineffectively tug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the horÅ¿e's tail to get it off at once, when he that pulled it hair by hair quickly did it. Therefore as it a great part of our Å¿piritual wiÅ¿dom to know in what eÅ¿pecial parts the <hi>SampÅ¿on</hi> like Å¿trength of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions lie, Å¿o it is a great inÅ¿tance of God's care of us, thus by his corrections to diÅ¿cipline and inÅ¿truct us in it.</p>
               <p n="4">In all our afflictions therefore it is our concern, nicely and critically to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve them. I mean not to enhance our murmurs and complaints, but to learn by them what is God's peculiar controverÅ¿y againÅ¿t us. This is indeed <hi>to bear the rod, and who hath appointed it,</hi> Mic. vi. 9. Let him therefore that Å¿uffers in any of his concerns, examine whether he have not Å¿ome guilt which anÅ¿wers to it, <hi>as face anÅ¿wers face,</hi> Provi xxvii. 19.

<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031170_0130_0FEB1499C09575B8"/>
there were not Å¿omething of fraud or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juÅ¿tice, which like a canorous humour, mixt in its very elements and conÅ¿titution, and eat out its bowels: Or whether Å¿ome Å¿acrilegious prize, Å¿ome coal from the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar have not fired his neÅ¿t. Or if nothing can be charged upon the thing gained, let him conÅ¿ider how he has uÅ¿ed it; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he has not made it the fuel of his luÅ¿ts, in riot and exceÅ¿Å¿es, or the object of his adoration in an inordinate value of it. In like manner he who is afflicted in his body, groans under the torment of Å¿ome grievous diÅ¿eaÅ¿e, may very Å¿eaÅ¿onably interrogate himÅ¿elf, whether it has not been contracted by his vice, whether <hi>his bones be not</hi> (in a more literal Å¿enÅ¿e than <hi>Job</hi> meant it) <hi>full of the Å¿ins of his youth,</hi> Job xx. 11. and his Å¿urfeiting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneÅ¿s be not the cauÅ¿e, <hi>that his Å¿oul,</hi> as the PÅ¿almiÅ¿t Å¿peaks, <hi>abhors all manner of next, and is even hard at death's door,</hi> PÅ¿al. evii. 18. or at leaÅ¿t whether the not employing his health and Å¿trength to thoÅ¿e purpoÅ¿es for which it was given, is not the reaÅ¿on of its being withdrawn. He alÅ¿o that is invaded in his reputation, that lies under Å¿ome great infamy, is to conÅ¿ider whether it be not deÅ¿erved; whether Å¿ome part, if not the whole guilt of which he is accuÅ¿ed, Å¿tick not to him: Or if he be clear in that particular inÅ¿tance, whether
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031170_0131_0FEB149B709FA990"/>
Å¿ome concealed Å¿in of his would not if it were known, incur as great Å¿candal. For in that caÅ¿e he has in right forfeited his reputation, and God may make the Å¿eiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure as well by an unjuÅ¿t, as a juÅ¿t accuÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Or if his heart accuÅ¿e him not here, yet let him further reflect, whether; his vain-glorious purÅ¿uits of praiÅ¿e and high conceits of himÅ¿elf, have not made this an apt and neceÅ¿Å¿ary humiliation for him. Or laÅ¿tly, let him recollect how he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himÅ¿elf towards others in this kind: Whether he has had a juÅ¿t tenderneÅ¿s of his neighbour's fame, or has not rather expoÅ¿ed and proÅ¿tituted it. In theÅ¿e and many other inÅ¿tances Å¿uch a particular Å¿crutiny would (in all probability, diÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the affinity and cognation between our guilts and our puniÅ¿hments, and by mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Å¿pring and fountain-head, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us how to Å¿top or divert the current. And he that would diligently employ himÅ¿elf in this inquiÅ¿ition, would find lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leiÅ¿ure, and leÅ¿s cauÅ¿e to condole his afflictions, but would divert all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints upon himÅ¿elf, <hi>accept of the puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his iniquity, and thank the Lord for thus giving him warning,</hi> PÅ¿al. xvi 7.</p>
               <p n="5">A Å¿econd benefit which God deÅ¿igns us in our afflictions, is the weaning us from the world, to diÅ¿entangle us from its Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

and charms, and draw us to himÅ¿elf. We read in the Å¿tory of the deluge that Å¿o long as the earth was covered with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the very raven was contented to take Å¿helter in the ark, but when all was fair and dry, even the dove finally forÅ¿ook it, Gen. viii. 12. And it is much Å¿o with us: The worÅ¿t of men will commonly in diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es have recourÅ¿e to God (the very heathen mariners in a Å¿torm could rebuke <hi>Jonah</hi> for not calling upon his God, Jon. i. 6.) when yet the very beÅ¿t of us are apt to forget him amidÅ¿t the blandiÅ¿hments and inÅ¿inuations of proÅ¿perity. The kind aÅ¿pects of the world are very enchanting, apt to inveigle and beÅ¿ot us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is God's care over us, to let us Å¿ometimes Å¿ee her more averting counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in her frowns and Å¿torms; that, as children frighted by Å¿ome ugly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we may run into the arms of our Father. Alas! were all things exactly Å¿itted to our humours here, when Å¿hould we think of a remove? and had not death Å¿ome harbingers to prepare us for him, what a Å¿urpriÅ¿ing gueÅ¿t would he be to us? 'Tis Å¿toried of <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that Å¿eeing a Å¿oldier in his camp of Å¿o daring a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that he always courted the moÅ¿t ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous attempts, and obÅ¿erving him alÅ¿o of a very infirm Å¿ickly habit, he took a

particular care of him, and by medicines and good attendance recovered him; which no Å¿ooner had he done, but the man grew more cautious, and would no longer expoÅ¿e himÅ¿elf as formerly, and gave this reaÅ¿on for it, that now he was healthy, his life was of Å¿ome value to him, and not to be hazarded at that Å¿ame rate, as when it was only a burden; and Å¿hould God cure all our complaints, render us perfectly at eaÅ¿e, I fear too many of us would be of the Å¿oldier's mind, think our lives to good to reÅ¿ign to him, much more to hazard for him, as our ChriÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity in many caÅ¿es obliges us. The Å¿on of <hi>Syrach</hi> obÅ¿erves, how <hi>dreadful death is to a man that is at reÅ¿t in his poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions, that hath abundance of all things, and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to vex him;</hi> nay he deÅ¿cends much lower, and puts in him <hi>who is yet able to receive meat,</hi> Ecclus. xiv. 1. The truth is, we do Å¿o paÅ¿Å¿ionately doat upon the world, that like beÅ¿otted lovers we can bear a great deal of ill uÅ¿age, before we quit our purÅ¿uit. Any little Å¿light favour atones us after multiplied affronts, and we muÅ¿t be diÅ¿ciplined by repeated diÅ¿ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, e'er we can withdraw our confidence. But how fatally Å¿ecure Å¿hould we be, if God Å¿hould permit this Å¿iren al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to entertain us with her muÅ¿ic, and Å¿hould not by Å¿ome diÅ¿cordant grating

notes, interrupt our raptures, and recall us to Å¿ober thoughts?</p>
               <p n="6">Indeed it is one of the higheÅ¿t in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tances of God's love, and of his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy alÅ¿o, thus to project our reducement. We were all in our baptiÅ¿m affianced to him, with a particular abrenunciation of the world, Å¿o that we cannot without the greateÅ¿t diÅ¿loyalty caÅ¿t ourÅ¿elves into its embraces; and yet when we have thus <hi>broken the covenant of our God,</hi> God, Prov. ii. 17. he does not purÅ¿ue us with a jealous rage, with the Å¿everity which an abuÅ¿ed rivalled kindneÅ¿s would Å¿uggeÅ¿t; doth not give us a bill of divorce and diÅ¿claim his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but contrives how he may reclaim and bring us back to himÅ¿elf. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cendency of this lenity God excellently deÅ¿cribes by the prophet in the caÅ¿e of <hi>IÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, They Å¿ay, if a man put away his wife, and Å¿he become another man's, Å¿hall he return unto her again? but thou haÅ¿t played the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot with many lovers, yet return unto me Å¿aith the Lord?</hi> Jer. iii. 1. And this, though a great height of indulgence, is no more than he daily repeats to us. After we have baÅ¿ely adulterated with the world, converted our affections from God to it, he does not give us over, abandon us to our lewd courÅ¿e, and conÅ¿equent ruin; but Å¿till invites our return: and leÅ¿t that
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031170_0135_0FEB150EC66B2870"/>
may not Å¿erve, he does with a great deal of holy artifice eÅ¿Å¿ay to break that accurÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed league into which we are entered, pulls off the diÅ¿guiÅ¿e in which the world court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and makes us Å¿ee it as it is in itÅ¿elf, a Å¿cene of <hi>vanity and vexation of Å¿pirit,</hi> Eccles. i. 14.</p>
               <p n="7">And as he does this in general, Å¿o alÅ¿o with a particular application to thoÅ¿e temporal Å¿atisfactions wherewith we were moÅ¿t tranÅ¿ported. The things to which we are more indifferent do not Å¿o much endanger us; it is thoÅ¿e upon which we have more vehemently Å¿et our hearts, which become our Å¿nares, and awake his jealouÅ¿y; and accordingly we frequently Å¿ee that it is in thoÅ¿e he chuÅ¿es to croÅ¿s us. How often does it happen that thoÅ¿e which are enamoured of themÅ¿elves, dote upon their own features, do meet with Å¿ome diÅ¿eaÅ¿e or accident which blaÅ¿ts their beauty, withers that fair flower, and makes their winter overtake their Å¿pring? So in our friends and relations it is uÅ¿ually Å¿een, we Å¿ooneÅ¿t looÅ¿e thoÅ¿e for whom we have the greateÅ¿t, the moÅ¿t immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate paÅ¿Å¿ion. If there be one fondling among our children, it is odds but that is taken away, or made as much the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our grief and Å¿orrow, as ever it was of our joy and love. When God
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031170_0136_0FEB14A714A1C8B8"/>
Å¿ees our hearts Å¿o exceÅ¿Å¿ively cleave to any tranÅ¿itory thing, he knows it is neceÅ¿Å¿ary to Å¿ever them, for whilÅ¿t we have Å¿uch clogs upon us, <hi>our Å¿ouls will cleave to the duÅ¿t,</hi> will not be able to Å¿oar up to the higheÅ¿t Region for which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned.</p>
               <p n="8">In a word, God Å¿o loves us, that he removes whatever he Å¿ees will obÅ¿truct that intimate union which he deÅ¿ires with us; and Å¿ure this is Å¿o obliging, that though he Å¿hould bid us to our loÅ¿s, tho' he could not recompence us for what he takes from us, yet we muÅ¿t be very ill-natured if we can be angry at Å¿o much kindneÅ¿s. But when to this is added, that all this is principally, nay, Å¿olely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igned for our advantage, that God takes from us all theÅ¿e empty deluÅ¿ory content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, merely that he may inÅ¿tate us in Å¿olid and durable joys; we betray as much ignorance of our intereÅ¿t, as inÅ¿enÅ¿ible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s of our obligation, if we repine that God makes us Å¿o much his care. It is true indeed, the things to which we have Å¿o inordinately adhered, do Å¿tick Å¿o cloÅ¿e, that they cannot be pulled away without Å¿ome pain: yet for our corporal Å¿ecurity we can endure the Å¿undering of parts that do not only cleave, but grow <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

that has a gangrened member, Å¿uffers it to be cut off to Å¿ave his whole body, and does not revile, but thank and reward the Å¿urgeon. Yet where our Å¿ouls are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and where the things have no native union with us, but are only ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by our paÅ¿Å¿ions, we are impatient of the method, and think God deals very hardly with us, not to to let us periÅ¿h with what we love. The Å¿um of all is this, God, though he be abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deÅ¿cending, yet he will never Å¿toop Å¿o low as to Å¿hare his intereÅ¿t in us with the world: If we will devote ourÅ¿elves to it, it is not all our empty forms of Å¿ervice will Å¿atisfy him; if we cannot divorce our hearts from it, he will divorce himÅ¿elf eternally from us. And the caÅ¿e being thus, we are Å¿urely very ill adviÅ¿ed if we do not contentedly reÅ¿ign ourÅ¿elves to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and cheerfully endure them how Å¿harp Å¿oever. The only expedient we have for our own caÅ¿e, is to Å¿horten the cure by giving our aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, and not by Å¿truggling to render it more difficult and painful. Let us entirely Å¿urrender our wills to him, and when we have done that, we may without much pain let him take any thing elÅ¿e. But the more difficult we find it to be diÅ¿entangled from the world, the greater Å¿hould our caution be againÅ¿t all future engagements to it. If our eÅ¿cape

Now we know in a war men muÅ¿t not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to paÅ¿s their time in eaÅ¿e and Å¿oftneÅ¿s, but beÅ¿ides all the dangers and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the combat, have many other hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hips to endure; hunger and thirÅ¿t, heat and cold, hard lodgings and weary marches: and he that is too nice for thoÅ¿e, will not long Å¿tick to his colours. And it is the Å¿ame in our Å¿piritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; many preÅ¿Å¿ures and Å¿ufferings are annexed to it, and our paÅ¿Å¿ive valour is no leÅ¿s tried than our active. In reÅ¿pect of this it is that our Saviour admoniÅ¿hes his proÅ¿elytes to compute firÅ¿t the difficulties incident to their profeÅ¿Å¿ion, and that he may not enÅ¿nare us by propoÅ¿ing too eaÅ¿y terms, he bids us reckon upon the worÅ¿t, and tells us, that he <hi>that forÅ¿akes not all that he hath, Å¿hall not be his diÅ¿ciple</hi> Luke xiv. 26. <hi>and that we muÅ¿t through much tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> Acts xiv. 22.

               <p n="10">This hath been Å¿o much conÅ¿idered by pious men, that they have looked upon their Å¿ecular proÅ¿perities with fear and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louÅ¿y, and many have Å¿olemnly petitioned for croÅ¿Å¿es, as thinking them the neceÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry atteÅ¿tation of their Å¿onÅ¿hip, and means of aÅ¿Å¿imulation to their elder brother.

diÅ¿charged of thoÅ¿e temporal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances himÅ¿elf has annexed to it? This were Å¿ure as unjuÅ¿t a hope, as it would be a vain one. When <hi>David</hi> had that enÅ¿nared propoÅ¿al made him, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the king's Å¿on-in-law, 1 Sam. xviii. 11. he Å¿et Å¿uch a value upon the dignity, that he deÅ¿piÅ¿ed the difficulty of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: And Å¿ure we muÅ¿t have very low abject Å¿ouls, if when Å¿o infinitely a higher advancement is Å¿incerely offered us, we can Å¿uffer any apprehenÅ¿ion of hardÅ¿hip to divert us. In a word, let us remember that of the apoÅ¿tle, <hi>if we Å¿uffer, we Å¿hall alÅ¿o reign with him,</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 12. And though our afflictions be in themÅ¿elves not joyous but grievous, yet when they are conÅ¿idered as the earneÅ¿t of our future inheritance, they put on another face, and may rather enamour that frighten us.</p>
               <p n="11">A fourth advantage of afflictions is, that they excite our compaÅ¿Å¿ions towards others: There is nothing qualifies us Å¿o rightly to eÅ¿timate the Å¿uffering of others, as the having ourÅ¿elves felt them; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this our apprehenÅ¿ions of them are as dull and confuÅ¿ed, as a blind man is of colours, or a deaf man of Å¿ounds.

Nay Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary is our experience towards our commiÅ¿eration, that we Å¿ee it was thought a requiÅ¿ite accompliÅ¿hment of our high-prieÅ¿t (that higheÅ¿t example of unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed compaÅ¿Å¿ion) and therefore Å¿aith the apoÅ¿tle, <hi>It behoved him in all things to be made like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high-prieÅ¿t in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to God, to make reconciliation for the Å¿ins of the people, for in that he himÅ¿elf hath Å¿uffered being tempted, he is able alÅ¿o to Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. ii. 17, 18. But if he whoÅ¿e mere Å¿enÅ¿e of our miÅ¿eries brought him down to us, choÅ¿e this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to advance his pity, how neceÅ¿Å¿ary is it to our petrified bowels? And Å¿ince God has aÅ¿Å¿igned our mercies to our brethren as the Å¿tandard by which he will proportion his to us, it is more ours than their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to have them enlarged; Å¿o that when by making us taÅ¿te of their cup, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with the bitter reliÅ¿h of their Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; he prepares us to a chriÅ¿tian Å¿ym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy with them, it is but a remoter way of obliging and qualifying us for a more ample portion of his mercy.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have all reaÅ¿on to bleÅ¿s him for that diÅ¿cipline by which he promotes us in to excellent, Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary a grace.</p>
               <p n="12">A fifth benefit of affliction, is, that it is an improvement of devotion, Å¿ets us with more heartineÅ¿s to our prayers. WhilÅ¿t proÅ¿perity flows in upon us, we bathe ourÅ¿elves in its Å¿treams, but are very apt to forget its Å¿ource; Å¿o that God is fain to Å¿top the current, leave us dry and parched, that our needs may make us do what our gratitude would not, trace our bleÅ¿Å¿ings up to the original Å¿pring, and both acknowledge and invoke him as the author of all our good. This effect of afflictions is obÅ¿erved by the Prophet, <hi>Lord, in trouble have they viÅ¿ited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chaÅ¿tening was upon them,</hi> IÅ¿a. xxvi. 16. And I believe I may appeal to every man's experience, whether his prayers be not more frequent and more hearty too, when he is under Å¿ome diÅ¿treÅ¿s. They how importunate are we in our petitions? how profuÅ¿e in our vows and promiÅ¿es? Å¿aying with <hi>IÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Deliver us only we pray thee this day:
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031170_0144_0FEB14BE0A729B38"/>
and they put away the Å¿trange gods from among them, and Å¿erved the Lord,</hi> Jud. x. 15, 16. I confeÅ¿s, it is no good indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our temper, that we need thus to be put in the preÅ¿s e're we will yield any thing; yet Å¿ince we are Å¿o diÅ¿ingenuous, it is a mercy in God to adapt his methods to us, to extort when we will not give; and if he can have no free-will-offerings, yet at leaÅ¿t to exact his tribute. Nor does he deÅ¿ign the effect of this Å¿hould ceaÅ¿e with the calamity that raiÅ¿ed it, but expects our compelled addreÅ¿Å¿es Å¿hould bring us into the way of voluntary ones, and happily enÅ¿nare us into piety. And indeed herein we are worÅ¿e than brutiÅ¿h if it do not. We think it a barbarous rudeneÅ¿s to engage a man in our affairs, and as Å¿oon as we have Å¿erved our own turns, never take farther notice of him. Nay indeed the very beaÅ¿ts may lecture us in this piece of morality, many of them paying a Å¿ignal gratitude, where they have received benefits; and Å¿hall we not come up at leaÅ¿t to their pitch! Å¿hall not the endearment of our deliverance bring our Deliverer into Å¿ome repute and conÅ¿ideration with us, and make us deÅ¿ire to keep up an acquaintance and intercourÅ¿e with him? Yet if ingenuity work not with us, let intereÅ¿t at leaÅ¿t prevail, and the

A very inÅ¿olent folly to renounce that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance by which alone they Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿ted, and no leÅ¿s will it be in any of us if we Å¿top our recourÅ¿e to him becauÅ¿e we have had advantage by it.

                  </gap> that intercourÅ¿e which in the interval we deÅ¿piÅ¿ed? So that if we have but any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary providence we Å¿hall Å¿till Å¿o cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate paÅ¿t reÅ¿cues, as to continue in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of begging more, and then we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but alÅ¿o confeÅ¿s the benefit of thoÅ¿e firÅ¿t calamities which inÅ¿pirited our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and taught us to pray in earneÅ¿t, and will be aÅ¿hamed that our thanks Å¿hould be uttered in a fainter accent than our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or our daily Å¿piritual concerns Å¿hould be more coldly Å¿olicited than our temporal accidental ones.</p>
               <p n="13">Nor is it only our devotion that is thus improved by our diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other graces; our faith, our hope, our patience, our ChriÅ¿tian Å¿ufferance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. It is no triumph of faith to truÅ¿t God for thoÅ¿e good things which he gives
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031170_0146_0FEB14C4F79F45E8"/>

So alÅ¿o our patience owes all its opportunities of exerciÅ¿e to our afflictions, and conÅ¿equently owes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o a great part of its being to them, for we know deÅ¿uetude will loÅ¿e habits. What imaginable uÅ¿e is there of patience, where there is nothing to Å¿uffer? In our proÅ¿per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Å¿tate we may indeed employ our tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, our humility, our caution; but patience Å¿eems then an uÅ¿eleÅ¿s virtue: Nay indeed, for ought we know, may be counterfeit, till adverÅ¿ity bring it to the teÅ¿t. And yet this is the moÅ¿t glorious accompliÅ¿hment of a ChriÅ¿tian, that which moÅ¿t eminently conforms him to the image of his Saviour, whoÅ¿e whole life was a perpetual exerciÅ¿e of this grace; and therefore we love our eaÅ¿e too well if we are unwilling to buy this pearl at any price.</p>
               <p n="14">LaÅ¿tly, Our thankfulneÅ¿s is (at leaÅ¿t ought to be) increaÅ¿ed by our diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treÅ¿Å¿es. It is very natural for us to reflect with value and eÅ¿teem upon thoÅ¿e bleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ings we have loÅ¿t, and we too often do
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:031170_0147_0FEB14C69D434D70"/>
it to aggravate our diÅ¿content: But Å¿ure, the moÅ¿t rational uÅ¿e of it is to raiÅ¿e our thankfulneÅ¿s for the time wherein we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed them. Nay not only our former enjoyments, but even our preÅ¿ent depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations deÅ¿erve our gratitude, if we conÅ¿ider the happy advantages we may reap from them. If we will perverÅ¿ely caÅ¿t them away, that unworthy contempt pays no Å¿cores, for we Å¿till Å¿tand anÅ¿werable in God's account for the good he deÅ¿igned, and we might have had by it, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come liable to a new charge for our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in thus <hi>deÅ¿piÅ¿ing the chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ement of the Lord,</hi> Heb. xii. 5.</p>
               <p n="15">And now if all theÅ¿e benefits of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions (which are yet but imperfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited) may be thought worth conÅ¿idering, it cannot but reconcile us to the Å¿harpeÅ¿t of God's methods; unleÅ¿s we will own ourÅ¿elves Å¿uch mere animals, as to have no other apprehenÅ¿ions than what our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Å¿enÅ¿es convey to us. For Å¿ure, he that has reaÅ¿on enough to underÅ¿tand that he has an immortal Å¿oul, cannot but aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent that its intereÅ¿ts Å¿hould be Å¿erved, though with diÅ¿placency of his fleÅ¿h. Yet even in regard of that, our murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are oft very unjuÅ¿t, for we do many times ignorantly prejudge God's deÅ¿igns towards us even in temporals, who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

makes a little tranÅ¿ient uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s, the paÅ¿Å¿age to Å¿ecular felicities. <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi> when he fled our of <hi>Egypt,</hi> probably little thought that he Å¿hould return thither a <hi>God unto Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. iv. 16. and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did <hi>JoÅ¿eph</hi> when he was brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Å¿lave, that he was to be a ruler there; yet as diÅ¿tant as thoÅ¿e Å¿tates were, the divine Providence has Å¿o connected them, that the one depends upon the other. And certainly we may often obÅ¿erve the like over-ruling hand in our own diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that thoÅ¿e events which we have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the greateÅ¿t regret, have in the conÅ¿equences been very beneficial to us.</p>
               <p n="16">To conclude, we have certainly both from Å¿peculation and experience, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant matter to calm all our diÅ¿quiets, to Å¿atisfy our diÅ¿truÅ¿ts, and to fix in us an entire reÅ¿ignation to God's diÅ¿poÅ¿als, who has deÅ¿igns which we cannot penetrate, but none which we need fear, unleÅ¿s we ourÅ¿elves pervert them. We have our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's word for it, that <hi>he will not give us a Å¿tone when we aÅ¿k bread, nor a Å¿corpion when we aÅ¿k a fiÅ¿h,</hi> Matth. vii. 9.

The firÅ¿t and moÅ¿t fundamental is, the mortifying our pride, which as it is the Å¿eminary of moÅ¿t Å¿ins, Å¿o eÅ¿pecially this of repining. Men that are highly opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioned of themÅ¿elves are commonly unÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfiable: For how well Å¿oever they are treated, they Å¿till think it Å¿hort of their merits. Princes have often experimented this in thoÅ¿e who have done them Å¿ignal Å¿ervices; but God finds it in thoÅ¿e who have done him none, and we expect he Å¿hall diÅ¿penÅ¿e to us according to thoÅ¿e falÅ¿e eÅ¿timates we put upon ourÅ¿elves. Therefore he that aÅ¿pires to content, muÅ¿t firÅ¿t take truer meaÅ¿ures of himÅ¿elf, and conÅ¿ider that as he was nothing till God gave him a being, Å¿o all that he can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce from that being, is God's by origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal right, and therefore can pretend to nothing of reward; Å¿o that whatever he receives, is Å¿till upon the account of a new bounty; and to complain that he has no more, is like the murmurs of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful debtor, who would Å¿till increaÅ¿e thoÅ¿e Å¿cores which he knows he can never pay.</p>
               <p n="3">In the Å¿econd place, let every man conÅ¿ider how many bleÅ¿Å¿ings (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding his having no claim to any) he daily enjoys; and whether thoÅ¿e he Å¿o im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently raves after, be not much inferior
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031170_0172_0FEB150BEBF9FAF8"/>
to them. Nay let him aÅ¿k his own heart whether he would quit all thoÅ¿e he has, for them he wants; and if he would not (as I Å¿uppoÅ¿e no man in his wits would, thoÅ¿e wits being part of the parter) let him then judge how unreaÅ¿onable his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinings are, when himÅ¿elf confeÅ¿Å¿es he has the better part of worldly happineÅ¿s, and never any man living had all.</p>
               <p n="4">In the third place therefore let him Å¿ecure his duty of thankfulneÅ¿s for thoÅ¿e good things he hath, and that will inÅ¿enÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly undermine his impatiencies for the reÅ¿t, it being impoÅ¿Å¿ible to be at once thankful and murmuring. To this purpose it were very well, if he would keep a Å¿olemn catalogue of all the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, protections, and deliverances he has received from God's hand, and every night examine what acceÅ¿Å¿ions that day has brought to the Å¿um: And he that did this, would undoubtedly find Å¿o many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations to gratitude, that all thoÅ¿e to diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content would be Å¿tifled in the croud. And Å¿ince acknowledgement of God's mercies is all the tribute he exacts for them, we muÅ¿t certainly look on that as an indiÅ¿penÅ¿able duty: And therefore he that finds that God Å¿hortens his hand, Å¿tops the efflux of his bounty towards
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031170_0173_0FEAE55BC76E5030"/>
him, Å¿hould reflect on himÅ¿elf whether he be not behind in that homage by which he holds, and have not by his unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s <hi>turned away good things from him,</hi> IÅ¿ai. lix. 1. And if he find it Å¿o (as who alas is there that may not!) he cannot Å¿ure for Å¿hame complain, but muÅ¿t in prudence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce his gratitude for what is left, as the beÅ¿t means to recover what he has loÅ¿t.</p>
               <p n="5">But his murmurs will yet be more amazingly Å¿ilenced, if in the fourth place he compares the good things he enjoys with the ill he has done. Certainly this is a moÅ¿t infallible cure for our impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the holieÅ¿t man living being able to accuÅ¿e himÅ¿elf of Å¿uch Å¿ins, as would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all human meaÅ¿ures of equity forfeit all bleÅ¿Å¿ings, and pull down a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er weight of judgment than the moÅ¿t mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erable groan under. Therefore as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I adviÅ¿ed to keep a catalogue of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received, so here it would be of uÅ¿e to draw up one of Å¿ins committed. And doubtleÅ¿s he that confronts the one with the other, cannot but be aÅ¿toniÅ¿hed to find them both Å¿o numerous, equally wondering at God's mercy in continuing his bleÅ¿Å¿ings, in deÅ¿pite of all his provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and at his own baÅ¿eneÅ¿s in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his provocations in deÅ¿pite of all thoÅ¿e
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031170_0174_0FEB1511BAB25630"/>
bleÅ¿Å¿ings. Indeed it is nothing but our affected ignorance of our demerits, that makes it poÅ¿Å¿ible for us to repine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Å¿evereÅ¿t of God's diÅ¿penÅ¿ations. Would we but ranÅ¿ack our hearts, and Å¿ee all the abominations that lie there, nay would the moÅ¿t of us but recollect thoÅ¿e barefaced crimes which even the world can witneÅ¿s againÅ¿t us, we Å¿hould find more than enough to balance the heavieÅ¿t of our preÅ¿Å¿ures. When therefore by our impatient Å¿trugglings we fret and gall our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves under our burdens, let us interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate our Å¿ouls in the words of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Why doth a living man complain, a man for the puniÅ¿hment of his Å¿in?</hi> Let us not Å¿pend our breath in murmurs and outcries, which will only Å¿erve to provoke more Å¿tripes: But <hi>let us Å¿earch and try our ways, and</hi> turn <hi>again to the Lord,</hi> Lam. iii. 39, 43. diligently Å¿eek out <hi>that accurÅ¿ed thing</hi> which has cauÅ¿ed our diÅ¿comfiture, and by the removal of that, prepare the way for the acceÅ¿s of mercy.

We accuÅ¿e every thing but what we ought, furiouÅ¿ly fly at all the Å¿econd cauÅ¿es of our calamity, nay too often at the firÅ¿t, by impious diÅ¿putes of providence, and in the mean time, as <hi>Job</hi> Å¿peaks, <hi>the root of the matter is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

is all that we uÅ¿ually get by our foreÅ¿ights. ProviÅ¿ion is one of God's attributes, and he mocks all our pretences to it, by a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent defeating of all our fore-caÅ¿ts. He does it often in our hopes: Å¿ome little croÅ¿s circumÅ¿tance many times demoliÅ¿hes thoÅ¿e goodly machines we raiÅ¿e to ourÅ¿elves and he does it no leÅ¿s in our fears: ThoÅ¿e ills we Å¿olemnly expected often baulk us, and others from an unexpected coaÅ¿t Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly invade us.

It will therefore be good for every man when he goes to addreÅ¿s for relief, to conÅ¿ider what of his preÅ¿Å¿ures they are that are worthy of that Å¿olemn deprecation: and when he has Å¿ingled thoÅ¿e out, let him reflect, and he will find he has in that prejudged all his other diÅ¿contents as frivolous or wicked. And then Å¿ure he cannot think fit to harbour them, but muÅ¿t for Å¿hame diÅ¿miÅ¿s them, Å¿ince they are Å¿uch as he dare not avow to him from whom alone he can expect relief.

I Å¿ay this becauÅ¿e it is a little too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that many take up books only as they do cards or dice, as an inÅ¿trument of diverÅ¿ion.
