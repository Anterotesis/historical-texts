            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>BELOVED FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>FEELING at this time a renewed concern that the pure principle of Light and Life, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous fruits thereof may ſpread and prevail amongſt mankind, there is an engagement on my heart to labour with my brethren in religious profeſſion, that none of us may be a ſtumbling block in the way of others; but may ſo walk that our conduct may reach the pure Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the hearts of ſuch who are not in profeſſion with us.</p>
            <p>And, dear Friends, while we publicly own that the Holy Spirit is our leader, the profeſſion is in itſelf weight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the weightineſs thereof increaſeth, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we are noted among the profeſſors of Truth, and active in dealing with ſuch who walk diſorderly.</p>
            <p>Many under our profeſſion for want of due attention, and a perfect reſignation, to this Divine Teacher, have in ſome things manifeſted a deviation from the purity of our religious principles, and theſe deviations having crept in amongſt us by little and little, and increaſing from leſs to greater, have been ſo far unnoticed, that ſome living in them, have been active in putting diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in practice with relation to others, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct hath appeared more diſhonourable in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:012630_0002_0F8B9278CC63E3E8"/>
Now as my mind hath been exerciſed before the Lord, I have ſeen, that the diſcipline of the Church of Chriſt ſtandeth in that which is pure; that it is the wiſdom from above which gives authority to diſcipline, and that the weightineſs thereof ſtandeth not in any outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but in the authority of Chriſt who is the author of it; and where any walk after the fleſh, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purity of Truth, and at the ſame time are active in putting diſcipline in practice, a veil is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually drawn over the purity of diſcipline, and over that holineſs of life, which Chriſt leads thoſe into, <q>in whom the love of God is verily perfected,</q> 1 <hi>John</hi> ii. 5.</p>
            <p>When we labour in true love with offenders, and they remain obſtinate, it ſometimes is neceſſary to proceed as far as our Lord directed, <q>
                  <hi>Let him be to thee as an heathen man, or a publican,</hi>
               </q> Mat. xviii. 17.</p>
            <p>Now when ſuch are diſowned, and they who act there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in feel Chriſt made unto them wiſdom, and are preſerved in his meek, reſtoring ſpirit, there is no juſt cauſe of offence miniſtred to any; but when ſuch who are active in dealing with offenders indulge themſelves in things which are contrary to the purity of Truth, and yet judge others whoſe conduct appears more diſhonourable than their's, here the pure authority of diſcipline ceaſeth as to ſuch offenders, and a temptation is laid in their way to wrangle and contend;—<hi>"Judge not,"</hi> ſaid our Lord, <hi>"that ye be not judged."</hi> Now this forbidding, alludes to man's judgment, and points out the neceſſity of our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attending to that ſanctifying Power under which the Faithful experience the Lord to be "a ſpirit of judgment to them," <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxviii. 6. And as we feel his Holy Spirit to mortify the deeds of the body in us, and can ſay, <q>it is no more I that live, but Chriſt that liveth in me,</q> here right judgment is known.</p>
            <p>And while Divine Love prevails in our hearts, and Self in us is brought under judgment, a preparation is
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:012630_0003_0F8B9279989A33D8"/>felt to labour in a right manner with offenders; but it we abide not in this love, our outward performance in dealing with others, degenerates into formality; for <hi>"this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,"</hi> John i.3.</p>
            <p>How weighty are thoſe inſtructions of our Redeemer concerning religious duties, when he points out, that they who may, ſhould be ſo obedient to the teachings of the Holy Spirit, that humbly conſiding in his help, they may ſay, "Thy name O Father be hallowed! Thy kingdom come! thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven!"—In this awful ſtate of mind is felt that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which ſtands in doing the will of God, on earth, as it is done in heaven, and keeping the Holy Name ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred? To take a holy profeſſion upon us is awful, nor can we keep this Holy Name ſacred, but by humbly abiding under the croſs of Chriſt. The apoſtle laid a heavy complaint againſt ſome who prophaned this Holy Name by their manner of living, "through you," he ſays, "the name of God is blaſphemed among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,"<hi>Rom.</hi>
ii. 24.</p>
            <p>Some of our anceſtors through many tribulations were gathered into the ſtate of true worſhippers, and had fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in that which is pure, and as one was inwardly moved to kneel down in their aſſemblies, and publickly call on the name of the Lord, thoſe in the harmony of united exerciſe then preſent, joined in the prayer; I mention this in order that we of the preſent age, may look unto the Rock from whence we were hewn, and remember that to unite in worſhip, is a union in prayer, and that prayer acceptable to the Father is only in a mind truly ſanctified, where the ſacred name is kept holy, and the heart reſigned to do his will on earth as it is done in heaven, <hi>"If ye abide in me,"</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <q>
                  <hi>and my words abide in you, ye ſhall aſk what ye will in my name, and it ſhall be done unto you.</hi>
               </q>—Now we know not what
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012630_0004_0F8B927A4A702650"/>to pray for as we ought, but as the Holy Spirit doth open and direct our minds, and as we faithfully yield to its influences, our prayers are in the will of our Heavenly Father, who fails not to grant that which his own Spirit, through his Children, aſketh;—thus preſervation from ſin is known, and the fruits of righteouſneſs are brought forth by ſuch who inwardly unite in prayer.</p>
            <p>How weighty are our ſolemn meetings when the name of Chriſt is kept holy?</p>
            <p>"How precious is that ſtate in which the children of the Lord are ſo redemed from the love "of this world, that they are accepted and bleſſed in all that they do." R. Barclay's Apology, p. 404.</p>
            <p>How neceſſary is it that we who profeſs theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and are outwardly active in ſupporting them, ſhould faithfully abide in Divine Strength, that <q>
                  <hi>As He who has called us, is holy, ſo we may be holy in all manner of converſation,</hi>
               </q> 1 Pet. i. 15.</p>
            <p>If one proſeſſing to be influenced by the Spirit of Chriſt, propoſe to unite in a labour to promote rightcouſneſs in the earth, and in time paſt he hath manifeſtly deviated from the path of equity, then to act conſiſtent with this principle, his firſt work is to make reſtitution ſo far as he may be enabled; for if he attempts to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a work intended to promote righteouſneſs, while it appears that he neglecteth, or refuſeth to act righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly himſelf, his conduct has a tendency to entangle the minds of thoſe who are weak in the faith, who behold theſe things, and to draw a veil over the purity of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by carrying an appearance as though that was righteouſneſs which is not.</p>
            <p>Again, if I propoſe to aſſiſt in ſupporting thoſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines wherein that purity of life is held forth, in which cuſtoms proceeding from the ſpirit of this world have no place, and at the ſame time ſtrengthen others in thoſe cuſtoms by my example; the firſt ſtep then in an orderly
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012630_0005_0F8B927B05ED5580"/>proceeding, is to ceaſe from thoſe cuſtoms myſelf, and afterwards to labour, as I may be enabled, to promote the like diſpoſition and conduct in others.</p>
            <p>To be convinced of the pure principle of Truth, and diligently exerciſed in walking anſwerable thereto, is neceſſary before I can conſiſtently recommend this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to others.—I often feel a labour in ſpirit, that we who are active members in religious ſociety may experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ourſelves the truth of thoſe expreſſions of the Holy One— "I will be ſanctiſied in them that come nigh me." <hi>Lev.</hi> x. 3.—in this caſe, my mind hath been often exerciſed when alone, year after year, for many years, and in the renewings of Divine Love, a tender care hath been incited in me, that we who profeſs the inward principle of light to be our teacher, may be a family unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that purity of worſhip, which comprehends a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and miniſters inſtruction to others.</p>
            <p>My mind is often drawn towards children in the Truth, who having a ſmall ſhare of the things of this life, and coming to have families may be inwardly exerciſed before the Lord to ſupport them in a way agreeable to the purity of Truth, in which they may feel his bleſſing upon them in their labours; the thoughts of ſuch being entangled with cuſtoms (contrary to pure wiſdom) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to them through our hands, doth often very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and movingly affect my heart, and when I look towards, and think on the ſucceeding generation, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent deſires are raiſed in me, that we by yielding to that Holy Spirit which leads into all truth, may not do the work of the Lord deceitfully, may not live contrary to the purity of the Divine Principle we profeſs; but that as faithful labourers in our age, we may be inſtrumental in removing ſtumbling blocks out of the way of thoſe who may ſucceed us.</p>
            <p>So great was the love of Chriſt, that he gave himſelf for the church, <q>that he might ſanctify and cleanſe it,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012630_0006_0F8B927BC9441DB8"/>that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing,</q> 
               <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 25. and where any take the name of Chriſt upon them, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to be members of his church, and led by his Holy Spirit, and yet manifeſtly deviate from the purity of Truth, they herein act againſt the gracious deſign of his giving himſelf for them, and miniſter cauſe for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his afflictions, viz. in his body the church.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſuffered afflictions in a body of fleſh prepared by the Father, but the afflictions of his myſtical body are yet unfiniſhed; for they who are baptized into Chriſt are baptized into his death, and as we humbly abide un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſanctifying Power, and are brought forth into newneſs of life, we feel Chriſt to live in us, who being the ſame yeſterday, to-day, and forever, and always at unity with himſelf, his Spirit in the hearts of his people leads to an inward exerciſe for the ſalvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and when under a travail of ſpirit, we behold a viſited people entangled by the ſpirit of this world with its wickedneſs and cuſtoms, and thereby rendered inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being faithful examples to others, ſorrow and heavineſs under a ſenſe of theſe things, is often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced, and thus in ſome meaſure is filled up that which remains of the afflictions of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour ſpeaking concerning gifts offered in Divine Service, ſays, <q>
                  <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi>
               </q> Mat. v. 23, 24.—Now there is no true unity, but in that wherein the Father, and the Son are united, nor can there be a perfect reconciliation but in ceaſing from that which miniſters cauſe for the continuation of the afflictions of Chriſt; and if any profeſſing to bring their gift to the altar, do remember the cuſtomary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction which ſome of their fruits bear to the pure,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012630_0007_0F8B927C7B170788"/>ſpiritual worſhip, here it appears neceſſary to lay to heart this command, <hi>"leave thy gift by the altar."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt graciouſly calls his people brethren, <q>
                  <hi>whoſoever ſhall do the will of God the ſame is my brother.</hi>
               </q> Mark iii. 35. Now if we walk contrary to the Truth as it is in Jeſus, while we continue to profeſs it, we offend againſt Chriſt, and if under this offence we bring our gift to the altar, our Redeemer doth not direct us to take back our gift, he doth not diſcourage our proceeding in a good work; but graciouſly points out the neceſſary means by which the gift may be rendered acceptable, "<hi>leave,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thy giſt by the altar, firſt go and be reconciled to thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>" ceaſe from that which grieves the Holy Spirit, ceaſe from that which is againſt the Truth, as it is in Jeſus, and then come, and offer thy gift.</p>
            <p>I feel, while I am writing, a tenderneſs to thoſe who through Divine Favour are preſerved in a lively ſenſe of the ſtate of the churches, and at times may be under diſcouragements with regard to proceeding in that pure way which Chriſt by his Holy Spirit leads into: the depth of diſorder and weakneſs, which ſo much prevails, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, doubtings are apt to ariſe as to the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of proceeding as an aſſembly of the Lord's people in the pure council of Truth; and here I feel a concern to expreſs in uprightneſs, that which hath been opened in my mind, under the power of the Croſs of Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to a viſible gathered church, the members where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are guided by the Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>The church is called the body of Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> i. 24.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is called the head of the church, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 22.</p>
            <p>The church is called the Pillar, and ground of Truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 15.</p>
            <p>Thus the church hath a name that is ſacred, and the neceſſity of keeping this name holy, appears evident; for where a number of people unite in a profeſſion of being led by the Spirit of Chriſt, and publiſh their principles
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012630_0008_0F8B927D4A9486D0"/>to the world, the acts and proceedings of that people may in ſome meaſure be conſidered as ſuch which Chriſt is the author of.</p>
            <p>Now while we ſtand in this ſtation, if the pure light of life is not followed and regarded in our proceedings, we are in the way of prophaning the Holy Name, and of going back toward that wilderneſs of ſufferings and perſecution, out of which, through the tender mercies of God, a church hath been gathered; <q>
                  <hi>Chriſt liveth in ſanctified veſſels,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> ii. 20. and where they behold his Holy Name profanced, and the pure Goſpel Light eclipſed through the unfaithfulneſs of any who by their ſtation appear to be ſtandard bearers under the Prince of Peace, the living members in the body of Chriſt in beholding theſe things, do in ſome degree experience the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, and as the wiſdom of the world more and more takes place in conducting the affairs of this viſible gathered church, and the pure leadings of the Holy Spirit leſs waited for and followed, ſo the true ſuffering ſeed is more and more oppreſſed.</p>
            <p>My mind is often affected with a ſenſe of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſincere hearted people in ſome kingdoms, where liberty of conſcience is not allowed, many of whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burthened in their minds with prevailing ſuperſtition joined with oppreſſions, are often under ſorrow, and where ſuch have attended to that pure Light which hath in ſome degree opened their underſtandings, and for their faithfulneſs thereto, have been brought to exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and tryal, how heavy are the perſecutions which in divers parts of the world are exerciſed upon them? How mighty, as to the outward, is that power by which they are borne down, and oppreſſed?</p>
            <p>How deeply affecting is the condition of many upright hearted people who are taken into the papal inquiſition? What lamentable cruelties, in deep vaults, in a private way, are exerciſed on many of them? and how linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012630_0009_0F8B927F7B8D1E00"/>is that death by a ſmall ſlow fire, which they have frequently indured, who have been faithful to the end?</p>
            <p>How many tender-ſpirited proteſtants have been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to ſpend the remainder of their lives in a galley chained to oars, under hard-hearted maſters, while their young children are placed out for education, and taught principles ſo contrary to the conſcience of the parents, that by diſſenting from them, they have hazarded their liberty, lives, and all that was dear to them of the things of this world?</p>
            <p>There have been in time paſt ſevere perſecutions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Engliſh government, and many ſincere-hearted people have ſuſſered death for the teſtimony of a good conſcience, whoſe faithfulneſs in their day hath mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred encouragement to others, and been a bleſſing to many who have ſucceeded them; thus from age to age, the darkneſs being more and more removed, a channel at length, through the tender mercies of God, hath been opened for the exerciſe of the pure gift of the goſpel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, without interruption from outward power, a work, the like of which is rare, and unknown in many parts of the world.</p>
            <p>As theſe things are often freſh in my mind, and this great work of God going on in the earth has been open before me, that liberty of conſcience with which we are favoured, hath appeared not as a light matter.</p>
            <p>A truſt is committed to us, a great and weighty truſt, to which our diligent attention is neceſſary, wherever the active members of this viſible gathered church uſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that which is contrary to the purity of our principles, it appears to be a breach of this truſt, and one ſtep back toward the wilderneſs, one ſtep towards undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what God in infinite love hath done through his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants, in a work of ſeveral ages, and like laying the foundation for future ſufferings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:012630_0010_0F8B927FA815BBE8"/>
I feel a living invitation in my mind to ſuch who are active in our religious ſociety, that we may lay to heart this matter, and conſider the ſtation in which we ſtand; a place of outward liberty under the free exerciſe of our conſcience toward God, not obtained but through great and manifold afflictions of thoſe who lived before us. There is gratitude due from us to our Heavenly Father, and juſtice to our poſterity; can our hearts endure, or our hands be ſtrong, if we deſert a cauſe ſo precious, if we turn aſide from a work under which ſo many have patiently laboured?</p>
            <p>May the deep ſufferings of our Saviour be ſo dear to us, that we nay never trample underfoot the adorable Son of God, nor count the blood of the covenant unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!</p>
            <p>May the faithfulneſs of the martyrs when the proſpect of death by fire was before them, be remembred! and may the patient conſtant ſufferings of the upright-hearted ſervants of God in latter ages be revived in our minds! and may we ſo follow on to know the Lord, that neither the faithful in this age, nor thoſe in ages to come, may ever be brought under ſuffering, through our ſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back from the work of reformation in the world!</p>
            <p>While the active members in the viſible gathered church ſtand upright, and the aſfairs thereof are carried on under the leadings of the Holy Spirit, altho' diſorders may ariſe among us, and cauſe many exerciſes to thoſe who feel the care of the churches upon them; yet while theſe continue under the weight of the work, and labour in the meekneſs of wiſdom for the help of others, the name of Chriſt in the viſible gathered church may be kept ſacred; but while they who are active in the affairs of this church, continue in a manifeſt oppoſition to the purity of our principles, this as the prophet Iſaiah x. 18. expreſſeth it, is like <hi>"as when a ſtandard bearer fainteth,"</hi> and thus the way opens to great, and prevailing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012630_0011_0F8B928058718D98"/>and to ſufferings for ſuch who through the power of Divine Love, are ſeparated to the goſpel of Chriſt, and cannot unite with any thing which ſtands in oppoſition to the purity of it.</p>
            <p>The neceſſity of an inward ſtillneſs, hath under theſe exerciſes appeared clear to my mind; in true ſilence ſtrength is renewed, the mind herein is weaned from all things, but as they may be enjoyed in the Divine Will, and a lowlineſs in outward living oppoſite to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour, becomes truly acceptable to us;—in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after outward gain, the mind is prevented from a perfect attention to the voice of Chriſt, but being weaned from all things, but as they may be enjoyed in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will, the pure light ſhines into the ſoul, and where the fruits of that ſpirit which is of this world, are brought forth by many who profeſs to be lead by the Spirit of Truth, and cloudineſs is felt to be gathering over the viſible gathered church, the ſincere in heart who abide in true ſtillneſs, and are exerciſed therein before the Lord for his name ſake, have a knowledge of Chriſt in the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, and inward thankfulneſs is felt at times, that through Divine Love, our own wiſdom is caſt out, and that forward active part in us ſubjected, which would riſe and do ſomething in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible gathered church, without the pure leadings of the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>While aught remains in us different from a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our wills, it is like a ſeal to a book where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is written <q>that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God concerning us,</q> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 2. but when our minds entirely yield to Chriſt, that ſilence is known, which followeth the opening of the laſt of the ſeals, <hi>Rev.</hi> viii. 1. in this ſilence we learn abiding in the Divine Will, and there feel, that we have no cauſe to promote but that only in which the light of life directs us in our proceedings, and that the alone way to be uſeful in the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012630_0012_0F8B928103687790"/>church of Chriſt, is to abide faithfully under the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his Holy Spirit in all caſes, and being preſerved thereby in purity of heart, and holineſs of converſation, a teſtimony to the purity of his government may be held forth through us, to others.</p>
            <p>As my mind hath been thus exerciſed, I have ſeen that to be active, and buſy in the viſible gathered church, without the leadings of the Holy Spirit is not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable, but tends to increaſe dimneſs, and where way is not opened to proceed in the light of Truth, a ſtop is felt by thoſe who humbly attend to the Divine Leader, a ſtop which in relation to good order in the viſible ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered church, is of the greateſt conſequence to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; thus Robert Barclay in his treatiſe on diſcipline holds forth, page 65, 68, 84. <q>
                  <hi>that the judgment or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the church or congregation, is no further effectual "as to the true end and deſign thereof, but as ſuch judgment "or concluſion proceeds from the Spirit of God operating on their minds who are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this ſtop I have learned the neceſſity of waiting on the Lord in humility, that the works of all may be brought to the light, and thoſe to judgment which are wrought in the wiſdom of this world, and have alſo ſeen, that in a mind thoroughly ſubjected to the power of the Croſs, there is a ſavour of life to be felt, which evidently tends to gather ſouls to God, while the greateſt works in the viſible gathered church brought forth in man's wiſdom, remain to be unprofitable.</p>
            <p>Where people are divinely gathered into a holy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and faithfully abide under the influence of that Spirit which leads into all Truth, "they are the light of the world," <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 14. Now holding this profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to me hath appeared weighty, even beyond what I can fully expreſs, and what our Bleſſed Lord ſeemed to have in view, when he propoſed the neceſſity of counting the coſt, before we begin to build.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:012630_0013_0F8B9281C3CAAC30"/>
I truſt there are many who at times, under Divine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, feel an inward enquiry after God, and when ſuch in the ſimplicity of their hearts mark the lives of a people who profeſs to walk by the leadings of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of what great concernment is it that our lights ſhine clear, that nothing of our conduct carry a contradiction to the Truth as it is in Jeſus, or be a means of profaning his Holy Name, and be a ſtumbling block in the way of thoſe ſincere enquirers.</p>
            <p>When ſuch ſeekers who wearied with empty forms, look toward uniting with us as a people, and behold active members among us depart in their cuſtomary way of living, from that purity of life, which under humbling exerciſes hath been opened before them, as the way of the Lord's people, how mournful and diſcouraging is the proſpect? and how ſtrongly doth ſuch unfaithfulneſs operate againſt the ſpreading of the peaceable, harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principle and teſtimony of Truth amongſt mankind?</p>
            <p>In entering into that life, which is hid with Chriſt in God, we behold his peaceable government, where the whole family are governed by the ſame ſpirit, and the "doing to others as we would they ſhould do unto us," groweth up as good fruit from a good tree, the peace, quietneſs, and harmonious walking in this government is beheld with humble reverence to him who is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it, and in partaking of the Spirit of Chriſt, we partake of that which labours, and ſuffers for the increaſe of this peaceable government among the inhabitants of the world; and I have felt a labour of long continuance that we who profeſs this peaceable principle, may be faithful ſtandard bearers under the Prince of Peace, and that nothing of a defiling nature, tending to diſcord and wars, may remain among us.</p>
            <p>May each of us query with ourſelves, have the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures I poſſeſs, been gathered in that wiſdom which is from above, ſo far as hath appeared to me?</p>
            <p>

Have none of my fellow-creatures an equitable right to any part which is called mine?</p>
            <p>Have the gifts, and poſſeſſions received by me from others been conveyed in a way free from all unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſo far as I have ſeen?</p>
            <p>The principle of peace in which our truſt is only on the Lord, and our minds weaned from a dependance on the ſtrength of armies, hath appeared to me very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and I often feel ſtrong deſires, that we who profeſs this principle, may ſo walk, as to give juſt cauſe for none of our fellow-creatures to be offended at us; that our lives may evidently manifeſt, that we are redeemed from that ſpirit in which wars are: Our bleſſed Saviour in pointing out the danger of ſo leaning on man, as to neglect the leadings of his Holy Spirit, ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>Call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your father which is in heaven,</hi>
               </q> Mat. xxiii. 9. where the wiſdom from above is faithfully followed, and therein we are entruſted with ſubſtance, it is a treaſure committed to our care in the nature of an inheritance, as an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from him, who formed, and ſupports the world. Now in this condition the true enjoyment of the good things of this life is underſtood, and that bleſſing felt, in which is real ſafety; this is what I apprehend our bleſſed Lord had in view, when he pronounced, <q>
                  <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Selfiſh worldly minded men may hold lands in the ſelfiſh ſpirit, and depending on the ſtrength of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward power, be perplexed with ſecret uncaſineſs, leſt the injured ſhould ſometime overpower them, and that meaſure meted to them, which they meaſure to others. —Thus ſelfiſh men may poſſeſs the earth; but it is the meek who inherit it, and enjoy it as an inheritance from the Heavenly Father, free from all the deſilements and perplexities of unrighteouſneſs.</p>

Where proceedings have been in that wiſdom which is from beneath, and inequitable gain gathered by a man, and left as a gift to his children, who being entangled by the ſame worldly ſpirit, have not attained to that clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of light in which the channels of righteouſneſs are opened, and juſtice done to thoſe who remain ſilent under injuries: here I have ſeen under humbling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of mind, that the ſins of the fathers are embraced by the children, and become their ſins, and thus in the days of tribulation, the iniquities of the fathers are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited upon theſe children, who take hold of the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of their fathers, and live in that ſpirit in which thoſe iniquities were committed; to which agreeth the propheſy of Moſes, concerning a rebellious people. <q>
