            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OTHING can be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the God of Peace, than to ſee univerſal Harmony and Benevolence prevail among his Creatures: and He has laid them under the ſtrongeſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to cultivate a pacific Temper towards one another, both as <hi>Individuals,</hi> and as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. "Follow Peace with all Men,"</hi> is one of the principal Precepts of our holy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            </p>
            <p>But when, in this corrupt diſordered State of Things, where the Luſts of Men are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually embroiling the World with Wars and Fightings, and throwing all into Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; when Ambition and Avarice would rob us of our Property, for which we have toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and on which we ſubſiſt; when they would enſlave the free-born Mind, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel us meanly to cringe to Uſurpation and Arbitrary Power; when they would tear

from our eager Graſp the moſt valuable Bleſſing of Heaven, I mean our RELIGION: when they invade our Country, formerly the Region of Tranquility, ravage our Frontiers, butcher our Fellow-Subjects, or confine them in a barbarous Captivity in the Dens of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages; when our <hi>earthly</hi> All is ready to be ſeized by rapacious Hands, and even our <hi>Eternal</hi> All is in Danger by the Loſs of our Religion: when this is the Caſe, what is then the Will of God? Muſt Peace then be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? maintained with our perfidious and cruel Invaders? maintained at the Expence of Property, Liberty, Life, and every Thing dear and valuable? maintained, when it is in our Power to vindicate our Right, and do ourſelves Juſtice? Is the Work of Peace then our only Buſineſs? No; in ſuch a Time even the God of Peace proclaims by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, "To ARMS!" Then the <hi>Sword</hi> is, as it were, <hi>conſecrated</hi> to God; and the Art of WAR becomes a Part of our <hi>Religion.</hi> Then happy is he that ſhall reward our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as they have ſerved us<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſ. cxxxxii 8.</note>. Bleſſed is the brave Soldier: bleſſed is the Defender of his Country, and the Deſtroyer of its Enemies. Bleſſed are they who offer themſelves will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in this Service, and who faithfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it. But on the other Hand,
<q>Curſed is he that doth the Work of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008336_0009_102F32B868498D88"/>
and curſed is he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the original Reference and Meaning of theſe Words, it is ſufficient to my Purpoſe to obſerve, That the <hi>Moabites,</hi> againſt whom this Prophecy was immediately denounced, were a troubleſome and reſtleſs Nation in the Neîghbourhood of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who, though often ſubdued by them, as <hi>France</hi> has been by <hi>England,</hi> yet upon every Occaſion ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled to recover their Power, and renewed their Hoſtilities. By this, and various other Steps, they were arrived to the higheſt Pitch of national Guilt, and ripe for Execution. The <hi>Babylonians</hi> were commiſſioned for this Work of Vengeance: and they were bound to execute the Commiſſion fatihfully, under Penalty of a Curſe. To them this Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation was immediately directed,
<q>Curſed be he that doth the Work of the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully [or negligently]; and curſed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</q>
This is expreſſed in the Form of an <hi>Imprecation,</hi> or an authoritative Denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a Curſe: And in this Form, it might be uſed, conſiſtently with Benevolence, by a Prophet ſpeaking as the Mouth of God. But this is not a Pattern for our Imitation, who are peculiarly obliged under the Goſpel to <hi>"Bleſs, and curſe not,"</hi> and to "pray for all Men."
However, it may be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008336_0010_102F32BAF9C9DE78"/>
even by our Lips as a <hi>Declaration</hi> of the righteous Curſe of God againſt a daſtardly Refuſal to engage in War, when it is our Duty; or a deceitful negligent Diſcharge of that Duty, after we have engaged in it. Theſe are the Crimes that ſeem intended in my Text: and againſt each of theſe the tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous Curſe of JEHOVAH is ſtill in full Force in all Ages, even under the mild and gentle Diſpenſation of the Goſpel. Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Treachery are now as execrable as ever.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Curſed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</q>
—This Denunciation, like the Artillery of Heaven, is leveled againſt the mean, ſneaking Coward, who, when God, in the Courſe of his Providence, calls him to Arms, refuſes to obey, and conſults his own Eaſe and Safety, more than his Duty to God and his Country.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Curſed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully.</q>
—This ſeems to be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled againſt another Species of Cowards; fly, hypocritical Cowards, who undertake the Work of the Lord, that is, take up Arms; but they do the Work of the Lord <hi>deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> that is, they do not faithfully uſe their Arms for the Purpoſes they were taken up. They commence Soldiers, not that they may ſerve their Country, and do their Duty to God, but that they may live in Eaſe, Idleneſs

and Pleaſure, and enrich themſelves at the public Expence. <hi>Curſed is be that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully,</hi> and ſerves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under Pretence of ſerving his Country.</p>
            <p>You Gentlemen and others, whom I this Day behold with peculiar Pleaſure engaged in the Cauſe of your neglected Country, and who have done me the Honour of inviting me to this Service; a Service, which I am ſure I ſhould perform to your Satisfaction, if my Preparations and Abilities were propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to my Benevolence for you, and my Concern for your Succeſs: <hi>You</hi> are peculiarly intereſted in the Remarks I have made upon the Text. And that I may contribute all in my Power both to increaſe your Number, and direct you to a proper Conduct in the honourable Character you ſuſtain, I ſhall lay before you a brief View of the preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our Country, from which it will appear, that the War in which we are engaged is a Duty, or THE WORK OF THE LORD; and conſequently, that we are all obliged, according to our reſpective Characters, to carry it on with Vigour, under Penalty of falling under the Curſe of God. And then I I ſhall ſhew you what is the deceitful Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Lord's Work, or unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly keeping back of the Sword from Blood, which expoſes to the Curſe.</p>

the preſent Circumſtances of our Country, which render the War in which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the Work of the Lord, which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate Swords as Inſtruments of Righteouſneſs, and call us to the dreadful, but important Duty of ſhedding human Blood, upon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of falling under the tremendous Curſe of God.</p>
            <p>Need I inform you what Barbarities and Depredations a mongrel Race of <hi>Indian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages</hi> and <hi>French Papiſts</hi> have perpetrated upon our Frontiers? How many deſerted or demoliſhed Houſes and Plantations! How wide an Extent of Country abandoned! How many poor Families obliged to fly in Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and leave their All behind them! What Breaches and Separations between the neareſt Relations! What painful Ruptures of Heart from Heart! What ſhocking Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions of thoſe once united by the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and moſt endearing Ties! Some lie dead, mangled with ſavage Wounds, conſumed to Aſhes with outrageous Flames, or torn and devoured by the Beaſts of the Wilderneſs, while their Bones lie whitening in the Sun, and ſerve as tragical Memorials of the fatal Spot where they fell. Others have been dragged away Captives, and made the Slaves of imperious and cruel Savages. Others have made their Eſcape, and live to lament their butchered or captivated Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008336_0013_102F32C40B353B70"/>
In ſhort, our Frontiers have been drenched with the Blood of our Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, through the Length of a thouſand Miles: and new Wounds are ſtill opening. We, in theſe inland Parts of the Country, are as yet unmoleſted, through the immerited Mercy of Heaven. But let us glance a Thought to the Weſtern Extremities of our Body Politick; and what melancholy Scenes open to our View! Now, perhaps, while I am ſpeaking; now while you are ſecure and unmoleſted, our Fellow-Subjects there may be feeling the Calamities I am deſcribing. Now, perhaps the ſavage Shouts and Whoops of Indians, and the Screams and Groans of ſome butchered Family, may be mingling their Horrors, and circulating their horren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Echoes thro' the Wilderneſs of Rocks and Mountains. Now, perhaps ſome tender delicate Creature may be ſuffering and invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Proſtitution to ſavage Luſt; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps debauched and murdered by the ſame Hand. Now, perhaps, ſome miſerable Briton or Virginian may be paſſing through a tedious Proceſs of Experiments in the infernal Art of Torture. Now ſome helpleſs Children may be torn from the Arms of their murdered Parents, and dragged away weeping and wringing their Hands, to receive their Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation among Barbarians, and to be formed upon the Model of a ferocius <hi>Indian</hi> Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:008336_0014_102F32C742978360"/>And will theſe Violences ceaſe without a vigorous and timely Reſiſtance from us? Can <hi>Indian</hi> Revenge and Thirſt for Blood be gluted? or can <hi>French</hi> Ambition and Avarice be ſatisfied? No, we have no Method left, but to repel Force with Force, and to give them Blood to drink in their Turn, who have drunk ours. If we ſit ſtill and do nothing, or content ourſelves, as alas we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, with feeble, dilatory Efforts, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect theſe Barbarities will not only continue, but that the Indians, headed by the French, thoſe eternal Enemies of Peace, Liberty and Britons, will carry their Inroads ſtill farther into the Country, and reach even to us. By the Deſertion of our remote Settlements, the Frontiers are approaching every Day nearer and nearer to us: and if we cannot ſtand our Ground now, when we have above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles of a thick-ſettled Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and the Enemy, much leſs ſhall we be able, when our Strength is weakened by ſo vaſt a Loſs of Men, Arms and Riches, and we lie expoſed to their immediate Incurſions. Some cry,
<q>Let the Enemy come down to us, and then we will fight them.</q>
But this is the trifling Excuſe of Cowardice or Security, and not the Language of Prudence and Fortitude. Thoſe who make this Plea, if the Enemy ſhould take them at their Word, and make them ſo near a Viſit, would be as
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008336_0015_102F32C9A692DCD8"/>
forward in Flight, as they are now backward to take up Arms.</p>
            <p>Such, my Brethren, ſuch, alas! is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of our Country: it bleeds in a thouſand Veins; and without a timely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, the Wound will prove mortal. And in ſuch Circumſtances, is it not our Duty in the Sight of God, is it not a Work to which the Lord loudly calls us, to take up Arms for the Defence of our Country? Certainly it is: and "curſed is he," who having no Ties ſufficiently ſtrong to confine him at Home, "keepeth his Sword from Blood." The mean, ſneaking Wretch, that can deſert the Cauſe of his Country in ſuch an Exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; his Country, in the Bleſſings of which he ſhared, while in Peace and Proſperity; and which is therefore intitled to his Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Aſſiſtance in the Day of its Diſtreſs; that cowardly ungrateful Wretch ſins againſt God and his Country, and deſerves the Curſe of both. Such a Conduct in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, is a <hi>moral Evil,</hi> a groſs Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and expoſes the Wretch to the heavy Curſe of God both in this and the eternal World.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but obſerve, that among the various and numberleſs Sins under which our Country groans, and which muſt be looked upon as the Cauſes of our public Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, by every one that believes a divine
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008336_0016_102F32CC0BEDA278"/>
Providence; (a Doctrine ſo comfortable, and ſo eſſential both in Natural and Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion! an Article in the Creed of Heathens and Mahometans, as well as Jews and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;) I ſay among theſe various Sins, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice and Security are none of the leaſt. He that hath determined the Bounds of our Habitation, hath planted us in a Land of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Plenty; a Land, till lately, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alarmed with the Terrors of War, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained with human Blood: Indeed, all Things conſidered, there are but few ſuch happy Spots upon our Globe. And muſt it not highly provoke our divine Benefactor, to ſee a People thus diſtinguiſhed with Bleſſings, ſo inſenſible of their Worth, ſo ungrateful for them, and ſo unacquainted with their own Unworthineſs to receive them? What can be more evidential of their undue Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Worth of theſe Bleſſings, than their being ſo little concerned to ſecure and recover them? The Generality among us have acted, as if their Intereſts at Stake were ſo trifling, that it would not be worth while to take Pains, or encounter Dangers, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them. What greater Evidence can be given of Ingratitude, than a ſupine Neglect of theſe Bleſſings, and ſuch a ſtupidly tame and irreſiſting Reſignation of them into bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and rapacious Hands? And what can be more evidential of a proud Inſenſibility of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008336_0017_102F32CD9CEB4260"/>
our Unworthineſs of ſuch Bleſſings, than our being ſo inapprehenſive of loſing them, even in the moſt threatening and dangerous Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances? Our Countrymen in general have acted, as if Beings of their Importance and Merit might certainly reſt in the quiet unmoleſted Poſſeſſion of their Liberty and Property, without any one daring to diſturb them, and without their doing any Thing for their own Defence: or as if neither God nor Man could ſtrip them of their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What vain ſelf-confident Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what intolerable Inſolence is this, in a ſinful Nation, a People laden with Iniquity, who have forfeited every Bleſſing, even the Ground they tread upon, and the Air they breathe in; and who live meerly by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited Grace, and Bounty of God? Is not Cowardice and Security, or an Unwillingneſs to engage with all our Might in the Defence of our Country, in ſuch a Situation, an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> in the Sight of God, and worthy of his Curſe, as well as a ſcandalous daſtardly <hi>Meanneſs</hi> in the Sight of Men, and worthy of public Shame and Indignation? Is it not fit, that thoſe who ſo contemptuouſly depreciate the rich and undeſerved Bounties of Heaven, and who ſwell ſo inſolently with a vain Conceit of their own Importance and Worth, ſhould be puniſhed with the Loſs of theſe Bleſſings? What Diſcipline can be more
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008336_0018_102F32D0D9697A58"/>
ſeaſonable or congruous? May we not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that divine Providence has permitted our Body Politic to ſuffer Wound after Wound, and baffled all our languid Efforts, in order to give it Senſibility, and rouſe us to exert our Strength in more vigorous Efforts? Has not the Curſe of God lain heavy upon our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, becauſe we have <hi>done the Work of the Lord deceitfully, and kept back our Swords from Blood?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſhall this Guilt increaſe from Year to Year, 'til we are entirely cruſhed with the enormous Load? Shall neither the Fear of <hi>Jehovah's</hi> Curſe, nor the Love of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor even the Love of ourſelves, and our own perſonal Intereſt, conſtrain us at Length to relieve our ravaged Country, and defend the Bleſſings which God has entruſted to our <hi>Cuſtody,</hi> as well as lent us to <hi>enjoy?</hi>—Bleſſed be God, and Thanks to you, brave Soldiers, for what I now ſee. I ſee you engaged in this good Cauſe: and may the effectual <hi>Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Heaven be upon you, inſtead of the Curſe entailed upon Cowardice and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery! But are there no more to join with you? what! none more in this Crowd? None more in <hi>Hanover?</hi> which I think ſhould ſhew itſelf worthy of Precedence, and exhibit a brave Example to other Counties: this Is what may be reaſonably expected, from the Number of our Militia, the high Price of our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008336_0019_102F32D335DA7FC0"/>
Staple Commodity, the Frequency and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of our religious Inſtructions; and I may add, from our own former good Conduct in ſuch an Emergency. <hi>Hanover</hi> had the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of ſending out the firſt Company of Volunteers, that were raiſed in the Colony. <note n="*" place="bottom">Under Captain <hi>Averton,</hi> immediately after General <hi>Braddock</hi>'s Defeat.</note> And are we degenerated ſo ſoon? Or is our Danger leſs now, than immediately after <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock</hi>'s Defeat? Or are we now inured and hardened to bad News, ſo that the Calamities of our Frontiers, which have been growing every Year, have now ceaſed to be Objects of our Compaſſion?</p>
            <p>I am ſorry to tell you, that the Company now forming, is not yet compleated, though under Officers from among yourſelves, from whom you may expect good Uſage; and the Encouragement is ſo unuſually great, and the Time of Service ſo ſhort. <note n="‖" place="bottom">Only 'til the firſt of <hi>December</hi> next.</note> May I not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably inſiſt upon it, that the Company be made up this very Day before we leave this Place? Methinks your King, your Country, nay, your own Intereſts command me: and therefore I muſt inſiſt upon it.—Oh! for the all-prevailing Force of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>'s Oratory —but I recall my Wiſh, that I may correct it—Oh! for the Influence of the Lord of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the God of Battles, the Author of true
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008336_0020_102F32D5DFC06EE8"/>
Courage, and every heroic Virtue, to fire you into Patriots and Soldiers this Moment!—Ye young and hardy Men, whoſe very Faces ſeem to ſpeak that God and Nature formed you for Soldiers, who are free from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance of Families depending upon you for Subſiſtence, and who are perhaps but of little Service to Society, while at Home, may I not ſpeak for you, and declare as your Mouth,
<q>Here we are, all ready to abandon our Eaſe, and ruſh into the glorious Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Field, in Defence of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try?</q>
Ye that love your Country, enliſt: for Honour will follow you in Life or Death in ſuch a Cauſe. You that love your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion enliſt: for your Religion is in Danger. Can <hi>Proteſtant Chriſtianity</hi> expect Quarters from <hi>Heathen Savages</hi> and <hi>French Papiſts?</hi> Sure in ſuch an Alliance, the <hi>Powers of Hell</hi> make a third Party. Ye that love your Friends and Relations, enliſt; leſt ye ſee them enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or butchered before your Eyes. Ye that would catch at Money, here is a proper Bait for you; ten Pounds for a few Months Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, beſides the uſual Pay of Soldiers. I ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly make the Propoſal to you, not only as a Subject of the beſt of Kings, and a Friend to your Country, but as <hi>a Servant of the moſt High God:</hi> for I am fully perſwaded what I am recommending, is his Will; and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to it may expoſe you to his Curſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:008336_0021_102F32D7A3827C10"/>This Propoſal is not liable to the Objection that have been urged againſt former Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for raiſing Men. You can no longer object,
<q>that you are dragged away like Slaves againſt your Wills, while others are without Reaſon exempted:</q>
for now it is left to your own Honour, and you may act as free Men. Nor can you object,
<q>that you are arbitrarily thruſt under the Command of foreign, unknown, or diſagreeable Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers:</q>
for the Gentleman that has the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Command of this Company, and his ſubordinate Officers, are of yourſelves, your Neighbours Children, and perhaps your old Companions. And I hope I may add, you need not object, that you ſhall be badly uſed: for, GENTLEMEN-OFFICERS, may I not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for you, that not one Man in your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhall be treated with Cruelty or Injuſtice, as far as your Authority or Influence can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? May I not be your Security, that none but the Guilty ſhall be puniſhed, and they only according to the Nature of the Offence? Perhaps ſome may object, that ſhould they enter the Army, their Morals would be in Danger of Infection, and their Virtue would be perpetually ſhocked with horrid Scenes of Vice. This may alſo be a Diſcouragement to Parents to conſent to their Childrens en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in ſo good a Cauſe. I am glad to hear this Objection, when it is ſincere, and not an
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008336_0022_102F32DBB1B21778"/>
empty Excuſe: and I wiſh I could remove it, by giving you a univerſal Aſſurance, that the Army is a School of Religion; and that Soldiers, as they are more expoſed to Death than other Men, are proportionably better prepared for it than others. But alas! the Reverſe of this is too true; and the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Vice and Irreligion is perhaps no where ſtronger than in the Army; where, one would think, the ſupreme Tribunal ſhould be always in View, and it ſhould be their chief Care to prepare for Eternity, on the ſlippery Brink of which they ſtand every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But, GENTLEMEN-OFFICERS, I muſt again appeal to you, that as for this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, you will not willingly allow any Form of Vice to be practiſed in it with Impunity; but will always endeavour to recommend and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force Religion and good Morals by your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and Authority, and to ſuppreſs the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? May I not give the Public the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſuch an Aſſurance concerning you, that whatever others do, as for you and your Company you will ſerve the Lord? Do you not own yourſelves bound to this in Honour and Duty? Such a Conduct I can aſſure you, will render you popular among the Wiſe and Good; tho' perhaps it may expoſe you to the ſenſeleſs Contempt of Fools, who <hi>make a Mock of Sin,</hi> and who eſteem it Bravery to inſult that God <hi>in whoſe Hand their Breath is,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008336_0023_102F32DD7AB46970"/>
and whoſe are all their ways.</hi> Such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will afford you Pleaſure in the Review, when the Terrors of the bloody Field are ſpread round you, and Death ſtarts up before you in a thouſand ſhocking Forms. Such a Conduct will be a Source of true Courage, and render you nobly indifferent about Life or Death in a good Cauſe. And let me honeſtly warn you, that if you do not maintain ſuch a Conduct, you will bitterly repent it either in Time, or Eternity.</p>
            <p>But I return to invite others to join with you in this important Expedition.—What a Crowd of important Arguments preſs you on every Hand? What can our Legiſlature do more, than they have done to engage you? If ſuch unuſual Encouragement does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon you to enliſt as <hi>Volunteers,</hi> what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but that you muſt be <hi>forced</hi> to it by Authority? For our Country <hi>muſt</hi> be defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and if nothing but <hi>Force</hi> can conſtrain you to take up Arms in its Defence, then Force <hi>muſt</hi> be uſed: Perſons of ſuch a ſordid unmanly Spirit, are not to expect the Uſage of <hi>Freemen.</hi>—Think what the paternal Care of our Sovereign has done for us: and how many Millions of Money, and Thouſands of Men our Mother-Country has furniſhed for our Defence. And ſhall we do nothing for ourſelves? Great-Britain, I own is inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in our Protection: but can ſhe be as
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008336_0024_102F32DF1C7DEE18"/>
much intereſted as ourſelves?—Conſider what the brave <hi>New-England</hi> Men have done, after ſo many Mortifications and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, and their Treaſury ſo much exhauſted. By the beſt Accounts I have had, the little Colony of <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay</hi> has raiſed no leſs than 7000 Men, tho' not larger perhaps than 15 or 20 of thoſe 53 Counties contained in <hi>Virginia.</hi> And ſince we have the ſame Intereſts at Stake, ſhall not we chearfully furniſh our Quota for the public Service?—We all admire the Bravery and Succeſs of the King of <hi>Pruſſia:</hi> but his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs muſt be greatly owing to the Bravery of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> as well as his <hi>own.</hi> He has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many Soldiers as Subjects. And while he has almoſt <hi>miraculouſly</hi> ſtood his Ground againſt ſuch ſuperior Numbers, ſhall we, with the Advantage of Numbers on our Side, be perpetually flying before a pitiful Enemy, and tamely give up our Country to their Ravages? Let us ſtrenuouſly exert that ſuperior Force, which a gracious Providence has put in our Hands: and we may ſoon expect, thro' the Concurrence of Heaven, that we ſhall again enjoy the Bleſſings of Peace. Whatever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence our artful Enemies may ſend, or the Cowardly among ourſelves may believe<note n="*" place="bottom">It is generally believed, that all the expenſive preparations of laſt Year were rendered fruitleſs, by falſe Accounts of the ſuperior Number of the Enemy at <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

there is no Reaſon to conclude, that the <hi>French Regulars</hi> upon this Continent are half ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as ours: and as to the <hi>Coloni,</hi> or Country Militia, we are certainly 20, perhaps 40, to one. Let us then, in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts, the God of the Armies of Iſrael, let us collect our whole Strength, and give one deciſive Blow; and we may humbly hope Victory will be ours.</p>
            <p>Every one can complain of the bad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of our public Undertakings, and lament the general Security and Inactivity that prevails. Every one can wiſh that Something were effectually done, and that this and that Perſon would enliſt. Every one can tell what great Atchievements he <hi>would</hi> perform, were it not for this and that, and a hundred Obſtructions in his Way. But this idle Complaining, Wiſhing and Lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Boaſting, will anſwer no End. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE! muſt be done BY YOU! Therefore, inſtead of aſſuming the State of Patriots and Heroes at home TO ARMS! and away to the Field, and prove your Pretenſions ſincere. Let the Thunder of this Imprecation rouſe you out of your Eaſe, and Security,
<q>Curſed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully; and curſed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</q>
God ſent an Angel from Heaven to curſe the daſtardly Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008336_0026_102F32E428D4D1E0"/>
of Meroz, who refuſed to take up Arms for the Defence of their Country. (Judges v. 23.)
<q>Curſe ye Meroz, ſaid the Angel of the Lord, curſe ye bitterly the Inhabitants thereof: becauſe they came not to the Help of the Lord, to the Help of the Lord againſt the Mighty.</q>
And ſhall this Curſe fall upon Virginia? no, fly from it by ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing your Lives for your Country: for this Curſe is far more terrible than any Thing that can befal you in the Field of Battle.— But it is not enough for you to <hi>undertake</hi> this Work: you are alſo obliged <hi>faithfully to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> it, as the Work of the Lord. And this leads me,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſhew you, what is that deceitful Performance of the Lord's Work, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable keeping back the Sword from Blood, which expoſes to his Curſe.</p>
            <p>If Soldiers, inſtead of abandoning their Eaſe and Pleaſure, and riſquing their Lives in Defence of their Country, ſhould unman themſelves with ſenſual Pleaſures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery; if, inſtead of ſearching out the Enemy, they keep out of their Way, leſt they ſhould ſearch out and find them; if they lie ſleeping or rioting in Forts and Places of Safety, while their Country is ravaged, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in their very Neighbourhood: when they waſte their Courage in Broils and Duels among themſelves, or in tyrannizing over
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008336_0027_102F32E89606BF88"/>
thoſe that are under their Command: when they lay themſelves open to falſe Alarms, by being credulous to every Account that mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Force of the Enemy: when they are tedious or divided in their Conſultations, and ſlow and faint in the Execution: when they conſult rather what may be moſt <hi>ſafe for themſelves,</hi> than moſt <hi>beneficial to their Country:</hi> when they keep ſkirmiſhing at a Diſtance, inſtead of making a bold Puſh, and bringing the War to a ſpeedy Iſſue by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive Stroke: when they are fond of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing the War, that they may live and riot the longer at the public Expence: when they ſell themſelves and their Country to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for a Bribe: in ſhort, when they do not conſcientiouſly exert all their Power to repel the Enemy, and protect the State that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys them, but only ſeek to ſerve themſelves, then they <hi>do the Work of the Lord deceitfully;</hi> and his Curſe lights upon them as their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Doom. I leave others to judge, whether the Original of this ugly Picture is to be found any where in the Univerſe, But as for you of this Company, may I not preſume that you will behave in a noble Manner? Shall not So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, public Spirit, Courage, Fidelity, and good Diſcipline be maintained among you? This I humbly recommend to you; and may God enable you to act accordingly!</p>
            <p>Thus far have I addreſſed you as <hi>Soldiers,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:008336_0028_102F32EA272B63B8"/>
or at leaſt as Perſons concerned in your Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to do all in your Power to ſave your Country. But we muſt not part thus. It is poſſible we may never meet more, 'til we mingle with the aſſembled Univerſe before the ſupreme Tribunal: Therefore, before I diſmiſs you, I muſt addreſs myſelf to you as <hi>Sinners</hi> and as <hi>Candidates for Eternity.</hi> You are concerned to ſave your <hi>Souls,</hi> as well as your <hi>Country;</hi> and ſhould you ſave or gain a Kingdom, or even the whole World, and loſe your Souls, your Loſs will be irreparable.</p>
            <p>None of you I hope will reply,
<q>I am now a Soldier, and have nothing more to do with Religion?</q>
What! has a Soldier Nothing to do with Religion? Is a Soldier under no Obligations to the God that made him, and that furniſhes him with every Bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Is not a Soldier as much expoſed to Death as other Men? May not a Soldier be damned for Sin, as well as other Sinners? And will he be able to dwell with devouring Fire and everlaſting Burnings? Are theſe Things ſo? Can any of you be ſo ſtupid as to think them ſo? If not, you muſt own, that even a <hi>Soldier</hi> has as much Concern with Religion, as another. Therefore hear me ſeriouſly upon this Head.</p>
            <p>You are about entering into <hi>the School of Vice:</hi> for ſuch the Army has generally been. And are any of you already initiated into any

of the Myſteries of Iniquity there practiſed? Muſt I ſo much as ſuppoſe, that ſome of you, who have bravely eſpouſed the Cauſe of your Country, are addicted to Drunkenneſs, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whoredom, or any groſs Vice? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now take Time to reaſon with you for your Conviction: it may ſuffice to appeal to your own Reaſon and Conſcience, Do you do well in indulging theſe Vices? Will you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it in the honeſt Hour of Death? Will this Conduct prove a Source of Courage to you, when the Arrows of Death are fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thick around you, and Scores are falling on every Side? No, you are ſelf-condemned; and may I not reaſonably hope, you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reform, what you cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn? Soldiers indeed, are too commonly addicted to ſuch Immoralities: but are they the better Soldiers on that Account? Can an Oath or a Debauch inſpire them with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Fortitude againſt the Fears of Death? Would not Prayer and a Life of Holineſs better anſwer this Purpoſe? Their Courage, if they have any, muſt be the Effect, not of Thought, but of the <hi>Want</hi> of Thought; it muſt be a brutal Stupidity, or Ferocity; but not the rational Courage of a Man or a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</p>
            <p>Some of you, I doubt not, are happily free from theſe groſs Vices: and long may you continue ſo! but I muſt tell you, this <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:008336_0030_102F32EEFB1D06B0"/>
Goodneſs is not enough to prepare you for Death, or to conſtitute you true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. The Temper of your Minds muſt be changed by the Power of divine Grace; and you muſt be turned from the Love and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all Sin, to the Love and Practice of univerſal Holineſs. You muſt become hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, broken-hearted Penitents, and true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> You muſt be enabled to live righteouſly, ſoberly, and godly, in this preſent evil World. This is Religion: this is Religion that will keep you incorrupted in the midſt of Vice and Debauchery: this is Religion, that will befriend you, when Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons roar, and Swords gleam around you, and you are every Moment expecting the deadly Wound: this is Religion, that will ſupport you in the Agonies of Death, and aſſure you of a happy Immortality.</p>
            <p>But are not ſome of you conſcious, that you are deſtitude of ſuch a Religion as this? Then it is high Time for you to think on your Condition in ſober Sadneſs. Pray to that powerful and gracious Being, who can form your Hearts and Lives after this ſacred Model. Oh! pray earneſtly, pray frequently, for this Bleſſing: and uſe all the Means of Grace in that Manner which your Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will permit.—Remember alſo, that if you try to prolong your Life by a daſtardly Conduct, your Life will lie under the Curſe
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008336_0031_102F32F16A7B7918"/>
of Heaven; and you have little Reaſon to hope, you will ever improve it as a Space for Repentance.—Remember alſo to put your Confidence in God; who keeps the Thread of your Life, and the Event of War, in his own Hand. Devoutly acknowledge his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in all your Ways, and be ſenſible of your Dependance upon it.</p>
            <p>And now, to conclude my Addreſs to you, as the Mouth of this Multitude, and of your Countrymen in general, I heartily bid you farewel. Farewel, my dear Friends, my brave Fellow-Subjects, the Guardians of your poor ravaged Country. God grant you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in Safety and Honour, and that we may yet welcome you Home, crowned with Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Victory! Or if any of you ſhould loſe your Lives in ſo good a Cauſe, may you enjoy a glorious and bleſſed Immortality in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of everlaſting Peace and Tranquility! Methinks I may take upon me to promiſe you the Prayers and good Wiſhes of Thouſands. Thouſands, whom you leave behind, will think of you with affectionate Anxiety, will wiſh you Succeſs, and congratulate your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, or lament your Death. Once more I pour out all my Heart in another affectionate Farewel. May the Lord preſerve your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, and your Coming in, from this Time forth and even for evermore. Amen.</p>
            <p>Here I thought to have concluded. But
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008336_0032_102F32F40B1BAC78"/>
I muſt take up a few Minutes more to aſk this Crowd, Is there Nothing to be done by us who ſtay at Home, towards the Defence of our Country, and to promote the Succeſs of the Expedition now in Hand? Shall we ſin on ſtill impenitent and incorrigible? Shall we live as if we and our Country were <hi>ſelf-depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and had nothing to do with the Supreme Ruler of the Univerſe? Can an Army of <hi>Saints</hi> or of <hi>Heroes</hi> defend an obnoxious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ripe for Deſtruction, from the righteous Judgment of God? The Cauſe in which theſe brave Men, and our Army in general, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, is not ſo much their own as <hi>ours:</hi> Divine Providence conſiders them not ſo much in their <hi>private perſonal</hi> Character, as in their <hi>public</hi> Character, as the <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> and Guardians of their Country: and therefore they will ſtand or fall, not ſo much according to their own <hi>perſonal</hi> Character, as according to the <hi>public</hi> Character of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe Cauſe they have undertaken. Be it known to you, then, their Succeſs depends upon <hi>us,</hi> even more than upon themſelves. Therefore let us all turn every one from his evil Ways.
<q>Let the Wicked forſake his Way, &amp;c.</q>
Let us humble ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mighty Hand of God, which is lifted up over our guilty Heads, that we may be exalted in due Time. I could venture the Reputation of my Judgment and Veracity,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008336_0033_102F32F5C3D16AC0"/>
that it will never be well with our Country, 'til there be more of the Fear and Love of God in it, and 'til the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi> be of more Importance among us. I could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a Method for our Deliverance, which is at once infallible, and alſo cheap, and ſafe, and ſo far from endangering the Life of any, that it would ſecure the everlaſting Life of all that comply with it. Ye that complain of the Burden of our public Taxes; ye that love Eaſe and ſhrink from the Dangers of War; ye that wiſh to ſee Peace reſtored once more; ye that would be happy beyond the Grave, and live for ever, attend to my Propoſal: It is this, A THOROUGH NATIONAL REFORMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION. This will do, what Millions of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Thouſands of Men, with Guns and Swords and all the dreadful Artillery of Death, could not do; it will procure us Peace again; a laſting well-eſtabliſhed Peace. We have tried other Expedients without this long enough: Let us now try this new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, the Succeſs of which I dare to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.—And do not object, that ſuch a <hi>general</hi> Reformation is beyond your Power; for a general Reformation muſt begin with <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals:</hi> therefore do you, through the Grace of God, do <hi>your</hi> Part; Begin <hi>at Home,</hi> and endeavour to reform yourſelves, and thoſe under your Influence.</p>
            <p>It is a natural Inference from what has
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008336_0034_102F32F991B13878"/>
been ſaid, that if the Defence of our Country, in which we can ſtay but a few Years at moſt, and from which we muſt 'ere long take our Flight, be ſo important a Duty, then how much more are we obliged to
<q>ſeek a better Country, i. e. an heavenly;</q>
and to carry on a vigorous War againſt our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Enemies, that would rob us of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inheritance? Therefore in the Name of JESUS, the Captain of your Salvation, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you all to enliſt in the ſpiritual Warfare. Now proclaim eternal War againſt all Sin. Now
<q>take to you the whole Armour of God: quit you like Men, be ſtrong.</q>
And for your Encouragement, remember,
<q>He that overcometh, ſhall inherit all Things:</q>
He ſhall enter into a Kingdom that cannot be <hi>ſhaken.</hi>—cannot be ſhaken with thoſe Storms of public Calamities which toſs and agitate this reſtleſs Ocean of a World. In that bleſſed Harbour may we all reſt at laſt!</p>
