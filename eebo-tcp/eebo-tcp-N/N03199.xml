            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR repeated requeſt, the reaſons you have offer'd, together with the importunity of ſome other my Friends, have at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with me to grant you a Copy of that Sermon, I preach'd ſome time ago, at your Lecture: In doing which, I have preferr'd your judgment before my own; and have ſought to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy you herein, rather than to pleaſe my ſelf.</p>
            <p>For to me it appears, that I have little conſulted my own Reputation herein. The World will cenſure me, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing at all in Print, who am but of yeſterday; and the Copy which I have here ſent you, is one, but haſtily corrected, which ſome time ago I tranſcribed for the uſe of a private Perſon only; being by an extraordinary diſpenſation of Providence (of which you heard) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb facs="unknown:003871_0003_10020827035B6BB8"/>
from preparing a more correct Copy for you, as I had given encouragement to do; however, I don't think it worth while for me to go about to excuſe my ſelf, by telling under what diſadvantages this comes forth; nor yet, by declaring to the World, my unwillingneſs to come into this. You Sirs, and other my Friends, know how the matter was; And I hope it now is, and ever will be, more my concern, that I be able to give a goal account to God, and my own Conſcience than to any Man on Earth.</p>
            <p>I have made little alteration in this Copy from what you heard me preach; and doubt not, but that it is the truth, which I ought to teach and maintain, tho' it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in a very plain dreſs, and will find but a very indifferent reception with many. And indeed, your pious zeal and forwardneſs to promote the ſpreading &amp; eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Truths, in which you are ſo well eſtabliſhed, and built up, hath been a principal motive with me, to adventure thus to expoſe my ſelf.</p>
            <p>And I hope it will ſtill be your care, as well as mine, to do what you may for the propagating and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe fundamental Truths, which are but growing out of faſhion at this Day.</p>
            <p>But if it will pleaſe God (who can work by any means) by his Grace and Bleſſing, to make this mean Eſſay ſerviceable, for the promoting and eſtabliſhing of his Truth in the Minds and Hearts of any, that his great Name may have the Glory, and precious Souls the benefit, then your end in Printing, and mine in Writing, will be attain'd.</p>

               <hi>Death, by Man came alſo the Reſurrection of the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he further illuſtrates and confirms this in my Text, <hi>For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive</hi>; i. e. as thro' the Sin of the firſt Adam all Men became mortal, becauſe all derive from him the ſame ſinful Nature;—ſo through the obedience and merits of Chriſt, ſhall all that are made partakers of the divine Nature, be made both alive and immortal. All that died, died in Adam, all that ever are made alive, are made alive in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But in the Words we may further,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerve, The Perſons treated of, <hi>viz</hi> Adam and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the firſt and the ſecond Adam.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obſerve, That both are ſpoken or treated of, as publick Perſons, Heads, or Repreſentatives. And this is evident from the form of the Apoſtle's reaſoning, wherein he ſhews that Adam did not act in a ſingle capacity for himſelf alone, but as a publick Head for all mankind, therefore <hi>is it</hi> that all die in him; i. e. as in their publick Head: For in no other ſenſe could they die in him. And that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>was and is</hi> ſuch a publick Perſon, not only the Apoſtle here, but alſo the whole Goſpel witneſſeth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſerve, The <hi>influence,</hi> and <hi>effects,</hi> that the acts and doings of theſe publick Perſons <hi>had,</hi> and <hi>have</hi> on thoſe they repreſent and act for, viz. <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> Adam conveys Death to all he acted for: Jeſus Chriſt Life to all his. <hi>In Adam all die,</hi> i. e not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came guilty with him in the firſt Sin conveyed to them in the channel of natural Generation, to the expoſing all his progeny to temporal and eternal Death; but
<pb facs="unknown:003871_0006_100266E1D64D9C28"/>
the Phraſe alſo denote, the conveyance of ſuch a co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ruption of Nature ſo communicated to all who abide in him, as is daily working Death in them.</p>
            <p>But now! the Lord Jeſus Chriſt coming in as Man's ſecond common and covenant Head, for his deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from this Death, and fulfilling both the penal and preceptive parts of the Law, hath hereby aboliſhed this Death, and purchaſed for his People a title to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal Life; which by his Grace and Spirit he conveys &amp; communicates <hi>in effectual Vocation</hi> to all, as many as the Father hath given him.</p>
            <p>And ſo a Number of thoſe who were dead in Adam, are thus again recover'd and made alive in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> then is plainly this, viz.</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>That as Adam brought in, and communicates Death to all his natural Seed: So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath brought in, and communicates Life to all his ſpiritual Seed.</hi> Text, <hi>As in Adam all die, ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive</hi>; i. e. all that ever are made alive.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour to illuſtrate and clear up this Doctrinal Truth, by ſpeaking to theſe <hi>five</hi> things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>That both Adam and Jeſus Chriſt, were treated with, and acted as publick Perſons, Heads, or Repreſentatives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>That both Adam and Jeſus Chriſt had, and have a Seed, whom they ſo repreſented and acted for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. III. <hi>That as both Adams had, and have a Seed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo both their acts and influences are communicated to their Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. IV. <hi>That the one of theſe publick Heads con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys Death with all the curſed influence of original Sin and Pollution: The other conveys Life with all the fruits of Grace, and bleſſings of Salvation to his Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003871_0007_100266E543994F78"/>PROP. V. <hi>That each of theſe communications are made much in the ſame way and manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>That both Adam and Jeſus Chriſt, were treated with, and acted as publick Perſons, Heads, or Repreſentatives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this reſpect Adam was indeed a Type of Chriſt, did repreſent and reſemble him, and is ſo ſpoken of in the Scripture on this account, Rom. 5 14.—<hi>Which was the figure of him that was to come.</hi> Adam was the Head of the firſt Covenant; and ſo was treated with, <hi>for</hi> and <hi>inſtead</hi> of all Mankind. He was the common Head and ſurety of all Mankind, acted for them, and repreſented them, as the Deputy of a Town, Colony, or any Corporation acts for, and repreſents thoſe who chooſe and ſend him.</p>
            <p>God was pleaſed to call and appoint him to this Office, to treat with him in a Covenant way as ſuch a common Head and publick Perſon; did ſo plight a Covenant with him, wherein Adam became ingaged for, and charged with all his Children that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from him; that he was to act for them, and they to ſtand to what their Covenant Head did: If he ſhould punctually obey, his Obedience was to be ours too, and we to receive the benefit, if he ſhould diſobey, the act was to be ours too; we muſt ſtand and fall in our federal Head, we were in his Loins, he our Root in which we grew, and we acted in him, or with him, or by him. This is evidently implied in the Text, and further cleared up in other paragraphs of holy writ, particularly in Rom. 5.12, 17, 18. Here the Apoſtle plumply aſſerts that <hi>Sin came into the World</hi> by Adam, <hi>and Death by Sin; and that this Death hath paſſed</hi> or fallen <hi>on all Men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> i. e. in Adam their publick Head. And in the 17 and 18 verſes, he tells us to what ſad <hi>Effect</hi> this hath paſſed on all, <hi>even unto Condemnation</hi>: And that this Death hath a ſovereign power over, or reigning influence in the Hearts of Men, that they die in Adam daily.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:003871_0008_100266E6C8D02A20"/>Thus the holy Scripture looks upon, or repreſents all Men in their natural or unregenerate State, dead in Adam, and condemned with him in Law. But how could this be, were he not our publick Head, were he not ſo looked upon &amp; treated with in the firſt Covenant? Where would be the Juſtice of ſuch a conveyance of Sin, Guilt, and Death, to all his Poſterity? Beſides 'tis evident he did ſtand in the place of ſuch a publick Perſon, and acted as ſuch, <hi>becauſe</hi> the Scriptures ſpeak of him as ſuch an one, placing him in oppoſition to Chriſt who is the ſecond publick Head: So in the 47th ver. of our Context, <hi>The firſt Man is of the Earth earthy, the ſecond Man is the Lord from Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what! Tho' Mankind was not then capable to depute him to this Office by their own Choice, or Vote; yet infinite Wiſdom knew, who was the fitteſt Perſon to be deputed to this publick Truſt, and therefore could make as wiſe a Choice for us, as we could have made for our ſelves; and 'tis clear the fitteſt Perſon was in fact Choſen; ſo that we can't complain of any injuſtice done us on this account.</p>
            <p>Well! As Adam, ſo Jeſus Chriſt is alſo a publick Head and Repreſentative: he is Head of the ſecond, as Adam was of the firſt Covenant. Chriſt is the Head of all the Elect; he was treated with as ſuch, acted for them, ſuffered for them, bea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Wrath of God in their room and ſtead, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ied the juſt for the unjuſt, their Sins were charged to him, layed upon him; and he bear the puniſhment of them, Iſai. 53.5, 6. <hi>And the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Elect were in the eternal <hi>Decree,</hi> involved and wrap'd up with Chriſt in the firſt Covenant, even from Eternity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4 And as ſoon as Man fell, Chriſt actually undertook for all the Elect, became ſurety to his Father on their account, that ſo by his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal acts, he might do away Sin and preſent his Elect to the Father guiltleſs and blameleſs in and by his own ſufferings and merits. And God was pleaſed to accept him as ſuch a Surety, and to plight ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003871_0009_100266E849E49F90"/>
with him, and publickly declares his royal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and approbation of Chriſt in this Office, when he did actually appear in the World, to execute that for which he had ſo undertaken, as in Mat. 3.17. <hi>And lo, a Voice from Heaven, ſaying, this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was by virtue of this early undertaking of Chriſt, as a publick Head, and his becoming ſecurity to the Father for all the Elect, that the Patriarchs and holy Men of old were ſaved. For inaſmuch as he was become Surety, and was to obey and ſuffer for them in time; the Law therefore looked on all that were in him thro' believing, as having really ſuffered the penalty and yielded the obedience required, and ſo as having fulfilled the Law of the firſt Covenant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt was become <hi>Surety,</hi> had put in his <hi>Bond</hi> for us; become engaged to Juſtice to do all for his Elect, <hi>when the fulneſs of time ſhould come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus alſo when he did actually come in the Fleſh, and did in our Nature obey and ſuffer, he did this as a publick Perſon for us, in our room and ſtead: Hence that 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>For God hath made him to be Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he now appears before the Father in Heaven as our publick Head, he is <hi>there</hi> our Advocate to plead our Cauſe, preſent our Services, and to procure for us all that good which we ſtand in need of, and pray for. So the Apoſtle teacheth, 1 John 2.1. <hi>We have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence,</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>That Both Adam and Jeſus Chriſt had, and have a Seed whom they ſo repreſented and acted for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All for whom they acted, and to whom they ſtand in in the relation of a common or publick Head, are their Seed. Adam was not only the natural Parent, but alſo the federal Head of all Mankind; as they are deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants from him, and in their natural eſtate, they are
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003871_0010_100207F30BD03350"/>
his Seed; his <hi>natural</hi> Seed, his <hi>Covenant</hi> Seed, branches of the ſame Stock ſprang from the ſame Root; Before we had our being in the World, we were virtually in Adam's Loins, as the effect is in the Cauſe, or as fruit is firſt in the Tree, before it is brought forth, or hath any actual Exiſtence.— Thus in this very ſenſe as I take it, the Tribe of Levi, is ſaid to pay tithes in Abraham, long before Levi the Father of that Tribe was born, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9.</p>
            <p>And when we actually have our being in the World, we are actually in Adam as our Covenant Head, are his Seed; and hence as one obſerves, <hi>it is</hi> that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſaid to be of one Blood, Acts 17.26. <hi>And hath made of one Blood all Nations of Men.</hi>—We are in Covenant looked upon not only as the natural Seed of Adam, as we ſpring from him in natural Generation; but alſo as his Covenant Seed and Children for whom he acted, and in whom we both ſtand and fall.</p>
            <p>Well! as Adam, ſo the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath alſo a Seed: He alſo undertook as a Covenant Head, or publick Perſon to tranſact for Man, and to purchaſe to himſelf an <hi>holy</hi> Seed out of the ruined Rubiſh, and fallen race of old Adam; that thereby he might bring <hi>many Sons home to Glory at laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When God called him to this his Office, according to Pſal. 40 7. <hi>Then ſaid I, lo, I come, &amp;c.</hi> i. e. in anſwer to the call of the Father; then did the Father promiſe him ſuch a Seed, to be the reward of his undertaking, Iſai. 53.10 <hi>When thou ſhalt make his Soul an offering for Sin, he ſhall ſee his Seed,</hi> &amp;c. And again ver. 11. <hi>He ſhall ſee of the travail of his Soul and be ſatisfied, by his knowlege ſhall thy righteous Servant juſtify many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the Elect were Chriſt's appointed Seed in the eternal Decree of Election, ſo choſen in him, according to Eph. 1.4, 5. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the Foundation of the World, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love: Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated us unto the Adoption of Children, by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003871_0011_100266E9D9DDBFF8"/>And all the <hi>faithful</hi> upon their actual believing, become his real Seed. Faith takes them out of old Adam, Grace cuts them out of the old Stock and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafs them into the true Olive, the new Covenant, the ſecond Adam, whereby they become his Seed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>But this brings me to the third thing, <hi>viz</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. III. <hi>That as both Adams have a Seed, ſo both their acts and influence are communicated to their Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this neceſſarily follows from the former: For if both were publick Perſons or Repreſentatives, and both had and have a Seed for whom they, in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick capacity acted, and who were involved and wrapt up with them in the Covenant, Adam's Seed with him in the <hi>firſt,</hi> Chriſt's Seed with him in the ſecond <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>; then both their acts and doings, muſt needs be communicated to their Seed, ſo far forth as they acted in this their publick capacity. Indeed their Seed did <hi>really act</hi> in them, or with them, or by them; as a Town acts with and by their Repreſentative, or a Colony by their Agent; whoſe acts and influence ſo far forth as he acts properly, in his publick capacity, muſt needs be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative to all for whom, and in whoſe name he ſo acts</p>
            <p>And as by the general Vote of mankind, ſuch a depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of one to repreſent, and act for the whole body, in caſes civil, is allowed to be juſt; ſo it is certainly no leſs juſt in this caſe. Nor can any one juſtly complain of his being wronged, or layed under any diſadvantage by his being ſo in, or repreſented by Adam: for it is certain they acted no otherways in him than they would have acted out of him; for the nature of every one being juſt the ſame with his, they would have done juſt as <hi>Adam</hi> did, if put upon the ſame trial as he was.— So that it was every whit as well; <hi>yea</hi> and on ſome accounts at leaſt, more ſafe for his Children to act in, and by him, then it would have been for them to have acted ſingly for themſelves, &amp; each one to have made his own Choice.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003871_0012_100266ED56868E48"/>
For it is certain that the happineſs of his whole Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (whom nature would make dear to him) being concerned in the Affair, as well as his own happineſs, could not but lay him under far greater moral engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to take heed what he did, and ſo make it ſeem far more likely that he ſhould perſevere and be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than for any other Perſon in a ſingle capacity who would not be under the ſame engaging Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. So that it ſhould ſeem this way fixed, or put Mankind really upon a fairer foot for happineſs, than if each ſingle Perſon had been to have acted for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and to have made his own Choice.</p>
            <p>But then it is to be obſerved, that altho' both Adams acted in ſuch a publick capacity; yet there is a vaſt odds, a wide difference in the acts and influences them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which theſe two publick Perſons communicate to thoſe ſtanding in ſuch a Covenant relation with them.</p>
            <p>PROP. IV. <hi>For the one conveys Death with all the curſed influence of original Sin and Pollution: The other conveys Life with all the bleſſed fruits of Grace and bleſſings of Salvation to his Seed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt Adam by his firſt Sin, brought Guilt and Death on himſelf and all his Seed or Poſterity; the ſecond Adam, Chriſt, by his obedience and ſufferings purchaſed Life and Grace for his. This the Apoſtle aſſures us of in the Text; 'tis there taken for granted, that <hi>in Adam all die</hi>; which is a ſad Truth, in a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Senſe, viz. his firſt Sinful act which brought in the <hi>Fall</hi> was our act too, as acted by our publick Head, and ſo by us in and thro' him,; as alſo that ſinful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and corruption of Nature, which thereby he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to himſelf, he doth in the way of natural Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration communicate to us; in both which reſpects, we all ſinned in him, and are dead with him.</p>
            <p>When Adam put forth his Hand, and took and eat of the forbidden Fruit, he did this, not as a <hi>private</hi> but as a <hi>publick</hi> Perſon, as we have before ſhewn: Hence that his act was our act too, juſtly imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003871_0013_100207F4A7E6F740"/>
us, and charged on us, and put down to our Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe the act of our Head and Repreſentative, and by virtue thereof conveyed unto us. Thus we all died in Adam, he ſinning, we ſinned in him, he being condemned for it, we are condemned in and with him; hence that, Rom. 5 18 <hi>By the offence of one, Judgment is come on all Men to condemnation</hi> —</p>
            <p>Again, by this firſt Sin or Fall, our Father and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Head, Adam, not only loſt the Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs promiſed to perfect obedience, and incurr'd the Death threatned; but alſo he loſt that noble rectitude of Nature, that divine principle of Grace, and ſtock of Wiſdom, with which in his native ſtate of innocence he was furniſhed and indued; the moſt High taking of it from him, as a juſt puniſhment for that firſt and great Tranſgreſſion, for his great abuſe thereof; on which followed ignorance, pravity, and perverſneſs of Nature, corrupt and evil Principles, indiſpoſing the Mind for any good, and inclining of it to all manner of Evil.</p>
            <p>Now this pravity and corruption of Nature which is ſpiritual Death; according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. Adam com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to all his Seed, and that in the way of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generation. How and what this is, will more fully appear in the ſequel. But allowing the <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> the thing itſelf will appear conſiſtent with the rules of Juſtice. For we being guilty in the firſt great Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion by and with our Covenant Head, and that as ſoon as we have our being in him, by becoming of the ſpecies of Man; therefore the ſame puniſhment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came juſtly due to us, as to him, for the ſame Sin, at leaſt the ſame for kind.</p>
            <p>Now that puniſhment which immediately took place on him, for the firſt Sin, was God's caſting of him out of his favour, and taking from him thoſe noble divine habits, or principles of ſpiritual Wiſdom and Grace, with which he was dignifyed and endowed in his firſt Creation, called in holy writ the Image of God. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. And ſo leaving of him to fall under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003871_0014_100266EFCF49D950"/>
or governing influence of a corrupt and depraved mind.</p>
            <p>Well now! we being guilty in and with Adam of the ſame Tranſgreſſion, and that as ſoon as ever we become his Seed by having Soul and Body united together, it is but juſt that we ſhould for the ſame Sin be puniſhed in the ſame way Adam was, viz. by having that ſtock of Divine Wiſdom, Knowlege, and Grace (or what ever men will pleaſe to call it) withheld from and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us, in our Creation or Formation, which was due to our natures as firſt made in innocency, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to capacitate and furniſh us for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or yielding that perfect Obedience, which the Law required of us. On which depravation or withholding from us, will neceſſarily follow that pravity and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature of which we are ſpeaking. For Man hereby being left without divine Light, and ſo incapable to diſcern the ſpiritual &amp; real Excellencies of divine and heavenly things, being ſunk below the chief good, and ſo conſequently without inclination to it, hence the Soul can't chuſe and imbrace it; but being ſtill deſirous of good, and not rightly apprehending wherein it conſiſts, and how it may be attained unto; hence he betakes himſelf unto the World for happineſs, and would fain attain thereunto by gratifying the deſires of the Fleſh and carnal Mind, living in eaſe and pleaſure, apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no greater happineſs than he fancies may be enjoyed in this way, &amp;c.—which certainly is Death in a ſound Scripture ſenſe, Rom. 8.6. <hi>To be carnally minded is death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now of this original <hi>depravation</hi> or <hi>pravity</hi> of humane nature, I think this further account may be given, viz. Man in his innocent ſtate, was furniſh'd with powers <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural.</hi> By ſupernatural powers, I mean ſuch as capacitated him, clearly to diſcern the Will of God, and to entertain right notions about God, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, and myſteries, and perfectly to delight him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſame. Hereby he was made capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and of enjoying him as his chief good; perfectly to do his Duty, and to delight himſelf in it,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003871_0015_100207FA32227900"/>
and to live a life of communion with Heaven— <hi>this the Image of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His natural powers, I call ſuch as flowed from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſtitution, and capacitated him for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this World, and for taking complacency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as a ſubordinate good. And <hi>theſe</hi> were under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment &amp; regulation of his divine ſupernatural Powers. But when Man ſinned, God (in way of juſt puniſhment) took from him theſe ſupernatural Powers, or divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or habit, and left him wholly to his natural powers, which immediately aſſume the Government, and lead away the Man <hi>captive,</hi> &amp;c. Now this as I take it, is <hi>the natural Man,</hi> ſpoken of in 1 Cor. 2 14. <hi>But the natural man receives not the things of the ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, the Man being become thus depraved and carnal, wholly bent to carnal Pleaſures and enjoyments, conceiving his happineſs to conſiſt therein; <hi>hence</hi> he can't but have an inward averſion, to every thing that tends to thwart, croſs and ſtop him in the purſuit of that, wherein he hath conceived his felicity to conſiſt.</p>
            <p>Now the Word of God, and his authority therein, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this; <hi>hence</hi> he can't but dislike and hate it, at leaſt in his heart; as what he conceives would abridge him in his happineſs, by laying ſuch reſtraints on him, as he can't bear, and this inkindles enmity in him, againſt God and his holy Law: Which I take to be the <hi>Enmity</hi> ſpoken of, Rom. 8 7. <hi>Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that all Men <hi>dye in Adam,</hi> in this twofold ſenſe, viz. We are condemned in and with him, for the firſt ſin: and he communicates this pravity and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature, to all that deſcend from him, in the way of natural generation. And this ſeems to be the truth, evident both from reaſon &amp; Scripture; For Adam could communicate no other nature to his Children, than he had himſelf: well, his nature being now depraved and viciated, ſuch a nature therefore he muſt needs commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. And the Scriptures ſeem to give us this very account of the matter. Thus, after the Fall, Adam be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003871_0016_100266F151315E00"/>
a Son in his own <hi>likeneſs,</hi> Gen. 5.3— <hi>And begat a ſon in his own likeneſs, after his image.</hi>— And we are told what this is, John 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh</hi> And we are aſſured, that Children born of corrupt ſinful Parents, do derive from them no better a <hi>nature,</hi> Job 14.4 &amp; 15.14 <hi>What is Man that he ſhould be clean? And he which is born of a woman that he ſhould be righteous</hi>? And the Apoſtle confirms all this by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of us, what the ſpiritual condition of all perſons <hi>is,</hi> while in their natural eſtate, wholly corrupt, wholly gone out of the way, &amp;c. Rom. 3.10, 11, 12. <hi>As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one: There is none that underſtandeth, there is none that ſeeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one</hi> And ver. 13, 14, 16, 17.—<hi>Deſtruction &amp; miſery are in their ways: And the way of peace have they not known.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well now, Chriſt the ſecond Adam in like manner communicates a twofold life to all his ſpiritual <hi>Seed,</hi> viz. The life of Grace in Converſion, in this World, and a title to Eternal Life, in the other World.</p>
            <p>As the firſt Adam by the firſt ſin, brought all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny under a ſentence of Death; ſo Chriſt the ſecond Adam by his bearing the ſins of all the Elect, in his own Body on the Croſs, and being ſo made a curſe for them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 13. Hath hereby removed the Sentence of the Law, from all that are his, and purchaſed them a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from that Sentence; hence that, Rom 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is Chriſt that died.</hi> And alſo Chriſt by himſelf yielding, in our Natures, that very Obedience to the moral Law, which in the firſt Covenant, was made the condition of Eternal Life being beſtow'd; hath hereby given them a good and legal title unto life.</p>
            <p>The firſt Covenant threatned Death, on the leaſt failure in obedience, Gal. 3.10. <hi>It is written, Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Adam by the firſt Sin, made himſelf and all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Men of Death, the Law immediately pronounceth
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003871_0017_100266F3CBE2E090"/>
ſentence on them, Ezek. 18.4—<hi>The Soul that ſinneth it ſhall die.</hi> Hence Juſtice cannot be ſatisfied, nor the ſentence be reverſed, unleſs the blood of the offender be ſhed, the penalty truly ſuffered, Heb. 9.22. <hi>And without ſhedding of blood, is no remiſſion.</hi> Hence Chriſt the ſecond Adam, undertakes for this, dies in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuffers the full demands of Juſtice, as our Surety; which upon our believing, becomes ours, by the valid conſtitution of God; and in the Law looked upon as our own act, and ſuffering, as tho' ſuffered by us; becauſe done by our Surety and Repreſentative; which therefore takes us out of old Adam, in whom we ſinned; brings us from under the Law ſentence, and into good terms with <hi>it.</hi> Hence that Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>; compar'd with Rom. 3.19. and 6.14. <hi>Ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the reward of Life, was promis'd to <hi>perfect</hi> obedience, to the whole moral Law, as the Apoſtle plainly deſcribes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 5. But this Adam, and we in him, failed of, and ſo forfeited the reward; and have loſt all claim thereunto, as the Apoſtle teacheth us, Rom. 3 23. <hi>For all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> But Chriſt the ſecond Adam, hath alſo undertaken this for us, to renew our Claim, and in our Nature hath performed and yielded that very perfect obedience for us; hath fulfilled all righteouſneſs, as <hi>Matt</hi> 3 15.

            <p>Hereby hath he purchaſed for all that believe on him, the ſame title, and legal claim, to Eternal Life, that Adam would have had, and we in him, had he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſever'd in perfect obedience. Thus the ſecond Adam ſaves from the Death brought in by the <hi>firſt</hi>; not by any Relaxation of the ſeverity of the firſt Covenant, or Law, but by an exact and punctual fulfillment of the conditions of it, which ſeems to be the plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle in that, Rom 3. ult. <hi>Do we then make void the Law thro' Faith?

                  </gap>y,</hi> As Adam brought in by the Fall, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to all that deſcend from him, a fearful pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and corruption of Nature, which inclines all Men to ſtray &amp; wander from God endleſly; and every way diſpoſes and incapacitates them for a return; ſo that under the efficacy of this impotency, they are dying daily; as we have before ſhewn. So Chriſt the ſecond Adam, hath alſo a remedy for this evil diſeaſe, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers from this ſpiritual Miſery and Death. He hath purchaſed all Grace for his People, which by his holy Spirit, he conveys and communicates unto all, whom he effectually Calls to be <hi>his,</hi> to their recovery, and Renovation. He renews their ſpiritual powers, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants a principle of new Life, perſwades and enables them to return to God, and their duty; and makes them alive unto God, and holineſs. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. He revives again his own loſt Image in them; ſo making them new Creatures. 2 Cor. 5 17 <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature: old things are paſt away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all things are become new.</hi> He likewiſe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates unto them, all that influencing, aſſiſting, &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grace, whereby his ſpiritual Seed, &amp; Children, are enabled to overcome the World, vanquiſh Temptation, mortify their Luſts, and to perſevere in an holy Life; to the final Salvation of their Souls. Hence that Joh. 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſs have we all received, and grace for grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have ſhewn what both Adams <hi>convey,</hi> &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to their Seed.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to the fifth and laſt thing, viz</p>
            <p>PROP. V. <hi>That each of theſe convey; or each of theſe communications are made much in the ſame way and manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the text intimates to us; As in Adam — So in Chriſt —</p>
            <p>Three things conſider'd will clear up this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Each of theſe communications are made in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant way</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Each of theſe are in purſuance of the Covenant made with each publick head. The firſt Adam being Head

of the firſt or old Covenant, doth therefore <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the guilt &amp; curſes of that broken Covena<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> unto all wrap'd up with him therein; becauſe ſuch was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> tenour of that Covenant; that his acts and doings as ſuch a publick Perſon, ſhould be equally their act, for whom he ſo acted: and that his influence ſhould derive to them as above ſhewn.</p>
            <p>So in like manner, that Chriſt's Suffering, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is made ours in Law, and imputed; and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his Grace conveyed, is in purſuance of the ſecond or new Covenant. Hence</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As Adam conveys ſin and guilt to thoſe that had not ſinned actually; So doth Jeſus Chriſt convey righteouſneſs to thoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that had not wrought righteouſneſs.</hi> Adam act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us in the Covenant, and we in him; hence upon his firſt ſinful act, we were all virtually made ſinners; and ſo the ſentence went out againſt us; and we were hereby involved in the Curſe, were looked upon as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, &amp; expoſed to the condemning ſentence of the Law; and this before we made our ſelves ſo, by any perſonal, ſinful act of our own. Hence that Rom. 5 14. <hi>Death reigned from Adam to Moſes, even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion.</hi> Now to ſin actually, is to ſin after the ſimilitude of Adam's tranſgreſſion, but before we ſin ſo, ſaith the Apoſtle, Death reigns over us. The Apoſtle in this, as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, doubtleſs points at Babes, who die in Infancy, before ever they had committed an actual ſin; yet Death reigns over them, they are guilty in their federal head.</p>
            <p>So Chriſt's righteouſneſs in like manner, is conveyed to thoſe that had not wrought righteouſneſs. Yea all the Elect are choſen, and in the Decree or Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption looked upon as Righteous, having a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs engaged for, ſecured and laid up for them in the Covenant, long before there is any real conveyance thereof made to them, yea long before they have their being or exiſtence in the World; as ſeems evident from the Eph. 1 4, 5. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003871_0020_100207FF042E9268"/>
and without blame before him in love: Having predeſtinated us unto the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will</hi> compare Rom. 9 <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0, 31 <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? That the Gentiles which followed not after righteouſneſs, have attained to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>—.And it was by virtue of this Obedience &amp; Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, though not actually wrought out, yet engaged for, and ſecured in Covenant to all the Elect, to be conveyed unto them upon their believing, — that all the holy Men of old were ſav'd; as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Finally,</hi> It is in the ſame way and manner, even thro' our union to either of theſe publick Heads, that either of theſe communications are actually made, and conveyed to us. No ſooner do we become of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Mankind, by having Soul and Body united, but hereby we become united unto Adam, of his Seed and Children; by virtue of which union to him, his Sin is imputed and his Guilt conveyed unto us perſonally, together with that whole depravation, pravity, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Nature which Adam procured, and brought in by his firſt Sin or Fall. What leſs than this is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that ingenious and plump confeſſion of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did my Mother conceive me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this corrupt and ſinful Nature thus derived, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers its ſelf in Children as ſoon as they can act, which is indeed an inconteſtable proof of the truth here in hand: Hence that Pſal. 58.3. <hi>The wicked are eſtranged from the womb, they go aſtray as ſoon as they be born ſpeaking lies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well now in like manner; as ſoon as a Soul is united to Chriſt the ſecond Adam, through Faith in his Name, what he hath done becomes that Souls, his merits are applied and his righteouſneſs is conveyed, and made over to it, and is in Covenant, and Law looked upon as his own: and that Perſon ſtands righteous and clear before God in the virtue of the ſame; hence ſuch Texts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22 <hi>Eph.</hi> 2 61.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:003871_0021_100266FA41B8C008"/>Thro' this union alſo is conveyed all needed influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Grace. No ſooner are we thro' Faith, cut out of the old and curſed Stock in which we grew, and ingraffed into the true Olive; but hereupon are we made to partake of the juice and fatneſs, or ſap of this Olive; whereby we have our natures changed from ſinful to holy Diſpoſitions, and are prepared to bare and bring forth good Fruit, as branches abiding in the true Vine, as Joh. 15 4, 5.</p>
            <p>Thus we have endeavour'd to ſhew what is contained, and wrapt up in theſe few Words. <hi>As in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>Application</hi> or <hi>Improvement</hi> now follows</p>
            <p>USE I. Of <hi>Information</hi> in a few things, As</p>
            <p n="1">1. Learn we from what was offer'd under the Doctrine, <hi>That Adam and Jeſus Chriſt divide the World.</hi> They are both covenant Heads, and the alone publick Heads, to whom all Perſons in the World ſtand related in Covenant. All in their natural Eſtate are the Children and covenant Seed of Adam, have their in-being in him, and ſo are under the Curſe he brought in; and alſo under the Government and influence of a depraved vitiated Nature derived from him, and muſt ſo remain until by Faith in Chriſt the ſecond Adam, they get out out of this curſed Stock by being ingraffed into the new and living one. This is a ſad ſtate and condition, not only of all Heathens, Pagans, Infidels, &amp;c. but alſo of all unbelieving, prophane, hypocritical, chriſtian Profeſſors: They are ſtill the Children of old Adam and fallen with him, involved, <hi>deeply involved</hi> with him in <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Miſery,</hi> expoſed to periſh for ever.</p>
            <p>But now all believers, all faithful Chriſtians, they belong to the other publick Head, even Chriſt the ſecond Adam; they are no longer related to the firſt Adam, no more under the dominion of the Law of the firſt Covenant, Chriſt hath fulfilled that Law for them, born the penalty, yielded the obedience therein required, and ſo hath diſcharged them from the demands and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003871_0022_100266FBCEFEF188"/>
penalties of it, ſtoped its mouth, <hi>that it hath nothing to lay to the Charge of theſe Elect of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhews us the wide difference there is between us, who make profeſſion of the ſame Faith, embrace the ſame way of Worſhip, dwell together and Worſhip together, in the ſame Family, ſame Congregation, and ſame viſible Church, there are ſome who are the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the firſt Adam, involved in the Curſe, laden with Guilt, receive of his curſed influence, and are really heirs of Hell and wrath. Others belong to Chriſt, are his happy Seed and bleſſed Children, heirs of the Covenant of Grace and thro' him of Glory; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of his bleſſed influence; <hi>of his fulneſs and grace for grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! the difference between the Children of Chriſt, and the Children of fallen Adam, tho' we diſcern it not with a carnal Eye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence learn alſo, from what hath been inſiſted on; <hi>That there is no mid-way between a ſtate of Nature, and a ſtate of Grace: Or between an eſtate of real Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and real Condemnation.</hi> There is no medium, no mid-way between theſe two. Every Perſon in the World, is in an eſtate either of compleat Juſtification, or of real Condemnation; there is no being, or ſtanding in mid-way between theſe two. Converſion is inſtantaneous; the Man paſſeth immediately out of the one condition, into the other. There are degrees of Sanctification, but none of Juſtification. No Man is partly in an eſtate of Juſtification, &amp; partly in an eſtate of Condemnation; nor is one Saint more fully juſtified than another. He that hath any title to Heaven, hath all the title that can be; <hi>Chriſt's Righteouſneſs is equally unto and upon all who believe, without any the leaſt difference</hi>; and he that hath not this full title, hath none at all. He that an't fully in Chriſt, is fully in Adam, &amp;c. Alas there are many who can't conclude themſelves Converts, have no good evidence or warrant ſo to do; yea who dare not really pretend to do it: Who yet labour to bear themſelves up, upon a hope, that their honeſt mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, moral lives, duties, alms-giving, &amp;c. will ſo make
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003871_0023_10020800A0EECD28"/>
even for their Sins, and be of that worth in the ſight of God, as to procure for them acceptance: They fancy they live as well as moſt Chriſtians do, they don't wrong their Neighbours in their dealings, they are no Fornicators, no Idolators, they defraud nor, they go the rounds in Duties, make many Prayers; and they think ſurely there is real worth in all this; and why an't they as likely to find acceptance as any; they can't think that a God of mercy, will ſend ſuch as they are to Hell, tho' they do fall ſhort of a thorough Converſion, tho' they an't really in Chriſt thro' a divine Faith.</p>
            <p>But Sirs, if what we have heard on this Subject be true, your hopes, ſuch hopes, are utterly vain and groundleſs; for it is certain you belong to the one, or the other of theſe publick Heads; if you are not in Chriſt by a thorough work of the Spirit, by a true and ſound Converſion, you are yet in old Adam; and if in him, you are certainly under the Curſe, and can have no acceptance with God: And you ſhould hearken to what the Scripture ſaith Joh. 3.18— <hi>But he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not is condemned already.</hi> &amp; ver. 36. <hi>He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the Son, hath everlaſting life: and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not on the Son, ſhall not ſee life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> And that is an awful Text, Rev. 21.8. <hi>The fearful, and unbelieving, &amp;c. ſhall have their part in the Lake that burns with Fire &amp; Brimſtone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I paſs on,</p>
            <p n="3">3. From what has been offered we may gather ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>To teach us the woful eſtate of Adam's Children.</hi> They die ſaith the Apoſtle in the Text; they are in a fearful deadly Condition; they are fallen in Adam, the Law hath paſſed Sentence of Death on them, which Sentence unleſs they get reverſed, get removed from off them, it is impoſſible they ſhould eſcape Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But this they can never do by their utmoſt pains and diligence, while they remain in their preſent eſtate of unbelief and impenitency; for the Law they are under, curſeth them, <hi>even</hi> while they ſtrive to keep it, becauſe they fall ſhort of perfect obedience. Hear that Gal. 3.10. <hi>For as many as are of the works of the

And tho' there is a moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious way of eſcape provided, yet how indiſpoſed, and averſe are they to a compliance therewith, they are full of enmity againſt it, at leaſt in their Hearts, Rom. 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity.</hi>—And no wonder! ſince they are ſo full of ſpiritual blindneſs, as not to be able to ſee, either their own Miſery, or Chriſt's Excellency.</p>
            <p>Hence being deſtitute of Divine, and Spiritual Light, and incapable to diſcern the Excellencies of God and Chriſt &amp; Holineſs,'tis no wonder that they cannot love God and Holineſs, and hate Sin; without which the will never can convert, nor the Man have any true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be brought out of his preſent ſinful condition.</p>
            <p>Indeed in their preſent ſtate of blindneſs, they may have ſome notions, and rational Convictions, that their preſent condition an't ſafe; and ſo may be endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recover themſelves by their own doings; &amp; hence many times take pains, and go a great way in moral Vertues and Duties, yet ſtill they have no inward cordial love for Religion and Holineſs, 'tis always a burden, and meer vexation to them, and they won't be perſwaded, to caſt off their own vain confidences, and to ſee that all they can do won't help, nor avail them, until they do indeed lay aſide their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and look out after Faith in Chriſt, and an intereſt in him, who only can help and ſave them, out of their ſpiritual Miſery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003871_0025_10020805791D8948"/>This while they neglect, what ever pains they may take, to be their own ſaviour's, yet are they but run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themſelves deeper in debt, &amp; getting further from true peace and ſafety.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Our Doctrine alſo teacheth us, ſomething <hi>of the happy eſtate of Chriſt's ſpiritual</hi> Seed. The Text tells us, that <hi>in Chriſt they are all made alive:</hi> Tho' they were once dead in Adam, yet now in Chriſt they are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, &amp; live evermore. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt delivers all <hi>his</hi> from the death &amp; miſery brought in by Adam, and gives them the ſame, or a better title to life, than Adam would have had, if he had perfectly kept the Law, and performed the obedience therein required.</p>
            <p>From ſpiritual Death, or the reigning Power of Sin, he delivers them, by ſending his holy Spirit into their Hearts, to dethrone Sin there; — ſoften the Heart, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the Mind, perſwade the Will, put a new Bias on the Affections, &amp;c. whereby the Temper, Diſpoſition, and Inclination, of the Mind is alter'd, from ſinful to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Sin and Luſt loſeth the Dominion, and Grace takes the Throne of the Heart, ſits and rules there; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' Corruption riſe, and ſtir around the Heart, and give Trouble, yet it cannot get the Dominion, Grace keeps it down and ſubdues it again Hence that, Rom 6.14. <hi>For Sin ſhall not have Dominion over you</hi> — compare with Pſal. 37 24 <hi>Tho' he fall, he ſhall nor be utterly caſt down: for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand</hi> From the curſe and condemnation of the Law, hath he redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by being made a curſe for them, and ſo bearing the penalty in their room and ſtead, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. A title unto life hath he purchaſed for them, by yielding in our natures as our publick head, that very obedience to the Law of the firſt Covenant, which was required of Man in innocency, as the condition of Lifes being continued, and perfect happineſs being beſtowed, which condition Chriſt having fulfilled, muſt needs now give the ſame title and claim to happineſs.</p>
            <p>And as obedience to the new Covenant, is required in order to our partaking in the ſaving benefits thereof, ſo Chriſt hath purchaſed, and by his good Spirit conveys all

            </p>
            <p>If it be as we have heard, then ſurely it concerns us all to <hi>Examine</hi> our ſelves, that we may know to which of theſe Covenant Heads we belong, in which Adam we are; It is certain we every one of us belong to the <hi>one</hi> or to the <hi>other,</hi> and according as we ſtand related, ſo is our eſtate good or bad, ſafe or dangerous: Then let us be adviſed to examine into this matter, and try our ſelves, that ſo we may know how it is like to fare with is; 'tis a matter of the laſt moment, therefore take heed of careleſneſs herein; don't be flighty, don't deceive yourſelves; remember 'tis the precious Soul that lieth at ſtake, that is to be ſav'd or loſt, and your end will be as your ſpiritual relation is at laſt found to be, either to the firſt, or to the ſecond Adam. In the one <hi>all die,</hi> in the other <hi>all are made alive.</hi> And for your help here, I will lay down two or three rules of tryal;</p>
            <p n="1">1. What Birth have you? Only the natural! are you only Born, or are you alſo New-born? For they who deſcend from Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the way of natural Generation, are his Seed, and belong to him, as you heard under the Doctrine. But, they that are Born again of ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, are the Seed of the ſecond Adam.

And hath this put you upon an humble, fervent, &amp; dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent looking and ſeeking unto Chriſt, to ſend his holy Spirit to enlighten, help and ſave you? In a word, hath the Law ſlain you, and the Goſpel heal'd you? have you been indeed dead in Adam, but reviv'd and made alive in Chriſt? How do you live, is it in newneſs of life, as becomes ſuch a New-born ſtate?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which Covenant doth your Souls cleave unto, and act under the influence of, that of Works or of Grace?</p>
            <p>Adam is head of the Covenant of Works, but Jeſus Chriſt of the Covenant of Grace. Well then, would you know to which you belong, in which <hi>Adam</hi> you have your in-being; Examine to which Covenant doth your Souls cleave, to that of Works or of Grace? And would you know this; then reflect and ask your ſelves, on what ſcore do you perform Duties, is it to ingratiate your ſelves into God's favour by your own doings, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, &amp; duties? why this is to cleave to the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works. So on what account do you look for, and expect acceptance in Duties &amp; Obedience, is it on account of any worth in them, or in you? why this is an old Covenant Spirit. So do you go forth in your own ſtrength unto Duty? this is to cleave to the old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and will argue you belong to old Adam.</p>
            <p>But now to go out of ſelf, to have no confidence in the fleſh, to depend on the meer Grace of God in Chriſt, to look unto and be as dependant on the holy Spirit for aſſiſtance, diſpoſition, and ability, to perform duties, as on Chriſt the Son to merit acceptance for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be thus dependent on meer free Grace for every thing; for aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in all your Obedience, and on Chriſt's merits and interceſſions alone, for your whole acceptance therein: <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
