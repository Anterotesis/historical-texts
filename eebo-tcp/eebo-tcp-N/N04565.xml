         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A brief and ſorrowful Account of the preſent State of the Churches in NEW-ENGLAND.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Beauty and Strength of a Community (eſpecially Eccleſiaſtical) conſiſts in nothing more, than in the Harmony of it's Members. This has been the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing Glory of the <hi>New-England</hi> Churches in general, from the Days of our Fore-fathers, who, under GOD, planted the Goſpel at the Peril of their Lives, in this <hi>American</hi> Wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>But now, alas too ſoon! Strife and Contention is come upon us like a Flood, which threatens the overthrow of all Order, and the utter ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Goſpel Conſtitution. This gives us Occaſion to take up the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation as of old and ſay, <hi>How is the Gold become dim, and the fine Gold changed? How hath the Lord covered the Daughter of Zion with a Cloud in his Anger, and caſt down from Heaven to the Earth the Beauty of Iſrael? The Crown is fallen from our Head, wo to us that we have ſinned!</hi> But is our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition now indeed ſuch, that there are none of the Sons which we have brought up, found worthy to lead us by the Hand and give Conduct to theſe Churches in this gloomy Day? Or ſhall we reſign them up to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and ſet <hi>them</hi> at the Head of the Miniſtry and our religious Affairs? Shall we imitate the Jewiſh Church in her Times of Degeneracy, and abundantly repleniſh our ſelves from the Eaſt and other Quarters (tho' not with profeſs'd Soothſayers, yet) with enthuſiaſtick and erroneous Itinerant Preachers, and Tribes of publick Exhorters? It is an Error eaſily imbib'd and practis'd upon, for Perſons to value themſelves and others on Account of ſudden Impreſſions and Impulſes on the Mind, placing theſe in the room of the immediate Dictates and Influences of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> tho' they have no Foundation in the Word of God to ſupport them; but are the Effect of their own over-heated Imaginations, and vain Conceit of their ſuperiour
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005667_0003_1026B9B1DD844A28"/>Attainments in Knowledge and Experience of the Spirit's Operation. And this ſelf exalting Opinion leads Men to cenſure and condemn thoſe as carnal and unconverted, who don't gratify their Ambition, and give them the Pre eminence above all that are not in their Way of thinking, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever otherwiſe diſtinguiſh'd in Station, Piety and Accompliſhments. How applicable to ſuch Men is the Parable, which our Saviour ſpake <hi>concerning thoſe who truſted in themſelves that they were Righteous, and deſpis'd others?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how lamentable are the Wounds and bitter Effects which this Spirit has already produc'd among Us! And what a formidable Appearance of ſtill greater Miſery! Whilſt Party is engag'd againſt Party, Miniſters againſt Miniſters, Churches againſt Churches; open Violations of ſolemn Church-Covenants are become common, and , with ſome, commendable; Church-Members cenſuring, judging and walking with Slanders againſt one another; Party Councils are call'd to oppoſe each other, according to the different Denominations and Sentiments of the Parties inviting them: There have been ſome Inſtances in theſe Times of Husbands who have forſaken their own lawful Wives, with whom they have liv'd in Love and Peace, alledging that ſuch indeed are their carnal Wives, but as they think them unconverted, they reject them, ſuppoſing it to be warrantable and expedient to frequent the Company of other Women of the like pretended extraordinary Illumination.</p>
            <p>Thus Communion of Churches is in a great degree loſt, the beautiful Harmony of Miniſters, as Fellow-helpers in their Work, turn'd too much into party Views and Strangeneſs one towards another; the religious Order of Families turn'd out of Doors, the Honour and Duty of Children to Parents, Servants to Maſters is neglected, and Reverence due to the Aged and Honourable is caſt behind our Backs. <hi>For theſe Things fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and trembling is come upon us; the Ways of Zion do mourn, her Prieſts ſigh, her Virgins are afflicted and ſhe is in bitterneſs, for her Beauty is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, and Shame hath covered her Face.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis eaſy to point out the Troublers of our Peace and former happy Union. Every Man that will judge impartially and free from deſign, knows that the Rev. Meſſirs. <hi>Whitefield, Tennant, Davenport,</hi> and other Itinerants, with the many Exhorters under their Influence, have thrown us into this Convulſion and heat of Contention. Which plainly appears, in the firſt Place, from Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Conduct.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as this Gentleman mounted the Stage here, he liberally threw out his Cenſures upon the Miniſters, Colleges and Churches. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality <hi>of the Miniſters preaching an unknown, unfelt Chriſt; that they were dead Men, which was the Reaſon of the deadneſs of their Congregations in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005667_0004_1026B9B460078620"/>Matters of Religion.</hi> vid. <hi>N. E.</hi> Journ. p. 70, 71. Thus aſſuming to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf GOD's Prerogative, who claims it as his peculiar to know the Heart. The Diſciples of CHRIST, tho' converſant with <hi>Judas</hi> the whole Term of our Saviour's publick Miniſtry on Earth, did not know <hi>Judas</hi> to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Man and a Traytor, 'till he diſcovered it; but were all ready to ſuſpect themſelves rather than him: They received <hi>Simon Magus</hi> into their Number as a true Believer, till he offer'd Money to purchaſe the Gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now can it be ſuppos'd on any rational Grounds that Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> or any others of like Pretences at this Day, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with greater Gifts of the Spirit, ſo as to be able to know what others feel of the Spirit of <hi>CHRIST</hi> in their Souls, and venture to publiſh it to the World, as Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> has done? This is the Man that brought this Spirit of pretended Penetration into this Land. And with what an amazing Spread has it gained Proſelytes in every Quarter? Some of whom pretend to determine the State of every Perſon they meet at firſt Sight: Others more cautious judge by comparing Experiences, ſtill making their own Experiences the Standard by which others muſt be tried. This Officiouſneſs of Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> we have paid dear for, but what it may yet coſt us none can foreſee.</p>
            <p>What can we think this Gentleman means? Would he have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that in this he acted the Part of a Miniſter of CHRIST, or a Chriſtian? Was it from the Dictates and Direction of the Spirit of GOD he ſpake thus? <hi>That</hi> could not be, for the Spirit of Truth can't contradict it ſelf; and the Spirit expreſly tells us that <hi>him that ſoweth Diſcord among Brethren, God hates,</hi> Prov. 6.19. And we are ſtrictly forbidden <hi>to receive an Accuſation, againſt an Elder, but before two or three Witneſſes,</hi> 1 Tim 5.19. If we are <hi>not to take up</hi> an Accuſation againſt a Miniſter, but with a Proviſo, much leſs may we <hi>publiſh</hi> it. Was it poſſible for Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> to produce authentick Vouchers to ſupport his Charges againſt our Miniſters, Colleges and Churches? No, verily. Nay, if all the invidious and diſaffected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the Land, had come from all Parts with their united Complaints againſt their Miniſters, yet it was impoſſible for him (a perfect Stranger in the Country, and but a little while with us) to form an adequate Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the State of Perſons and Things, ſo as to juſtify the Accuſations he has brought againſt them. Will Scripture, Reaſon or civil Juſtice countenance ſuch Conduct in <hi>any Man</hi> however otherwiſe fam'd? Does not this Gentleman arrogate to himſelf a ſuper-intendancy, the Authority of Dictator-general, and a Power ſo abſolute that <hi>whom he will be ſets up, and whom he will be pulls down.</hi> What an unbecoming Slight does he
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005667_0005_1026B9B5E88FC618"/>put on the Miniſters in general, however deſerving, except ſome few who are in a ſort canonized in his Journal? But his Authority in this and his Itinerancy (as by him manag'd) we deny, becauſe not commanded: For what is not appointed in the Word of GOD, in Matter, of Religion and Order, is a Degree of Idolatry, and forbidden in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
            <p>Did Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> intend thus to <hi>ſmite the Shepherds, that the Sheep might be ſcattered?</hi> If ſo, he may behold with Satisfaction (if any can be had in it) that his Deſigns are wonderfully ſucceeded in the preſent ſcattered State of our Churches, from the Prejudices which he has inſtilled into the Minds of many againſt their own Paſtors and Brethren.</p>
            <p>Moreover, This Gentleman's Conduct is the more exceptionable, for that many of thoſe Miniſters whom he has ſo liberally loaded with Infamy and Contempt, are Gentlemen whoſe Characters have been eſtabliſhed in the Conſciences of all that knew them, for their Soundneſs in the Faith, and good Example of Life, and that for more Years than he has liv'd in the World, their Enemies themſelves being Judges, 'till he had prejudic'd their Minds by his evil Inſinuations. Yet theſe good Men are now loaded with manifold Calumny, under which they go heavily and hardly beſtead, in an advanced Age, <hi>becauſe Reproach has broken their Bones;</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches not of Strangers only, but their Brethren in the Miniſtry, and in their Communion alſo: And now they have but little proſpect of healing, and expect to live in a great Meaſure uſeleſs, and then go to their Graves with the bleeding Wounds of this Gentleman's cenſorious Pen, and the Reproaches of Exhorters and others which have fallen upon them.</p>
            <p>What an aſſuming Temper does Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> alſo ſhew in condemning our College? vid. Journ. p. 96. When he ſays, <hi>"their Light is become Darkneſs, Darkneſs that may be felt."</hi> This is a ſad Reproach upon a Society which GOD has remarkably ſmil'd on, and made a rich Bleſſing; from whence has iſſued a Succeſſion of able and faithful Miniſters, for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of theſe Churches for a Century of Years, without Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Aſſiſtance: But we truſt GOD will appear in the Behalf of our Colleges, and wipe off the Aſperſions caſt upon them, and ſtill continue them rich Seminaries of Piety and Learning. What can be the Deſign of this Gentleman in publiſhing ſuch Repreſentations of our Colleges, unleſs it be to induce us to content ourſelves with illiterate and enthuſiaſtick Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whom he or his Friends have ſet up, 'till we can be ſupplied from <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, the Orphan-Houſe in Georgia,</hi> or <hi>the Shepherd's Tent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:005667_0006_1026B9B7B75B91E0"/>
But as preſſing Repreſentations and juſt Complaints have been publiſhed on theſe Heads, by the Governours of our Colleges, united Aſſociations of Miniſters, and ſeveral of our Rev. and aged Fathers ſeparately: I ſhall only Remark at preſent, that it is the Opinion of many, that ſince Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> has not manifeſted his Repentance for the Offences he ſtands charged with, tho' call'd to it from all Quarters, he therefore ſtands indited, <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ro Eccleſiae,</hi> and in the Memory and juſt Reſentment of all that act up to the Rules of Goſpel-Diſcipline, for raſh Judging and Slander. They think he has been guilty of a Breach of the ninth Commandment, or in other Words, <hi>has born falſe Witneſs</hi> (as is ſometimes ſaid) <hi>with a witneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then as tho' Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had not ſufficiently broken our Churches, we were ſoon viſited by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennent;</hi> who was ſent by him, and redoubled his Aſperſions on the Miniſtry; yet not with ſo much Openeſs in theſe Parts, as he has done in his <hi>Nottingham</hi> Sermon, wherein he declares <hi>the Body of the Clergy of this Generation to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted.</hi> And that he might the more effectually promote Diviſions among us, did, in his publick Exerciſes at <hi>Boſton,</hi> thank GOD for the Diviſions which began to appear there, and pray'd they might be increas'd as an hopeful Omen of an happy Reformation. As if the People were <hi>Barbarians</hi> or <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and needed now by him to be taught the firſt Principles of the Oracles of GOD. That he was of ſuch a diviſive Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, his Sermon on unconverted Miniſters is a ſufficient Proof. His Words are theſe, <hi>Pag.</hi> 12, 13, <q>GOD's People have a Right to all GOD's Miniſters; why mayn't they uſe them as they have Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? And if they ſhould go a few Miles further than ordinary to enjoy thoſe they Profit moſt by, whom do they wrong?</q> This was a Leſſon of Indulgence ſo pleaſing to the Diſaffected, that they ſoon put it in Practice, and thereupon ſeparated themſelves from their Paſtors and Brethren in greater Numbers than before, perſiſting in it as laudable and a Duty from this Act of Toleration and Advice.</p>
            <p>He then draws a Compariſon from the leſs to the greater, <hi>viz.</hi> From the irrational Creatures, the Beaſts, Birds and Fiſhes, which are led by an inſtinct in Nature, to ſeek the Food which they like beſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A weak Way of arguing indeed! (however plauſible it may appear to ſome) to make Men as diſorderly and voracious as the wild Beaſts of the Earth and Fiſhes of the Sea, who bite and prey upon one another. This indeed is too much our Manner at preſent, and is encouraged by many who take Sanctuary under the Sentiments of thoſe Gentlemen I have mention'd and others of the like diviſive Spirit.</p>

The Rev Mr. <hi>James Davenport,</hi> in Succeſſion, made a Viſit alſo to theſe Parts of the Country, deem'd to be a Man full of the Spirit, as indeed he was of the like cenſorious, judging and uncharitable Spirit: But he did not care to take Things meerly upon truſt and evil Suſpicion, as others had done before him; and therefore proceeded to a formal Examination into the Experiences of Miniſters, in order to form a right Judgment of their State, and whether they preach'd an unknown unfelt CHRIST, or not. But becauſe of this and other ſuch like Steps, and being apprehended to be under a deep Tincture of Enthuſiaſm, he had not Admiſſion into the Gentlemen's Pulpits at <hi>Boſton,</hi> which 'tis probable he and others expected. And 'tis thought by many that if there had been the like Caution with Reſpect to the former Gentlemen, the Proſpect of Peace in our Churches would have been more hopeful than now it is like to be. When Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> firſt came among us the Expectations of many were rais'd to an high Degree; but by reaſon of his enthuſiaſtick Conduct here, and his burning the Books at <hi>New-London,</hi> and his partial Retractations, moſt of his Admirers have chang'd their Minds, and call him delirious, or an Apoſtate, or both.</p>
            <p>If theſe Gentlemen had ſupported their Conduct by divine Revelation, it would not have been wonder'd at, that they had ſo many Admirers: But as they bring no ſtronger Teſtimony than their own bare Word, and the Meaſures which they have taken are ſo contrary to the known Rules of the Goſpel,—we ſay, — <hi>Let God be true, but every Man a Liar. To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no light in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as theſe two Gentlemen Meſſirs. <hi>Tennent</hi> and <hi>Davenport</hi> have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſome Retractations on theſe Heads, I ſhall leave them at preſent, more ſeriouſly and penitently to reflect on the Hurt they have done to Religion, the Miniſtry and the Order of our Churches, wiſhing that they and all other Itinerants and publick Exhorters which they have dextrouſly promoted may be prevailed with to be equally ſollicitous, to reſtore our Peace as they have been inſtrumental to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>We have alſo had the the Rev. Meſſirs. <hi>Croſswell, Wheelock, Parſons, Bus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To return to Mr. <hi>Whitefield.</hi> He is now making a ſecond Viſit to us, in pompous Progreſs from Town to Town follow'd with the loud Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of many People, while ſome, from whom more manly Things
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005667_0008_1026B9BF1CD79B20"/>might be expected, ſeem to lay their Necks at his Feet to trample on at Pleaſure, as if his Word was not only <hi>his own</hi> but <hi>their</hi> Law alſo,—accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that—<hi>Stat pro ratione Voluntas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe this Gentleman would be thought to act in the Capacity of an <hi>Evangeliſt;</hi> but I think his Methods no ways anſwer this Character; for according to the generally receiv'd Notion, he muſt then Preach chiefly where Miniſters are not ſettled, and the pure Goſpel and the Ordinances thereof eſtabliſh'd, which is the unhappy Caſe of ſome Towns in this and the neighbouring Government: Whereas he ſhuns theſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Since the Writing of this Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> has taken a Tour into ſome of the Towns which are without ſettled Miniſters, and the Ordinances of the Goſpel.</note>, and preaches chiefly in our great Towns where there are ſettled Miniſters, as able and perhaps more ſo than himſelf; and ſo inſtead of healing our Diviſions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes them, as is the evident Effect in moſt of the Towns where he has preach'd both now and when he was here before.—What Conſtructions can be put on theſe Things, but either that he acts too much on Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s Principle, <hi>viz.</hi> The more we are divided, ſo much the more hopeful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the revival of Religion; or elſe that he retains his declar'd Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Miniſters in general, that they are dead Men, &amp;c. —And agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> that it is as dangerous to the Souls of Men to hear ſuch Miniſters preach as a Potion of Ratsbane would be to their Bodies; perhaps Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> tarries among us to deliver our People from this mortal Poiſon.</p>
            <p>But whatever may be the Deſigns of this Gentlemen, I think the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Condition of our Churches calls upon all <hi>that love Zion and pray for her Peace and Proſperity, to conſider, take Advice, and ſpeak their Minds.</hi> I am thus free to offer my Opinion, under affecting Apprehenſions of the Evils come and coming on our Conſtitution. And as I have no Deſign to offend any Perſon, but only deſire that Things may be <hi>weigh'd in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the Sanctuary,</hi> and that our loſt Love and Unity and Order may be reſtor'd, therefore crave Leave, to offer the following Queries to the Publick, and eſpecially to thoſe Reverend Miniſters who have given Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> ſuch free Admiſſion into their Pulpits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 1. Whether there is not at leaſt an Appearance of Inconſiſtency in thoſe Gentlemen's Conduct who had ſubſcrib'd in their publick Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny againſt Itinerant Preachers? Unleſs the Proviſo of <hi>Subſtance, Scope and End,</hi> annex'd to ſome of their Names was deſign'd to preſerve a Liberty in that Caſe to act as Occaſion might call for: Or muſt the Subſcription be

            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 2. Whether theſe Gentlemen have exerciſed due Love and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Regard to their Brethren in the Miniſtry, in inviting Mr <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> to preach when they might at the firſt Glance foreſee, that it had a direct Tendency to revive Suſpicions in the Minds of their diſaffected Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to open the Wound which was then under hopeful Symptoms of Healing?—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 3. Whether theſe Gentlemen have diſcover'd a juſt Regard to our Colleges, which have ſo long been the Glory and Strength of our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Eccleſiaſtical Polity? Have they been fir'd with a becoming Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment at theſe Aſperſions caſt upon theſe Societies, by that Gentleman whom they ſo much careſs? Where is the Honour and Gratitude due to their venerable Mother in whoſe Boſom, theſe very Gentlemen have been nouriſhed and tenderly brought up, and to whom under GOD they owe their Academical Acquirements and publick uſeful Improvements?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 4. Whether it has not a manifeſt Tendency to weaken our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, if not deſtroy the Order and Diſcipline of theſe Churches, for publick Offenders to be admitted to Communion, or ſpecial publick Acts of Religion, ſuch as Preaching and Adminiſtring the Sacraments, until they evidence true Repentance and give Satisfaction to the Party offended, as the Goſpel requires?

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005667_0010_1026B9C283B50538"/>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 6. Can it be rationally ſuppos'd, that a Goſpel Reformation and Revival of Religion, muſt be built upon Separations and Contentions as many now pretend? drawing it as an Inference from CHRIST'S ſaying <hi>I came not to ſend Peace but a Sword,</hi> Mat. 10.34. As tho' CHRIST had conſtituted his own Members for whom he died, to be the common Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners one of another; which muſt lead directly to the Deſolation of his Church and Kingdom, as he proves Ch. 12.25. <hi>Every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf is brought to Deſolation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> 7. Is it not highly probable, that the <hi>Moravians,</hi> a People wild in their Principles, and big with Euthuſiaſm and vain Glory, ſhould make a Deſcent upon us in their Turn, when they hear what ſucceſs this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman has had in working over ſo many into his own Way of thinking and to ſuch an Admiration of his Perſon? eſpecially when they have ſuch Numbers of their Brethren the Exhorters actually engag'd in their Cauſe; and many others under rais'd Apprehenſions of their own ſuperiour Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, already ſettled among us; waiting the firſt Opportunity to exerciſe their Gifts, ſo pleaſing to the People, and in their Apprehenſions vaſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding their own Miniſters, by whom they think themſelves unreaſonably reſtrain'd.—</p>
            <p>Theſe Queries I ſubmit to the ſerious Peruſal and Conſideration of all my Brethren in the Miniſtry, eſpecially thoſe whom they do more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concern.</p>
            <p>But if theſe Reverend Gentlemen can not only free themſelves from Inconſiſtency, but alſo anſwer all the other Objections contained in theſe Queries, yet one would think, that only the Sight of Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Life and Journals muſt have made <hi>Them,</hi> as well as all others, very cautious of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting into their Pulplts, a Gentleman of ſuch a Temper and caſt of Mind as he appears to be.</p>
            <p>In theſe Writings how much does he diſcover of Enthuſiaſm, Oſtentation and vain Boaſting of the Spirit's Influence and immediate Conduct to a ſuperlative Degree, as tho' he had arrived to the higheſt Familiarities with the divine Being. As a Specimen of which, I ſhall inſert a few Inſtances extracted from his Journals.— <q>GOD has given me a double Portion of his Spirit indeed.— I ſhould quench the Spirit, did I not go on to ſpeak as He gives me Utterance.—The Eternal Almighty I AM hath ſent me.—This I know, what I have ſpoken, GOD will bring to paſs; lo! It will come, then ſhall Scoffers and Deſpiſers know that a Miniſter of CHRIST has been among them.—Wherever I go People will follow
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005667_0011_1026B9C59E2AC358"/>me—When I ſaid, Finally Brethren, Farewell; Thouſands imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately burſt out into ſtrong Cryings and Tears.—In the Morning I talk'd with the LORD in the Garden, as a Man talketh with his Friend.—It was <hi>revealed</hi> to me that nothing griev'd Satan ſo much as the private Societies.— The Power is ſuch among the Societies that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when they go to ſay Grace before Meat, the Spirit of Prayer falls on them one after another, that they are kept in Prayer near 3 Hours.—Such of the Exhorters as had publick Gifts were ſettled as Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendants over the reſt.—Nothing confirms me more in my Opinion that GOD intends to work a great Work upon Earth, than to find how his Children of all Denominations every where wreſtle in Prayer for me.</q>—</p>
            <p>Such ſuper-intendant Exhorters as Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> ſpeaks of, we may expect, when he becomes Super-intendant here, as many appear to give him the Power.—</p>
            <p>Theſe high Pretenſions to the extraordinary Guidance of the Spirit brings to my Mind a Man whom I once knew, <hi>Thomas Caſe</hi> by Name, of whom Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> writes in his <hi>Mag. Amer.</hi> He pretended as much to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Guidance of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as any in theſe Days; even to <hi>Prophecy and ſpecial Revelation,</hi> but finally prov'd a grand Impoſtor. It was credibly reported by Eye-witneſſes, that at his Meetings (for he had gain'd a great Number of Followers) the People us'd to fall down as with ſtrong convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive-like Fits, with Foamings at their Mouths, remaining for a Time ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and without Senſe. Then <hi>Caſe</hi> and his Company were wont greatly to rejoice, looking on it as a ſure Sign of their Converſion; and therefore ſang and danc'd round them, ſaying, <hi>the Joy! the Joy, Joy, Joy!</hi> — with extatick Appearance and Geſtures. Theſe Perſons us'd to ſing in the Streets and high-Ways as they paſs'd along, and ſo were diſtinguiſh'd from other Sectaries by the Name of <hi>ſinging Quakers</hi> or <hi>Hie-hoes.</hi> It was uſual with him alſo as he paſs'd the Streets at the Head of his Company, and when alone, to cry out (under the Pretence of an extraordinary Miſſion, like that of the Diſciples) <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Thus he proceeded from <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> to <hi>Block-Iſland</hi> and <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> and to the new Country (then call'd) <hi>viz. the Jerſeys,</hi> to <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> and then back again with ſeveral of his Admirers, who ſoon after his Death, finding themſelves deceiv'd of the great Things, which his pretended Predictions had made them expect, they ſoon diſpers'd with ſhame, that they had been led away with ſuch ſtrong Deluſions. And now for many Years the very Name of this Man, and his Company as ſuch, is remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only with Reproach and Contempt, as a deluded Company of People
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005667_0012_1026B9C9D09E2A68"/>who were made to believe a Lie. I offer this Inſtance not as a Parallel, but by way of Caution; leſt any ſhould in like Manner be led away with too high an Opinion of the Sanctity, Zeal and Preſence of GOD'S Spirit with <hi>any Man,</hi> and thereby fall into the like Deluſion in this perilous Age.</p>
            <p>—But to return,—</p>
            <p>If Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> had, at this his ſecond coming, ſeen Cauſe publickly to declare, that on better Light receiv'd he thought proper to recede from his ſolemn Oaths and Subſcriptions to practice according to the Rites and Forms of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and had alſo evidenc'd his ſincere Repentance by retracting his raſh and groundleſs Charges thrown on the Miniſtry in general, Colleges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — And had at the ſame Time us'd his Endeavours to ſweeten the Tempers of thoſe whom he had diſaffected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Paſtors and Brethren, and to recover from their unſcriptural Separations, and to return them to their Duty, as one under ſuperiour Advantages for that Purpoſe above all Mankind, conſidering his Influence on them; and had he likewiſe put himſelf under the Quality of a Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for the Miniſtry in order to a ſettled Improvement in any of theſe Churches, or elſe had better anſwer'd the Character of an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> by preaching in un goſpeliz'd Places: I ſay had he done thus, then his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in general would not have lain open to the ſame Cenſure in theſe Churches as now it does. But it is the Opinion of many (and as they think founded on Scripture and Reaſon) that unleſs Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> had come into ſuch Steps as theſe, he ought not to have Admiſſion, much leſs Invitation, to any Gentleman's Desk in the Country, but to be rejected as a <hi>diſorderly walker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alſo Matter of Grief and Surprize to many in the Country to hear that a Reverend Father, (whoſe Praiſe has been in all theſe Churches, and whoſe Character has been bright in this and remote Countries) ſhould now be the firſt of his Order in theſe Parts, to introduce Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> to preach in his Pulpit, and to adminiſter the Sacrament of the LORD'S-Supper in his Church: But 'tis hop'd that for the future, this Inſtance will be improv'd as a Caution rather than an Encouragement to others, in this Day of mighty Expectation, when Example goes beyond Precept. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Honour and Reſpect command us to form a Conſtruction in this Caſe according to conſtant Experience; <hi>viz. That the moſt pious, wiſe and ſingularly accompliſh'd Men are but Men, and evidence themſelves ſuch in more or leſs obvious Inſtances.</hi> Many are as much and ſome more ſtumbled at Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Conduct in this Matter, and think him chargeable with Arrogance and Uſurpation as well Breach of ſolemn Vows and Promiſes. Let that be as it will. — It was certainly a very ſtrange thing
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005667_0013_1026B9CB72B4AEB0"/>that a Gentleman under his Circumſtances, and doubtleſs acquainted with the Order of theſe Churches, ſhould make ſuch a Puſh at our Conſtitution, unleſs it was with a Deſign to overthrow it, and with this View, — The ſooner the better.—</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to enquire here, whether the Brethren of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were led into this ſtep of Innovation, as free Agents, or thro' ſurprize? We charitably hope they have ſeen their Error and are feelingly qualifyed to become Monitors to themſelves and others for the future.</p>
            <p>Who can Account for the like Meaſures come into, in ſome other Churches? Unleſs the high Eſteem of this Gentleman has led them ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly to imagine, that the Elements in that Holy Ordinance are ſo much the more ſacred and efficacious, when receiv'd from his Hands. Have they forgotten their Catechiſm which tells them, that <hi>The Sacraments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come effectual Means of Salvation, not from any Virtue in them, or in him that doth adminiſter them; but only be the Bleſſing of CHRIST, and the working of his SPIRIT in them, that by Faith receive them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a criminal ſilence would it be, after all the formentioned Evils which are come upon us, <hi>when our Breach is great as the Sea,</hi> if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of CHRIST (who are <hi>ſit as Watchmen on the Walls of Jeruſalem</hi>) don't open their Mouths like a Trumpet and warn the People whether they will hear or whether they will forbear. Shall we ſtand as idle unconcern'd Spectators, and as treacherous Dealers, dealing treacherouſly, betray our invaluable Church Privileges into the Hands of our Enemies, and become a willing Prey to them that oppreſs us? <hi>Let the Prieſts then, the Miniſters of the Lord, cry with one conſent, ſaying, ſpare thy People, Oh Lord, and give not thine Heritage to Reproach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were it poſſible for our <hi>venerable Fathers,</hi> whoſe renown'd Heads are laid in the Duſt, to behold ſuch Multitudes, and perhaps not a few of their own dear Offspring, following and applauding enthuſiaſtick Strangers and ignorant Exhorters, whilſt their dear and beloved Brethren ſtand neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed, wounded not only by Enemies, but in the Houſe and by the Hands of their Friends, as not worthy to be compar'd with thoſe of the new make; (I ſay could our Fathers ſee this) with what Indignation would they reprove the early Apoſtacy of their Children, who are turned out of the Way ſo quickly after their Fathers have fallen aſleep? As a Confirmation of this we may conſult many of the Diſcourſes of theſe excellent Worthies, wherein they gave their dying Teſtimonies to the Order of theſe Churches, and charge their Poſterity to endeavour to preſerve it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:005667_0014_1026B9CE764D7D40"/>
Nay even a Stranger that had been kindly receiv'd, and liv'd and died among us in the Work of the Miniſtry, has left us theſe Words as his dying Advice. <q>It was one of the Glories of <hi>New-England,</hi> that they had ſhewn ſo much Reſpect to Miniſters educated abroad;</q> but then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on ſome late Occurences, he added,—<q>That for the future it was adviſeable for us to make a more due Enquiry into the Principles of Strangers that come among us, leſt inſtead of moderate Presbyterians, which the Churches honour &amp; embrace without any diſagreement or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; they ſhould commit themſelves into the Hands of <hi>raſh Incendiaries.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole. If Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Meaſures have the moſt direct Tendency to ſtrengthen the Diſcipline of theſe Churches, to promote Love and good Agreement among Miniſters and Brethren, to eſtabliſh the Reputation of our Colleges, and are the only hopeful Means to bring about a thorough Reformation,—Then let this Gentleman and his Friends rejoice in the Fire which he has kindled, tho' it has already burnt many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Cedars in</hi> our <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and yet continues to flame in theſe Churches with Rage and Violence: But if not,—Then let us all come to a ſtand and conſider, whether the Good ſuppos'd to be done in ſome Places, <hi>can coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail the King's Damage, who is the Head of his Church, and the Glory of it where he walks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now to proceed in the next Place,</p>
            <p>To offer ſome <hi>Healing Meaſures</hi> in order to recover us out of our broken State, and to reſtore Peace and Love.</p>
            <p>They will greatly miſtake my Deſign, who ſuppoſe it to be any other than this, in all that I have offer'd in the former Part of my Letter. It exceedingly grieves me for the Occaſion of it, and I hope it may affect the Hearts of ſome in <hi>reading,</hi> as it does mine in <hi>writing.</hi>

            <p>We find by ſorrowful Experience that wiſe and good Men have fallen into very different Ways of thinking, ſpeaking and acting in Matters of Religion. In purſuing my Purpoſe therefore it may be proper to enquire into the Grounds of our preſent Difference. If I have a true Idea of Things, our preſent Controverſy is not about the fundamental Points of Religion. All agree in the Doctrine of Original Sin, the Neceſſity of Converſion or the New-Birth, of Juſtification by Faith in the Merits of CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Imputation of CHRIST'S Righteouſneſs received by Faith, and good Works or an holy Obedience as a Fruit and Evidence of true Faith. All my Brethren in the Miniſtry, that I am acquainted with, aſſent to theſe Doctrines, and preach them to their Hearers. They can't there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005667_0015_1026B9D0E0FC84E0"/>on this Account with any Propriety be term'd Oppoſers of the Work of GOD. Moreover, if at any Time it has been prov'd againſt any Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, that his Doctrine or Life is not according to the Goſpel, he has by our Conſtitution been removed from his Miniſtry. For what is it then that ſo many of the well-principl'd Servants of CHRIST are at this Day call'd Oppoſers of the Work of GOD? Certainly they have not deſerv'd this odious Character: And it will appear unreaſonable that their ſeparating Brethren have branded them with this Name, if we conſider, What it is they oppoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt Place, they oppoſe the ſo much applauded Method of Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Preaching; becauſe they don't know of any Scripture Warrant to ſupport it: Nor can the Itinerants prove their Miſſion by their miraculous Healing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Evangeliſts of old did,—and it breaks in upon Order which is abſolutely neceſſary to the Support of Religion: For tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there may be external Order without true Religion, yet true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion can never ſubſiſt long in a Country without Order.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p>They oppoſe publick Exhorters; becauſe they are neither that Order of Men to whom CHRIST has promiſed his Preſence to the End of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> Nor are they of the Number of the <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſors or Teachers, which Chriſt has given for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying the Body of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4 11. Nor are they of the Elderſhip ſpoken of, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. Nor thoſe mentioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. They are therefore to be oppoſed as a ſpurious Offspring, not legitimated in Scripture, but of the Number of falſe Teachers whom the Apoſtle mentions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.17. which ſeems to be exemplified in the Itinerants and publick Exhorters of this Day, <hi>They zealouſly affect you, but not well; yea they would exclude us</hi> (as 'tis render'd in the Margin the true Miniſters of Chriſt) <hi>that you may affect them</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch therefore as theſe Men take this Honour to themſelves, when they are neither called of GOD, nor can they produce any Teſtimony or Example from Scripture to ſupport their Pretences, Duty and Intereſt calls upon both Miniſters and Churches to oppoſe them, and the Errors and Diſorders they have introduced. It is good to be zealouſly affected in a good Thing, for which ſome are to be commended at this Day: But when Zeal for Reformation is beclouded with uncharitable Judgings of Fellow-Chriſtians, it is not according to Knowledge, and therefore ſhould be watch'd with Caution. One ſays, <q>Take heed that when Zeal for Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation knocks at the Door, ſome new Error ſteps not in with it, which will as much need an after-Reformation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:005667_0016_1026B9D42C9E4D60"/>
Moreover, They oppoſe (not the regular Conduct of thoſe who have appear'd to be wrought on in a genuine evangelical Manner, but) that unlimited Liberty which many have given themſelves, to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the State of others; even thoſe who are of known Orthodox Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and unblemiſhed Lives. This is not warranted, but ſtrictly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Scripture, as might be abundantly prov'd.</p>
            <p>They oppoſe Dreams, Viſions, Revelations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and bodily Appearances of CHRIST to the natural Sight of the Eye, which many have lately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to: As tho' the holy Scriptures were not a compleat Syſtem of Divine Revelation, and ſufficient Rule of Life, but that we ſtill ſtood in need of ſomething farther to direct us in point of our Faith and Practice: Which muſt be denied, and conſequently oppoſed, as that which leads into manifold dangerous Errors and Deluſions.</p>
            <p>The extraordinary Out-cries and bodily Agitations in Time of divine Worſhip, ſo common in Aſſemblies, and applauded by many as Signs of the Spirit's powerful Operation, is objected againſt, as no ways profitable to Souls, but an hindrance of the true Ends of Worſhip. Preaching is a rational as well as a religious Act, both in the Preacher and Hearer of the Word; but theſe Out-cries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> deſtroy both. It would be ſtrange to conceive, that there were cryings-out in the Congregation when <hi>Samuel</hi> reaſoned with the People to convince them of their Sin, in asking a King; and what can he mean when he ſaith, <hi>Now therefore ſtand ſtill that I may reaſon with you before the Lord,—1 Sam.</hi> 12.7. But that they ſhould give their united Attention to his Reaſonings with them? Or how was it poſſible their Reaſon ſhould be duely exerciſed, or the true Ends of his Preaching anſwered, which as I ſaid was for their Conviction? And it prov'd effectual as we may ſee in the following part of the Chapter; and why did it ſo? becauſe they ſtood ſtill, i. e. they were not noiſy and tumultuous.—The like Inſtance we have in <hi>Paul,</hi> when he reaſoned of <hi>Righteouſneſs, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and Judgment to come,</hi> Acts 24.25. it is ſaid, <hi>Felix trembled.</hi> He reaſoned,—but what Effect could his Reaſoning have had on <hi>Felix</hi> if it were obſtructed by Out cries? Or on <hi>Agrippa,</hi> when he was <hi>almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to be a Chriſtian,</hi> Acts 26.28.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, That quick and inſtantaneous Aſſurance many now boaſt of, is juſtly objected againſt. As they pretend, it follows immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon their recovery out of ſtrong Convictions for Sin, and when the Mind is calm'd, and Terrors of the Law worn off, they preſently arrive at Aſſurance, which is dangerous to the Souls of Men; for ſuch an Aſſurance Hypocrites themſelves reſt upon. That Aſſurance, in its true meaning, is attainable in this Life, none of the Orthodox deny; but hold
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005667_0017_1026B9D6E8857D48"/>that according to the ordinary Method of Grace, GOD leads true Believers to reſt in a well-grounded ſcriptural Hope of Juſtification thro' the Merits of CHRIST, evidenc'd by the Mortification of Sin in them, and lively Actings of Grace, in a Life of ſweet and holy Communion with GOD: Such an Aſſurance is to be depended upon; and not ſuch an one as riſes like a Muſhroom, or as <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd, that grows in a Night and periſhes as in a Night.</p>
            <p>That prevailing Opinion alſo, That all true Converts muſt know the Time and Circumſtances of their Converſion, is juſtly to be objected to; for as CHRIST is Lord of his own Grace, he beſtows when, to whom, in what Manner and Meaſure he pleaſes. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was ſanctified in the Womb; and <hi>Samuel</hi> we may conceive was ſanctified then, or ſoon after in his Childhood: <hi>Timothy</hi> knew the Scriptures from a Child. Some GOD reveals himſelf to in a gradual Way, under the Means of Grace and the Spirit's Operation, that are made effectual by his Bleſſing for their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and others in a more apparent, ſenſible Manner, as he did to <hi>Paul:</hi> Which different Method of Grace CHRIST ſhews by the Compariſon he uſes, <hi>John</hi> 3.8. CHRIST as much prov'd the Sovereignty of his Grace in opening the Eyes of the blind Man by weak and gradual Means, <hi>John</hi> 9.6.7. as he did by unſtoping the deaf Man's Ears with a Word ſpeaking <hi>Mark</hi> 7.34.</p>
            <p>The laſt Thing I ſhall offer here by way of Objection in the preſent Caſe, is that prevailing Practice of having ſome Miniſters Perſons in ſuch high Admiration, as in a ſort to Deify them. GOD has given different Gifts to Miniſters as well as others; and as thoſe of ſuperiour Qualifications are not to be overvalued, neither ſhould thoſe of lower Gifts and Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be deſpiſed: In theſe Caſes its often that People are acted more by Fancy than Judgment, which ſeems too much our preſent Caſe. This was what the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> faulted the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> for, as they liſted themſelves, ſome under one Miniſter, and ſome under another, and tells them they were carnal and walk'd as Men, not as Chriſtians, and he gives the Reaſons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3, 4. This too high Eſteem of one Miniſter, and too low Eſtimation of another, led them into Envying, Strife, and Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the neceſſary Conſequence of ſuch a Conduct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this Practice of theirs, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 13. And complains of their Contentions, <hi>One ſaith, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>another I am of</hi> Apollos, <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am of</hi> Cephas, <hi>or</hi> Peter, <hi>another I am of</hi> Chriſt. Then <hi>v.</hi> 13. he proceeds farther to detect this Corruption by <hi>ſaying, is Chriſt divided? was</hi> Paul <hi>crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the Name of</hi> Paul? Now as this Caſe is become ſo remarkably ours at this Day, I ſuppoſe it not amiſs to gloſs a little on the Text above cited and ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005667_0018_1026B9D882B20C58"/>
1. That nothing (ordinarily) has a more direct Tendency to break the Peace of fellow-Chriſtians and Churches, and throw them into Envyings, Strife, Diviſions and Contentions, than when they fall into Parties, from a different and too high eſteem of one Miniſter above all others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The true Miniſters of CHRIST will aim more at the Glory of GOD the Peace, Unity and good Order of his Church and Churches, than at the higheſt popular Applauſe and partiſan Acclamations of Praiſe. This we find in <hi>Paul,</hi> tho' firſt in order, and perhaps the Number of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers and Followers exceeded the reſt of the Miniſters, yet, his faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to CHRIST, and his Zeal to reſtore Peace in this Church, led him in ſo ſharp a Manner to reprove their Sin and ſeparating Diſpoſitions. Which is left as an Example for all CHRIST'S Miniſters, and for the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Inſtruction of his Churches and People in every after-Age and Generation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third Thing I ſhall note from the Apoſtle's Words above, is, that when Churches, or the profeſſed Followers of JESUS CHRIST fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Parties from their different Eſteem of Miniſters, it is then moſt probable CHRIST will have the ſmalleſt Numbers of ſincere Followers on his Side—For we find ſome were for <hi>Paul</hi> others for <hi>Apollos,</hi> others were for <hi>Cephas,</hi> here were three Parts of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſome for one, and others for another Miniſter, CHRIST could therefore have but a very ſmall Part among them: It is therefore obſervable, he ſaith, is CHRIST divided, or do you expect to find CHTIST dividing himſelf into theſe Miniſters; and to prove the contrary, he ſaith, was <hi>Paul,</hi> or any of theſe Miniſters you ſo much admire, crucified for you? Or were you baptized in his or any other of their Names? As the Words and Senſe of the Thing Import.</p>
            <p>Inaſmuch then as theſe ſeveral Heads of Particulars, mentioned above, are what make and foment our Diviſions, and are not ſupported either by Scripture or Reaſon, Can the Conduct of thoſe be juſtified who brand the Characters of their Paſtors and Brethren as Oppoſers of the Work of GOD, and under that received Notion, unwarrantably ſeparate from them?—It was with great Satisfaction indeed, that the pious and well-meaning People in general, in the ſeveral Governments here, at firſt receiv'd the Tydings of thoſe remarkable Awakenings that many, and eſpecially thoſe of the younger Sort, ſeem'd to be brought under; and it is Matter of great Thankfulneſs to GOD, that their Hopes have been ſo far anſwer'd, as that there are Evidences of ſome Perſons who have been ſavingly wrought on, and brought home to CHRIST in theſe Times of Commotion, in one Place and another, as in Charity we are oblig'd to believe: Yet nothing is more evident than that the State of Religion is in a more languiſhing Condition
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005667_0019_1026B9DC324333E8"/>in our Churches in general, than ever before has been known in the Memory of Man. Where is the Reformation, ſo much talk'd of, to be found, except in a few Places? Nor can it in Reaſon be ſuppos'd that a noble Structure can be built without a ſolid and proper Foundation; nor when the principal Artificers pull down with one Hand what they build up with the other; which appears too much our unhappineſs, and is Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Lamentation, and ſhall be for a Lamentation; and the more ſo, if after all the Means of Conviction and Healing that can be offered, the Language and Reſolutions of the Times remain as of old, ſaying, there <hi>is no hope, no, for we have choſen Strangers, and after them we will go;</hi> which GOD forbid: For without a wonderful Interpoſition of Providence to reſtore our loſt and long baniſhed Peace, what can be expected, as an Event of the prevailing Contentions and Separations, but the utter Demolition of theſe Churches, and the Conſtitution on which they are ſo happily found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The prudent Man foreſeeth the Evil and hideth himſelf; it highly behoves us to hide our ſelves in this evil Day under the Covert of CHRIST'S Wing, and pray for that Wiſdom which is from above, and is profitable to direct us in this critical Juncture, to throw off the different Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and disband the contending Parties, Uniting in Love as CHRIST'S myſtical Body and Members in particular, and as ſuch conforming our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as much as in us lies to Goſpel Commands, which in no Part of it that (I know of) will juſtify, but contrary-wiſe condemn our ſubſiſting Heats and Animoſities and Methods, in which they are carried on in the general, on the one ſide, and on the other. I therefore humbly recommend that Text of many others that might be offered, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. <hi>If there be therefore any Conſolation in Chriſt, if any Comfort of Love, if any Fellowſhip of the Spirit, if any Bowels and Mercies, fullfil ye my Joy. — That ye be like-minded, having the ſame Love, being of one Accord, of one Mind; let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done through Strife, or vain Glory; but in lowlineſs of Mind, let each Eſteem other better than themſelves.</hi> Now then as the <hi>End of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is Charity,</hi> out of a pure Heart, — which we are commanded above all Things to put on, and as Chrſtians to arm our ſelves with, as by it we are led to hope and believe the beſt Things one of another, and to cover a Multitude of Faults and Imperfections we ſee one in another; and as vital Piety and practical Chriſtianity conſiſts ſo much in the right Exerciſe of this Grace of Charity, and by the want of it ſo much the more in Proportion, will Contentions be ſtrengthned and abound among Chriſtian Profeſſors, as our preſent and very ſorrowful Experience does Evidence, let us all throw off an uncharitable cenſorious judging, diviſive Diſpoſition, and be deeply humbled before GOD has who ſuffered Satan that Accuſer of the Brethren to ſow the Seeds of Diſcord among us, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005667_0020_1026B9DFB97D8F50"/>animated them, thro' his ſubtle Inſinuations, to become Accuſers one of another in this Day of Temptation, too much whereof is to be found on one Side, and the other.</p>
            <p>It was once a wiſe and very ſeaſonable Enquiry made by a Captain and Leader in <hi>Iſrael, — Shall the Sword devour for ever?</hi> An Enquiry highly applicable, and with great Propriety to be impreſſed on the Minds of all, in theſe Times, eſpecially thoſe that appear foremoſt in promoting the preſent Controverſy: Then it follows, <hi>Knoweſt thou not that it will be bitterneſs in the latter end?</hi> An Admonition, truly worthy to be writ in Capital Letters of the largeſt Size, and fixt in all Places of publick Reſort, that <hi>they who run may read and learn to leave off Contention, before it be further meddled with.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I am free from an Attachment to a Party, but if I know my own Heart ſincerely deſirous, that <hi>that</hi> Peace and <hi>that</hi> Charity, without which our Religion is vain, and that Truth and Holineſs may be reſtored, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, eſtabliſhed, and more and more abound among us, I ſhall addreſs my Brethren, thoſe Churches, and my Country, in the Words of a late<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Flavel.</note> excellent and approved Writer in a like Time of growing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention. — <q>For my own Part, It is my fixed Reſolution to provoke no good Man, if I can help it; but if their own inveterate Zeal ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them in purſuit of their Errors or Miſconduct, — I will ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly contend in the Cauſe of Truth: — I have ſincerely aimed at the Purity and Peace of the Church of GOD; and he greatly miſtakes that takes me for a Man of Contention, — But an hearty Deſire and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Motion for Peace among all the profeſs'd Members of CHRIST.—Let all Letigations of this Nature (at leaſt in this critical Juncture) be ſuſpended by common Conſent, ſince they waſte our Time, hinder our Communion, imbitter our Spirits, impoveriſh practical Godlineſs, grieve the Spirit of GOD and good Men, make Sport for our common Enemies, who warm their own Fingers at the Fire of our Contentions, and place more Truſt in our dividing Luſts, than they do in their own feeble Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</q>—</p>
            <p>To conclude, My Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God, is, that all who love theſe Churches of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and that pray for their Peace &amp; Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, would labour to their utmoſt to allay Animoſities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and eminently the Miniſters of CHRIST thro' the Land; by their Doctrine, Example, and Influence, endeavouring to turn the Hearts of this People to CHRIST, and one towards another, in the ſtrongeſt Ties of Charity and united Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Then, and not till then, may we hope to <hi>ſee Jeruſalem a quiet Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation and a Praiſe in the Earth.</hi>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>WHOEVER impartially conſults the Antiquities of <hi>New-England,</hi> will find that many of theſe Churches in their infant State, were infeſted with <hi>Antinomian, Enthuſiaſtick</hi> and many other Errors, which gave them and the People of GOD here much trouble: As a direct and neceſſary Effect of ſuch Errors, nothing leſs can be expected but Factions and Parties, evil Surmiſings and open Reflections, on ſuch eſpecially as adhere to the Truth, and labour to ſtem the Torrent of Corruption flowing in upon them: Thus it was in that Day, and thus it is with us in this Day of our <hi>Zion</hi>'s Trouble, as ſorrowful Experience teaches us.</p>
            <p>The faithful Miniſters of CHRIST were then loaded with Obloquy and open Contempt, termed, <q>No better than legal Preachers, <hi>Baal</hi>'s Prieſts, Popiſh Factors, Scribes, Phariſees, and oppoſers of CHRIST himſelf — Such a Church-Officer is an ignorant Man, and knows not CHRIST: Such an one is under a <hi>Covenant of Works:</hi> Such a Paſtor is a proud Man, and would make a good <hi>Perſecutor:</hi> Such a Teacher is groſly Popiſh.—That they did not preach the <hi>Covenant of free Grace,</hi> and that they themſelves had not the Seal of the Spirit, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And in theſe Times (as the ſame Author obſerves) <q>You might ſee many of the Opinioniſts riſing up and contemptuouſly turning their Backs upon the <hi>faithful Paſtor</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> and going forth from the Aſſembly when he began to Pray or Preach.</q>—</p>
            <p>Then alſo, <q>You might have ſeen open Contempt caſt upon the Face of the whole General-Court in ſubtle Words, to this very Effect, that the Magiſtrates were <hi>Ahab</hi>'s, <hi>Amaziab</hi>'s, Scribes and Phariſees, Enemies to CHRIST, led by Satan, that old Enemy of free Grace; and that it were <hi>better that a Mill-ſtone were hung about their Necks,</hi> and they <hi>were drowned in the Sea,</hi> than they ſhould cenſure one of their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>—</p>
            <p>The worthy Author proceeds to ſay, <q>By a little taſte of a few Paſſages (inſtead of Multitudes) here preſented, you may ſee what a Height they were grown to in a ſhort Time; and what a Spirit of Pride, Inſolency,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005667_0022_1026B9E400566D00"/>Contempt of Authority, Diviſion, Sedition, they were acted by. It was a wonder of Mercy that they had not ſet our Common wealth and Churches on fire, and conſumed us all therein.</q>—</p>
            <p>Theſe are a few Hints taken from the Rev. Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s Preface to his Book, entitled, — <hi>Seaſonable Thoughts on the State of Religion in</hi> NEW-ENGLAND. — A Performance aptly calculated to obviate the Objections of the preſent Day, raiſed in our Churches againſt Miniſters and others, by Perſons of the like cenſorious corrupt Diſpoſitions, with thoſe refer'd to above. Would to GOD, there were more found among us of the like Zeal and Concern for theſe Churches of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, with the renowned Patriots of the firſt Times, who have endeared their Memory to after-Poſterities, by bearing down thoſe Errors than then did ſo ſadly aſſault them, like theſe which we now feel the miſerable Effects of.</p>
            <p>It may alſo ſerve for our Caution to take a ſhort View of ſome later Occurences of the like kind, which fall within the Compaſs of the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of many of us, as we find them tranſmitted from a Number of our venerable Fathers (two of whom are yet ſurviving<note n="*" place="bottom">The venerable Mr. <hi>Nehemiah Walter</hi> and Dr. <hi>Colman.</hi>
               </note>) bearing the Title of <hi>A faithful Advice from ſeveral Miniſters of the Goſpel, in and near</hi> Boſton, <hi>unto the Churches of</hi> New England; <hi>Relating to the Dangers that may ariſe from Impoſtors, pretending to be Miniſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manifeſt Reaſons leading to the Publication of this faithful Advice was partly from a Number of illiterate and unqualified Perſons in Succeſſion, who appeared <hi>in their Day,</hi> to ſet up for Preachers; who were of the like make with the numerous Exhorters of theſe Times, and partly from the over-fondneſs of the People (eſpecially the weaker ſort) to hear them, which is alſo remarkably exemplified among us in this our Day—As a Proof whereof we have the Teſtimony of the Rev. Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtory of ſome Impoſters,</hi> — annexed to the above Advice, and written to maintain it, as he there <hi>tells us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor gives a Relation in that ſhort Hiſtory of ſeveral of theſe Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters appearing on the Stage; and alſo the Manner of their Exit, within the Compaſs of Time, between 1624 and 1699. I ſhall for brevity ſake take Notice here only of one <hi>Samuel May,</hi> (who appeared the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in that Account) as the moſt remarkable in the Influence he had on many of the People in <hi>Boſton.</hi> Of this <hi>Samuel May</hi> the Dr. writes thus,—<q>
                  <hi>Faſcination</hi> is a Thing whereof Mankind has more <hi>Experience</hi> than <hi>Comprehenſion;</hi> and <hi>Facination</hi> is never more notoriouſly ſenſible, than in Men's running after Falſe Teachers of Religion. — One cannot
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005667_0023_1026B9E6774C6710"/>eaſily aſcribe unto a truer Cauſe than a <hi>ſatanick Energy,</hi> the ſtrange <hi>Biaſs</hi> upon the Minds of a Multitude, forcibly, and furiouſly; ſometimes carrying them into Follies, from whence the plaineſt Reaſon in the World will not reclaim them: What but ſuch an <hi>Energy</hi> could be upon the Minds of many People in <hi>Boſton,</hi> after the arrival of one that went by Name of <hi>Samuel May,</hi> about the Beginning of <hi>July,</hi> 1699? The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Succeſs of <hi>Mahomet</hi> upon a World where Chriſtianity was to another Degree loſt, than it is yet in <hi>Boſton,</hi> was no longer a wonder to us, when we ſaw the Succeſs of <hi>May,</hi> in a Place of ſo Chriſtian a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as <hi>Boſton.</hi>—It was all over pure <hi>Enchantment.</hi> — So ſilly and ſhallow a Perſon he was, that it was impoſſible for any but <hi>ſuch,</hi> to be many Minutes in his Company without being ſenſible of it. The firſt Thing that made ſome to ſuſpect him was, his uſing to lift up his Eyes and Hands, with Strains of Devotion, uſed by none others in the Aſſembly. He was able to imitate a plauſible Utterance and Action, and ſeem'd ſo zealouſly ſet upon <hi>inviting Men to CHRIST,</hi> that after Sermon was over he would make another Speech to put them in Mind on't. Abundance of the People became ſo fiercely ſet for him, that they pour'd out a Thouſand Expreſſions of Rage, upon the Faithful Paſtors of the Town.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He proceeds to ſay—</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Diſciples of this <hi>Money-Catcher,</hi> became ſo exceeding fierce many of them, that ſome ſober Men, became afraid of <hi>paſſing by that Way,</hi> where one muſt encounter them; tho' he were detected in ſeveral Crimes, — yet his Followers would go on, making <hi>Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Apologies</hi> for him, and <hi>malicious Invectives</hi> againſt any that would not believe him an <hi>Eminent Saint.</hi> Yea, they began to throw Libels into the Houſes of the Miniſters, the moſt Inſolent that ever I ſaw.</p>
            </q>
            <p>He proceeds to ſhew the <hi>Reflections</hi> the Miniſters made on the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the People, that were <hi>May</hi>'s Admirers, which was to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, — That however long and indefatigably, they had endeavour'd to ſerve them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
               <q>yet if any <hi>Wolf in Sheeps Cloathing</hi> do come with a few good Words among them; the ſimple Souls of many, will not only follow the Wolf, but on his Account bark at the Shepherds.</q>— Applicable to what we now ſee and feel tragically acted among us.</p>
            <p>The Invaſions theſe Impoſtors made on the Churches, as has been noted, moved our Fathers (above hinted at) to offer their Opinions on theſe Things, apprehenſive of Danger in Time to come, and have left this their <hi>Faithful Advice</hi> as a laſting Teſtimony and Caution to theſe Churches for the future. A few Paragraphs whereof, I ſhall Tranſcribe, with their Names, for the Benefit of the Publick.—</p>

They ſay thus,—</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is not without ſome Concern on our Minds, that in the late Writings of our <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> we find awful Complaints about <hi>bold Intruders</hi> into the Work of the Miniſtry,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> — And then they go on, and expreſs their <hi>Satisfaction</hi> in the Care that had been taken by their Brethren at Home, to prevent thoſe <hi>Confuſions.</hi> Pag. 3. by a <hi>Vote</hi> of this Importance, <q>That they would employ none to <hi>Preach</hi> in any of their Pulpits, but ſuch as either arrived unto them with credible <hi>Teſtimonials,</hi> or ſubmitted themſelves unto a ſolemn <hi>Trial</hi> of their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications for the evangelical Miniſtry.</q> 
               <hi>P.</hi> 4. And in <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. they ſay, <q>In Conformity to this <hi>Watchfulneſs</hi> of our <hi>united Brethren,</hi> we cannot but in the moſt Publick Manner, call upon our Churches, that they beware of all undue <hi>Precipitancy,</hi> in their admitting <hi>unquallified Perſons,</hi> to be received and employed, in the Character of <hi>Preachers</hi> unto them.</q>—See, Page 6. — <q>We do alſo ſolemnly adviſe all our People to beware of running after <hi>new Preachers</hi> of whoſe Endowments and Principles they have not had a reaſonable Atteſtation, leſt they unawares run themſelves into ſhameful and woful Reflections. —</q> And in Page 8, they ſay, <q>We are not unſenſible, that one Thing which has much expoſed ſome <hi>injudicious People</hi> among us is, an Opinion that <hi>illiterate Men</hi> may be ſerviceable and admirable <hi>Preachers.</hi> Now inaſmuch as the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have given this among their Inſtructions to their Emiſſaries to teach, <hi>that Learning is needleſs in a Miniſter; and if they underſtand the Goſpel, it is ſufficient.</hi> We are ſorry that any of our People ſhould be ſo <hi>beſotted</hi> not to ſay ſo <hi>be-jeſuited.</hi> When the Knowledge of the Tongues and Arts revived, Religion had a Revival with it: And tho' ſome unlearned Men have been uſeful to the Intereſts of <hi>Religion;</hi> yet no Man ever decried <hi>Learning</hi> but what was an Enemy to Religion, whether he knew it or no.</q>—And then to conclude, they ſay Page 9, 10. </p>
