            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Reign of our dread and rightful Sovereign KING GEORGE the Second; howſoever pleaſing and profitable it might be at any other time, would, at this Juncture, prove, if not an irkſome, yet an unſeaſonable Undertaking.——</p>
            <p>The Occaſion of the late Solemnity, I mean the Suppreſſion of a moſt horrid and <hi>unnatural Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> will afford more than ſufficient Matter for a Diſcourſe of this Nature, and furniſh us with abundant Motives to love and obey that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Jehovah, who giveth</hi> SALVATION <hi>unto</hi> KINGS, <hi>and delivers His People from the hurtful Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Need I make an Apology, before this Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, if, in order to ſee the Greatneſs of our late Deliverance, I ſhould remind you of the many unſpeakable Bleſſings which we have for a Courſe of Years enjoy'd, during the Reign of His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent MAJESTY, and the gentle mild Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration under which we live?—Without juſtly incurring the Cenſure of <hi>giving flattering Titles</hi> I believe all who have Eyes to ſee, and Ears to hear, and are but a little acquainted with our publick Affairs, muſt acknowledge, that we have one of the beſt of KINGS.—It is now above <hi>Nineteen Years</hi> ſince he began to reign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Us—And yet, was he to be ſeated on a Royal Throne, and were all his Subjects placed before him. Was he to addreſs them as <hi>Samuel</hi> once addreſſed the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 
               <q>Behold here I am, <hi>Old and Greyheaded,</hi> witneſs againſt me before the Lord, whoſe Ox have I taken? Or whoſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005883_0006_102759C21D6F6A68"/>
Aſs have I taken? Or whom have I defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Whom have I oppreſſed?</q> They muſt, if they would do him Juſtice, make the ſame Anſwer as was given to <hi>Samuel,</hi> 
               <q>Thou haſt not defrauded us, nor oppreſſed us.</q> What <hi>Tertullus,</hi> by way of Flattery, ſaid to <hi>Felix,</hi> may with the ſtricteſt Juſtice be applied to our Sovereign, <q>By thee we enjoy great Quietneſs, and very worthy Deeds have been done unto our Nation by thy Providence.</q>—He has been indeed <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> a Father to our Country, and, tho' old and greyheaded, has jeoparded his precious Life for us in the High Places of the Field.—Nor has he leſs deſerved that great and glorious Title which the Lord promiſes KINGS ſhould ſuſtain in the latter Days, I mean, <hi>a nurſing Father of the Church.</hi>—For not only the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as by Law eſtabliſhed, but <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of every Denomination whatſoever have enjoyed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, as well as civil, Liberties.—As there has been no <hi>authorized</hi> Oppreſſion in the State, ſo there has been no <hi>publickly allowed</hi> Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church—We breathe indeed in a free Air; as free (if not freer) both as to temporals and ſpirituals, as any Nation under Heaven.—Nor is the Proſpect likely to terminate in his MAJES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY's Death, which I pray GOD long to defer. —Our Princeſſes are diſpoſed of to Proteſtant Powers—And we have great Reaſon to be <hi>aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> that the preſent <hi>Heir Apparent,</hi> and <hi>His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,</hi> are like minded with their Royal Father.—
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005883_0007_102759C6ADA5AF28"/>
And I cannot help thinking, that it is a peculiar Bleſſing vouchſafed us by the KING of KINGS, that his preſent MAJESTY has been continued ſo long among us—For now His <hi>immediate Succeſſor</hi> (though his preſent Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obliges him, as it were, to lie <hi>dormant</hi>) has great and glorious. Opportunities, which we have Reaſon to think he daily improves, of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and weighing the national Affairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the various Steps and Turns of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and conſequently of laying in a large Fund of Experience to make him a wiſe and great Prince, if ever GOD ſhould call him to ſway the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sceptre—Happy art thou, O <hi>England!</hi> Happy art thou, O <hi>America,</hi> who on every ſide are thus highly favoured!</p>
            <p>But, alas! how ſoon would this happy Scene have ſhifted, and a melancholly gloomy Proſpect have ſucceeded in its room, had the Rebels gained their Point, and a Popiſh abjured Pretender been forced upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Throne!—For, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Birth not to be <hi>ſpurious,</hi> (as we have great Reaſon to think it really was) what could we expect from one, deſcended from a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, when <hi>Duke of York,</hi> put all <hi>Scotland</hi> into Confuſion, and afterwards, when crowned KING of <hi>England,</hi> for his Arbitrary and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Government both in Church and State, was juſtly obliged to abdicate the Throne, by the Aſſertors of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberty? Or, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the horrid Plot firſt hatched in Hell, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005883_0008_102759CAF04E3218"/>
afterwards nurſed at <hi>Rome,</hi> had taken Place; ſuppoſing, I ſay, the old Pretender ſhould have exchanged his <hi>Cardinal's Cap</hi> for a <hi>Triple Crown,</hi> and have transferred his pretended Title (as it is reported he has done) to his <hi>Eldeſt Son,</hi> what was all this for, but that, by being advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Popedom,</hi> he might rule both Son and Subjects with leſs controul, and, by their united Intereſt, keep the three Kingdoms of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> in greater Vaſſalage to the See of <hi>Rome?</hi> Ever ſince this <hi>unnatural Rebellion</hi> broke out, I have looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the young Pretender as the <hi>Phaeton</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age.—He is ambitiouſly and preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aiming to ſeat himſelf in the Throne of our rightful Sovereign KING GEORGE, which he is no more capable of <hi>maintaining</hi> than PHAETON was to guide the <hi>Chariot of the Sun</hi>; and had he ſucceeded in his Attempt, like him, would only have ſet the World on Fire.—It is true, to do him Juſtice, he has deſerved well of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and, in all probability, will hereafter be canonized amongſt the <hi>noble Order</hi> of their <hi>fictitious Saints</hi>—But, with what an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Rod we might expect to have been bruized, had his Troops been Victorious, may eaſily be imagin'd from thoſe <hi>cruel</hi> Orders, found in the Pockets of ſome of his Officers, <hi>"Give no Quarter to the Elector</hi>'s <hi>Troops.</hi>"—Add to this, that there was great Reaſon to ſuſpect, that, upon the firſt News of the Succeſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005883_0009_102759CC79BD3C18"/>
a <hi>general Maſſacre</hi> was intended—So that if the Lord had not been on our ſide, <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> not to ſay <hi>America,</hi> would, in a few Weeks, or Months, have been an <hi>Accidama,</hi> a <hi>Field of Blood.</hi>—Beſides, was a <hi>Popiſh Pretender</hi> to rule over us, inſtead of being repreſented by a <hi>free Parliament,</hi> and governed by Laws made <hi>by their Conſent,</hi> as we now are, we ſhould ſhortly have had only the <hi>Shadow</hi> of one, and, it may be, no Parliament at all.—This is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Product of a <hi>Popiſh Government,</hi> and what the unhappy Family, from which this YOUNG ADVENTURER pretends to be deſcended, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aimed at.—Arbitrary Principles he has ſucked in with his Mother's Milk; and if he had been ſo honeſt, inſtead of that immature Motto upon his Standard, <hi>Tandem triumphans,</hi> only to have put, <hi>Stet pro Ratione Voluntas,</hi> he had given us a ſhort, but true, Portraiture of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his intended, but, bleſſed be GOD, now defeated Reign.—And, why ſhould I mention, that the Loſs of the <hi>national Debt,</hi> and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the preſent <hi>happy Union</hi> between the two Kingdoms, would have been the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Conſequences of his Succeſs, as he himſelf declares in his ſecond Manifeſto, dated from <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rood Houſe</hi>? Theſe are Evils, and great ones too; but then they are only Evils of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Nature—They chiefly concern the Body, and muſt neceſſarily terminate in the Grave— But, alas! What an Inundation of ſpiritual

five Hundred Spaniards,</hi> from a <hi>weak</hi> (tho' <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant) Frontier Colony,</hi> when they had, in a Manner, actually <hi>taken Poſſeſſion</hi> of it.—His giving us <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> one of the <hi>ſtrengeſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes</hi> of our Enemies, contrary to all human Probability, but the other Day, into our Hands, (Which may encourage our Hopes of <hi>Succeſs,</hi> ſuppoſing it carried on in a <hi>like Spirit,</hi> in our intended <hi>Canada Expedition</hi>)—Theſe, I ſay, with the <hi>Victory</hi> which you have lately been <hi>commemorating,</hi> are ſuch <hi>national Mercies,</hi> not to mention any more, as will render us ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly <hi>inexcuſable,</hi> if they do not produce a <hi>national Reformation,</hi> and incite us all, with one Heart, <hi>to obſerve God's Statutes, and keep his Laws.</hi>

            <p>Need I remind you further, in order to <hi>excite</hi> in you a greater <hi>Diligence</hi> to <hi>comply</hi> with the Intent of the Text, that tho' the Storm, in a great Meaſure is <hi>abated</hi> by his <hi>Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's</hi> late <hi>Succeſs,</hi> yet we dare not ſay, <hi>it is altogether blown over?</hi>

            <p>The Clouds may again return after the Rain; and the few ſurviving Rebels (which I pray God avert) may yet be ſuffered to make Head againſt <hi>us</hi>—We are ſtill engaged in a <hi>bloody,</hi> and in all probability, a <hi>tedious</hi> War, with two of the moſt <hi>inveterate Enemies</hi> to the Intereſts of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>—And, tho' I cannot help thinking, that their preſent <hi>Intentions</hi> are ſo <hi>Iniquitous,</hi> their Conduct ſo <hi>perfidious,</hi> and their

               <hi>Schemes</hi> ſo directly derogatory to the Honour of the <hi>moſt High God,</hi> that He will certainly <hi>Humble</hi> them in the <hi>End</hi>; yet, <hi>as all Things,</hi> in this Life, <hi>happen alike to all,</hi> they may for a Time be <hi>dreadful</hi> Inſtruments of <hi>ſcourging</hi> us— If not, God has other <hi>Arrows</hi> in his Quiver to ſmite us with, beſides the <hi>French King,</hi> his <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Majeſty,</hi> or an <hi>abjured Pretender.</hi>—Not only the <hi>Sword,</hi> but <hi>Plague, Peſtilence</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> are under the divine Command—Who knows, but he may ſay to them all, <hi>Paſs through theſe Lands?</hi>—A fatal <hi>Murram</hi> has lately ſwept away abundance of Cattle at Home and abroad—A like <hi>epidemical Diſeaſe</hi> may have a Commiſſion to ſeize our Perſons as well as our Beaſts— Thus GOD dealt with the <hi>Egyptians</hi>— Who dare ſay, He will not deal in the ſame Manner with us?—Has he not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given ſome Symptoms of it?—What great Numbers upon the Continent have been lately taken off by the <hi>Bloody-Flux, Small-Pox,</hi> and <hi>Yellow Fever?</hi> Who can tell what further Judgments are yet in Store? However this is <hi>certain,</hi> the Rod is yet hanging over us;— And, I believe it will be granted, on all ſides, that if ſuch various Diſpenſations of Mercy and Judgment, do not <hi>teach the Inhabitants of any Land to learn Righteouſneſs,</hi> they will only ripen them for a greater Ruin— Give me leave, therefore, to diſmiſs you at this Time with that ſolemn <hi>awful</hi> Warning and Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
