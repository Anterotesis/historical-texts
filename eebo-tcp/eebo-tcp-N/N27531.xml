            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <pb facs="unknown:036687_0005_100A89B1FA85D790"/>
                  <p>A PUBLICATION on the ſubject of diſeaſes, from the pen of a man who has never before turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his attention to medical ſcience or to chymiſtry, is a circumſtance, which, if it does not require an apology, demands at leaſt an explanation.</p>
                  <p>The prevalence of the catarrh, commonly called influenza, in the years 1789 and 90, firſt awakened my curioſity on the ſubject of epidemic diſeaſes. A journey which I made in October 1789, from Hartford to Boſton; and another in March 1790 from Hartford to Albany; led me to obſerve the <hi>progreſſiveneſs</hi> of that diſeaſe, with its other phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</p>
                  <p>The appearance of the ſcarlatina anginoſa in 1793 revived my curioſity, and a ſimilar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, a journey from Hartford to New-York in April of that year, led me to obſerve a progreſſion in that diſeaſe from Weſt to Eaſt. A ſlight attack which my own children ſuffered, in May following, together with a ſimilar attack of many other chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Hartford, and its more violent effects ſome months after, convinced me that the epidemic was <hi>progreſſive</hi> in <hi>malignancy,</hi> as well as in regard to <hi>place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had no other epidemic appeared, my curioſity would probably have ſubſided and been extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. The malignant fever in New-York in 1791, had excited alarm in that city, and was a
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:036687_0006_100A89B575C36998"/>
ſubject of notice in Hartford where I then reſided; but no idea had been conceived, that it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with a peſtilential ſtate of the air, in the United States, which was afterwards to produce more ſerious and general calamities.</p>
                  <p>In autumn 1793 however that peſtilential ſtate of air arrived to its criſis in Philadelphia, where the mortality occaſioned by the yellow fever, ſpread deſtruction and diſmay, from Auguſt to Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The fatality of the diſeaſe ſpread conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thro the United States, and excited apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in Europe.</p>
                  <p>No American citizen could be indifferent to the prevalence of this diſeaſe in his own country. Still it was conceived that the diſtemper might have been produced from imported infection, and that a more rigid execution of the laws relating to quarantine, might prevent a repetition of the calamity. Here reſted apprehenſion and enquiry.</p>
                  <p>But this tranquillity was of ſhort duration. The appearance of the ſame diſeaſe in New-Haven in 1794, and in New-York, Baltimore and Norfolk in 1795, revived my curioſity, with double zeal to ſearch out the cauſes of theſe phenomena, ſo unuſual in this country. The facts which had come to my knowledge, relating to the origin and prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agation of this diſeaſe, led me to ſuſpect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon theory of <hi>infection</hi> to be ill-founded. But as a preliminary to all other enquiries, it appeared neceſſary to ſettle the controverſy relative to the <hi>imported</hi> or <hi>domeſtic</hi> ſources of the diſtemper; for without, a deciſion of this queſtion, legiſlative and police-regulations, for preventing a return of the
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:036687_0007_100A89B701BA2768"/>
evil, or mitigating its ſeverity, would probably be fruitleſs. The queſtion appeared to be extremely important, and the differences of opinion on the ſubject, among medical gentlemen, ſeemed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the poſſibility of a deciſion among them, that ſhould ſilence doubts in the public mind.</p>
                  <p>In this ſituation of the controverſy, I reſolved to make an effort to obtain evidence which might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the point, in one way or the other; and as facts only can be relied on as a ſure baſis of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and theory, I determined to make a collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of facts, from all parts of the United States, where the yellow fever, or other malignant fevers had prevailed, during the preceding years. For this purpoſe, on the 31ſt of October 1795, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed a circular letter to the phyſicians of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, New-York, Baltimore, Norfolk, New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in general, throughout the United States, requeſting them to communicate to me whatever facts had come within their obſervation, which could throw light on the queſtion of the foreign or domeſtic origin of the yellow fever. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which I received a number of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, which were publiſhed in 1796, and to which is prefixed my circular letter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe communications, tho leſs numerous and ſatisfactory than were deſirable, united with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of facts within my own obſervation, <hi>convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> me of the fallacy of the vulgar opinion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the origin of the yellow fever in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, from imported ſources. I found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly that the reports of perſons taken ill, in conſequence of intercourſe with veſſels from the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:036687_0008_100A89B8888E3B38"/>
Weſt-Indies, or with diſeaſed ſeamen, infected cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton or clothing, or the like cauſes, were mere idle tales, raiſed by the ignorant or intereſted, and wholly unſupported by evidence. Scarcely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance could be found, in which the evidence of the propagation of diſeaſe, from imported infection, was ſufficient to render the fact even probable.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the evidence of the origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſeaſe in New-York, Baltimore, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk, Newburyport, Boſton and Charleſton, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be clear and ſatisfactory. In moſt of thoſe places, the fact has never been queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>When the ſame diſeaſe appeared in Philadelphia in 1797; the queſtion of importation or domeſtic origin, again agitated the faculty and the public. The revival of the diſcuſſion, and particularly, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain publications of Dr. William Currie, in the Philadelphia prints, called forth my exertions to unite opinions and ſave the citizens of this country from the diſtraction of meaſures, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow a diviſion of opinions. I conſidered and ſtill conſider the queſtion as reſting principally on fact, and not on medical ſkill; therefore proper to be inveſtigated and diſcuſſed by any man who has leiſure and means, as well as by phyſicians.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations gave riſe to the obſervations which I addreſſed to Dr. Currie, thro the medium of the public papers, in the months of October, November and December 1797. The deſign of theſe obſervations was originally limited to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of proving the yellow fever of our country to be generated by local and domeſtic cauſes, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together the facts which I had collected from
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:036687_0009_100A89BAD43D0F90"/>
various parts of the United States, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of examining the hiſtory and phenomena of peſtilential diſeaſes in other countries, and other periods of the world.</p>
                  <p>In purſuing this object however, I was led inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to examin all the books I could find, on the ſubject of the plague; and the ſubject being new, I found too much pleaſure in proſecuting it, readily to abandon the purſuit. Facts which were new to me were daily preſenting themſelves to my mind; and after three months inveſtigation, I was perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that thoſe facts are of too much importance to philoſophy, to medicin and to human happineſs, not to merit publication. Such is the origin of the preſent treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>When I began my enquiries into the origin of the yellow fever, in 1795, I had no preconceived ſyſtem to maintain. My view was to collect facts and from them to deduce TRUTH. It is not my intention to advance theory over fact; but as far as juſt philoſophy and ſound logic will permit, draw theory from facts, and if poſſible, by fair reaſoning, from the uniform operations of nature, to arrive at fixed principles. If conjectures ſhould in any inſtance be advanced, they will be offered as ſuch, and not as the baſis of practice.</p>
                  <p>As there is a difference of opinion in regard to the cauſes of the plague, and other peſtilential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, as well as in regard to the identity of the yellow fever and plague, I ſhall define my manner of uſing certain terms, which will often occur in the following work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="x" facs="unknown:036687_0010_100A8A9181200E30"/>That peſtilential diſeaſe which uſually, in the Levant, produces ſwellings in the glands, as buboes, I ſhall call the <hi>glandular</hi> or <hi>inguinal</hi> plague.</p>
                  <p>The peſtilential diſeaſe which has afflicted ſome of the cities in America, and is uſually called yellow fever, I ſhall denominate, the <hi>bilious</hi> or <hi>American plague.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Levant plague, ſwellings in the groin, in the arm-pits, and behind the ears, do not, in every caſe, appear; but they are the general diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marks of the true peſtis or plague.</p>
                  <p>In the yellow fever, the ſkin is not, in every caſe, marked by a yellow color; but it is generally the fact, and therefore this form of peſtilence may very well take its denomination from that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of its bilious appearance.</p>
                  <p>Whether theſe are diſeaſe ſpecifically diſtinct, or only the ſame diſeaſe varied and modified by cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, ſeaſon or other circumſtances. is a queſtion that belongs to the faculty. It is ſufficient for my purpoſe to obſerve, that in moſt of the ſymptoms, they agree—that they are peſtilential and greatly to be dreaded by mankind. I ſhall therefore treat them as different forms of the ſame diſeaſe. There may be ſome cauſe for believing that the moiſture of a country, abounding with woods, and marſhy grounds, may occaſion the difference in the color of bodies which fall victims to peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>The words <hi>infection</hi> and <hi>contagion,</hi> are uſed by medical writers and in popular cuſtom, as ſynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and their etymologies warrant the practice. But I conceive there are diſtinctions in this quality or power of diſeaſes, of communicating themſelves
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:036687_0011_100A8A93D1D10130"/>
by contact or near approach, which require to have each its appropriate language.</p>
                  <p>That quality of a diſeaſe which communicates it from a ſick to a well perſon, on ſimply inhaling the breath or effluvia from the perſon of the diſeaſed, at any time and in any place, maybe called <hi>ſpecific contagion.</hi> Such is the contagion of the ſmall-pox and the meaſles, which are therefore called <hi>conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>That quality of a diſeaſe which, tho inſalutary will not communicate it, without the aid of other cauſes, as warm weather, or peculiar ſituation and habit of body, and which requires the healthful perſon to be a conſiderable time, under its influence, to give it effect, may be called <hi>infection.</hi> Such is the quality of the plague, in all its forms, dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and all typhus fevers. It may perhaps be poſſible for the effluvia of thoſe who have theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, to be ſo concentrated and virulent, as to communicate them to a perſon in health, by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inſpiration of air into the lungs. But if ſuch can be the caſe in any inſtance, it is not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtate of thoſe diſeaſes. Even in the plague, many attendants on the ſick never receive the diſeaſe at all; and in moſt caſes, healthful perſons may, for hours, breathe the air of the rooms where the patients are, without any injury.</p>
                  <p>Hence infection is capable of all degrees of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and force, from a ſlight impurity of air, which affects no perſon in health, to that virulent ſtate of air, which will produce vomiting in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuddenly expoſed to it. <hi>Infection</hi> is uſually ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered inactive by ſevere cold; <hi>ſpecific contagion</hi> is
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:036687_0012_100A8A95613845C0"/>
never deſtroyed, but often rendered more active by cold. Hence the winter in northern latitudes uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally puts an end to the plague, but makes no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable alteration in the ſmall-pox. There are ſome exceptions to this remark, as it regards the plague, which will be noticed in the following work.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſtinctions, which will appear, in the courſe of this treatiſe to be well founded, have never been defined or uſed by European phyſicians, ſo far as my information extends; and to the want of them, are to be aſcribed many errors and abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in opinion, as well as warm controverſies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the contagion of the plague.</p>
                  <p>That ſtate of our atmoſphere which produces diſeaſe, or diſpoſes the body to diſeaſe, independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of other cauſes, I call <hi>general</hi> or <hi>primary</hi> conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Synonymous with theſe phraſes, will be uſed a peſtilential ſtate or conſtitution of the air.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>peſtilence</hi> may be uſed as ſynonymous with plague; or as expreſſing all kinds of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and infectious epidemics. I have uſed it in both ſenſes; and often to expreſs an idea of that ſeries of epidemics which are cloſely connected with the plague.</p>
                  <p>Whether theſe diſtinctions are juſt or not, is not very material; it is ſufficient that they will expreſs my ideas in the following treatiſe.</p>

                  <head>SECTION I. Of the diverſity of opinions reſpecting the cauſe and origin peſtilence.</head>
                  <p>FROM the date of the earlieſt hiſtorical records, the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of men have been divided on the ſubject of the cauſes and origin of peſtilential diſeaſes. All enquiries of the philoſopher and the phyſician have hitherto been baffled, and inveſtigations, often repeated, have ended without leading to ſatisfactory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions.</p>
                  <p>In the hiſtory of opinions on this myſterious ſubject, there is a remarkable diſtinction between the ancients and moderns. The ancients derived moſt of their knowledge and ſcience from perſonal obſervation, as they had very few books and little aid from the improvements of their predeceſſors. The philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of antiquity, attentive to changes in the ſeaſons and to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, attempted to trace peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential diſeaſes to extraordinary viciſſitudes in the weather, and to the aſpects of the planets. Modern philoſophers and phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, on the other hand, unable to account for peſtilence on the principle of extraordinary ſeaſons, and diſdaining to admit the influence of the planets to be the cauſe, have reſorted to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible animalculae, and to infection concealed in bales of goods or old clothes, tranſported from Egypt or Conſtantinople, and let looſe, at certain periods, to ſcourge mankind and deſolate the earth.</p>
                  <p>In both periods of the world, the common maſs of people, uſually ignorant and always inclined to believe in the marvellous,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036687_0014_100A8A9BDF922358"/>
have cut the Gordian knot of difficulty, by aſcribing peſtilence to the immediate exerciſe of divine power; under the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the plague is one of the judgments which God, in his wrath, inflicts on mankind to puniſh them for their iniquities.</p>
                  <p>Without deciding on the comparative merit of theſe reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive opinions, it is ſufficient to obſerve, that they are all probably incorrect; and thoſe of the philoſophers, altogether inadequate to explain the origin of peſtilential Epidemics.</p>
                  <p>It may however be of uſe to inſert, in this place, the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the cauſe of peſtilence, given by ſome of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal writers on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Hippocrates, the father of medical ſcience, and a man of very acute obſervation, conſidered peſtilence as the effect of partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular ſeaſons and winds. A peſtilential ſtate or conſtitution of air he deſcribes, as occaſioned by a continuation of ſoutherly winds, and a warm, humid, clouded atmoſphere.</p>
                  <bibl>De morbis vulgaribus, lib. 3.</bibl>
                  <p>Galen followed the ſame theory. He ſays that peſtilent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes ariſe from a putridity of the air; and in another place, <hi>a coeli ſtatu,</hi> from the ſtate of the air or weather.</p>
                  <bibl>p. 627, in Hippoc.—</bibl>
                  <p>It will at once occur to an intelligent reader, that a particular deſcription of weather, producing peſtilence, muſt be principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calculated for a particular country or latitude. The ſtate of ſeaſons which Hippocrates calls <hi>peſtilential,</hi> is evidently calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to produce or augment autumnal diſeaſes in temperate lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; and is preciſely the ſtate of weather which exiſted in the United States in 1795, when the bilious plague prevailed in the cities of New-York, Baltimore and Norfolk. But it does not correſpond with the ſeaſon in 1793, when the ſame diſeaſe raged in Philadelphia; for that was exceſſively dry, nor with the ſummer of 1797, which was temperate, in reſpect to heat, cold and moiſture.</p>
                  <p>Hippocrates indeed ſeems to have been aware that the ſeaſons alone were not ſufficient to account for peſtilence, for he ſpeaks of <hi>to theion,</hi> ſome divine principle in the air, by which modern
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036687_0015_100A8A9D815C53E0"/>
writers of celebrity ſuppoſe to be intended what is now called an <hi>epidemic conſtitution,</hi> reſulting from changes in the atmoſphere produced by unknown cauſes. Ariſtotle prob. 1. relates that a hot and dry ſouth wind will produce peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>The philoſophical warrior and hiſtorian, Ammianus Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus, after mentioning a plague which broke out in Amida, a city of Perſia, when beſieged by Sapor A. D. 359, from the corruption of numerous dead bodies which lay unburied in the ſtreets, proceeds to unfold the cauſes of peſtilential diſtempers, in the following manner.</p>
                  <p>"Philoſophers and eminent phyſicians have taught that peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is produced by exceſs of heat or cold, of drouth of moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whence it is that thoſe who live near wet and marſhy places are ſubject to coughs, diſeaſes of the eyes and the like. Thoſe, on the other hand, who reſide where the heat is great, are troubled with febrile complaints; and in proportion as the matter of fire is more active, drouth is more rapid in deſtroying life. Hence, during the war of ten years in Greece, this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of diſeaſe prevailed, and it was ſaid that men periſhed by the <hi>weapons of Apollo,</hi> by which was ſuppoſed to be meant, the <hi>heat of the ſun.</hi> And, according to Thucydides, the mortality among the Athenians, in the beginning of the Peloponneſian war, was occaſioned by an acute diſeaſe, which proceeded from the fervid regions of Ethiopia, and gradually extended to Attica.</p>
                  <p>"Others are of opinion that air, like water, vitiated by the effluvia of dead bodies, or ſimilar ſubſtances, is deprived of its ſalubrity; or at leaſt that a ſudden change of air will product the more ſlight complaints. Some alſo affirm that the air, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered groſs by a denſer vapor from the earth, cloſing the pores of the body and checking perſpiration, becomes fatal to the lives of ſome; for which reaſon, other animals than man, which are continually bending towards the earth, are the firſt victims to peſtilence, as Homer teſtifies, and which is proved by many examples, during the prevalence of peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>"The firſt ſpecies of plague is called <hi>pandemic,</hi> and this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts moſt ſeverely thoſe who are ſubject to exceſſive heat, in hot regions. The ſecond is denominated <hi>epidemic,</hi> which when

it rages, obſcures the ſight and excites dangerous humors. The third Lamodes, which is temporary, but produces ſudden death."</p>
                  <bibl>Lib. 19.</bibl>
                  <p>The hiſtorian has here explained the cauſes of ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, occaſioned by extremes of weather, marſh effluvia, vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted air, and the direct action of violent heat, or ſtroke of the ſun. No perſon will diſpute the juſtneſs of his remarks, for the ſame cauſes, at this day, produce the ſame effects. But the cauſes aſſigned are not adequate to all the effects, which we wiſh to explain. They do not uniformly occaſion peſtilence; and on the other hand, peſtilence ſometimes rages without the influence of thoſe cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Aetius, an eminent phyſician, about the cloſe of the 5th cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, compiled the opinions and methods of cure practiſed by the moſt celebrated of his predeceſſors. In this compilation, entitled "Tetrabiblos," chap. ix. we find the following para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph on the ſubject of Epidemic diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>"Thoſe are called popular or epidemic diſeaſes, which ſpring from a common cauſe, as bad food or water, immoderate grief or want of cuſtomary exerciſe, hunger or repletion, eſpecially when abundance ſucceeds extreme want. But the nature of the country often cauſes epidemic diſeaſes: the air we breathe being vitiated by the evaporation from putrid ſubſtances. Theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are multitudes of dead bodies after battles, marſhes or ſtagnant water in the vicinity, which emit poiſonous and fetid vapours.—This cauſe is in continual operation. And the air which ſurrounds us, always changes its temperament, when it becomes immoderately hot or cold, dry or humid. To other cauſes we are not all equally expoſed, nor at all times; but the circumambient air, when we are abroad, ſurrounds us all alike, and is inhaled with the breath.</p>
                  <p>"Sometimes the ſurrounding air, becoming unuſually humid and hot, induces a peſtilential conſtitution; and as humors, tending to putrefaction, are collected in the body by eating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome food, this air becomes the ſource of a peſtilential fever. Therefore if a perſon takes moderate exerciſe, and is
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036687_0017_100A8AA297774360"/>
temperate and regular in his diet [victu modeſto ac caſtigato] he wholly eſcapes all affections of this kind."</p>
                  <p>Such were the opinions of the phyſic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s and philoſophers of antiquity. No diſtinction appears to have been made by them, between the plague and other peſtilential diſeaſes. All were aſcribed to the ſame cauſes.</p>
                  <p>At what time the diſtinction between <hi>Peſtis</hi> and <hi>Peſtilentia</hi> was firſt made, has not occurred to my enquiries. But I find it in the writings of Proſper Alpinus, a Venetian phyſician, who wrote about the cloſe of the 16th century, and who had been, for ſome years, a practitioner in Egypt. This author maintains that peſtilent fevers are occaſioned by local cauſes, as vitiated air, and by peculiarities of ſeaſon, as extreme heat and humid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. But he aſſerts that the plague in Egypt rarely proceeds from corrupted air, and never, except after an unuſual overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nile, when that river has exceeded its common bounds. He contends that if this diſeaſe was produced by noxious exhalations from putrid and ſtagnant water, and marſhy places, it would occur every year. He therefore concludes for certain that the plague is uſually imported from Greece, Syria, Barbary, or Turkey. "Plerumque igitur id genus morbi ibi contagio ex aliis locis aſportari ſolet." The contagion of the plague is uſually imported from other countries.</p>
                  <bibl>Rerum. Egypt. vol. 2, p. 73, vol. 3, 61, and vol. 4, 299.</bibl>
                  <p>The ſame author aſſerts that the plague brought from Barbary is more malignant and of longer duration, than when brought from Greece or Syria.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck, an eminent Dutch phyſician of the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, has recorded an account of a violent plague in Nemueguen in 1636, and ſubjoined to it the beſt treatiſe on the origin of that diſeaſe, which I have been able to find, tho in one or two particulars, his ideas are very inaccurate. This author, whoſe treatiſe, I am ſurpriſed to find, is little known in this country, aſſigns three cauſes of the peſtis or true plague. Firſt, the juſt anger of heaven, provoked by the exhalations from the ſinks of our ſins and abominable deeds. Secondly, a moſt malignant, poiſonous, and to human nature, deadly peſtilent germ, [ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narium]
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036687_0018_100A8AA5A1E25100"/>
like a ſubtle fermentum or leaven, ſent from heaven, in a very ſmall quantity, diffuſing itſelf through the air like a ſubtle gas, and rendering it impure. This gas, he ſuppoſes to ſpread over many regions its numerous particles, and to impreſs on the air an infection like poiſon, which often affects not only many perſons, but almoſt the whole world.</p>
                  <p>However whimſical we may think this author's explanation of the peſtilent principle; that ſome ſuch general cauſe exiſts in the atmoſphere, at certain periods, will be rendered very probable, if not certain, by the facts hereafter to be related.</p>
                  <p>The "ſeminarium e coelo demiſſum" of Diemerbroeck ſeems to be the <hi>to theion</hi> of Hippocrates. In what the eſſence of this principle conſiſts, is not known; but there muſt be an alteration in the chymical properties of the atmoſphere to ſolve the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that attend our inquiries into the cauſe of peſtilence.— That this alteration is the effect of a poiſon, "e coelo demiſſum," is an hypotheſis unſupported by facts and wholly incredible.</p>
                  <p>The third cauſe of peſtilence, mentioned by this author, is infection.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck alſo maintains the diſtinction between <hi>peſtis</hi> and <hi>peſtilentia.</hi> The latter is ſuppoſed to proceed from foul exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, intemperate ſeaſons and the like. But the plague, he contends, cannot be occaſioned by thoſe cauſes, tho theſe may aid the ſeminarium or general cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Van Helmont, a Flemiſh writer of ſome celebrity, in the laſt century, maintains that the plague cannot be aſcribed to the "importunate and unſeaſonable changes of times, nor to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction;" that the "poiſon of the plague is a fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"The remote, crude and firſt occaſional matter of the peſtilence, is an air putrified thro' continuance, or rather a hoary putrified gas, which putrefaction of the air, hath not the 8200th part of its ſeminal body."

                  <p>Hodges, who wrote a treatiſe on the great plague in London in 1665, obſerves that the air ſuffers ſome eſſential alteration which is neceſſary to favor the propagation of peſtilence. The nitro-aerial principle, which cauſes or in vigorates vegetable and animal life, ſometimes becomes imperfect, degenerate or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, being tainted with ſomething pernicious to vitality. He calls it poiſonous, and obſerves that it proves injurious to trees and cattle, as well as to man. He ſuppoſes the corrupting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be a ſubtle aura or vapor extricated from the bowels of the earth. To this cauſe alſo he aſcribes the death of fiſh du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring periods of peſtilence. At the ſame time he contends that the infecting principle is generated in Africa or Aſia, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to other countries. The ſeat of the diſeaſe he ſuppoſes to be in the animal ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Van Swieten maintains that the cauſe of Epidemics is in the hidden qualities of the air, and inexplicable. He ſuppoſes it not impoſſible that exhalations in earthquakes may augment or leſſen the deleterious quality of the air in peſtilence.</p>

                  <p>Sydenham not only agrees with Diemerbroeck, Van Swieten, and others, in aſcribing peſtilence to occult qualities in the air, but has entered into the ſubject of explaining the peculiar ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of diſeaſes by the influence of an Epidemic conſtitution of the air. His <hi>occult qualities</hi> have been ridiculed by later phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and ſo far as his theory, in this reſpect, has been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, the ſcience of medicin has degenerated. If I miſtake not, it can be made evident, that one of the moſt important, as well as moſt difficult branches of medical ſcience, is to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the effect of the reigning conſtitution of air, on prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſeaſes, and to apply that knowledge to the cure of thoſe diſeaſes.</p>

approach. Diemerbroeck alſo maintains the latent qualities of the air to be the <hi>principal</hi> cauſe of the plague; or cauſe <hi>ſine qua non</hi>—a point which the facts to be hereafter detailed will moſt clearly demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Mead ſays, "the plague is never originally bred with us, but is always brought accidentally from abroad."</p>
                  <bibl>p. 261.</bibl>
                  <p>The ſame opinion is aſſerted moſt poſitively in James' Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dictionary, and in moſt modern publications on the ſubject. The compilers of the Encyclopedia ſay, "the plague, as <hi>is generally agreed,</hi> is never bred or propagated in Britain, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imported from abroad," eſpecially from the Levant, Leſſer Aſia or Egypt where it is very common." Such alſo was the opinion of the celebrated Cullen.</p>

                  <p>The following ſentence in Dr. Mead is very exceptionable, as it is calculated to check a ſpirit of free enquiry—a ſpirit to which mankind are greatly indebted for improvements in ſcience.</p>
                  <p>"It may be juſtly cenſured in thoſe writers that they ſhould undertake to determine the ſpecific nature of theſe ſecret chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and alterations which we have no means at all of diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," alluding to changes in the air.</p>
                  <bibl>p. 249.</bibl>
                  <p>In oppoſition to all theſe great authorities, it will probably be proved, that the plague generally, if not always originates, in the country where it exiſts as an epidemic. The common opinion of the propagation of peſtilence ſolely by infection, has had a moſt calamitous effect on medicin and on human happineſs. It has prevented the reſearches of acute modern philoſophers and phyſicians, who might have been able, by diligence and a comprehenſive view of the ſubject, to trace peſtilence to its real cauſes, and to ſuggeſt the true means of avoiding this terrible ſcourge.</p>
                  <p>Thompſon who travelled in Egypt about the year 1734, and whoſe account of that country has not been mended by modern travellers, obſerves, "The coming and going of the plague are two things not eaſily to be accounted for, notwithſtanding we
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036687_0022_100A8AB054177690"/>
are aſſured of the facts in a moſt unqueſtionable manner. That the infection is propagated in the air, and thereby tranſferred from place to place, ſeems to be a matter out of diſpute; but how it is generated therein, we are much at a loſs to determine." He proceeds to ſtate, like many others, "that the plague is generally brought into Egypt from Conſtantinople or by Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans from the ſouthern countries." And on the whole he thinks it rarely generated in that country.</p>

                  <p>In the Monthly Review vol. 33, there is an account of the plague in Conſtantinople, by Dr. Mackenzie, in which are ſome paſſages worthy of notice. After aſſerting his opinion that this diſtemper can be communicated only by the touch or near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, he adds, "that both here and at Smyrna, the plague breaks out, in ſome years, when it is not poſſible to trace whence it is conveyed." He ſuppoſes the diſeaſe to proceed from "venomous moleculae lodged in wool, cotton, hair, leather and ſkins," in houſes not well cleanſed after peſtilence; but that the plague from this ſource is not ſo fatal as when it comes from abroad. The air he thinks no otherwiſe concerned in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the diſeaſe, than as "a vehicle to convey the venomous particles from one body to another."</p>
                  <p>Dr. Chandler, in his account of a plague in Smyrna, has near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame idea, as Mackenzie, with reſpect to the origin of the diſeaſe. He ſays "the plague might perhaps be truly defined, a diſeaſe ariſing from certain animalculae, probably inviſible, which burrow and form their nidus in the human body. Theſe whether generated in Egypt or elſewhere, ſubſiſt always in ſome places ſuited to their nature. <hi>They are imported almoſt annually into Smyrna,</hi> and this ſpecies is commonly deſtroyed by intenſe heat. They are leaſt fatal at the beginning and latter end of the ſeaſon. If they arrive early in the ſpring, they are weak; but gather ſtrength, multiply and then periſh. The pores of the ſkin, opened by the weather, readily admit them."</p>
                  <p>Baron de Tott in his memoirs obſerves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The reſearches I have carefully made concerning the plague, which I once believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to originate in Egypt, have convinced me, that it would not be ſo much as known there, were not the ſeeds of it conveyed

thither by the commercial intercourſe between Conſtantinople and Alexandria. It is in this laſt city that it always begins to appear. It rarely reaches Cairo, though no precaution is taken to prevent it; and when it does, it is preſently extirpated by the heats, and prevented from arriving as far as the Said. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe well known that the penetrating dews, which fall in Egypt about midſummer, deſtroy, even in Alexandria, all remains of this diſtemper."</p>

                  <p>In vol. 1, p. 38 he ſays, "that the reſearches into the nature of this diſtemper have only produced opinions which are ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory or unſupported by facts."—"There is no difficulty with reſpect to the cauſes which preſerve and propagate it.

                  <p>Du Pauw, in his Philoſophical Diſſertations on the Egyptians and Chineſe, ſpeaks of the plague as a diſeaſe of Egypt; and ſuppoſes the plague at Vienna in 1680, to have been imported from that country.—"Egypt is the hot-bed of the plague—this diſorder is not produced by famin—by exact annotations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued during twenty-eight years, we find that it raged five times, without being preceded by any ſcarcity of food, and contrary to what I once ſuſpected, unreſtricted to a periodical courſe."</p>

                  <p>Savary alledges, in oppoſition to the laſt mentioned author, that the peſtilence is <hi>not</hi> native in Egypt, and that he conſulted Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and phyſicians who had lived there 20 years, who <hi>informed</hi> him that the plague was brought thither by the Turks.

                  <p>Dr. Alexander Ruſſel has given an account of the plague in Aleppo in 1742 and 3, and endeavored to aſcertain from what quarter the diſeaſe originated and invaded that city.

It was aſſerted that the great plague of 1719 came from the northward; but as this fact does not ſuit his theory, he, like
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036687_0024_100A8AB473118068"/>
Dr. Mead, in the caſe before mentioned, gives no credit to the aſſertion, but adheres to his opinion that all plagues originate in Egypt.—At the ſame time he is puzzled to trace the diſeaſe, in any inſtance, to that country.</p>

                  <p>Dr. Patrick Ruſſel has publiſhed a quarto volume on the plague of Aleppo in 1760, and the ſubject of quarantine. In this work, he has preſerved a number of important facts, but without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſubject ſufficiently to apply them to uſeful purpoſes. All his theory and practical remarks are founded on the vulgar ſuppoſition of the origin of that diſeaſe in one or two cities only, and its propagation by ſpecific contagion—a ſuppoſition totally unfounded; his treatiſe of courſe will be found of little value, in this reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Volney. with all his philoſophy and ſeveral months reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Egypt, furniſhes no additional light, on the ſubject of the origin of peſtilence. He ſays, "ſome perſons have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to eſtabliſh an opinion, that the plague originates in Egypt; but this ſuppoſition, <hi>founded on vague prejudices,</hi> ſeems to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by facts." This is an extraordinary aſſertion for a man who has the character of a philoſopher. And on what author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity does it reſt? Simply on the declaration of European Merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants who have been ſettled for many years at Alexandria, and of the Egyptians, who ſay that the diſeaſe firſt appears in Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, and that it is invariably preceded by an arrival from Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na or Conſtantinople. Therefore this philoſopher concludes, "that the diſeaſe certainly originates from Conſtantinople, where it is perpetuated by the abſurd negligence of the Turks, who publicly ſell the effects of perſons who die of that diſtemper." Here we have another great man aſcribing this vaſt effect, an epidemic peſtilence, to ſo trifling a cauſe, as infection preſerved in furs, woolens, and old clothes!</p>
                  <p>What is ſtill more aſtoniſhing, the ſame author adopts the ideas of the Egyptians, which Proſper Alpinus had adopted before him and which he has evidently copied from Alpinus, that a plague coming from one country is leſs malignant than when it comes from another, as tho there could be a difference in the <hi>ſpecific</hi> contagion of the diſeaſe, when produced in different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036687_0025_100A8AB628B81A50"/>
Volney ſays "when brought from the Archipelago, or even from Damietta, into the harbours of Latakia, Saide or Acre, it <hi>will not ſpread;</hi> it rather chuſes preliminary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and a more complex route; but when it paſſes directly from Cairo to Damaſcus, all Syria is ſure to be infected."</p>
                  <bibl>Travels in Egypt and Syria vol. 1. 253. et ſeq.</bibl>
                  <p>It is really ſurpriſing that, if the fact is well evidenced, that a plague proceeding from one country is more malignant than one proceeding from another, men of extenſive erudition and obſervation ſhould not undertake to aſſign ſome rational cauſe for the phenomenon, rather than to propagate the vulgar tales and opinions of the Egyptians.</p>
                  <p>From this lengthy ſtatement of opinions in regard to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and cauſes of peſtilence; opinions weak, contradictory, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd or inaccurate, what concluſion ſhall be drawn. This, moſt evidently, that the <hi>ſubject is not underſtood.</hi> Perhaps it never will be underſtood. But ſurely a ſubject ſo intereſting to the life and happineſs of man, deſerves moſt critical and laborious enquiry. A ſubject which concerns the lives of millions of the human race ought not to be abandoned by the man of ſcience, until every effort to find the truth ſhall have been exhauſted. Yet ſtrange as it may appear, even a hiſtory of peſtilence that all devouring ſcourge which has ſwept away a large portion of the human race in every age, is yet a deſideratum in our libraries.</p>
                  <p>To ſupply in part this defect, and to ſtimulate further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches into the origin of this frequent and formidable calamity, I will recite ſuch hiſtorical accounts of the plague, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect examination of authors has enabled me to collect. And as the moſt accurate obſervers of the operations of nature, have ſuggeſted the probability that peſtilential epidemics are cauſed by ſome occult qualities in the air, or by vapor from the internal parts of the earth, or by planetary influence, it is abſolutely neceſſary to enquire how far ſuch ſuggeſtions are ſupported by facts. For this purpoſe, I ſhall note, as I proceed, any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary occurrence or phenomena in the phyſical world, as earthquakes, eruptions of volcanoes, appearance of comets, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent tempeſts, unuſual ſeaſons, and other ſingular events and circumſtances, which may appear to be connected with peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036687_0026_100A8AB7EC9F4F30"/>
either as cauſe or effect, or as the effect of a common cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The reſult of this proceſs will probably be a refutation of ſome of the foregoing opinions, and the eſtabliſhment of ſuch as are more rational and philoſophical.</p>
                  <p>It is proper however to premiſe, that this inveſtigation, which has been purſued but a few months only, amidſt other occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, has been ſubjected to inconveniences peculiar to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States. No man can find in this country <hi>all</hi> the books ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a complete examination of a hiſtorical or ſcientific ſubject. The public libraries in New-York and New-Haven, tho very valuable, are deficient. Thoſe of Harvard College and Philadelphia, are more extenſive, but incomplete. I have examined them all, tho in ſome of them I could ſpend but little time; yet in none of them could I find all the authorities which it was my wiſh and intention to conſult.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be premiſed, that I have, as far as it could be done, reſorted to original hiſtorians for my facts and authorities. This is certainly the only ſafe method for a compiler; but in the United States, it cannot be purſued with complete ſucceſs, for want of the original writers of the local hiſtories of countries. Moſt of the Greek and Roman authors are to be obtained in our public or private libraries; but ſome of the beſt hiſtorians of Italy, Germany, the Baltic nations and Spain, who have lived within the laſt four or five centuries, are not to be found; others are in the original languages, which I do not underſtand.</p>
                  <p>As to the modern hiſtorical compilations in my native lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, they are almoſt uſeleſs on this ſubject. The moſt able and celebrated of them, Hume, Robertſon, Smollet, Rapin and Gibbon, have paſſed over moſt of the plagues which have deſolated cities and countries, without notice, or with ſome general remarks which afford little light on the ſubject of their origin.</p>
                  <p>Moſt modern writers appear to think every thing beneath their notice, except war and political intrigues. They detail, with diſguſting minuteneſs, whatever relates to the definition or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of mankind by the ambition of princes and demagogues;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:036687_0027_100A8ABB9F3C1BE8"/>
while they omit or ſlightly mention whatever regards the civil and domeſtic economy, the private manners and habits, the arts, the health, and the ſocial happineſs of nations. To this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, Dr. Henry's Hiſtory of England, is an exception.</p>
                  <p>Nor have modern travellers furniſhed us with many valuable materials to ſupply the defects of our hiſtories. They paſs from country to country; examine and deſcribe a few external ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſuch as cities, buildings, paintings and ſtatues, but leave more uſeful ſubjects unexamined, and return home with a book of vulgar tales and errors.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to uſeful hiſtory, the ancient authors have the preference over the modern. Modern compilers appear to have written for fame or for money, rather than for the ſake of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding and diffuſing truth. Hence they have principally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to thoſe animated periods of the world, which were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for great achievments; or thoſe prominent events, a deſcription of which would intereſt the paſſions of their readers: Or they have ſelected for deſcription ſuch parts of the hiſtory of nations as would enable them to adorn their works with an elevated ſtyle; omitting a multitude of ſubordinate facts, as below the dignity of hiſtory. Others appear to have undertaken hiſtorical compilation, ſolely or principally to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſome preconceived ſyſtem of government or religion; and have ſtudied to bend the evidence of facts, to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe obſervations have ariſen out of my enquiries, relative to peſtilential diſeaſes. I have diſcovered that many of the hiſtories or rather abridgements and compilations which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the only authorities conſulted by American readers in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, are very incomplete; and no man who relies on them only, and neglects original writers, can acquire an accurate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive knowledge of hiſtory.</p>

                  <p>IT is an agreed point that the five books of Moſes are the moſt ancient authentic hiſtory now extant. In the very threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of this genuine hiſtory, we meet with accounts of the plague in Egypt. In the fifth chapter of Exodus, the peſtilence is mentioned as a formidable calamity.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable, that throughout the hiſtory of the Jews, and in the prophets, <hi>peſtilence, famin</hi> and <hi>the ſword</hi> are often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in connection with each other, and deſcribed as the moſt dreadful calamities that can befal mankind. It will probably appear that famin and peſtilential diſeaſes do at times recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally produce each other, and that war not unfrequently occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions both. But there is ground to believe that famin and peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence are uſually the effects of one common cauſe. In the Bible, as in other ancient writings, no diſtinction is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween general peſtilence which ſpreads over whole countries, and thoſe autumnal epidemics, which are evidently produced by powerful local cauſes. There are however many paſſages in ſcripture that corroborate the principles reſpecting peſtilence, which are ſtill obſerved, and which doubtleſs depend on eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed laws of nature.</p>
                  <p>When David was ſummoned to receive his puniſhment for numbering the children of Iſrael, he was permitted to elect one of the three calamities, famin, the ſword or peſtilence. For a pious reaſon, he preferred peſtilence, and ſeventy thouſand of his ſubjects periſhed.</p>
                  <bibl>2 Sam. xxiv.</bibl>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:036687_0029_100A8ABF01799428"/>The prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, in their denunciations, ſpeak often of theſe three judgments, and in a way that authorizes the opinion, that they conſidered them all to be cloſely connected. It is however remarkable that peſtilence is every where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as the peculiar ſcourge of <hi>cities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the 21ſt chapter of Jeremiah, the ſiege of Jeruſalem is foretold. "I will ſmite the inhabitants of this <hi>city,</hi> both man and beaſt; they ſhall die with a great peſtilence. He that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this <hi>city</hi> ſhall die by the ſword, by the famin and by the peſtilence; but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans that beſiege you, <hi>he ſhall live,</hi> and his life ſhall be to him for a prey."</p>
                  <p>Ezekiel v. 12. declares that a <hi>third part</hi> of the inhabitants of Jeruſalem ſhall die by peſtilence. This is a proportion which is not uncommon, in violent plagues. In the ſeventh chapter, the ſame prophet ſays, "The ſword is <hi>without,</hi> and the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and famin <hi>within</hi>; he that is in the field, ſhall die with the ſword; and he that is in the <hi>city,</hi> famin and peſtilence ſhall devour him."</p>
                  <p>Another paſſage in the ſame prophet deſerves notice. Chap. xxxiii, it is ſaid, "Thus ſaith the Lord, as I live, ſurely they that are in the waſtes ſhall fall by the ſword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beaſts to be devoured, and they that be in the <hi>forts</hi> and the <hi>caves</hi> ſhall die of the peſtilence."</p>
                  <p>In theſe paſſages, we have proof that in the time of theſe prophets, it was conſidered as a well known fact, that peſtilential diſeaſes are the effect of crouded propulation, raging peculiarly in <hi>cities, forts</hi> and other confined places. No evidence appears, in theſe early records, that the ancients, who lived in countries ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to plague, and near to Egypt, had any idea of the convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the diſtemper from place to place by infection. It was conſidered as a judgment of heaven; and piety ſtill recognizes this idea; to which, in a moral and religious view, there can be no objection. But philoſophy endeavors to trace the hand of heaven through the medium of ſecond cauſes; and the facts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded

of peſtilence in ſcripture, lend their aid to accompliſh the object.</p>
                  <p>In 1 Samuel v. and vi. we have an account of the peſtilence among the Philiſtines, inflicted on them as a puniſhment for the king the ark from the Jews, in which fifty thouſand of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Beth ſhemeſh periſhed. This plague is called <hi>eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> and a <hi>deadly deſtruction.</hi> This paſſage is noted on account of the ſpecification of the time of the year, when the diſeaſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. It is ſaid, the ark was in the country of the Philiſtince <hi>ſeven months,</hi> and was returned, during wheat-harveſt, ſoon after which it is underſtood, the plague ceaſed. Now wheat harveſt, in Syria, is in May; and it may be ſuppoſed, the peſtilence was moſt violent in the period next preceding that time, viz. April, or during the month of May, for it was the ſeverity of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which induced them to ſend back the ark.—This account correſponds with the modern courſe of peſtilence in that country. It appears in February or March, increaſes till May or June, then gradually diſappears.</p>
                  <bibl>See A. Ruſſel. Hiſt. of Aleppo. P. Ruſſel on the plague at Aleppo.</bibl>
                  <p>In this caſe, modern facts confirm the accuracy of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-hiſtory; at the ſame time, they eſtabliſh the identity of the diſeaſe with modern plague, and the uniformity in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the laws of nature. They prove further that the climate of that country has ſuffered no material alteration.</p>
                  <p>In the eleventh chapter of Numbers, we have an account of a plague among the Iſraelites, occaſioned by their eating great quantities of the fleſh of quails, after being ſome time deſtitute of animal food—an obvious effect in the hot climates of Egypt and Arabia.</p>
                  <p>The ſcripture-hiſtory alſo furniſhes us with ample proof that Egypt was, in early times, the nurſery of plague—known and conſidered as ſuch, centuries before the foundation of Smyrna, Conſtantinople, or other large cities in Greece or Aſia Minor.</p>
                  <p>In Deuteronomy xxviii. the Iſraelites are warned againſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to the laws of Moſes, and in caſe of diſregarding them, are threatened with the diſeaſes of Egypt, the botch, the emerods and the ſcab. Theſe are ſtill prevailing diſorders in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036687_0031_100A8AC5D8C27870"/>
that country under the names of leproſy, elephantiaſis, plague, &amp;c. In verſe 60 of the ſame chapter, it is denounced, "More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he ſhall bring upon thee <hi>all the diſeaſes of Egypt,</hi> of which thou waſt afraid."</p>
                  <p>Amos lv. 10. "I have ſent among you the <hi>peſtilence,</hi> after <hi>the manner of Egypt.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Theſe authorities of high antiquity leave no room for doubt or controverſy, on the queſtion, whether Egypt originates the plague. The evidence is deciſive againſt thoſe modern ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial philoſophers, who hold in contempt the moſt authentic an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtory, becauſe it has claims to inſpiration. Yet infidels, if they were not too wiſe to read, examin and be informed, might be convinced of the authenticity of the ſcripture hiſtory, by comparing the facts related, with the preſent ſtate of the world. The preſent endemical and other diſeaſes which often occur in Egypt, anſwer ſo exactly to the deſcription given of them in the books of Moſes, as to leave no room to queſtion the genuineneſs of thoſe books. It was the peculiar climate of Egypt, and the uſual prevalence of ſcorbutic and malignant complaints, in that country, which occaſioned all the minute injunctions of Moſes, in regard to waſhing, cleanſing and purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations. The ſame or ſimilar regulations were enjoined by the laws of Egypt.<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been controverted whether Moſes borrowed his ſyſtem of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification from the inſtitutions which he found in Egypt; or whether the Egyptians borrowed the idea from the laws of Moſes. Nothing can be more idle than ſuch a diſpute. The experience of men would very readily ſuggeſt the neceſſity and utility of great cleanlineſs, to preſerve health in the climate of Egypt. The cuſtom of circumciſion was eſtabliſhed among the Egyptians, as well as among the Iſraelites; and Herodotus who viſited Egypt to collect facts, expreſsly declares that the "Egyptians circumciſed their children for the ſake of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs." —There is not the leaſt reaſon to ſuppoſe that the Egyptians borrowed this cuſtom, or others reſpecting cleanlineſs, from the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites. Nor does it vary the queſtion, that the laws of Moſes were the commands of God. Divine commands have rarely introduced a new principle of right and wrong. Moſt of them are injunctions on man to conform to principles of moral fitneſs or utility, which exiſted <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior to the commands.</hi> They <hi>unfold</hi> to human view, and <hi>enforce</hi> the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of thoſe principles; but do not <hi>create</hi> them. They add the ſtrong authority of <hi>poſitive,</hi> to the feebler authority of <hi>implied</hi> divine will; and are thus of the higheſt importance to mankind.</note>

                              <p>This evidently alludes to the received opinion among the ancients, that comets have an influence in producing peſtilence. In the courſe of this work, we ſhall have ſome grounds to determin which is moſt correct, this opinion of antiquity, or that of the moderns who hold it in contempt.</p>
                              <p>It is to be obſerved that the idea of comets producing diſeaſes, is not in Homer, in the paſſage from which theſe lines are taken, but is a licence of the tranſlator, Mr. Pope, and the ſenſe and almoſt the words, are borrowed from Milton. Book 2. l. 710.</p>

                              <p>It is further remarkable that, in the peſtilential period to which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer here alludes, which happened during the ſiege of Troy, Etna was in a ſtate of eruption; or rather at the cloſe of the period: For Eneas, when driven from Troy, ſailed with his fellow citizens to Sicily, but was frightened away by a violent exploſion of Etna.

                  <p>The circumſtances to be noted in the foregoing extracts, are, firſt that the peſtilence among cattle preceded that among men. This is a common fact, but not always the caſe. Secondly, that heat and moiſture, with a ſouth wind were productive of peſtilential diſeaſes. Thirdly, that ſuch diſeaſes raged in Greece during the autumnal ſeaſon, and were aſcribed to the influence of Syrius, or the dog-ſtar.</p>
                  <p>We read of a terrible peſtilence in the iſland of Aegina, to the ſouthward of Athens, in the reign of Aeacus, grandfather of Achilles, about ſixty years before the Trojan war; a plague which depopulated the iſland. Of this calamity, Ovid has given a moſt affecting account Metam. lib. 7. 523. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the earth as covered with clouds, darkneſs and ſuffocating heat; the ſouth wind blowing for four months, the lakes and fountains being infected, and the earth overſpread with poiſonous ſerpents. The diſeaſe firſt invaded dogs, birds, ſheep and ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; then mankind. Death was ſudden; and the ſtreets loaded with dead carcaſes. The ſymptoms began with heat in the bowels, ſluſhings of the face, difficulty of breathing, &amp;c.

                  <p>Rome, on the other hand, is ſituated in a level country, on the banks of a river, and not far from extenſive marſhes. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of powerful local cauſes, this city felt every derangement of the atmoſphere, by intemperate ſeaſons, or other cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt plague in Rome happened about the 16th year from its foundation, ſoon after the murder of Tatius, and in time of peace. "It killed inſtantly without any previous ſickneſs. Even trees and cattle were not exempt from the malignity of its influence; but all nature lay one deſolate and abandoned waſte. It was even ſaid to rain blood." This was 738 years before the Chriſtian era.</p>

                  <p>This peſtilence muſt have been of the moſt malignant kind, and by the effect on cattle and trees, it was obviouſly during a peſtilential ſtate of the atmoſphere, when there was a defect in the powers of vegetable as well as animal life—many ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will occur in the courſe of this hiſtory. It is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that Rome was then in its infant ſtate, containing few people, and few of the artificial cauſes of diſeaſe.

                  <p>In the reign of Numa Pompilius A. R. 46, Italy was afflicted with ſevere peſtilence; on which occaſion Numa inſtituted the Salii, twelve dancers who had the care of the brazen target, which was ſuppoſed to deſcend from heaven into the hands of

                  <p>Another plague attacked Rome in the reign of Tullius Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilius, about the year 110 or 112, and B. C. about 640. No important particulars are related, except that the ſickneſs relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the martial ſpirit of the citizens.

C. 477. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance is ſtrong evidence that the chronology is not quite correct. The eruption took place unqueſtionably during the peſtilential period, to which this plague in Rome belonged. It might not have been the very year of the plague in Rome, but probably was not ſo diſtant as four years. To which event, the plague or the eruption, a wrong era is aſſigned, I ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin. The early hiſtory of Rome, from the deſtruction of the ancient records, by the burning of the city, when taken by the Gauls under Brennus, in the year 365, is ſubject to great uncertainty, and authors do not agree on the chronology of that part of the Roman ſtory.</p>
                  <p>☞ Since writing the foregoing remarks, I have diſcovered a fact which may ſerve to aid us in fixing the period of the events abovementioned. In the courſe of this work it will be proved beyond doubt, that the approach of comets to our ſyſtem, has a prodigious influence on the elements of this globe. At preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent I ſhall aſſume the fact, that the eruption of Etna above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, was nearly cotemporary with the appearance of a comet, during this period of peſtilence. In looking into Pliny's Natural Hiſtory, lib. 2. ca. 25, I find that a comet was viſible, at the time of the battle of Salamis. Speaking of the different ſpecies of comets he ſays "Ceratias Cornus ſpeciem habet, qualis fecit cum Graecia apud Salamina depugnavit." "A comet in the figure of a javelin, like that which appeared when Greece fought at Salamis." This battle is fixed by authors in the year B. C. 480, and conſequently in the year of Rome, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon chronology 274. It appears to be a general law of nature that the approach of comets to this earth, calls into action the ſubterranean fire, and volcanoes diſcharge their contents, during or within a few months of the appearance of comets. We may ſafely conclude therefore that the eruption was within a year

or two of the battle of Salamis. This is not certain, but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and I am inclined therefore to believe that Hook and others have placed the plague in Rome three or four years too late, or that the eruption is placed too early.<note n="†" place="bottom">Brydone mentions an eruption in the 77th Olympiad, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the years of Rome from 282 to 285 incluſive, which it doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſame abovementioned.</note>

                  <p>The army of Xerxes, retreating into Aſia, after the loſs of the engagement near Salamis, ſuffered extremely by peſtilential diſeaſes. And it will hereafter appear that during periods when the peſtilential ſtate of air is evidenced by the exiſtence of plague in <hi>cities,</hi> armies in the field and ſeamen on the ocean are much more ſubject to epidemic complaints, than at other times.</p>
                  <p>The land forces which Xerxes left behind him under Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, fell a prey to famin and peſtilence. The highways were ſtrewed with dead bodies, and wild fowls and beaſts devoured them.</p>
                  <p>The ſame period was diſtinguiſhed by tempeſts and inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions —the conſtant attendants on comets. A violent ſtorm had deſtroyed the famous bridge built by the great monarch over the Helleſpont, before he returned from Greece; and while the troops under Mardonius were beſieging Potidea, an inundation of the ſea broke into their trenches, drowned ſome ſoldiers, and compelled them to raiſe the ſiege.</p>
                  <bibl>Herodotus lib. 8. 115, 129. Juſtin lib. 2. cap. 13.</bibl>
                  <p>Theſe great phenomena, without any hiſtorical account, would make it nearly certain that a comet appeared at that time, and the peſtilence undoubtedly happened within a ſhort period of its approach.</p>
                  <p>A more terrible peſtilence invaded the Roman city and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, in the year 290, and B. C. 464. Several facts in regard to it, deſerve particular notice. "Grave tempus et forte annus peſtilens erat urbi, agriſque, nec hominibus magis, quam pecori; et auxere vim morbi, tenore pupulationis, pecoribus agreſtibuſque, in urbem acceptis.

aeſtu ac vigiliis angebat, miniſteriaque in vicem ac contagio ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa vulgabant morbos."</p>
                  <bibl>Livy. lib. 3. 6. Dion Hal. lib. 10.</bibl>
                  <p>"This was an unhealthy time and a peſtilent year in town and country, affecting equally men and cattle; and the diſeaſe was augmented by crouds of countrymen and herds of cattle, which were received within the walls of the city, for fear of being plundered or deſtroyed [by the Latins and Hernici, who then ravaged the country.] That collection of all kinds of animals in the city, and the unuſual ſtench occaſioned by them, ſeverely affected both the citizens and the country people, crouded into cloſe buildings, depreſſed by heat and watching; and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue and the contagion ſpread the ſickneſs into every quarter."</p>
                  <p>This is Livy's repreſentation. Dionyſius Hallicarnaſſus men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that the diſeaſe ſeized <hi>ſtuds</hi> of mares, <hi>herds</hi> of oxen, and <hi>flocks</hi> of goats and ſheep; by which expreſſions we are perhaps to underſtand, that the diſtemper either did not ſeize thoſe animals, except in collections, or was remarkably fatal to them in nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bodies—an idea warranted by modern facts. It is generally true of cattle as of men, that peſtilential diſeaſes are moſt deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, where many are collected together; not only by reaſon of infection from the diſeaſed, but by the diminution of the vital principle of the air by reſpiration and perſpiration.</p>
                  <p>Oroſius lib. 2. 12. adds other circumſtances. He ſays there was a ſhort ſuſpenſion of war, when a grievous peſtilence, which never failed to compel the Romans to a truce, or to interrupt it, if made, raged violently through all the city. Many of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians were victims, but it was moſt fatal to the poor.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtated that this peſtilence began about the calends of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember and raged in city and country. By country, <hi>agris,</hi> the Roman writers meant the ancient Latium, the modern Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagna di Roma, which was naturally unhealthy; tho, in the flouriſhing ages of Rome, extremely populous.</p>
                  <p>That the Roman territory ſhould be ſubject to autumnal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, is not at all ſurpriſing. At the port of the Tyber there were unwholeſome marſhes, called by Tacitus, Annals 15. 43. "Oſtienſes paludes." The ſhore to the ſouthward, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Campania, is called by the ſame hiſtorian, "ſqualente
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036687_0039_100A8AD9E67B6CD8"/>
littore." To the ſouthward of Campania were and ſtill are the extenſive marſhes, called "paludes pomptinae," which are ſo noxious as to create diſeaſe in a ſingle night, and which have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Appian way in modern times to be neglected, and the road to Naples to be carried round the marſhes on the eaſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>In the epitome of the 46th book of Livy, which book is among thoſe which are loſt, I find it related that the Pontine Marſhes were drained or dyked [ſiccatae] and converted into cultivable land, by the Conſul Cornelius Cethegus, about the year of Rome 572. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were convinced that the marſhes were very unwholeſome, and they took incredible pains to render their city and territory healthful, by draining off all ſtagnant waters.</p>
                        <p>It is much to be regretted that we have not this book of Livy, to give us further information in what manner the draining of the marſhes was effected. It is conſidered by the moderns as impracticable.</p>
                        <p>The opinion of the ancients as to the unhealthfulneſs of Rome may be underſtood from the following Tetraſtichon, which is preſerved by Baronius.</p>
                        <lg>
                           <l>"Roma vorax hominum, domat ardua colla virorum;</l>

                        </lg>
                        <p>The brief tranſlation of which is "Rome ſubdues men by the ſword, and kills them with fevers."</p>
                        <p>Horace book 2. ode 29. gives to the Tyber, the epithet <hi>udus,</hi> wet or marſhy.</p>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The territory next to the city of Rome is deſcribed by Livy, b. 7. 38. in theſe words "in peſtilente atque arido circa urbem ſolo"—a dry plain, but indented with lakes, bordered with marſhes, and ſubject to be overflowed by every uncommon riſe of the Tyber, or by ſtreams from the diſtant hills. Many epidemic diſeaſes have been diſtinctly traced to ſtagnant waters on this plain, after an inundation.</p>
                  <p>Avernus, a lake of Campania, near Baiae, emitted ſuch a poiſonous vapor, that no birds would frequent its banks, and the ancients, in their flights of fancy called it, the road to Hell.</p>
                  <p>It was this ſituation of Rome which gave riſe to the Cloacae, immenſe ſewers or drains, which penetrated the city and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood —Vaſt works intended to drain off the ſtagnant waters; and while theſe were preſerved in good repair, the city was obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly more healthy.</p>
                  <p>This plague in the year 290 proved fatal to both of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls Servilius and Aebutius, to many illuſtrious Romans, and to a countleſs number of the Plebeians. The Senate and people, in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036687_0040_100A8ADC6DC51A20"/>
part had rccourſe to prayers and ſupplications, the temples were filled with men, women and children, aſking forgiveneſs and favor of heaven.</p>
                  <p>This violent plague was followed, anno Urb. Con. 292 by a violent earthquake. "Terra ingenti concuſſa motu eſt," ſays Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, lib. 3. ca. 10. He expreſsly mentions this to have been in the conſulate of P. Volumnius and Serv. Sulpicius, which was the ſecond Conſulate after the peſtilence. An eruption of Etna is mentioned in the tables under the year of Rome 288, two years before the peſtilence and four years before the earthquake. But there is probably a ſmall variation in the chronology. The earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake was probably at the time of the eruption, eſpecially as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy mentions, that in the ſame year, "Coelum ardere viſum," the heavens appeared to be in a flame.</p>
                  <p>Functius places theſe events one year later.</p>
                  <p>By this earthquake Locris, on the gulf of Corinth, was rent from the main land and turned into an iſland. Afterwards Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris was deſtroyed by another earthquake.</p>
                  <p>Severe drouth marked this period.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 300 according to Livy and the common chronology and B. C. 454, another terrible peſtilence invaded Rome. The country was deſolated, and the citizens were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted with continual burials. "Urbs aſſiduis exhauſta funer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ibus." Famin accompanied this calamity, and cattle were vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims, as well as men. This plague took place in time of peace —"ab hoſte otium fuit," and in the abſence of the ambaſſadors who were ſent to Athens to collect the laws of Solon and the Grecian inſtitutions.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy b. 3. 32.</bibl>
                  <p>With this period correſponds an eruption of Etna, which au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors place in the year of Rome 304; of courſe, it was at the cloſe of the peſtilential period.</p>
                  <p>In the year 315 of Rome and B. C. 439, according to Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Diaconus, tremendous earthquakes ſhook Italy at intervals for a whole year, ſo that "aſſiduis Roma, nuntiis fataga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reter," Rome was fatigued with meſſengers who were continually arriving with news of towns and villages demoliſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="unknown:036687_0041_100A8ADF15E0E420"/>The chronology of P. Diaconus rarely agrees with that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received. The earthquakes here mentioned probably uſhered in the long and formidable calamity which was to follow —and were probably cotemporary with the beginning of the plague next to be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 317, and B. C. 437 commenced a peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential ſtate that afflicted Rome for five years, or five ſeaſons ſucceſſively. The hiſtorian relates that the firſt year "a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence invaded the people," and as the diſeaſe increaſed, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies alarmed them and frequent earthquakes overturned houſes in the country. The next year the diſeaſe was more mortal: "peſtilentior inde annus." In 320, the diſeaſe was ſo fatal as to ſuſpend all ordinary concerns. The people reſorted to their prayers, and the Sybilline books were conſulted and obeyed, to appeaſe the Gods and avert the plague from the people. For fear of famin, corn was purchaſed in Etruria, the Pontine ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory and in Sicily. The mortality extended alſo to cattle. In 321, the diſeaſe was mitigated and afterwards ſubſided.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy b. 4. 21, 25.</bibl>
                  <p>This is the firſt inſtance, in which I am able to trace diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>progreſſion</hi> in the malignancy of the plague. That this is an important fact, in all plagues, will hereafter appear. But on this point, ancient hiſtory affords very ſcanty materials. This was a period of univerſal peſtilence for many years, and was marked with all the great phenomena of nature. The laſt year of the plague in Rome 321, correſponds with the year B. C. 433, two years before the plague of Athens. In the year of Rome 325, according to Hook, there was a moſt grievous famin, occaſioned by a ſevere drouth in all the Roman territory. "Siccitas eo anno plurimum laboratum eſt; nec caeleſtes modo defuerunt aquae, ſed terra quoque, ingenito humore egens, vix ad perrennes ſubfecit amnes." By this, we are led to believe, that the drouth was not ſolely cauſed by a want of rain, but by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual defect of ſubterranean ſprings and moiſture. The expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, "ingenito humore egens," contraſted with the uſual ſource of water, rain, evidently carries with it an idea that the evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the earth was <hi>unuſual;</hi> and this may eaſily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, by the violent action of internal heat or electricity
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036687_0042_100A8AE2E7AA3490"/>
which diſtinguiſhed this peſtilential period, and was evidenced by tremendous and univerſal earthquakes, and a great eruption of Etna.</p>
                  <p>The drouth in Rome was extreme—multitudes of cattle thronged round the arid fountains, and periſhed with thirſt. Diſeaſes followed, firſt invading cattle, and the lower claſſes of people and the countrymen, then extending to the city.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy b. 4. 30.</bibl>
                  <p>Thucydides relates b. 1 and 3, that earthquakes affected the largeſt part of the globe, and ſhook it with the utmoſt violence. In many places, there was ſevere drouth and a ſubſequent famin. In ſome places, the earthquakes produced alarming inundations of the ſea; as in Euboea and Atalanta—the Prytaneum, or town-houſe in Athens, the fortifications and ſome dwelling-houſes were demoliſhed. Theſe events were in the fifth and ſixth years of the Peloponneſian war, anſwering to 427 and 426 B. C. and conſequently were at the cloſe, or ſubſequent to the peſtilence. About the ſame time there was a violent eruption of Etna; ſuch as had not been known for fifty years preceding. This period was alſo marked by the approach of a comet, but I am not clear that it was in the year B. C. 431, as ſtated by Dr. Prieſtley in his Lectures on Hiſtory. The drouth was probably within a few months of the appearance of the comet, according to numerous obſervations in late periods of the world: By which it would ſeem to be a law of the phyſical ſyſtem, that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding, during</hi> and <hi>following</hi> the approach of thoſe erratic bodies, this earth is affected alternately with great rains and ſnows, drouth, violent tempeſts, high tides and earthquakes: Many instances will hereafter occur.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>We are ſometimes embarraſſed with the differences in the chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology of different authors. But we have, in this place, data that will fix certain points.</p>
                        <p>From the uniform operations of nature, there can be very little doubt, that all the great events of the phyſical world, in this period, happened within twelve or eighteen months of each other. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme drouth in Italy and Greece, mentioned by Livy and Thucydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, unqueſtionably occurred, at both places, in the ſame year. Livy places this under the conſulſhip of A. Cornelius Coſſus and T. Quincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Pennus, which Hook arranges under the 325th year of Rome, and Lempriere, under the 327th.</p>
                        <p>Now Thucydides expreſsly relates, that the great earthquake which injured Athens, and produced the inundations in the Corinthian Gulf and the Sea of Euboea, rending Atalanta from the main land, and ſwallowing up a town in Euboea, happened in the ſpring or ſummer of the ſixth year of the Peloponneſian war. This war commenced in the ſecond or third year of the eighty-ſeventh Olympiad, correſponding with the years of Rome 323 or 324. The ſixth year then will be the 328th or 329th year of Rome. Theſe data bring the drouth in Rome to one of thoſe years; at leaſt they will not admit of its being placed earlier than the year 327, the year preceding the earthquake. It is probable therefore that Lempriere is right, in the arrangement of the conſuls. This is rendered more probable, by the eruption of Etna, in the ſpring of the ſame year; as it is a known and common fact, that earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes are preceded by exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive drouth; owing probably to a gradual increaſe of ſubterranean heat, or unuſual electrical diſcharges and evaporation, ſome weeks, or months, before the exploſion.</p>
                        <p>The comet undoubtedly appeared either in the year, preceding, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or following the drouth; that is, in the year of Rome, 327, 328, or 329, correſponding with year before the Chriſtian era, 427, 426, or 425. It was moſt probably in the year of the drouth, and in the fifth year of the war, A. U. C. 327, and B. C. 427; the earthquakes and volcanoe followed in the ſpring of the next year.</p>

                     <pb n="39" facs="unknown:036687_0043_100AA0AE4534B3E0"/>The plague in Athens broke out in the ſecond year of the Peloponneſian war, when all the inhabitants of the Athenian territory, were crouded into the city, to avoid the deſtructive ravages of the Lacedemonians. This circumſtance alone would account for the production of peſtilential diſeaſes in the city. But it is probable that had the ſame event happened in a period of general health, the ſickneſs in Athens would have been lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited to the dyſentery, the more violent camp fevers or common typhus.</p>
                  <p>But unfortunately this war broke out at a time of univerſal peſtilence, when the diſeaſes of the healthieſt countries aſſume new and more malignant ſymptoms, and hence we account for the duration and the violence of the malady. This idea ſeems to be important, and the only material one to be added to the excellent philoſophical account of the plague at Athens by Dr. Elihu H. Smith, late of New-York. Medical Repoſitory, vol. 1, art. 1. The origin of this peſtilence is ſtated by the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to have been in that part of Ethiopia which borders on Egypt; thence extending to Egypt, Lybia, the King's domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions or Perſia, and to Greece. Some of the more violent of modern plagues have firſt appeared in the ſame region. But we are not to conclude from this deſcription that the diſeaſe is prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated by infection from perſon to perſon. It appears firſt where
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036687_0044_100AA0B0B7732120"/>
the original or ſecondary cauſes, that is, general and local con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, are the moſt powerful. If the ſtate of the atmoſphere over the world, at any one time, is equally vitiated by ſome unknown cauſe, its effects will firſt appear in places where that ſtate of air is moſt powerfully aided by <hi>local</hi> vitiation, as in cities or marſhy grounds. Of this we have numerous proofs. But, in modern times, whenever the general contagion, united with local cauſes, produces plague in Egypt or Conſtantinople, it produces ſome milder epidemic in the neighboring countries, and often, its effects are viſible, at the ſame time, in moſt parts of the world.</p>
                  <p>The Abbe Barthelemy, in his elegant Travels of Anacharſis, ſpeaking of the plague in Athens, ſays, "it was doubtleſs bro't into Greece by a veſſel from Egypt." It is to be regretted that ſuch an accurate and judicious writer ſhould have indulged <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture</hi> on this intereſting ſubject. He quotes no authority for his opinion, and the words of Thucydides oppoſe the ſuppoſition. The diſeaſe firſt appeared in the Piraeus, the harbor; and ſo ignorant were the people of the cauſe, that they aſcribed it to the poiſoning of the wells by the Lacedemonians. Beſides Thucydides impliedly acknowledges that he and others knew nothing of its origin; for he calls on "every one, phyſician or not, to aſſign any credible account of its riſe, or the cauſes powerful enough to produce it."</p>
                  <p>Plutarch, in his life of Pericles, ſays "the enemies of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles, attributed this diſaſter to the multitude of people he had collected into the city, during the heat of ſummer"—a charge in which there was much truth.</p>
                  <p>But when we attend to the violent concuſſions of nature, that accompanied and followed the peſtilence, and its general preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the world for a ſeries of ten or twelve years, all attempts to trace its origin to infection, dwindle into puerilities; and the occaſional cauſes of ſickneſs, crouded population, heat and bad diet, tho powerful as auxiliaries, could not be adequate to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and continued effects in Athens, and the neighboring cities.</p>
                  <p>The ſymptoms of that diſeaſe in Athens, as deſcribed by Thucydides, are known to every medical man. They correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036687_0045_100AA0B24600B288"/>
in all the eſſential particulars, with thoſe of the Yellow Fever in its worſt forms, and the diſeaſe was probably what I call the bilious plague. There is the more reaſon to believe this ſuppoſition, as Thucydides has not mentioned, among the ſymptoms, the buboes and other ſwellings of the glands, which diſtinguiſh the inguinal plague. The critical days were the ſeventh or ninth, as they have moſt frequently been in the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious plague in America.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe extended to other towns in Attica, eſpecially to thoſe which were moſt populous, but Lacedemon eſcaped. It raged in Perſia at the ſame time, and it is ſaid, the King of Perſia ſent for Hippocrates to lend his aid in arreſting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the peſtilence, but the latter declined leaving his own country.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſuppoſed that Hippocrates was in Athens during this plague; but this muſt be a miſtake. He was probably at Thaſus, an iſland, near the coaſt of Macedonia. The four epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic years, which he has deſcribed, were cotemporary with the peſtilence in Athens; and this proves what will hereafter appear more fully, that in all great plagues, the epidemic or peſtilential principle extends to different countries, and often over the whole earth.</p>
                  <p>In this peſtilence, as we ſhall have occaſion to obſerve in many ſubſequent inſtances, the birds abandoned the infected at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 341, and B. C. 413, a peſtilence aroſe which the hiſtorian repreſents as more alarming than fatal, "mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacior tamen quam pernicioſior." This circumſtance affords ground to believe the peſtilence to have been a violent autumnal bilious fever, and not riſing to the utmoſt malignity of the plague.</p>
                  <p>The peſtilence of that year was <hi>followed</hi> by famin in the next; owing to a neglect of agriculture; the people having been prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally occupied with ſedition, under their ambitious demagogues. It will be remarked that the famin was not the cauſe of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, for it ſucceeded it.</p>

                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:036687_0046_100AA0B3CD03FC48"/>It is proper to remark here that all the preceding deadly plagues which had at times almoſt deſolated Rome, were certainly the produce of the country. The Romans were not a commercial people, nor had they any commercial intercourſe with Egypt, till the conqueſt of Carthage, two centuries and a half after this period. It was not till one hundred and forty ſeven years after the time now under conſideration, that the Romans owned a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſhip. When they tranſported troops into Sicily, they hired or borrowed veſſels for the purpoſe. Egypt was a granary of corn, but until after the conqueſt of Carthage, the Romans drew their ſupplies wholly from Italy and Sicily. There is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence therefore for ſuppoſing the plague ever imported into Rome; nor is there a ſuggeſtion in hiſtory, that its origin was ever aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to that ſource.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 353, and B. C. 401, happened a moſt ſevere winter. The Tyber was frozen over, and the high-ways rendered impaſſible by deep ſnow. Theſe were unuſual phenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena and deemed prodigies in that city. On the opening of ſpring, the weather changed ſuddenly from ſevere cold to great heat and drouth, and a mortal peſtilence enſued among men and cattle. The hiſtorian ſays nothing more of the cauſe of the mortality, than "Sive ex intemperie coeli, raptim ex mutatione in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium facta, ſive alia qua de cauſa, gravis peſtilenſque omnibus animalibus aestas excepit, cujus inſanabili pernicie quando nec cauſa nec finis inveniebatur, libri Sibillini ex ſenatus conſulto adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ſunt." On this melancholy occaſion was inſtituted the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Lectiſternium to appeaſe the Gods and ſolicit the reſtoration of health.</p>

                  <p>With this period of peſtilence correſponds the dreadful plague which about 404 B. C. almoſt depopulated Carthage. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe on the coaſt of Africa preceded its appearance in Rome, as it uſually does in modern times.</p>
                  <p>Soon after, the Carthaginians under Imilco, who were ſent to reduce Sicily which had revolted, were ſeized with the plague and the army was ſo weakened, that Imilco was compelled to abandon the iſland. Juſt before Imilco's arrival, an eruption of

Etna laid waſte the neighboring country. By an expreſſion of Juſtin, we have ground to believe a comet appeared about the ſame time. "Imilco, qui multas civitates cepiſſet, repente <hi>peſtilentis ſideris vi,</hi> exercitum amiſit."</p>

                  <p>This plague was remarkable for its ſymptoms, ſuch as violent dyſenteries, raging fevers, burning entrails, acute pains in every part of the body; and many were ſeized with madneſs, ſo that they ſallied forth into the ſtreets, and tore to pieces thoſe who fell in their way.</p>
                  <p>It was during the dry ſeaſon above mentioned that the Lake of Alba roſe ſuddenly, without apparent cauſe, and overflowed its banks—an event that cauſed great conſternation in Rome, but one that might well happen by a ſubterranean diſcharge of ſome water-fountains in the high adjoining hills.</p>
                  <p>This is one of the inſtances which will often occur, of a hard winter, followed by a dry hot ſummer, and therefore deſerves particular notice; for ſuch exceſſes in the temperature of the ſeaſons are among the cauſes of peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>A peſtilence broke out in the armies of the Romans and Gauls, while the latter, under Brennus, were beſieging Rome, Anno Romae 361, B. C. 393. The Gauls, unaccuſtomed to ſuch heat, and placed between hills, where they were expoſed to a burning ſun, vapor and ſmoke, periſhed in ſuch multitudes, that, weary with burying dead bodies, the ſurvivors burnt them in piles.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy b. 5. 48.</bibl>
                  <p>Pliny, lib. 2. 26, mentions the appearance of a comet, or light in the heavens, called by the Greeks <hi>docus</hi> or <hi>doces,</hi> and by the Romans <hi>trabs,</hi> from its reſemblance to a beam, at the time of the defeat of the Lacedemonian fleet—"Cum Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monii, claſſe victu, imperium Greciae amiſere," By the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, "the loſs of the empire of Greece," I ſuppoſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the defeat of the fleet by Conon and the Perſians in the year of Rome 360, and B.

                  <p>In the year of Rome 388, B. C. 366, commenced a moſt deſolating plague of three years duration. This was a time of profound peace, "ab ſeditione et a bello quietis rebus, ne quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do a metre ac periculis vacarent, peſtilentia ingens orta." It ſeemed to be the deſtiny of Rome never to be exempt from fear and dangers; for when war and ſedition ceaſed, peſtilence aroſe.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy b. 7. 1.</bibl>
                  <p>In this horrible plague, periſhed the great Camillus, and it is related that, in the height of the diſeaſe, 10,000 citizens died in a day.</p>
                  <p>On this occaſion, recourſe was had to the ceremony of the Lectisternium,<note n="*" place="bottom">This ceremony conſiſted in placing the ſtatues of Apollo, Latona, Diana, Hercules, Mercury, and Neptune, on three beds, and ſerving them with magnificent repaſts for eight days—a mode of checking the peſtilence, about as rational as the modern ſcheme of confining it to the infected place by bodies of armed men, which is much praiſed by Monteſquieu!</note> and to the inſtitution of new games to appeaſe the wrath of the Gods, but without ſucceſs. Some old citizens mentioned an ancient practice, in ſuch calamities, of driving a nail into the wall of a temple. This law was now revived, and a nail driven into the wall of Jupiter's temple. The time of the year, in which the law directed this ceremony to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the <hi>ides of September,</hi> indicates the period when peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence began in Rome to be alarming and violent.</p>
                  <p>Functius, in his chronology, aſſigns the abſorption of Helice and Bura, two towns on the Gulf of Corinth, to the year of Rome 373, the year of the great earthquake in Lacedemon— in which caſe that cataſtrophe would make a part of the events of the peſtilential period of 371, juſt mentioned.</p>

                  <p>Other authors refer this cataſtrophe to the period of peſtilence laſt mentioned, which ſome writers place in the year of Rome 388, and others, in 384; but all agree that it was during the approximation of a comet. This laſt peſtilence was dreadful in the extreme, ſparing no age or ſex. The year after it, the earth opened and exhibited a vaſt chaſm in the midſt of Rome, into which M. Curtius precipitated himſelf for the ſalvation and proſperity of the city.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, b. 7. 7.</bibl>
                  <p>P. Oroſius and P. Diaconus, followed by Muratori, place the commencement of this plague in the year of Rome 384. Oroſius ſays that "in the 103d and 105th Olympiad, Italy was ſhaken a whole year, by tremendous earthquakes. The hundred and third Olympiad, according to our common chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, comprehends the years of Rome from 386 to 389, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. It is probable that is one of the ſhocks of this ſeries of earthquakes, the chaſm was made in Rome as already related. It will be obſerved that this event <hi>followed</hi> the peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>The comet that appeared, during this calamity, was probably that mentioned by Ariſtotle, Meteorol. lib. 1. ca. 6, of which he was an eye-witneſs.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt not omit what authors relate concerning the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar character of this plague. Oroſius ſays, it was not ſuch a peſtilence, as uſually proceeded from irregular ſeaſons, extreme drouth, ſudden heat of the ſpring, unſeaſonable moiſture of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and autumn, or the impure air blown from the Calabrian groves; but ſevere and continued, attacking all deſcriptions of people, and either deſtroying their lives, or leaving them in a weak and miſerable condition.</p>
                  <p>The winter when the comet appeared Ariſtotle relates to have been cold; but the ſeverity and duration of the plague cannot be accounted for on the principle of changes or irregularities in the ſeaſons. It was one of thoſe violent epidemics which never afflict mankind, without ſome eſſential alteration in the inviſible

                  <p>Some of theſe phenomena, exceſſive rains and drouth, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, celeſtial lights, and ſingular appearances of the ſun, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways attend the approach of comets; and it is ſurpriſing that the moderns have taken little or no notice of the fact.</p>
                  <p>The cataſtrophe of Helice and Bura was occaſioned by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſhocks of earthquakes, with contrary and conflicting winds, which ſwelled the water in the Corinthian gulf, above the tops of trees on the ſhore. This was in the winter, during the night, and juſt before the battle of Leuctra. It is fortunate for us that we have a correct account of this inundation; for it perfectly unfolds the true hiſtory of the deluges in the time of Ogyges and Deucalion.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 391, there was an extraordinary dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Italy, during the greateſt part of the day; dilata nox uſque ad plurimam partem diei;" and a ſingular hail ſtorm.</p>

                  <p>In the year of Rome 405 and B. C. 349, a peſtilence is mentioned, but with no circumſtances that deſerve notice, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that it was in time of peace and internal tranquillity. "Quum et foris pax et domi concordia ordinum otium eſſet, ne nimis laetaeres eſſent, peſtilentia adorta"—and recourſe was had to the Sybilline books and the Lectiſturnium. The circumſtance of the prevalence of plague in time of peace, will be often

noted, to refute the idle notion, that peſtilential diſeaſes are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated and propagated principally by armies in time of war.</p>
                  <p>☞ After writing the foregoing, I found in Pliny, Nat. Hiſt. lib. 2. 25, an account of a comet in "the hundred and eighth Olympiad, and year of Rome 398." It reſembled at firſt a creſt, but changed into the form of a ſpear. Now, the firſt year of the 108th Olympiad, according to common chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, correſponds with the year of Rome 406. There is therefore a difference between the common mode of reckoning by the Olympiads, and Pliny's mode, of at leaſt eight years or two Olympiads.—By following the common mode, and placing the firſt year of the 108th Olympiad, againſt the 406th year of Rome, the appearance of this comet will coincide with the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral tenor of facts, hereafter to be related, and correſpond nearly in time with the plague in Rome, mentioned above.</p>
                  <p>Nearly at the ſame time, there was an eruption of Etna, placed by authors in the year B. C. 350, correſponding with the year of Rome 404. It is probable this eruption was within a year or two of the appearance of the comet; according to many modern facts of the ſame kind.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 422, a violent plague aroſe, which, ſays P. Diaconus, was ſuppoſed to proceed from corrupt air, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the conſpiracy of the Roman women to poiſon their huſbands was detected; after which it was aſcribed to that cauſe. Livy does not appear to credit popular opinion on this occaſion. He ſays, "Foedus inſequens annus; ſeu intemperie Caeli, ſeu hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana fraude fuit"—Recourſe was had to the uſual remedies, driving the nail, and the Lectiſternium.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy b. 8. 18. Auguſt. Hiſt. P. Diac.</bibl>
                  <p>A peſtilence again appeared in Rome in the year 440, but no particulars are ſtated.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy 9. 28.</bibl>
                  <p>In the year preceding, there was an inundation at Rhodes.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 458, B. C. 296, commenced a moſt ſevere peſtilence which continued for three or four years. In the third year, a hard winter appears to be related by Livy, who ſays, "the ſnow filled all places, nor was it poſſible to endure
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036687_0052_100AA0D293BE94A8"/>
the weather abroad." This was however in the mountainous country of the Samnites. The Roman conſuls celebrated their triumphs over the Samnites, during this mortal epidemic, and it was a curious ſpectacle to behold at the ſame time, triumphal and funeral proceſſions, and lamentations for the dead, mingled with acclamations of joy.</p>

                  <p>This plague commenced with many alarming prodigies, and violent tempeſts. A remarkable cloud and extreme darkneſs, for the greater part of a day, is mentioned by Livy, under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of which the Samnites attacked the Roman lines. This darkneſs is mentioned, on account of the frequency of the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon, during peſtilential periods.—Perh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ps this appearance may be connected with the cauſe of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>The violence and duration of this plague induced the Romans to ſend to Epidaurus for Eſculapius, which they imported in form of a ſerpent, and in the iſland of the Tyber, where it was firſt landed, they conſecrated a temple to the God of Phyſic.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, Epit. 11.</bibl>
                  <p>It is not improbable, that the firſt eruption of Lipari, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in hiſtory, happened during this period; as it was in the reign of Agathocles, who died a few years after the time of this peſtilence. The eruption is mentioned by the hiſtorian Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias whoſe works are loſt; but the authors who cited them, have mentioned theſe particulars, that the eruption continued for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days, throwing great ſtones to the diſtance of a mile; and the ſea boiling all round the iſland.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 477, and B. C. 277, happened that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable plague which is often mentioned, as particularly fatal to pregnant women and breeding cattle. "Gravis peſtilentia urbem ac fines ejus invaſit; quae, cum omnes, praecipue mulieres pecudeſque corripiens, necatis in utero fooetibus, futura prole va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuabat."</p>
                  <bibl>Oroſius, lib. 4.</bibl>
                  <p>This alſo happened in time of peace. The words of the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian are remarkable. "Sed Romanorum miſeria nullis ceſſat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciis. Conſumitur morborum malis intercapedo bellorum; et
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036687_0053_100AA0D632ADF408"/>
cum foris ceſſatur a proeliis, agitur introrſum ira de coelo." The miſeries of the Romans have no truce. The intervals between their wars are waſted with the calamities of ſickneſs; and when they are exempt from war abroad, they are afflicted by the wrath of hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Short on air has placed this diſeaſe in the year of the world 3712, correſponding with the year of Rome 462, but his chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology is often inaccurate.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 482, a peſtilence broke out in Rome, and raged two or three years, carrying off countleſs multitudes of people. This was preceded by an eruption of fire at Calenum, which continued for three days and nights, deſtroying the ſoil for a conſiderable extent. This period alſo was diſtinguiſhed by earthquakes, in the third year of the peſtilence.</p>
                  <bibl>Oroſius. b. 4. P. Diaconus.</bibl>
                  <p>This period was memorable for a ſevere winter. The ſnow, to a prodigious depth, lay in the forum for forty days.</p>
                  <p>It will be found as we proceed with this hiſtory, that moſt of ſuch extraordinary ſeaſons and unuſual concurrence of great agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in nature, happen during volcanic eruptions and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of comets to the ſolar ſyſtem of which this globe is a part. That comets were viſible, during the calamitous periods mentioned in the Roman hiſtory is probable; but unfortunately few inſtances are recorded, until after the Chriſtian era.—Not an eruption of Veſuvius is mentioned, and I cannot find more than fourteen inſtances of eruptions from Etna, anterior to the ſame era. This defect of hiſtory is of no ſmall concern in a treatiſe of this kind.</p>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 529 and B. C. 225, the Roman armies which were marching into Gaul, were retarded by violent rains, and the plague which infected the ſoldiers. The Romans were, as uſual on ſuch occaſions, frightened at numerous prodigies. In Hetruria, uncommon lights were ſeen in the ſky. Meteors were ſeen at Ariminum, and the waters of a river in Picenum appeared

                        <p>The compilers of the Encyclopedia, Dufresnoy and Functius, place this event in the year B. C. 224, and Rollin and Univerſal Hiſtory in 222.</p>
                        <p>Rome was overflowed, according to Univerſal Hiſtory in 231 B. C. This event may belong to the ſame period: but the compilers of that hiſtory differ in chronology from Hook and the common chronology which I have followed.</p>

                  <p>During the battle near the Lake Thraſamene, a ſevere earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake was experienced, which, it is ſaid, the armies did not perceive. Pliny Nat. Hiſt. lib. 2. 84. This was in the year of Rome 536, and B. C. 218; in which year, Livy relates, b. 21. 61, there was a ſevere winter. Scipio was beſieging a town in Spain, near the preſent Barcelona<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for thirty days, the ſnow was four feet deep. This is mentioned as a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance very unfavorable for the beſiegers. I cannot help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking how cloſely connected in time are great froſts and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent earthquakes. This was the winter in which Hannibal croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Alps and entered Italy. He reached the Alps early in November and was nine days in arriving to the ſummit. His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſuffered incredible hardſhips and loſſes from deep ſnow, bad roads, and the natives who killed many of the troops. At the end of fifteen days, he gave his troops reſt, on the hills near the foot of the Alps, and altho the ſnow was deep on the mountains, he found in the vales, paſturage for his horſes and elephants. He proſecuted his route in the winter, ſuffering great hardſhips from ſnow, and more from rains, which ſwelled the rivers. Early in the ſpring he croſſed the Appenine, and here his troops again ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from a ſnow ſtorm.</p>

                  <p>At the ſiege of Syracuſe by Marcellus in the year of Rome 541 and B. C. 213, happened a remarkable mortality, among the troops, but eſpecially among the Cathaginians, who all periſhed with their Generals, Hippocrates and Himilco. Of this peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

Livy gives the following account, b. 25. 26. "A peſtilence broke out in both armies, which diverted their minds from the concerns of the war; for it was in autumn, and in a ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation naturally unhealthy. The heat, which was more ſevere without the city than within, affected almoſt every perſon in both the camps. At firſt, perſons ſickened and died, by reaſon of the unwholeſomeneſs of the place; afterwards the diſeaſes ſpread by infection, ſo that thoſe who were ſeized, were neglected, or aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and died, or their attendants contracted the ſame diſeaſe. Daily burials and death were before their eyes, and day and night their ears were aſſailed with lamentations. At length the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors became hardened; they neither grieved at the death of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor took pains to bury the dead; and the bodies of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed lay ſcattered along the ſtreets, in ſight of thoſe who were expecting the ſame fate. The dead infected the ſick, and the ſick, thoſe in health, with terror and peſtiferous ſtench; and ſome, preferring death by the ſword, ruſhed on the poſts of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>But the diſeaſe was much more ſevere and fatal to the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, than to the Romans, who, in this long ſiege, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come accuſtomed to the air and water. The Sicilian troops, on the firſt breaking out of the diſeaſe, abandoned their allies, and returned to their homes. The Carthaginians, who had no means of ſhelter, all periſhed. Marcellus, to avoid the evil, drew his troops into the city, where their enfeebled bodies were refreſhed by the ſhades of the houſes. Many however of the Roman ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, died of the ſame diſeaſe."</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable that heat and poſition augmented the diſeaſe among the Carthaginians. They were encamped near a marſh or low ground; and expoſed to the direct rays of a burning ſun. The Romans had poſſeſſion of one part of Syracuſe, and had ſhelter under the buildings. Theſe circumſtances, and their not being accuſtomed to the air of the place, proved fatal to the whole Cathaginian army. Mr. Brydone learnt in Sicily from the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographer of Etna, Recupero, that there was a great eruption of Etna, during this ſiege of Syracuſe. I have not met with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it in the original hiſtories I have conſulted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="52" facs="unknown:036687_0056_100AA0DD254BE1D0"/>In the ſame year, that this peſtilence raged in Syracuſe, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere peſtilential epidemic prevailed in Rome. "Eo anno peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia gravis incidit in urbem, agroſque; quae tamen magis in lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos morbos, quam in perniciales, evaſit."</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, 27. 23.</bibl>
                  <p>This fact is evidence of what will be fully proved in later peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of the world, that a peſtilential ſtate of air extends, at the ſame time, over many parts of the world; and that if a violent plague is raging in one place, malignant diſeaſes, if not plague, prevail in other places.</p>
                  <p>Another important fact related in the laſt quotation, is that the peſtilence in Rome was the bilious plague, as it was not ſo mortal, as it was troubleſome, by running out into long diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>It is a known fact and not unfrequent, that the Yellow Fever, in our climate, is reduceable to a bilious remittent and even to an intermittent; the peſtilence on board the ſhips at Bulama of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ran out into long and obſtinate intermittents. The fever in Baltimore in 1797 began in the form of a bilious remittent, and continued in that form for many weeks, before it aſſumed the ſymptoms of a malignant Yellow Fever.</p>
                  <p>The Roman and Carthaginian armies in Bruttium, a town in the ſouthern part of the Kingdom of Naples, ſuffered greatly by a peſtilential diſeaſe, in the year of Rome 548; but no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars worthy of notice are recorded.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, b. 28. 46</bibl>
                  <p>It is however to be remarked that this period of peſtilence was diſtinguiſhed by the appearance of immenſe ſwarms of locuſts, which overſpread the whole country about Capua. Their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was ſubſequent to the plague mentioned in the armies. We ſhall have frequent occaſion to mention the ſame phenomenon in the natural world, as cotemporary with peſtilence. But clouds of theſe animals rarely or never appear at any other time, than during or near the time of the prevalence of plagues; and by comparing the dates of their appearance, it will be found, that they are not, unleſs by accident, the cauſe of plague, nor the effect; but, like other animals which are generated in myriads, during peſtilence, the produce of ſome general cauſe, and probably of that ſtate of the elements, which occaſions the diſeaſes of the human race.</p>

                     <pb n="53" facs="unknown:036687_0057_100AA0DF498DCD00"/>During the war between the Romans and Antiochus, king of Syria, in 563, an event took place, ſimilar to many inſtances rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Dr. Lind. The Roman fleet, with that of the Rhodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in ſearch of the Syrian fleet, put into the gulph of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylia and anchored at Phaſelis. But it was in the midſt of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the place unwholeſome; and the men, unaccuſtomed to the air, were ſeized with a peſtilential diſeaſe, eſpecially the rowers. Why the rowers? evidently becauſe they were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a hot ſun, to the air and to fatigue, than the troops on board. This ſickneſs induced the commander to quit that ſtation, and we hear no more of the epidemic.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, b. 37. 23.</bibl>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 571 and B. C. 182 commenced a violent plague, which laſted ſeveral years, and ravaged Rome and all It<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly ſo that the Romans could not enliſt 8000 ſoldiers to quell a revolt. In the next year, Livy mentions a drouth of ſix months, and a conſequent dearth of corn.</p>
                  <p>It will be remarked by any man who reads hiſtory with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that during peſtilential periods, all the ordinary operations of nature acquire unuſual ſtrength and magnitude. Earthquakes and tempeſts are vaſtly more violent, than at other times. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient hiſtorians, evidently without deſign, have left proofs of this fact. Thus Livy mentions, that during the period under conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the operations of the war in Spain ware retarded by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual rains, which ſwelled the rivers, and Flaccus, the Praetor, was compelled, tempeſtatibus foedis, terrible storms, to order his whole army into a city in the neighborhood.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, b. 40. 33. and ſec. 29. 36.</bibl>
                  <p>The ſpring of the year 571 was remarkably tempeſtuous, and Livy gives a frightful account of a ſtorm in Rome which did no ſmall injury to the public buildings.</p>
                  <bibl>B. 40. 2.</bibl>
                  <p>Short has placed this peſtilence in the year of the world 3763, correſponding according to Uſher with the year of Rome 507. But Short's chronology is wretched. He mentions a large comet ſix years after this period, of the ſize of the ſun and of a fiery color. Of the appearance of a comet at the period under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, there can be no doubt, tho I have not found the origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036687_0058_100AA0E19608BB58"/>
writer who mentions it and Short quotes no authority but Pozel. He however has made an egregious blunder in the time, as he has in many other inſtances of facts which he relates, of high an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
                  <p>The order of the great phenomena of nature ſeems to be that violent ſtorms, rain and a cold winter, are followed the next year with exceſſive heat and drouth and vice verſa. Violent ſtorms however occur at all times during theſe periods. It will be noted, that the peſtilence above mentioned could not be occaſioned by the drouth and dearth of corn, for it broke out in the year preceding. The ſame fact often occurs, and proves that great peſtilence is not ſolely the effect of intemperate ſeaſons, but that both are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of another cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The preſent inſtance is one, in which a moſt ſevere winter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the other unuſual ſeaſons. In the year 574, according to Hook, and the conſulſhip of Q. Fulvius and L. Manlius, the winter was remarkable for deep ſnow and every kind of tempeſt. It continued longer than uſual, and trees, expoſed to the weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, were blaſted. An earthquake happened, in the following year.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, b. 40. 45. 59.</bibl>
                  <p>This then fixes the year of the appearance of the comet, mentioned by Short. That he refers to the ſame period is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from his mentioning the circumſtance of the inability of the Roman ſenate to raiſe a body of 8000 men; a fact aſſigned by Hook to the year 571, and which can belong to no other period. But from his deſcription of this ſtar, I am inclined to believe he refers to that which is hereafter mentioned, under the great peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of 610, and which Pliny has well deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>This uncommon ſeaſon was ſucceeded in 576 by peſtilence among cattle, and the next year, followed the plague, which made dreadful havoc in Rome. Some facts ſtated by the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian deſerve particular notice. "Peſtilentia, quae priore anno in boves ingruerat, eo verteret in hominum morbos.

                  <p>It is not eaſy to do juſtice to this energetic deſcription of the hiſtorian, but the following is the ſenſe of the paſſage. "The peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence which had affected cattle in the former year, now turned into diſeaſes of men. Thoſe who were ſeized ſcarcely lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the ſeventh day; thoſe who ſurvived that day, were afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tedious diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>pers, eſpecially the quartan ague. The diſeaſe made its moſt fatal ravages among the ſlaves, whoſe dead bodies lay unburied along the highways. It was not poſſible to bury the bodies of the free citizens. Their corpſes lay unburied, untouched by dogs and vultures, and waſted away by corruption. It was evident that in this and the former year, during the great mortality among men and cattle, no vulture was ſeen."</p>
                  <p>In this account, the following particulars are noticeable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. That the peſtilential air firſt produced its effects on cattle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. That the <hi>ſeventh</hi> was the critical day—as it uſually is, in modern bilious plague.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d. That if the diſeaſe had a favorable criſis on the ſeventh day, the patient ſurvived, but the diſtemper changed into an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal bilious fever of the quartan type, and long duration—a ſtrong evidence of what I have before remarked that, if peſtis and peſtilentia are diſeaſes of a diſtinct ſpecies, the Roman peſtilence was the bilious plague.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. This peſtilence was, as uſual, moſt mortal among the lower orders of people.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. Carnivorous animals would not touch the dead bodies, and vultures deſerted the atmoſphere of Rome.</p>
                  <p>The laſt fact is common in <hi>great</hi> plagues; but in plagues of a leſs malignancy, animals do not quit the infected places. Theſe facts ſeem to indicate that birds perceive the peſtilential ſtate of air, before it becomes ſenſible to the human ſpecies. It ſeems that the vultures diſappeared, the firſt year, while the peſtilence was confined to cattle; and there can be little doubt, that the del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icate organs of fowls perceive the derangement of the air, whether
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036687_0060_100AA0E4C3589910"/>
the cauſe may be, the infuſion into it of a peſtiferous vapor, of the abſtraction from it of a portion of the vital principle, before its effects are viſible in larger animals, and before the air is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered offenſive by the carcaſes of diſeaſed and dead animals.</p>
                  <p>This was one of thoſe violent and long continued plagues of which hiſtory has recorded many inſtances; and the Romans on this occaſion, ſaw many prodigies. It is difficult, in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to diſtinguiſh, in the relations of hiſtorians, truth from vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar report; and philoſophy muſt guard againſt the illuſions of credulity and terrified imaginations. I take no notice of the monſters born, and an ox's ſpeaking, on theſe occaſions. At the beginning of the late American war, many ſimilar prodigies were announced and believed by the ignorant and credulous. But ſome of the phenomena, enumerated by Livy among prod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igies, in all probability, had a real exiſtence, for it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated hereafter that ſimilar appearances have been obſerved, in modern times, during peſtilence, and appear evidently to have a connection with its cauſes.</p>
                  <p>During the plague above mentioned, a bow was ſeen in the ſky, in a ſerene day, extended over the temple of Saturn in the Roman forum; three ſuns or haloes appeared, and at night many torches, or meteors deſcended in Lanuvium. There is ſtrong evidence for believing theſe phenomena to be occaſioned by a vapor emitted from the earth, in ſuperabundant quantities, and which there is reaſon to think, may be the cauſe of peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſeaſes; or there may be ſome changes in the combination of ſubſtances compoſing the atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>At the cloſe of this peſtilential period, in 581, Apulia was deluged by ſwarms of locuſts; as the Pontine territory had been the year before. So deſtructive were their ravages, that the Praetor Sicinius was ſent with an army to drive them away.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, b. 42. 2 &amp; 10.</bibl>
                  <p>Oroſius b. 4 relates, that a moſt violent plague deſolated Rome in the year 610 and B. C. 144. The dead bodies lay pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefying in the houſes and ſtreets, and rendered it impoſſible to approach the city. In the preceding year appeared a remarkable comet. As we come down to the more authentic periods of hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, this phenomenon will more frequently occur.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="unknown:036687_0061_100AA0E9E05D08C0"/>It is again neceſſary to remark a difference in the chronology of different authors. Seneca places the appearance of this comet, which he deſcribes to have been as large and luminous as the ſun, "Poſt mortem Demetrii Syriae Regis, paulo ante Achaicum Bellum"—after the death of Demetrius, king of Syria, and a little before the Achean war.</p>
                  <bibl>Nat. Queſt. lib. 7. 15.</bibl>
                  <p>Demetrius was ſlain, B. C. 151, according to common chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, and the Achean war was in the year when Carthage was taken and deſtroyed by Scipio, B. C. 146. The appearance of the comet therefore ſhould be placed in the year preceding, or 147, correſponding with the year of Rome, 607. And this is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly correct, for it is agreeable to general obſervation, that a comet appears early in the peſtilential period, and often <hi>precedes</hi> its moſt calamitous years.—The Encyclopedia aſſigns it to the year 146.</p>
                  <p>Seneca remarks that at firſt it appeared fiery and red, emitting a bright light, ſo as to overcome the darkneſs of the night. Gradually its magnitude leſſened and its brightneſs vaniſhed.</p>
                  <p>This plague was ſtill more deadly than that in which Camillus died.</p>
                  <bibl>Muratori, vol. 1.</bibl>
                  <p>In the year of Rome 628, and B. C. 126, hiſtorians relate, that a moſt dreadful peſtilence aroſe in Africa, from dead lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts. Theſe animals were brought towards Numidia and Utica, by a ſtrong eaſt wind, in ſuch innumerable multitudes, that they devoured every green thing—not ſparing even the bark of trees. They were driven by the ſouth wind into the Mediterranean, and being waſhed on ſhore, in the hot ſeaſon, they putrefied, and cauſed a moſt deadly plague. It is related that 800,000 perſons periſhed in Numidia alone; 200,000 on the ſea coaſt of Carthage and Utica, and 30,000 of the Roman troops. No leſs than 1500 dead bodies were carried out of one gate of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, in a ſingle day.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, Epit. 60. Oroſius, lib. 5. P. Diac. Auguſt. Hiſt. 813.</bibl>
                  <p>Authors aſcribe this plague to the dead locuſts; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs that cauſe had its influence. At the ſame time, there is no
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036687_0062_100AA0EB66EDDDB8"/>
neceſſity of reſorting to the locuſts, for this was a time of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral peſtilence. The ſame ſtate of air or other elements which favored the generation of diſeaſe, firſt exiſted, and produced this unuſual number of locuſts. This will appear in ſubſequent parts of this hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Oroſius gives a moſt hideous account of the peſtiferous ſtate of air from the locuſts. He avers that birds, cattle and wild beaſts periſhed by means of the corruption of the air, and thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the evil. He remarks further that, altho locuſts had often appeared in his days, in great numbers, yet they never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had done more miſchief when dead, than when living, ſo as to cauſe mankind to wiſh they had not periſhed.</p>
                  <p>We muſt accede to the opinion of the ancients that the ſtench of the locuſts was one cauſe of the peſtilence; it is poſſible that no epidemic diſeaſe would have been excited without that cauſe; but it is equally true, that in a healthy ſtate of the atmoſphere, no putrefaction of dead bodies has ever been known to produce an epidemic peſtilence. It may be powerful enough to excite diſeaſe within a ſmall extent of its own atmoſphere; but if no other cauſe of diſeaſe exiſts, it will not extend beyond that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>The appearance of immenſe multitudes of locuſts, during peſtilence, is a curious fact in natural hiſtory, and well deſerves inveſtigation; but theſe animals do not always <hi>precede</hi> the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the diſeaſes of the ſame period, nor do they often periſh in ſuch collections as to be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of thoſe diſeaſes. The common idea in Arabia, is, that they are generated by heat and drouth. Cold and rains are ſuppoſed to deſtroy their eggs.</p>
                  <p>About the beginning of this deſtructive period, appeared a comet. The Encyclopedia mentions <hi>two,</hi> in the year of Rome 629, and B. C. 125. But it is probable this is a miſtake of the compilers. The univerſal hiſtory places one under the year 630, and a ſecond under the following year, quoting Juſtin, for au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But Juſtin mentions two comets, one at the birth of Mithridates, another in the year he began to reign. Now Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates was about eleven or twelve years old when he came to
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036687_0063_100AA0ECF17A9C58"/>
the throne, in the year of Rome 631, and B. C. 123. Of courſe the firſt comet muſt have been about the year 620, and B. C. 134.</p>
                  <p>It is no inconſiderable proof of the truth of Juſtin's account, and of the accuracy of our chronology in this particular, that there was an eruption of the great volcano of Sicily, in both the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods when theſe comets are ſaid to have appeared. In the year 620, and B. C. 134, there was an eruption of Etna, tho not mentioned by Juſtin; and this was the year of the firſt great comet, and of the birth of Mithridates. Nine years after, in 629, there was a ſecond eruption of Etna. The laſt year cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds nearly with the period in which Mithridates began to reign, allowing him to be eleven years old, and with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the ſecond comet.</p>
                  <p>This laſt comet produced moſt tremendous effects, as we might expect from its magnitude, and proximity to the earth. The following is Juſtin's deſcription of it. "Nam et eo quo genitus eſt anno, et eo quo regnare primum coepit, ſtella cometes, per utrumque tempus, 70 diebus ita luxit, ut coelum omne fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grare videreter." For 70 days the heavens appeared to be in a flame.</p>
                  <bibl>Lib. 37. 2.</bibl>
                  <p>The eruptions of the volcano were equally remarkable.</p>
                  <p>The lava from Etna laid waſte the city and ſuburbs of Catana.</p>

                  <p>In Paulus Diaconus we have a relation of ſingular facts in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the eruption of Etna. Globes of fire were thrown from the Crater. Lipari, a ſmall volcanic iſland on the north of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily, became ſo heated, during the eruption, that the rocks were diſſolved, tho it is not ſaid that this iſland diſcharged any fire. The water of the neighboring ſea was ſo heated as to kill the fiſh, and melt the pitch on the decks of veſſels. Dead fiſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the ſurface of the water, and many perſons, who were near the iſland, were ſuffocated with heat.</p>
                  <p>This author places the appearance of the locuſts which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the plague in Africa, in the year <hi>after</hi> the eruption of Etna.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036687_0064_100AA0EF49A17C10"/>
Others place this event, a year <hi>before</hi> the eruption. It is much to be regretted that authors have been ſo careleſs of the chronol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy of important phenomena, on the <hi>order</hi> of which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend important principles. This however is certain, that all the great agitations of nature here related belong to the ſame period, and it is not ſurpriſing that they were attended with moſt mortal peſtilence.</p>

                  <p>The foregoing period of peſtilence was one of the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on record.</p>
                  <p>It will be found invariably true, in every period of the world, that the violence and extent of the plague has been nearly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the number and violence of the following phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na—earthquakes, eruptions of volcanoes, meteors, tempeſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations</p>

                  <p>It muſt have been during this period that the comet appeared which is mentioned by Pliny. Nat. Hiſt. lib. 2. cap 25. "Civili motu, Octavio Conſule," for this was the year, in which Octavius was Conſul. This period was preceded by an extraordinary colliſion and diſrupture of two mountains, and the burſting of fire from the chaſm, in the territory of Modena. Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny aſſures us, this was ſeen from the Emilian way, by an immenſe number of Roman knights and others.</p>
                  <bibl>Pliny Nat. Hiſt. lib. 2. 83.</bibl>
                  <p>With this period correſponds the eruption of a volcano in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>era, one of the Aeolian iſles, north of Sicily, now called Lipari, which burnt for ſeveral days, and the very ſea around it appeared to be fire. Pliny ſays this was during the Social War.</p>

                  <p>The year B. C. 44 was diſtinguiſhed by the death of Julius Ceſar, by the hands of conſpirators; ſoon after which appeared a comet, ſuppoſed to be the ſame which appeared in

1680, whoſe period is calculated to be 575 years. If this is its period, it muſt have been ſeen in the year B. C. 1767, in the reign of Ogyges, when Attica was inundated and rendered barren for a number of years; and when the planet Venus is ſaid to have changed her figure, color and courſe. When we ſurvey the uniform effects of comets in tempeſts and floods, and compare the traditional account of that event with the terrible inundations which have happened in Greece at other times, and eſpecially with that in the time of Thucydides, which rent Ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanta from the main land; which events all took place during the approach of comets; we are conſtrained to believe the fact of the Ogygean deluge, and fable riſes to the dignity of authentic hiſtory. This inundation might have happened during the approach of ſome other comet, but the probability is, that it was during that of the comet under conſideration, which fixes the time of the Ogygean flood, in the year B. C. 1767. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may ſerve to correct the chronology of the early events in Greece.</p>
                  <bibl>See Jackſon's chronology vol. 3. 312.</bibl>
                  <p>Its next appearance muſt have been in the year A. C. 1193, when Electra, one of the pleiads, abandoned her ſiſter orbs, and fled from the Zodiac to the north pole.</p>
                  <p>Its third appearance correſponds with the year A. C. 618, the year of the terrible comet of the Sybill, ſays Gibbon; and its fourth, is the one under conſideration. Its ſubſequent appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances A. D. 531, 1106 and 1680 will be hereafter mentioned. All the periods here named, which come within the limits of authentic hiſtory, have been remarkable for peſtilence, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, inundations or other great phenomena. Such was the fact in 44 and 43. There was a terrible inundation of the Tyber, a violent earthquake, many unuſual pheno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But another phenomenon, the paleneſs or defect of light, in the ſun, deſerves more particular attention. Pliny aſſerts that this pale color laſted almoſt a year. His words are, "Fiunt prodigioſi et longiores ſolis defectus, qualis occiſo dictatore Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſare

                  <p>The words <hi>ferrugo</hi> and <hi>luridus</hi> give us an exact idea of the color—a paleneſs tinctured with the color of ruſt. A ſimilar defect of light in the ſun occurred at the time of the next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of this comet, A. D. 531, as will be hereafter related. The fact is curious. It is well known that this comet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches very near to the ſun; but whether the defect of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in the ſun was the effect of the attractive powers of the comet, or of an alteration in the electrical atmoſphere of theſe bodies; or whether it was occaſioned by an alteration in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial atmoſphere, is a queſtion not eaſily ſolved. It might have been owing to a vapor, like that which overſpread Europe in 1783.</p>
                  <p>This period was marked with famin alſo, with ſhooting stars, and numerous prodigies.</p>

                  <p>The comet appeared in 44 and alſo the peſtilence—the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Etna in 43 B. C. and therefore ſubſequent to the other events. Indeed it is more generally the caſe, that the volcano does not emit fire until ſome time <hi>after</hi> the appearance of the plague. To this however there are exceptions. Moſt of the great plagues appear two or three years, with different degrees of violence; and during this period, volcanoes diſcharge im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe quantities of lava.</p>
                  <p>By a paragraph in Uſher's Annals, p. 684, it appears the winter following the appearance of this comet, was ſevere.</p>

An eruption of Etna, which laid all the neighboring towns in ruins, marked the commencement of this period, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was preceded in 31 by an earthquake in Judea, in which thouſands of people periſhed in the ruins of their houſes. About the ſame time appeared, ſays Dion Caſſius, "thoſe meteors which the Greeks call comets." Theſe phenomena were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a peſtilence in Jeruſalem, which deſtroyed a great part of the nobles and people of the Jews. The ſame period was marked by a great inunda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>By a curious circumſtance, we learn that a hard winter and peſtilence afflicted Rome at this period. The Emperor Octavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Auguſtus, in his 5th Conſulſhip, B. C. 29, had formed the deſign of reſigning the empire. Horace, the Poet, his friend and flatterer, endeavored to diſſuade him from this purpoſe, on account of the prodigies which happened at the beginning of the year, which was the winter of the year 30 B. C. and correſponds exactly with the appearance of the comet. Among theſe prod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igies, the poet enumerates an abundance of ſnow, terrible hail, thunder and lightning, and a deſtructive inundation of the Tyber.</p>

                  <p>See the 2d Ode of the firſt book, which is worth the notice of the philoſophic reader, on account of the deſcription of the inundation, which proceeded from a <hi>ſwell of the ſea.</hi>

                  <p>It is a fact of which there is full evidence, that during the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of comets, not only tempeſts are more violent, than at other times, but the ocean ſwells without winds—the tides are much higher and high tides are more numerous. The ancients
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036687_0068_100AA0F7F540FEE0"/>
took notice of this fact, and it came under my own obſervation, during the approach of the comet in 1797.</p>
                  <p>In the 21ſt ode of the ſame book, Horace addreſſes Apollo who "drives war, famin and peſtilence from the Roman people and the Emperor, to the Perſians and Britons."</p>
                  <p>This paſſage is proof that the Romans found peſtilence in Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain; but the Britons, at that time, had no trade, except with the coaſt of France. How or from what quarter, they <hi>imported the infection,</hi> is left for the ſolution of Dr. Mead's followers.</p>
                  <p>In the year B. C. 25, according to the Univerſal Hiſtory, a violent peſtilence raged in Rome, an inundation laid a great part of the city under water, lands were left untilled and a famin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>
                  <p>The ſame year, the plague raged in Paleſtine, which was <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded</hi> by a ſevere drouth and a dearth of corn. A hard winter is mentioned about the ſame time, but the order of this event is not recorded.</p>

                  <p>This peſtilence was preceded the year before, by "epidemic diſtempers which proved fatal to many."

                  <head>SECTION III. Hiſtorical view of peſtilential epidemics from the Chriſtian era, to the year 1347.</head>
                  <p>AT the cloſe of the reign of Auguſtus, about the year 14 or according to ſome authors 16 of the Chriſtian era, there was a great famin in Rome, and a comet is mentioned, near the ſame time, by Dion Caſſius. This was followed by a moſt terrible peſtilence in the eaſt, during which twelve cities of Aſia Minor were overthrown by earthquakes. Of theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous events, the following is the account recorded by Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, An. lib. 2. 47. "Eodem anno, duodecem celebres Aſiae urb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is a circumſtance not to be overlooked that the plague was prevalent, anterior to this dreadful earthquake, as the hiſtorian remarks that this cataſtrophe rendered the ſickneſs more ſevere and leſs tolerable. Such is the uſual courſe of theſe calamities; the peſtilence appears, <hi>before</hi> the moſt deſtructive ſhocks of the earth, which rarely fail to occur, during its prevalence. It is to be obſerved alſo that men obtained no ſecurity, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, by flying to open places, for the earth opened and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them up—fire alſo iſſued from the earth.

                  <p>The cloſe of the reign of Claudius and the beginning of the reign of Nero, A. D. 53 and 4, were marked by a ſimilar train of phenomena and calamities. A comet is noted by Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius and Pliny about the year 54, the year in which Claudius was poiſoned. Tacitus relates that people were alarmed by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſhocks of earthquakes, which demoliſhed many buildings, and great dearth of corn prevailed in Rome and Greece. Pliny records that thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſuns, by which are doubtleſs intended, halos or mock ſuns, appeared the ſame year. Theſe were conſidered by the ancients as prodigies; but tho common phenomena, they are remarkably luminous, and frequent in the periods of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
                  <bibl>Tacitus Annals, lib 12. 43. Plin. Nat. Hiſt. lib. 2. 31. Suet. in Claud. Functius Chronol.</bibl>
                  <p>This period was ſickly, tho not recorded as peſtilential. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etonius remarks, "Ex omnium Magiſtratum generi, plerique mortem obierant." Many of all kinds of public officers died; by which we infer that the year was ſickly.</p>
                  <p>In the reign of Nero occurred the next peſtilential period. Two comets are noted, one A. D. 62 and a ſecond in 66. In the year 62, Laodicea was overwhelmed by an earthquake. In the year 68, occurred a moſt violent tempeſt in Campania which deſtroyed villages, trees and grain; and a violent earthquake. At the ſame time, raged a mortal plague in Rome, which is ſaid to have carried off 30,000 people; but by the deſcription of its
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036687_0071_100AA0FFDF7FCFF0"/>
ravages, it is probable the number was much greater. Tacitus remarks that the "houſes were filled with dead bodies and the ſtreets with funerals; neither age nor ſex was exempt; ſlaves and ingenuous plebeians were ſuddenly taken off, amidſt the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of their wives and children, who, while they aſſiſted the ſick, or mourned over the dead, were ſeized with the diſeaſe, and periſhing, were burnt on the ſame funeral pile. To the knights and ſenators, the diſeaſe was leſs mortal, tho theſe alſo ſuffered in the common calamity."</p>
                  <p>As Rome, at the time under conſideration, contained more than a million of inhabitants, ſo mortal a plague muſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed a much larger number than 30,000 people—it is not improbable, a numeral or figure has been omitted by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribers of the original hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The earthquakes of this period were experienced in Aſia Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, at Laodicea and Hierapolis.</p>
                  <p>Seneca mentions that a flock of 600 ſheep were killed by the peſtiferous vapor, diſcharged during the earthquake in Italy.</p>
                  <p>Dion Caſſius relates, that at this period, a moſt formidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation laid waſte the Egyptian coaſt.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be omitted that the violent tempeſt in which St. Paul was ſhipwrecked on the iſland of Melita, now Malta, was in the year 61 or 62, during the approach of the firſt comet.</p>
                  <p>Tacitus remarks, that no viſible cauſe could be aſſigned for the peſtilence of this period; "Nulla Coeli intemperie quae occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reret occulis." No remarkable ſeaſon had occurred, to which this diſtemper could be aſcribed. We ſhall find, in ſubſequent periods, diſtinguiſhed writers making ſimilar remarks. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, theſe authors did not take a view ſufficiently comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the operations of nature; and if the cauſe of plague could not be found, <hi>very near in time and place,</hi> they did not obſerve it. It is true, that an extraordinary ſeaſon does not always precede or attend peſtilence, in a particular place; but by extending our view of the ſubject, to general cauſes, operating over whole quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the globe, and perhaps over the whole globe; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the cauſes, as inviſible, and acting for a ſeries of years,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036687_0072_100AA1016CB071E8"/>
the whole myſtery is unfolded.—Such may be the reſult of this inveſtigation.</p>

                  <p>In the year 79 [ſome authors ſay a year later, but the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is of no moment, as they agree in the <hi>order</hi> of the events related] juſt before the death of Veſpaſian, appeared a comet with a long coma in the month of June. On the firſt of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber following, a moſt tremendous ebullition of fire and lava iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Veſuvius and laid waſte the neighboring country. At the ſame time, happened a violent earthquake, which buried the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeium; and ſo ſudden was the ſhock, that the people, who were attending a play, had not time to quit the theater, and were all buried in a maſs.</p>
                  <p>This dreadful cataſtrophe was preceded by rumbling noiſes in the earth, and the earth was heated to a great degree. Violent agitations of the ſea, thunder and lightning alſo announced the approach of ſome dreadful event.</p>
                  <p>The eruption laſted three days, during which time ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe quantities of aſhes and ſmoke were diſcharged, that day was turned into night, and the aſhes were driven by different winds to Rome, Syria and Africa.</p>
                  <p>The agitations of the earth and the elements were tremendous and frighful. Baronius remarks, that ſome perſons ſuppoſed the world would be reduced to chaos, or conſumed with fire. The fiſh in the neighboring ſeas were deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>This exploſion of ſubterranean fire was <hi>preceded</hi> by a ſevere drouth in Italy. The next year, 80, was remarkable for a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inundation in England; the Severn overflowing a large tract of country, and deſtroying multitudes of cattle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="69" facs="unknown:036687_0073_100AA105C963B790"/>Theſe violent effects of ſubterranean fire were attended by one of the moſt fatal plagues recorded in hiſtory. A remark of Dion is here very important. He ſays that the "Aſhes from Veſuvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us cauſed, at the time, only ſlight indiſpoſitions or diſeaſes; but afterwards produced an Epidemic diſtemper," The remark is incorrect, in aſcribing even ſlight diſeaſes to aſhes; but it leads to a concluſion, which is of moment. The ſlight complaints which prevailed in the autumn of the year of the eruption, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with modern obſervations, appear to have been the <hi>precur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> of the plague, which broke out the next year, and as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors aſſert, deſtroyed, for ſome time, 10,000 citizens of Rome in a day.—The ſame year, while the Emperor Titus was view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ruins in Campania, a fire broke out in the city, which laid in aſhes a great number of buildings.</p>
                  <p>The order of the events in this period was, a comet, drouth, ſlight diſeaſes, and an eruption of Veſuvius, with the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, the firſt year.—In the ſecond, appeared the peſtilence with its moſt malignant effects.</p>
                  <p>In this eruption of Veſuvius, the firſt recorded in hiſtory, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed the elder Pliny; and the Emperor Titus fell a victim to his paternal care of his ſubjects.</p>

                  <p>In the year 107 four cities of Aſia, two in Greece and three in Galatia, were overwhelmed by an earthquake. A comet is mentioned by Short in 109<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as I have not found the original authority, I cannot depend on the accuracy of the chronology. It is probable that theſe phenomena occurred within the ſame year; and there is the more reaſon to believe this, as different and reſpectable authors differ two or three years in the chronology of Roman hiſtory. The next event to be related, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable inſtance of the truth of this obſervation.</p>

                  <p>In the reign of Trajan, the city of Antioch was almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally demolished by an earthquake. This emperor was in the city at the time, and narrowly eſcaped with his life. Some au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors place this event in the year 114; others in 115; but Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius has proved by an ancient inſcription, that it happened under the conſulate of P. Vipſtanus Meſſala and M. Virgilianus Pedo; which brings the event to the year 117. A comet was viſible the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>The earthquakes of this period were extremely violent—ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cities were overthrown, mountains ſunk, rivers were dried up and new fountains appeared.</p>
                  <p>Aurelius Victor adds to theſe calamities a great inundation of the Tyber, violent peſtilence and famin; but to which of the periods, the year 107 or 117, he alludes, is not quite certain, tho probably to the latter. "Terrae motus gravis per provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias multas, atroxque peſtilentia, fameſque et inundia facta ſunt."</p>
                  <p>To remedy the danger from fire and earthquakes, Trajan limited the height of houſes in Rome to 60 feet; and for that regulation obtained the title of "Father of the Country."</p>
                  <p>The great earthquake at Antioch was accompanied with fierce winds, a circumſtance not very common; it being more uſual that ſhocks of the earth happen during a perfect ſerenity and tranquillity of the atmoſphere, unleſs in the vicinity of volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes.</p>

                  <p>During the time that Trajan was making war on the Agarini, a people of Arabia, which had revolted from the Roman gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, flies in myriads appeared and covered every veſſel and utenſil, ſo that the Emperor was compelled to abandon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.

                  <p>This fact ought not to be omitted; as the generation of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable inſects is one of the phenomena which generally attend a great peſtilence—The ſame ſeaſon was marked by terrible ſtorms of wind, rain and hail-ſtones of unuſual ſize.

                  <p>Under the year 115, I find mentioned a ſudden and violent inundation of the Severn in England, which drowned people in their beds, and deſtroyed 5000 head of cattle. Perhaps phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy will place this event, under the year of the earthquake at Antioch; whichever may be the true year, 115 or 117.</p>

                  <p>In 137 appeared a comet, followed by the plague.—In this year or the ſubſequent one, the Thames was almoſt dry.</p>
                  <p>The plague again made great havoc in Scotland in 146.—An eruption of fire from Lipari happened in 144.</p>
                  <p>In the year 153 happened a ſevere winter of three months, which covered the Thames and all rivers with ice.</p>
                  <p>In the reign of Antoninus Pius, A. D. 154, occurred an earthquake which proſtrated ſome towns in Aſia and Rhodes. A comet appeared nearly at the ſame time, and a peſtilence in Arabia, together with an inundation of the Tyber.</p>

                  <p>Of the general and fatal peſtilence in the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Verus, we have many accounts. It appeared in Rome in 167, but its origin was in Aſia, a year or two earlier. Ammianus Marcellinus, the philoſophic ſoldier, relates that this plague originated from the foul air of a ſmall box or cheſt, which a Roman ſoldier had opened, in ſearch of plunder, after the taking of Seleucia. Julius Capitolinus men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:036687_0076_100AA10C4E6D34F0"/>
the ſame fact on the authority of mere vulgar report or tradition. "Et nata <hi>fertur</hi> peſtilentia in Babylonia, ubi de templo Apollonis ex arcula aurea, quam milis forte inciderat, ſpiritus peſtilens evaſit, atque inde Parthos orbemque compleſſe."</p>
                  <p>A. Marcellinus gives a more particular account of this event. "Milites fanum ſcrutantes, invenere foramen anguſtum, quo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerato, ut pretioſum aliquid invenirent, ex adyto quodam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſo a Chaldoeorum arcanis, labes primordalis exſilivit, quae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanabilium vi concepta morborum, ejuſdem Veri et Marci Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nini temporibus, ab ipſis Perſarum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>inibus, aduſque Rhenum, et Gallias Cuneta contagiis polluebat et mortibus."</p>
                  <p>That a cloſe box or other confined place, which might have been ſhut for ages, ſhould contain a peſtiferous vapor which might deſtroy the life of the man that firſt opened it, is not only poſſible, but very probable. But that this trifling quantity of nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious air ſhould be ſufficient to generate a univerſal peſtilence from the confines of Perſia to Gaul, is a vulgar notion, preciſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the modern opinion that the plague is conveyed from country to country, in bales of goods.</p>
                  <p>The hiſtorian adds, that the Emperor returned to Rome, and "luem ſecum deferre videreter," ſeemed to carry the plague with him. But the Romans paſſed only from Seleucia to Rome; whereas the plague raged over the whole earth; ſo that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe muſt have originated in other countries, through which the Emperor did <hi>not</hi> paſs, and from other cauſes than the noxious air of a little box. It raged in Gaul and in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>By attending to the phenomena of the phyſical world, during this period, we ſhall find cauſes fully adequate to the effect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſorting to the temple of Apollo in Seleucia. The ſtate of the elements was deranged, and nature was every where agitated. An inundation of the Tyber at Rome laid all the low grounds, and a part of the city under water, ſweeping away people, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and cattle, and deſolating the fields. Famin and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes marked th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="73" facs="unknown:036687_0077_100AA10E98091768"/>The peſtilence was violent and mortal, correſponding with theſe ſymptoms of derangement in the elements. In Rome, at one time, it is related, that the mortality extended to ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand perſons in a day. Its preciſe duration, I do not find to be ſpecified by the hiſtorians; but it continued for a number of years; in the midſt of which appeared a comet, about the year 169.</p>
                  <bibl>See Am. Marcellinus, lib. 23, and Julius Capitolinus, in Vero. Aug. Hiſt. 580. Hiſt. of Emperors by Pedro Mexiae, p. 172. Echard's Rom. Hiſt. vol. 2. 315 to 322, who is more correct than Gibbon.</bibl>
                  <p>Of the ſymptoms of this deſolating plague, I find no account, except that the patients had a light fever, and a gangrene appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the extremities of the feet.</p>
                  <p>It is proper here to notice a paſſage in Gibbon's Hiſt. vol. 1. chap. 3, which deſcribes, as halcyon days, the period of the world in which this calamity occurred. The following are his words. "If a man were called upon to fix the period in the hiſtory of the world, during which the condition of the human race was <hi>moſt happy</hi> and <hi>proſperous,</hi> he would, without heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, name that which elapſed from the death of Domitian to the acceſſion of Commodus;" that is, from the year 96 to 180.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that, at this time, the Roman Empire was in its glory, and governed by a ſeries of able and virtuous princes, who made the happineſs of their ſubjects their principal object. But the coloring given to the happineſs of this period, is far too brilliant. The ſucceſs of armies and the extent of empire do not conſtitute excluſively the happineſs of nations; and no hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian has a title to the character of fidelity, who does not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, in his general deſcriptions of the ſtate of mankind, moral and phyſical, as well as political, evils.</p>
                  <p>During the period mentioned by Gibbon, not only Antioch, with the loſs of moſt of its inhabitants, amounting probably to more than 100,000, but thirteen other cities were demoliſhed by earthquakes. In the famous revolt of the Jews under Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan, hiſtorians relate that 450,000 Romans were maſſacred in Syria, Cyprus and other countries; and in the wars undertaken by Adrian to ſubdue them, it is eſtimated that 50 cities and 985
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:036687_0078_100AA11194038130"/>
towns were deſtroyed, and 580,000 men loſt their lives by famin, diſeaſe and the ſword. The reign of the Antonines was diſtinguiſhed for multifarious and ſevere calamities. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them, by Aurelius Victor, ought to be given in his own words. Speaking of the Emperor M. Antonine, he ſays, "Niſi ad illa tempora natus eſſet, profecto quaſi uno lapſu ruiſſent omnia ſtatus Romani. Quippe ab armis nuſquam quies erat: perque omnem orientem, Illyricum, Italiam, Galliamque bella fervebant. Terrae motus non ſine interitu civitatum, inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones fluminum, lues crebrae, locustarum ſpecies agris infeſtae, prorſus ut prope nihil, quo ſummis angoribus atteri mortales ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, dici ſeu cogitari queat, quod non illo imperante ſaevierit."</p>
                  <bibl>Epit. of the lives of the Emperors.</bibl>
                  <p>"Unleſs he, M. Antonine, had been born at that juncture, the affairs of the empire would have fallen into ſpeedy ruin: for there was no reſpite from military operations. War raged in the eaſt, in Illyricum, in Italy and in Gaul. Earthquakes, with the deſtruction of cities, inundations of rivers, frequent plagues, a ſpecies of locuſts ravaging the fields; in ſhort every calamity that can be conceived to afflict and torment men, ſcourged the human race, during his adminiſtration."</p>
                  <p>How can that be a "happy and proſperous condition of men," in which they were ſubject to continual wars, to maſſacres, to the ravages of inſects, and to a ſeries of plagues, which deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed probably one fourth of the inhabitants of the globe; and when the Roman empire was upon the brink of ruin? And how can a writer be eſteemed as a hiſtorian, who ſubſtitutes the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of rhetoric for ſober truth, and ſarifices fact to embelliſhment?</p>
                  <p>In the year 173 a peſtilence raged in the Roman armies, which threatened them with extermination.—This appears to have been a continuation of the plague before deſcribed. It prevailed in Rome in 175 and 178.</p>

Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, lib. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, gives the following account of it. "A great peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence raged throughout Italy at that time, but with moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the city, by reaſon of the great concourſe of people aſſembled from all parts of the earth. The mortality among men and cattle was great. The Emperor, by advice of certain phyſicians retired to Laurentum, on account of the coolneſs of the place which was ſhaded with laurels, from which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it derived its name. It was ſuppoſed alſo the effluvia from the laurels acted as an antidote againſt the contagion of the diſtemper. The people in the city alſo, by advice of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, filled their noſes and ears with ſweet ointments, and conſtantly uſed perfumes, for in popular opinion, they occupy the paſſages of the ſenſes, with theſe odors, and ſhut out the corrupt air; or if they do not wholly exclude it, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power its influence by ſuperior force. But theſe things did not check the progreſs of the diſeaſe, and men and cattle continued to periſh."</p>
                  <p>The deaths amounted, in Rome, to 5000 in a day, for a conſiderable time. A famin prevailed at the ſame time, and hiſtorians aſcribe it to Cleander, the miniſter of Commodus, who had monopolized the corn, to compel people to purchaſe of him at an advanced price. Dion Caſſius however ſays, the year had been unfruitful. The peſtilence continued three years. Indeed we may here remark once for all, that when we read of a plague of great extent and violence in any part of the world, under the date of a particular year, we may always conſider that or other peſtilential diſeaſes, as prevailing at leaſt three years. Rarely are great plagues of leſs duration, but often of greater. Hiſtorians ſeldom mention the peſtilence, except in the year of its greateſt violence, but no plague, I will aſſert, ever yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted a particular city or country, without precurſors of a very malignant type. When therefore we ſpeak of peſtilence, as prevailing in a particular year, we are to conſider the epidemic as extending to a period of three, four or five years, perhaps

                  <p>In the foregoing deſcription of the diſeaſe under Commodus, we notice the vulgar modes of guarding againſt contagion, by ſtuffing the noſe and ears with aromatics—a practice that in part ſubſiſts at this day, altho conſtant experience proves it to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>It appears from Herodian that a comet appeared at this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, or other ſingular heavenly phenomena. He ſays, "Ea tempeſtate ſtellae per diem perpetuo apparuerant, quaedamque ex iis in longum productae medio quaſi aere ſuſpenſae videbantur." Comets are ſometimes viſible in the day time, and it is well known that many of the ancients conſidered them as meteors, floating in the earth's atmoſphere, as we ſee in Ariſtotle, Seneca and Pliny, who have diſcuſſed and refuted thoſe opinions. See alſo Sampridius who mentions the comet and unuſual darkneſs, at this period.</p>
                  <p>Another circumſtance mentioned by Herodian deſerves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He ſays, that animals at this time grew out of their uſual ſize, aſſuming an extraordinary figure and diſproportioned in their parts. "Preterea animalia, genus omne, minime ſuam naturam ſervantia, cum figura corporis prodigioſa, tum membris haudquaquam congruentibus edebantur." This fact the writer arranges under the head of <hi>prodigies;</hi> but numerous modern ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations confirm the veracity of the hiſtorian. In many plagues, to be hereafter mentioned, myriads of unuſual animals have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and many common animals and inſects have grown to an unuſual ſize. With this fact almoſt invariably attending peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence, and before the eyes of every man of ſcience in well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted accounts; a fact that demonſtrates a prodigiouſly peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential ſtate of the elements, modern philoſophers, phyſicians and rulers have been tracing all the plagues of the earth to one or two little ſpots in Egypt and the Levant—This circumſtance is hardly credible; yet is true, and indicates <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In 193, Canterbury in England was ſeverely ſhaken by an earthquake.</p>
                  <p>The plague prevailed in London in 211, and a comet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the ſame year. In 214, there was a moſt dreadful inundation of the river Trent in England, which ſpread over 20 miles of country, and deſtroyed many lives. Here is prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably a miſtake in chronology of at leaſt two years—or rather a difference between different authorities. Euſebius, the learned Biſhop of Caeſaria, places the birth of Chriſt two years earlier, than the common or Dionyſian Chronology. Many authors fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one mode of computing time and many the other; and without the original authors, and a cloſe attention to their modes of reckoning time, it is not poſſible to reconcile theſe differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. The uniform influence of comets in producing violent tempeſts and unuſual ſwelling of the ocean, within a year of their appearance and after their departure, may aſſiſt in correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ancient chronology.</p>
                  <p>In the year 218 two comets appeared, and a ſevere froſt of five months is related to have happened in England in 220.</p>
                  <p>There was a great inundation of the Tweed in 218, and a peſtilence in Scotland in 222 which deſtroyed 100,000 lives.</p>
                  <p>In 235 a comet is noted, but I find no other phenomena men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned about this time, except a great death of fiſh in 231, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of which were waſhed aſhore on Britain; and an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in Wales in 232.</p>
                  <p>In the reign of the Emperor Gordian, about the year 243, the earth was agitated by moſt violent earthquakes; and in 245 there was a prodigious inundation of the ſea in Lincolnſhire, England, which laid under water many thouſand acres of land, which are ſaid not yet to be recovered. A ſevere winter is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in 242.</p>

                     <pb n="78" facs="unknown:036687_0082_100AA11B83BEBD80"/>We have now arrived to one of the moſt calamitous periods recorded in hiſtory—a period of mortal plagues, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced about the year 250, or 252 in the reign of the Emperor Decius and continued fifteen or twenty years, through the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Gallus and Voluſian, Valerian and Gallienus. This period was uſhered in by a comet in 250, the winter of which in England was ſo ſevere, that the Thames was frozen for nine weeks.—An eruption of Etna is noted under the year 253, and an earthquake in Cornwall in 251.</p>
                  <p>The plague appears to have been moſt fatal in Rome at two different times, during this period; viz. in the years 252 and 262 or 3, including the year preceding and ſucceeding each of theſe periods. It reached the northern parts of Europe, and in 266, Scotland had ſcarcely living people enough to bury the dead.</p>
                  <p>It firſt appeared in Ethiopia, on the confines of Egypt, and ſpread over all the provinces of the Roman Empire, which, ſays Zonaras, were exceſſively exhauſted by its deſtructive ravages. Zoſimus, after deſcribing the devaſtation occaſioned by the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Scythians, ſays "Lues etiam peſtilens in <hi>oppidis</hi> atque <hi>vicis</hi> ſubſecuta, quicquid erat humani generis reliquum, abſumpſit." The plague in <hi>towns</hi> and <hi>villages</hi> followed the Scythians and devoured that part of the human race which the barbarians had ſpared.</p>
                  <p>Jornandes ſays, the peſtilence "faciem totius orbis foedavit" —deſolated or disfigured the face of the whole earth.—In the reign of Gallienus, 5000 citizens of Rome periſhed daily, in 262, or the following year, a portion of this period moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for convulſions of the earth.</p>
                  <p>This latter period was marked by deſtructive earthquakes in Rome, Syria and other countries. In ſome places the earth opened and ſalt water iſſued. Trebellius Pollio ſays, "Fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful earthquakes ſhook Italy, Aſia and Africa. For many days, [ſome authors ſay, <hi>three</hi> days] there was an unuſual or preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural darkneſs and a hollow rumbling noiſe in the earth, which opened in many places. Many cities in Aſia were overwhelmed,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036687_0083_100AA11D0B4DD450"/>
and others loſt in the ocean. Peſtilence <hi>followed</hi> and deſolated the Roman Empire."</p>
                  <p>In the Univerſal Hiſtory, it is ſaid that this plague ravaged Capadocia and all Aſia Minor, and was followed by famin, earthquakes and a great comet or meteor.</p>
                  <p>Oroſius remarks that "Nulla fere provincia Romana, nulla civitas, nulla domus fuit, quae non illa generali peſtilentia cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repta atque vaſtata." Scarcely was there a province of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, a city or a houſe, which was not attacked and deſolated.</p>
                  <p>This paſſage is worthy of notice, for it will hereafter appear, that altho the plague is uſually limited to cities, where powerful artificial or local cauſes aid the general contagion, yet in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the general ſtate of the atmoſphere has been ſo peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, as to produce <hi>plague</hi> on the moſt elevated hills and ſalubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places, in detached villages and houſes, without the leaſt communication with the ſick and infected.</p>
                  <p>Gibbon chap. 10, has calculated that "a moiety of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies" fell a prey to this frightful epidemic.</p>
                  <p>Cedrenus page 211 ſays this diſeaſe began in autumn and ended at the riſing of the dog-ſtar; or beginning of Auguſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of the air, during this peſtilence, was uncommonly impure. The deſcription of it by Euſebius, in a philoſophical view, deſerves notice. "Quando, inquit, aer iſte pravis undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que evaporationibus turbatus, ſerenus reddetur? Tales enim ex terra fumigationibus, e mari venti, e fluminibus aurae, e portubus exhalationes ſpirant, ut veluti ros quidam tabidus e cadaveribus putridis, cunetis ſubjacientibus elementis inferatur."</p>
                  <bibl>Magdeburgh. Cent. 3. p. 31.</bibl>
                  <p>This is a remarkable inſtance of a ſtate of air ſo highly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, as to form on objects a mould or coat, like a turbid dew, from dead bodies ros tabidus—a ſtate of air which the author aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to vapor from the rivers and the earth.—The account is analogous to what is related of other peſtilential periods, and the fact denotes an utter derangement in the healthful qualities of air and water.—Cedrenus compares this dew to the gore of dead perſons. "Ros ſaniei mortuorum ſimilis apparebat."</p>

The diſeaſe deſtroyed the feet, the hands, the ſight, the hearing and organs of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration.</p>
                  <p>Aurelius Victor ſays of this plague "Simulque Romam peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilentia graſſabatur, quae ſaepe curis gravioribus atque animi deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratione oritur." The plague ſpread, which often ariſes from the more diſtreſſing cares and deſpair. This deſcribes the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate of mankind, at that period; but anxiety and deſpair do not produce the plague, except during the prevalence of a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential ſtate of air. There muſt be a ſtrong prediſpoſition in the body, or an imbecillity in the powers of animal life previouſly induced; or the utmoſt preſſure of grief will never occaſion a plague. But at the time when general cauſes have impaired the vigor of the animal principles, ſlight cauſes will often induce fever and deſtroy life. The practical inferences from this fact are extremely important to mankind.</p>
                  <p>The articles in this account of peſtilence which deſerve par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice, are the introduction of the period by a comet and an eruption of Etna—the agitations of the earth by ſubterranean fire—the preternatural darkneſs of three days, a phenomenon not unuſual at ſuch times and eaſily accounted for, on the ſuppoſition of the extrication of a great quantity of ſubterranean vapor— the peſtiferous ſtate of air which covered objects with mould and corruption—and which generated plague in every village and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every houſe.</p>

                     <pb n="81" facs="unknown:036687_0085_100AA12299E0C180"/>It is proper here to notice an inaccuracy of the celebrated New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in his Diſſertations on the prophecies, on the 6th chapter of Revelations, in which he ſays, "In the reign of Probus alſo there was a great famin throughout the world—an uſual <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of famin is peſtilence.—This peſtilence according to Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noras, ariſing from Ethiopia, while Gallus and Voluſian were Emperors, pervaded all the Roman provinces for fifteen years." But Probus began to reign in the year 276, whereas the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence broke out in Ethiopia under Decius or Gallus and Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian, about A. D. 252 according to Zonoras, but according to other authors, two or three years earlier. Therefore the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence under Gallus, could not be a <hi>conſequence</hi> of a famin under Probus, which was 25 years later than the plague aſcribed to it. Theſe remarks are neceſſary to correct that paſſage of Newton, and they are uſeful in correcting the common notion, that the plague is uſually occaſioned by famin. The idea is probably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philoſophical; but is certainly contrary to fact. Famin often <hi>goes before</hi> the plague, and as often <hi>follows</hi> it. But ſome of the moſt diſaſtrous periods of the plague, have originated during the <hi>greateſt abundance</hi> of proviſions.—Such was the fact in England, in 448, and in 1347, as will be hereafter related. The great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of hiſtorians and phyſicians has been, that obſerving famin and peſtilence often cotemporary, and the cauſe of the plague not being obvious to the ſenſes, they have taken famin to be the cauſe. Whereas it will appear on careful inveſtigation, that fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is an <hi>effect</hi> of the ſame cauſe which produces the plague among men. The dearth of proviſions, during this formidable epidemic, is the effect of a <hi>peſtilence in vegetation;</hi> that is, a failure in the principles of vegetable life, which proceeds from the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the ſeaſons, or defect in the properties of air and water, which cauſes the plague among men.—Famin often aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments peſtilence, and modifies the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe; but in a healthy ſtate of the elements of life, air and water, famin will not produce the plague. This may be demonſtrated by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied inſtances of ſeamen, ſtarving on the ocean, who often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh by hunger, without diſeaſe, or if they had diſeaſes in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

of mere hunger, nothing like the plague has ever been of the number.</p>
                  <p>I cannot help noticing alſo the obſervations of Mr. Gibbon on the calamities of this period. He ſays, "Our habits of thinking ſo fondly connect the order of the univerſe with the fate of man, that this gloomy period of hiſtory has been <hi>decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> with inundations, earthquakes, uncommon meteors, preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural darkneſs, and a crowd of prodigies <hi>fictitious</hi> or <hi>exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</hi>"</p>
                  <bibl>See vol. 1. ch. 10.</bibl>
                  <p>If the original writers who have related the facts above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, had been as fond of <hi>decorations,</hi> as this author, we might well have diſtruſted their accounts of unuſual occurrences. Had this <hi>elegant</hi> writer taken due pains to inform himſelf of the truth, before he had indulged ſuch reflections on the moſt cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible hiſtorians, he would have found ſimilar phenomena to have attended the ſame calamity, peſtilence, in every age from that period to the preſent, and many of them if not all, during his own life, if not within his own obſervation.</p>
                  <p>He goes on to obſerve that "famin is almoſt always followed by epidemical diſeaſes." This point will be afterwards conſidered.</p>
                  <p>He ſays alſo that the plague at this period "raged from 250 to 265, <hi>without interruption,</hi> in every province, <hi>every city</hi> and almoſt <hi>every family</hi> of the Roman Empire."</p>
                  <p>The words <hi>without interruption,</hi> were probably inſerted for the ſake of <hi>decoration.</hi> They are not authorized by the original writers; and cannot poſſibly be true, for an uninterrupted plague in a city or country, would ſoon leave it without an inhabitant. The truth is, it ſeldom raged, more than ſix or eight months, in the ſame place, at one time. It ſeized this town, one year, and that, the next, as we obſerve in modern times, through the whole period.<note n="*" place="bottom">The words of Zonoras per quindecem continuos annos, are to be underſtood as above explained.</note>

                  <p>The more I examin the original writers, from whom Gibbon derived his materials, the leſs confidence I place in his repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of events. He appears to be a partial hiſtorian and a ſuperficial philoſopher.</p>

Sept. and was preceded by a collection of vapor or clouds, that covered the city with impenetrable darkneſs, ſo that the eye could not diſcern the neareſt objects. This was ſoon ſucceeded by flaſhes of lightning and moſt violent winds and tornadoes, which carried buildings to the adjacent hills. The ſcene was cloſed by a ſhock of the earth which demoliſhed a large portion of the city.</p>

This event has been aſcribed to a preternatural influence; but is a common phenomenon in Italy, Aſia Minor, and in all countries ſubject to earthquakes; and as it happened when the neighboring countries were laid waſte by the exploſion of ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean fire, there is no neceſſity for reſorting to ſupernatural cauſes, to account for the phenomenon.</p>
                  <p>During theſe agitations of the earth, the ſea receding left its bed, a highway for paſſengers. Inundations ſucceeded, and drouth, famin and peſtilence walked in the train of public ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.</p>

                  <p>The deſtruction of Nicomedia was preceded by a ſevere drouth—a common event, that a violent exploſion of fire from the bowels of the earth, is preceded, ſome weeks or months, by a total exhauſtion of water by evaporation.</p>

The rivers were ſo ſorelled as to prevent the imperial generals from paſſing into the eaſt to attack Sardis.— Severe earthquakes occurred in the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>About the year 407 or 8, near the cloſe of the reign of Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, a celeſtial phenomenon of a ſingular ſpecies preſented itſelf to the view of an aſtoniſhed world. It was called a comet, but did not reſemble one of the ordinary figure. It reſembled a cone or pillar, but had not the appearance of a ſtar, ſo much as of the flame of a lamp. Its motion was not regular—it began to move from the point of the heavens where the ſun riſes at the equinox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and paſſing the tail of Urſa, proceeded to the weſt.</p>
                  <p>It meaſured the heavens—its vertex, at ſome times, extended to a great length; at others, was contracted into the figure of a cone. After being viſible for four months, it diſappeared. This is the deſcription of it, nearly in the words of Nicephorus. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors were obſerved at the ſame period.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> following theſe phenomena, were ſome of the moſt diſtreſſing calamities. Violent earthquakes levelled cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies—inundations of rivers and the ſea, followed by intolerable cold ſtorms of hail, and a drouth that blaſted vegetation, by which means multitudes of people periſhed. Peſtilence raged in every quarter, and famin ſo ſevere, that the populace deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

that human fleſh ſhould be ſold in market. Paleſtine was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by locuſts.</p>
                  <p>Nicephorus has employed a chapter to deſcribe the phyſical evils, and the miſeries of man, in this ſingular period. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that almoſt all Europe periſhed.—"paſa de ōleto ē Eurōpē." and no ſmall part of Aſia and Africa.</p>
                  <bibl>Niceph. lib. 13. ca. 6 and 36. Baron. vol. 5. 20, 114, 176, 294. Zoſimus lib. 5. Magd. Cent. 5. ca. 13. Ech. vol 3. 254.</bibl>
                  <p>In 418 appeared a comet; in 419 ſeveral cities of Aſia were overturned by an earthquake, and in 420 there was an eruption of Etna. There was alſo an inundation of the ſea in Hampſhire, in England, in 419. Famin and peſtilence prevailed alſo in this period.—A great ſtorm of hail is mentioned under the year 418, and deep ſnow.</p>
                  <p>The next period of general peſtilence commenced in the reign of Theodoſius the younger, about the year 445—or a year or two earlier. A comet in 442, uſhered in a ſevere winter, in 443, the ſnow fell to ſuch a depth and continued ſo long in Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum, that multitudes of men, women and children periſhed. The year preceding, the Huns had ravaged the country and deſtroyed the proviſions, which added to the public calamities. An irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sea in North and South Wales, 441, preceded the firſt comet, a ſecond comet appeared in 444. In 445, ſevere famin and plague diſtreſſed Conſtantinople, and peſtilence appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all parts of the world. In 446, Sept. 17, occured a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous earthquake, which demoliſhed the greateſt part of the walls of Conſtantinople, with fifty ſeven towers. The ſhocks continued unremittingly for ſix months, and extended to a great part of the globe. Many cities were overthrown, the earth, in ſome places, was thrown into large hills; in others, it opened and ſwallowed up whole towns. Iſlands diſappeared and were loſt in the ocean: the ſea receding, left ſhips on dry land, ſprings of water were dried up and new fountains appeared, and in this violent concuſſion of the elements periſhed innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of fiſh.</p>
                  <p>The peſtilence attending, and which rarely fails to attend ſuch agitations of the earth, was univerſal and of ſeveral years dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this period, the plague in England was correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:036687_0093_100A899AA630A450"/>
to the terrible operations of ſubterranean fire. In 448 or 9, it carried off incredible numbers of people, ſo that the living could ſcarcely bury the dead.—And it muſt not be omitted that the plague was preceded by the greateſt abundance of proviſions. This was in the reign of Vortigern, and in time of peace.</p>

                  <p>An important fact here occurs. In 446, the Picts and Scots had overrun and deſolated England, ſo as to occaſion a dearth of proviſions. But this famin produced no peſtilential diſeaſe. It is particularly noticed by the hiſtorian, that the plague did not occur, till a year of great plenty had intervened. This is one ſtrong proof among others, that famin is not the <hi>cauſe</hi> of plague; but often accompanies, and ſometimes increaſes the diſeaſe. It often happens that, during extraordinary agitations of the earth, the elements of vegetable life appear to be defective. The ſame cauſe which affects human health, ſeems to prevent the growth or vitiate the pabulum of vegetables.<note n="*" place="bottom">General deſcriptions are ſeldom correct. I have already taken notice of the miſtakes committed by Newton and Gibbon, whoſe general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions lead, in the inſtances mentioned, to falſe concluſions. A ſimilar miſtake occurs in Henry's excellent Hiſtory of Britain, vol. 1. ch. 1. concerning the calamities of the Britons, in the period under conſideration The author ſays, "the neglect of agriculture naturally produced a famin, which was followed by a peſtilence."—Theſe facts are not correctly ſtated. The incurſions of the Picts and Scots had occaſioned the neglect of culture and a famin; but this famin was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by plentiful crops, which were ſucceeded by peſtilence.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cloſe of this period was peculiarly diſtreſſing in Italy, Phrygia, Cappadocia and Galatia, where the famin compelled parents to devour their own children. The peſtilence made great havoc, at the ſame time, and no remedy or alleviation could be found. The body was univerſally inflamed and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tumors. The diſeaſe deſtroyed the eyes. A cough ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the eruption, and ended life on the third day.</p>
                  <bibl>Niceph. lib. 15 ca. 10.</bibl>
                  <p>This was in the beginning of the adminiſtration of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Marcian, which commenced in 450, in which year anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er comet was diſplayed in the heavens and a ſingular light or

flame, a ſevere drouth "ingens ſiccitas," afflicted the earth, and the calamities of this period continued for ſeveral years.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be remarked here that Functius has placed this comet and the beginning of Marcian's reign, in 454. Such differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in chronology cannot fail to embarraſs an inquiry like the preſent, the reſults of which depend much on correctneſs of dates.</p>
                  <p>Nicephorus and Evagrius give a particular account of an earthquake which laid great part of Antioch in ruins in the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond year of the Emperor Leo, which was A. D. 458. A comet is noted under the preceding year. But they ſay further, that this event took place 347 complete years after the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the city in the reign of Trajan, which was in 117. Now 347 years added to this number, give 464, for the year of the laſt cataſtrophe.</p>

                  <p>In the 311th Olympiad, which comprehends the years from 465 to 468 incluſive, appeared a comet. Whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Antioch was in 458 or 464, the extent of the ſhock, through Thrace, Helleſpont and the Grecian iſles, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the deluges of rain which are ſaid to have ſwept away whole towns in Bithynia, leave no room to queſtion the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximation of a comet at or near the time.</p>

                  <p>Baronius places the earthquake at Conſtantinople in 477, but others place it in 480, which is moſt probably correct.

ruin by an earthquake. Some authors relate that 300,000 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons periſhed in this cataſtrophe, and among them Euphraſius, the biſhop.—This event happened on the 29th of May, about 12 o'clock. A conflagration followed and conſumed what was left of the city. In the ſame ſhocks, Dyrrachium, now Durazzo, the Epidaurus of high antiquity, Corinth and other cities were greatly injured.</p>

                  <p>A ſevere winter happened the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>In 528 Antioch was again ſhaken and ſuffered conſiderable injury. An inundation of the Humber in England is noted about this time.</p>
                  <p>In 531 appeared the reſplendent comet, whoſe revolution is fixed at 575 years, ſuppoſed to be the ſame which was viſible in the year before Chriſt 44, after the death of Julius Ceſar. This was the fifth year of the reign of Juſtinian. Famin and a ſlight plague prevailed in Wales.</p>

                  <p>Not long after the approach of the comet in 531, the ſun aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a pale color, and ſhone with a feeble light. In a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cedrenus, this phenomenon is thus deſcribed. "Toto anno eo, ſol lunae inſtar, ſine radiis, lucem triſtem praebuit, ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque defectum patienti ſimilis." During the whole year, the ſun gave a gloomy light, like the moon, and appeared as if eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>

about the time the ſame comet appeared, ſoon after the death of Julius Ceſar.</p>
                  <p>The appearance, in the period under conſideration, is a well authenticated fact, and witneſſes a ſingular change in the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties, and reflecting powers of the atmoſphere, or denotes an eſſential alteration in the face of the ſun, which is improbable. In either caſe, it ſeemed a prelude to the moſt dreadful calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, famin, earthquakes, and peſtilence. I am not without ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions that Europe might have been overſpread with a vapor like that in 1783, during the eruption of Heckla.</p>
                  <p>In 534 is recorded one of the moſt diſtreſſing famins, that ever afflicted the earth; it continued many years, and deſtroyed mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the human race. Pompeiopolis was this year over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in ruin by an earthquake, and great numbers of its inhabitants periſhed.</p>

                  <p>About this period, Veſuvius began to utter hollow rumbling noiſes, the precurſors of an eruption.</p>

                  <p>Excepting a ſlight plague in Wales—no peſtilence is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the authors I have conſulted, until the year 542. But the famin, in great ſeverity, had raged eight or nine years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore —a proof that ſomething more than famin is neceſſary to generate the plague.</p>
                  <p>In 539 appeared another comet, and the famin now raged with double horror. The country of Italy had been ravaged, the year before by the Goths and Burgundians, and the lands left untilled. This might have contributed towards the dearth which followed. It is recorded that many perſons fed on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man fleſh, ſome diſtricts of Italy were deſerted, 50,000 people periſhed in Picenum, and greater numbers in other diſtricts. The bodies of the famiſhed people became thin and pale; the ſkin was hardened and dry like leather, and clave to the bones; the fleſh aſſumed a dark appearance like charcoal, the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance was ſenſeleſs and ſtern, the bile redundant.</p>

—a circumſtance that the philoſopher ſhould not paſs unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed.</p>
                  <p>The account which Baronius gives of this famin, is, perhaps more philoſophical and deſerves notice. He ſays, the crops failed, corn ripened prematurely, and was thin; in ſome places, it was not harveſted, and that which was gathered, was defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in nouriſhment. Thoſe who ſubſiſted upon it became pale, and were afflicted with bile. The body loſt its heat and vigor, the ſkin was dried, the countenance ſtupid, diſtorted and ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the liver turned black. Many periſhed by hunger; many betook themſelves to the fields to feed on vegetables, and being too feeble to pull them, lay down and gnawed them off with their teeth.</p>
                  <bibl>Baronius, lib. 7. 326.</bibl>
                  <p>This is the moſt probable account of the famin. Repeated inſtances are on record, which evidently mark a peſtilential ſtate of the elements, as fatal to vegetable, as to animal life. In many periods of the world, there has been a univerſal defect in the powers of vegetation. This phenomenon in the vegetable kingdom is cotemporary, or nearly ſo, with peſtilence among men; and ſuperficial obſervers have aſcribed the plague to a prior or cotemporary famin. But an accurate ſurvey of facts, will probably convince any candid enquirer after truth, of the fallacy of this opinion. It will be made apparent that famin and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence are equally the <hi>effects</hi> of ſome general cauſe; a temporary derangement of the regular operations of nature.</p>
                  <p>In the preſent inſtance, the famin could not be excluſively and immediately the cauſe of the formidable plague that afterwards aſſailed mankind, for it was moſt ſevere in 539, and the next year the crops were good. But the plague did not break out till 542, at leaſt I can find no account of any peſtilence, during the famin.</p>
                  <p>An eruption of Veſuvius is noted under the year 532, the year after the appearance of the great comet.—It is probable that the paleneſs of the ſun was owing to a vapor from ſome volcanic eruption, as in 1783; and it is remarkable that both of theſe periods alike produced famin from defective vegetation.</p>

In the next ſummer, happened the ſevereſt drouth ever known; it laſted from Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary to September; and the moſt deadly plague ravaged all Italy. In this peſtilence, died Pope Pelagius.</p>
                  <p>This is a general ſketch of the phenomena recorded of the period under conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Of the univerſal and deſtructive plagues which diſpeopled the world in the reign of Juſtinian I. and the ſucceeding age we have accurate accounts by cotemporary hiſtorians: From two of which, Procopius and Evagrius, I ſhall tranſcribe the particulars.</p>
                  <p>Procopius relates, "That this peſtilence, which almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the human race, and for which no cauſe could be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but the will of God, did not rage in one part of the world only, nor in one ſeaſon of the year. It ravaged the whole world, ſeizing all deſcriptions of people, without regard to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conſtitutions, habits or ages; and without regard to their places of reſidence, their modes of ſubſiſtence or their different purſuits. Some were ſeized in winter, ſome in ſummer; others in other ſeaſons of the year.</p>
                  <p>It firſt appeared in Peluſium in Egypt and thence ſpread weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Alexandria and all parts of Egypt; eaſtward towards Paleſtine, and extended to all parts of the world, laying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſte iſlands, caves, mountains, and all places where men dwelt. If it paſſed by a particular country at firſt, or <hi>ſlightly affected it,</hi> it ſoon returned upon it with the ſame deſolating rage which other places had experienced.—It began in maritime towns and ſpread to the interior country. It ſeized Conſtantinople in the ſpring of 543.</p>
                  <p>Moſt perſons were ſeized ſuddenly without any premonition, nor was there any change of color or ſenſe of heat; for until evening the fever was ſo ſlight that the patient was not ill, nor did the phyſician, from the pulſe, apprehend danger. But in ſome caſes, the ſame day; in others, the next; in others, at a later period, a bubo aroſe, either in the groin, the arm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>its, or
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:036687_0101_100A89A8B15FB988"/>
near the ear, or in ſome other part. All patients alike had theſe ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>Some were ſeized with drowſineſs and ſlumbering; others with furious diſtraction. The ſlumberers forgot all things—ſome would eat if deſired; others were neglected and ſtarved.</p>
                  <p>Neither phyſician nor attendant caught the diſtemper by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of the ſick or dead; and many, encouraged by their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful eſcape, applied themſelves with aſſiduity to the care of the ſick and the burial of the deceaſed.</p>
                  <p>Many were ſeized, they knew not from what cauſe, and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly died. Some who were given over by phyſicians unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly recovered; others who appeared to be in no danger ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily expired. Many died for want of relief; others recovered without aſſiſtance. No cauſe of the diſeaſe could be deviſed by human reaſon—no means of prevention or cure. To ſome, bathing was beneficial; to others, injurious. Many leaped into water and the ſea—In many the bubo, without ſleep or delivium, turned into a gangrene, and theſe died with excruciating torture.</p>
                  <p>The phyſicians opened the bodies of ſome, and found within the ſores huge carbuncles. Thoſe whoſe bodies were ſpotted with black pimples, of the ſize of a lentil, lived not a day. Thoſe who had running ſores eſcaped, and theſe were the moſt certain ſigns of recovery. Some had their thighs withered; others loſt the uſe of their tongues.</p>
                  <p>To women with child, the diſeaſe was certain death.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe in Conſtantinople laſted four months, raging three months with extreme mortality. In the beginning, few died more than uſual; but the diſeaſe gradually increaſed, till it ſwept off 10,000 perſons in a day."</p>
                  <p>Procopius calls it arrogance to pretend to aſſign the natural cauſes of this peſtilence, declaring them to be undiſcoverable.</p>
                  <bibl>Perſic. lib. 2. ca. 22.</bibl>
                  <p>Authors mention the early effects of this diſeaſe on the brain; the patients, on the firſt attack, ſaw phantoms of evil ſpirits, which made them imagine themſelves ſmitten by ſome perſon.</p>
                  <p>Evagrius, who felt the effects of the ſame diſeaſe himſelf and

Procopius, as an eye witneſs, deſcribed the peſtilence of 543 in Conſtantinople. It did not continue inceſſantly to rage in every place, for this would have ſoon left the earth without an inhabitant; but after an interval of a few years, it returned and reviſited the ſame places. The plague deſcribed by Evagrius was many years ſubſequent to that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Procopius. He wrote about the year 594. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions however are general.</p>
                  <bibl>See Hiſt. Eccleſ. lib. 4. ca. 29.</bibl>
                  <p>"I will now deſcribe the plague, which has prevailed in theſe times, and already raged fifty-two years, a thing never before known, and has already depopulated the world. Two years after the taking of Antioch by the Perſians,<note n="*" place="bottom">Under Cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>roes A. D. 540</note> a peſtilential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe began to prevail, in ſome reſpects reſembling that which Thucydides has deſcribed, in other reſpects different. It had its origin in Ethiopia, according to common report, and ſpread over the whole world, falling on different places by turns, and ſparing none of the human race.</p>
                  <p>Some cities were ſo ſeverely aſſailed by this diſeaſe, that they were left without an inhabitant. Some diſtricts however were more ſlightly affected. The peſtilence did not always begin its attacks at the ſame ſeaſon of the year, nor ceaſe to rage, in all places in the ſame manner. In ſome places it broke out in the midſt of winter; in others, in the ſpring; in ſome, it began in ſummer; in others, in autumn; and in ſome cities, it attacked certain parts of the town, and left others untouched.</p>
                  <p>Very often we might obſerve, particular families all periſhed, in a city where the diſeaſe did not prevail, as an epidemic. In ſome places, one or two families only periſhed, while the reſt of the city eſcaped. But we obſerved particularly that the families which eſcaped, the firſt year, experienced the ſame calamity in the year ſucceeding.</p>
                  <p>But what above all appeared ſingular and ſurpriſing was, that
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:036687_0103_100AA141E5F9BDA0"/>
the inhabitants of infected places, removing their reſidence to places, where the diſeaſe had not appeared, or did not prevail, were the only perſons who fell victims to the plague, in the cities which were not infected. And theſe effects were particularly obſervable, both in cities and in other places, in the cycles of the <hi>Indictions.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>cycle of indiction</hi> was a period of 15 years, at the end of which the Romans paid a certain tax to the Emperors.</note> Eſpecially in the ſecond year of each indiction, was the plague extremely mortal. Of this I am myſelf a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for it may not be improper, when the occaſion ſeems to require it, to interweave into this hiſtory what concerns myſelf. At the commencement of this calamity, I was ſeized with the <hi>inguinal plague;</hi> and in the diſeaſes, which have at different times prevailed, I have loſt many of my children, my wife and great numbers of my kindred, of my ſervants and laborers: the cycles of indiction parcelling out my calamities among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>At the time of writing this account, the diſeaſe had already invaded Antioch the fourth time; the fourth cycle of indiction had paſſed, after the firſt invaſion of this diſeaſe, when I loſt a daughter, and her ſon.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe was a compound of various others. For in ſome perſons, ſeizing the head, it rendered the eyes ſanguineous and the face tumid: Then falling upon the throat, ſoon put an end to life in all that were thus ſeized. Some were afflicted by diſcharges from the bowels. In others an abſceſs formed in the groin, a raging fever followed, and the ſecond or third day, the patient died, with his body and his mind apparently ſound, as tho they had not felt diſeaſe. Some were ſeized with delir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ium and expired. Carbuncles alſo ariſing on the body extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the lives of many. Others recovered once and again, and afterwards died of the ſame diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The modes of contracting the diſeaſe were various and all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation was baffled. Some periſhed by once entering infected houſes, or remaining in them—ſome by only touching the ſick. Some contracted the diſeaſe in open market. Others, who fled from the infected places, remained ſafe, while they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:036687_0104_100AA143E4EE6C08"/>
the diſeaſe to others who died. Many who remained with the ſick, and freely handled them as well as dead bodies, wholly eſcaped the diſeaſe. Others who had loſt their children and dependents, and in deſpair ſought death, by attempting to throw themſelves in the way of infection and aſſiduouſly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſick, found all their efforts in vain; they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The diſtemper has already prevailed fifty-two years, to this time, exceeding all preceding plagues: For Philoſtratus was ſurpriſed that, in his time, that calamity had prevailed for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years. What will happen hereafter is uncertain, ſince all things are at the diſpoſal of God who underſtands the cauſes of things and the events."</p>
                  <p>Thus far Evagrius. See alſo Nicephorus lib. 17. ca. 18.</p>
                  <p>The reader is deſired to attend particularly to the foregoing relation of facts, as ſome important concluſions will, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel, be drawn from them, and other authorities hereafter to be cited.</p>
                  <p>It will be remarked that altho authors ſpeak of this peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial period, as of fifty-two years duration, as Evagrius and Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon have done, yet this is not accurate. Evagrius, from whom this number is copied, ſays, the peſtilence had then prevailed fifty-two years; but it was ſtill raging, and what was to happen afterwards, he could not determin.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, plagues were uncommonly frequent during this period; but the diſeaſe did not prevail without intervals. On the contrary, the years remarkable for mortality are ſpecified by hiſtorians, viz. 542 and 3, 547, 558, 562 to 565, 582 and 3, 587, and finally one of the moſt deſtructive periods of all was 590 and the few following years. Altho this was a long and ſevere period of calamity, yet from the beſt accounts I can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, I ſee no reaſon to believe the mortality, in any given term of five or ten years, from 542 to 600, to have been greater, than in ſome other periods of the ſame duration. More people probably died in a ſhort ſpace of time, in the reign of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonines —in that of Gallus and Voluſian—and far more, in the dreadful plague of 1346 to 50.—It is even probable that in the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:036687_0105_100AA14665584D80"/>
laſt 50 years of the 16th century, the earth ſuſtained as great a loſs of inhabitants as in the ſame ſpace of time in the 6th centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. General deſcriptions are rarely correct, and Mr. Gibbon's unphiloſophical, tho eloquent <hi>flouriſhing</hi> deſcription of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the human race, in Juſtinian's reign is calculated to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead a careleſs reader.</p>
                  <p>Evagrius indeed ſays, this plague exceeded all preceding ones. This is natural; Thucydides ſaid the ſame of the diſeaſe in his time. But we are more able to form a correct compariſon between the different epidemics that have prevailed, than the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries with any particular one.</p>
                  <p>Agathius relates that in the peſtilence at Conſtantinople in 558, many died ſuddenly as with an apoplexy. The moſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt conſtitutions ſurvived only to the 5th day. The critical period in the Athenian plague was the 7th or 9th. Thucydides makes no mention of the ſtupor at the beginning of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, nor of the volutatio humi, whirling of the earth, or dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor of buboes, nor of the effects of the diſeaſe on preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant women.</p>
                  <bibl>Freind's Hiſt. of Medicine 416 et ſeq. Baron. vol. 7. 357, 358.</bibl>
                  <p>Warnefred relates of this peſtilence, in Liguria, where it was particularly mortal, that there appeared ſuddenly certain marks "quaedam ſignacula," upon the doors of houſes, on garments, and utenſils, which could not be waſhed out but grew brighter by waſhing. The next year, appeared in men's groins, or other delicate parts of the body, tumors like nuts or dates, which were ſoon followed by intolerable fever, which extinguiſhed life in three days. If the patient ſurvived the third day, he had hopes of recovery.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have ranked this account among the fictions of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed imagination, had not more recent and well atteſted facts given me reaſon to credit it.</p>

In 588 Antioch was overwhelmed by a violent earthquake, and 60,000 people buried in its ruins. The inundation of the Tyber exceeded all that had been known, as did the drouth of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſummer. The intervening winter was equally remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for its ſeverity—"qualem vix aliquis prius recolebat fuiſſe," ſays Warnefred; ſuch as the oldeſt perſons could ſcarcely recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. Violent tempeſts overturned buildings. About the ſame time, ſwarms of locuſts appeared in Trente and devoured every ſpecies of vegetable. In ſome parts of Italy, they continued their ravages for five years. Cedrenus adds, that fiſh died, and this mortality he aſcribes to the freezing of the waters, page 332. —Modern obſervations prove the fallacy of the reaſon here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; fiſh do not die beneath a cover of ice; but the death of fiſh by means of earthquakes, and of ſickneſs, is a common event.</p>

                  <p>Africa was almoſt depopulated by this plague. So ſudden and rapid was the diſeaſe in its action, that during a proceſſion in Rome, inſtituted by St. Gregory, on account of that calamity, no leſs than eighty perſons fell dead in the ſtreet.</p>

                  <p>Gregory of Tours relates, that the plague, at that time, was introduced into Gaul by a veſſel and her cargo, but it did not ſpread regularly from houſe to houſe, but ſtarted up in diſtant and detached places, like fire in a field of ſtubble. Marſeilles and Lyons were made waſte by its mortality. It was moſt fatal to the poor.</p>

                  <p>In 599, the plague in the eaſt, in Africa and Rome, was dreadful. The death of the Emperor Mauritius, in 602, was preceded by the appearance of a comet. A ſevere winter, about this time, killed the vines, and grain ſuffered by froſt and blight. The army of barbarians, marching to beſiege Conſtantinople, was ſo harraſſed and weakened by the plague, as to be compelled to abandon the enterprize. Cayanus their commander loſt ſeven ſons.</p>

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, and demoliſhed buildings, ſtatues and walls in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, with a multitude of cities in Thrace, Nicomedia and Bythinia.

                  <p>In 742, or as others ſay in 743, a moſt ſevere drouth was followed by moſt terrible earthquakes. The next year appeared a comet and the year following, another; and the third year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the drouth, which was either in 745 or 6, according to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent authors, a remarkable thick darkneſs covered the earth from Auguſt to October. At this time the plague was raging at Calabria in Naples, and it continued to ſpread with dreadful havock for ſeveral ſucceeding years, in the countries of the eaſt. So violent was it in Conſtantinople in 746, that the living could not bury the dead; but the bodies were carried in cart-loads and thrown into empty ciſterns, and any place that would conceal them from the ſight. Fatal indeed was the diſeaſe, when "eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem die aliquis mortuum efferebat, et ipſe mortuus afferebatur"— the man who buried a corpſe, was ſometimes carried, the ſame day, to his grave.</p>
                  <p>In the order of the events here related authors agree. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drenus mentions an extraordinary light or flame in the ſky in 742, and a ſimilar flame in the north, the year following.

                  <p>Such was the waſte of people in Conſtantinople by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding plagues, that the emperor Conſtantine repaired the loſs by introducing the inhabitants of neighboring countries.</p>
                  <p>In 760 or 61, for this difference occurs among good author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, appeared a comet, or light, called <hi>dokites,</hi> by the Greeks, from its reſemblance to a beam; which was viſible 10 days in the eaſt and 21 in the weſt.—In 762 appeared two other comets and the following winter was the moſt ſevere probably on record. It began about the firſt of October, and laſted till February. The Euxine ſea was frozen to the diſtance of one hundred miles from the ſhore, and the ſnow and ice accumulated to the depth of thirty cubits. In this froſt, the animal and vegetable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſuffered great injury. On the breaking up of winter, the ice from the Danube and the Euxine was forced in huge maſſes, into the Boſphorus, and againſt the walls of Conſtantinople, which were greatly damaged.</p>
                  <p>In March, falling ſtars, or meteors were very frequent, and the ſucceeding ſummers were remarkable for moſt terrible drouth, in which all ſprings were exhauſted. Myriads of venemous flies appeared, and a deſolating mortality concluded this ſeries of diſordered ſeaſons.</p>

It is altogether probable that ſuch extraordinary ſeaſons ſhould occaſion great ſickneſs; but it is equally probable that if any deſtructive and general plague had followed them, the writers I have conſulted would have mentioned it.</p>
                  <p>I am led to notice this circumſtance, by the conſideration that
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:036687_0113_100AA1570C8A4FD8"/>
no earthquake is recorded during this period. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is of no ſmall conſequence in this inquiry; and is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming proof of the juſtneſs of my ſuſpicions, that peſtilence has an intimate connection with ſubterranean heat or the action of fire. It appears that the plague, for the moſt part, is violent and extenſive, in proportion to the action of the fire that exiſts in and about the globe. The preceding peſtilential period, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in 740, is a ſtriking inſtance of the truth of this remark.</p>
                  <p>A great mortality happened in 766. In 767 a ſevere drouth exhauſted all ſprings and rivers and the year following was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by a comet. Peſtilence prevailed in England in 771, and in Chicheſter died 34,000 people.</p>

                  <p>Short mentions plague and famin in France in 779—a comet, an earthquake at Conſtantinople, and peſtilence in Scotland in 784; but I have no particulars.</p>
                  <p>In the reign of Charlemagne, about the beginning of the ninth century, commenced a period of great mortality. A comet in 799, was followed by an exceſſively cold winter in 800. Theſe events were preceded by violent earthquakes in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily and Crete and in 798, an extraordinary darkneſs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of ſeventeen days. In 801 earthquakes ſhook Italy, France and Germany, and theſe phenomena were repeated in 802 and 3. A prodigious tempeſt in the year 800, levelled a multitude of buildings.</p>
                  <p>In 802 the plague prevailed in various places, "propter mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiem hyberni temporis," ſays the annaliſt Bartianus, by reaſon of a mild winter. This however could not be the true reaſon.</p>
                  <p>In 808 a very mild winter was followed by the plague. In 810 happened the greateſt mortality among horned cattle that is on record. In ſome places in Germany, it deſtroyed almoſt all the ſpecies.</p>

                  <p>In 817 was a comet, and a peſtilence ſoon after commenced, which authors relate to have ariſen from exceſſive rains and a humid air. This plague raged in almoſt every part of France in 820, and crops failing from exceſs of moiſture, a famin enſued. Baronius mentions earthquakes in 820 in thoſe places where the <hi>Chriſtians were perſecuted.</hi> The following winter was ſo ſevere that the Rhine and the Danube were covered with ſolid ice for more than 30 days, and ſuſtained loaded carriages.</p>
                  <p>In 823 was another moſt ſevere winter, in which the ſnow lay on the earth twenty nine weeks, and occaſioned the death of many animals and men. An earthquake and a univerſal plague in France. The next year fell a ſhower of hail, which killed men and cattle. Severe drouth the ſame year.</p>

                  <p>In 855 an earthquake at Conſtantinople, and in other places, violent tempeſts. In 856 another earthquake and a tremendous inundation of the Tyber, which was followed by an epidemic diſeaſe, called a plague of the fauces, in which the throat was obſtructed by defluxions, and ſudden death enſued.<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſpecies of quinſy.</note> In 858 a comet, and the ſucceeding winter was ſo ſevere that the Adriatic ſea was covered with ice and people walked on it to Venice.

                  <p>Hitherto our accounts of the great volcanoes have been very imperfect. The firſt inſtance of an eruption in Iceland, which is recorded, was in the year 1000; and from that period we have a regular hiſtory of volcanic diſcharges in that iſland, which is one of the principal outlets of fire on the globe, and which, we ſhall find, has no ſmall connection with the extenſive and powerful operations of fire, both in Europe and America. There are many volcanoes in the iſland of which Heckla is the principal.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1000, there was an eruption in Iceland, two globes of fire or great meteors were ſeen, violent earthquakes in England, and a ſevere winter followed. In the ſame year ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a comet with a long coma.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="unknown:036687_0119_100AA16385AE8378"/>
for three months, convulſed by earthquakes. In the ſame year commenced a famin, and a plague of three years duration, which deſolated the whole earth. Cotemporary authors affirm that more than half the human race periſhed. The living were fatigued with burying the dead—"ut ſepelientium taedio, vivi ad huc ſpiritum trahentes, obruerenter cum mortuis." Such was the wearineſs of thoſe that buried the corpſes, that the living before their breath had left their bodies, were tumbled into the graves with the dead.</p>
                  <p>At the cloſe of this horrible deſtruction, Veſuvius diſcharged prodigious quantities of lava which laid waſte the neighboring country.</p>
                  <p>In 1009 was ſeen a comet in May. The beginning of the year the earth was deluged with rain, and a plague among the Saxons followed.</p>
                  <p>The plague is alſo mentioned under the year 1012, with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent rains and inundations, followed by an earthquake in 1013. But the neceſſary materials for a detail are wanting.</p>

                  <p>In 1020 was ſeen another comet, and the winter was exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſevere, ſo that men periſhed with cold.

the ſyſtem, with great ſtorms of wind and rain, producing vaſt inundations. In France, England and the eaſt raged famin and peſtilence. Locuſts were added to theſe calamities, which were ſo ſevere in ſome parts of the world, that multitudes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to leave their country Violent earthquakes marked this year, and what is uſual in the tempeſtuous ſeaſons occaſioned by comets diſtinguiſhed by volcanic eruptions, a ſplendid meteor, or globe of fire.</p>
                  <p>During an eclipſe of the ſun in 1032 or 3, authors mention a ſingular phenomenon—a ſaffron color in the air, which gave to the human countenance a cadaverous aſpect. But it might be merely the effect of a partial darkneſs, with a hazy atmoſphers.</p>
                  <p>A ſevere winter in 1035, was followed by an eruption of Veſuvius in 1036. The frequent coincidences of this kind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve notice.</p>
                  <p>In 1037 is noted an igneous appearance in the heavens, like a beam. Theſe phenomena were followed by peſtilence in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and in the Emperor's army, and with earthquakes.</p>

                  <p>In 1042 commenced another diſtreſſing period. A comet in this year was followed by an eruption of Veſuvius in 1043 and ſnow in harveſt. The year 1042 was very tempeſtuous and rainy; the dykes in Flanders yielded to the ſwelling ocean, and the low grounds were overwhelmed, with infinite deſtruction. At this time began a general famin in England, France and Germany. The year 1043 was alſo diſtinguiſhed for rains and ſtorms; autumnal ſnows were early, and an infectious diſeaſe carried off vaſt numbers of cattle. In 1044 there was great mortality among men.</p>
                  <p>In 1047 fell a deep ſnow in the weſt of Europe, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed ſmall trees, and lay till March. In March 1048 was a violent earthquake, followed by a tempeſtuous ſeaſon and great ſickneſs. There was an eruption of Veſuvius the ſame year, and an earthquake in October.

                  <p>In 1057 ſevere froſt and great quantities of ſnow ruined the vines. During the following year, a comet was ſeen, the year after which the winter was very long and ſevere, and in 1060 prevailed famin, and plague among men and cattle.</p>
                  <p>In 1062 a trembling of the earth in Conſtantinople, attended with thunder and lightning, was ſucceeded by the plague.

                  <p>In 1065 ſeveral hundred thouſand Scythians, marching to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Roman empire, periſhed with peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>In 1066 a comet was ſeen in May, and a cold winter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.

                  <p>The north of Europe ſpeedily felt ſimilar calamities. Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent earthquakes in 1068, and a comet in May, of apparent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter equal to that of the moon, viſible 40 days, were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by famin. The country in England from Durham to York was depopulated. Men ſubſiſted on dogs, cats and every unclean thing; or periſhed and their bodies were left to putrefy on the earth. The winters were unuſually ſevere.</p>

                  <p>In 1074 another comet appeared and a hard winter. The winter of 1076 was exceſſively cold from Nov. to March, ſo that the roots of vines were killed. In April 1077 appeared a comet, and famin and plague raged in Conſtantinople with ſuch mortality, that the living could not bury the dead. An earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake was experienced in England. Shocks were alſo felt in 1081 and 1082.</p>
                  <p>In 1084 raged famin and peſtilence; the latter cut off the

whole army of the Emperor Henry, in Rome. In 1085, Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia was laid waſte by locuſts and the plague. The ſeaſons were unfavorable in England, the crops bad and a great mortality among cattle. In 1086, were great inundations in Flanders, Italy and other countries; and in 1087 the fiſh died in the rivers.</p>

                  <p>Authors relate that in 1086, domeſtic fowls left the houſes and fled to the woods. The two following years, the ſame ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities continued—bad ſeaſons, murrain among cattle, and a violent fever, which appeared in the former year, raged in theſe and affected one half the people of England. In 1089 a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plague deſtroyed mankind. Earthquakes diſtinguiſhed theſe periods.</p>

                  <p>In 1091 appeared a comet; another in 1094; a third in 1096, and a fourth in 1098.</p>
                  <p>In 1091, many violent tempeſts happened which levelled buildings, 600 houſes were blown down in London; ſwarms of locuſts darkened the ſun, and the next year a plague raged, which the hiſtorian relates to have ariſen from the putrefaction of their bodies. The place where the locuſts appeared is not named.</p>
                  <p>A moſt ſevere winter in 1093, occured after a very rainy ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in England. The ſummer of 1094 was alſo exceſſively rainy.—The plague at the ſame time raged in England, Gaul and Germany. A violent earthquake with a tempeſt in 1094. The comet in Oct. 1096 was attended with great rains, which prevented the ſowing of winter grain, and famin followed. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fiery appearances and meteors were obſerved, during this period, and the winter of 1095 was ſevere.</p>
                  <p>In 1098 a peſtilence invaded cattle, from the bad quality of their food, which had been injured by great rains. This was the year of the laſt comet above named, and in the following year, was a hard winter and a dearth. Syracuſe was injured by an earthquake.</p>

                  <p>It is probable that the events related in the two laſt paragraphs happened in the ſame year. The inundation is ſaid to have drowned in Holland one hundred thouſand people.</p>
                  <p>A dark day is mentioned in the year 1099.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1100 raged a peſtilence in Paleſtine, ſaid to have originated from the ſtench of dead bodies. In Syracuſe, a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent earthquake demoliſhed a tower, with the loſs of many lives. In 1101 a ſingular meteor, and ſuch multitudes of worms, called <hi>papiliones,</hi> from their reſemblance to a pavilion, that they cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two or three miles of country.</p>

                  <p>In 1105, there was a diſcharge of fire from Heckla, and in the ſame year, a great quantity of ſnow, a violent earthquake in Jeruſalem, about Chriſtmas, and about the ſame time, a light in the weſt almoſt equal to the ſun, and two mock ſuns.</p>
                  <p>In Feb. of the following year, a comet<note n="*" place="bottom">Suppoſed to be the ſame as that which appeared in 531 and in 1680.</note> of unuſual ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor for three weeks was viſible from three to nine o'clock, and two mock ſuns. A violent earthquake happened the ſame year. Many meteors were ſeen and violent tempeſts and inundations, with myriads of inſects in the air, marked the diſorder of the elements.—The year was alſo noted for ſterility of grain, and a conſequent dearth—men were attacked with plague and unuſual diſeaſes—"ignotis morbis, igne, flamma, ardore inviſibili homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes excruciati et abſque ad uſtionis nota extincti."</p>

                  <p>The reader cannot fail to remark how regularly the mention of comets is accompanied with a failure of crops, meteors, and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts. We have proof in modern times that theſe were not the

fictions of imagination. See the years 1769-70—1783-4— 1788-9.</p>
                  <p>In 1107 appeared a comet with a long coma—another was ſeen in Normandy in 1108.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1109 eryſipelous diſeaſes were epidemic in England; which afflicted and deſtroyed many people; their limbs covered with black ſpots, like carbuncles.</p>

                  <p>In December 1109 appeared a comet, and in June 1110 another, which ſpread its coma to the ſouth. A ſevere winter, with deep ſnow and long continued cold, followed and ſterility of grain. An unuſual receſs of water in the Trente, ſevere earthquake in Salop, and a mortality among men and cattle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the year 1111.—An earthquake and ſevere plague are mentioned under the year 1112; but the year was remarkable for abundant crops of grain.—This year there was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary receſs of the water in the Britiſh Channel for a whole day, fiſh died in the water and domeſtic fowls took flight into the woods.</p>
                  <bibl>Magd. Cent. 12. ca. 13. Knighton, Hiſt. Ang. Script. 2379.</bibl>
                  <p>Here we have an account of a progreſſion in the peſtilence— from the eruptive diſeaſes of 1109 to the plague in 1112—This is the modern order.</p>
                  <p>In 1113 or, as ſome authorities have it, in May 1114, a comet appeared, and in a period of diſtreſſing calamities. In this year there was an eruption from Heckla in Iceland.</p>
                  <p>In May 1113 an extraordinary ſnow very much injured trees and vegetables. In June a dreadful tempeſt laid waſte whole countries, and the exceſſive heat of the ſummer produced dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entery and other peſtilential epidemics. In 1114 many cities in Syria were proſtrated by an earthquake; and its effects were felt in all the oriental countries. In November 1115 many houſes in Antioch were ſwallowed up in a chaſm rent in the earth. In January 1116 various places ſuffered by ſhocks of the earth, and in 1117 all Italy was ſhaken for forty days.</p>
                  <p>In 1113 Flanders was overwhelmed by an inundation, which compelled many Flemmings to abandon their country, and they ſettled in England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="unknown:036687_0125_100AA170152AE260"/>This event ſeems to fix the approach of the comet in the year 1113.</p>
                  <p>Severe drouth and a ſingular receſs of the ocean left rivers dry in 1114. October 15th people walked over the Thames between London bridge and the tower. In December the ſky appeared to be in a flame.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1115 was moſt rigorous, and a terrible mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality ſwept away the cattle. A comet appeared this year alſo.</p>
                  <p>The year 1116 was rainy and fruits were deſtroyed. In 1117 ſwarms of locuſts about Jeruſalem devoured vegetation, and in England great damage was done by floods.</p>
                  <p>In 1118 and 1119 earthquakes were violent. In 1120 the locuſts and mice overran Judea, and Trent ſuffered much from earthquakes. A ſevere winter followed in 1121, and a drouth the next year, which occaſioned a ſcarcity of proviſion, and men and cattle periſhed.</p>
                  <p>In the foregoing period, no great peſtilence is mentioned, but ſuch diſeaſes as were occaſioned by intemperate ſeaſons, except among cattle.</p>
                  <bibl>Magd. Cent. 12. Baron. vol. 12. 117. Muratori, Tom. 5. p. 60. Maitland's Hiſt. Lond.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1124 happened a very ſevere winter, which deſtroyed trees and vines—ſucceeded by a cold ſpring which retarded ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation. The following year was noted for a deſtructive plague among men and cattle, in France and Brabant. Terrible was the famin in Italy, and in England ſo many people periſhed with hunger, that dead bodies lay in the highways unburied. In 1125 the famin, accompanied with peſtilence, continued in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany and Italy. The ſeaſon was exceſſively wet and all fruits were injured or deſtroyed. In 1126 appeared a comet in October, followed by a winter exceſſively ſevere, and in the following year, violent earthquakes occurred in Syria. Eryſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelous diſtempers were fatal in England.</p>
                  <p>In the peſtilence of 1125, it was computed that one third of the people periſhed.</p>
                  <bibl>Magd. Cent. 12. Baron. vol. 12. 160. Dufreſnoy.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1130, 31 and 32, happened the moſt deſtructive murrain
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:036687_0126_100AA1721B1307C0"/>
among cattle and fowls ever known in England. In 1131 an exceſſive drouth in France.</p>
                  <p>In October 1133 appeared a comet. The ſame year, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was ſhaken by earthquakes, and inundations continued a whole month. Authors aſſert that the ſun exhibited ſingular appearances, changing its figure and dimenſions, and that there was a remarkable intemperature in the air. In modern times, the face of the ſun is often disfigured with ſpots, and it is not unphiloſophical to ſuppoſe that moving vapor in the air may ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly change its apparent diameter.</p>
                  <p>In 1134 the ſea broke into Flanders, as it did in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing year. This year was rainy.</p>
                  <p>In 1135 the drouth deſtroyed vegetation and occaſioned a dearth. The Rhine was fordable in almoſt any place. Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tempeſts and earthquakes and an eruption of Veſuvius mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this period, and a dreadful plague enſued.</p>
                  <bibl>Short, vol. 1. 118.</bibl>
                  <p>The eruption of Veſuvius was in 1136 and a ſecond in 1139. The ſummer of 1137 was as remarkable for drouth, as was that of 1135. The plague was univerſal. The diſorders in the elements occaſioned a long and deſolating famin.</p>
                  <bibl>Magd. Cent. 12. Piſtorius, vol. 1. 156. Matthew Paris.</bibl>
                  <p>Knighton mentions the ſun's changing its form in 1133, and adds that a darkneſs happened which rendered a candle neceſſary in the day time.</p>
                  <bibl>Chronocon.</bibl>
                  <p>From this it is probable the ſun preſented appearances, like thoſe which we obſerved on the 19th of May 1780, and which are uſual in dark days.</p>
                  <p>The reader will remark the occurrence of ſuch days, in years when electricity ſhakes the earth, or fire and lava are diſcharged by volcanoes. He will note alſo the drouth that preceded the eruption of Veſuvius in 1135 and 1138.</p>
                  <p>In 1140 was an earthquake in England. In 1141 a very ſevere winter. In 1143 the air, for a mile in extent, was filled with an unuſual inſect, with the body of a worm and the ſize of a fly. A general plague among men and cattle began the ſame year, and raged with great violence in various countries.
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:036687_0127_100AA174267D0318"/>
In 1144 or as ſome authors relate in May 1145 appeared a comet, illuminating the heavens, and the ſame year were violent earthquakes. In 1146 another comet, and the plague incredibly fatal. A famin prevailed with diſtreſſing ſeverity, for 12 years, including the years juſt named.</p>

                  <p>If men, at this period, had any reſpite from natural evils, the intervals were very ſhort. In 1150 a very ſevere winter and ſevere peſtilence are recorded in the Saxon chronicle, together with famin and an eruption of fire in Iceland. Earthquakes, inundations and peſtilence marked the ſubſequent years. The years 1151 and 2 are mentioned to have been very rainy—the winter of 1153 and 4 ſevere, and the ſummer of 1156 exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively dry. Theſe phenomena follow each other ſo rapidly, and are related with ſuch brevity and in general terms, that it leaves the mind at a loſs to what influence to aſcribe the diſeaſes which afflicted nations for a ſeries of years about this period. In this gloomy and barbarous age of the world, hiſtory is conciſe and deſtitute of accurate obſervations.</p>
                  <p>In 1157 there was an eruption in Iceland, with a very cold winter. In 1158 an eruption of Veſuvius, an earthquake in England, and an inudation of the Tyber. Peſtilence appeared in Scotland in 1154.</p>
                  <p>Not long after theſe events, Antioch, Tripoli, and Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus were convulſed by an earthquake, with the loſs of 20,000 lives.</p>
                  <p>After an interval of more than 300 years, during which I find in hiſtory no account of any eruptions from Etna, this vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano is introduced to our notice by an almoſt continual eruption from 1160 to 1169. Earthquakes were violent in 1161—in Sicily an inundation drowned 5000 people—in 1163 one of the greateſt inundations in Frieſland ever known, preceded by a very ſevere winter. At this time the plague was raging in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Normandy and Aquitain. Unuſual darkneſs is mentioned in 1164. In England, the ſea overflowed twelve miles of country, deſtroying men, cattle and improvements. In 1165, a comet appeared with a long coma; 12,000 people periſhed by an inundation in Sicily, and Norfolk and Suffolk in England
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:036687_0128_100AA175E6758CF0"/>
were ſhaken by an earthquake. Moſt of Frederick Barbaroſſa's army periſhed by the plague in 1167. This period was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for great wind and hail.</p>
                  <p>In 1169 the eruption of Etna was very violent; Catana was demoliſhed by an earthquake, and 15,000 people periſhed —Aſia Minor felt the ſhock. In the next year, ſo general and tremendous were the earthquakes, that many of the beſt cities in Syria, Paleſtine and other countries, were laid in ruins. Germany ſuffered by earthquakes and inundations. Peſtilence marked this period, and in 1172 a malignant dyſentery raged in England.</p>
                  <p>In 1174 mention is made, for the firſt time, of an epidemic cough or catarrh. There is however no queſtion that influenza and meaſles always preceded or accompanied peſtilence in the ancient and middle ages, as they do in modern times. Authors have neglected to record the prevalence of all the minor epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics, or nearly all, until after the invention of printing.</p>
                  <p>In 1175 hiſtory mentions an eruption of Etna, peſtilential diſeaſes in England and a famin. In 1176 a long and ſevere winter, and an irruption of the ſea into Holland with immenſe deſtruction—a ſevere drouth followed with a loſs of ſeed time. The year 1177 was diſtinguiſhed for violent winds.</p>
                  <p>In 1178 a comet was ſucceeded by a moſt rigorous winter, and deſtructive inundations. On the 11th of September, was a dark day, with ſingular appearances of the ſun and moon. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother comet is mentioned in 1179 and a great hail ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>In 1181 appeared a comet, and earthquakes, with an eruption of Etna, marked this period.—At this time Denmark was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt laid deſolate by exceſſive rains, famin and peſtilence, while Germany loſt half of its inhabitants by the plague. Some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance muſt be made for exaggeration in the accounts of the more deſtructive plagues. This was an age of ſuperſtition, and the imaginations of men were ſuſceptible of ſtrong impreſſions.</p>
                  <p>In 1185 is recorded a moſt violent earthquake, over Europe. Calabria was overturned, and thouſands periſhed. On the Adriatic, a whole city was ſwallowed up, and the ſhock was felt to the Baltic.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="unknown:036687_0129_100AA1795141F800"/>In 1186 Ruſſia and Poland were deſolated by locuſts and peſtilence. The winter was ſo mild, that the following harveſt was in May, and vintage in Auguſt. In Carinthia, the locuſts devoured every green thing.</p>
                  <p>An unuſual conjunction of planets happened, this year, in Libra; and ſo great was the alarm, in that ignorant and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous age, on account of the calamities predicted by aſtrologers, that a ſolemn faſt of three days was appointed by the Archbiſhop of Canterbury. Luckily no uncommon event happened in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, until the next year, when peſtilential diſeaſes prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men and cattle. In 1188 the plague was in Rome.</p>

                  <p>I have no accounts of comets in this period from 1181 to 1211; altho it is probable that ſeveral were viſible.</p>
                  <p>How far may we ſuppoſe the conjunction of all the planets had any influence in producing the remarkably mild winter of 1186?</p>
                  <p>In January 1193 was a remarkable aurora borealis.</p>
                  <p>In 1193 and 4 exceſſive rains injured the grain and produced a dearth. In England an acute peſtilential fever was epidemic and left in health ſcarcely a number of perſons ſufficient to tend the ſick. The uſual forms of burial were neglected, and dead bodies were thrown into graves in piles. A ſevere winter put a ſtop to this epidemic. Brompton, with a natural partiality for religious houſes, informs us that the only places exempted from the deſtruction of this peſtilence, were the monaſteries—Cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary with this diſeaſe was an earthquake and a ſingular fiery appearance in the ſky. Short places this fever under the year 1196 and calls it a "burning ague." See the years 1001 and 1723.</p>

                  <p>The winter of 1200 was cold; the ſummer of 1201 was very rainy; and the winter ſucceeding was ſevere almoſt beyond example. In 1203 was a ſore famin from bad ſeaſons. In 1205 a rigorous winter and a great hail ſtorm; in 1206 an erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heckla; but I have no account of any epidemics that prevailed.</p>

                     <pb n="126" facs="unknown:036687_0130_100AA17AD8F9BCE0"/>In 1210 was an eruption of Heckla, and a cold winter. In 1211 appeared a comet, in May, viſible for 18 days. Great tempeſts marked this period with inundations. In 1212 Venice and Damaſcus were violently agitated by earthquakes, and in Sicily thouſands periſhed by an inundation. Theſe phenomena were the heralds of a ſevere peſtilence, which, in 1213, was ſo fatal in Italy, that authors affirm ſcarcely one tenth of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants ſurvived. In the year following appeared two comets.</p>
                  <p>The year 1219 was diſtinguiſhed for the approach of a large comet, diſtreſſing inundations, in one of which periſhed 36,000 inhabitants, an earthquake and a volcanic eruption in Iceland. In 1220 the plague was ſo fatal in Damietta, that authors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late three perſons only ſurvived out of 70,000. By this we are to underſtand the diſeaſe to have been extremely mortal; but we muſt reject the literal meaning of ſuch relations. It is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs true that the peſtilence of this period has rarely been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in mortality.</p>
                  <p>This period was very calamitous in the north of Europe. In 1221 Poland was afflicted by exceſſive rains, and the floods which followed ſwept away whole villages. The winter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was ſevere, ſo that frozen wine was ſold by weight, while famin and peſtilence almoſt deſolated Europe. In moſt countries, the living could hardly bury the dead; and in ſome cities, ſcarcely a perſon ſurvived.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1222 appeared a comet of unuſual magnitude and the ſummer was exceſſively dry. A froſt, with deep ſnow in April, deſtroyed the fruits. In autumn the earth was deluged with rains and ſwept with violent winds. An earthquake ſhook Germany and Lombardy; in Cyprus two cities were demoliſhed; the ſhocks were frequent and continued for two months, in Brixia, Venice, England and other countries. The plague raged, for three years, with uncontrolable fury, in Germany, Hungary, France and other countries; falling on cattle as well as man.</p>
                  <p>During this dreadful period, the diſcharges of fire and lava, from the volcanoes in Iceland, exceeded what had been before known in the ſame ſpace of time. There were two eruptions in

1222, one from Heckla; the other from Reikeneſe; and the eruptions of the latter were repeated in 1223, 1225 and 1226. In 1224 was a ſevere drouth; in 1225 a rigorous winter, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a dearth, and mortal diſeaſes among ſheep.</p>
                  <p>Let any candid man obſerve the natural phenomena accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying this deſolating period, from 1219 to 1226; and decide for himſelf how far the fire or electricity of the ſyſtem is an agent in producing them, and the attending diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>We obſerve here the progreſs of peſtilence to be the ſame as in modern times. The plague appeared in Egypt almoſt at the ſame time with the comet, and firſt derangement of the elements in 1219 and 1220; but was two, three, four and five years later in the high northern latitudes.</p>
                  <p>No comet is mentioned in the hiſtories of this dark period, as far as I can find, from 1222 to 1240; but that there was one, in the vicinity of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>In 1228 an inundation in Frieſland demoliſhed whole towns, and it was eſtimated that 100,000 people periſhed. Great rains in ſummer and exceſſive heat were followed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In 1230 the waters of the Tyber roſe to the ſtairs of St. Peter's Church, and drowned the lower city. July and Auguſt were exceſſively hot. An inundation of the Danube in 1232, and in 1233 ſo ſevere a froſt, that rivers were converted into highways in Italy; and earthquakes marked the year, with a dark day.</p>
                  <p>During this period from 1230 to 1233, France, Denmark and Italy were waſted by dreadful famin and plague. Theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities continued in 1234 and 5, in England and France. In London alone 20,000 people were ſtarved. Worms and locuſts devoured the fruits of the earth.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1236 was rainy—the following ſummer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely dry, and in England moſt diſtreſſing agues were ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idemic. In 1237 was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland.</p>
                  <p>In 1239 peſtilence again raged—a new ſtar, like Lucifer appeared. Famin was ſo ſevere that perſons fed on human fleſh.</p>

Mortal diſeaſes prevailed, and authors relate that the fiſh, on the Engliſh coaſt <hi>had a battle,</hi> in which eleven whales and a multitude of other fiſh were ſlain and caſt aſhore. The cauſe to which this phenomenon is aſſigned is laughable enough; but the fact is important; for it ſtrengthens modern obſervations, that when peſtilential diſeaſes prevail on the ſurface of the earth, fiſh often periſh beneath the water. Of this no doubt can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; and this alone demonſtrates that the <hi>peſtilential cauſe</hi> is as powerful or nearly ſo, at the bottom of rivers and the ocean, as on the earth—a fact that reduces the theory of propagating the fomes of epidemic diſeaſes in veſſels, clothes and ſimilar articles, from one country to another, to a thing of very trifling conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1240 was very ſevere—the ſnow was deep and cattle periſhed. An eruption of fire in Iceland is noted the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>In 1242 the Thames roſe by means of exceſſive rains and overwhelmed the country for ſix miles about Lambeth. The years 1243 and 4 were remarkable for continued drouth, mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and a moſt fatal plague.—An eruption of fire in Iceland in 1245.</p>
                  <p>In 1247 a violent earthquake was experienced in England, and in September a fatal plague. The earthquake was in Feb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruary and followed by a very rainy ſummer. The winter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing was ſo mild, that people wore their ſummer clothes; but from March to May was cold.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1250 was rainy and tempeſtuous, followed by a hard winter. The ſummer of 1251 was intolerably hot, and epidemic diſeaſes prevailed, with great mortality.</p>

the winter, and ceaſing about the time, in the hot ſeaſon, when that diſeaſe uſually begins.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1254 was rigorouſly cold, a murrain among ſheep was very fatal, and in England and France a mortal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper among horſes called the <hi>evil of the tongue,</hi> but it is not deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>In 1255 appeared a comet; tides roſe to an uncommon height; rivers ſwelled with exceſſive rains and tempeſts levelled buildings. In 1256 the rains and tempeſts were equally violent, and another comet appeared. In 1257 the ſummer was alſo exceſſively rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. From theſe rains came a dearth of corn in England and France in 1258, which was alſo rainy; and famin and diſeaſes made havoc with human life. Fifteen thouſand perſons periſhed by hunger in London; but I have no account that the plague prevailed at that time.</p>
                  <p>To this ſeries of wet ſeaſons ſucceeded ſevere drouth in 1259 and 1260; and the mortality continued till the ſummer of 1259 —after which plenty ſucceeded to want.</p>
                  <p>The year 1261 was rainy in England and Scotland, and a dearth was the conſequence in the following year.</p>
                  <p>In 1262 an eruption of a volcano in Iceland.</p>
                  <p>In 1263 a ſevere froſt in winter converted the Thames into a highway for men and horſes. In 1264 a comet was viſible from June 20th to September 28th and peſtilential diſeaſes ſwept away horſes and cattle.</p>
                  <p>In 1266 ſwarms of Palmer worms devoured all vegetables in Scotland, and ſeveral villages on the Tay and Froth were ſwept away by floods. Theſe were preceded by a remarkable halo.</p>
                  <p>In 1268 appeared a comet, and violent tempeſts and rain are noted, together with ſterility of grain and dearth in Auſtria and Sicily.</p>
                  <p>In 1269 the winter was extremely ſevere; horſes and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages paſſing on the ice over the Thames. A plague raged among the Cruſaders, on their march to the holy land, of which died the French king and his ſon. Some authors mention a comet of ſtupendous magnitude under this date; which is prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the ſame as that noted under the foregoing year.</p>

                  <p>In this year, it is related, the rot among ſheep was firſt known in England. As this was ſaid to be an imported diſeaſe, it is proper to ſtate how it was introduced. Short on Air, vol. 1. 155, ſays, "This year, a rich Frenchman brought into North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland a Spaniſh ewe, as big as a two year old calf, which ſheep being rotten, ſoon infected the country, ſo that the diſeaſe overſpread the whole kingdom, and laſted 25 or 28 years, till it left very few ſheep alive. This was the firſt rot ever known in England."</p>
                  <p>The reader will judge which is the greater calf, the man who gravely tells or the man who believes ſuch a tale as this.</p>
                  <p>Hiſtorians fix upon the year 1277 for the formation of the Dollert Sea, between Groningen and Eaſt-Frieſland, by a great inundation, which overwhelmed 33 villages irrecoverably; with many farm-houſes in the open country.</p>
                  <p>In 1280 a great inundation was followed by a very cold win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In 1281 Poland was afflicted with famin. The winter of 1282 was the ſevereſt then remembered; an earthquake ſhook Italy and a plague raged in Denmark. In 1283 the ſame mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ady prevailed in Scotland. In 1284 the winter was one of the mildeſt ever known; the year was alſo remakable for great tempeſts, an unuſual darkneſs and an eruption of Etna. The year 1285 was noted for a ſimilar darkneſs, moſt parching drouth and the commencement of a famin in England.</p>
                  <p>This drouth was followed in 1286, by the approach of a comet. In this year, Pruſſia was infeſted with a new ſpecies of worms, whoſe ſting was poiſonous. Swarms of flies and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential fevers in Spain nearly deſtroyed the army of the French king, then making war on Arragon.</p>
                  <p>In 1287 fifteen iſlands in Zealand were overwhelmed by an inundation, with the loſs of 15,000 inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>In 1288 the ſummer was exceſſively hot and dry Grain was however abundant in this and the preceding year The drouth was followed by great mortality and a ſevere winter.</p>

A ſevere drouth exhauſted all the ſprings and rivers, graſs withered and cattle were fed on ſtraw. The winter of 1293-4 was extremely cold, and an eruption of Heckla happened in 1294.</p>
                  <p>In 1295 and 6 many countries were afflicted with famin, and in 1297 the plague prevailed in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>A comet of great magnitude appeared in 1298, or as other authors ſay, in 1299, and others in 1300; whoſe approximation was attended with violent earthquakes in Germany, and other places in 1299, and with an eruption of Heckla in 1300. The year 1298 was noted for a great mortality among the Jews, and multitudes periſhed in the eaſt with various diſeaſes in 1299.</p>
                  <p>In 1305 appeared a comet, attended with fatal peſtilence. A hard winter followed, and the Rhine was covered with ice.</p>
                  <p>In 1311 mount Heckla diſcharged its fiery contents; in 1312 appeared a comet, and a three years famin commenced in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia and Poland, which was exceedingly diſtreſſing. Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like wolves and preyed on human fleſh.</p>
                  <p>In 1314 inceſſant rains deſtroyed the grain; a comet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in December following, and in 1316 raged a deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dyſentery in England, accompanied with an acute fever, which, like the true plague, left ſcarcely ſurvivors to bury the dead.

                  <p>Short has placed its firſt appearance in the ſouth of England in September. But Archbiſhop Parker has placed its origin juſt after Chriſtmas. His words are, "Ea ſtatim poſt nativitatis dominicae celebratum feſtum, ipſa nimirum hyeme et rerum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ad victum neceſſarium copia, cum vix ulla contagionis ſuſpicio oriri mortalibus potuit, incepit."

its appearance, and whether before or after the other forms of this peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>Mezeray relates that in China, the diſeaſe originated from a vapor, which burſt from the earth, was horribly offenſive and conſumed the face of the country through an extent of 200 leagues. This account may be inaccurate, but is not to be wholly rejected. That ſome action of ſubterranean heat was inſtrumental in generating the diſeaſe, is very probable; or at leaſt that ſome phenomena of fire accompanied it, becauſe this ſuppoſition is conſonant to the whole ſeries of modern obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>The peſtilential ſtate of air, in that period, is ſtrongly marked by the appearance of myriads of unuſual and loathſome inſects, not only in China, but in Europe. They are deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>In the Ouſe there was a great inundation juſt before Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion day, and in York began this plague ſpeedily after the flood.</p>

                     </gap>e infallible ſigns of the diſeaſe; but the moſt fatal ſymptom was, the pimples or bliſters ſpread over the whole body. Hemorrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from the mouth, noſe and other parts, indicated a univerſal and ſudden diſorganization of the blood. The patient uſually died in three days or leſs—which denotes the virulence of the poiſon, or rather the activity of the diſeaſe, which deſtroyed the powers of life in half the time, which the bilious plague uſually employs.</p>
                  <p>The peripneumony which was epidemic about the ſame time, appeared in a burning fever, inſatiable thirſt, a black tongue, anxiety and pains about the heart, ſhort breath, a cough with expectoration of a mixed matter, open mouth, raging delirium, fury, red, turbid or black urine, reſtleſſneſs, and watchings,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:036687_0141_100AA18E74A5E7C0"/>
black eruptions, anthraces, buboes, and in ſome, corroding ulcers over the whole body. The diſeaſe uſually terminated the 4th day, ſometimes not till the 7th. The blood was black and thick; but ſometimes greeniſh and watery or yellowiſh.—Veneſection was certain death. The diſeaſe baffled medical ſkill—the only remedies that appeared to relieve, were laxatives early admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtered, cupping and ſcarification, leeches applied to the hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhoids, and inwardly, infuſions of mild, diaphoretic, attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, pectoral vegetables.</p>
                  <p>It will be hereafter proved that malignant pleuriſy and peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony uſually form a part of that ſeries of diſeaſes which always occur during a period of general contagion. When plague and yellow fever occur in <hi>ſummer,</hi> in northern climates, pleuriſy and peripneumony often aſſume, in <hi>winter,</hi> great and even peſtilential violence.</p>
                  <p>This plague was ſo deadly that at leaſt half or two thirds of the human race periſhed in about 8 years. It was moſt fatal in cities, but in no place died leſs than a third of the inhabitants. In many cities periſhed nine out of ten of the people, and many places were wholly depopulated. In London 50,000 dead bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies were buried in one grave yard. In Norwich died about the ſame number. In Venice died 100,000—in Lubec, 90,000— in Florence the ſame number. In the eaſt periſhed twenty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in one year.—In Spain the diſeaſe raged three years and carried off two thirds of the people. Alfonſo 2d. died with it while beſieging Gibraltar.</p>
                  <p>In this fatal period, the apprehenſion of death deſtroyed the value of property. In England, and probably in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, cattle were neglected and they ran at large over the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The corn periſhed in the fields for want of reapers; whole vill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ges were depopulated; and after the malady ceaſed, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of houſes and buildings of all kinds were ſeen mouldering to ruin. A horſe which before had been worth forty ſhillings, after the ſickneſs, ſold for half a mark.</p>
                  <p>Altho in the year preceding there had been a plenty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, yet the neglect of agriculture during the general diſtreſs produced a famin. Such was the loſs of laborers, that the few
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:036687_0142_100AA191234A4958"/>
ſurvivors afterwards demanded exorbitant wages, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England was obliged to interfere, and limit their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and even compel men to labor.—See 23d Edward 3. A. D. 1350. The preamble ſtates, that a great part of the people, eſpecially workmen and ſervants had died of the late peſtilence, and thoſe who ſurvived, ſeeing the neceſſity of men, demanded exceſſive wages.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe was particularly fatal in Denmark—all buſineſs was at a ſtand, towns were deſerted, and all was terror and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. It reached the higheſt northern latitudes; it broke out in Iceland, and was ſo fatal, that the ſettlements there are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not to have ſince recovered their population. It was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>ſorte diod,</hi> black death.</p>
                  <p>In ſome places people attempted to eſcape infection by taking their families on board of veſſels, and putting to ſea; but it was in vain; they were ſeized in every place, without regard to age or ſex.</p>
                  <p>In 1348 the malady ſwept away the Greenland merchants and ſeamen. This diſeaſe alſo, or ſome other cauſe deſtroyed the colony of Danes in that country, for it was extinguiſhed and has never been found or heard of to this day.</p>
                  <p>This peſtilence was remarkably fatal to the monks and regular clergy of all deſcriptions. In one ſociety at Montpeliers, of 140 members died all but 7: About the ſame proportion periſhed in Magdalen Society. In Marſeilles, of 140 not one ſurvived. But a circumſtance related in Knighton's Chronicon deſerves particular notice. At Avignon where the diſeaſe firſt appeared in France, 66 of the Carmelites had died, before the citizens were apprized of the fact; and when it was diſcovered, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port circulated that the brethren had killed each other.</p>
                  <p>An important conſequence reſults from the fact—that this plague firſt appeared in a monaſtery, which might be crouded with lazy, idle, filthy monks; in a city not commercial, nor a ſea port. There was no idea of any imported infection; but there muſt have been ſtrong <hi>local</hi> cauſes, which firſt excited into action the general contagion which, at that time, pervaded the atmoſphere over the whole globe.</p>
                  <p>Such was the havoc made by this peſtilence among the clergy
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:036687_0143_100AA193B0819270"/>
in England, ſays Knighton, that a vicarage which before the plague, might have been ſupplied for four or five marks a year, or two marks and the man's board, was raiſed to the price of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty marks or twenty pounds.</p>

                  <p>This peſtilential period was preceded and attended with all the uſual phenomena of fatal Epidemics.<note n="*" place="bottom">Except eruptions of volcanoes, of which I have no account, at this period except in Iceland in 1340. But my accounts of volcanoes are very imperfect.</note> The earthquakes and the inſects have been noticed. Abortions were among the remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble precurſors of this malady. The ſame fact is noticed by Diemerbroeck, before the great plague at Nimeguen, in 1635. The ſame has been mentioned by the authors he quoted, Foreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Sennertes, and others; and is aſcribed to the tenderneſs and debility of the heart and Viſcera. Hence pregnant women firſt feel the effects of a ſtate of air unfriendly to the ſupport of life, and if they are ſeized with plague, are always its victims.</p>
                  <p>Another phenomenon attending this plague was the <hi>death of fiſh.</hi> This circumſtance, with the bad ſtate of the water, which is often affected by the peſtilential ſtate of the elements, and was greatly affected in this period, gave riſe to a report that the Jews had poiſoned the wells and ſprings. The prejudices againſt the Jews, which have marked and ſcandalized all chriſtian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, except America, were at their height in the reign of Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the 3d of England, the period under conſideration. Theſe prejudices drove legiſlators and princes to exerciſe every ſpecies of cruelty upon the Iſraelites, on account of their uſury; and when the report of their poiſoning the water circulated, the pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulace in ſome places and eſpecially in Germany, roſe and aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated multitudes of theſe unfortunate men.</p>
                  <p>The death of animals, particularly of ſheep, marked the ſame period. In England, 5000 died in one paſture. The ſtate of the air and water was ſo peſtilential that it is averred by hiſtorians, the fowls and fiſhes had blotches on them.</p>

                  <p>Guido, an inhabitant of Avignon, when this malady appeared, and who eſcaped death by the favorable proceſs of a bubo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates a fact that throws light on this ſubject. He ſays that the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ady was of two kinds—"the firſt, and <hi>which preceded the other about two mouths,</hi> was a fever, with ſpitring of blood," not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that which prevailed in the time of Fracaſtorius. All who were ſeized with theſe ſymptoms, died in three days.</p>
                  <p>The other kind, which ſucceeded the firſt, came on with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued fever, carbuncles and abſceſſes, in the glands.—This was as fatal as the other, except near its decline, and the patient died in five days.</p>

                  <p>It is remarkable, that the diſeaſe which is technically called <hi>plague,</hi> peſtis, is always preceded by a ſimilar fever. It is in fact the <hi>plague in its firſt ſtages,</hi> tho it does not exhibit the gland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular ſwellings, which modern phyſicians contend are characteriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic of true plague, and mark a generic or at leaſt a ſpecific differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between that and any other kind of typhus fever. This fact of a <hi>progreſſiveneſs</hi> in the diſeaſe, annihilates the favorite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deducing all plagues from infection; a notion which is bandied about between phyſicians and legiſlators like a tennis ball, tho unhappily for mankind, infinitely leſs harmleſs.</p>
                  <p>At the cloſe of this dreadful period, in 1350, were ſevere earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes in Italy. In 1356 a violent ſhock in Switzerland, and in Germany, eſpecially on the Rhine, which did great injury. To this ſucceeded moſt violent rains, and famin and peſtilence in Germany, with prodigious mortality.</p>

                  <p>In 1352 authors relate that 900,000 people in China periſhed by famin.</p>
                  <p>The rainy and humid ſeaſons which introduced the great peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of 1347-50, were ſucceeded by drouth in 1350, a comet in 1351, with tremendous ſtorms, and a meteor which burſt
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:036687_0145_100AA1976EA1C268"/>
with a heavy report. The winter following was ſevere, and in 1354 Africa and Cyprus were devoured by locuſts.</p>
                  <p>In England prevailed epidemic madneſs in 1355.</p>
                  <p>In 1358 was a ſevere winter, followed by an eruption in Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and a waſting plague in Italy in 1359. According to Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace, Florence loſt 100,000 citizens, and Petrarch ſays, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ten of a thouſand ſurvived. There was a great mortality partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly among child-bed women, and cattle did not eſcape.</p>
                  <p>This peſtilence alſo became nearly general. In 1361 Milan, which had eſcaped in 1348, was ſeverely afflicted, as was all France, England and Ireland, and it was computed that Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land loſt one third of its inhabitants. This plague was called the <hi>ſecond</hi> in the reign of Edward III, and it was in time of peace.</p>
                  <p>In this peſtilential time, occurred a remarkable ſtorm of hail and ſnow, in April 1360. The tendency of the elements in ſuch periods to generate hail and ſnow, is a fact that well deſerves conſideration.</p>
                  <p>In January 1361, a violent tempeſt ſpread deſolation over Europe. The winter was ſevere, and the ſummer dry. In March 1362 appeared a comet in the North Eaſt, with a vaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, and an eruption in Iceland. A dearth and diſeaſes among cattle followed.</p>
                  <p>This laſt peſtilence differed from that in 1348, in two or three particulars. It raged with moſt violence, on mountainous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, where the air was pure, and where the plague of 1348 did not prevail. It attacked the nobility and gentry with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than the poor; contrary to the uſual fact; whereas the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of 1348 was moſt fatal to perſons in the humbler walks of life.</p>

                  <p>The comet and volcano of 1362 were followed in 1363 by a winter of extraordinary ſeverity, which laſted from September to April. The Rhine was covered with ice for ten weeks.</p>
                  <p>The year 1365 was rainy, and the plague carried off 20,000 people in Cologne, and the vicinity. In 1366 an eruption in Iceland deſtroyed 70 farms. The ſame year was very ſickly in England and deaths ſudden.</p>

In this year commenced in England the third great plague in the reign of Edward III.; the reader will note that this was preceded by a ſickly year in 1366.

                  <p>In 1374 alſo was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland. There was alſo famin, a violent plague in Italy and ſome parts of France. In 1371 there had been a ſevere earthquake in the ſouth of France.</p>

                  <p>In 1381 and 2 conſiderable earthquakes were felt in England, and a ſevere peſtilence appeared at Avignon in France, which raged for four or five years, depopulating many cities.

                  <p>There was an eruption of Etna in 1381, and the year cloſed with great rains. The year 1382 was without winds. The plague was moſt fatal to children, and great ravages were made alſo among the friars. In this peſtilence Lubec loſt 90,000 people.</p>

of a volcano in Iceland. In modern days, we obſerve the ſame train of phenomena, evidently depending on one general cauſe. In 1389 appeared a ſingular meteor or light in the heavens.</p>
                  <p>The year 1389 was remarkable for the death of children in all parts of England. From the phenomena that attended and the diſeaſes which followed, compared with the order of diſeaſes in modern days, it appears very probable that this diſeaſe was a ſpecies of Angina, which almoſt invariably precedes the plague. In the next year, a deadly plague raged in the north of England. Swarms of gnats and flies marked this period, and ſome parts of the continent were overrun with locuſts.</p>

                  <p>The reader will remark the exceſſive drouth preceding the eruption in Iceland and the fiery appearance in the heavens in the year of the tempeſt. In theſe phenomena, nature is nearly uniform.</p>
                  <p>It is a very common event that dyſentery of a malignant type ſucceeds the plague. Such was the caſe in England, in 1391, when this diſeaſe was epidemic and very mortal. A dearth of corn might have contributed to the ſame event; but it is often the fact, without any ſcarcity of food.</p>
                  <p>An uncommon redneſs of the ſun is mentioned in July of 1391, and for ſix weeks after, thick vapor or clouds.

                  <p>In 1411 the dyſentery carried off 14000 people in Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, but I have no account of the ſeaſons. The plague ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Aquitain and Gaſcoigne with great mortality. In 1412, there were uncommon tides in the Thames. In 1414 a comet, and in 1416 an eruption of fire from a volcano in Iceland, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by great ſnow.</p>
                  <p>In 1421, according to ſome authors, happened the dreadful inundation in Holland, which formed the Zuyder Sea. In 1422 there was an eruption of fire in Iceland, and a ſevere winter followed. The ſame year, the plague raged in Poland.

                  <p>In 1430 happened a general earthquake—in 1432 a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation in Germany—in 1433 a comet was viſible for three months, in the ſouth, and the winter following was terribly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere.

                  <p>In 1438 and 9 violent ſtorms and great rains injured the corn and a dearth enſued. A comet in 1439 and a hard winter followed.

                  <p>In 1443 Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland were terribly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by an earthquake. In 1444 there was eruption of Etna and Lipari, and the exploſion was repeated in 1446 and 7. An epidemic prevailed in 1445, which ſuddenly ended life, but it is not deſcribed. In January 1449 was ſeen a comet. This year the plague raged in Italy and in 1450 famin and plague. In Milan periſhed 60,000 people.</p>

                  <p>This plague of 1450 is ſaid to have ariſen in Aſia, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſpread over Italy, Germany, France and Spain, leaving alive ſcarcely a third of the human race.</p>
                  <p>In 1455 appeared a comet and another in 1456. In this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter year, Italy was violently ſhaken by an earthquake, and 40,000 people periſhed.—Piſtorius places the earthquake in 1457, and ſays it demoliſhed 40 towns, and deſtroyed 60,000 lives. In 1459 a plague began in July and raged ſix months in Italy.</p>

                     <pb n="146" facs="unknown:036687_0150_100AA1A235FF70C8"/>It will be obſerved, in this period and in many others, that the plague is not mentioned under the year of the earthquake. Modern obſervations explain the progreſs of peſtilence, which is moſt uſual, viz. meaſles, catarrh, angina, and other malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant complaints <hi>preceding</hi> the criſis of the peſtilential ſtate of air, or plague. And we find almoſt invariably ſome of theſe diſeaſes to be epidemic, even <hi>before</hi> the comet, earthquakes and erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of volcanoes, altho the moſt violent form of the peſtilence does not always appear till a year or two <hi>after</hi> thoſe phenomena. There is alſo a difference, in the times of the appearance of the plague in various countries. In Egypt, the peſtilence uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears firſt, and is cotemporary with the comet, or nearly ſo; and the ſame year, when the plague rages in Egypt, we find an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginas and other malignant diſeaſes prevailing in Europe and America, in northern latitudes. This difference in time evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the power of local cauſes, in aiding the progreſs of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic conſtitution of air, and which produce the moſt violent diſeaſes in Egypt, one, two or three years, previous to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in cooler latitudes. But it will almoſt always be found true, that the commencement of a ſeries of epidemics is nearly at the ſame time in all parts of the world; the precurſors of the plague being nearly cotemporary in different countries; altho the peſtilential conſtitution or general contagion arrives to its criſis much ſooner in Egypt, Smyrna and Conſtantinople, than in places leſs expoſed to the influence of local cauſes of diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>In 1465 peſtilence again appeared in Italy, but I have no particulars. In 1467 a comet, and a <hi>mild winter</hi> is recorded; a remarkable fact, and the ſecond inſtance I have found in hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. Indeed ſo uniform are hard winters during the approach of comets, that the accounts of exceptions are to be ſuſpected of inaccuracy in point of time.</p>
                  <p>In 1468 a moſt deadly plague raged in Parma of which Short gives a particular deſcription from Rolandus Capellatus.</p>
                  <bibl>Short, vol. 1. 194. Muratori, vol. 13. Edit. Milan. Piſtorius, Germ. Script. vol. 2.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1471 the winter was rigorous and ſtormy. In 1472 ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared three comets; two of them of diſtinguiſhed magnitude. In 1473 moſt exceſſive heat and drouth, and authors relate that
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:036687_0151_100AA1A46E117CD0"/>
the woods took fire by the heat of the ſun. This drouth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued three years—all ſmall rivers were dried up—the Danube was fordable in Hungary. In 1475 and 1476 appeared thoſe enormous ſwarms of locuſts, which always denote a ſtate of air highly peſtilential, and ravaged Hungary and Poland. In 1474 earthquakes were felt in Germany. In 1475 an eruption of a volcano in Iceland.</p>
                  <p>Theſe phenomena, in this period, as uſual, introduced moſt terrible peſtilence, which began in 1472 and arrived to its height in 1477. It raged in Italy, Germany, France and England, and how much more extenſively, my authorities do not inform me. It prevailed ſeveral years, with incredible mortality. In Paris periſhed 40,000; a large number for the population at that time. In England the number of deaths was not eſtimated; but authors relate that fifteen years of civil war did not carry off one third of the number. This year 1477 was exceſſively hot. In 1478 innumerable locuſts overran Italy.</p>
                  <p>In 1478 and 9 the plague in England repeated its ravages; beginning like that of 1348, in autumn, raging through the winter until the next autumn.</p>

                  <p>Sir Thomas More, in a letter to Eraſmus, declares this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in London, Oxford and Cambridge to have been more dangerous than a battle. "Minus periculi in acie, quam in urbe eſſe."</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1485 was exceſſively rainy, and an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Severn made great havoc with men and cattle.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe attacked perſons ſuddenly, with a ſenſation like that of hot vapor running through the part affected. To this ſucceeded internal heat, unquenchable thirſt, and profuſe ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which often carried off the patient in two or three hours. The violence of the attack was paſt in 15 hours, and in 24 hours the patient was conſidered to be out of danger. It was moſt fatal to perſons in high health and eaſy condition of life. It was attended with moſt of the ſymptoms which characterize the plague—anxiety, reſtleſſneſs, violent pain in the head, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium and exceſſive drowſineſs.</p>

                  <p>This was a peſtilential period, for the plague infeſted Italy and Germany in 1483, and Denmark in 1484. And it will be found on examination, that when the ſweating ſickneſs raged in any part of Europe, that or ſome other peſtilential diſeaſe, was in other countries. During the prevalence of this form of the plague in England, at this period, Denmark loſt nearly one half of its inhabitants by the common plague; which raged ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly for two years</p>
                  <p>The author of the Traitè de la Peſte, page 23, remarks, "That until the 15th century the plague exhibited the ſame character; but then "its accidents degenerated," or rather it

reigned a new malady, which, under different external appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, committed ſimilar deſtruction on the human body. It did not any longer ſhow itſelf by buboes, carbuncles and pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; nor by any of the eruptions which the heat of the viſcera puſhes out; nor was the ſkin withered by the parching dryneſs which accompanies the carbuncular ſpots; on the other hand, the ſkin was inundated by torrents of ſweat, which ſeemed to be po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>About the middle of the 16th century, the plague reſumed its former character, but the ſymptoms ſomewhat varied and lighter."</p>
                  <p>The ſweating plague at firſt attacked none but Engliſhmen. Even Scotchmen eſcaped, in foreign countries, where Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ſeized. Foreigners in England eſcaped. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was on its firſt invaſion in 1485—for, in ſubſequent years, it ſpread over other countries. But the fact of its ſeizing only Engliſhmen at firſt, is preciſely analagous to what has happened on many other occaſions, in other countries. It recurred in England in 1506, 1518, 1528 and 1551.</p>
                  <p>In 1491 appeared a comet, the ſeaſon was very wet, an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic ſwept away cattle, and a famin afflicted Ireland. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere winter is noted in 1493.</p>

                  <p>In 1511 appeared a comet; another in 1512 and a third in 1513. In 1511 the plague prevailed in Verona, and in 1513 a
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:036687_0156_100AA1AF2C4311E8"/>
malignant fever or dyſentery, which covered the body with black ſpots. Bleeding was pernicious; cupping and actual cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery were ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>In 1514 cats periſhed by an epidemic peſtilential diſeaſe, ſays Fernelius; and the plague was in Tournay; while a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſtemper raged among the cattle in England.</p>
                  <p>In 1515 a malignant catarrh or throat diſtemper in Holland ſeized perſons ſuddenly, and if not cured, in a few hours, fell on the lungs and terminated in death in one day. In this year and the next appeared comets, and Germany ſuffered univerſally by inundations.</p>
                  <p>To theſe diſaſters ſucceeded a ſevere winter in 1517, followed by a very hot ſummer. Corn was in great abundance, but the ſweating plague made great havoc in London, and ſo malignant a murrain raged among cattle, that ravens and dogs which fed on their carcaſes, ſwelled and died.</p>
                  <p>This deadly ſweating plague was preceded, in the ſpring of the year, by an epidemic inflammation of the throat, ſo virulent as to deſtroy life in a few hours. The malignity of this diſeaſe has rarely, if ever been equalled in modern times. It ſeems to have been merged in the ſweating plague, about midſummer. Authors relate that half the people of England periſhed with theſe diſeaſes.—The diſeaſe in the throat ſeems to have been of an inflammatory diatheſis, as early bleeding and purging were the only ſucceſsful remedies.</p>

England ſuffered by dearth and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in 1522 the plague viſited Munſter in Ireland, and the continent.—The winter following was diſtreſſingly ſevere.</p>
                  <p>Peſtilential fevers prevailed in 1524 and 5. The mortality in London alarmed the people, and the terms were on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, adjourned. In 1527 appeared a comet, and one in each year, for ſix years in ſucceſſion. In 1527, the wetneſs of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

injured the grain, a ſevere famin enſued, and many of the poor were ſtarved to death. This year is noted for a great hail ſtorm in Italy.</p>
                  <p>In 1528 the ſpotted fever, that almoſt infallible precurſor or companion of the plague, broke out in all parts of Europe; the plague in Italy, and the ſweating diſeaſe in London with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mortality, terminating in death in ſix or ſeven hours. The ſame diſeaſe prevailed in Cork.</p>
                  <p>In 1529 the ſweating diſeaſe ſeized Amſterdam, raging a few days with great mortality, and paſſing rapidly to other places.</p>
                  <p>In 1530 was an eruption of Etna, and an earthquake in Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon demoliſhed 1400 houſes. In 1531 was another eruption of Etna, the ſweating plague raged in Germany, and peſtilence, in ſome form, was almoſt univerſal.—A great hail ſtorm, the ſame year.</p>

                  <p>Fracaſtor informs us that the petechial fever of 1528 was preceded by a mild winter and ſoutherly rainy weather, together with inundations in ſpring, and unuſual darkneſs. He obſerves, that appearing in many places, it muſt have had a common cauſe.</p>
                  <bibl>De Contagione, p. 160.</bibl>
                  <p>The laſt remark is verified by modern obſervations. The petechial fever is an almoſt infallible forerunner of the plague in the Levant, in Italy and other countries. It may be laid down as an axiom, on this ſubject, that altho the appearance of this fever is not <hi>always</hi> and <hi>certainly</hi> followed by the plague, yet that the plague, in moſt parts of the eaſt, is <hi>always</hi> preceded by a petechial fever.</p>
                  <p>In 1533 there was a volcanic eruption in South America, but I have no account of the diſeaſes of that year.</p>
                  <p>In 1534 the plague was in Narbonne.</p>
                  <p>In 1535 there was a terrible plague in Cork.</p>
                  <p>In 1538 appeared a comet, which was preceded by eruptions of Etna in 1536 and 7 and a hard winter. In 1539 another comet and in 1541 a third.</p>

                  <p>The year 1543 was very wet and cold, and a great mortality among cattle. In 1542 the plague was in Geneva. In 1543 it raged in London in winter. In 1545 there was an eruption of Etna. The plague again raged in Geneva, and all over Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope a peſtilential epidemic, called the Troup Gallant, which ſeized chiefly the young and robuſt, with a mortality nearly equal to that of the true plague, of which it ſeems to have been the precurſor. Patients had a violent pain in the head, heat in the kidneys, univerſal laſſitude, continual watchings ending in frenzy, or drowzineſs ending in lethargy; and worms riſing into the throat, with danger of ſuffocation. Bleeding was the only remedy; then detergents and cordials. The diſeaſe terminated on the 4th or 11th day. Charles, duke of Orleans, died of this diſeaſe at a monaſtery in Abbeville.</p>
                  <p>In 1547 the plague prevailed in moſt parts of Europe, as in Ireland and in Germany; and in 1548 in London.

                  <p>This peſtilential period was long and ſevere. In 1548 the plague was in London. A contagious peripneumony prevailed over Europe, with ſpitting of blood and difficulty of breathing. In 1549 the plague prevailed in Pruſſia and Portugal.</p>
                  <p>In 1550 a comet in March, and the ſame year an eruption of Etna and Lipari. The ſummer was very rainy and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dry. In 1551 the earth was deluged with rain, and infinite damage was done by floods. The catarrh was epidemic in France. An epidemic peſtilential fever raged all over Europe, and the ſweating ſickneſs in London. The plague followed in various parts of Europe. In 1552 it raged in Miſena, and the patient diſcharged blood by the pores for three days before death. In 1553 the ſame diſtemper raged in Paris, with extreme mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and to appeaſe the wrath of heaven, many heretics were burnt.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, peſtilence ſpread over Hungary and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania for two years and ſuſpended the operations of war. This year alſo there was an earthquake from the Elbe to Saxony.</p>

                  <p>In 1554 there was an eruption of fire in Iceland and in the ſame year appeared a comet. In 1555 the ſummer was exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively rainy, and fevers were very mortal in England and France.</p>

                  <p>In 1557 a comet; an inundation of the Tyber; and a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent catarrh was almoſt univerſal. The cough was ſevere, and pain in the ſide, difficulty of breathing and fever attended. In general bleeding the firſt or ſecond day was ſucceſsful; but in a ſmall town near Madrid, bleeding was fatal, and 2000 patients died after veneſection.</p>
                  <p>In Alemar this epidemic aſſumed the form of a ſore throat; 2000 perſons were ſeized almoſt inſtantly in October, of whom 200 died. Foreſtus aſcribes it to a vapor, for it was preceded by thick clouds of an ill ſmell.</p>
                  <p>In 1556 the plague raged in Vienna.</p>
                  <p>In 1557 a violent plague broke out in a ſmall inland village between Delph and the Hague in Holland—an inſtance of its origination at a diſtance from a ſea-port; and it ſpread over the country, in June. This diſeaſe was preceded by meteors in the air, and attended with abortions. Such was the mortality, that the poor fought for coffins for their dead relations. In Delph only, died 5000 of the poor. It continued through the winter to May 1558.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame ſummer peſtilential fevers raged with great mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in France, Holland and other countries.</p>
                  <p>In de Thou's hiſtory of his own times, vol. 2. 227, we have an account of the ſpotted, or petechial fever, which appeared in Spain in 1557, which was nearly as mortal as the inguinal plague. He calls it a "new diſeaſe" and unknown to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. The ſpots differed from the florid pimples of the purple fever. It was putrid, malignant and much reſembling the plague, but "did not carry ſo peſtilent a contagiouſneſs." It <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In 1558 appeared a comet. The ſummer was exceſſively hot and the winter very cold. Dyſenteries raged in France, and in Holland ſemitertians, which affe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Violent tempeſts and inundations are mentioned, this year and the laſt. In 1558 died Charles V. emperor of Germany.</p>

                  <p>In 1562 and 3 the plague ſpread over Europe. It broke out in 1562 among the Engliſh ſoldiers, who were ſent to garriſon New-Haven in France. The next year it raged in London and carried off 20,000 of its inhabitants. Authors ſay, the ſold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers from New-Haven introduced it into London; but who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced it into New-Haven, we are not informed.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, this terrible diſeaſe appeared in moſt parts of Europe about the ſame time. In Frankfort, Nuremberg, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deburgh, Hamburgh, Dantzick, and in the vandalic maritime towns, Wiſmar, Lubick, Roſtock and others, periſhed by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation 300,000 perſons in the year 1563.—This diſeaſe alſo raged in winter, for Thuanus mentions the death of Caſtalion, a literary character of that age, by the plague at Baſle in January.</p>
                  <p>This year was remarkable alſo for earthquakes. In Sept. was a violent one in England, eſpecially in Lincoln and other northern parts. In January the river Thames was agitated by preternatural fluxes of the tides, which forced back the natural tides, three times. In winter, ſevere cold rendered that river paſſable as a highway.</p>
                  <p>The ſame year earthquakes were felt in Illyrica, and Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, and Catana ſuffered a great loſs of lives.</p>
                  <p>In 1564 a comet appeared, and remarkable northern lights, or meteors, and a deſtructive inundation of the Thames.</p>

                  <p>In 1566 the ſpring was rainy and the harveſt dry. The Hungarian fever broke out in the Emperor Maximilian's army, and as authors affirm, the ſoldiers, when diſbanded, ſpread it all over Europe, with great mortality. This diſeaſe invaded the patient at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with ſlight cold and ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering for about fifteen minutes. This was followed by intenſe heat, and intolerable pain in the head, mouth and ſtomach, ſo that the ſlighteſt touch of the bed clothes, made the ſick utter ſhrieks: The pain in the mouth and ſtomach being the pathog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomonic ſymptoms of the diſeaſe.—The thirſt was unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a longing for wine, which was fatal, if taken. The tongue was dry and lips chopt. Delirium came on the third day. A critical looſeneſs and deafneſs were favorable—Swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings behind the ears were frequent. The moſt miſerable criſis was, tubercles on the top of the foot, which, if neglected, ended in mortification. Many ſuffered amputation. Spots, like flea bites, appeared on the body, and if livid or black, they were fatal ſymptoms. Copious bleeding, on the firſt ſeizure, was, of all remedies, the moſt ſucceſsful.</p>

                  <p>In the year 1567 was an eruption of Etna, and in Tercera, one of the Azores, fire burſt from a lake on the top of a hill, and the water releaſed from its bed, ruſhed down and ſwept away part of a ſettlement below. In 1568 a ſpotted fever raged in Paris, in which proſtration of ſtrength rendered bleeding fatal. The winter of 1567 was very ſevere, and the ſummer exceſſively dry.</p>
                  <p>In 1569 appeared a comet.—The ſpotted fever in this year became epidemic in Europe, raging for three years with great deſtruction. The plague was in London. Short remarks that this ſpotted fever "in ſeveral places turned to the plague, and where the plague raged, it turned to this fever."—Indeed this ſpotted fever was a milder form of the peſtilence, raging as it

uſually does, for ſome time, <hi>before</hi> the glandular plague appears. In this period, it was the herald to announce one of the moſt general plagues that Europe ever knew. The petechial fever prevailed principally from 1569 to 1574, interſperſed with the real plague, in a few places; and the real peſtis followed it, with mortal rage, and prevailed for three or four years.</p>
                  <p>In 1570 a moſt dreadful earthquake in Chili, S. America, deſtroyed many villages and buried the inhabitants in their ruins. This is the firſt occaſion I have of introducing America in this hiſtory.</p>
                  <bibl>Ulloa b. 8. ch. 7.</bibl>
                  <p>Thuanus, whoſe authority is very reſpectable, and who was cotemporary with this period, relates that in 1570 the dikes in Holland were broken by a ſwell of the ocean, and that 400,000 people were overwhelmed in the floods. He ſays further that ſimilar phenomena were obſerved, that year, in different places over the whole world. Reggio, Florence, Venice and Modena felt ſevere ſhocks of earthquake in 1571, and Ferara was laid in ruins.</p>
                  <p>The ſummers of 1570 and 71 were moiſt and warm; and in gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al the ſeaſons were ſimilar for the two ſucceeding years. The winters were rigorous. Fluxes, meaſles, worms and ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertians were epidemic in many places. In 1572 appeared a comet or new ſtar, very bright and clear, larger than Jupiter, in the conſtellation of Caſſiopeia, behind her chair. It was ſtationary for 16 months and by degrees evaniſhed. The winter ſucceding was remarkable for hard froſt and deep ſnow. The author of Obſervations de Phyſique et de Medicine, ſays, that all maladies in France in 1572 turned to epilepſy and palſy.</p>
                  <p>This year the plague raged in Poland; and at Baſle a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever, chiefly fatal to men of robuſt conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>In 1574 the petechial fever, which had ſpread mortality over Europe, eſpecially in Italy and Spain, began to change into the uſual form of the plague. This diſeaſe made its appearance in London, in a ſmall degree, in October and November of this year.</p>
                  <p>In 1575 the plague appeared in many parts of Europe, and
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:036687_0164_100AA1BF47ED5F88"/>

                     </gap>ged with incredible mortality for three years. It was reported in Italy to have been <hi>imported</hi> into Verona and Venice, from Trent. Such was the current vulgar opinion. But men of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hold the diſeaſe to be generated in cities from the <hi>filthineſs of private dwellings,</hi> and not to be produced by the poſition of the ſtars or malignant conſtitution of the air.</p>
                  <p>The truth was, the diſeaſe in Italy firſt appeared in Trent, an <hi>inland town, far from the ſea</hi>—another inſtance in which the advocates of importation from Africa or the Levant are ſilenced. Philoſophy diſdains to look abroad for the cauſe of an epidemic, when the ſtrongeſt of all cauſes exiſt in the place. Trent is ſituated in a valley, on the bank of the Adige, a river which often overflows the adjacent low lands; and after the flood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes, the place is ſometimes ſo ſickly that the people are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to retire to the neighboring hills. Strong local cauſes therefore account for the <hi>firſt</hi> appearance of the plague in that city. The general contagion of the atmoſphere, which had produced ſpotted fevers and other deadly diſeaſes all over Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope for four years preceding, was aided by the local unhealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Trent, and here appeared firſt, the criſis of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or plague. See the deſcription of that country in Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merman on Air.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe almoſt depopulated Trent in 1575, and became mortal in the neighboring Venetian territories. This mortality however was only the forerunner of greater evils. The diſeaſe indeed ſubſided in winter, and the people ſuppoſed its violence to be paſt. They might have known otherwiſe, had they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>progreſſiveneſs</hi> of the malady, and the certain indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of its increaſe.</p>
                  <p>In 1576 the diſeaſe appeared in Venice; and as it carried off a few people at firſt, in ſcattered ſituations, opinions were, as uſual in all ſuch caſes, divided as to the nature of the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. In this ſtate of the public mind, two eminent phyſicians, Mercuriale of Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>li, and Capavacca of Padua, undertook to aſſert the diſeaſe not to be peſtilential. The ſenate, obſerving the controverſy among the Venetian phyſicians, as to the nature of the diſtemper, liſtened to the two foreigners, who declared
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:036687_0165_100AA1C1615C40B0"/>
they could cure it, and put a ſtop to the removal of the diſeaſed from the city. By this means, ſays the hiſtorian, the diſtemper was obviouſly increaſed; and it raged with terrible fury, till it carried off 70,000 of the citizens, with fifty-ſeven valuable phyſicians and ſurgeons. The two foreign phyſicians were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, with applauſes for having preferred the good of Venice to their perſonal ſafety.</p>
                  <p>This account from Thuanus deſerves particular notice. We here ſee the ſame doubts about the nature of the diſeaſe on its firſt appearance, which prevail in all ſimilar caſes—as in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles in 1720—in London in 1665—and in America, with reſpect to the yellow fever, which is only another form of plague. The ſource of all theſe doubts and controverſies, which have ſo often embarraſſed the citizens and diſgraced the faculty, is, the <hi>progreſſiveneſs</hi> of the peſtilence. The malignant diſeaſes preceding, ſlide into the glandular plague ſo gradually, that phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians themſelves do not know preciſely when the diſtemper ſhould loſe the name of <hi>malignant fever</hi> and take that of <hi>plague.</hi> Sydenham honeſtly confeſſes that, in 1665, he did not know whether the malignant diſeaſe which appeared in May and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came epidemic, juſt before the plague, was the real plague or not. And the truth is, that the diſeaſe often aſſails people, in a few ſcattering caſes, at the beginning of a plague, with a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality equal to the true peſtis, and <hi>without</hi> the diſtinctive marks of plague, the glandular tumors.</p>
                  <p>Theſe facts will hereafter, with careful obſervation, obviate all controverſies at the beginning of peſtilential diſeaſes; and they will decide infallibly all queſtions relative to the domeſtic or foreign origin of ſuch maladies.</p>
                  <p>This peſtilence was ſeverely felt in Padua, Milan, Cremona and Pavia. Vicenza, which eſcaped this year, was viſited the next, with equal ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Mead is puzzled to know why Vicenza, which lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Verona and Padua, ſhould eſcape the plague, in the year when both thoſe cities were infeſted; and yet the next year, ſhould ſuffer equally with her neighbors, when <hi>they</hi> were exempt from the calamity. He finds ſome difficulty in accounting for
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:036687_0166_100AA1C3E710E290"/>
the conveyance of the <hi>infection</hi> from one to another, without communicating it to the intervening city. This ſubject will be conſidered in a ſubſequent ſection; I will only here remark, that nothing is ſo fatal to truth and ſcience, as for a man of popular talents to eſpouſe an erroneous theory, and then ſtrive to bend facts to its ſupport.</p>

                  <p>In the great peſtilence of the preceding ten years, not only Europe, but Aſia was laid waſte. So general and ſevere was the diſeaſe that the operations of war, in the Turkiſh empire, were ſuſpended. Meſſina in Sicily loſt 40,000 inhabitants—and Europe muſt have loſt in ten years, by the peſtilence under the various forms it aſſumed, one third, or more probably one half her people.</p>
                  <p>In this period we ſee all the extraordinary operations of nature united. Comets, earthquakes, in Europe and S. America tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, volcanoes, unuſual animals, exceſſive floods from rain or an extraordinary intumeſcence of the ocean all mark an extreme agit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or diſorder of the elements.—The vaſt comet of 1577, the year when the plague was at its height, was calculated to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach within 840,000 miles of the earth. Upon the Newton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian principles of the power of attraction, the influence of that body on the earth muſt have been prodigious.</p>

                  <p>In this year appeared in Moravia a new diſeaſe, evidently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in its ſymptoms from any known malady, and which Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus has deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>This alſo was the year in which a ſudden diſeaſe ſeized the court and attendants at the Oxford aſſizes in England. Early in July, while the court was ſitting, "there aroſe, ſays Stowe, amidſt the people ſuch a damp that almoſt all were ſmothered—
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:036687_0167_100AA1C6E1356B48"/>
very few eſcaped, that were not taken at that inſtant. The ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors died preſently—after which Robert Bell, Lord Chief Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. There died in Oxford 300 perſons—and ſickened there, but died elſewhere, more than 200 from the 6th to the 12th of July. After which died not one of that ſickneſs, for one of them infected not another, nor died thereof any one woman or child."</p>

                     </gap>o a damp or vapor. But there is no need of reſorting to ſuch a cauſe. The atmoſphere, during the period under conſideration, was not furniſhed with the power of ſupporting animal life, in as ample a manner as it uſually is.—This is evident, from the univerſality of mortal epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics. In this ſtate of the atmoſphere, a multitude, crouded into a court room, in the hot month of July, muſt ſpeedily deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy all the reſpirable air, and death muſt enſue. That the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe was not only local, but ſudden, is demonſtrated by the circumſtance, that no infection accompanied the diſeaſed. Had the cauſe of their illneſs been long in operation, it would have produced in the body that ſpecies of poiſon, which is nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to perſons in health. Perſons, ſuddenly deprived of life, as by damps in wells or the fumes of charcoal, communicate no infection.</p>
                  <p>It is ſuggeſted by ſome writers, that this diſeaſe was occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an infected priſoner, who was brought from jail into court; but Stowe does not mention this circumſtance. And it is poſſible the cataſtrophe might have been owing to a ſudden diſcharge of mephitic vapor.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had the laſt period of peſtilence come to a cloſe, when another ſeries of maladies ſucceeded, and nearly in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thoſe laſt deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>In 1580 appeared a comet on the 10th of October which was viſible for two months. The preceding ſummer was very moiſt and rainy, and about the riſing of the dog-ſtar, came on a cold dry north wind. In June began an epidemic catarrh in Sicily, which ſpread over Europe. In July, it was in Italy; in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, in Venice and Conſtantinople; in September, it extended over Hungary, Bohemia and Saxony; in October, on the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic;
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:036687_0168_100AA1C86CAF0E70"/>
in November, in Norway and in December, in Sweden, Poland and Ruſſia.—Its ſymptoms were nearly the ſame, as in this country, but the diſeaſe was more violent and fatal.—In Rome, died of it 4000 people—in Lubec, 8000; at Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, 3000; and multitudes in other places. It appears to have been attended with more fever than in ordinary caſes—The fever was continual for four or five days, with a pain in the head, ſtraitneſs of the breaſt and cough—it terminated in profuſe ſweating.—In general bleeding and purging were found to be prejudicial.</p>
                  <bibl>Riverius, lib. 17.</bibl>
                  <p>In this year and about the time, when the catarrh had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread Europe, broke out in Grand Cairo, one of the moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olating plagues ever known. Proſper Alpinus, who lived in that age, reports the number of deaths, from November 1580, to July 1581 to have been 500,000. It will be found on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination that the plague, in a ſeries of peſtilential and epidemic diſeaſes, appears in Egypt, <hi>before</hi> it does in Europe and Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, and is nearly cotemporary with the catarrh, angina or other precurſor of the peſtilence in more northern latitudes. This fact deſerves notice. The plague which followed the catarrh in Europe, did not appear in many places, perhaps in none except in France, in the year 1580.—In northern latitudes, the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the epidemic conſtitution does not appear, till the ſecond or third year, after its commencement in catarrh or meaſles.</p>
                  <p>In Paris however the plague raged in 1580, the ſame year it appeared in Egypt, and carried off 40,000 people, moſtly of the poorer ſort; and at the ſame time, it prevailed in many of the neighboring towns, eſpecially, ſays Thuanus, "at Laon in Vermandois, which city is in a poſition expoſed to a hot ſun, in which died 6000."</p>
                  <p>The hiſtorian further remarks, that the "crops that year were plentiful, and the ſky ſerene; ſo that it was thought the diſeaſe was produced rather by the influence of the ſtars, ab aſtrorum impreſſione, than by the malignity of a corrupt air." This is another proof that a ſtate of air, as deſcribed by Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, is not always the cauſe of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="unknown:036687_0169_100AA1CCA6F24A88"/>Altho this malady broke out in France in 1580, yet it had been preceeded by the catarrh. The hiſtorian remarks, that the catarrh was not ſo much dreaded for its mortality, tho many died of it, as for the aſtoniſhing rapidity with which the contagion ſpread from place to place. It ſeized the lower ſpine of the back with a chill, <hi>horrore;</hi> to this ſucceeded <hi>gravedo,</hi> a dull pain in the head; and univerſal languor or debility, reſolvens membra, looſening or unhinging the joints. If the criſis was not favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in five days, the diſeaſe terminated in a fatal fever.</p>

                  <p>In 1580 conſiderable earthquakes were felt in Belgium, at Cologne and about the Mediterranean. The ſame ſhocks were felt in various parts of England, but Short places them under the following year. The German ſea was agitated, and a great ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of its waters was obſerved.</p>
                  <bibl>See Thuanus, lib. 71, 72. Short, vol. 1. p. 260.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1580 alſo, the marſhes in Eſſex, and ſome parts of Kent in England, were laid waſte by mice, which were ſo numerous as to deſtroy the herbage, and a murrain among cattle ſucceeded.</p>
                  <p>In this year was iſſued a proclamation of Queen Elizabeth, upon the repreſentation of the Mayor and Aldermen of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, prohibiting any new houſe to be built within three miles of the gates of the city, and more than one family to reſide in a houſe. The reaſons aſſigned for the prohibition are connected with this ſubject. The increaſe of London had long been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an evil, by ſwelling the head too large for the body, and ſeveral attempts had been made to reſtrain the increaſe. The reſort of people to the city from the country was held to be prejudical to agriculture.</p>
                  <p>But the proclamation ſtates further, that "ſuch great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people, brought to inhabit in ſmall rooms, whereof a great part are very poor, yea ſuch as muſt live by begging, or by worſe means, and they heaped together, and in a ſort, ſmoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with many families of children and ſervants, in one houſe or ſmall tenement, it muſt needs follow, if any plague or popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſickneſs ſhould, by God's permiſſion, enter amongſt thoſe multitudes, that the ſame would not only ſpread itſelf, and invade
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:036687_0170_100AA1CE32054858"/>
the whole city and confines, but a great mortality would enſue the ſame, and the infection be diſperſed through all other parts of the realm."</p>
                  <p>In this paper, we obſerve ſome powerful cauſes of peſtilence in London to be explained—and events ſhowed how little good was done by the interference of authority with private rights, and an attempt to check, by poſitive prohibitions, the natural growth of towns. This proclamation, like all which had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded it, was uſeleſs. The city increaſed, and the plague con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ravage it, until the good providence of God arreſted the evil, by a general conflagration, and men had become wiſe enough, to build large, airy houſes, and keep them clean.</p>

                  <p>In 1583 ſeveral concuſſions of the earth were experienced in England, and the plague appeared in London. At the ſame time it appeared in Germany or Holland; as Diemerbroeck mentions this as a peſtilential year. The following winter was ſevere. In Rome there was a famin.</p>

                  <p>In 1585 in ſpring appeared very malignant pleuriſies. In 1586 Thrace was overrun with locuſts, and the plague raged in Hungary, Auſtria and Turkey. A comet appeared in each of theſe years, and in 1586 Lima in South-America was nearly ruined by an earthquake. See Ulloa, from whom my accounts of earthquakes in Spaniſh America, are all taken.</p>
                  <p>In 1587 a very cold ſpring, but a plentiful year in moſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The plague raged in Flanders, which was almoſt depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by diſeaſe, war and famin. In ſome parts, the wild beaſts took poſſeſſion of the houſes. Dogs ran mad, and did no ſmall miſchief, and fields were covered with weeds and buſhes. The catarrh appeared in England, this year, but how extenſively, I am not informed. An eruption of fire in Iceland is recorded under the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="unknown:036687_0171_100AA1D092CC60C0"/>In 1589 the Engliſh fleet, returned from <hi>Portugal,</hi> with the <hi>Hungarian</hi> fever, ſays Short, and introduced it into England. What an influence have <hi>names,</hi> and what miſchief is done by ignorance and falſe philoſophy! The Hungarian fever! As tho this fever had been a native of a particular ſoil, and tranſplanted from country to country, like a fruit-tree. Names are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways harmleſs. The name, Sudor <hi>Anglicus,</hi> given to the ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plague, becauſe it appeared firſt in England and was at firſt peculiar to Engliſhmen, has led the moderns to ſuppoſe, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe to have been limited to England or to Engliſhmen, altho it repeatedly ſpread over all Europe. In the ſame way, the inſect which injures wheat in America, was ignorantly called the Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian fly, and altho the animal was never known in Germany, yet people believe, that, like yellow fever, it <hi>was imported.</hi> It is thus that ignorance gives currency to an improper name, and the name in turn aſſiſts to propagate and perpetuate an error.</p>
                  <p>The truth, in regard to diſeaſes, is, that they often aſſume peculiar ſymptoms; ſuch as are not uſual. Theſe are not prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly <hi>new</hi> diſeaſes, but modifications of common fever, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the infinite variety of that cauſe of ſickneſs, which I denominate general contagion, and which Sydenham called the Epidemic Conſtitution of the air. This or other cauſes are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually diverſifying the ſymptoms of diſeaſes; ſo that phyſicians are often at a loſs whether to call a diſeaſe by an old or new name. Wherever the peculiar cauſes <hi>firſt</hi> exiſt, there will the peculiar ſymptoms of diſeaſe firſt appear—and when ſimilar cauſes exiſt in other places, the ſame ſymptoms will attend the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>In 1590 multitudes of people periſhed by famin. A comet approached the ſyſtem, the winter was cold, a violent earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake convulſed Hungary, Bohemia and Vienna; near the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter place, the earth emitted an offenſive ſmell. The drouth was extreme. The Azores were ſhaken by an earthquake, and a tempeſt in September threatened to overwhelm them in maſs.</p>
                  <p>In 1591 univerſal catarrh in Europe was a prelude to moſt deſtructive peſtilence. It is ſingular alſo that the plague broke out in Narva and Revel, in Livonia, on the gulf of Finland, in the 59th degree of latitude, and raged through the ſucceeding
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:036687_0172_100AA1D21B081EC8"/>
cold winter. Six thouſand perſons periſhed in Revel. As to its origin, the great Thuanus could not decide whether it was "a belli incommoditatibus, ſive caeli inclementia," from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of war, or intemperature of the air. There could have been no ſuſpicion of a foreign origin.</p>
                  <bibl>Thuanus, lib. 100.</bibl>
                  <p>Cotemporary with the catarrh was a malignant ſpotted fever in Trent. A diſtreſſing famin cauſed a great mortality in Italy.</p>
                  <p>In 1591 the plague began to ſhow itſelf in Italy, but attended with peculiar ſymptoms. A fever, little infectious, ſeized the head, inducing delirium, and in many patients, was attended with fluxes and flatulent bowels. It terminated fatally on the tenth day. The remedy was bleeding "Secta vena capitis, quae in brachio eſt, aliiſque a capite manantibus," ſays Thuanus. It attacked chiefly men between the ages of 30 and 50; but was fatal to few women. It raged in Umbria, Tuſcany, Romagne and Lombardy, ſweeping away, in ſome towns, almoſt every man. From Auguſt to Auguſt, it was computed that 60,000 perſons periſhed.</p>

                  <p>In 1592 the petechial fever ſpread over Florence, with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity that entitled it to the name of plague. It was moſt fatal to the nobles.</p>
                  <p>In England the drouth in this and the former ſummer was extreme. The Thames was fordable at London. The plague appeared in Shropſhire in the weſt, and carried off 18,000 cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens in London. Perſia ſuffered much by an earthquake in the ſame year.</p>

On its firſt appearance, all infected and ſuſpected perſons were removed to a diſtant hoſpital, but without effect. The diſeaſe continued to ſpread—a proof that it was an epidemic. In September, it was ſuppoſed to be extinguiſhed; but in October, it broke out with freſh violence, and the diſeaſed were confined to their houſes—a uſeleſs and pernicious regulation.

                  <p>In 1596 appeared a comet. Violent earthquakes ſhook dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent countries, and ſeveral cities in Japan were ſwallowed up.</p>
                  <p>In 1596 and 7 prevailed in Cologne, Weſtphalia and other parts of Germany, a ſingular diſeaſe, which authors aſcribe to the famin which had preceded. It was a malignant fever, which was attended with convulſions and raving madneſs, or delirium. Sometimes the convulſions were attended with little or no fever. The patient was contracted into a knot or ball by the violence of the convulſions, or extended to full length, like a dead body— ſometimes the extenſion of the body was ſucceeded by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction in the ſame paroxiſm. The particulars reſpecting this diſeaſe do not fall within the plan of this hiſtory, but may be found in Short, vol. 1.</p>
                  <p>In 1597 appeared a comet, and the ſame year the catarrh was again epidemic. Malignant fevers, accompanied with worms in youth, were predominant alſo, and the plague was in Juliers and Geneva. A dearth in England.

                  <p>The ſummers of 1598 and 99 were remarkably dry, and ſwarms of fleas, gnats and flies abounded. Tertians, with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiae, were frequent, and continual fevers which yielded to bleeding and purging, or went off with a bilious diarrhea.— Small-pox and meaſles were alſo epidemic.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſeaſes, as uſual, were the precurſors of a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing plague, which, in the autumn of 1598, raged in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Litchfield, Leiceſter and other places in England. It even broke out in the ſmall towns in Wales and the northern counties, as in Kendal in Cumberland, where died 2500—in Richmond, where died 2200—at Carliſle which loſt 1196 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and at Percrith which loſt 2266.</p>

                  <p>THE year 1600 was remarkable for peſtilence in almoſt every part of Europe. Spain, where the diſeaſe was fatal the year before, was this year almoſt depopulated. There raged throughout Europe, a peſtilential, mortal cholic which deſtroyed the lives of all whom it ſeized, within four days. The patient, as ſoon as he was ſeized, became ſenſeleſs—the hair fell from his head—a livid puſtule aroſe on the noſe, which conſumed it— the extremities became cold and mortified.</p>
                  <p>In Florence a terrible earthquake deſtroyed many buildings.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1600 was very cold. In the ſummer of 160<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> there was a ſevere drouth of four or five months; and a violent dyſentery followed, with double tertians and continual fevers. The plague raged in Portugal, attended with black round worms. At Chriſtmas, there was an earthquake in England. The ſame year there was an earthquake at Arequipa, in Peru, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by an eruption of a volcano.</p>
                  <p>In 1602 a cold and dry ſummer and winter, the catarrh was epidemic, and acute fevers prevalent. Theſe diſeaſes and phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena accompanied a ſeries of calamities in all parts of Europe.</p>
                  <p>The famin that marked this period, for a ſeries of years, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in extent and ſeverity, what had been before recorded. Famins are uſually local; but in the preſent inſtance, there was a failure of crops for ſeveral years, in almoſt every part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; while the plague committed moſt deſolating ravages.</p>
                  <p>In Muſcovy the famin raged for three years at the beginning of the century under conſideration, attended with the plague. Parents devoured their dying children; cats, rats and every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:036687_0176_100AA1DBBB288FD0"/>
thing was uſed to ſuſtain life. All the ties of nature and morality were diſregarded; human fleſh was expoſed to ſale in the open market. The more powerful ſeized their neighbors; fathers and mothers, their children; huſbands, their wives, and offered them for ſale. Multitudes of dead were found, with their mouths filled with ſtraw, and the moſt filthy ſubſtances. Five hundred thouſand perſons were ſuppoſed to periſh in Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy, by famin and peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, the famin in Livonia, and the cold winter of 1602, deſtroyed 30,000 lives. The dead bodies lay in the ſtreets, for want of hands to bury them.</p>
                  <bibl>Thuanus, lib. 135. Encyclopedia, art. Ruſſia.</bibl>
                  <p>At the ſame time, raged a moſt dreadful peſtilence in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, which alſo followed a famin.</p>
                  <p>In England, there was alſo a dearth, and in 1603 periſhed 36,000 in London, of the plague, which was ſaid to be imported from Oſtend.</p>
                  <bibl>Maitland's Hiſt. Lond. Mignot's Hiſt Turkiſh Empire, p. 256.</bibl>
                  <p>Even in this caſe, the report of imported infection into Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don was believed, altho the nation had before their eyes, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to the contrary; for the ſame malady broke out in every part of the kingdom, and had actually prevailed in Cheſter, in the north-weſt corner of England, the year preceding.</p>
                  <p>It is idle to aſcribe the plague to infection, communicated from perſon to perſon, or from clothes to perſons. The diſeaſe, in 1602 was in every part of Europe, and appeared nearly at the ſame time, in the moſt diſtant parts. In this caſe, as in thoſe before related, of 1580 and 1591, it had been preceded by catarrh, and a courſe of malignant fevers. The malignity of the diſeaſe in 1602 reſembled that of 1348—perſons were ſeized with ſpitting of blood, and died in three days.</p>
                  <p>In Auguſt 1603 in Paris died 2000 perſons weekly of the plague. This diſeaſe was attributed to the diet and filth accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated, under a defective police.</p>
                  <bibl>Wraxall, vol. 3. 438.</bibl>
                  <p>Why the filth of Paris did not produce the plague in other ſeaſons, writers have not informed us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="unknown:036687_0177_100AA1DEE28D7580"/>The period under conſideration was remarkable for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of the action of ſubterranean fire. The earthquakes of 1600 and 1601 and the burſting of a volcano in South-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica have been mentioned. In 1603 there was an exploſion of Etna. In 1604 a ſecond eruption in Peru, and a comet.</p>
                  <p>The plague abated, in ſome places, the year following; but London was not free from it for a number of years, and from 1606 to 1609 incluſive the diſtemper carried off from two to four thouſand citizens in each ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>In 1607 commenced an unuſual concurrence of great agitations in the elements, and ſevere peſtilence attended.</p>
                  <p>In this year appeared a comet, and another in 1609. The winter of 1607-8 was the ſevereſt that had been known for an age; boats were built on the Thames. And here for the firſt time, I am able to introduce North-America, into this hiſtory; from which will be derived ſome of the moſt important evidence in regard to the univerſality of the cauſes of peſtilential epidemics.</p>
                  <p>The ſeverity of the winter mentioned was equally great in America, as in Europe. George Popham, and a company of ſettlers under the patent of king James, to the London mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, attempted a ſettlement at Sagadahoc in 1607; but Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the Preſident, died during the winter, and the extreme cold was one of the diſcouragements that contributed to break up the ſettlement.</p>

                  <p>In this ſame year was an eruption of Etna.</p>
                  <p>The comet of this year produced a moſt remarkable tempeſt, with a ſwell of the ocean, that did incredible damage in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. In the latter part of winter, the tempeſt brought in a flood into the Severn, which overflowed the country, near Briſtol, to the extent of ten miles, with a rapidity, that left no time for the people to ſave their effects, and many lives were loſt. The flood roſe above the houſes, where people had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted for ſafety, and overwhelmed them. The loſs of cattle and goods was immenſe.</p>
                  <p>In Somerſetſhire, the inundation laid waſte an extent of 20 miles by 10; overwhelming five towns. So ſudden was the
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:036687_0178_100AA1E1CDAF7AA0"/>
irruption, that laborers were caught in the fields, and were ſeen floating on the timbers of their houſes. In Norfolk, the inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation was not leſs deſtructive.</p>
                  <bibl>Thuanus, lib. 138.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1608 a very malignant dyſentery prevailed.</p>
                  <p>In 1609 the approach of the ſecond comet produced effects equally remarkable with the laſt. The action of ſubterranean fire was extenſive. There was an eruption of Etna, and a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent earthquake at Lima in Peru. The winter was ſo ſevere, as to convert the Thames into a common highway.</p>
                  <p>In this year the plague was augmented in London; and it raged in Alemar and Denmark. In the years 1607 and 8, it had been very mortal in Cork.</p>
                  <p>The peſtilential ſtate of air, at this time, was experienced at ſea. The people on board the fleet under Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers, bound to Virginia, were ſeized with the calenture, a ſpotted peſtilent fever, which, on board of one of the ſhips, was ſo malignant as to be called the plague. Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two dead bodies were thrown out of two ſhips. Was this diſeaſe imported? In the ſame paſſage, the fleet met with a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous ſtorm of four days continuance, and Sir T. Gates was ſhipwrecked on Bermuda.</p>
                  <bibl>Purchas, vol. 4. p. 1733.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1610 the catarrh was again epidemic. In ſome parts of the continent prevailed the Hungarian fever like the plague, and ſevere bilious complaints. A remarkable fiery bow in the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens was obſerved in Hungary; and Conſtantinople was infeſted with clouds of graſs-hoppers, of great ſize, that devoured every green thing. The malignant ſore throat was fatal in Spain, and authors relate that this was its firſt appearance in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>In 1611 the plague carried off 200,000 of the inhabitants of Conſtantinople. It appeared alſo in ſome other places. The ſummers of the three laſt years were very hot and dry.</p>
                  <p>In 1612 appeared a comet. A terrible tempeſt made great havoc with ſhipping—2000 dead bodies of ſailors were found on the coaſt of England, and 1200 on that of Holland. Some towns were injured. In the following year, Provence in France
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:036687_0179_100AA1E373A0CC00"/>
was greatly injured by an inundation; and ſwarms of locuſts ſucceeded, which laid waſte the vegetable kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1612 in England was exceſſively dry, and a malignant fever ſeverely afflicted the nation.</p>
                  <p>In 1613 the plague appeared in detached parts of France, and in Montpelier, a malignant diſeaſe ſo fatal, as to want only the buboes, to prove it the true plague. It was marked with red and livid ſpots, ſwellings behind the ears and carbuncles. One third who were ſeized died.</p>
                  <bibl>Riverius, lib. 17.</bibl>
                  <p>The preceding ſummers, the earth was covered with graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers, and the air filled with clouds of flies.</p>
                  <p>In this year alſo Conſtantinople was ravaged with the plague; and as cats were ſuppoſed to ſpread the infection, the phyſicians, who were moſtly Jews, adviſed the emperor Achmet I. and he accordingly ordered all the cats to be tranſported to a deſert iſland near Scutari.</p>

                  <p>In 1614 the winter was ſevere; there was an eruption of Etna, and an earthquake in the Azores. The heavens appeared, at one time in a flame, and afterwards very dark.</p>
                  <p>This year was remarkable for the moſt univerſal ſmall-pox, and moſt fatal ever known. It laid waſte Alexandria, Crete, Turkey, Calabria, Italy, Venice, Dalmatia, France, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Poland, Flanders and England. The mortality equalled that of the plague. In Perſia alſo it raged, with meaſles.</p>
                  <p>In 1615 the ſeaſons were cold. In 1616 a very hot and dry ſummer—quartan agues epidemic—not a family in Germany eſcaped; but not fatal.</p>
                  <p>In 1617 the ſummer was hot and dry.</p>
                  <p>In 1618 appeared a remarkable comet in November, (Short mentions four) and a town in Rhetia was overwhelmed by an earthquake. Violent tempeſts, inundations and hurricanes are recorded of the ſame year, and in Bermuda, the year following, a ſtorm tore up the ſtrongeſt trees by the roots. In 1619 Heckla diſcharged her fiery contents.</p>
                  <p>In 1618 broke out in Naples a malignant Angina which rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged the place for many years. The plague appeared at Bergen,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:036687_0180_100AA1E554DDDBA0"/>
in Norway, in Denmark and in Grand Cairo. This was the beginning of a very peſtilential period, and here muſt be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the terrible peſtilence which waſted the American Indians, juſt before our anceſtors landed in Maſſachuſetts. As this is one of the moſt remarkable facts in hiſtory, and one that demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the general cauſes of plague to belong to other climates, beſides thoſe of Egypt and the Levant, I have taken great pains to aſcertain the ſpecies of diſeaſe, and the time of its appearance.</p>
                  <p>Capt. Dermer, an Engliſh adventurer, who had arrived in America, in a fiſhing veſſel, a year or two before, paſſed the winter of 1618-19 in Monhiggan, an Indian town on the northern coaſt On the 19th of May 1619 he ſailed along the coaſt, on his way to Virginia, and landed at ſeveral places, where he had been the year before; and he found many Indian towns totally depopulated—in others a few natives remained alive, but "not free of ſickneſs;" "their diſeaſe, the plague, for we might perceive the ſores of ſome that had eſcaped, who deſcribed the ſpots of ſuch as uſually die." Theſe are his words. He found ſome villages, which, in his former viſit, were populous, all deſerted—the Indians "all dead."</p>
                  <bibl>Purchas, vol. 4. 1778.</bibl>
                  <p>Richard Vines, and his companions, who had been ſent by Ferdinando Gorges, to explore the country, wintered among the Indians, during the peſtilence, and remained untouched, the diſeaſe attacking none of the Engliſh. Belknap's Life of Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, American Biography, vol. 1. p. 355, but the year is not ſpecified.</p>
                  <p>Gookin, in his account of the Indians, Hiſtorical Collections, p. 8, places this peſtilence in 1612 and 13, about ſeven or eight years before the Engliſh arrived at Plymouth. But this cannot be accurate, unleſs the diſeaſe began to rage for a number of years previous to 1618. Capt. Dermer's letter in Purchas is deciſive of the time of the principal ſickneſs, and fortunately we have another authority which is indiſputable.</p>
                  <p>A ſermon was preached by Elder Cuſhman at Plymouth, in 1620, juſt after the colony arrived, and ſent to London to be publiſhed. In the Epiſtle Dedicatory which is dated December, 21, 1621, the author has theſe words. "They [the Indians]
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:036687_0181_100AA1E7B3A64270"/>
were very much waſted of late, by a great mortality, that fell amongſt them, <hi>three years ſince,</hi> which, with their own civil diſſentions and bloody wars, hath ſo waſted them, as I think the twentieth perſon is ſcarce left alive."</p>
                  <bibl>Hazard's Collection, vol. 1. p. 148.</bibl>
                  <p>This correſponds alſo with the accounts in Prince's Chronol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy from original manuſcripts. This fixes the time in 1618, preciſely agreeable to Capt. Dermer's account. This was the year of the principal mortality; but like other peſtilential pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, this continued for a number of years; for ſome of the Plymouth ſettlers went to Maſſachuſetts, (now Boſton) in 1622, to purchaſe corn of the natives; and "found among the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, a great ſickneſs, not unlike the plague, if not the ſame." It raged in winter, and affected the Indians only.</p>
                  <bibl>See Purchas 4. 1858. Prince's Chron. 124.</bibl>
                  <p>The time then is fixed. The diſeaſe commenced, or raged with its principal violence in 1618 and through the winter. This was the year of the remarkable comet, when the plague was raging in many parts of the world. So fatal was the peſtilence in America, that the warriors from Narraganſett to Penobſcot, the diſtance to which the diſeaſe ſeems to have been limited, were reduced from 9000 to a few hundreds.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchinſon ſays, 30,000 of the Maſſachuſetts tribe alone were ſuppoſed to be reduced to 300.</note> When our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors arrived in 1620, they found the bones of thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, in many places, unburied.</p>
                  <bibl>Magnalia, book 1. p. 7.</bibl>
                  <p>The kind of diſeaſe is another important queſtion. Dermer ſeems to think it a ſpecies of plague, and he ſaw ſome of the ſores of thoſe who had ſurvived. Hutchinſon, vol. 1. p. 34, 35, ſays ſome have ſuppoſed it to have been the ſmall-pox, but the Indians, who were perfectly acquainted with this diſeaſe, after the Engliſh arrived, always gave a very different account of it, and deſcribed it as a peſtilential putrid fever.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately General Gookin, in the paſſage above cited, has left us a fact, which leaves no doubt as to the nature of the mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ady. His words are— "What the diſeaſe was, which ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:036687_0182_100AA1EB8440AB38"/>
and mortally ſwept them away, I cannot learn. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was ſome peſtilential diſeaſe. I have diſcourſed with ſome old Indians, that were then youths, who ſay, that the <hi>bodies all over were exceeding yellow</hi> (deſcribing it by a yellow garment they ſhowed me) both before they died and afterwards."</p>
                  <p>This account may be relied on for its authenticity and it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the queſtion, that the peſtilence was the true American plague, called yellow fever. If any confirmation of this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were neceſſary, we have it in Prince's Chronology, where it is recorded that this fever produced hemorrhagy from the noſe.</p>
                  <p>At the time Gookin wrote, about forty or fifty years after the ſettlement of New-England, the infectious fevers of autumn were called "peſtilent," and they were frequent in the country, but had not then acquired the appellation of <hi>yellow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <bibl>Winthrop's Journal, p. 51.</bibl>
                  <p>This fever has been frequent among the Indians ſince the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſettled the country. Some inſtances will be hereafter related.</p>
                  <p>The evidence then of the origin of the yellow fever in this country, between the 41ſt and 44th degrees of latitude, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, leaving no room for doubt or controverſy. No intercourſe exiſted, in 1618, between this continent and the Weſt-Indies; nor did a ſingle veſſel paſs between New-England and the iſlands, till twenty years after that peſtilence. Not one of the iſlands was then ſettled, except by the Spaniards, with whom our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors had no commerce. Not an European was among the Indians, except a French ſeaman, who had eſcaped from a wreck a year or two before, and Mr. Vine's men, who arrived di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from England. Theſe men eſcaped the diſeaſe; none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attacked but the Indians; another evidence of the origin of the malady in the country.</p>
                  <p>In Gorges' deſcription of New-England, there is the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account of this peſtilence. " The ſummer after the blazing ſtar, which moved from the eaſt to the weſt, even a little before the Engliſh removed from Holland to Plymouth, in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, there befel a great mortality among the Indians, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that had ever happened in the memory of man, or been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of by tradition, laying waſte the caſt."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="unknown:036687_0183_100AA1ED0BAAADD8"/>The author further remarks that this ſtar was much noted in Europe. In America it was ſeen in the ſouth-weſt, for "thirty ſleeps," as the Indians expreſs themſelves. The deſcription of the comet here given anſwers to that of Riverius, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it as very ſplendid, larger than Venus, moving from the eaſt to the weſt, and viſible from Nov. 27, 1618, till the cloſe of December. This was the time the peſtilence was raging among the Indians. Gorges indeed ſays, it was the ſummer <hi>after</hi> the blazing ſtar. It is true, that the diſeaſe continued not only into 1619, but occurred in autumn for ſome years ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. We hear of it among the Maſſachuſetts Indians in 1622. From this it appears that this was a long and ſevere period of peſtilence, between 1617 and 1623, or a later year; like the preſent period in the United States.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be remarked that in 1618, the ſame year when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in America were falling a prey to this malady, the angina ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligna broke out in the kingdom of Naples, and ſpread mortality over the country, as authors affirm, for eighteen years. This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not underſtood, as affirming the diſeaſe to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly epidemic; but as prevailing at certain times and ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>The ſame deſtructive principle operated in Virginia. Capt. Dermer relates that when he arrived in the Cheſapeek on the 8th of September, "The firſt news ſtruck cold to our hearts, the ſickneſs over the land."<note n="*" place="bottom">Capt. Dermer was probably the firſt Engliſhman that ever paſſed through the rapids between Long-Iſland and the main land, now called Hell-Gate. He deſcribes this paſſage as a cataract, and mentions the difference in times of high water, from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>aſt and weſt.</note> Three hundred of the ſettlers died in 1619.</p>
                  <p>It appears from Purchas that the emigrants to Virginia in 1619, 20 and 21, amounted to 3570, in 42 ſail of ſhips.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Jefferſon allows only 2516 perſons to have arrived in that period.</note> There were 600 ſouls in that colony before theſe arrived, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole number 4170. Of theſe, 349 periſhed in the Indian maſſacre of 1622, which would leave 3821 ſurvivors. But in 1624 no more than 1800 were living. Scanty means of ſubſiſtence might have contributed to this mortality; but moſt of it was in conſequence of fevers, that were probably the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:036687_0184_100AA1EEC6D73498"/>
of the climate, and a very unfavorable ſtate of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere.</p>
                  <p>In 1620 a comet was followed by a cold winter. In England the year was diſtinguiſhed by a violent tempeſt, a preternatural tide, and a very wet ſummer. The Hungarian fever, ſo called, ſpread along the Rhine, and in the next year became infectious. London became ſickly. The year 1621 was remarkable for an epidemic malignant ſmall-pox.</p>

                     </gap>omet is noted, and an earthquake in Italy. In New-England the ſpring was exceſſively dry, from the third week in May to the middle of July.</p>
                  <p>In 1623 the epidemic fevers in Europe became more fatal, as the period of peſtilence approached. This is obvious from the London burials, which ſhow a conſiderable increment. Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, who has written on the epidemic fevers of this period in the ſouth of France, obſerves that the mortality was great, until he began to bleed and purge, when it abated. He refers to the city of Montpelier, where almoſt half died who were ſeized. The diſeaſe was a ſpecies of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>This author concurs with the ancients in aſcribing peſtilence to comets. Speaking of the ſingular ſtar of 1618, he ſays, "Hunc vero Cometam, morborum malignorum et peſtilentium, necnon etiam bellorum, quibus univerſa penè hactenus Europa devaſtata eſt, praeſagium ac prenuntium fuiſſe, credere non alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt."</p>
                  <bibl>De febre peſt. 533. fol.</bibl>
                  <p>The author falls into the error, which has brought into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the opinions of the ancient ſages, in regard to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſtars on man, and the ſtate of the elements. He aſcribes <hi>moral</hi> as well as <hi>phyſical</hi> effects to that influence. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the diſtant orbs to have ſome effect on the air or fire of our ſyſtem, and through that medium to augment or diminiſh the ſtimulus which acts on the human body and of courſe on the paſſions, by the exciting powers; yet any moral effects derived from this ſource, muſt be ſo inconſiderable, or ſo blended with the effects of other cauſes, as intereſt, ambition, love, revenge and the like, that the degree of influence could not be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, nor the effects of one cauſe diſtinguiſhed from thoſe of the
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:036687_0185_100AA1F11A55A360"/>
other. I reject therefore all <hi>moral</hi> effects aſcribed to comets; but the <hi>phyſical</hi> effects are, beyond queſtion, great and extenſive.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſes of this period continued to multiply and grow more malignant in 1624, when the epidemic aſſumed the form of the ſpotted fever. In 1625 this fever turned to the plague, and in 1626 changed back to the ſpotted fever, ſays Lotichius, cited by Short. This is not an unuſual fact.</p>
                  <p>The plague in 1625 ſwept away 35,000 of the citizens of London. It raged at the ſame time in Italy, Denmark and Leyden, and how much more extenſively, I am not informed.</p>
                  <p>In this year another comet was ſeen; ſeveral cities in Spain were overwhelmed by inundations; the winter was ſevere; the ſummer, hot and moiſt weather; and there was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland. It is remarkable alſo that, in this year, a volcano burſt forth in Palma, one of the Canaries, with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent earthquake.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1626 was very hot, and the plague continued its ravages in many parts of Europe, as in Wittemburg and the vicinity; and in Lyons, which loſt 60,000 of its inhabitants. This was the prelude to more general calamity in France; for in the following years the whole country felt the diſtreſſing ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the malady.</p>
                  <p>In 1627 and 8 the ſame diſeaſe prevailed in various other countries, eſpecially in Augſburg after a famin. In 1629 the peſtilence raged in Amſterdam. In 1630 Cambridge in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was viſited. It was a very ſickly ſummer in London, ſo that the citizens were alarmed and many retired to the country; but finding the country very ſickly, they returned.</p>
                  <p>In 1629 Pola, a town in the Venetian territories, loſt 7000 inhabitants by an earthquake.</p>
                  <p>Of the peſtilence in this period, there was hardly a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Particular countries enjoyed ſhort intervals of health; but Europe and America were ſeverely annoyed by peſtilential diſeaſes between 1632 and 1637.</p>
                  <p>In 1630 happened great exploſions of ſubterranean fire. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulia loſt 17,000 people by an earthquake; and Lima, in South-America,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:036687_0186_100AA1F4202D7128"/>
was laid in ruins by the like cataſtrophe. At this time the plague prevailed in Vienna.</p>
                  <p>In 1631 happened a memorable earthquake in Naples, with a tremendous eruption of Veſuvius, which continued or was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in 1632. In this eruption, Baglivus aſſures us, Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius loſt 240 feet of its altitude.</p>
                  <p>Cotemporary with theſe diſcharges of fire and lava, was an eryſipelous fever in Europe with inflammation in the jaws, and an increaſe of mortality, antecedent to a general plague. See the bills of mortality for London, Augſburg and Dreſden, where the progreſs of the malignity in the epidemics, is diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marked, by an augmentation of the bills, till the plague in 1636.</p>
                  <p>In 1633 appeared a comet, which was followed by a ſevere winter. The ſame winter in America was mild, ſays Winthrop, p. 61. Southerly winds prevailed till the cloſe of winter, when there were great ſnows. It is very common that ſevere cold is progreſſive, happening in Europe one year before it does in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, as will hereafter appear.</p>
                  <p>In 1633 the year of the comet, commenced an eruption of Etna, which continued for four or five years, through this whole peſtilential period. London was ſhaken by an earthquake, and at Halifax in Yorkſhire raged a very malignant fever.</p>
                  <p>In this year alſo a "peſtilent fever," invaded the little colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at Plymouth in Maſſachuſetts, and carried off twenty of their number. This was a great mortality for that ſmall ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It muſt have been occaſioned by a fever of domeſtic ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, as the colony had, at that time, no intercourſe with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign countries, except with England. No ſuſpicion has ever been entertained that the diſeaſe was of foreign origin.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, the Indians were invaded by the ſmall-pox which ſwept them away in multitudes. It ſpread from Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſett to Piſcataqua, and weſtward to Connecticut river.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of this year was remarkable for innumerable large flies, of the ſize of bees, which made the woods reſound with a humming noiſe.</p>
                  <bibl>Hubbard's M. S. p. 131. Winthrop's Journal, 51—56—59—61.</bibl>
                  <p>We have then a remarkable evidence of the extent of a peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:036687_0187_100AA1F66C0EC348"/>
principle in the elements. The ſame ſpecies of diſeaſes appeared, at the ſame time, in Augſburg, Dreſden, London, and in America. Probably the ſame ſpecies prevailed over moſt of Europe; for we hear of them in every part of Holland in the following year. The diſeaſes predominant, previous to the plague, are of the eruptive kind: Such was the caſe in the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent inſtance. In America, the epidemic among the Indians took the form of the ſmall-pox; and altho it is the current opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion that the ſmall-pox is communicated only by contagion, yet my inveſtigations have ſatisfied me that this is a great error. The ſmall-pox is one of the <hi>family of eruptive diſeaſes,</hi> which belong to almoſt every peſtilential period. Before its origin and progreſs had been affected by the art of innoculation, it uſed to be epidemic, in large cities, under that inflammatory condition of the atmoſphere, which originated meaſles, influenza, anginas and plague, and <hi>rarely or never at any other time.</hi> This diſeaſe therefore, tho communicable at any time by infection, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in particular habits without any infecting cauſe ab extra; and is the offspring of that ſtate of the atmoſphere which gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erates other eruptive epidemics.</p>
                  <p>In 1634 the plague ſhowed itſelf at Ratiſbon. The ſummer in America was hotter than uſual, and the following winter was very cold.</p>
                  <p>In 1635 the plague appeared in Leyden and 20,000 inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants periſhed. This year was diſtinguiſhed for an eruption of Veſuvius, violent earthquakes, an inundation in Holſtein which deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>royed 600 people and 50,000 head of cattle, and a terrible tempeſt in America on the 15th of Auguſt O. S. which brot in a remarkable ſwell of the ocean. It will appear hereafter that moſt of the violent ſtorms and hurricanes, which ſweep the earth, happen during or near the time of the diſcharges of great quantities of fire from volcanoes. In this year, Etna and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius were both in a ſtate of eruption. The plague appeared alſo in Mentz and other parts of Germany.</p>
                  <p>In 1636 there was an eruption of Heckla. The peſtilence was general in proportion to this univerſal agitation of the central
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:036687_0188_100AA1F8BA9442F8"/>
fires. In London it prevailed in 1636 after a regular increaſe of previous malignity in diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Of the progreſs of the peſtilence in Holland, and eſpecially in Nimeguen, we have an accurate account in the treatiſe of the able Diemerbroeck, which is by far the moſt learned and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic work on the plague, that I have ſeen. Not that I believe his opinion of the cauſe of the plague; but his view of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is otherwiſe correct and worthy of univerſal attention.</p>
                  <p>In 1635 when the plague appeared in Leyden, the malignant diſeaſes, its precurſors, appeared in various parts of Holland. In Nimeguen, theſe precurſors were meaſles, ſmall-pox, dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the worſt type, but eſpecially the ſpotted fever. The malignity of this fever increaſed, until it <hi>changed into the real plague</hi>—"donec in apertiſſimam peſtem tranſiret," ſays Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broeck.</p>
                  <p>The plague appeared, in a few caſes, in November 1635, but made little progreſs, during the winter. In January appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were more alarming; in March the malady ſpread rapidly and continued to increaſe till autumn. Scarcely a houſe eſcaped; more than half who were ſeized, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ied; and medical aid was baffled. The diſeaſe declined in the following winter, and was extinguiſhed by a ſevere froſt in February 1637.</p>
                  <p>The ſummers of 1636 and 7 were warm, the winds conſtantly from the ſouth and weſt, "cum magnis aeris ſqualoribus," ſays Diemerbroeck.</p>
                  <p>In 1635 a dyſentery prevailed in moſt parts of Germany. In 1636 the eruption from Etna was augmented, and Rome was ſeverely afflicted with the plague. In 1637 the ſame diſtemper raged in ſome parts of Holland, in Denmark, Conſtantinople and Natolia; after which year the diſeaſe declined or diſappeared.</p>
                  <p>This period of diſeaſe was alſo experienced in Virginia, where, ſays Winthrop, died 1800 people in the year 1635.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1638 was very hot and dry in England, as it was in America, after a very ſevere winter, and cold ſpring.</p>
                  <p>In this year was a moſt tremendous earthquake in Calabria, memorable for the deſtruction of whole towns and the loſs of 30,000 lives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="185" facs="unknown:036687_0189_100AA1FA69F374C8"/>On the firſt of June, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, in a clear warm day, with a weſterly wind, happened a great earthquake in America, which extended from the Piſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aqua to the Connecticut, and perhaps over the whole northern region. The year was alſo diſtinguiſhed for tempeſtuous weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; not for ordinary ſtorms which occur many times every year, but violent hurricanes of vaſt extent. On the third of Auguſt a tempeſt raiſed the tide, on the Narraganſett ſhore, fourteen feet above common ſpring tides. Autumn was very rainy and conſiderable ſnow fell in October, which our anceſtors aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the earthquake. On the 25th of September, another mighty tempeſt occurred and the higheſt ſwell of the ſea that had then been obſerved in America. If I miſtake not, the ſtate of the atmoſphere, during earthquakes and eruptions of volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes, is peculiarly diſpoſed, not only to produce high winds, but to generate ſnow and hail.</p>
                  <p>This year was very ſickly in America. In December a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral faſt was obſerved, one reaſon for which was the prevalence of the "ſmall-pox and fevers."</p>

                  <p>The ſpring of 1639 in America was very dry, there was no rain from April 26th, to June 4th, O. S. and from the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came ſwarms of ſmall flies, which covered the ſea, but they did not invade the land.</p>

                  <p>The plague continued to infeſt London, without interruption, from 1636 to 1648; ſee the bills of mortality; but it was not epidemic, nor very fatal.</p>
                  <p>In 1640 a hard winter, and epidemic pleuriſies were fatal in Europe. The following year, a malignant fever was epidemic, in England, and other countries.</p>
                  <p>In September 11th appeared, in the evening, a remarkable light in the heavens, about 30 or 40 feet in length; it moved rapidly and was viſible about a minute. It was ſeen in Boſton, in Plymouth and in New-Haven, and to the ſpectators every

                  <bibl>Winthrop, p. 232.</bibl>
                  <p>I notice this fact as it confirms the teſtimony of ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who, in deſcribing the ſeaſons and phenomena of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential periods, frequently mention ſimilar appearances. This ſeems to have been of the figure of a beam, called by the Latin writers, <hi>trabs,</hi> but it differed from thoſe meteors diſcribed by ancient writers, in the rapidity of its motion.</p>
                  <p>In November following a ſeries of tempeſts took place, and the higheſt tide ever known at Boſton.</p>
                  <p>This ſummer of 1641 was remarkably wet and cold, ſo that a great part of the corn did not come to maturity. Thoſe who fed on it, the year following, were exceedingly troubled with worms, and ſome perſons found a remedy in leaving bread and living on fiſh.</p>
                  <bibl>Winthrop, p. 234.</bibl>
                  <p>The following winter was the moſt ſevere that had been known for 40 years. The bay at Boſton was frozen ſo that teams and loads paſſed to the town from the neighboring iſlands. The ſnow was deep, and Cheſapeek bay was nearly frozen. At Boſton, the ice extended to ſea, as far as the eye could reach. The following ſpring 1642 was early, but wet.</p>
                  <bibl>Winthrop, p. 240, 243.</bibl>
                  <p>The oldeſt Indians declared they could ſcarcely recollect ſuch a winter.</p>
                  <p>This ſevere winter was followed by a very ſickly ſummer on the Delaware river. Such was the mortality among the ſettlers from New-Haven, who had not long been in that country, that it broke up their ſettlement. The Swedes ſettled there ſuffered much by the ſame diſeaſe.</p>

                  <p>The very wet weather of the laſt year produced a dearth of corn in Boſton, in the ſpring of 1643, and myriads of pigeons appeared alſo and did no ſmall injury, the ſame ſeaſon. It is an old obſervation, in America, that pigeons are uncommonly nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in the ſpring of ſickly years.

                  <p>In England, in 1643 a malignant fever was epidemic and few eſcaped. In autumn, it put on peſtilential ſymptoms and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiae. The ſame year, an eruption of Veſuvius and of Etna.</p>

                  <p>"In 1655 there was another faint cough that paſſed through the whole country of New-England, occaſioned by ſome ſtrange diſtemper or infection of the air. It was ſo epidemical, that few perſons eſcaped. It began about the end of June. Few were able to viſit their friends or perform the laſt teſtimony of reſpect to any of their relations at a diſtance. Of this died Mr. Nathaniel Rogers, miniſter of Ipſwich."</p>

                  <p>It will be obſerved that this epidemic commenced in the heat of ſummer, and that its invaſion was ſudden and univerſal. In November 1655 occurred an earthquake in South-America.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſeaſons in America I have no account; but in Europe the winter of 1654-5 was extremely ſevere. The rivers and harbors in Holland were all made faſt with ice; a ſeries of ſnow ſtorms took place in April, and as late as the 19th there was a ſevere froſt at Bruſſels.</p>

the diſeaſe was raging in Turkey, in Preſburg, Hungary and in the city of Moſcow, it is alledged, periſhed 200,000 inhabitants. We have here preciſe and authentic evidence, that the plague appeared in Cheſter, in the north-weſt of England, in Denmark, in Ruſſia, Hungary and Turkey, in the <hi>ſame ſeaſon.</hi> To prove this to be the effect of a general principle, we have numberleſs authorities, in the Gazettes of that and the next year, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant diſeaſes prevailed over Europe.

                  <p>In 1655 the plague was more general in Europe. It prevailed in Sardinia, Malta, Leyden, Amſterdam, and in Riga, a Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian port at the mouth of the Divina. There died in Riga 9000 —Amſterdam 13,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I have not materials for a complete view of the diſeaſes of this peſtilential period.

                  <p>The ſummer of 1656 was hot, and an earthquake in the ſouth of Italy accompanied the dreadful mortality.</p>

The account recorded is that there "was a great ſickneſs and mortality, throughout New-England in 1658. The ſeaſon was intemperate and the crops light." Trumbull, p. 244. This year was alſo diſtinguiſhed for what is called in our annals, the "Great Earthquake." This is an inſtance of a violent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the earth, in the ſame year with violent rains; but unfortunately I can find no account which phenomenon preceded the other. The ſummer was ſo rainy, that the chriſtianized Indians obſerved days of faſting, on that account, apprehending that their crops would fail and the world be drowned.</p>
                  <bibl>Neal, vol. 1. 259.</bibl>
                  <p>The introduction of the plague into Naples was aſcribed to a tranſport of ſoldiers from Sardinia. How the diſeaſe came to be in Sardinia, we are not informed. But this report, like nine tenths of all the ſtories about infection, is demonſtrably a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. The account given in the hiſtory of the diſeaſe, is, that it was at firſt called by phyſicians a "malignant fever." One of the faculty, a man probably of more obſervation and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than the others, affirmed the diſtemper to be peſtilential, and for his audacity, was impriſoned by the Viceroy, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the report might injure the buſineſs and reputation of the city.</p>
                  <p>We have then another inſtance of the uncertainty in the minds of medical gentlemen, about the nature of the diſeaſe, when it firſt appeared, becauſe it was not characterized by the diſtinctive marks of the plague, the glandular tumors. This circumſtance demonſtrates that the diſeaſe was <hi>not</hi> imported, but an epidemic; appearing firſt, as <hi>al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> great</hi> plagues firſt appear, in the form of catarrh, inflammatory fevers, affections of the throat, and typhus fevers.</p>
                  <p>There cannot be a more clear and demonſtrable truth, than that a diſeaſe of ſpecific contagion, muſt communicate a diſeaſe of the ſame ſpecific character. If the plague has this ſpecies of contagion, it cannot communicate another diſeaſe, a malignant fever, for inſtance, which has a different character or type, and
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:036687_0196_100AA20AF3B847B8"/>
is deſtitute of the diſtinctive marks of the plague. A ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance might occur, in which the diſeaſe might not bear the character of its original; but it is abſurd to ſuppoſe, that a plague <hi>with</hi> glandular tumors, can communicate and render epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic a fever <hi>without</hi> glandular tumors.</p>
                  <p>Yet all ſevere plagues firſt appear in the form of ſuch fever, or other diſeaſes <hi>without tumors.</hi> I challenge the followers of Mead to produce an exception. Hence the uncertainty that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexes the phyſician and the magiſtrate at the commencement of the plague—an uncertainty that has originated in the errors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſpecific nature of the diſeaſe and its propagation by infection—errors as fatal to great cities, as to truth and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
                  <p>Had the real origin of this diſeaſe been known, the certainty of the exiſtence of it in Naples, Venice, Rome, Vienna, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam and London, would have induced the citizens to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the places, before the diſtemper had made much progreſs, and multitudes of lives would have been ſaved—an expedient practiſed in America, with the moſt ſalutary effects.</p>
                  <p>In Genoa, the diſeaſe manifeſted a more diſtinct progreſſion; 10,000 died the firſt year, and about 70,000 the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>When this diſtemper appeared in Malta, Candia and Sardinia, every poſſible precaution was taken to prevent its introduction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Genoa, by ſtopping intercourſe with thoſe places; but in vain.</p>
                  <p>When the report of a malignant infectious fever in Naples prevailed in May 1656, an alarm was excited in Rome; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of health watched over the ſafety of that city; four of the gates were ſhut and barred; the others were guarded with vigilance to prevent any perſon from entering who could be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected of infection; but all efforts were uſeleſs. The real truth was the diſeaſe was an epidemic, no more under the control of health laws, than the influenza and ſore throat which had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded it.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1657 in England was very hot, and ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a long ſevere winter and deep ſnow.</p>
                  <p>In April 1658 commenced in Europe an epidemic catarrh, which was ſo ſudden in its attack as to ſeize a whole village in a

night. It was ſevere and fatal to old people—its courſe was fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in about ſix weeks. The ſummer was hot and fevers with vertigo and delirium, were epidemic.</p>
                  <bibl>See Short, vol. 1. and Morton's Treatiſe.</bibl>
                  <p>It will be remarked that the year 1647 when the influenza invaded America, was a ſickly year in Europe. In 1655 when the plague was epidemic in Europe, the influenza again prevailed in America. In 1658 when the influenza invaded Europe, great ſickneſs and mortality occurred in America. Theſe alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of epidemic diſeaſes will be obſerved in the ſubſequent ſtages of this hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>In 1659 prevailed the Cynanche Trachealis in America—the firſt inſtance mentioned in our annals. Magnalia, b. 4. 156.— This diſeaſe was alſo ſucceeded by malignant diſeaſes, for the Legiſlature of Connecticut in October 1662 appointed a day of thankſgiving, two reaſons aſſigned for which were, the "abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſickneſs in the country, and a ſupply of rain in time of drouth."</p>
                  <p>This was the commencement of a very ſickly period in Europe. In 1660 occurred an eruption of Veſuvius, and of a volcano in Iceland. The year was very tempeſtuous, and earthquakes ſhook England, France and America. In 1661 appeared a comet.</p>
                  <p>In 1662 another conſiderable earthquake happened in New-England; and in this year was the drouth above mentioned.— In 1663 Canada was convulſed for five months by a ſeries of ſucceſſive ſhocks—ſmall rivers and ſprings were dried up—the waters of others were tinctured with the taſte of ſulphur—an immenſe ridge of mountains ſubſided to a plain. Such were the phenomena in America which marked this peſtilential period.</p>

                  <p>In 1663 a malignant diſeaſe ſeized the inhabitants of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian territories and 60,000 periſhed. The country, at the ſame time, was overrun by innumerable ſmall worms.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame year, a memorable mortality occurred in England, among the cattle and ſheep, by means of a diſeaſe in which the
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:036687_0198_100AA210CE4B39B8"/>
liver was eaten by ſmall worms, and in ſome caſes, the lungs. Theſe phenomena were the precurſors of the plague in many parts of Europe. In England, all diſeaſes aſſumed new violence, as early as in 1661, preparatory to the great plague. See Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham. In Holland, the plague appeared at Heuſden, in 1663.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1663-4 was mild. In the following ſummer, Pruſſia was afflicted by a malignant purple fever, attended with tumors or inflammation in the throat, very fatal to the young. Bonnetus. Med. Septen. p. 206. A ſpecies of ſcarlatina.</p>
                  <p>In 1664 appeared a comet; another in 1665, and a third in 1666. In 1664 began an eruption of Etna, which laſted, with various degrees of violence, till the year 1669, when it ended with a moſt dreadful exploſion. This period correſponds with the epidemics deſcribed by Sydenham.</p>
                  <p>In 1664 the ſummer in England was wet, and cattle died of diſeaſes. In New-England commenced the mildew of wheat, which has rendered it impoſſible to cultivate that grain, on the Atlantic coaſt of the three Eaſtern States. The winter of 1664-5, was terribly ſevere in England; the Thames was a bridge of ice, and in January happened earthquakes, in Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Buckinghamſhire. During this winter inflammatory fevers and quinſies, ſays Sydenham, were more frequent in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, than were before known. Theſe gave way in May to a malignant fever, which could hardly be diſtinguiſhed from the plague, which, in June, became the controling epidemic.</p>
                  <p>Such were the phenomena of the peſtilential period under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and at this time, the plague appeared in Holland, and in England. Engliſh authors all agree that the diſeaſe was imported into England from Holland in ſome bales of cotton! O fatal bales of cotton! ſays Short. This tale has been record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and repeated by every writer on the ſubject, without a ſingle document in evidence to prove that any cotton was imported, or that the firſt perſons ſeized had ever ſeen ſuch cotton. The whole tale reſts on aſſertion. That the ſeeds of the diſtemper were <hi>not</hi> imported is evident from the acknowledged facts relative to its origin; and is demonſtrated by the hiſtory of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding diſeaſes found in the works of Sydenham.</p>

                  <p>In the ſubſtance of the foregoing ſtatement, all authors are agreed, and I want no other proof that the report of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the diſeaſe is all a vulgar, childiſh tale, the propagation
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:036687_0200_100AA2736F214AD8"/>
of which is a diſgrace to philoſophy and to the faculty of that age.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place we have no authentic evidence in any author, that any bales of cotton were brought from Holland to London, at that time. The whole aſſertion reſts on vulgar report, and is wholly unſupported by proof—had the report been well founded, the fact might have been aſcertained, and in an affair of ſuch magnitude, probably would have been. The importation of goods from Holland was prohibited by act of parliament.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, the diſeaſe firſt appeared in Weſtminſter, not in the commercial city of London, but in a place where bales of cotton would be the leaſt likely to be depoſited and opened; Weſtminſter being the reſidence of the nobility and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, rather than a place of commerce.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, no proof is ſtated that the perſons firſt ſeized had any connection with bales of cotton.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place, the death of two or three perſons, with the plague-marks on their bodies, in December 1664, is no evidence of any imported infection at that time; for the bills of mortality ſhow, and the reader is deſired to turn to them, to be ſatisfied, that a ſmaller number died that year of the plague, than had died of it in any of the ſix preceding years. In the year 1659 died of that diſeaſe 36—in 1661 died 20, and every year more or leſs. In 1664 died but 6 of the plague, and yet this number, ſmall as it was, muſt be proof of the importation of infection, <hi>that year,</hi> when <hi>greater numbers,</hi> in preceding years, are paſſed over in ſilence! In ſuch accounts, there muſt be want of knowledge, or want of honeſty. The plague imported from Holland! when the city of London had not been free from it, for 28 years preceding! See the bills of mortality!—</p>
                  <p>Beſides, why in the name of common ſenſe, ſhould "two or three," infected perſons in 1664, ſpread the plague over Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and deſolate the city, when twelve, fourteen, twenty and thirty-ſix infected perſons, who died in preceding years, produced no ill effects? To account for ſuch effects on the principle of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> is not poſſible; and men of ſcience ought to be aſhamed of ſuch abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="unknown:036687_0201_100AA275CE167200"/>In the fifth place, the ſuſpenſion of the diſeaſe, during ſix weeks, is evidence, that infection had no agency in ſpreading the diſeaſe. It is a fact known and acknowledged, that <hi>infection</hi> cannot be preſerved, for a tenth part of that time in the open air. Air diſſolves the poiſon of any diſeaſe, in a very ſhort time. Infection can only be preſerved in confinement, as in cloſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels or packages of goods. The walls of an infected houſe will be cleanſed by the action of air, in a very few days, ſo as to be perfectly harmleſs. During the ſix weeks ſuſpenſion of the plague in London, where was the infection concealed to preſerve it from air and froſt?</p>
                  <p>Was the fomes ſhut up by deſign for a few weeks and then ſet at liberty? Had the perſons who were firſt ſeized in Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, any acceſs to the infected houſes or clothes of thoſe who died in December? Is this probable? There is no ſuggeſtion of this ſort.</p>
                  <p>Then again another interval of ſeveral weeks elapſed from the death of thoſe in February, before others were feized. It is not ſolely improbable; but I aver, that the fomes or infecting principle of no diſeaſe whatever, can be ſuſpended in a ſtate of inaction, in the open air, and afterwards give riſe to diſeaſe. Unleſs therefore it can be proved that the perſons who died in April had acceſs to infection, which had been cloſely confined from the air, they could never have received the diſeaſe from the virus generated in February or December. Now it appears from the ſtatement, that the perſons, ſeized in February, lived in a different part of the city, from thoſe who died in December, and no ſuggeſtion that they had an intercourſe with any infected object.</p>
                  <p>But the laſt ſentence of the ſtatement diſproves fully all aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſuſpicions reſpecting infection. It ſeems that when the diſeaſe ſhowed itſelf in ſpring, it ſeized one here, and another there, in ſcattered ſituations, "without any certain proof of their having infected each other." This is uſually the caſe in the plague, and in the yellow fever, in the ulcerous ſore throat, the dyſentery and other contagious, epidemic diſeaſes.

It is preciſely with the acceſs of the plague, in a city, as with a company of men going from a healthy ſituation, into a marſhy place—one man will be ſeized very ſpeedily with the ague and fever; another will ſuſtain his health for a week or two, and ſome perhaps eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape unaffected. This example explains the phenomena which attend the invaſion of peſtilence, as related by Evagrius, Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merbroeck and others, and which will be more fully diſcuſſed in a ſubſequent ſection.</p>
                  <p>The account therefore of the origin of the plague in London in 1665, not only does not prove the diſeaſe to have proceeded from imported fomes, but actually demonſtrates the impoſſibility of the fact.</p>
                  <p>But we have better evidence than the popular accounts afford us, that the diſeaſe was generated in the city of London. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham has left facts on record, which place this point beyond controverſy.</p>
                  <p>After deſcribing the multiplied diſeaſes of increaſed malignity, which prevailed in London, from 1661 to 1665, and which ſwelled greatly the bills of mortality in that city, he informs us that in May 1665 he was called to aſſiſt a woman of a ſanguine habit, who was ſeized with violent fever and frequent vomitings. He was ſurpriſed at the ſingularity of the ſymptoms, and puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled to know how to treat the diſeaſe. The woman died the 14th day. He obſerved her face, during the fever, to be red, and that a little before her death, a few drops of blood iſſued from her noſe. Theſe and other circumſtances ſuggeſted to him the uſe of bleeding, and his next patient recovered.</p>
                  <p>This ſpecies of malignant fever ſoon ſpread and towards the cloſe of May and beginning of June, became epidemic. Soon after appeared the true plague with its characteriſtic ſymptoms. After ſtating theſe facts, Sydenham ſays, "Whether the fever under conſideration deſerves to be entitled a plague, I dare not poſitively affirm; but this I know by experience, that all who
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:036687_0203_100AA27A7599A248"/>
were then ſeized with the true plague, attended with all its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar concomitants, and for ſome time afterwards, in my neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood, had the ſame train of ſymptoms, both in the beginning and through the courſe of the diſeaſe."</p>
                  <p>He then obſerves that he attended ſome perſons with the true plague, and afterwards, he ſaw ſeveral caſes of a ſimilar fever.</p>
                  <bibl>See chap. 2. ſect. 2.</bibl>
                  <p>Had not the faculty been blinded to truth by their theory of <hi>ſpecific contagion,</hi> it would not have been poſſible ſo long to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the <hi>progreſſiveneſs</hi> of the plague, which not only Sydenham, but many phyſicians of the 16th and 17th centuries obſerved and recorded.</p>
                  <p>The malignant diſeaſes which prevailed from 1661 to 1664 marked a <hi>peſtilential ſtate of air</hi> in London. We now know what Sydenham could not know, that this unhealthy ſtate of air extended not only over Europe, but over Perſia and America. But the malignant fever which appeared in May, as deſcribed by Sydenham, was the <hi>firſt ſtage of the plague,</hi> or mild form of the diſeaſe, which <hi>always</hi> precedes that ſtate of it which is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acterized by buboes. This form of the diſeaſe appears before the ſeaſon or ſtate of the atmoſphere is advanced ſufficiently to give the deſtructive principle its full force.</p>
                  <p>The ſame ſpecies of fever preceded the terrible plague in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice and in Naples, as before related; and this is always the cauſe of uncertainty and controverſy reſpecting the nature of the diſeaſe, at its commencement. And it is remarkable that this milder form of the plague, often rages for many months, before the diſeaſe arrives to its criſis. Thus in London, the peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial principle produced a few caſes of real plague, in the winter of 1664-5. The caſes muſt have occurred in conſtitutions more irritable, or ſuſceptible of the cauſe, than bodies in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; or the perſons muſt have been expoſed to the action of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful local cauſes, or to extreme debility. The ſevere froſt doubtleſs ſuſpended the operation of the peſtilential principle— but on the opening of ſpring, the operation began, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the malignant epidemic of May to produce the moſt deadly effects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="unknown:036687_0204_100AA27D4CA555D0"/>I have one obſervation further to make on this ſubejct. It has been alledged and generally admitted that the plague was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into Amſterdam, in 1663 by a veſſel from the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean. It is probable that if this queſtion could be fully can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſed, the popular belief would appear to have had no better foundation, than many opinions in America, in regard to the importation of the yellow fever, which are proved to reſt merely on conjectures, ſuppoſitions, and vague reports. But in regard to the origin of the peſtilence in Holland, in this inſtance, it is wholly immaterial, whether popular opinion was well founded or not; for we have the expreſs authority of Diemerbroeck, that anterior to the arrival of the ſhip, with the ſuppoſed infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the plague broke out in Heuſden, a town on a branch of the Meuſe, ſurrounded by a moraſs, not a maritime place. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſpotted fever, which precedes the plague and turns into it, had been prevailing in all parts of Holland in the preceding year. The peſtilence therefore originated in Holland, <hi>before the infection arrived;</hi> and the tales of importation vaniſh in ſmoke.</p>
                  <p>According to the bills of mortality, London loſt upwards of 68,000 inhabitants by the plague in 1665, and more than 28,000 by other diſeaſes. As the 28,000 deaths by common diſeaſes muſt have occurred moſtly in the ſix firſt months of the year, before the plague raged, this circumſtance ſhows what a great increaſe of mortality preceded the plague. With ſuch evidence before their eyes, how can diſcerning men look abroad for the ſources of the malady!</p>
                  <p>It ſhould alſo be remarked that this calamity among the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race was preceded by a great mortality among cattle in 1664.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not paſs unobſerved that the ſummer of 1665 in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was very temperate, the weather fine and the fruits good. All the writers of that day agree, that no cauſe of peſtilence could be obſerved in the viſible qualities of the ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>This was the laſt plague that has appeared in London, or in Great Britain. The diſappearance of the plague in that and other countries, is a moſt conſoling fact, and one that has not a little engaged the minds of philoſophic men, to diſcover the
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:036687_0205_100AA28006B23FA8"/>
cauſe. The cauſes uſually aſſigned are, the deſtruction of the city by fire in 1666, the more airy, convenient conſtruction of the modern city, the introduction of freſh water, with more cleanlineſs, and improved habits of living.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons would have more weight in my mind, if the other large cities in England, in France, Spain, Holland and Germany, which have neither been burnt nor improved in their general ſtructure, had not alſo eſcaped the ravages of peſtilence. But as the plague has not viſited Paris and Amſterdam, which retain their ancient conſtruction, no more than London, which has been improved, we muſt reſort to other circumſtances for the cauſes of this exemption. The conſideration of this ſubject will fall under another part of this work.</p>
                  <p>In 1666, appeared a comet, the ſummer was very hot, and a tremendous hurricane, tore up a thouſand trees in Nottingham foreſt, and of 50 houſes in one village, ſeven only were left ſtanding. In this tempeſt fell hail-ſtones, as large as hens eggs. An earthquake occurred in Oxfordſhire. Perſia did not eſcape the effects of this peſtilential conſtitution. In 1667 prevailed famin and epidemic diſeaſes, and an earthquake demoliſhed great part of Teflis, the capital of Georgia, and four villages, with the loſs of 30,000 lives; and another city with the loſs of 2,000 lives.</p>

                  <p>In 1666 dyſentery prevailed over England and many parts of Europe and in St. Domingo. This diſeaſe ſeems to be the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of the plague, and other epidemics. During the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory ſtage of an epidemic conſtitution, evidenced by meaſles, influenza, a mild ſmall-pox, we rarely hear of deſtructive dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. But after thoſe diſeaſes have run their courſe, dyſentery appears in many parts of a country, and ſometimes becomes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſal. It would be a curious queſtion, by what means the inflammatory diatheſis, ſo to ſpeak, of the epidemic period, acts upon the nerves, muſcles and inteſtines, to give to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent autumnal fevers this particular direction.</p>
                  <p>During the foregoing ſeries of epidemics in Europe, America did not eſcape. Slight ſhocks of earthquake were felt in 1660,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:036687_0206_100AA28343575CA8"/>
and in 1665. Great ſickneſs prevailed at this period alſo, but I am not informed of the ſpecies of diſorder, except the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox in Boſton in 1666.</p>
                  <p>In 1668, appeared a comet with a ſtupendous coma. This was attended by an exceſſively hot ſummer, and malignant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in America. In New-York the epidemic was ſo fatal, that a faſt was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this ſame year was an earthquake in America, and a meteor in the weſt, in form of a ſpear, pointing towards the ſitting ſun, which greadually ſunk and diſappeared.</p>

                  <p>This year was marked alſo by violent earthquakes in Europe and Aſia. The winter of 1668-9 was very ſevere, and ice was ſeen in the Boſphorus; that of 1670 covered the Danube with a bridge of ice.</p>
                  <p>In winter appeared in Hungary two mock-ſuns of reſplendent brightneſs—the infallible forerunner of great diſcharges of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical fire, or of violent tempeſts.—On the 11th of March 1669, the eruption of Etna which had commenced in 1664 redoubled its fury, and by immenſe diſcharges of lava laid waſte the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try below.

                  <p>In this year, the cats in Weſtphalia died with an eruption on the head, accompanied with drowſineſs. In England prevailed a dangerous fever, with ſlimy tongue and ſore mouth.</p>

                  <p>In 1675 a wet and cool ſummer, the influenza prevailed in Europe with the uſual ſymptoms. In Italy was ſeen a meteor or fire ball, from the north-eaſt; and the following winter in America was colder than uſual.</p>

                  <p>The ſummer of 1678 was very hot and dry. There was a comet and an earthquake in Lima. Fevers and affections of the throat were epidemic in the north of Europe.

                  <p>Notwithſtanding the barrenneſs of my materials, this peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial period may be very clearly diſtinguiſhed, by the meaſles from 1669 to 1672 with the ſmall-pox, the catarrh of 1675, the ſubſequent malignant fevers and affections of the throat, and finally the peſtilence of 1678.</p>
                  <p>The ſame deleterious principle extended to America. Our annals relate that the ſeaſons were unfavorable and the fruits blaſted, while malignant diſeaſes prevailed among the people. The ſickneſs and bad ſeaſons were attributed, by our pious an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, to the irreligion of the times, and to their diſuſe of faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On this occaſion, a ſynod was convened to inveſtigate the cauſes of God's judgments, and to propoſe a plan of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>The comet of 1678 was followed by a very cold winter, after a rainy autumn, with an epidemic cough. A comet is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1679, and the plague was in Vienna.</p>
                  <p>The year 1680 was diſtinguiſhed alſo for a ſevere winter, and the noted comet that had appeared in Juſtinian's reign. In Dreſden raged the plague. The ſummer was hot and ſickly.
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:036687_0208_100AA2882B035E28"/>
A large meteor was ſeen in Germany, deſcending to the north and leaving behind it a long luminous ſtream.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1681 was exceſſively dry. This was the forerunner of violent earthquakes, which, in 1682 ſhook all Germany, Italy and Switzerland. In ſome places, the ſhocks were preceeded, for four nights, by lights or flame, like ignes fatui, on the mountains. The convulſions were attended with a diſagreeable ſulphurous ſmell. In this year alſo was viſible a comet, and an eruption took place, both of Etna and Veſuvius.</p>
                  <p>In this year 1682 a mortal diſeaſe ſpread among the cattle in Italy, Switzerland and Germany, that was called the angina ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligna, and of which cattle died in 24 hours. Authors relate that a blue miſt appeared on the herbage of paſtures. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe moved about two German miles in 24 hours, and ſpread over Germany and Poland. Cattle at rack and manger were affected equally with thoſe that grazed.</p>
                  <p>At Halle in Saxony prevailed the plague; and at Dublin, a petechial in which the brain was ſeverely affected, and bleeding pernicious.</p>
                  <p>The diſcharges of fire already mentioned were productive, as uſual, of violent winds. In Sicily, a tempeſt, preceded by great darkneſs, almoſt laid waſte the iſland.</p>
                  <p>In 1683 was an earthquake in England, in September, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by meteors or lights and fetid exhalations. A comet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in this year, and another in the following.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1683-4 was the coldeſt that could be recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the oldeſt men living. Trees of large ſize ſplit with the froſt.

                  <p>After the ſevere froſt in 1684, a malignant dyſentery raged over Europe. This and the two ſucceeding ſummers were hot and dry. In 1685 Languedoc in France was overrun by graſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers, and the petechial fever was prevalent.</p>
                  <p>In September 1686 was ſeen a comet. At Lille in France, fell a ſtorm of hail, the ſtones of which were of a pound weight. There was an eruption of Etna, in this year alſo, and a meteor was ſeen at Leipſick on the 9th of July, which was ſtationary for 7 minutes, at the height of 30 miles. It is curious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark the coincidence in time between the phenomena of the electrical fluid, tempeſts, ſnow and hail.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1687 in Europe was very rainy. In Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the city of Lima in Peru, was demoliſhed by an earthquake.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1688 was cold, and in the ſummer following epidemic catarrh ſpread over Europe.

                  <p>In 1690 the ſummer was rainy, frogs were in unuſual numbers in Italy, and corn was cut ſhort by mildew. Rainy ſeaſons gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally ſucceed great eruptions of volcanoes and earthquakes.</p>
                  <p>The year 1691 commenced with ſevere froſt, followed by a hot dry ſummer. The ſpotted fever prevailed in Italy, in which bleeding was fatal. There was alſo great mortality among cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and ſheep.</p>
                  <p>The ſeaſons in this year were peculiarly unfavorable in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, altho I am not able to deſcribe them. It appears from the journals of the aſſembly of New-York, that upon an addreſs of

This is a remarkable fact, and not unfrequent, that at one and the ſame time, the powers of veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation fail in the moſt diſtant parts of the earth. Perhaps we ſhall be able to account for this inſtance of a deranged ſtate of the elements by the univerſal exploſions of fire in the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing years. St. Domingo experienced a ſevere earthquake in 1691, in the year of this blaſt on the corn.</p>

                  <p>On the 7th of June 1692 after a ſeries of dry, hot, calm weather, a moſt dreadful earthquake ſuddenly ſunk the town of Port-Royal in Jamaica, and demoliſhed moſt of the buildings on the iſland, with the loſs of 2000 lives. After the earthquake, the heat was ſtill more intenſe, muſquetoes were innumerable, and a malignant fever fell upon the inhabitants in all parts of the iſland, with which 3000 periſhed.</p>

                  <p>It is not within my limits to enumerate the miſeries occaſioned by this concuſſion of the earth. Suffice it ſay that many towns were laid in ruins and 60,000 people periſhed. During the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion a fountain diſcharged its waters as red as blood. This calamity was preceded by a ſerene ſky, and followed by dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or vapor of a reddiſh or yellow hue.</p>
                  <p>The effects of this earthquake were remarkable on the human body. Among theſe were malignant fevers, ſmall-pox fatal among children; madneſs, dullneſs, ſottiſhneſs and melancholy, with deliria and lethargy. Are not theſe effects produced by an exceſs of ſtimulus, occaſioned by the ſuperabundance of electricity?</p>
                  <p>The ſummer following this convulſion of the earth, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperately wet and cool, and corn was mildewed.

                     </gap> Wounds degenerated into ulcers, and bliſters were followed by mortification which proved fatal to many.</p>
                  <p>In this year alſo Etna in Sicily, and Heckla in Iceland diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged fire and lava; a new volcano was opened in Aſia, and an iſland, called Sorea, near the Moluccas, was ruined by its volcano.</p>
                  <p>Moſt dreadful ſtorms marked the ſame year; one in America, on the 19th of October, was memorable for its violence.</p>
                  <p>An epidemic catarrh began in Europe in October, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by a ſimilar diſeaſe among horſes.</p>
                  <p>The preceding winter was probably very mild in America; for on the 13th of February, Gov. Fletcher, with a body of troops, ſailed from New-York for Albany.</p>

                  <p>In 1693 the ſeamen and ſoldiers, under Sir Francis Wheeler, who was ſent to conquer Martinico, were ſeized with the plague of America, and three fourths of them periſhed. Hutchinſon, vol. 2. 72, relates that this fleet came to Boſton and introduced the diſeaſe into that town, where it occaſioned a deplorable mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Douglas relates the ſame fact.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="208" facs="unknown:036687_0212_100AA29160408FB0"/>This account ſeems to be contradicted by Mather, in his Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia, b. 1. 22. In a ſermon delivered on lecture day, April 7, 1698, it is aſſerted in ſo many words, that "An Engliſh ſquadron hath <hi>not</hi> brought among us the tremendous peſtilence, under which a <hi>neighboring plantation</hi> hath undergone prodigious deſolations. Boſton, 'tis a marvellous thing a plague has <hi>not</hi> laid thee deſolate."</p>
                  <p>By comparing the date of this ſermon, with other events re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in it, I find there is no miſtake in the date; and as the author lived in Boſton, and was cotemporary with theſe events, and perſonally acquainted with Sir Francis Wheeler, I conclude it was not Boſton, but ſome other ſea port town, which ſuffered by the arrival of a fleet.</p>
                  <p>In the 2d book of Magnalia, p. 71, the ſame author men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this expedition and the terrible mortality. He ſays the diſtemper was "the moſt like the plague, of any thing that had ever been ſeen in America, whereof there died <hi>before the fleet could reach to Boſton,</hi> as I was told by Sir Francis himſelf, 1300 ſailors out of 2100, and 1800 ſoldiers out of 2400."</p>
                  <p>In book 7. 116, the ſame author ſays, "there was an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh fleet of our good friends with a direful plague aboard <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending hither.</hi> Had they come, as they intended, what an horrible deſolation had cut us off, let the deſolate places, <hi>that ſome of you have ſeen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From this authentic hiſtory, written by a cotemporary clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, we infer that Hutchinſon muſt have made a miſtake. Sir Francis Wheeler's fleet arrived at Boſton, moſt dreadfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, but no diſeaſe was propagated in Boſton. Some other fleet, it ſeems, had introduced the diſeaſe into a "colony of the ſouth," perhaps Newport or New-York, but I have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>The great diſcharges of fire and earthquakes of 1693, were followed, as uſual, by an intenſely cold winter. The ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſummer of 1694 was not and exceſſively dry in Italy, till October, when the earth was deluged with rain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="unknown:036687_0213_100AA292FA6B1018"/>In May was a violent earthquake and volcano in Banda, an iſland in the Indian ſeas. Fire iſſued from the neighboring ſeas, the air was impregnated with the ſmell of ſulphur, and ſickneſs prevailed. An eruption of Veſuvius happened the ſame year, and violent earthquakes in Sicily and Calabria. In this year the agitations of fire ſeem to have ſubſided; and as uſual, a ſeries of rainy cool ſummers ſucceeded, in which corn periſhed or was blaſted, crops failed, and univerſal dearth enſued.</p>
                  <p>One of the moſt remarkable effects of the late agitations of the elements, was the frequency of apoplexies in Italy. So common were they in 1695, as to be called epidemic, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion general conſternation. This is not an infrequent conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the high excitement that takes place in peſtilential times, ending in extreme debility in the brain. Something of this kind has been obſerved in America, within the laſt few years.</p>
                  <p>I have very few facts in regard to the ſeaſons and diſeaſes in America, during this period, from 1689 to 1695. It appears however that the diſorders of the elements were experienced in America.</p>
                  <p>In 1695 prevailed a mortal ſickneſs among the Indians in the eaſtern parts of this continent.</p>

                  <p>A contagious fever prevailed in Bermuda, the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>In Europe many malignant fevers prevailed, but no epidemics, except meaſles and chin cough of a bad type. In Ireland ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared offenſive fogs, a thick clammy dew on the herbage, of a yellow color, and conſiſtence of butter. A ſimilar ſubſtance was obſerved at Middletown, Connecticut, on the morning after the earthquake, May 17, 1791.</p>
                  <p>The year 1696 was cool and wet—ſummer in Britain, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled winter, and winter was like ſummer. Corn was mildewed. Dyſentery fatal among children.</p>
                  <p>In America the winter of 1696-7, according to Hutchinſon, was very ſevere. Loaded ſleds paſſed from Boſton to Nantaſket. Food was ſcarce and loſſes at ſea very great. I am not without ſuſpicions however, that the author has here deſcribed the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing winter, which was as ſevere as he has repreſented it.</p>

                  <p>In a diary kept by Daniel Fairfield, of Braintree, in Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, an unlettered man of good underſtanding, I have a particular deſcription of an influenza that prevailed in America in the ſevere winter of 1697-8.<note n="*" place="bottom">For this and many other articles of intelligence, I am indebted to the late Dr. Jeremy Belknap, whoſe value as a man and as a hiſtorian many years friendſhip and correſpondence had taught me to appreciate, and whoſe loſs to ſociety and the republic of letters, I moſt deeply la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> This catarrh began in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember and prevailed till February. Its violence was in Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, when whole families were ſick at once, and whole towns were ſeized nearly at the ſame time. It appears to have been an epidemic of the ſevere kind; and the epidemics which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it in America were of correſpondent ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame winter a mortal diſeaſe raged in the town of Fairfield in Connecticut, which was ſo general, that well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons could ſcarcely be found to tend the ſick and bury the dead. Seventy perſons were buried in three months, altho it may be doubted whether the town then contained 1000 inhabitants.</p>

                  <p>On the 20th of June 1698 the town of Latacunga, in the province of Quito, nearly under the equator, was laid in ruins by an earthquake, as were Riobamba, Hambato and other towns in the ſame diſtrict. In one place a chaſm of five feet broad and a league in length, was opened, and on a mountain happened a volcanic eruption, from which iſſued aſhes, cinders and flames.</p>

                     <pb n="211" facs="unknown:036687_0215_100AA298ADA62840"/>The malignant fever already mentioned, whatever might have been its preciſe ſymptoms, was ſoon followed by more general ſickneſs. In 1699 raged in Charleſton South-Carolina and in Philadelphia, the moſt deadly bilious plague that probably ever affected the people of this country.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Norris of Philadelphia has kindly favored me with a ſight of a number of M. S. letters of his grand-father Iſaac Norris, written during the ſickneſs, to his correſpondents. This worthy gentleman was then in trade, and well acquainted with the facts reſpecting the diſeaſe, as his own family ſuffered a loſs of ſeveral of its members.</p>
                  <p>In a letter dated Auguſt 15, 1699, he mentions, that a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever broke out about the beginning of Auguſt, which he deſcribes as the "Barbadoes diſtemper," tho he gives no intimations of its being communicated from countries abroad by infection. He ſays the patients "vomited and voided blood."</p>
                  <p>On the 24th of Auguſt, arrived the Britannia from Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool, which had been 13 weeks on her paſſage; ſhe had 200 paſſengers on board—had loſt fifty by death, and others were ſickly.</p>
                  <p>September 1ſt, he writes that the diſtemper appeared to abate at one time, but afterwards revived. He mentions the ſummer to be the hotteſt he ever knew; men died at harveſt in the field. All buſineſs in the city was ſuſpended.</p>
                  <p>During the yearly meeting the diſeaſe abated, but the meeting was thinly attended. Afterwards the diſeaſe returned in all its violence.</p>
                  <p>October 9th, he writes that he had hoped the cool weather would have relieved the city, but it did not.</p>
                  <p>October 22d, the diſeaſe had abated. Of this epidemic, died two hundred and twenty, of whom eighty or ninety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the ſociety of friends.</p>
                  <p>The population of Philadelphia at this time, is not exactly aſcertained; but as the city had been ſettled but ſeventeen years, the number of people could not have been great. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the city was thinly inhabited, and that no conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble artificial cauſes of diſeaſe had been accumulated; together
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:036687_0216_100AA29A7AED28C8"/>
with the fact of the patient's vomiting and voiding blood, we muſt admit the diſeaſe to have been extremely virulent, beyond any thing that has marked its returns in ſubſequent periods.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame letters, Mr. Norris, October 18th, mentions that he had information from Charleſton of the great mortality by the ſame fever—150 had died in a few days, and the ſurvivors moſtly fled into the country.</p>
                  <p>In a hiſtory of South-Carolina, lately publiſhed, there is a more particular account of the calamities that befel Charleſton in this year 1699. A moſt dreadful tempeſt, a common event after exceſſive heat, threatened a total deſtruction of the town. The ſea ſwelled and ruſhed violently into the town, compelling the people to fly to the tops of their houſes for ſafety. A fire broke out and laid moſt of the town in aſhes. The ſmall-pox proved fatal to many of the youth, and to fill the cup of calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, the bilious plague broke out with ſuch irreſiſtible mortality, that the principal officers of government, one half of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of aſſembly and multitudes of the citizens fell victims. Theſe calamities came near to diſſolve the ſettlement.</p>
                  <bibl>Hiſt. of S. Carolina, vol. 1. 142.</bibl>
                  <p>I find no ſuggeſtion that any veſſels had arrived from the Weſt-Indies at theſe places, or that any ſuſpicion exiſted of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of this terrible diſeaſe. At that time, there was very little intercourſe directly between Philadelphia or Charleſton and the Weſt-Indies.</p>
                  <p>But it will be remarked, that the diſeaſe firſt appeared about the "beginning of Auguſt," as in modern times—that it once abated, as it did in New-York, both in 1795 and 6, ſo as to be extinguiſhed in the latter year, and that for two or three weeks.—That in 1699 as in later returns of it, it yielded not to cool weather, until late in October. It will be further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that a ſevere epidemic catarrh preceded this plague, about eighteen months, as it did in 1789-90.</p>
                  <p>During this period, other parts of the earth did not eſcape affliction. A comet appeared in 1698 and another ſmall one in 1699; and in this latter year, Lima ſuffered conſiderable damage by an earthquake, as did ſome parts of Batavia in the Eaſt-Indies.</p>

                  <p>The ſeven laſt years of this century, the period under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, were diſtinguiſhed for a ſevere and continued famin in Scotland. The general cauſe was, the wet and cold ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers which prevented crops from arriving to maturity. Vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes periſhed with hunger—the dead bodies lay ſcattered along the highways. See Sinclair's Statiſtical account of Scotland in a great number of paſſages, and eſpecially vol. 6. 132, 189. It does not appear that, during this long period of diſtreſs and want, any peſtilence prevailed in Scotland.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, famin afflicted Finland and carried off one tenth of the inhabitants, and a greater proportion in the leſs fertile provinces of Sweden.</p>

                  <p>The ſame period was remarkable for failure of crops in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. In a ſermon preached in Boſton on Lecture Day, Sept. 27, 1698, we have the following account of this ſubject. "The harveſt hath once and again grievouſly failed, in theſe years, and we have been ſtruck through with terrible famin.— The very courſe of nature hath been altered among us; a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable cry for <hi>bread, bread,</hi> hath been heard in our ſtreets."</p>

                  <p>In the preceding page, of this ſermon, it is alſo remarked, that "Epidemical ſickneſſes have, in theſe years, been once and again upon us," and it is mentioned that Boſton loſt, in one year, ſix or ſeven hundred of its people, by one contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.

<pb n="214" facs="unknown:036687_0218_100AA2A10CE24F30"/>
the ſtrength of facts within the preſent century, that whenever malignant epidemics prevail generally in Europe or America, the plague ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es in Egypt and Conſtantinople, or rather a little before; the commencement of the peſtilential ſtate of air in thoſe unhealthy cities being a little anterior to its principal ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the north of Europe.</p>
                  <p>At the time of the dreadful bilious plague in Philadelphia and Charleſton juſt before deſcribed, the plague was raging in the Levant, and for a year or two after.</p>
                  <p>During this period, in 1700, the ſame peſtilential conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſplayed itſelf in a moſt deſtructive ſore throat in the iſland of Milo, in the Levant. It is thus deſcribed by Tournefort, vol. 1. let. 4. He ſays it appeared in a "Carbuncle or plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore in the bottom of the throat, attended with a violent fever." It carried off children in two days, but ſpared adults. He calls it the "child's plague." There appears to be ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in giving the diſeaſe this appellation. It has ſome reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the true peſtis, the ulcer being formed in the throat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the glands. The inſidiouſneſs of the diſtemper is another circumſtance of reſemblance—perſons in both diſeaſes often walking about, a few hours before they expire. But this is a moſt prominent fact, that the ulcerous ſore throat, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant anginas are rarely or never epidemic, except in periods when the plague and yellow fever prevail in places where they uſually appear. In no inſtance has the ſore throat been epidemic in America, except when the plague has been raging in Egypt and Conſtantinople. At leaſt I can find no exception to this remark; and what is more, the virulence of the one diſeaſe in one country, correſponds with the malignity of the other diſeaſe in the other countries. Thus, as the plague in Egypt in 1736, was far more deſtructive than the ſame diſeaſe, at other times, ſo was the angina maligna of that period in America.</p>
                  <p>When obſervation and philoſophy ſhall prevail over the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of men in regard to the origin of theſe diſeaſes from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it will be found that the angina, in its various forms, is only a particular ſtage or modification of the peſtilence, which ſpreads over the world at certain unequal periods. The milder
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:036687_0219_100AA2A295973CA8"/>
forms of the peſtilence appear in catarrh, meaſles and chin cough; which uſually appear together, or nearly ſo, at the beginning of the more virulent general contagion; the later and more fatal ſtages are marked by anginas, cynanche maligna, petechial fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, bilious and glandular plague in ſummer; and peſtilential pleuriſies in winter.</p>
                  <p>There are certain times, when the conſtitutions of men in all parts of the world, contract a poiſon, which nature makes an effort to expel; and the different epidemics that accompany or follow each other, in rapid ſucceſſion, appear to be the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent modes by which nature ſtrives to rid the human body of the virus. Theſe modes depend on the ſeaſon of the year, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution or age of the patient and a multitude of ſubordinate circumſtances.—Whether this poiſon is a poſitive ſubſtance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled by the lungs and pores, or is the effect of mere debility, which unfits the ſeveral parts of the body to perform their func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is a queſtion of a curious nature.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable that in this year 1700, when this ulcerous ſore throat was raging in the Levant Iſles, ſmall children in the north of Europe were ſeized with a ſuffocating catarrh or catarrh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fevers. Theſe were followed by mild epidemic meaſles.</p>

                  <head>SECTION VII. Hiſtorical view of peſtilential epidemics from the year <hi>1701</hi> to <hi>1788.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE year 1701 appears to have been exceſſively dry in America. Dr. Ruſh relates that during the dry ſummer of 1782, a rock in the Skuylkill appeared above the ſurface of the water, on which were engraven the figures 1701. How little do men ſuſpect the value of this inſcription! To this alone I am indebted for the fact of extreme drouth in that year—and the fact is among the proofs of an extraordinary evaporation, before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges of fire and lava from volcanoes. In 1701 was an erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Veſuvius; in 1702 of Etna. It will hereafter appear that a ſimilar dry ſeaſon in 1782 preceded the great eruption of Heckla in 1783. Indeed it is a general fact, and as far as I can learn, ſuch ſeaſons ſeldom occur, except during the approach of comets, or antecedent to volcanic eruptions.</p>
                  <p>This was a peſtilential period. In 1701 Toulon loſt two thirds of its inhabitants by the plague, and the Levant was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely affected about the ſame time. See the bills of mortality for Augſburg, Dreſden and Boſton.</p>
                  <p>In 1702 appeared a comet; Etna diſcharged its fires, and in Boſton raged a malignant ſmall-pox, attended, in many caſes, with a ſcarlet eruption, which was miſtaken for the ſcarlet fever. It appears from Fairfield's diary that this diſeaſe appeared in June and was at firſt mild, not fatal to any of the patients. In Auguſt died one patient—in September it became very mortal, and in this month was attended with a "ſort of fever called ſcarlet fever." In October, many died of the "fever and the ſmall-pox, and it was a time of ſore diſtreſs," on which account the general court ſat at Cambridge. In December "the fever
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:036687_0221_100AA2A6A8E87538"/>
abated;" but the ſmall-pox continued to be mortal, till the month of February 1703, when it began to ſubſide.</p>
                  <p>I have already remarked that eruptive diſeaſes ſeem to belong to one family. Phyſicians will obſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he alliance in their ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms; but I would obſerve that the progreſſiveneſs in this diſeaſe of 1702 and the variations in its ſymptoms, prove it to have been an epidemic, and not the effect of mere infection, or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific contagion.</p>
                  <p>In this year alſo the drouth was extreme. In New-York ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the American plague, which was ſaid to have been imported from St. Thomas's. By the accounts, this was more fatal than any diſeaſe ſince that period. It was called the "Great Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs" and hardly a patient ſurvived. On account of it, the aſſembly was held at Jamaica on Long-Iſland.</p>
                  <bibl>Smith's Hiſt. N. York, p. 104. Journals of Aſſembly, vol. 1. 151.</bibl>
                  <p>Such were the epidemics in America which followed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenza of 1698—malignant pleuriſies in 1698—plague in 1699 and in 1702, with virulent ſmall-pox—all of unuſual ſeverity. Let the reader compare theſe facts with the accounts from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope and the bills of mortality.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1702-3 was variable—ſevere froſt and great ſnows, with intervals of warm weather. In ſpring catarrh prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in England, followed by a ſickly ſummer, with earthquakes.</p>
                  <p>In January and February 1703 were ſevere ſhocks of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake in Rome, Naples and other parts of Italy. In October a memorable tempeſt or hurricane, which did great damage at ſea, and injured buildings on land.</p>
                  <p>In 1704 the ſummer was very dry, and a moſt malignant ſpotted fever raged in Augſburg and in Pruſſia. Flies were in great abundance, and there was an eruption of Veſuvius. The laſt eruption of the volcano in Teneriffe was in this year, ſince which it has diſcharged ſmoke, but no fire.</p>
                  <p>Note. A late arrival from Teneriffe brings an account of the burſting forth of a volcano, in June laſt, which continued, till the veſſel left the iſland in Auguſt.</p>
                  <p>In December 1705 were many moſt violent tempeſts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations. The tide roſe in the Loir in France 25 feet beyond
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:036687_0222_100AA2A910457B48"/>
its uſual height. Half of Limerick in Ireland was laid under water. Theſe ſtorms indicated the approach of a comet, which appeared in the following year.</p>
                  <p>In 1706 coughs and coryzas prevailed, and dyſentery fatal among children.</p>
                  <p>A ſmall ſhock of earthquake was felt in America in 1705.</p>
                  <p>In 1707 appeared another comet and ſubterranean fire was uncommonly agitated. Veſuvius diſcharged fire, and a new iſland was thrown up in the Archipelago, with an earthquake and volcano. The ſeaſons in this and the following year were variable.</p>
                  <bibl>Buffon's Nat. Hiſt.</bibl>
                  <p>In November 1708 began a moſt ſevere and univerſal catarrh in Europe, which was ſpeedily followed by a ſeries of peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſeaſes. Of this catarrh, of the ſeaſons, and the plagues that followed we have from Europe very correct accounts; but, with the utmoſt induſtry, I cannot learn whether the catarrh extended to America.</p>
                  <p>The exploſion of ſubterranean fire in various places in 1707 ſeems to have been the commencement of this period; altho there was a plague in the eaſtern parts of Europe, moſt of the preceding years from 1700. A meteor paſſed over England, near the mouth of the Thames, July 31, 1708, a few months before the catarrh.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1708-9 was the ſevereſt that had happened, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 1683-4. But it appears that the catarrh commenced two months before the ſevere cold began. At leaſt this epidemic appeared in the north of Europe, as early as November; whereas the autumn was one of the mildeſt, till January, that was ever known. Then the weather changed ſudde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This catarrh is carefully deſcribed by Lanci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ius as it appeared in Italy. In Rome it commenced in January, but increaſed afterwards, as the cold abated. It began with coryza, rheumata and ſlight cough, and was attended with pains in the breaſt, angina, pleuriſies and peripneumonies, which prevailed greatly in the ſpring, among thoſe who neglected the cough, or uſed a full diet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="219" facs="unknown:036687_0223_100AA2AC1CEA2150"/>Symptoms of this catarrh were, laſſitude, fever with chills, wandering pains in the breaſt, continued cough, hard pulſe, flame-colored or turbid urine, ſpitting of blood and difficult reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration. The cheeks were red and the body ſuffured with a yellow color, like that of the jaundice.</p>
                  <p>Perſons ſhut up in priſon, eſcaped the diſeaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">This has been obſerved in one or two inſtances in America, and has been alledged as an evidence that the influenza is an infectious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and that perſons ſequeſtered from contagion, may eſcape it. To my mind the fact is rather an evidence that the eſcape of priſoners is owing to a different, perhaps a leſs ſtimulant condition of the air they breathe. It is hardly poſſible they ſhould eſcape expoſure to infection, when every one around them is affected. The contagion of the diſeaſe however is not denied.</note> Fewer wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than men were afflicted, and perſons in eaſy circumſtances, who could take care of themſelves, ſuffered leſs than the poor. Many recovered by means of ſweats or hemorrhagy at the noſe, or diſcharges from the bowels, or copious diſcharges of urine, or by all theſe evacuations, accompanied by ſpitting a thick phlegm. Veneſection was beneficial, eſpecially in robuſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. On diſſection, the precordia appeared of a reddiſh color, extending to the diaphragm—and diſcolored by ſpots of blackiſh thick blood—polypuſſes were diſcovered in the great veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the heart.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe did not entirely diſappear till June.</p>
                  <p>In the ſummer of 1708 preceding the ſevere winter and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh, gnats appeared in prodigious ſwarms.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1708-9 killed fruit-trees, vines and corn. After this exceſſive cold, multitudes of people died of apoplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, and others were ſeized with vertigoes, arthritics, pleuriſies, inflammatory fevers of all kinds, and conſumptions. This ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of cold extended over America as well as Europe, in the ſame winter.</p>
                  <p>A peſtilence raged in the north of Europe from the years 1702 to 1711, of which we have an account in Philoſophical Tranſactions, No. 337.</p>
                  <bibl>Baddam's Memoirs, vol. 6. p. 5.</bibl>
                  <p>It has been obſerved already that the plague raged in the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, in the firſt years of the preſent century. In 1702, the ſame year, it will be noted, in which the terrible ſmall-pox raged
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:036687_0224_100AA2ADA65D6558"/>
in Boſton and bilious plague in New-York, the plague broke out in Poland, near Pickzow, ſoon after an unfortunate battle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Swedes and Saxons. No ſuggeſtion appears that the diſeaſe was caught by infection from a diſtant country, nor that the fetor of dead carcaſes was ſuppoſed to generate the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. On theſe important points we are left in the dark. All that is recorded is, that it <hi>firſt began</hi> near Pickzow in Poland, ſoon after a battle. It ſpread in 1703, 4 and 5 over Poland, and into parts of Hungary and Ruſſia, ſweeping away vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of inhabitants. In 1706 we hear nothing of it. In 1707 it broke out in Warſaw, with great mortality. In 1708 it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Thorn, and parts of Poliſh Pruſſia.</p>
                  <p>This approach of the diſeaſe alarmed the people of Dantzick —public prayers were ordered in the churches—all commerce and communication with infected places were forbid—no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize from infected or ſuſpected places was permitted to enter the city, and the magiſtrates neglected no meaſure that could guard the public ſafety. All travellers and ſtrangers were ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, and none permitted to enter without ſufficient proofs that they came from healthy and uninfected places. Theſe and other ſtrict regulations were enjoined in July 1708; but notwithſtanding theſe precautions, "the diſtemper gradually inſinuated itſelf, for in March 1709, there died out of one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict in the old town ſeven perſons, and another perſon, being ill, was ſent to the hoſpital, where the diſeaſe ſoon ſpread." Dr. Gottwald, the author of this account, viſited the hoſpital on the 16th of the ſame month, and found many perſons ill—"ſome had buboes, others carbuncles, others gangrenous ulcers, which he could not determin to be peſtilential, but which he judged to be ſymptoms, if not of the plague already commenced, at <hi>leaſt of ſomething, but little inferior to it, and certain forerunners of that deſtructive diſtemper.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>In the preceding account, we obſerve the utter inſufficiency of laws and regulations to prevent the introduction of the plague into cities; and the uncertainty of phyſicians at firſt as to the nature of the diſeaſe. The facts ſtated prove the diſeaſe to have been generated on the ſpot, and to have been <hi>progreſſive</hi> from
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:036687_0225_100AA2AF2E0C21B8"/>
malignant fevers to the real plague. I have no bills of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in Dantzick for the preceding years, but if any ſuch are on record, it will appear, that the approach of the plague was indicated in that city by malignant diſeaſes and increaſed mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, for ſome months or perhaps a year or two preceding.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe ſpread ſlowly at firſt, but in July and Auguſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came general—it was at its height in September, and gradually declined till the cloſe of the year. The number of victims was nearly 25,000.</p>
                  <p>From the very accurate hiſtory of this peſtilence by Dr. Gottwald, the following circumſtances are to be collected.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. That the diſtemper firſt made its appearance in a part of the old town, called Raumbaum. What its ſituation is, may be ſeen in Buſching; a part of the city built on a ſtream which falls into the Viſtula—low of courſe—a place of buſineſs, and its ſtreets dirty.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. The diſeaſe, after its firſt appearance, lay lurking for a long time, in the ſuburbs of the city, and its progreſs was not perceivable, for two or three months. This correſponds with its phenomena in London and other places; and proves that cold or favorable weather ſuſpends or checks the action of the peſtilential principle.</p>
                  <p n="3">3d. It was moſt fatal to the poor—people in good condition moſtly eſcaped. The ſame was obſerved at Copenhagen in 1711.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. Its decreaſe was gradual, as well as its increaſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. Many of the inhabitants, tho they took never ſo much care to avoid the diſtemper, kept at home, ſuffered no infected perſon to approach them, and uſed all manner of preſervatives, "yet caught the infection."</p>
                  <p n="6">6th. The diſeaſe was preceded, in 1708, by extraordinary numbers of ſpiders. The ſame preſage has been obſerved on other occaſions.</p>
                  <p n="7">7th. While this diſtemper was raging, on the 11th of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, an offenſive miſt was obſerved, like a thick cloud, but of ſhort duration. It returned in the afternoon, from the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, ſo thick as to darken the air. Its color was that of the effluvia from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fferveſcence of the oil of vitriol with oil of tartar, a blackiſh yellow.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="222" facs="unknown:036687_0226_100AA2B1EB6C5928"/>8th. In the beginning of October appeared over the city a blue fiery globe or meteor, which came from the north weſt, in the night, ſhot towards the town rapidly, illuminating the city, and fell to the ſouth.</p>
                  <p n="9">9th. Crows, ſparrows and other birds did not make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance during the peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>In 1708 and 9 the plague deſolated Livonia. In 1710 the diſeaſe appeared in Sweden; 30,000 perſona periſhed by it in Stockholm, and other parts of the kingdom did not eſcape. Hiſtorians relate, that in the latter part of the laſt century and beginning of the preſent, the ſweating ſickneſs and great plague in Sweden deſtroyed ſeveral hundred thouſand lives, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which Sweden is leſs populous than formerly.</p>
                  <bibl>Williams's Obſ. vol. 1. p. 638. Univerſal Hiſt. vol. 35. 458.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1710 alſo the territory of Lithuania was ravaged by peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence.</p>
                  <p>In 1711 Copenhagen loſt 25,000 citizens by the ſame mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ady.</p>
                  <p>It is proper to remark how extenſively peſtilence prevailed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the great catarrh and terribly ſevere winter of 1709.</p>
                  <p>Nor did America eſcape the operation of the general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. A body of troops under Gen. Nicholſon, deſtined to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with a fleet from England, in the reduction of Canada, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>camped near Wood Creek in the province of New-York, and in July and Auguſt were attacked with a diſtemper which made dreadful havoc and obliged them to decamp. Some of the men died as if they had been poiſoned. This circumſtance gave riſe to a report which Charlevoix gravely relates, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians had poiſoned the water of the creek, by throwing into it all the ſkins of beaſts they had taken in hunting. The diſeaſe was probably the lake fever or a malignant dyſentery. This happened in 1709.</p>

                  <p>England alſo felt the influence of the ſame general principle, as appears from the bill of mortality for 1710. In France, England and the Low Countries raged a catarrhous fever to
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:036687_0227_100AA2B5EEFB1598"/>
which was given the name of Dunkirk rant. In ſome places prevailed a ſpotted fever, as at Norwich.</p>

                  <p>In 1712 prevailed catarrh in Europe, with ſore throats. Whether catarrh prevailed in America alſo, I can obtain no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. The ſeaſons in England were exceſſively wet, and corn was rotten or mildewed. The winter was ſevere, there was an eruption of Veſuvius and an earthquake. From theſe circumſtances, I ſuſpect the approach of a comet, but have found no account of any.<note n="*" place="bottom">Since the text was prepared for the preſs, I have found an account of a comet in 1712. My ſuſpicions therefore were well founded.</note>

                  <p>In October 1712 commenced a mortal ſickneſs in the town of Waterbury, in Connecticut, which raged for eleven months. It was ſo general that nurſes could ſcarcely be found to tend the ſick. What the diſeaſe was, I am not informed; but not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably it was that ſpecies of putrid pleuriſy, which has ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made dreadful havoc in America.</p>
                  <bibl>Trumbull's Hiſt. of Connecticut, 386.</bibl>
                  <p>In the ſame year, prevailed a ſore throat in London, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with dizzineſs and pain in the limbs.</p>
                  <p>In 1713 prevailed the meaſles in America, cotemporary with epidemic peſtilence in Europe.</p>
                  <p>In 1712 and 13, the plague was epidemic in Vienna, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, Stiria and other eaſtern countries. This diſeaſe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by the ſpotted fever, which gradually changed to plague. At the ſame time, whole countries were overrun with inſects.</p>
                  <bibl>Short, vol. 2. 10.</bibl>
                  <p>In England prevailed a fever which Mead has pronounced to have been of the ſame kind, as the ſweating ſickneſs in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century.—He ſays it was imported from Dunkirk, but how it came to be in Dunkirk, he does not inform us.</p>
                  <p>During theſe calamities among men, the beaſts of the field did not eſcape. A fatal diſtemper among cattle broke out in 1711 and raged with ſuch violence, in Italy, as almoſt to deſtroy the ſpecies. It ſpread for three or four years, and horſes periſhed by a ſimilar peſtilence. The writers who deſcribe the diſeaſe,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:036687_0228_100AA2B778321008"/>
repreſent it as a kind of plague; and all agree that it ſprung from a ſingle infected cow from Dalmatia. How this cow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came infected, they do not inform us. The truth is the diſeaſe was an epidemic, tho very infectious; and that it did not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily originate in infection, is proved by its appearing in many other parts of Europe.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe began with rigors, which were followed by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fever, with eruptions like thoſe of the ſmall-pox, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in five, ſix or ſeven days.</p>
                  <bibl>Baddam's Mem. vol. 6. 72. Lanciſius p. 154.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1714 began in Europe a ſeries of dry ſummers. This year was rather ſickly in England, and cattle alſo periſhed by an infectious diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>In 1715 the ſmall-pox and meaſles were epidemic in England. In the ſame year, Plymouth in Maſſachuſetts loſt 40 of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants by a malignant diſeaſe, but no particulars are known.</p>

                  <p>In 1716 the winter was exceſſively ſevere, and a fair was held on the Thames. The rivers in Europe, even in Italy, were covered with ice.</p>

                  <p>In 1720 happened the laſt great plague in Marſeilles, on which occaſion has been publiſhed "Traité de la peſte," a treatiſe in quarto, by Chicoyneau, under the ſanction of the French king, in which great efforts are made to prove the diſeaſe to have been imported from the Levant.</p>
                  <p>The proofs of importation ſtand thus. "Capt. Chataud left Said in Syria in January 1720, with a clean patent. The plague was not then in Said, tho it broke out ſoon after. On the paſſage, ſeveral perſons died, and the phyſicians at Leghorn, where the ſhip ſtopped, pronounced their diſeaſe to be "a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant peſtilential fever."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="226" facs="unknown:036687_0230_100AA2BD876E09E0"/>The ſhip arrived at Marſeilles, and ſome perſons who had concern with the goods, died in May. The ſuſpected goods were ſubjected to fifteen days retreat and purification—they were forbid to be introduced into the city—the porters were ſhut up; but all regulations were fruitleſs. In June, deaths appeared in the city with diſtinctive marks of the plague."</p>
                  <p>On ſuch flimſey evidence do the ſticklers for the ſole propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the plague by infection, ground all their aſſertions reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the diſeaſe at Marſeilles!</p>
                  <p>But it happens in this caſe, as in moſt ſimilar inſtances, that the pretended proofs of infection carry refutation in the very face of them.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, it is an acknowledged fact, that at the time the ſhip left Said, the plague had not appeared in that port, or town. It was at Aleppo and in other places far diſtant in 1719, but had not broke out in Said. How, in the name of reaſon, could men or goods be infected, when the diſeaſe did not exiſt in the place?</p>
                  <p>To overcome or rather to evade the force of this objection, the writers on the ſubject are compelled to reſort to <hi>ſuppoſition.</hi> They ſay it is <hi>poſſible,</hi> the plague might have been in the place, tho not known or generally admitted. And here reſts their whole argument!</p>
                  <p>It is true, that ſome of the ſeamen or paſſengers died on the paſſage, with a malignant peſtilential fever. But in this caſe, the malady originated on board the ſhip—and the infection is not traced to the Levant ports. There is an end of the chain—the diſeaſe began <hi>without infection,</hi> on board the ſhip, as malignant fevers have done in thouſands of other ſhips.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is admitted by Dr. Mead himſelf, p. 255, that from the time of the ſailors' death, after the ſhip arrived, it was full ſix weeks before the diſeaſe was known in the city of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles; a circumſtance that renders it nearly impoſſible that there could have been any propagation of the diſtemper by infection. To remove this objection, the advocates of infection again reſort <hi>to ſuppoſition.</hi> They <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> it poſſible ſome latent ſeeds of the diſeaſe had been concealed in goods, or clothes—and ſuch ridic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulous ſuggeſtions are made the grounds of aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="unknown:036687_0231_100AA2BF0FB42FF8"/>But what completely refutes all theſe idle ſuppoſitions, is, that we have full evidence, that the plague in Marſeilles was generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the city, and gradually aroſe from milder diſeaſes. In the beginning of the "Traitè de la peſte," it is ſtated from Mon. Didier and not denied, that "the preceding year 1719 was a barren year—the corn, the wine and the oil, were defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The heat of ſpring was exceſſive and followed by great rains, with weſterly winds—the fruits were bad. In this year a peſtilential fever appeared in Marſeilles, of which many died, and <hi>in ſome, appeared buboes, carbuncles and paroitides.</hi>"</p>
                  <p>Here we obſerve facts that always exiſt, before the plague, and which demonſtrate the uniform operations of the laws of nature. The year 1718 began to exhibit malignant diſeaſes in greater numbers than uſual. In 1719 the plague broke out at Aleppo, and in the north and weſt of Europe, malignant fevers became in many places, epidemic and peſtilential. In 1720, the peſtilential ſtate of the air, arrived at its criſis in Marſeilles. The peſtilence in Europe exhibited a <hi>regular progreſs,</hi> from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary typhus fever to the plague. A fatal ſmall-pox and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fever prevailed in Piemont.</p>
                  <p>To demonſtrate this fact, the reader will only turn to the bills of mortality in London, Amſterdam, Vienna, Dreſden, &amp;c. for the years under conſideration, and obſerve every where the effects of a general unhealthy ſtate of air, in the increaſe of the number of deaths.—The bills of mortality in Boſton and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia alſo prove this ſtate of air to have extended to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and the malignancy of it ſeems to have abated in America after 1721, in which year the ſmall-pox was very mortal in Boſton.</p>
                  <p>The accounts of diſeaſes in America, at this period, are few and imperfect. Tradition has preſerved the memory of deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſickneſs, at various times and in various places, ſome of which, I ſuſpect, refer to this period, but I am not able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the dates, with any certainty.<note n="*" place="bottom">My father mentions an inſtance, which he believes to have been not long before his birth, which was in 1722. An aged lady of 96, who was born in 1702, informs me that a malignant pleuriſy raged when ſhe was 17 years old; this fixes the period in 1719.</note> By accident however,

I am able to determin poſitively the peſtilential ſtate of air in America in 1720. A genuine letter is extant, from Thomas Hacket of Duck Creek, now in the ſtate of Delaware, dated April 10th 1720, in which he ſtates that a mortality prevailed in that place, which exceeded that in London in 1665, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt depopulated the village. I have ſeen the letter in poſſeſſion of Dr. Ruſh.</p>
                  <p>In 1721 there was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland. A dreadful dyſentery raged in Upper Saxony.</p>
                  <p>In 1720 there was a great earthquake in China, and in 1721 ſhocks were felt in the Mediterranean, by Dr. Shaw who was then on his travels to the eaſt.—In October 1720, fire aroſe out of the ſea near Tercera, one of the Azores, and a ſmall iſland aroſe.</p>

                  <p>In 1722, the ſeaſons were cold, wet and rainy. In Auguſt happened a moſt violent ſtorm in Jamaica and S. Carolina. In May an earthquake in Chili.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1722-3 was cold and dry in England. In 1723 appeared a comet, and on the 24th of February, O. S. a mighty tempeſt which is recorded among the memorabilia of America. The wind blew violently from the ſouthward, then veered ſuddenly to the eaſtward and northward, bringing in a tide which roſe two or three feet above the Long Wharf in Boſton, and flowed over all the lower part of the town, filling cellars and deſtroying property to a great amount. Immenſe damage was ſuſtained in all the maritime towns.</p>

                  <p>The confluent ſmall-pox raged in England See the London bill of mortality for 1723. Dyſenteries, pleuriſies and other inflammatory complaints prevailed in the different ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>The bilious plague prevailed in Barbadoes, ſaid to be import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Martinico. We are not informed from whence it came into Martinico. In theſe accounts of infections, we are not led to the end of the chain.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame year 1723 prevailed in many parts of the colony of Rhode-Iſland, a fatal diſeaſe called the "burning ague." It was particularly fatal, near Providence, between Pautucket
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:036687_0233_100AA2C30AD47DD0"/>
and Pautuxet. In proportion to its patients, no diſeaſe in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metica, was ever more mortal. It did not prevail in a large town, but in villages, and perhaps the clearing of ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring ſwamps might have been one cauſe of the diſeaſe. The year however was leſs healthy than uſual. A diſeaſe of the ſame name is noted once or twice in ancient hiſtory. See the year 1001.</p>
                  <p>The year 1724 in England was moſtly wet and cold; the whooping cough prevailed; but the year was generally healthy.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1725 was alſo wet and cold in England. In January a ſevere froſt produced many inflammatory complaints. In this year happened violent earthquakes in South-Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, and eruptions from two volcanic mountains in Iceland. I have no account of the weather and diſeaſes in America. I only learn from an old gentleman, that one of the winters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 1722 and 1725 was called, "the hard winter."</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1726-7 was changeable in England, but moſtly cold with great ſnows. Remitting fevers prevailed in ſummer and inflammatory, in winter, which ſwelled the bills of mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to an unuſual degree. At the ſame time the plague raged in Egypt.</p>
                  <p>The ſame winter in America was milder than uſual—the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of 1727 was very hot and dry. See Dudley's account of the great earthquake.</p>

                  <p>In 1728 putrid fevers were frequent—the ſummer was cold in England and the following winter ſevere. The year 1727 was unproductive; corn in England was ſcarce and the ſcarcity continued into this year. An eruption of a volcano in Iceland and the plague in Egypt marked this year, 1728. The eruption in Iceland continued till 1730.</p>
                  <p>This year, 1728, the ſummer weather in South-Carolina was unuſually hot and dry. The earth was parched and the ſprings exhauſted. In Auguſt a violent hurricane occaſioned an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which ſpread over the low grounds and did incredible damage to the wharves, houſes and corn fields. The ſtreets of Charleſtown were covered with boats; the inhabitants were driven to the upper ſtories of their houſes; twenty-three ſhips were driven aſhore and thouſands of trees were levelled.

                  <p>In 1729 appeared a comet, and in autumn a univerſal catarrh in Europe, and perhaps over the globe. This was preceded by meaſles. It ſeized with a ſlight chill, a ſlow fever, weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, continual hoarſeneſs, pain of the head, and difficulty of breathing. The ſuddenneſs of the attack was aſtoniſhing, and it proved fatal to many aged and phlegmatic people. Many pleuriſies and peripneumonies followed. Its firſt appearance was in Poland, Auſtria and Sileſia, and it marched over Europe in five months. At the cloſe of this epidemic in 1730, Veſuvius diſcharged its contents of fire.</p>
                  <p>In this year 1729 the plague was in Aleppo, and it will be ſeen that the bills of mortality in the north of Europe exhibit a ſickly ſtate, through a period of many years at this time. The meaſles prevailed in America, and in Farmington, Connecticut, a malignant pleuriſy.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1729 was in moſt parts of England, very wet, in other parts, dry; but this made no difference in the prevalence of the catarrh. The ſmall-pox was very frequent in England.</p>

                  <p>In 1736 and 7 a fatal ulcerous ſore throat and malignant perip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neumonies, prevailed in France.</p>
                  <p>In 1735 or 6, three or four thouſand people, in the Orkney Iſlands, periſhed with famin. The ſcarcity there in 1782 and 3 was alſo deplorable, but none periſhed.</p>

                  <p>While theſe epidemics were prevailing in Europe, America felt the peſtilential ſtate of air. In May 1735, in a wet cold ſeaſon, appeared at Kingſton, an inland town in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, ſituated in a low plain, a diſeaſe among children, commonly called the "throat diſtemper," of a moſt malignant kind, and by far the moſt fatal ever known in this country. Its ſymptoms generally were, a ſwelled throat, with white or aſh-colored ſpecks, an effloreſcence on the ſkin, great debility of the whole ſyſtem, and a tendency to putridity.</p>
                  <p>It firſt ſeized a child, who died in three days. In about a week afterwards, three children, in another family, at a diſtance of four miles, were ſucceſſively ſeized and all died on the third day. It continued to ſpread, and of the firſt forty patients, not one recovered.</p>
                  <p>In Auguſt, it appeared at Exeter, a town ſix miles diſtant. In September, it broke out in Boſton, fifty miles diſtant; altho' it did not appear in Cheſter ſix miles weſt of Kingſton, till Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. —It continued its ravages, through that year into the next, and gradually travelled ſouthward, almoſt ſtripping the country of children. Very few children eſcaped, for altho' the diſeaſe was very infectious, yet its propagation depended very little on that circumſtance. It attacked the young in the moſt ſequeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſituations, and without a poſſible communication with the ſick. It was literally the <hi>plague among children.</hi> Many families loſt three and four children—many loſt all.</p>
                  <p>In ſome places, this diſtemper was more fatal than in others—
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:036687_0238_100AA2D02BEC7608"/>
country towns ſuffered more than populous cities. And it ſhould be here remarked, that the virulence of this ſpecies of diſeaſe ſeems at times to be greatly augmented by cold and wet weather —it is moſt mild in cities where the air is, in a degree, correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of its rigor and moiſture.—To this obſervation however there are exceptions.</p>
                  <p>Scorbutic people and thoſe who lived on pork, and of courſe the poor, ſuffered moſt. In ſome families, it was comparatively mild—in others it was malignant like a plague. This diſeaſe gradually travelled weſtward and was two years in reaching the river Hudſon, diſtant from Kingſton, where it firſt appeared, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 200 miles in a ſtrait line. It continued its progreſs weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, with ſome interruptions, until it ſpread over the colonies. Few adults were affected; its principal ravages were among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under age, or rather under puberty. For many years after it was epidemic, it frequently broke out in different places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent cauſe, but did not ſpread—a ſtriking proof that ſuch diſeaſes will not become <hi>epidemic</hi> by the ſole power of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> but that ſome <hi>general cauſe</hi> muſt aid its propagation, or it will periſh in its cradle. This is probably true of every ſpecies of peſtilential diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>From an elderly lady of great obſervation in New-Haven, I have learnt that perſons who, recovered of this diſtemper, were ſubject, all their lives, to ſore throat and quinſies, and what is perhaps more remarkable, that few or none of them have lived to be old. It is at leaſt apparent, in the ſphere of her obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that thoſe perſons have died at an earlier age than others. Theſe facts are ſtriking proofs how much the whole ſyſtem, and eſpecially the ſeat of the diſeaſe, was impaired in ſtrength and firmneſs, by that diſtreſſing malady. A gentleman ſtill living, who was affected with the ſame diſeaſe in 1742, informs me that his conſtitution has never recovered from the ſhock it received from that malady.</p>
                  <p>The invaſion of this diſtemper was gradual, and for ſome time before its attack, children appeared to languiſh. It was not always attended with great proſtration of ſtrength, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:036687_0239_100AA2D1B4E4BDB0"/>
were often walking, an hour or two before their death. The ſame happened in the angina of 1794.</p>

                  <p>Diſeaſes among cattle in New Hampſhire marked this period.</p>
                  <p>In 1736, and during the rage of the ulcerous ſore throat in America and in England, the plague made terrible havoc in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt —authors relate that Cairo loſt 10,000 perſons in a day.— In Nimeguen raged a malignant dyſentery.</p>
                  <p>In 1737 while the angina maligna was ſpreading over the northern parts of America, the bilious plague prevailed in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia. In England and Scotland, the meaſles broke out and prevailed in 1735 and 6, cotemporary with the angina in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica. Dr. Short relates that the firſt perſon ſeized was a woman in her child-bed illneſs.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time prevailed miliary fevers in Cornwall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with glandular ſwellings. Coughs, defluxions and catarrhs were frequent. A peſtilential diſeaſe in Devonſhire ſwept away cattle and ſwine.</p>
                  <p>In 1737 a very ſevere influenza invaded both hemiſpheres. It commenced in November.</p>
                  <p>In 1737 alſo appeared a comet; Conſtantinople was ſhaken and Smyrna half deſtroyed by an earthquake. A ſmall ſhock was felt in Boſton. In October of this year, a ſtorm or hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane in the Eaſt-Indies, deſtroyed 20,000 veſſels of different ſizes, and 300,000 people. There was a great eruption of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius in the ſame year. In Iceland alſo was an eruption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 1730 and 1740, but the year is not ſpecified.</p>

                  <p>A moſt ſingular meteor in the ſame year, followed by a very ſevere winter.</p>
                  <p>This peſtilential conſtitution did not produce the ſame diſeaſes in England, as in France and America. The fatal ulcerous ſore throat was cotemporary in America and in France in 1737; but that diſeaſe did not appear, in its formidable array, in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land until 1742. In 1734-5 appeared its ſiſter-malady, the ſcarlet fever in Edinburg; but it ſubſided; and the epidemic
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:036687_0240_100AA2D433DDCD30"/>
took the form of meaſles of a bad type, with hoarſeneſs, defluxions and catarrh. The catarrh prevailed alſo in Barbadoes in the cloſe of this year and beginning of the next, and in New-England was a great death of fiſh and water fowl.</p>
                  <p>In 1738 ſudden deaths, vertigoes and apoplexies followed the preceding epidemics in England. The plague raged at Ockza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kow, at Barbadoes, and in New-Spain the peſtilence was ſo gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral and mortal, as to threaten the country with depopulation.</p>
                  <p>In 1739 the ſmall-pox prevailed in New-York, and ſome dyſenteries, but I hear of no remarkable occurrences in this year; except that angina maligna appeared in England in a few ſporadic caſes, but did not ſpread at that time; and an infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious fever prevailed at Charleſton.</p>

                  <p>A comet was ſeen in 1739, and the winter following in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope was the ſevereſt known ſince 1716 or perhaps ſince 1709. The cold continued till June and was ſucceeded by a dry ſeaſon; then a wet, cold autumn. A dearth ſucceeded in Scotland, and meaſles ſpread over America.</p>
                  <p>In England ſpread the whooping cough in December 1740. The ſmall-pox prevailed and in 1741 that diſeaſe, with the ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fever were very mortal.</p>

                  <p>Not leſs remarkable were the ſeaſons in America. In 1740-41, a year later than in Europe, the winter was of the ſevereſt kind. Many cattle periſhed for want of food.</p>

They aver the diſeaſe not to have been known there, anterior to that year. It was moſt fatal to ſeamen and foreigners, but the natives did not eſcape. Here we have a new ſource of yellow fever!</p>
                  <p>In 1742 the ulcerous ſore throat of a malignant kind appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in England, and continued to prevail more or leſs for many years, and in 1745 became very infectious.</p>

                  <p>The ſummer of 1742 in England was dry.</p>
                  <p>In America, the ſame angina prevailed in 1742. From 1740 to 1744 peſtilential diſeaſes prevailed in all parts of the known world.</p>
                  <p>In Syria, the winter of 1741-2 was very ſevere. In March began an acute fever in Aleppo, attended with a ſevere pain in the right hypochondrium. The plague had previouſly ſhown it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the ſea coaſt. In April, ſays Alex. Ruſſel, ſome reapers brought the infection into the neighbourhood of Aleppo. In the city, no notice was given of the plague, till the 18th of May; but on ſtrict enquiry, it was found that caſes had occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before that time. Whether the "reapers" introduced the fomites into the city, the author does not inform us.</p>
                  <p>The diſtemper made no great havoc in this ſeaſon. It abated in July, and nothing is ſaid about <hi>infection,</hi> till November, when a few more caſes occurred. In February 1743 a few caſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and in March an alarm was given. It was more general in this year, but diſappeared in 1744.</p>
                  <p>When the diſeaſe ſubſided in Aleppo, it was followed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhaeas and dyſenteries with petechiae; and ſome obſtinate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents.</p>
                  <p>In December 1742 and January 1743 were earthquakes with great ſnows, violent rains and froſt.</p>
                  <p>In 1742 a mortal fever prevailed at Holliſton in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, in which died Mr. Stone, the miniſter and fourteen of his congregation. In this year was ſeen a comet.</p>

                  <p>The year 1743 was diſtinguiſhed for a tremendous eruption of fire at Cotopaxi, a mountain in the province of Quito, five leagues north of Latacunga; all the neighboring villages were ruined by floods from the melted ſnows of the mountain. The eruption was repeated in 1744.</p>

                  <p>Venice ſuffered by an inundation in 1743, and the year was remarkable for violent ſtorms, at Boſton, Jamaica, and in many countries.</p>
                  <p>In December 1743 appeared a comet of diſtinguiſhed magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which was viſible till February of the following year. This was probably the ſame which appeared in 1401, and in both inſtances attended with peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>In 1744 ſevere catarrh ſpread over Europe. It was at Rome in February; at London in March; and in a few weeks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded England.</p>

                  <p>In 1745 Lima was ſhaken by an earthquake. An infectious fever broke out among the troops employed in the expedition to Louiſbourg. A ſimilar fever prevailed at Boſton; and how far the health of the town was affected by the returning troops, I am not informed. This was a time of general ſickneſs.</p>
                  <p>In Charleſton prevailed the infectious yellow fever, while Egypt and Smyrna were ſuffering the ravages of the plague. The bilious plague prevailed, at the ſame time, in New-York.</p>
                  <p>In this year, the town of Stamford in Connecticut was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely diſtreſſed by a malignant dyſentery, which ſwept away ſeventy inhabitants out of a few hundreds. The diſeaſe was confined to one ſtreet.</p>
                  <p>The year 1746 was probably ſtill more unhealthy. An earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake laid Lima and Calao in ruins. The concuſſion began on the 28th of October, about ſix hours before the full of the moon; and at intervals, the ſhocks were repeated for four months, in which time they amounted to four hundred and fifty. During theſe convulſions, fire burſt forth in ſeveral places of the diſtant mountains. Many days before the ſhocks began, hollow rumbling noiſes were heard in the earth, at times reſembling the diſcharge of artillery. Similar ſounds continued for ſome time after the earthquake.</p>

                  <p>Albany was, in this year, viſited by a malignant diſeaſe called by Colden, a nervous fever; and by Douglas, the yellow fever. From an old citizen, who was living in 1797, my friend Dr. Mitchell obtained the following particulars relative to that diſeaſe. The bodies of ſome of the patients were yellow—the criſis of the diſeaſe was the ninth day; if the patient ſurvived that day, he had a good chance for recovery. The diſeaſe left many in a ſtate of imbecility of mind, approaching to childiſhneſs or idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; others were afterwards troubled with ſwelled legs.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe began in Auguſt, ended with froſt, and carried off forty-five inhabitants moſtly men of robuſt bodies. It was ſaid to be imported.</p>

Such are the vulgar tales that diſgrace this age of ſcience and philoſophy. From what fairy land were imported the malignant diſeaſes, which every where ſwelled the bills of mortality in the ſame year?—Not that I would inſinuate that diſeaſes of a certain kind are not infectious. A peſtilential fever originated in the Chebucto fleet, under the Duke D'Anville, which landed an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on our ſhores in this ſame year, and one third of the Indians who viſited the cantonments, died. There the diſeaſe ſubſided, without becoming epidemic.</p>

                  <p>At Zurich in Switzerland and in Saxony prevailed a very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant dyſentery. Indeed for a number of years, at this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, dyſentery was epidemic in many parts of Europe and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</p>
                  <p>In 1747 prevailed epidemic catarrh in America and Europe. In the ſame year the bilious plague prevailed in Philadelphia.—In 1748, in Charleſton. The ſame years were ſickly in Boſton.</p>
                  <p>In 1747 appeared a comet, and Etna, which had been quiet more than forty years, commenced her diſcharges of fire and lava. In the Weſt-Indies, a tremendous hurricane laid waſte the Iſlands.</p>

                  <p>It is obvious then that this was an epidemic, very well known in ſickly periods, and not dependent on local cauſes. From Dr. Trumbull of North-Haven I have the following remarks on the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The blood was very thick and ſizy; often iſſuing from the noſe and ſometimes from the eyes. The inflammation was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and ſoon produced delirium. The moſt robuſt bodies were moſt liable to the diſeaſe. A free uſe of the lancet, in the early ſtages of the diſorder, was the only effectual remedy; where the phyſicians were afraid to bleed, the patients all died.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Hugh Williamſon, in the ſecond volume of the Medical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitory, has deſcribed this ſpecies of diſeaſe, which, he ſays, prevails often in Carolina in winter, eſpecially among thoſe who have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by bilious fevers in the preceding autumn. He obſerves that bleeding is uſually pernicious in that diſeaſe. Perhaps a difference of climates may make different remedies neceſſary. But in different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, the ſame diſeaſe may require different treatment. In New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that fever has uſually demanded an early uſe of the lancet.</note> This malady prevailed from November 1760 to March 1761.</p>
                  <p>I cannot learn that this ſpecies of inflammatory fever, has ever been epidemic in the northern parts of America, ſince this period. But it is a common winter fever, in the Carolinas, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſickly ſummers; and in the northern ſtates, ſporadic caſes of it occur with all its formidable ſymptoms. Inſtances will be hereafter mentioned. It is the peſtilence of winter, and rarely, if ever appears, except when peſtilential epidemics are current in ſummer. And I am not without ſuſpicions that the debility occaſioned by marſh effluvia in ſummer may prediſpoſe the ſyſtem to that fever in winter, tho not neceſſary to produce it.</p>
                  <p>In March 1761 was a ſmall ſhock of earthquake in New-England, and the ſame occurred in Iceland, Hamburg, Syria, England and South-America.</p>

In Bethlem it was cotemporary with the fever juſt mentioned. In Philadelphia it prevailed in the winter, and in Maſſachuſetts, in April. From Dr. Tufts, a reſpectable practitioner of medicin in Weymouth, I have the following deſcription of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>"The diſtemper began in April, and in May ran into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever, which proved fatal to aged people. It ſpread over the whole country and the Weſt-India iſlands. It began with a ſevere pain in the head and limbs, a ſenſation of coldneſs, ſhiverings ſucceeded by great heat, running at the noſe, and a troubleſome cough. It continued for eight or ten days, and generally terminated by ſweating.</p>
                  <p>In May, the aged who had before eſcaped, were ſeized with an affection like a ſlight cold; this, in a day or two was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by great proſtration of ſtrength, a cough, labo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, pains about the breaſt, praecordia, and in the limbs, but not acute. The countenance betrayed no great marks of febrile heat. The matter expectorated was thin, but ſlimy. As the diſeaſe advanced, the difficulty of breathing encreaſed; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration was more difficult; the matter thrown off more viſcid; at length the lungs appeared to be ſo loaded with tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious matter, that no efforts could diſlodge it, and the patient ſunk under it.</p>
                  <p>This diſorder carried with it bilious appearances—the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of ſome patients were of a yellowiſh hue. In ſome, there was an appearance of indifference or inſenſibility; and at night, a ſlight delirium."</p>

                  <p>In the ſpring of 1761 earthquakes were felt in many parts of Europe. See an account of them in An Regiſter, 1761. 92. Shocks alſo were felt in the Azores and Weſt-Indies. Theſe agitations were preciſely cotemporary with the epidemic catarrh in America. Scarcely any country eſcaped the convulſions of nature. During the peſtilence in Theſſalonica, ſhocks were felt almoſt every day. Ibm.</p>
                  <p>In the ſummer of 1761, I am informed, the infectious bilious fever prevailed in Charleſton, but I am not poſſeſſed of the details.

                  <p>In the ſpring of 1762 the influenza was epidemic in Europe. It appeared at Edinburgh in April in a few caſes; at Dublin in May; and in June was general and ſevere. It was therefore a year later than in America.</p>

The foreſt trees appeared as if ſcorched.</p>
                  <p>The winter following was equally remarkable for ſeverity, both in Europe and America. The Thames was a common highway for carriages, and the poor periſhed in the ſtreets of London.</p>

                  <p>In the extremely hot ſummer of 1762, the bilious plague pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in Philadelphia.

                  <p>In this year the plague in Aleppo came to its criſis. In 1760, died about 500 perſons; in 1761, 7000, and in 1762, 11000; after which year it ſubſided.</p>

                  <p>The ſummer of 1763 was a moiſt and unkindly ſeaſon. In Auguſt the Indians on Nantucket were attacked by the bilious plague, and between that time and February following, their number was reduced from 358 to 136. Of 258 who were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, 36 only recovered. The diſeaſe began with high fever and ended in typhus, in about five days.

Perſons of a mixed blood were attacked, but recovered. Not one died, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of full Indian blood.

                  <p>In December of the ſame year, the Indians on Martha's Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, diſtant eight leagues from Nantucket, were invaded by a like fever; not a family eſcaped, and of 52 patients, 39 died.</p>

and as exactly as the plague in Egypt, between the Iſraelites and Egyptians.</p>
                  <p>Some ſuſpicions were ſuggeſted that the diſeaſe at Nantucket might have been received from a ſhip which put in there, with ſick paſſengers, from Ireland bound to New-York; but there is no foundation for this opinion, as the diſorder broke out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arrival of the ſhip.</p>

                  <p>In Europe, the year 1763 was remarkable for diſeaſes among various ſpecies of animals. In Denmark, an epidemic catarrhal diſorder affected horſes. In Madrid, a peſtilence among dogs ſwept away multitudes—900 died in one day. In Genoa, the poultry periſhed in a ſimilar manner. In Italy, horſes and ſwine fell victims to the peſtilential principle. In France, horſes and mules; in Sweden, ſheep, horſes and horned cattle periſhed under the influence of the general cauſe.</p>

                  <p>The ſummer was remarkable for hail ſtorms, one of which totally ruined 36 villages in Maconnois in France. See the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of theſe and of the earthquakes in that year in An. Regiſ. Chronicle. Hail ſtones fell of ſizes from three to ten inches in circumference. Theſe ſtorms were numerous and many fire balls fell in various parts of England and a globe of fire was ſeen in Sweden.</p>
                  <p>Theſe hail ſtorms occurred during or near the time of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Etna. In 1764 was another eruption of Etna. In moſt parts of Europe and America, this period of peſtilence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have cloſed with the years 1762 and 3. But in Naples ſpread a malignant fever in 1764, preceded by famin, by which diſeaſe it was ſuppoſed 200,000 people periſhed. The diſeaſe

                  <p>To the epidemics above mentioned, ſucceeded a ſeries of dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteries, in the hot ſummers of 1765 and 6. In 1765, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant dyſentery raged in Berne and other parts of Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in Suabia and Auſtria. The invaſion was, in many caſes ſudden, ſays Zimmerman, without any preceding ſymptom; but more generally its approach was indicated by chills, laſſitude and other premonitory ſigns. In its progreſs, it exhibited moſt of the ſymptoms of the yellow fever of America. It was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by a putrid fever, which yielded to the dyſentery in June.</p>
                  <bibl>See Zimmerman on Dyſentery.</bibl>
                  <p>This epidemic was followed by violent and malignant pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; a circumſtance that marks its alliance with the peſtilential fever of America, and probably of all temperate climates, which is alſo ſucceeded by pleuriſy or peripneumony in winter.</p>
                  <p>In 1765 were many earthquakes in Italy, and Sweden, and a volcanic eruption at Truxillo in Spaniſh America. Dyſentery prevailed in Scotland, and intermittents in Pennſylvania and Georgia, were univerſal.</p>
                  <p>In 1766 the ſummer was every where hot and in Europe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively dry. In Germany, the Rhine was lower than in the terrible drouth of 1476, and in many places, was forded. In Scotland, the people were compelled to kill their cattle for want of fodder. The heat and drouth produced great hail ſtorms, and in autumn, were followed by inundations, one of which at Montauban, in France, ſwept away 1200 houſes. Terrible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts marked the year, and in the Weſt-Indies, thoſe hurricanes which lay the iſlands waſte, and are recorded among the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilia of the climate.

to the earth, by two millions of miles, than it had been for many ages, and in the ſpring appeared a comet.</p>
                  <p>The winter preceding this remarkable ſummer, was extremely cold in Europe. At Ratiſbon, Reaumur's thermometer was two degrees lower, than in the noted year 1709, and birds per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with cold.

This is one of the few inſtances on record, in which theſe vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canoes have been in eruption, nearly at the ſame time. The eruption of Heckla continued from April to September.

very ſevere, and at Brandywine, the mercury fell in Farenheit to 20 deg. below cypher—an unexampled degree of cold in that latitude. In January happened a thaw, which broke up the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in Connecticut, and left ſcarcely a bridge over the rivers. The cold in France in 1767-8 was more ſevere than in 1740 and within a degree of that in 1709. In Conſtantinople ſnow and hail fell as late as March 16.</p>

                  <p>In 1770, cotemporary with the clouds of flies in India and a moſt fatal peſtilence among men and cattle in Europe, appeared in America a black worm about one inch and a half in length, which devoured the graſs and corn. Never was a more ſingular phenomenon. Theſe animals were generated ſuddenly in the northern ſtates of America, and almoſt covered two or three hundred miles of country. They all moved nearly in one direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when they were intercepted by furrows, in plowed land, they fell into them in ſuch numbers as to form heaps. They ſought ſhelter in the graſs, a hot ſun being fatal to them. They diſappeared ſuddenly about the cloſe of June and beginning of July.</p>

                  <p>This year, 1773, was in general ſickly. In America, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles finiſhed its courſe and was followed by diſorders in the throat.

                  <p>About this time, for the year is not recollected, there was an eruption of fire at Derby, in Connecticut, a few rods from Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatuck river; the only inſtance ever known in that place.

                  <p>The ſummer of 1776 in America was hot and in the northern ſtates rainy.

                  <p>It has been cuſtomary to aſcribe the prevalence of this mortal diſeaſe to infection ſpread by the ſoldiers who returned home from the armies.

                  <p>The acquieſcence of all deſcriptions of men, learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, in the opinion that epidemic diſeaſes are to be aſcribed ſolely to infection or ſpecific contagion, has proved extremely injurious to philoſophy and to medicin.<note n="*" place="bottom">A man in my father's neighborhood, was drafted to perform a tour of military duty at New-York, during the revolution-war.

                  <p>Not only all the rivers, but the harbors and bays in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, as far ſouthward as Virginia, were faſt bound with ice. Loaded ſleds paſſed from Staten-Iſland to New-York; the ſound between Long-Iſland and the main land was frozen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſolid highway, where it is ſeveral miles in breadth.

                  <p>The ſnow was nearly four feet deep, in Atlantic America, for at leaſt three months. The winter was ſevere in Europe alſo; and on the 14th of January, the mercury at Glaſgow fell to 46 deg. below 0.</p>

The heavens were obſcured with a vapor or cloud of a yellow color or faint red. The cloud which occaſioned the principal darkneſs, paſſed over Connecticut about the hours of 9 and 10, and continued till after twelve. In the greateſt obſcuration, a candle was neceſſary to enable perſons to read. For ſome days before, the atmoſphere was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with vapor.</p>

                  <p>On the ſame day that this lurid vapor overſpread ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles of country in America, Etna began to diſcharge lava from a new mouth, between two and three miles from its crater. The lava divided into three ſtreams of a quarter of a mile in breadth, and in a few days ran fourteen miles. Violent earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes accompanied and followed the eruption. The coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe events, in point of time, well deſerves notice. The great diſcharges from Veſuvius and a volcano in the Arctic regions in 1779, the terrible earthquakes, ſevere cold and erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of fire that followed, may perhaps lead us to a rational ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the phenomenon of the <hi>dark day</hi>—which has not hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto been explained.</p>

                  <p>The plague broke out in Smyrna in the ſpring of 1780 but I have no account of its progreſs.</p>
                  <p>The ſpring was cool and dry, and catarrhous complaints were prevalent among children, ſays Dr. Ruſh, vol. 1. 123. The ſummer following was hot,<note n="*" place="bottom">At Hartford, July 8th, the Thermometer at half after 11 A M. was at 102, at 2 P. M. 99 and an half, two degrees higher than it had been ſince 1772.</note> and a bilious remittent was epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic in Philadelphia, accompanied with ſuch acute pains in the back, hips and neck, as to obtain the name of the <hi>break-bone-fever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the midſt of ſummer, but I do not recollect the preciſe time, appeared the moſt ſingular halo about the ſun which I ever beheld. I wrote a particular deſcription of it, at the time, which is miſlaid, and therefore I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe it
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:036687_0272_100AA255C49CA230"/>
from recollection.—Haloes are among the moſt certain forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of tempeſtuous weather.</p>
                  <p>On the 2d of October the leeward Weſt-India iſlands expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced a moſt dreadful hurricane; and on the 11th the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward iſlands were almoſt laid waſte by a ſimilar calamity. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes which is leaſt ſubject to theſe tempeſts, was laid deſolate; and it was eſtimated that 6000 ſouls periſhed. Houſes, planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-buildings, wharves, piers, ſhipping were all overwhelmed in one general ruin. It is ſaid that, during the tempeſt, ſome of the iſlands experienced an earthquake. Courant, Dec. 12, 1780. Jan. 9, 1781 and Jan. 23, 1781. As hurricanes are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by diſcharges of electricity, ſome trembling of the earth almoſt always attends thoſe which are violent, and flaſhes of fire are viſible. Indeed the atmoſphere appears to be a ſheet of fire. Similar diſcharges of electricity attended the tempeſtuous earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake that deſtroyed Nicomedia in 358—that which defeated Julian's attempt to rebuild Jeruſalem in 362—the hail-ſtorm in Egypt, in the time of Moſes—and that which happened at Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua in 1785, to be hereafter related.</p>
                  <p>The canker-worm made extenſive ravages in this period; but I cannot ſtate their riſe and decline in different parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The winter of 1780-81 exhibited nothing worthy of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpring of 1781 prevailed the influenza, or epidemic catarrh. It began with a ſevere pain in the head, proſtration of ſtrength, coldneſs and chills, the pulſe not quick nor tenſe. The pain in the head laſted about twenty-four hours, and was ſucceeded by a pain in the ſide, not pointed nor acute, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the hips, accompanied with a ſoreneſs, and reſembling a rheumatic pain. The cough was troubleſome, full, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcharged of the glandular kind, not well concocted. Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration was difficult, and a conſiderable defluxion on the lungs. In a few caſes, the diſorder terminated in 7 or 8 days; but uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not till the 13th or 14th; altho the patient was ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his bed.

                     </gap>eſs and weakneſs in the ſide, which continued after the ſtrength was recovered. Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection had little effect on the pain in the ſide. Epiſpaſtrics ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the part gave relief. The diſorder was ſeldom fatal, but

                  <p>In the ſummer following no particular phenomena occurred; the elements were in their uſual ſtate, ſo far as my information extends; and in general the country enjoyed good health. A malignant fever prevailed, in ſome degree, in New-York, but excited no great alarm.</p>
                  <p>One year after this influenza in America, the ſame diſeaſe pervaded the eaſtern hemiſphere. Its progreſs was from Siberia and Tartary weſtward; and it reached Europe in April and May 1782: I have no account of its courſe in America, but it ſeems to be probable, that it took its direction from America weſtward, and paſſing the Pacific in high northern latitudes, invaded Aſia and Europe from the eaſt. This muſt have been the caſe, if the epidemic in Europe was a continuation of that in America. For an account of this epidemic, ſee the publications of that year.</p>
                  <p>In 1782 happened conſiderable earthquakes in Calabria, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which the mercury in the barometer in Scotland ſunk within the tenth of an inch of the bottom of the ſcale, and the waters in many locks in the highlands were greatly agitated.</p>

                  <p>In Britain the ſummer was univerſally wet and cold, and crops failed, in conſequence of which a diſtreſſing dearth afflicted Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the following year.</p>
                  <p>In America alſo the ſummer was cool. Two or three torna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does happened in Vermont and New-Hampſhire, with deluging rains, and in one place hail of enormous ſize—the gazette ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts ſay, pieces of ice were found of 6 inches in length.</p>
                  <p>The latter part of ſummer was exceſſively dry. In New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, a cedar ſwamp of 20 miles in length and 8 in breadth, taking fire by accident, was totally conſumed. The fire penetrated among the roots to the depth of 6 feet.—Corn, graſs, and the very foreſts withered. The air was loaded with a thick vapor, for ſome days in September.<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader will judge how far this extreme evaporation and dryneſs, indicate the action of the internal fires or electricity which produced the tremendous diſcharges from Heckla in the following year.</note>

This was but a prelude to more terrible calamities; for about ſeven o'clock P. M. a tremendous ſhock laid in ruins the greateſt part of Meſſina, Calabria and many towns and villages.

Auguſt. The country around the mountain was covered with burning fluid, to the extent of 40 miles, and in ſome places, to the depth of 40 feet. The lava ſpread over 3600 ſquare miles.</p>
                  <p>Previous to this eruption, all the ſprings and ſtreams of water in the neighborhood had been dried up; a ſure forerunner of the diſcharge of fire; and for ſome months before the eruption, the atmoſphere over the iſland was filled with a dark, bluiſh, ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous vapor or cloud, which was ſtationary in calm weather, but which was ſometimes diſperſed by winds, and ſpread over Europe.

                  <p>It is ſtill more probable that this vapor was the effect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible diſcharges of electricity, combined with aerial ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as in Sicily on the 5th and in America on the 10th of February.</p>
                  <p>In October occurred tremendous gales of wind and high tides which did no ſmall damage in the ſeaports of the United States. The firſt, on the 15th and 16th, occaſioned the higheſt water at New-Haven, which had been known in 40 years. Many other tempeſts occurred in September and October; and from Vermont to Georgia, the gazettes were filled with accounts of diſaſters from the violence of the winds and rains.</p>

                  <p>In autumn 1783 ſome parts of Europe were deluged with continual rains, and at Rome 5 or 6000 children died of the ſmall-pox. About Grenoble raged an epidemic fever.</p>
                  <p>A diſtemper among the cattle in Derby in England, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſmall alarm, and a royal proclamation was iſſued enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain precautions to prevent the propagation of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Cotemporary with theſe convulſions of nature, was a moſt deſolating plague in Egypt, the Grecian Iſles, Dalmatia, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Smyrna and in the Crimea. It is not poſſible, with the <hi>general</hi> accounts given of ſuch an epidemic, in the public prints, to ſtate, with any preciſion, its origin and progreſs in the eaſt. It is mentioned to have appeared in Smyrna, in the ſpring of 1783, and it certainly raged in Conſtantinople, and many

                  <p>In Egypt the ſame diſeaſe committed moſt terrible ravages in 1783-4 and 5. It began in November 1783. To this calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was added a ſevere famin; the inundation of the Nile, in the ſummer of that year, having proved inſufficient. So ſevere was the plague, that in the winter after 1783, fifteen hundred dead bodies were carried out of Cairo in a day; and the plague and famin of that and the ſucceeding year, was ſuppoſed to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off one ſixth of the inhabitants of Egypt. See Volney's Travels, vol. 1. 192 and 3, and Courant, Oct. 28, 1783, and Oct. 17, 1785, in which it is ſaid that in Cairo 3000 periſhed in a day in April, 1785.</p>
                  <p>We have then an exact general view of the phenomena which introduce and accompany peſtilence in Europe, Africa and Aſia —terrible earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes; exceſſive drouth in America, India and Egypt, failure of crops and famin —meteors, great heat and deluges of rain, in other countries. Let us now ſee what followed theſe abovementioned agitations of the elements, in our country.</p>

                  <p>In Auguſt 1783, the ſcarlatina appeared in Philadelphia and in September it became epidemic. It appeared about the ſame time in Salem, in Maſſachuſetts. It was in Charleſton, South-Carolina in 1784, in which year, it appeared in the interior of the northern ſtates, as in Vermont and New-Hampſhire, and in Middletown, on Connecticut river. It continued to prevail about five years; but was not ſevere in general and many towns wholly eſcaped its attacks.</p>

as May. I find it in all parts of America, in that year, but cannot trace the progreſs of the epidemic.</p>
                  <p>During this period neither dyſentery nor peſtilential autumnal fevers made any conſiderable ravages in America, as far as I can learn; except at Fell's-Point in Baltimore, where the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious peſtilential fever occaſioned a mortality in 1783. Many ſporadic caſes of a ſimilar fever appeared in various parts of the country, and almoſt a whole family in New-Jerſey periſhed by it in the autumn of that year. Fortunately however the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the elements was corrected, without producing its moſt fatal effects. Even the ſcarlet fever, with the exception of a few places, was leſs malignant than it has been in the laſt period.</p>
                  <p>This peſtilential conſtitution was felt alſo in the north of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The ſcarlatina broke out in Edinburgh in the winter of 1782-3, a few months before it did in America; but of its progreſs I have no account. It appears to have been epidemic in London in 1786; ſo that its period was of about the ſame duration as in America. The cotemporaneouſneſs of this ſpecies of diſeaſe in Great-Britain and America, deſerves particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
                  <p>In December happened a fog in Amſterdam of ſuch denſity as to occaſion complete obſcurity for three hours in the middle of the day. It was not poſſible for perſons to find their way in the ſtreets, and many paſſengers and ſome carriages fell into the canals.</p>

                  <p>The ſeverity of the winter ſucceeding theſe phenomena, both in Europe and America, correſponded with their extraordinary number and violence. The weather was leſs uniformly cold than in 1780, but the froſt, in ſome parts of the winter was moſt intenſe.

                  <p>On the 20th of January was diſcovered a comet in Piſces, which was involved in a luminous atmoſphere. It was viſible about four weeks.</p>
                  <p>The ſevere cold commenced early; the Delaware at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia was cloſed at the beginning of December, and continued bound with ice till the middle of March; notwithſtanding a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of cold and a heavy rain in January. The gazettes ſtate that ſuch intenſe cold had not been known in that city, ſince 1750-51.—The Miſſiſippi was reported to be covered with ice, as far ſouth as New-Orleans. At the breaking up of winter, the thaw was ſudden, and immenſe bodies of ice, floating down the rivers, which were greatly ſwelled, ſpread ruin along the low lands on their banks. Great damage was ſuſtained on the banks of the Schuylkill, Suſquehanna, Potomack and James rivers.</p>

                  <p>In 1783-4 the river Liffey in Ireland, the Thames in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and all the rivers in the interior of Holland, were cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſolid ice.

In 1785, it occaſioned unuſual deſtruction of wheat —and ſuch was the alarm in England, for fear it ſhould prove <hi>infectious,</hi> and be introduced into that country, that the King iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a proclamation dated June 25, 1788, prohibiting the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of American wheat.—This event excited no ſmall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs in America, eſpecially in the ſtates, whoſe ſtaple is wheat. Whereupon the Supreme Executive Council of Pennſylvania re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the opinion of the Agricultural Society, as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by which that inſect is propagated. To this requeſt, the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety returned for anſwer, their decided opinion that it is the plant alone which is injured by the inſect; that the grain is ſound and good, and that the inſect is not propagated by ſowing wheat which grew on fields infected with it.</p>

                  <p>The prohibition by the King and Council of Great-Britain was deemed a judicious precaution; but was the fruit of an error that pervades the world, reſpecting the powers of <hi>infection</hi> and <hi>contagion.</hi> The opinion of the Agricultural Society is well foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but it remains for time and the force of truth to convince the people of Philadelphia, that the yellow fever can no more be tranſplanted and rendered epidemic by infection, than the wheat-inſect. Both are <hi>diſeaſes,</hi> originating where they have a ſuitable aliment, and ceaſing to exiſt, when that aliment fails.</p>

                  <p>In Europe prevailed epidemic catarrh in 1788. It appeared at Vienna in April—was in Poland and Ruſſia in May—at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in June—and at Paris in Auguſt. In St. Luke's Hoſpital, it began on the 16th of July, and a few caſes occurred till Nov. 10th; but only twenty-five perſons out of 190 were affected; a proof that it has little contagion. Gent.

                  <p>On the 22d of July was a violent tempeſt from the N. E. which occaſioned a very high tide in the Cheſapeek, and no ſmall damage. This is a ſingular occurrence. A north-eaſt gale in June or July on the American coaſt, muſt be attributed to ſome extraordinary cauſe; and perhaps this may be aſcribed to the approach of a comet, which appeared in October and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember following.

If they were killed, it would ſeem probable that other fiſh in the ſame ſeas, would have ſhared the ſame fate; which does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been the caſe; for the accounts make no mention of the death of other kinds. And what renders it probable that they died of diſeaſe, and a diſeaſe peculiar to that kind of fiſh, it, that for ſome years after, no haddock came to the markets in Scotland, as before that mortality. That ſpecies appeared to be almoſt extinct; whereas there is no mention made of a failure of other kinds of fiſh. Careful obſervations and preciſe dates would aſſiſt our reſearches into the cauſes of theſe wonderful phenomena.</p>

                  <p>It will be obſerved that this darkneſs, and the beginning of the influenza in America coincide nearly in time with the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Veſuvius, and many earthquakes.</p>
                  <p>Such univerſal diſorders in the elements never fail to produce epidemic diſeaſes; and thoſe here related were the heralds of the moſt ſevere period of ſickneſs that has occurred in the United States for 30 years.</p>
                  <p>The firſt appearance of that ſeries of epidemics to be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcribed, ſeems to have been in the meaſles at New-York in November 1788, and at Philadelphia in December following. This diſeaſe became epidemic over the northern ſtates in 1789, but I have not the means of deſcribing its progreſs. I find, in bills of mortality, from various places, deaths by meaſles are mentioned in 1789 and 90.</p>
                  <p>In autumn 1789 appeared the influenza or epidemic catarrh. The preciſe time and place of its appearance, are not aſcertained. Some accounts ſay, it originated in Canada. But I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my obſervations to its progreſs in Atlantic America. It was firſt obſerved about the cloſe of September 1789, in New-York
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:036687_0293_100AA2324E442150"/>
and Philadelphia. Dr. Ruſh informs me, that it was brought to Philadelphia by the members of Congreſs, who returned from New-York, about the firſt of October. Another account, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by one of the faculty in Philadelphia, and publiſhed in the 7th volume of the Muſeum, mentions its firſt appearance there, about the time of the Friends Yearly Meeting, in September. The preciſe time is probably not aſcertainable; the opinion of its propagation by infection is very fallacious, as I know by repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obſervations. It probably appeared in detached caſes, ſome days before it became a ſubject of obſervation.</p>
                  <bibl>Muſeum, vol. 7. 231.</bibl>
                  <p>From the middle ſtates, it moved rapidly over the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It appeared in Hartford, where I then reſided, about the middle of October. On the 19th of that month, I left Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford for Boſton and arrived the next day in good health. I was ſeized with the influenza on the 23d, and by the aid of a dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting regimen, recovered in four days. No perſon who attended me was ſeized with the diſtemper, ſooner than the other inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that town. I mention this to diſprove the common opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of its infection; not that I deny it to be in a degree, infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; altho my own obſervations do not warrant that conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but I aver that its propagation depends almoſt entirely on the inſenſible qualities of the atmoſphere. Two ladies who left Boſton with me on the ſecond of November, before the diſeaſe had appeared in their family, and before it was a ſubject of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, were ſeized with it in Hartford, at the ſame time, that it became epidemic in Boſton, one on the 8th and the other on the 12th.—The diſeaſe had then paſſed Hartford, and there is no evidence of their being expoſed to any perſon infected. This fact ſhows a regular progreſs in the ſtate of air producing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe —as perſons leaving Boſton and travelling one hundred and twenty miles diſtance, were effected preciſely at the time the diſeaſe became epidemic in that town.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe pervaded the wilderneſs and ſeized the Indians— it ſpread over the ocean and attacked ſeamen a hundred leagues from land, and as to infection, entirely inſulated—it appeared in the West-Indies nearly at the time it did in the northern
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:036687_0294_100AA26F51271D00"/>
ſtates. It overſpread America, from the 15th to the 45th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of latitude in about 6 or 8 weeks; and how much further it extended, I am not informed.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould have been mentioned that, in September, anterior to the invaſion of the catarrh, the ſcarlatina anginoſa appeared in Philadelphia; but in October it yielded to the influenza, the controlling epidemic. The ſcarlet fever re-appeared in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and became epidemic; often blending itſelf with the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enza. It exhibited one predominant feature of the whole ſeries of ſucceeding epidemics, a prevalence of bilious matter, which was often diſcharged by purging and vomiting. This diſeaſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to prevail in Philadelphia, and if my information is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, in ſome parts of New-Jerſey, till the ſpring of 1790. The meaſles occurred in ſome caſes, but was not epidemic.</p>
                  <bibl>Muſeum, vol. 7. 120, 175.</bibl>
                  <p>It is remarkable that the ſcarlatina anginoſa was cotemporary in Edinburgh with the epidemic meaſles in America in 1789, and nearly ſo, with the death of the haddock on the coaſt of Norway.</p>
                  <p>It will be obſerved that the ſcarlet fever, tho epidemic in Philadelphia, did not ſpread over the country in 1790. It was little known in the northern ſtates, till two years after—this is among the proofs that this diſeaſe does not depend on infection for its propagation. If infection was its only or principal means of propagation, the fomites exiſted in great abundance, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular places in 1790, and ſufficient to have ſpread it over the United States. But a diſeaſe however infectious, will not ſpread far in an atmoſphere that will not generate it. Indeed ſcarcely a year paſſes in which ſporadic caſes of ſcarlatina, or anginas of other kinds do not appear in particular places; but they never ſpread without ſome uncommon concurrence of cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1789-90 was one of the mildeſt that is ever known in this country; there being little froſt, except for a few days in February. There fell frequent ſnows and in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; but they were immediately followed by warm ſoutherly winds, and diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>Early in the ſpring of 1790 we had a ſecond epidemic ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh. I was attentive to its origin and progreſs. I found it at
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:036687_0295_100AA234741D4348"/>
Albany in the laſt week in March, and heard of it in Vermont about the ſame time. I returned to Hartford, but altho expoſed repeatedly to its infection on my journey, I was not ſeized earlier than others in Hartford, where the diſeaſe appeared about the middle of April. It ſpread to the ſouthward, arrived at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia near the cloſe of that month, and diſappeared in that city about the middle of June. In the northern ſtates, as far as my knowledge extends, the diſeaſe was more violent, than in the preceding autumn. Many plethoric perſons of firm habit almoſt ſunk under it; while conſumptive people and hard drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fell its victims.</p>
                  <bibl>Muſeum, vol. 8. 65.</bibl>
                  <p>The ſpring and ſummer of 1790 were moſtly rainy; but oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erwiſe ſeaſonable weather. No remarkable epidemics prevailed, except thoſe already deſcribed, but an increaſe of mortality, in ſome places, is viſible in the regiſters of deaths. Severe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes occurred on the African coaſt.</p>
                  <p>Let it be obſerved that the meaſles appeared in autumn 1788, juſt after great volcanic eruptions, and a moſt tempeſtuous ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when the element of fire appeared to be in univerſal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion; juſt after the meteor, and during the appearance of the comet.<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1732 a dark day occurred in Auguſt <hi>preceding</hi> the influenza.

                  <p>The winter of 1790-91 commenced early and with ſevere weather. The laſt week in November was cold; Connecticut river at Hartford was cloſed with ice on the 9th of December, and not open till the 12th of March. On the whole, the ſeaſon was not of unuſual ſeverity. The ſpring and early part of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were, in moſt parts of the country, very dry, until the middle of June.</p>
                  <p>On the 15th of January, a conſiderable ſhock of earthquake was experienced at Richmond in Virginia. At the ſame time catarrhs were ſo prevalent in that ſtate and in Pennſylvania, as to excite an apprehenſion of another viſit of the influenza.
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:036687_0296_100AA271946FF2E8"/>
Inflammatory diſeaſes were very frequent during the winter. In Philadelphia the ſcarlatina anginoſa appeared late in January and was very prevalent in February. In the interior of Carolina it was ſickly, but I have no particulars. The whooping cough prevailed in many parts of the country.</p>

                  <p>To theſe phenomena ſucceeded in Connecticut the generation of millions of that ſpecies of black worm, deſcribed under the year 1770. I believe they were far leſs numerous than in 1770; they however appeared in Hartford and in Norwich, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared at the ſame time.

                  <p>At this period the peſtilential or epidemic conſtitution of the atmoſphere began to ſhow itſelf in the infectious yellow fever. It appeared in New-York, in autumn, along the eaſt river, and carried off about 200 perſons. This gave ſome alarm, which ſoon ſubſided.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be noted that the meaſles in 1788, the diſeaſe which marched in the van of this ſeries of epidemics, appeared firſt in New-York—this was probably the fact alſo in regard to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenza of the ſucceeding year—and the ſcarlatina anginoſa at the cloſe of 1792. The ſcarlatina of 1789 and 91 in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia was local, or if it appeared in a few other places, it did not ſpread over the country. All the laſt great epidemics have ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated nearly in the ſame longitude between Connecticut and Pennſylvania. It is not to be concluded from this fact that they have been propagated by infection from one ſpot, as from a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; we know this is not the fact; the ſame diſeaſes originating in remote places.<note n="*" place="bottom">The mild ſcarlatina, the herald of the epidemic, appeared at New-York and at Bethlem in Connecticut, in 1792, in the ſame month.</note> But it ſerves to ſhow that the cauſe or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of diſeaſe in the elements is of various force, and will firſt ſhow its effects in places where it has the most ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame ſummer of 1791, the peſtilential principle began to exhibit its effects in the increaſed malignancy of the tropical fevers. The "unuſual epidemic fever" in Grenada, deſcribed by Dr. Chiſholm, in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries for 1793, and which was the occaſion of no ſmall ſurpriſe, was the commencement of that ſeries of fatal diſeaſes, which, in ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent years, made dreadful havoc in the Iſlands. This fever became ſo violent and infectious, contrary to the common fever
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:036687_0299_100AA239266FA920"/>
of the tropics, that a labored attempt was made to trace it to fomites from the coaſt of Africa. The truth is, the fever was nothing more than the common fever of the climate, with the ſuper added malignancy derived from the exiſting conſtitution of the elements. The ſame fact took place on the African coaſt; that is, the uſual fevers of the climate became more malignant.</p>
                  <p>This idea is ſuggeſted by a ſeries of ſimilar events in other cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates; all the diſeaſes of America, at the ſame time, aſſuming a ſimilar augmented violence, and ſporadic caſes of malignant fever appearing in all parts of our country. Such has been the fact in all other epidemic periods.</p>
                  <p>To confirm this idea, let it be obſerved that in the ſame year, when this malignant fever appeared in the African Seas on board of ſhips, in Grenada, and in New-York, as well as in ſporadic caſes in other parts of America, the plague carried off two or three hundred thouſand people,<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe numbers are to be ſuſpected of exaggeration.</note> in Egypt, and raged in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople with great mortality. In all theſe diſtant countries, the ſame or ſimilar effects were nearly cotemporary. The plague in Egypt continued into the next year; but I have no details of its progreſs and termination.

able to prove, that this diſeaſe in Connecticut, was progreſſive in a remarkable manner, and from the fact, which I believe is not uncommon, will be drawn moſt important conſequences.</p>
                  <p>The autumn was one of the mildeſt ever known, November was ſo warm that we ſat with open windows, at Hartford, on the 19th of the month.

                  <p>In the courſe of this winter and the ſpring ſucceeding, the ſcarlet fever raged in New-York, with conſiderable mortality. It became epidemic alſo in Philadelphia, in the courſe of the ſpring months.</p>
                  <p>Catarrh was very prevalent in the northern ſtates, at the ſame time; and the ſmall-pox by inoculation at Hartford proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſually obſtinate and fatal; indicating an inſalubrious ſtate of the atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>In February 1793 the ſcarlet fever invaded the town of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, like "an armed man," ſays Mr. Backus, Medical Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, vol. 1. 524.

                  <p>We have here diſtinct marks of progreſſion. The diſeaſe in a mild form appeared in Auguſt 1792, then diſappeared. In February following, it invaded the town in its worſt form. Six months therefore intervened between its precurſor, or mild form, and its invaſion with full force.</p>
                  <p>The ſame diſeaſe appeared in the neighboring diſtrict of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and in diſtant parts, in nearly the ſame longitude, in the courſe of this year; but I have not materials for a detail of facts.</p>

                  <p>In September and October of this year, about the time the diſtemper ſubſided in Bethlem, it began to exhibit appearances of approach, in the maritime towns of Connecticut. Its precur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors at New-Haven, as deſcribed by Dr. Monſon, a good judge of the ſubject, were "ſlight influenza, ſlinging pains in the jaws and limbs, ſoreneſs in the muſcles of the neck, with a ſlight fever."</p>
                  <p>In November and December following, ſeveral caſes of ulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſore throat occurred, but they had a favorable iſſue, and the ſymptoms were not alarming.</p>
                  <p>In January 1794 arrived the criſis of this diſeaſe; it put on its malignant ſymptoms, and in the courſe of the ſix following months, ſeized more than ſeven hundred perſons, principally youth, of whom died fifty two.</p>
                  <bibl>See Dr. Monſon's account in my Collection, p. 173.</bibl>
                  <p>Here again is diſtinctly marked a regular progreſſion of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms from September to January; the precurſors being four or five months in advance of the diſeaſe in its moſt violent form.</p>
                  <p>In Hartford, on Connecticut river, about thirty miles eaſt of Litchfield and Bethlem, I had an opportunity to make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal obſervations on the origin and progreſs of this epidemic.</p>
                  <p>I do not know the date of the firſt caſe: but in my own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oranda, its appearance in my eldeſt daughter, then in the 3d year of her age, is noted under the 12th of May 1793. The attending phyſician informed me, that the diſeaſe was then epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic. Its firſt appearance therefore muſt have been a week or two earlier.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe was a mild ſcarlatina anginoſa. The patient had conſiderable fever—the parosiſms were daily, and terminated in proſuſe ſweats—there was a partial effloreſcence of the ſkin about the neck and breaſt, and ſome affection of the throat. Its criſis,
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:036687_0303_100AA325F7FFD890"/>
if I do not miſremember, was about the eighth day. I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in no caſe, did this diſeaſe prove mortal, during this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion.</p>
                  <p>The reader will obſerve the dates—this mild angina invaded Hartford in April and May, about the time, the ſeverity of the diſeaſe began to abate in Bethlem.</p>
                  <p>Nine months after the invaſion of this mild angina, that is, in February 1794, this diſeaſe appeared in Hartford in its formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble array, and many children became its victims.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can prove more clearly that infection had no concern in the origin of this diſtemper, than this gradual augmentation of its ſymptoms. If any fact were neceſſary to demonſtrate the all-controlling influence of the elements, in the propagation and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the diſeaſe, this <hi>progreſſion</hi> alone would be ſufficient. The mild epidemic of May 1793, was the ſame ſpecies of diſeaſe with that which was then deſtroying life, in the weſtern parts of the ſtate, and in New-York and Pennſylvania; but the condition of the atmoſphere at Hartford was not, at that time, fitted to give the diſeaſe its full degree of violence. The ſummer ſeaſon perhaps ſuſpended the operation of the general cauſe, by means to us unknown. In February following arrived the criſis of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether other epidemic anginas have been charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized by the ſame progreſſiveneſs in the ſymptoms. It is not improbable that they have; and that age after age has paſſed away, without noticing the circumſtance; a circumſtance that throws more light on the origin, cauſes and philoſophy of epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics, than all the diſſertations on the ſubject, ſince the days of Hippocrates.</p>
                  <p>My own children were affected with the mild angina in May. I removed, with my family, to New-York in November 1793, <hi>before</hi> the fatal angina invaded Hartford, and <hi>after</hi> it had finiſhed its courſe in New-York; my children eſcaped its violence, and probably in conſequence of this removal. This was an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal circumſtance in my family, but I ſuſpect a ſimilar removal of children, during the progreſs of that malady, might ſave a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of lives; altho the circumſtances of many people will not
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:036687_0304_100AA2EE2AE775A0"/>
permit them to avail themſelves of the expedient; and in ſome caſes probably it would fail of ſucceſs. It however deſerves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. The angina had completed its courſe in New-York in 1793 or nearly. It did not invade Boſton till 1795. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the children from the atmoſphere of Boſton in 1795, to an atmoſphere where the diſeaſe had ceaſed, would probably have ſecured moſt of them from an attack.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1793 was exceſſively hot, after a dry ſpring, and produced a great number of violent guſts, with rain and hail. The autumn was very dry. A fatal dyſentery prevailed in Georgetown, on the Potomak, and in the vicinity, which ſwept away many hundreds of the inhabitants. The ſame diſeaſe prevailed in Coventry, in Connecticut, and killed almoſt every perſon whom it ſeized. A nervous or long fever prevailed in Wethersfield. In ſhort, in moſt parts of the United States, the peſtilential principle exhibited its effects, in ſome form or other, and every where ſwelled the bills of mortality. It extended to the Weſt Indies, and ſo violent was the epidemic at Grenada, that the phyſicians and inhabitants, unable to account for it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuppoſed it an imported diſeaſe. The treatiſe written by Dr. Chiſholm to prove it imported, is ſatisfactory evidence to me that the diſeaſe was an epidemic. The diſeaſe correſponds in its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal character, with the peſtilential fevers of this country, many of which are known to be generated in our own climate.</p>
                  <p>In Auguſt 1793 commenced in Philadelphia that dreadful peſtilence which alarmed the United States, and ſpread terror and diſmay over that city. The ſpring diſeaſes, which uſhered in this malady, were influenza, ſcarlatina and mild bilious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents. See Ruſh's Treatiſe on that fever. Theſe are the moſt certain and immediate precurſors of peſtilence, in this country; and the influenza ſeems to be ſo, in all countries.</p>
                  <p>During this epidemic, the weather was very ſultry and dry. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 12th of September, fell a meteor between the city and the hoſpital. The number of victims to this diſeaſe was 4040.</p>
                  <p>A controverſy aroſe among the phyſicians in Philadelphia, relative to the origin of the plague, one party tracing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as they ſuppoſed, to infected veſſels from the Weſt-Indies;
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:036687_0305_100AA3281AAB4D10"/>
the other aſcribing it to exhalations from damaged coffee and filthy ſtreets. This controverſy has occaſioned an unhappy ſchiſm among the medical gentlemen, and the citizens of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia.</p>
                  <p>It is greatly to be regretted that gentlemen of the faculty committed themſelves, by prematurely giving poſitive opinions on that important queſtion, and thus laying the foundation for permanent evils to the country. It would have been wiſer to have inſtituted a regular enquiry into hiſtorical facts, relating to peſtilential diſeaſes, antecedent to any poſitive deciſions on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>By an account of the deaths in Algiers, kept by Capt. O'Brien, while a priſoner, I perceive that 4893 perſons died in 1793 by the meaſles and plague. There was a conſiderable increaſe of mortality in that year; and we obſerve the meaſles and plague prevalent in the ſame year—an evidence that on the Barbary coaſt, as well as in Europe and America, theſe epidemics are allied.</p>
                  <p>By this account alſo it appears that in 1789 a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons died by the <hi>aſthma.</hi> It is not probable this was epidemic, and I ſuſpect by this name was intended catarrh or influenza. As this diſeaſe was then epidemic in the United States, it would be gratifying to know whether the ſame epidemic prevailed on the African coaſt, at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable that in the ſpring of 1793, when the ſcarla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina anginoſa had firſt commenced its progreſs in America, it began alſo in England. It appeared firſt in the villages about London, and afterwards deſcended into the city. Med. Mem. vol. 4. It continued to prevail for ſeveral years, with different degrees of violence, at different times. See the Monthly Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azines.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1793-4 was milder than uſual in America. The thermometer in New-York, in a northern expoſure, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no lower than 13 deg. above 0, and but twice to that degree.</p>
                  <p>On the 17th of May was a ſingularly ſevere froſt in the northern ſtates of America, which deſtroyed garden vegetables and the leaves of trees. The wheat, oats and flax in many places turned yellow, and fruit was deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="unknown:036687_0306_100AA2EFB244E968"/>This froſt was preceded by a few remarkable hot days, ſuch as we uſually have in June; and ſpeedily followed by a long ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of rains, with eaſterly winds.</p>
                  <p>This froſt has been ſuppoſed to kill the canker-worms, which had ravaged the orchards, for ſome years preceding. Another opinion is, that a hard froſt in April, deſtroyed them, juſt after they were hatched. A third opinion is, that they had run thro their period of exiſtence, and periſhed in a natural way. In confirmation of which opinion, it is ſaid they were evidently declining in the preceding year. There is probably truth in both the latter opinions.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1794 was, on the whole, not intemperate. We had hot weather, but frequently was the earth refreſhed by ſhowers, and cool weſterly winds. The whooping cough pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in New-York.</p>
                  <p>The ſcarlet fever, in the courſe of this year, ſpread over Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut. Its effects are very apparent in the bills of mortality.</p>
                  <p>It appeared in 1795 in Boſton, in the ſpring or early in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and continued to prevail in Maſſachuſetts and New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire in 1796. Its progreſs from New-York to Maine, about 300 miles or perhaps 400, was run in about four years. It trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled therefore about 100 miles in a year. Such alſo was the fact in the preceding period; as well as in 1735. It ſhould be obſerved alſo that its direction, in the two laſt epidemic periods, has been oppoſite to that of the diſeaſe of 1735. The latter began in New-Hampſhire and marched to the weſtward; the former began in the middle ſtates, and advanced to the eaſtward.</p>
                  <p>On the 10th of June 1794, the bilious plague made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in New-Haven, a ſeaport in Connecticut. The perſon firſt ſeized with the diſeaſe was, the wife of Iſaac Gorham, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the wharf, and the nature of her complaint was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, nor ſuſpected, till near the time of her death, on the 15th.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner was it known that a peſtilential fever was in the city, than the inhabitants took the alarm, and directed an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination to be made into the cauſes. On enquiry, the following appeared to be the ſources of the diſeaſe, or were reported to be the probable cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="303" facs="unknown:036687_0307_100AA32A8D3BAA30"/>In the beginning, of June, Capt. Truman arrived from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinico, in a ſloop, which was hauled up by the ſtore of Mr. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah Auſtin, a few rods from the houſe of Mr. Gorham. This ſloop was <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> to be infected with the peſtilential fever of the Weſt-Indies. From this ſloop was landed a cheſt of clothes, which had belonged to a ſeaman who died with the fever in Martinico; which cheſt was opened and the contents inventoried by Mr. Auſtin, in his ſtore, in preſence of Capt. Truman, of Henry Hubbard, a clerk in the ſtore, and of Polly Gorham, a niece of Iſaac Gorham. Mr. Auſtin and his clerk were ſeized, a few days after the opening of this cheſt, (but how many days is not ſtated) and died about the 20th of June, Polly Gorham was ſeized on the 12th and died on the 17th of June.</p>
                  <p>Theſe circumſtances appeared to the people at that time, to be clear and deciſive evidence of the importation of the fomites of the diſeaſe; and eſpecially the fact, that Mr. Auſtin and his clerk were attacked with the ſymptoms, nearly at the ſame time. This acquieſcence in an opinion ſo important to ſociety and truth, renders it neceſſary to ſtate the reſult of more careful enquiries.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, the opinion that the ſloop could communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the infection, is unfounded; for it does not appear that any perſon, ill with yellow fever, had been on board—there cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had not been any ſick on board, after her leaving Martin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ico. The ſloop was taken by the Britiſh troops, when they took that iſland, and lay in port ſome weeks, unoccupied; until Capt. Truman had an opportunity to purchaſe her. In the mean time, ſome of the crew, to keep themſelves employed and procure bread, went in the buſineſs of <hi>droging;</hi> that is, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting goods from place to place. One of them died with the fever, but on ſhore, and he had not been on board of the ſloop, after his illneſs. On the paſſage home, the ſeamen were all in good health. Then, is therefore not the leaſt ground to ſuppoſe the ſloop contained any infection, and no part of her cargo was ſuppoſed to be in a bad ſtate. The external parts of a veſſel or houſe cannot retain or communicate infection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. As to the cheſt of clothes, it is probable it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained no infection from diſeaſed perſons; for by the affidavit of
<pb n="404" facs="unknown:036687_0308_100A89C2964A0248"/>
Capt. Truman, taken before Alderman Furman of New-York, at the requeſt of Dr. Baily, the Health Officer of that port, which affidavit I have conſulted, it appears that the clothing, worn by the ſeaman who owned the cheſt and died at Martinico, was all wrapped in his blanket with his body and buried. As Capt. Truman is a man of good character and has made his affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit, four years ſince the diſeaſe at New-Haven, when all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of injury from declaring the truth, have ſubſided, there ſeems to be no reaſon to queſtion the fact.</p>
                  <p>But as men, who have not attended to the great operations of nature in producing epidemic diſeaſes, naturally look for the cauſes among viſible and tangible ſubſtances, they ſtill found a reſource in a Britiſh regimental coat, which was in the cheſt, and which, it was <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> might have belonged to a ſoldier who <hi>might have died</hi> of the yellow fever. In conſequence of theſe ſuſpicions, the contents of the cheſt were all burnt.</p>
                  <p>On examination it appears that the coat was new—and the mate of the ſloop has ſworn that he ſaw the coat plundered by the ſeaman from a bale of goods, and he believes it had never been worn. It was taken by the ſeaman in the buſineſs of drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from among the packages of clothing ſent by the Britiſh government for the uſe of the troops. But had we no ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, common ſenſe might inform us, that a man, <hi>laboring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a fever in the ſultry climate of the Weſt-Indies,</hi> would not wear his regimental.</p>

If Mr. Auſtin and his clerk received the ſeeds of diſeaſe from the clothing in the cheſt, as it is poſſible they did, the ſources of the diſeaſe muſt have been the fetid effluvia or dirty clothes, which had been kept a long time, cloſe packed in a cheſt, in a ſultry climate. It is not neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the clothes to have been worn by a diſeaſed perſon.

For whether the trunk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained infected clothes or not, is wholly material; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reference to that point, the evidence that the fever in New-Haven did not ſpring from any imported ſource, is complete.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Auſtin went on buſineſs to New-York, was ſeized with fever and died. His body was conveyed in a ſloop to New-Haven, and buried. It is an agreed point, that no friend, nurſe or other perſon took the fever from him.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hubbard went on buſineſs to Derby, ten miles diſtant, was taken ill and died. His body was carried to New-Haven, and buried. It is agreed that no perſon took the diſeaſe from him.</p>
                  <p>It is not known that Polly Gorham was ever near the trunk of clothing—the report of her being preſent reſts on the ſtory of a child. But if ſhe was, it makes no difference, for no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who attended her was affected, except her mother, who had a ſlight fever. She lived and was ill, a mile from the wharf, and no perſon in that neighborhood was afterwards affected. In ſhort, it is not pretended that the infection proceeded from either of theſe perſons—the <hi>only perſons</hi> who could poſſibly have taken the diſeaſe from the trunk of clothing.</p>
                  <p>It is admitted on all hands that the infection muſt have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the houſe of Iſaac Gorham. Now it happens that Mrs. Gorham who was <hi>firſt ſeized and five days before Mr. Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin and his clerk,</hi> had never been near the trunk of clothing, nor was an article of clothing from the ſloop carried into the houſe. For this aſſertion, I have the authority of Mr. Gorham himſelf, who is admitted to be a man of veracity.</p>
                  <p>Had the origin and phenomena of epidemic diſeaſes ever been underſtood, the people of New-Haven would have foreſeen, with
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:036687_0310_100AA2F25ED07938"/>
a good degree of certainty, that they could not eſcape peſtilence. This will appear from the following facts.</p>
                  <p>In the winter and ſpring of 1794, the ſcarlatina anginoſa pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed generally in New-Haven and the neighboring towns; manifeſting a highly peſtilential condition of the elements. One caſe of bilious fever, attended with a vomiting of black matter, occurred as early as the laſt week in March.</p>
                  <p>For many months preceding the invaſion of the fever, the oyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, on the coaſt of Connecticut, were in a very ſickly ſtate. Many people can teſtify to the truth of this fact; but I have an account of it recorded at the time by the late Preſident Stiles. In a letter to his ſon-in-law, the Rev. Mr. Holmes, of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge in Maſſachuſetts, dated Sept. 25, 1794, be writes, that for twelve months paſt he had eaten very few oyſters, as they were diſeaſed, poor and dropſical. He remarked this of the oyſters from New-York to Boſton. Thoſe caught on the ſhores of Branford, Killingworth, and at Blue-Point on the ſouth ſide of Long-Iſland, were intolerable. At the date of the letter they were recovering and becoming more palatable. This is a ſtriking proof of the derangement of the elements.</p>
                  <p>Further evidence of this fact was furniſhed by the multitudes of caterpillars which overran the city of New-Haven, in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of 1794.<note n="*" place="bottom">Some perſons ſay, this was in 1773, but it is not material.</note> In ſuch numbers were theſe inſects, that they almoſt covered the trees, fences, and houſes to the tops of chimneys. The preceding hiſtory furniſhes many inſtances of this phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, preceding and accompanying peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>Had theſe phenomena been underſtood, the people of New-Haven would have had no occaſion to appoint a committee to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin into the cauſes of the fever. It was hardly poſſible, in the nature of things, that the human race ſhould eſcape the calamity of epidemic diſeaſes, under the operation of cauſe ſo general and powerful.</p>
                  <p>But theſe were not all. Mr. Gorham, whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ily firſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by the fever, had, in the month preceding the invaſion, cleaned a great number of ſhad, upon the wharf by his door,
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:036687_0311_100AA33066B2C4D0"/>
and thrown the garbage, to the amount of a car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> load perhaps, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dock.</p>
                  <p>The alternate waſhing of the tide, and action of a hot ſun, had rendered the putrefaction of this maſs of filth extremely ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid; and there being no current to remove it, the ſtench be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intolerable. On the other ſide of the wharf, a few rods diſtant, a boat load of clams had been depoſited an the mud, that the water, during the ſlux of the tide, might preſerve them; but a great part of them were ſoon ſpoiled, and added to the fetor of the atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>To complete the liſt of nuiſances, ſome barrels of damaged pickled cod-fiſh had been thrown from a ſtore into the dock, and the whole was left vncovered during the receſs of the tide. So noiſome was the air of the place, for ſometime before the fever appeared, that the proprietor of the wharf deſiſted from his uſual morning viſits before breakfaſt. For all theſe facts I have the declarations of the perſons concerned and eye witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>The putrefaction of fleſh, from thirty years obſervations, I can teſtify, will not always produce diſeaſe. But in a peſtilential ſtate of air, the diſſolution of fleſh is unuſually rapid, and the acid evolved, peculiarly noxious. In ſuch circumſtances, putreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſubſtances of all kinds appear to be powerful auxiliary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of diſeaſe. The condition of the elements accelerates putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and that putrefaction in turn increaſes the deleterious quality of the air.<note n="*" place="bottom">I may add to theſe cauſes of the fever, the water of the well uſed by the people living on the wharf, which happened at that time to be covered over with dead rats in a ſtate of putrefaction. This was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverd by the offenſiveneſs of the water.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under the operation of ſo many cauſes of diſeaſe, inſtead of being ſurpriſed at the appearance of a peſtilential fever, we are rather to wonder that its ravages were not more extenſive.</p>
                  <p>That the putrefaction of the fiſh was an exciting cauſe of the fever in New-Haven, is probable from the early appearance of it in ſummer. The firſt caſes occurred about the 10th of June, which is earlier than the epidemic peſtilence of America uſually occurs; and which indicates the exiſtence of ſtrong local cauſes. What further confirms this opinion, is, that after a few weeks
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:036687_0312_100AA2F68B5A5F40"/>
the diſtemper was nearly or wholly extinct. In July died only three perſons, and for about two weeks, no new caſe occurred. But in Auguſt, the uſual time of the appearance of this diſeaſe in this part of America, it broke out with freſh violence. It is probable therefore that the <hi>morbid local</hi> cauſes induced the fever in one ſmall ſpot, before the proper ſeaſon for it to prevail. Theſe cauſes being gradually extinguiſhed by the tides and a hot ſun, the diſeaſe ſubſided, until the uſual ſeaſon for ſuch fevers. The ſame took place in New-York in 1795—in 1796—and 1798.</p>
                  <p>That the plague in New-Haven was the effect of a condition of the elements united with local cauſes, is proved by ſubſequent events. In the following year, a malignant dyſentery originated and prevailed in New-Haven, deſtroying more lives than the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious plague of 1794. This diſeaſe is acknowledged by able phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians to be of the ſame ſpecies as the yellow fever. See Lind on that point, and Ruſh's Works vol. 5. 5, where it is ſtated, on the authority of Dr. Woodhouſe, that ſeveral perſons took the yellow fever from ſoldiers, laboring under the dyſentery. It is well known alſo that an epidemic yellow fever has been converted, by a ſudden change of weather, into an epidemic dyſentery, and <hi>vice verſa;</hi> as at Baltimore in 1797. It is alſo true that the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever in autumn paſſes off in dyſentery, as in New-London in 1798. The ſame is at times true of the plague in Aſia.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe in 1795, as well as a ſimilar dyſentery in Derby in 1794, demonſtrated the deleterious condition of the elements in that region or vicinity.</p>
                  <p>If further evidence was neceſſary, we have it in the bad ſtate of the water in ſome of the wells in New-Haven, during the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of theſe diſeaſes, in which, one of the phyſicians of the city has informed me, were animalcules viſible to the naked eye. This fact correſponds with what occured in Athens, during the plague, where the badneſs of the water, it is ſuppoſed, led the people to aſcribe the diſeaſe to the poiſoning of the wells by the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians. A ſimilar fact probably led the Germans, in 1349, to ſuſpect the Jews had poiſoned the wells, and on ſuſpicion alone to maſſacre them without mercy. This ſtate of the water, and the ſickneſs of the oyſters alone decide the point, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſources of the epidemics of 1794 and 5, were in the elements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="309" facs="unknown:036687_0313_100AA331EDD00ED0"/>It has been aſſerted that no perſon in New-Haven was affected by the fever, without intercourſe with the ſick or with infected clothing. On careful enquiry, I find this is not true. Several perſons were affected who were not in the rooms, nor even in the houſes of the ſick, and who could not be expoſed, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways than by paſſing along the ſtreets. But ſuch perſons could not take the fever from the effluvia of the diſeaſed. Men who ſuppoſe this, are unacquainted with the powers of infection. Dr. Chiſholm ſtates expreſsly that the infection of that diſeaſe in Grenada never exceeded <hi>ten feet;</hi> that it was eaſy to avoid it, and many who lived in the houſes of the diſeaſed, eſcaped. Med. Repoſ. vol. 2. 288. Dr. Lind, the ableſt writer on the ſubject, who ſpent his whole life in jails and hoſpitals, has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the ſame doctrin. A great number of ſick in a narrow cloſe built ſtreet, may render the air of it infectious, but a few diſeaſed perſons in the wide ſtreets of New-Haven could not produce this effect. In general however the diſeaſe in this place was propagated by infection; the pollution of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere being confined to a ſmall diſtrict on and near the wharf, on low ground, to the leeward of the putrid ſubſtances before mentioned, and near the creek.</p>
                  <p>But there is one fact that will decide the queſtion relative to the origin of the peſtilential fever in New-Haven, and every other place. It is ſtated by the phyſicians that all other diſeaſes yielded to this fever. After it appeared in June, the ſcarlatina ſubſided, and "in September, when the fever was moſt preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, the inhabitants in general were almoſt entirely free from every other complaint."</p>
                  <bibl>See Dr. Monſon's account of the fever, in my Collection, p. 178.</bibl>
                  <p>Here we have an infallible criterion by which to determin whether a diſeaſe is an epidemic of the place, or introduced and propagated ſolely by infection. A diſeaſe of mere infection can never extinguiſh other diſeaſes of the place. The ſmall-pox introduced by <hi>variolous matter,</hi> and communicated to every fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily would not abſorb a dyſentery or ſcarlet fever prevailing in the ſame place; every hoſpital will demonſtrate this principle. A diſeaſe of mere infection would not affect another diſeaſe even
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:036687_0314_100AA2F8145D6CB8"/>
in the next houſe. Every diſeaſe that extinguiſhes another diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe current in a town, is an epidemic originating in that place. It not only proves that the atmoſphere will produce that diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but it proves that it will produce no other. On this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I will reſt the queſtion, as it regards not only the fever in New-Haven, but every peſtilence that ever exiſted.</p>
                  <p>The ſummer of 1794 was, in moſt places, leſs ſickly than in 1793 and 1795; yet the ſcarlatina extended its ravages over Connecticut, and Philadelphia and New-York experienced the predominant epidemic conſtitution. In Philadelphia died from 70 to 100 perſons of the bilious plague; in New-York twenty or thirty caſes of the ſame diſeaſe indicated the ſame condition of the atmoſphere. It was the general opinion in New-York, that the city was remarkably healthy; but this opinion, ſo flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to the people, was a fallacy. The bills of mortality were higher than in healthy years, and this augmented mortality was a prelude to the epidemic of the ſucceeding year.</p>
                  <p>On the 15th of June was a great eruption of Veſuvius, nearly equal to that of 1779. The lava ran down the mountain on the weſt and extended to the ſea, overwhelming the town of Tome del Greco.</p>
                  <bibl>See Univerſal Mag. for Aug. 1795.</bibl>
                  <p>In this year the bilious peſtilence prevailed in Baltimore. No ſuggeſtion has been made that it was imported, and the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and inhabitants ſeem to admit the diſeaſe to have been on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a more malignant form of the ordinary autumnal remittent.</p>
                  <p>In the ſucceeding winter, the epidemic of the ſummer and autumn changed, in Philadelphia, into the form of catarrh or pleuriſy, and in many caſes, was attended with delirium and mania. See Ruſh on this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Peſtilential epidemics, or rather the ſtate of the atmoſphere which produces them, uſually affects the brain, in a moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degree. This is obvious from the vertigo, ſo frequent during ſickly periods; pains in the head, dizzineſs and nervous debility often complained of by ſtudious men. In ſome periods, this affection of the brain has appeared in epidemic madneſs. See the years 1355; 1373 and 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="311" facs="unknown:036687_0315_100AA333774EB100"/>A few caſes of a diſorder of this ſpecies appeared in New-Haven and its vicinity in the winter after the peſtilence. The patient was ſeized with a violent pain in the head, between the Os frontis and the Coronal Sutures, which was periodical, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing about 11 o'clock A. M. and increaſing till 2 P. M. In ſome caſes, the paroxiſm was accompanied with delirium; but the pain was limited to the head, and unattended with fever. Bleeding, purging and opium produced no alleviation; but a bliſter on the forehead or temple, ſoon relieved the patient, and effected a cure. This account is taken from Dr. Hotchkiſs, the attending phyſician.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1794-5 was very cold in Europe, and in January 1795, the French troops marched into Amſterdam, over the rivers and canals, on the ice. This ſeverity was to be expected from the great eruption of Veſuvius in the preceding ſummer.</p>
                  <p>The catarrh was epidemic in January and February, in the Britiſh channel fleet. In one ſhip it aſſumed the ſymptoms of a pure typhus.</p>
                  <bibl>Trotter's Med. Naut. p. 366.</bibl>
                  <p>In America, the ſame winter was milder than uſual. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons walked on the battery at New-York, for pleaſure, on Chriſtmas day, with no covering but their ordinary autumnal clothes; and veſſels ſailed up the Hudſon and Connecticut till January. In the latter part of the winter, we had ſome cold weather, and a cool late ſpring.</p>
                  <p>About the 20th of July, began a ſeries of hot, damp, rainy weather, with light ſoutherly winds; a ſeaſon anſwering to the deſcription which Hippocrates has given of a peſtilential conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Heavy rains were followed by a humid, cloſe, ſultry air; no thunder and lightning; no north-weſterly winds to cool and refreſh the fainting bodies of men. For many weeks the atmoſphere was ſo loaded with vapor, that no electricity could be excited with the beſt inſtruments. Fruit periſhed on the trees and fell half rotten and covered with mold. Sound potatoes from the market periſhed in my cellar in thirty-ſix hours. Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages rotted off, between the head and the ſtalk, as they ſtood
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:036687_0316_100AA2F99CE0EDD8"/>
in gardens. The moiſture penetrated into the inmoſt receſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of deſks and bureaus, covering books, papers and clothes with mold, under two locks. The walls of houſes, and the paper of inner apartments became white with mold and required ſcraping. This ſtate of the air produced alſo muſketoes without number; while flies diſappeared. It is obſervable that theſe two kinds of inſects thrive in different conditions of the air— flies in a hot, dry air; muſketoes, in a hot, moiſt air.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary here to correct a miſtake of Dr. Currie on bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious fevers, page 12, where he mentions the years 1795 and 7 as "wetter and cooler than many preceding ſeaſons." The truth is, the latter part of the ſummer of 1795, was on an average three degrees by Farenheit, warmer than the weather had been in the ten preceding years. See a letter from Profeſſor Kemp in Dr. Bailey on yellow fever, p. 54. In the courſe of my life, I never experienced a ſtate of air ſo debilitating and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to animal ſpirits, as the month of Auguſt 1795. The effects of it are very viſible in the bill of mortality for that year in Philadelphia, which contains double the uſual number of deaths.</p>
                  <p>In July of this year appeared the bilious plague in New-York. The firſt caſe that excited public attention was that of Dr. Treat, the Health Officer of the port, who fell a victim, on the 29th of the month. His diſeaſe has been aſcribed by ſome perſons, to infection taken on board a veſſel from the Weſt-Indies, the brig Zepher in which a perſon died, whom Dr. Treat aſſiſted in burying. But it is not probable, that this was a juſt opinion; as many other perſons viſited the ſame veſſel, and the wardens of the port were on board, while a part of her cargo, ſome damaged coffee, was thrown into the ſtream, without the leaſt inconvenience to their health. The plethoric habit of Dr. Treat, and his great fatigue in an open boat and in a burning ſun, are ſufficient to account for his diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>But admitting him to have taken his diſeaſe from the fomes of a ſick or dead perſon, or from the foulneſs of the brig, the fact does not in the leaſt aid the advocates of infection, for no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nurſe, attendant or viſitor, received the diſtemper from him,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:036687_0317_100AA3360E1F72B0"/>
nor did the diſeaſe prevail, in the ſtreet where he died, during the ſubſequent ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>It was ſaid that three or four ſeamen, belonging to the ſhip William, were ſeized with the diſtemper in conſequence of viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the brig Zepher. But on enquiry, it was found, that theſe men only came along ſide of the brig and purchaſed ſome fruit. To ſuppoſe theſe men ſhould all take a diſeaſe from the brig, when two or three wardens of the port, who were ſome hours on board, while a damaged cargo was diſcharged, eſcaped without the leaſt affection, is ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>But what cuts ſhort all controverſy on this ſubject, is, that fourteen days at leaſt before the death of Dr. Treat, a man in the hoſpital died of a ſimilar fever; and the late Dr. Pitt Smith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me in the autumn of 1795, that he viſited another patient a blackſmith, with a ſimilar diſeaſe, early in July. In fact then, the diſeaſe was in New-York before the arrival of the ſuppoſed infected veſſels; and the caſes which occurred early in July, were <hi>precurſors</hi> of the epidemic which was to follow.</p>
                  <p>It muſt alſo be obſerved that the diſeaſe in New-York never ſpread over the whole city. It ran along the low ſtreets on the Eaſt river, in what was formerly the ſwamp and in the narrow alleys. The high grounds in the center of the city, and the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern ſide of the iſland, were healthy as uſual; and the diſeaſe, when carried from the infected ſtreets, upon the elevated parts of the city, exhibited no contagion, but diſappeared.—A ſmall part only of the citizens fled; moſt of them remained, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued their occupations, in the greateſt part of the city, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſafety. The deaths were about ſeven hundred and thirty; among which at leaſt five hundred were foreigners, moſt of whom had recently arrived from Scotland and Ireland.<note n="*" place="bottom">Four hundred and ſixty two belonged to the Catholic Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Rev. Mr. O'Brien, moſt of whom had been ſo ſhort a time in the country, that he did not know them.</note> The mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in New-York was moſtly owing to this influx of foreigners, not ſeaſoned to our climate.</p>
                  <p>This fever in New-York was preceded in ſpring by epidemic meaſles, which diſappeared totally during the three months, when
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:036687_0318_100AA2FC1B6B1AA0"/>
the fever was the ruling diſeaſe, and re-appeared in November— a deciſive evidence that the fever was produced and controlled by the ſame cauſe, as the meaſles.</p>
                  <p>In this year alſo appeared the ſame diſeaſe at a landing, called Mill-river four miles from Fairfield, in Connecticut, and about ſixty miles from New-York—a ſmall village, near the water. It was reported that this diſtemper was propagated at Mill-river, by infected perſons from New-York. I have taken pains to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire carefully of both the attending phyſicians and the clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who viſited the ſick, who all agree, that one man from New-York had died of the fever in the village, that ſummer, and he was dead, <hi>three weeks</hi> before, Mr. Tharp, the firſt man ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was taken ill.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe affected others of his family, but ſpread no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the gentlemen above-mentioned do not believe it to have been derived from imported infection.</p>
                  <p>The bilious remittent fever, is annually the diſeaſe of autumn in ſome parts of the ſouthern ſtates; and ſtrangers, viſiting that country from the Delaware to Florida, in the hot ſeaſon run the hazard of a fever. Drs. Taylor and Hansford, two old practitioners in Norfolk, Virginia, ſpeaking of the yellow fever of 1795, ſay, "The ſame fever, with all its malignant and uncontrollable ſymptoms, occurs every year, in ſcattered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and about the ſame ſeaſon."</p>
                  <bibl>See my Collection on Bilious Fevers, p. 151.</bibl>
                  <p>But during peſtilential periods, this diſeaſe in that unhealthy country, takes a wider ſpread, and becomes infectious.</p>
                  <p>In 1795 this was the caſe at Norfolk—a town that is ſituated on low flat land, a few feet only above high-water, and ſubject to autumnal fevers. The diſeaſe prevailed moſt in the narrow ſtreets and poor ſmall houſes, and was moſt fatal to ſtrangers.</p>
                  <p>Two remarkable facts occurred there and are related in the account laſt cited, to prove that the diſeaſe was occaſioned ſolely by a general ſtate of the atmoſphere in and about the town, without a dependence on infection. The firſt is, that traders who viſited the port, altho they were not known to have had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the ſick, took the diſeaſe and died on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the country. But a more remarkable fact is, that the
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:036687_0319_100AA3385E2B5F98"/>
ſeamen of a ſhip from Liverpool, which did not approach near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than five miles diſtance from the town, and which had no communication with the ſhore, except by means of the health-boat, were almoſt all attacked with the diſeaſe, in ten days after their arrival. This was late in the ſeaſon, and when the diſeaſe had nearly diſappeared in town.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1794 ſeveral caſes of the ſame diſeaſe had occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Norfolk. In 1797 the diſeaſe was again frequent. In 1795 and 7, the diſeaſe was ſuppoſed to have been augmented by the great rains and floods which had preceded, and which had brought down the river and ſpread on the ſhores, large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of vegetable ſubſtances.</p>
                  <p>The extreme unhealthineſs of the ſummer of 1795, was man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſted by unuſual mortality in various other parts of the country. On the level plains of Ducheſs county in New-York ſtate, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed a mortal dyſentery and typhus fever. At Coxſakie on the weſt of the Hudſon, raged ſimilar diſeaſes with fatal effects. In ſome weſtern parts of the ſtate, near the marſhes which border the waters of the country, a malignant bilious fever was more terribly fatal, than the fever in New-York.</p>
                  <p>In Sheffield, a weſtern townſhip of Maſſachuſetts, near two large ponds which form marſhy grounds, bilious fevers, which had not been known there for many years, before, prevailed and in ſome caſes were mortal.</p>
                  <bibl>See Dr. Buel's account of theſe diſeaſes, in my Collection, p. 53.</bibl>
                  <p>In that town, the progreſſiveneſs of the morbid principle of this peſtilential period, was clearly diſcoverable. Many caſes of intermittents occurred in 1793; and a few inſtances of bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious remittents. This was during the plague in Philadelphia. In 1794, early in ſpring, inflammatory diſeaſes of the pneumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic kind, were unuſually frequent. Theſe were ſucceeded by intermittents, which were more frequent than in the preceding year. In July, the bilious remittent appeared, and 80 inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants out of 150, who lived within a mile and a half of the ſouth pond, were affected. In 1795, of 200 inhabitants within three fourths of a mile diſtant from the north pond, 150 were affected with the ſame diſeaſe—but few died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="316" facs="unknown:036687_0320_100AA2FE5477A3A8"/>In 1796, the dyſentery, which had not appeared in many preceding years, began its attacks on children, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter adults were taken either with the ſame diſeaſe or with the bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious remittent. Of one hundred families living within a mile and a half of one of the ponds, not ten eſcaped ſickneſs—more than half of the inhabitants were, in the courſe of the ſeaſon, attacked with one or other of the abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> mentioned diſeaſes. Of 150 perſons who lived neareſt to the pond, not ten eſcaped. The deaths by theſe diſeaſes were forty-four. Here then was a regular increaſe of malignancy in the autumnal diſeaſes, from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents, to the worſt form of dyſentery and bilious remittent.</p>

                  <p>In the preceding period, great mortality prevailed among the geeſe in ſome parts of our country; and in the year 1796, a ſimilar mortality among other fowls. I have not been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a particular deſcription of the ſymptoms, but it was obſerved the tranſition from apparent health to death, was very rapid.</p>
                  <p>In 1796 the meaſles which commenced in New-York in 1795 was epidemic in Connecticut; and unuſually prevalent in London.</p>
                  <p>In 1796 alſo the bilious plague again appeared in New-York, but in a different quarter of the city from that which was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally affected, the year preceding. In 1795, it began and was moſt general in the north-eaſtern part—in 1796, in the ſouth-weſtern part, near the battery; and in both ſummers, its ſeat was along the wharves on the Eaſt river, and in the adjoining ſtreets and alleys. All this part of the city is a level, formed by extending the land and wharves into the Eaſt river. The land is of courſe looſe and porous, admitting, in many places, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſea into the cellars of the houſes; ſome of which are penetrated, on every flux of the tide. Theſe artificial ſtreets, Front and Water ſtreets, are not eaſily waſhed clean, on account of their level poſition, and they receive the filth waſhed from the higher grounds of the city. To theſe ſtreets, and ſimilar ones in the ſwamp on the north-eaſt, was the malignant diſtemper principally limited.</p>
                  <p>In 1796 a new wharf below Exchange ſlip, which had been timbered the preceding autumn, and left unfilled, had become a
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:036687_0321_100AA33B837C49C8"/>
reſervoir for all kinds of putrid, filthy ſubſtances, and was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a powerful cauſe of diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the quarter in which the diſeaſe raged this year, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly covered with old wooden houſes, and many of them, built before the raiſing and paving of the ſtreet, have their lower floors two or three feet below the ſurface of the pavements. In this diſtrict appeared the yellow fever in June; but a ſeries of rainy weather and cool weſterly winds, ſuſpended its action, in the beginning of July. Succeeding hot weather renewed it, and in the limits above deſcribed, extending about forty or fifty rods, about ſeventy perſons fell victims. The other parts of the city remained in the uſual autumnal ſtate of health, with only a few ſcattering caſes of the plague.</p>
                  <p>At Wilmington, North-Carolina, prevailed a ſimilar diſeaſe. It was preceded by the dyſentery, in July, after a very wet ſpring. When the bilious fever commenced in Auguſt, the dyſentery declined, and thoſe who had been affected with it eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the fever. About one hundred and fifty deaths, by theſe two forms of diſeaſe, occurred in 130 families. Different opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions were entertained about the origin of the fever; but the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician who gives this account has no doubts of its domeſtic origin. He informs us further that a few caſes, in that town, occur annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, which aſſume all the ſymptoms of a violent yellow fever.</p>

                  <p>In this year, the diſeaſe occaſioned a conſiderable mortality in Charleſton, South-Carolina, and in Newburyport, in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts. It appeared in Boſton alſo, but was not general nor ſevere.</p>
                  <p>In Charleſton, it ſucceeded one of the moſt deſtructive fires, ever known in that city; and was in part aſcribed to the ſtagnant water which accumulated in the open cellars.</p>
                  <p>In Newburyport, there was no plauſible pretext for aſcribing the diſeaſe to imported infection; and the general belief was, that the immediate exciting cauſe, was, the remains of large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fiſh which had been left to corrupt on the wharf, near which the diſtemper originated, and which occaſioned an intolerable ſtench. But in that town, a previous increaſe of mortality indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated a ſickly ſtate of the elements; as in all other places, where
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:036687_0322_100AA30199DBBC58"/>
the peſtilence has made its appearance. In none of the northern ſtates, which are uſually healthy, has the bilious plague occurred without other diſeaſes for precurſors.—The diſeaſe in Newbury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port was confined to a low ſtreet or two, and when carried upon the high grounds, it exhibited little or no infection, but diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with the death or recovery of the patient.</p>

                  <p>In Boſton, the diſeaſe ſpread only in a ſmall part of the town, adjoining the water. The phyſicians were unanimouſly of opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that it was not occaſioned by any fomites from infected arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles imported, but generated in the town.</p>

                  <p>The peſtilential ſtate of the elements was ſtrongly marked, this year, by the poorneſs of the ſhad brought to market in New-York. Theſe were all thin, lean and ſmall; and for this reaſon, I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed none for my own uſe, during the ſeaſon. Other perſons obſerved the fact; and I am ſince informed that ſuch of thoſe fiſh as were pickled, periſhed in defiance of all human care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them. The ſame ſtate of the ſhad was obſerved in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut.</p>
                  <p>Some caſes of yellow fever occurred in Philadelphia in 1796; catarrh was frequent in the winter, followed by meaſles of a moſt inflammatory nature. A remarkable halo appeared on the 25th of July.</p>
                  <bibl>Ruſh, vol. 5. 9.</bibl>
                  <p>It has been already obſerved that the winter of 1795, was remarkably ſevere in Europe. In America the ſame winter was as mild as uſual. But in the ſummer and autumn of 1796, the northern ſtates experienced a moſt ſevere drouth.</p>
                  <p>The following winter was very ſevere; the cold exceeding what is uſual, and being of long duration. The ſummer of 1797 was cool and wet. The winter of 1797-8 was ſevere— and the cold of very long duration. It commenced early in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember and continued till March. The Hudſon and Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut were cloſed in November; a very rare occurrence. For ſeveral weeks in November and December, the wind, without much ſnow on the earth along the Atlantic coaſt, was from the north-weſt and intenſely dry and cold.</p>

                     <pb n="319" facs="unknown:036687_0323_100AA33DE08ECEF0"/>In Auguſt 1797 appeared a comet, which, according to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of aſtronomers, paſſed near the earth, altho it was of ſmall apparent magnitude, and ſeen by few people.</p>
                  <p>The influence of this ſpecies of bodies in occaſioning great tides, and violent ſtorms, has been already mentioned, and of that influence, in the preſent inſtance, I was a witneſs. In 1797 my reſidence was, as it had been the preceding year, on a height of York Iſland near Corlaer's Hook to the northward of which is a flat, which is never covered with water by a common tide, but is overſpread by ſpring tides, or any unuſual ſwell in conſequence of eaſterly winds. I obſerved, as early as the laſt week in May, high tides were unuſually frequent and the ſwell extraordinary. In the city of New-York, the ſame fact was obſervable; and the inhabitants about Beekman ſlip will recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect how often the wharves and ſtreet were covered with water. Theſe tides were not to be accounted for, on any known prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of lunar influence, and I frequently mentioned the phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon to my friends, but without ſuſpecting the cauſe. The ſame phenomenon was noticed at other places. In Norfolk, the epidemic fever was, in part, aſcribed to unuſual tides; as I was afterwards informed. On the Delaware, the overflowing of the low lands, below Philadelphia, was extraordinary, and ſome phyſicians aſcribe to this cauſe the yellow fever, which ſwept away moſt of a family by the name of Whitall.</p>
                  <p>I was lately mentioning theſe events to a reſpectable gentleman in Stamford,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Hon. John Davenport, now repreſentative in Congreſs.</note> who inſtantly recollected a fact which confirms the foregoing account. He remarked that the common practice in that town, is to mow the ſalt meadows, at the quadratures of the moon, on account of ſmall tides; but in 1797, the calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions failed, and the people were much troubled to collect their hay, on account of high tides—a circumſtance that was very ſurpriſing to him at the time, but he did not advert to the prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cauſe. This was in Auguſt; about the time that the comet was firſt obſerved. The fact then of the influence of comets, in raiſing the waters of the ocean, is well eſtabliſhed; and the
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:036687_0324_100AA30402DAB680"/>
appearance of a comet in autumn explained the phenomena of the tides to my ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The influence of comets in augmenting tempeſts is equally certain and remarkable.</p>
                  <p>On the 19th of Auguſt, a ſtorm and whirlwind in South Pruſſia tore up foreſts carried trees along like ſheaves of wheat, and levelled ſeveral villages.</p>
                  <p>In Rome and Naples happened a moſt extraordinary tempeſt on the 25th of September, ſuch as the oldeſt man could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect. It took up men and carried them ſome diſtance. The aſtronomers were conſulted and they aſcribed it to the approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the comet.</p>
                  <p>A ſtorm of hail in the province of Macconnois, in France, and on the borders of Burgundy, deſtroyed the vines and fruits of the earth in thirty-four villages. In the appropriations made afterwards by the councils of France, four millions were granted to repair the loſſes by hail, inundations and other diſaſters.</p>
                  <p>On the 7th of September, a conſiderable ſhock of earthquake was felt in the Weſtern Pyrenees. On the 28th of the month was a volcanic eruption in Guadaloupe; and many earthquakes occurred during the autumn.</p>
                  <p>In England, the ſummer was ſo rainy and wet, as to injure the corn and threaten the inhabitants with ſcarcity. It would require pages to relate all the accidents by floods in Great-Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain from Auguſt to the cloſe of the year.</p>
                  <p>During the autumnal months, the Black ſea alſo was unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tempeſtuous, and the loſs of ſhipping alarmed Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with apprehenſions of a ſcarcity of proviſions.</p>
                  <p>In February, 1797, South-America was terribly convulſed. Quito and the neighboring provinces ſuffered, by the deſtruction of almoſt every houſe. Mountains were detached from their ſtations and rolled againſt each other, burying villages in ruin. Volcanoes emitted fire, lava, and rivers of water. It is ſaid, that 40,000 inhabitants periſhed.</p>
                  <p>On the 11th of January 1798 a ſhock of earthquake was felt in Lancaſter, Pennſylvania, and the neighboring towns, during which appeared to iſſue from the earth a flame or blaze, like the burning of a chimney.</p>

                  <p>In February 1797 alſo violent earthquakes were experienced on the weſtern coaſt of Sumatra, in the Eaſt-Indies.</p>
                  <p>This year, 1797, was remarkable for other ſingular phenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena in Europe and America.</p>
                  <p>In England a peſtilence among cats ſwept away thoſe animals by thouſands. It ſeems that this diſeaſe began as early as April, and ſucceeded an epidemic catarrh among the human race. The ſame cat-diſtemper was afterwards epidemic in France. A ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety at Montpelier inſtituted an enquiry into this remarkable phenomenon.</p>
                  <p>The cat-diſtemper appeared in Philadelphia, as early as June, and proceeded northward and eaſtward, like the catarrh of 1789. In Auguſt it was very fatal in New-York, and in the courſe of the ſummer and autumn, it ſpread deſtruction among thoſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals over the northern ſtates.</p>
                  <p>In Auguſt, dead fiſh, in great numbers, were ſeen to float down James' river, in Virginia, for many days in ſucceſſion.</p>
                  <p>Canine madneſs, during the ſame year, was unuſually epidemic and attended with fatal effects, of which full accounts may be ſeen in the firſt volume of the Medical Repoſitory.</p>
                  <p>Theſe phenomena indicate an unhealthy ſtate of the elements. But it is a remarkable fact that, in ſome places and ſeaſons, the principal force of the epidemic conſtitution ſeems to be ſpent on <hi>one</hi> ſpecies of animals, while others are exempt. Thus in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the catarrh, which had affected mankind in 1797, ceaſed, before the epidemic ſeized the cats. In America, the northern ſtates, with the exception of a few places, were remarkably healthy, in 1797, while cats died in multitudes. And it is a frequent occurrence in Europe, that while the plague or ſome other malignant diſeaſe is afflicting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="322" facs="unknown:036687_0326_100AA305903381B8"/>In 1797 the bills of mortality in the northern ſtates, which had been ſwelled very high by angina and malignant fevers, fell nearly to the ſtandard of health. There are a few exceptions.</p>
                  <p>The plague appeared in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleſton. In the two latter cities, it is conſidered, as the uſual autumnal fever, with aggravated ſymptoms, from ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or other local or temporary cauſes.</p>
                  <p>In Baltimore, the diſeaſe appeared firſt in the form of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon remittent, but increaſed in malignancy till late in aut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mn and became infectious. The hiſtory of this epidemic is minutely ſtated by the magiſtracy of Baltimore, and is too intereſting to be paſſed with a ſlight notice. The following is a correct ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of the ſtatement made and publiſhed by authority.</p>
                  <p>The commiſſioners ſtate to the mayor of the city;</p>
                  <p>That the firſt appearance of the fever was near the end of June in two young men, Parkin and M'Kenna, who occupied a ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe in South-ſtreet and who died in a few days. The ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe was examined, and was found to contain nothing which could be the ſpecial cauſe of the fever; nor is it ſuggeſted that they were infected from abroad. No perſon received the diſeaſe from them. From this time till the cloſe of Auguſt, Weſt Baltimore remained in a ſtate of unuſual health.</p>
                  <p>In Eaſt Baltimore (Fell's Point) a bilious fever had ſhowed itſelf early in the ſeaſon, and gradually ſpread and grew worſe; but was ſuppoſed to be no other than the common ſickneſs of the ſeaſon. It therefore excited no alarm, till the 26th Auguſt, when a rumor prevailed, that the fever was ſomething <hi>more than common.</hi> The chairman of the board addreſſed a letter to each of the phyſicians in that part of the city, requeſting to be informed whether any caſe of contagious diſeaſe had come under his obſervation.</p>
                  <p>Dr. John Coulter wrote for anſwer that ſince the third week in June, a fever had prevailed and become epidemic, affecting all deſcriptions of people, but moſtly thoſe who labored hard, in the heat of the ſun, intemperate perſons and thoſe who expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves to night air after the labors of the day. The diſeaſe was violent, and unleſs ſpeedily aſſailed with powerful
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:036687_0327_100AA340889288C8"/>
remedies, proved fatal. It had on that day, Auguſt 26th, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come general, and "aſſumed to itſelf the ſole government of the diſeaſes," in that part of the city. "During the wet weather, in the laſt of July and beginning of Auguſt, it yielded, for near two weeks, to the dyſentery," which aftewards gave way to a recurrence of the yellow fever. [The reader is deſired to note that fact.]</p>
                  <p>Dr. Coulter calls the fever an epidemic, in contradiſtinction to imported contagion, and ſays, "it is in the locality of our atmoſphere, the ſource of which I can perceive in every ten ſteps I take in our ſtreets, ponds of ſtagnant water, and ſinks of putrid animal and vegetable matters, exhaling perpetually under a hot ſun the moſt offenſive effluvia." The concluſion he draws is, that the diſeaſe was <hi>not individually infectious.</hi> He then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the uniformity of the ſymptoms, and the correſpondence of the fever with the diſeaſes which have prevailed in that city and in other parts of the continent for a number of years paſt. He enumerates the ſymptoms, which are exactly the ſame, as obſerved in New-Haven, New-York and Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>Doctors Alexander and Jaquitt agree in the facts that the diſeaſe was not imported nor ſpecifically contagious.</p>
                  <p>The board of health then called a meeting of the phyſicians in Weſt Baltimore, and inquired whether any contagious ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had come under their knowledge. They anſwered in the negative. Three of their number, at the requeſt of the meeting, went to Eaſt Baltimore and viſited a number of the ſick. They reported on the 29th of Auguſt, that the diſeaſe was not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, contagious or yellow fever, but the bilious remittent. Their report quieted the alarms of people.</p>
                  <p>On the 2d of September the commiſſioners were alarmed with the opinion of the phyſicians in that part of the city, that the <hi>diſeaſe was ſomething more than common.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Five members of the board, with Dr. Moores, went to the point to examin for themſelves. They found the diſeaſe had ſpread, chiefly among the poor, who lived in confined dwellings —a few perſons were dangerouſly ill; but on the whole, were convinced that the diſeaſe was <hi>not contagious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="324" facs="unknown:036687_0328_100AA308BA425A38"/>The next week, the diſorder aſſumed a more threatening aſpect. The launching of the frigate on the 7th of September, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected many people together, who were expoſed to a hot ſun and fatigue, which ſpread the diſeaſe to Weſt Baltimore. The next day the board of health received regular information that there was <hi>contagion in the diſeaſe.</hi> A meeting of the faculty was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſuitable directions given to check and alleviate the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</p>

                  <p>This plain and candid narrative of facts, which is certified by the preſidents of both branches of the city council and by the mayor, Mr. Calhoun, does great honor to the integrity and dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igence of the commiſſioners; and <hi>if the laws of nature are to be relied on as uniform in their operation, this report alone will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide every diſputed point relative to the origin and phenomena of the yellow fever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is here decided by unequivocal evidence; evidence that precludes the carping of prejudice and the caſuiſtry of intereſt, that the yellow fever and the bilious remittent are the <hi>ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,</hi> differing only in degrees of violence; and it is agreed on all hands that the remitting and intermitting fevers are the ſame diſeaſe, with a ſimilar difference in violence.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe began at Baltimore early in the ſeaſon, in June, and for more than two months, prevailed as a remitting fever of the common kind, without infection, and it is agreed on all hands not to be of imported origin. During a wet ſeaſon, the damp weather caſt the diſeaſe upon the inteſtines, and it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the form of a dyſentery—a moſt important fact, which proves what Dr. Lind has aſſerted, that a dyſentery is a yellow or malignant fever ſeated in the bowels. The wet weather ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the fever reſumed its former appearance, and gradually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, till it exhibited its <hi>worſt forms and became infectious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had the advocates for the domeſtic origin of this fever <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived</hi> and directed a ſeries of facts, to prove their own doctrines,
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:036687_0329_100AA342B5A36E18"/>
it would not have been poſſible to collect ſtronger evidence in their favor, than the report of the board of health in Baltimore.</p>
                  <p>In Philadelphia, the diſeaſe in 1797 appeared, in a few caſes, as early as June—one on the 5th—one on the 9th—one on the 15th and another on the 22d. Theſe caſes, inſtead of being conſidered as proofs of a peſtilential air, and precurſors of more general ſickneſs, are thrown entirely out of the queſtion, by the advocates of imported fomites. The diviſion of opinions, which originated in 1793, relative to the cauſes and origin of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, was revived with aſperity. One party among phyſicians contended that the diſtemper was introduced into the city by the ſhip Arethuſa, which arrived from Jamaica and Havanna, on the 23d of July. Another party believed the ſources of the diſeaſe to have been, noxious exhalations from putrid ſubſtances in the city, with an augment from the foul air of the ſnow Nav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igation from Marſeilles. The evidence to ſupport each of theſe opinions, is publiſhed in the proceedings of the College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and of the Academy of Medicin.</p>
                  <p>The city of Philadelphia was deſerted by a great proportion of its inhabitants, and thus the mortality was limited to about one thouſand victims. It prevailed principally in the ſuburbs.</p>
                  <p>This epidemic was followed as uſual by the influenza.</p>
                  <p>By foreign publications, it appears that the catarrh was epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic in England in the four firſt months of 1797. I have no particulars of the violence or extent of this diſorder; but if it was ſevere and general, no event is more certain than that ſickly ſeaſons will follow.</p>
                  <p>What confirms this opinion, is, that in the following ſummer, the plague raged in Conſtantinople, on the Barbary coaſt, and in Corſica. It appears by an official letter of the French min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter Sotin, that there was a difference of opinion in regard to the epidemic in Corſica—ſome calling it the plague; others, a malignant fever. Thoſe who called it the plague, were prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to account for it, by the tale of a Turkiſh veſſel wrecked upon the iſland, with diſeaſed people on board. But the diſeaſe ſubſided without very extenſive ravages.</p>
                  <p>This malignant fever however occaſioned no ſmall alarm in England. The government ſent orders to ſhips cruiſing in the
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:036687_0330_100AA30D514806C8"/>
Mediterranean to have no communication with veſſels from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica, and a proclamation was iſſued ordering ſtrict quarantine to be performed by all veſſels from Corſica, Minorca, Gibraltar and Spain within the Mediterranean.</p>
                  <p>In 1797 the bilious plague carried off forty-five of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Providence. Of this diſeaſe, I have a minute and judicious account from Mr. Moſes Brown, which is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged.</p>
                  <p>In 1791, the year when the diſeaſe firſt appeared in the Weſt-Indies and New-York, ſeveral perſons died of a ſimilar fever in Providence. Two women died in one family, near the centre of the town, after three days illneſs. They vomitted bilious matter, and were yellow, with livid and purple ſpots. The ſecond, being ſeized two days after the death of the firſt, might have taken the diſeaſe by infection; but no ſuſpicion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted that the firſt had acceſs to any infecting cauſe.</p>
                  <p>On the 14th of Auguſt died another perſon in a different part of the town, and on the 21ſt of September, a fourth, with ſimilar ſymptoms. As no alarm had then been excited by yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, little notice was taken of theſe caſes; but the attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing phyſician, a reſpectable character, who viſited many patients in 1797 and was affected with the diſeaſe himſelf, has ſince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the diſeaſe of 1791 and of 1797 to be the ſame.</p>
                  <p>A caſe very ſimilar to theſe occurred in September 1792; and on the weſt ſide of the river, prevailed a ſingular epidemic, in which perſons became yellow, with black urine, coſtive bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, pains in the right hypochondrium, without fever. Some had petechial ſpots, and one perſon, petechia, vibices and hemhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, yet the diſeaſe was not mortal, nor malignant.</p>
                  <p>In 1793 a perſon from Philadelphia was ill and died of the yellow fever in Providence, but no other was infected.</p>
                  <p>In 1794 ſeveral perſons had the ſame diſeaſe, but they took it probably in Carolina, where they had been on a voyage; the diſeaſe did not ſpread by infection.</p>
                  <p>On the 11th of July 1795, died Capt. J. Gifford, a reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able man, of the ſame diſeaſe. No infection was ſuppoſed in the caſe—he was buried under arms, but no inconvenience was experienced from it, at the time. Yet two years after, viz. in
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:036687_0331_100AA345174D0AC8"/>
1797, his family were affected with the diſorder, at the time when it became epidemic in the neighborhood.</p>
                  <p>Several other caſes occurred, in the ſame year, and one of them exhibited infection.</p>
                  <p>Theſe caſes demonſtrate a peſtilential principle exiſting in that town, in every ſeaſon from 1791 to 1795 incluſive; at the time when other parts of the United States were more ſeverely afflicted. They were the diſtant precurſors of a more general calamity in that town, which did not arrive till 1797.</p>
                  <p>Sporadic caſes of peſtilential fever do not render it <hi>certain</hi> but <hi>probable,</hi> that the diſeaſe will, in a future ſeaſon, become epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic. In 1796 cholera infantum and dyſentery were prevalent.</p>
                  <p>In 1797 the hydrophobia was prevalent in the ſtate of Rhode-Iſland, as well as in other ſtates. One T. Lyon was bitten by a dog, the wound healed, and he was ſeized four months after, and died. The peſtilence among cats prevailed alſo in Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
                  <p>In this year alſo prevailed at Weſtport in the ſame ſtate, and on Nantucket iſland, a very malignant epidemic dyſentery. At Weſtport died 30 patients of 79 who were ſeized. On Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucket the diſeaſe was leſs mortal; about 100 died out of 2000 patients. On examination, it was found that under the houſe of the family firſt ſeized, there were ſome barrels of putrid fiſh, and other nauſeous matter.</p>
                  <p>It was ſuppoſed alſo, that the diſeaſe might have been aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the effluvia of a large pond, at ſome miles diſtance, which had become ſtagnant, filled with graſs, and the ſhores ſtrewed with dead fiſh. A number of men, on this diſcovery, opened a trench to drain off the water, and let in the tides, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, it was ſuppoſed, the diſeaſe aſſumed a leſs malignant aſpect.</p>
                  <p>The peſtilential condition of the air at Providence in 1797, manifeſted itſelf very early in the ſeaſon; the firſt death occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as early as May 5th—the next on the 25th of June—the third on the 4th of July—the fourth on the 27th—the fifth on the 29th, and the ſixth on the firſt of Auguſt. The ſymptoms in all theſe caſes, were the predominant ones of the true yellow
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:036687_0332_100AA30B0B018CF8"/>
fever; and the bodies exhibited more or leſs petechiae and bices. Theſe caſes occurred <hi>before</hi> the arrival of the ſchooner, to which popular clamor afterwards imputed the whole evil. Theſe were the ſcattered precurſors, which, had the ſubject of peſtilence ever been inveſtigated, with philoſophical ingenuity and Chriſtian candor, would have rendered the epidemic a prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able event to the citizens of Providence, as early as July and would have taught them to uſe all human means to avoid or miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the calamity.</p>
                  <p>On the 8th of Auguſt arrived the ſchooner Betſey, Capt. Barton, from the Mole of Cape Nicholas, after 24 days paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Her cargo was only a few hogſheads of coffee. She lay at the wharf, till the 20th, when an increaſing alarm from new caſes of the fever induced the police to order her to be removed and cleanſed.</p>
                  <p>On enquiry, it was found that three of the ſchooner's people had been ill in the Weſt-Indies, but no one died. One of theſe only had been ill on the paſſage, but had recovered ſo as to do duty, ſeven days before her arrival. There were five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on board, during the paſſage, none of whom were affected by diſeaſe from infection or other cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The death of Mr. Arnold, the cuſtom-houſe officer, who was ſaid to have viſited the ſchooner, and ſeveral of his family, gave riſe to the report that the fever began from fomes on board of her. This point will be hereafter diſproved. Certain it is, that another officer of the cuſtoms ſlept on board of the ſchoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>ſeven</hi> nights; another <hi>five,</hi> and another young man <hi>two</hi> nights, with Brown, the owner of the blankets hereafter to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; all of whom eſcaped diſeaſe of any kind.</p>
                  <p>It was alſo ſaid that the woman who waſhed two blankets, belonging to a diſeaſed ſeaman, took the fever and died. On inveſtigation, this proved to be an idle tale. The blankets were owned by one Brown, who had not been ſick; and not having any uſe for them in warm weather, they had lain in his cheſt. On his arrival, they were carried home, ſpread out on the fence to air; they were then carried to his ſiſter's to be waſhed and lay two days before the work was undertaken. The day
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:036687_0333_100AA346C4BCA968"/>
after the waſhing, the women were taken ill; which was two early for the operation of infection, unleſs highly concentrated. But in fact the blankets were not infected; never having been uſed by any diſeaſed perſon; and the mother and others who handled them, when firſt opened, never had the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>But ſtronger circumſtances attended this caſe. The blanket belonging to Rophy, the only ſick man, on the paſſage, and his other clothes, worn during his fever, and colored yellow, by his perſpiration, were carried to his houſe; the blanket ſpread out for children to play on, before it was waſhed; afterwards waſhed by his wife; and no perſon took any diſeaſe from his clothes or blanket.</p>
                  <p>Such are tales of imported diſeaſes, raiſed by ignorance and propagated by intereſt, pride or credulity, to which the buſineſs of the merchants and the commerce of the country are to be ſacrificed!</p>
                  <p>Many other reports were ſpread about the infection from this ſchooner which, upon ſtrict enquiry, were found to be equally groundleſs. Such as the introduction of the fever into Warren, where the veſſel ſtopped, on her way to Providence. The caſe was, one Cole, an officer of the cuſtoms, ſculled a large boat a mile or two, againſt the tide, in a foggy evening; went on board, wet and fatigued; without refreſhment or change of clothes, ſlept in a cabin with broken windows, took a ſevere cold; repeated his viſit to the ſchooner the next day; on the third day went to Providence, a diſtance of ten miles in the rain; tarried two nights without a change of clothes; returned on foot, and was taken ill of a bilious fever and died in about ſeven days. Yet after all this fatigue and imprudence in the man, enough in all conſcience to kill him, men are found weak enough to charge his diſeaſe to the ſchooner.</p>
                  <p>But it happens, that other ſimilar caſes of fever occurred in Warren, in perſons who had never viſited Cole or the ſchooner; and one at the diſtance of three miles from the town. The whole tale therefore comes to nothing.</p>
                  <p>One fact more, and I will quit the ſubject of correcting the popular errors on this head. The men belonging to the ſchooner
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:036687_0334_100AA30F31DF41F8"/>
were diſmiſſed at Providence and returned to their families, with their ſea clothes of courſe. My informant took pains to enquire of every family, whether any of them had been infected; and he found not one inſtance, altho the families conſiſted of about forty ſouls!—The caſe of the unfortunate family of Mr. Arnold would a ford ſome ſlight ground to ſuſpect the infection to be communicated from the ſchooner to him or his ſon, the latter having viſited her;<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not rendered certain that the father had been on board; but that the ſon had, is not queſtioned; ſo had at leaſt one hundred others, who were not afterward affected with the diſeaſe.</note> but it happens that Mr. Arnold's wife, who had <hi>not</hi> been on board, nor otherwiſe expoſed, was ſeized fifty-ſix hours <hi>before</hi> her ſon and more than three days <hi>before</hi> her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Thus the reports of infection from abroad, when well ſifted, vaniſh into ſmoke; and I am perſuaded this would gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be the reſult, if men would be faithful to themſelves, to truth and their country.</p>
                  <p>On the 12th of Auguſt, the fever took a more rapid ſpread, probably from a ſudden alarm by the burning of two tons of hemp, by means of a ſpark from a blackſmith's ſhop, as it was paſſing the door. This was four days after the arrival of the ſchooner, and occaſioned the popular clamor which was raiſed about her infection. But the appearance of the diſeaſe long <hi>before</hi> her arrival is deciſive of the queſtion.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe had its own atmoſphere; raging moſtly in a part of Providence much expoſed to the effluvia of great collections of filth in vaults, from a diſtillery, and in other places. Some caſes however occurred in other ſituations; and many parts of the ſtate exhibited the peſtilential principle, in ſporadic caſes, or local epidemics, as at Briſtol, Warren, Greenwich, Indian Point, Glouceſter, Warwick, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In Providence, the diſeaſe affected fifty-ſix families—8 before the arrival of the ſchooner, and 48 afterwards. In 33 of theſe families, only one perſon in each, had the fever; and as ſome of the families are large, the infecting principle could not have been very powerful. In the large houſe, where lived the women who were firſt taken ill, after the ſchooner arrived, reſided 9
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:036687_0335_100AA349DB0505D0"/>
families, conſiſting of 37 perſons, only 12 of which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. In the hoſpital the nurſes and attendants <hi>all</hi> eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>Some inſtances of this diſeaſe appeared in the following win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and there were caſes alſo of the ulcerous ſore throat. In the north part of the town, ſome caſes of the yellow fever oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in the laſt ſummer—1798.</p>
                  <p>In 1797 a malignant fever is ſaid to have been introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a village in Chatham, on Connecticut river, by a veſſel from the Weſt-Indies. I underſtand that it was confined to a cluſter of houſes by the water; but I have not been able to collect the facts in detail, altho I have written letters for the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>During the late peſtilential period, the ſtate of the atmoſphere produced its uſual effects in winter; which appeared in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſymptoms of pleuriſy and peripneumony.</p>
                  <p>It has already been remarked that in periods when plague and other mortal epidemics rage in ſummer, the diſeaſes of winter aſſume new ſymptoms. The pleuriſy, at ſuch times, has often become epidemic and even infectious. It is in fact a modification of the ſame peſtilential principle, as that which renders bilious fevers in ſummer epidemic and infectious. The fatal effects of this ſpecies of pleuriſy in Connecticut, in the winter of 1761, have been mentioned.</p>
                  <p>In the winter of 1795-6, after the epidemic in New-York, ſeveral caſes of a ſimilar kind occurred, and an able phyſician of plethoric habit and ſtrong fibres, fell a victim to a peripneumony, with anomalous ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>In the following winter, a ſimilar diſorder attacked many people in Connecticut. Three men in Hartford, of one family, two brothers and a couſin, all men of robuſt health, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked and carried off in the compaſs of a few days. Others of the ſame family, and ſeveral perſons of a ſimilar habit were affected, but recovered. It was far leſs general than in 1761.</p>
                  <p>This ſpecies of pleuriſy appeared in Philadelphia as early as September 1791, the month when the malignant fever prevailed in New-York. A patient of Dr. Ruſh had a "red face, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med eyes, a perpetual toſſing and ſighing, ſtrong animal powers, but weak pulſe and ſizy blood." In February 1792 many caſes of ſimilar pleuritic fevers occurred in Philadelphia—diſeaſes aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:036687_0336_100AA3136B9593D8"/>
the inflammatory diatheſis which has remarkably charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terized the epidemic of the laſt peſtilential period.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpring of the year 1798, a mortal fever raged in Fred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ericktown, Maryland, beginning with laſſitude, chills and pain in the head, and producing, on the third day, vertigo and ſpaſm in the breaſt.</p>
                  <bibl>Letter from Dr. Baltzell to Dr. Ruſh, dated May 2, 1798.</bibl>
                  <p>In ſummer and autumn of 1797, a malignant fever, attended with dyſentery, was epidemic in Portland and its vicinity, in the diſtrict of Maine. The dyſentery ſubſided in October, but the fever continued. It appeared in the country, as well as town; and was uſually conquered by the uſe of alkaline reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Many of the patients had a yellow ſkin and the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſymptoms of the yellow fever of our cities. In one inſtance, this diſeaſe put on the form of peſtilence. A merchant, in a country village, where no ſuſpicion of infection could be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, was ſeized with a malignant fever; he lingered till the 36th day, and died highly putrid. His nurſe was ſeized and died; after death appeared livid ſpots on the body. A ſervant alſo took the diſeaſe and died. The nurſe communicated the diſeaſe to three perſons in the family where ſhe lay ill.</p>
                  <p>This laſt inſtance is deciſive evidence that the peſtilential yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever not only originates in our country, but in villages, in the 44th degree of latitude, a more temperate climate than that of New-York and Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>In the winter ſucceeding, the peſtilential principle ſtill exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited its effects. The fever continued to prevail, being uſhered in with nauſea, vomiting and chills ſucceeded by heat; but it was generally accompanied with a ſore throat and ſcarlet efflo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſcence. It prevailed in almoſt every town in the county.</p>
                  <bibl>Dr. Barker's letter, Med. Repoſ. vol. 2. 147.</bibl>
                  <p>The year 1798 was remarkable for the moſt general preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the plague of our climate, that has been known; and in ſome cities, the diſeaſe was peculiarly malignant.</p>
                  <p>The preceding winter had been unuſually long and cold—the May following was dry beyond what is recollected in any former years—June was remarkable for deluging rains, which occaſioned floods in the Connecticut, Delaware and Suſquehannah rivers,
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:036687_0337_100AA34C30414D50"/>
which did no inconſiderable injury. Two or three of the firſt days of July were exceſſively hot, and ſucceeded by twenty days of very cool weather—then commenced a long period of the moſt ſultry weather ever known in our climate, accompanied, in ſome places, with great rains.</p>
                  <p>Catarrhous fevers were frequent in the ſpring, the conſtant forerunners of autumnal ſickneſs. Bilious fevers alſo occurred, in a few caſes very early, indicating the predominant condition of the atmoſphere. In ſummer and autumn, the graſs-hoppers multiplied to ſuch a degree from Pennſylvania to New-England, as to devour vegetables, and eſſentially injure the paſtures and graſs fields.</p>
                  <p>The peſtilential fever in Philadelphia appeared early in the ſeaſon—a number of caſes in June, and ſtill more in July. In Auguſt early, the city was alarmed and ſoon deſerted by at leaſt three fourths of its inhabitants. The diſeaſe was unuſually mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and extended to the remoteſt parts of the city, where it had not formerly prevailed. Owing to this circumſtance, ſome families ſuffered, which had eſcaped in former years. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of deaths amounted to about 3440. The diſeaſe, as uſual, abated with the appearance of froſt; but individuals were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with it, and carried off, in the midſt of the following winter.</p>
                  <p>It is alledged by ſome perſons that the fever was introduced into Philadelphia by the ſhip Deborah, which arrived from Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emie, and anchored near Race-ſtreet wharf, on the 18th of July. It is admitted that perſons who went on board, ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſickened and died; and ſo did others ſicken and die, without going near that ſhip. The truth is, many caſes of the diſeaſe had occurred three or four weeks, <hi>before her arrival.</hi> The ſhip had loſt people by fever on her paſſage and might be infected; and perſons viſiting her might receive that infection; but theſe facts do not reach the point. The epidemic <hi>began</hi> in all parts of the city, in ſcattering caſes, <hi>previous to the arrival of this fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> and had the ſhip never arrived, that epidemic would have ravaged the city. This is evident from the number of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſors.</p>
                  <p>This peſtilential fever carried off fifty-ſeven perſons in the

village of Marcus Hook, where the firſt perſons ſeized were a ſhallop-man and others from Philadelphia. But many caſes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred which could be traced to no infection. See Dr. Sayre's letter in Currie's Memoirs, p. 136. In Cheſter died 50 of the ſame fever.</p>
                  <p>At Wilmington, in the ſtate of Delaware, thirty miles from Philadelphia, the ſame diſeaſe raged with more than its ordinary mortality. Its victims amounted to 250. It appears that the diſeaſe was introduced by the fugitives from Philadelphia, and by watermen who ply between Wilmington and Philadelphia.</p>
                  <bibl>See Dr. Tilton's letter in Dr. Currie's Memoirs, p. 138.</bibl>
                  <p>The fever alſo prevailed in New-Caſtle and at Duck creek in the ſame ſtate.</p>
                  <p>Letters from reſpectable phyſicians, in the public prints, have informed us that this diſeaſe prevailed alſo in ſome parts of New-Jerſey, as at Bridgetown and Woodbury; and eſpecially near the meadows on the borders of the Delaware. From careful examination, it was found that the diſeaſe muſt have originated where it exiſted; no intercourſe having been held with infected places. In ſome inſtances the fever was probably infectious.</p>
                  <p>At Norwalk in Connecticut ſeveral perſons died of the ſame diſtemper. The phyſicians are doubtful as to its origin; as ſome caſes may be traced to a diſeaſed perſon who had been in New-York. Three caſes however occurred at ſome miles diſtance from the heart of the town, in perſons who had not been in the leaſt expoſed to infection.</p>
                  <bibl>M. S. letter from Dr. Betts.</bibl>
                  <p>In the firſt week of Auguſt, appeared a bilious fever in New-York, between Old ſlip and Coenties ſlip, in the ſtreet next to the water; a place remarked for great accumulations of filthy ſubſtances. By the exertions of the Health Commiſſioners, in covering theſe nuiſances with freſh earth, this alarming fever ſubſided in that neighborhood, and diſappeared by the 26th of that month.</p>
                  <p>But on the 12th, the peſtilential fever appeared in other parts of the city, and about the 20th, began to extend and aſſume a more formidable aſpect. The diſtrict of the city, ſubjected to its moſt deadly effects, was that ſection comprehended between
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:036687_0339_100AA34E855A02A8"/>
John-ſtreet and Beekman-ſtreet, particularly in Cliff-ſtreet and its neighborhood. The probable cauſe of this effect, was the fetid air from large quantities of ſpoiled beef, ſtored in the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in Pearl-ſtreet, on the windward ſide of this ſection. The cellars were filled with water by heavy rains, or were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe damp; which circumſtance, added to the extreme heat of the ſeaſon, occaſioned a greater loſs of ſalted proviſions, than perhaps was ever before known. To augment the effect, large quantities of pickle had been diſcharged, in the proceſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>packing beef not yet ſpoiled, but in a bad ſtate, which pickle had been carried by the gutters into a ſewer in Burling ſlip, from which iſſued a very offenſive ſmell.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>There is reaſon to believe, that ſalt, if not ſufficient to preſerve the article to which it is applied, renders it doubly noxious in a ſtate of putrefaction; and that a ſmall quantity of ſalt will accelerate the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of putrefaction. From an experiment related to me by Mr. Moſes Brown of Providence, it is proved that a piece of fleſh, in pure water, will not putrefy as ſoon as in water, in which a few grains of ſalt have been diſſolved.</p>
                        <p>Do not the ſaline particles of the air, on the ſea coaſt, render the putrefaction of fleſh and vegetables more rapid, and the exhalations more deleterious, than perfectly freſh water? And is not this one cauſe, why peſtilential diſeaſes appear firſt, and are moſt general, in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time places?</p>
                        <p>Dr. Cogſwell informs me that a boat-man on Connecticut river, in the hot weather of 1798, contracted a violent fever of which he died, by ſleeping in an open boat, near a quantity of pickle which had leaked out of a barrel of ſalted proviſions. The diſeaſe was of a very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant kind.</p>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the laſt of Auguſt, the inhabitants of New-York were greatly alarmed; ſome removed from the eaſt to the weſt ſide of Broadway, a part of the city which has hitherto been exempted from the violent effects of the yellow fever; but a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the people deſerted the city. The diſeaſe was more malignant, than in its preceding viſits, and exhibited more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the bubo and carbuncle. It extended over two thirds of the city, and numbered with the dead about two thouſand of its inhabitants. I am informed the diſeaſe was leſs generally characterized with the inflammatory diatheſis, and that veneſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was leſs generally attended with ſalutary effects, than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer years.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe exhibited little infection, beyond the limits of its own amoſphere. In the hoſpital, at a little diſtance from the
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:036687_0340_100AA317341B10C8"/>
city, were admitted about 300 patients, ill with that diſeaſe; yet ſixteen nurſes, ſeven waſherwomen, and the boatmen who conveyed the ſick from the city to the hoſpital, <hi>all eſcaped.</hi> Dr. Douglaſs, the attending phyſician, eſcaped the diſeaſe, until October, when he viſited his friends and ſlept <hi>in the city,</hi> three days after which he was ſeized with the fever.</p>
                  <bibl>See Letters from the Health-Office, by Dr. Bailey, whoſe zeal, talents and induſtry, in his employment, have rarely been equalled.</bibl>
                  <p>The laſt fact is very important towards correcting the popular errors reſpecting the contagion of this fever. In the city per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons took the fever—in the hoſpital they did not. That is, the diſtemper has an atmoſphere, in which it is readily contracted— beyond that atmoſphere, it is not infectious. In other words, it is a <hi>condition of the atmoſphere,</hi> and <hi>not the effluvia from the ſick,</hi> which is to be dreaded.</p>
                  <p>Thus, in 1797, the fugitives and ſick from Philadelphia did <hi>not</hi> ſpread the fever in Wilmington—in 1798, they did. That is, in 1797 the atmoſphere of Wilmington would not <hi>generate</hi> and <hi>nurſe</hi> the diſeaſe—in 1798, it would.</p>
                  <p>In Boſton, the diſeaſe began near the town dock and the neighboring wharves, in the month of June; but its moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent effects were experienced on the ſouth ſide of Fort-Hill, an elevated part of the town and expoſed to free air. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance has occaſioned no ſmall ſurpriſe; but as the fever of 1796 began in that part of the town, perhaps we may find the cauſe in the very extenſive flat, between Boſton and Dorcheſter point, which is uncovered at low water; perhaps in the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that hill to the direct rays of the ſun; perhaps in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſoil which is clay of a ſolid texture, and fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain on its ſurface whatever impure ſubſtances are thrown from houſes.</p>
                  <p>The fever afterwards invaded the north part of the town, and a ſtreet near the pond; ſuppoſed to be excited by noxious exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. Some parts of the town, which are low and filthy, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the fever.</p>
                  <p>At firſt it attacked the moſt robuſt young men, and the diath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſis was highly inflammatory. Later in the ſeaſon, it attacked
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:036687_0341_100AA35100B63870"/>
perſons of all ages and habits. At firſt it was not infectious, but in the later ſtages of its progreſs, it exhibited infection. Is diſappeared with the arrival of froſt, after carrying off nearly 200 patients.</p>

                  <p>See a full account of the diſeaſe in a letter from Dr. Rand, publiſhed by order of the Academy of Arts and Sciences. This gentleman obſerves that no infection appeared, except in places where the diſeaſe was originally contracted.<note n="*" place="bottom">That is, infection was attached to the <hi>place,</hi> rather than to the <hi>perſons</hi> of the diſeaſed—a fact which is true of every peſtilence.</note>

                  <p>The ſame malady appeared in Portſmouth, New-Hampſhire, with equal mortality, as far as it extended; but its progreſs was limited to one ſtreet near the water.</p>
                  <p>New-London, in Connecticut, is ſituated in a very healthy part of the country, on a harbor, whoſe ſhores as well as the ſurrounding lands, are dry and rocky—its population about 3000 inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt week in Auguſt 1798, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> town was ſuddenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by the plague of our country, which began in the family of Mr. Bingham, keeper of the Union coffee-houſe. No veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels from the Weſt-Indies, no ſick from other places, occur, in this inſtance, to help out popular credulity. The idea of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation is abandoned by the citizens of the town. The fever was very fatal within its atmoſphere, which was confined to Bank ſtreet and its vicinity; a part of the city well built, clean and airy as any ſtreet in the town. Within a ſmall ſpace, were fifteen houſes, inhabited by ninety-two perſons—of which ninety were affected with the diſeaſe; thirty-three of this number died, and two only eſcaped the fever. The diſeaſe prevailed about eight weeks and deſtroyed eighty-one lives.</p>
                  <bibl>Printed account of the fever by Charles Holt.</bibl>
                  <p>On enquiry I find that this diſeaſe in New-London had its precurſors, in ſporadic caſes of the ſame fever, in the three pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſummers. In 1795, died Dr. Joſeph W. Lee with all the ſymptoms of the yellow fever. Some inſtances occurred in
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:036687_0342_100AA318D943D5A0"/>
1796; and in 1797 died of the ſame, Matthew Griſwold, Eſq. and ſoon after his mother; indicating the communication of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Yet in theſe years, it did not ſpread and become epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic. The peſtilential period however was progreſſing in that town, as appears by the bills of mortality; for the ordinary number of deaths does not exceed 60 in a healthy year; but in 1795, the number amounted to 86—in 1796, to 80—in 1797, to 101—in 1798, to 133. Here we obſerve a great augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the mortality of the town, ſeveral years before the criſis of peſtilence, and eſpecially in the year next preceding it. The importance of this fact towards a right underſtanding of the cauſes of epidemic peſtilence, cannot be miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>Conſiderable quantities of ſalted fiſh, which lay in certain ſtores in New-London, and which had not been well cured with the uſual quantity of ſalt, became fetid and offenſive, altho not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid, and aſſumed a red caſt with a ſlimy feeling—it alſo loſt its texture and firmneſs. This was opened and ſpread in the ſtreets for the purpoſe of being dried; and from its offenſiveneſs and vicinity to the place where the diſeaſe firſt appeared, it is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to have been an exciting cauſe of the fever. This opinion has doubtleſs ſome foundation; but putrid fiſh will not always occaſion diſeaſe. It is probably true that the bad ſtate of the fiſh was partly owing to a previous bad ſtate of the air; altho it afterwards became a <hi>cauſe</hi> of a <hi>worſe ſtate</hi> of the air.</p>
                  <p>What ſeems to put this beyond doubt, is, the unuſual number of muſketoes, in the adjacent country, and the multitudes of flies of uncommon ſize, exceeding what had been before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. With theſe phenomena before our eyes, we can be at no loſs to account for the peſtilential fever of New-London.</p>
                  <p>The uſual lake and river fever prevailed in the ſame ſeaſon, in many of the interior parts of the country; as at Royalton in Vermont, on the Grand Iſles in Lake Champlain, at New-Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford in Connecticut, and in various parts of the ſtate of New-York; in which places, it was attended with conſiderable mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Sporadic caſes occurred in all parts, and in the healthieſt ſituations, of the country. In many places, intermittents and dyſentery were unuſually violent and obſtinate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="339" facs="unknown:036687_0343_100A89BFFB4654E8"/>I have no account of the temperature of the weather in any part of Europe, during the ſummer of 1798; except that in ſome parts of Sweden, the firſt months of the ſummer were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively dry, as the month of May was in America.</p>
                  <p>A peſtilential fever appeared in Italy in June; but I have no details of its progreſs. It is however to be obſerved that this fever was preceded by a violent earthquake in ſome part of the Tuſcan territories, in the month of May, which did no ſmall injury.</p>
                  <p>In autumn broke out a peſtilential fever on the Baltic, in Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick or its vicinity. The government of Denmark, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of official information of the prevalence of this diſeaſe, directed all ſhips from Dantzick and the neighboring ports to be watched with vigilance, and appointed a committee of quarantine.</p>
                  <p>According to the report of a maſter of a veſſel, there was an eruption in Teneriffe in the ſummer of 1798, which laſted ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral weeks. This volcano had been quiet for 94 years.</p>
                  <p>In November and December, the peſtilence in America was ſucceeded as uſual by influenza, which was very prevalent in all parts of the country, and in the ſouthern ſtates attended with ſome mortality. This was merely a change of the form of the epidemic.</p>
                  <p>The winter of 1798-9 was very long and ſevere in both hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſpheres. In the United States, it began about the middle of November, with ſnow, and a heavy fall of ſnow on the 18th and 19th was followed by ſevere cold that laſted till the ſecond week in January. From this time, there was a relaxation of cold for about three weeks, and the ice in Connecticut river gave way. But in February commenced ſevere cold, which contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, for the moſt part to the vernal equinox. April was alſo cold; ſevere froſts occurred often, and checked vegetation. On the 2d and 8th of May were conſiderable falls of ſnow, followed by froſt. On the morning of the 4th and 5th, we had ice at New-Haven as thick as window-glaſs. Peaches bloſſomed about the middle of May, and apples were not in full bloom, till the 22d. This long duration of cold exhauſted all the barns of hay and other fodder, and multitudes of cattle periſhed in various parts of the country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="340" facs="unknown:036687_0344_100AA31CE3DA8B08"/>In Europe, the winter was equally ſevere. The rivers in England, Germany, Holland and France were covered with ſolid ice, and at the breaking up of winter, the Rhine roſe and burſt its barriers, inundating many parts of Holland with terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſtruction. The ſeverity of the winter was felt even in the ſouth of Italy, and the French and Neapolitan troops ſuffered greatly from ſnow on the Appenine, in the vicinity of Naples. In Siberia, we are informed by the public prints, periſhed whole villages of men and cattle by the ſeverity of the froſt.</p>
                  <p>In America, the diſeaſes of the winter were characterized by the predominant diatheſis of the reigning epidemic conſtitution, a yellow ſkin and bilious diſcharges. An earthquake of conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable extent was felt in the Carolinas on the 12th of April. What will be the ſtate of health in the enſuing ſummer, muſt be left to be determined by the event. The preſent peſtilence has been long and ſevere and the citizens look with impatience, for the uſual ſalubrious ſtate of their atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>In Auguſt, about the time the peſtilence began to ſhow itſelf in New-York, immenſe numbers of flies died ſuddenly, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned no ſmall ſpeculation and alarm.

                  <head>POSTSCRIPT. Additional facts, collected on a journey which I made through the Northern States, while this volume was in the preſs.</head>
                  <p>IN the autumn of 1732 raged in New-York a malignant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious fever, of which died ſeventy perſons in a few weeks.</p>
                  <bibl>M. S. of Mr. Alexander.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1745 a malignant bilious fever prevailed in New-York, of which died an eminent phyſician of the city, Dr. Nicoll. By the deſcription of the diſeaſe, given to me by a gentleman who was affected with it, there appears to be no queſtion that it was the ſame diſeaſe now called yellow fever.</p>
                  <p>About this time, for the year is not exactly known, a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant epidemic diſeaſe laid waſte the Indian tribes. By the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the ſymptoms, as given by Indian traders, then among the tribes, and ſtill living, it is certain this was the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious yellow fever. In conſequence of this diſtemper, the Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas removed their quarters two or three times, in a few years—it being a practice among the natives to abandon the place infected with this plague. The diſeaſe was confined to the Indians—the white people, living and trading with them, not being affected.</p>
                  <p>In 1746 the Mohegan tribe of Indians, between New-Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Norwich, was waſted by the ſame malady. Dr. Tracy of Norwich now deceaſed, was the only white man affected—he attended them as their phyſician. From Mr. Philemon Tracy, a ſon of the doctor, who has taken the trouble to examin a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hegan prieſt, a man of good ſenſe and integrity, who was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affected by the diſorder, I have the following account of this peſtilence.—That it appeared in Auguſt and prevailed till cold weather—that about one hundred of the tribe periſhed— that it was the year after the reduction of Cape Breton (of courſe
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:036687_0346_100AA31E69FAF6A8"/>
in 1746—and Dr. Tracy's books confirm the dates mentioned by the Indian)—that the patient firſt complained of a ſevere pain in the head and back, which was followed by fever—in three or four days, the ſkin turned as yellow as gold, a vomiting of black matter took place and generally a bleeding at the noſe and mouth, which continued, till the patient died. Theſe are the words of the old Indian, as penned at the time by my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formant.</p>
                  <p>It will be remarked that this was a local peſtilence, the fever being confined to a ſingle tribe of Indians and not prevailing in the neighboring towns. But it will be remarked alſo that this was the ſame year, it prevailed in Albany, when the bills of mortality were generally high.</p>
                  <p>I have aſcertained that the canker-worm, which lately ravaged the fruit trees in New-England, appeared as early as 1788 or 1789.</p>
                  <p>A fatal malignant diſeaſe raged among the tribes of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawk Indians, about the year 1776, and reduced ſome of them to a few men.</p>
                  <p>From Dr. Wheeler of Redhook, on the Hudſon, I learn that the angina ſcarlatina appeared there in January 1789 and prevailed till April—it prevailed alſo in the two ſucceeding win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                  <p>The influenza, in that year, firſt appeared there about the middle of October, and prevailed two months, among all ages and both ſexes. Catarrhal coughs have been prevalent every year, ſince that time. In the ſpring of 1793, angina ſcarlatina, mumps and catarrhal coughs prevailed till June, and diſappeared. Soon after commenced the remitting fever. In ſome caſes the paroxyſms invaded the patient in the form of madneſs.</p>
                  <p>The reader will note that in our interior country, the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fever of that diſtinguiſhed year, 1793, had nearly the ſame ſpring precurſors, as the yellow fever in Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>The meaſles at Redhook in 1795, partook of the character of the preceding epidemic fevers; beginning with a highly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diatheſis, and ſometimes ending in typhus, with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiae, vibices and hemorrhagy. Pleuriſies had the ſame char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter.</p>

                     <pb n="343" facs="unknown:036687_0347_100AA35855D0A3F8"/>At Brattleborough, on the Connecticut, a family by the name of Morgan were ſeized in 1791 with a fever of the typhus kind, and ſix of them died. Several perſons who viſited the family took the diſeaſe and died, and there its progreſs ended. The family reſides in a healthy ſituation, near a ſmall active ſtream of water; and no viſible cauſe could be aſſigned for the origin of this diſtemper. Theſe facts are taken from Dr. Hall of that town. It will be remembered that this was the year when au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal diſeaſes firſt put on the malignant aſpect of our late peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, when the plague broke out in Egypt and the yellow fever in the Weſt-Indies began to aſſume what Dr. Chiſholm calls unuſual ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Center of Newport informs me that in 1798 occurred in that place many caſes of a bilious fever bearing ſome reſemblance to the infectious fever; and one caſe of decided carbuncular and glandular plague, in a man of robuſt conſtitution. There is no pretence of foreign origin, in any of thoſe caſes.</p>
                  <p>From ſundry gentlemen living in Chelſea, a village at the landing in Norwich, I learn that two or three caſes of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant bilious fever occurred there in 1798, marked with the uſual ſymptoms of the infectious fever. Some of theſe caſes could not poſſibly have been derived from infection. One of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients might have contracted his diſeaſe at New-London.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Holyoke of Salem, in Maſſachuſetts, informs me that in 1798, many caſes of malignant bilious fever occurred in that town, which could not have been derived from infection.</p>
                  <p>From Dr. Woodruff and Dr. M'Clellan of Albany, I learn that ſeveral caſes of malignant bilious fever appeared in that city, in 1798, marked with all the ſymptoms of the peſtilence of our cities and which muſt have originated in that place. About one half who were ſeized, died.</p>
                  <p>The firſt caſe of influenza at Albany in 1789 is noted by Dr. M'Clellan to have occurred on the 30th of September. This was preciſely the time of its appearance at Philadelphia, and a little after its firſt appearance at New-York. In the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, between New-York and Albany, it did not appear till a week or two later. Theſe facts prove that this diſeaſe falls on diſtant places at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="344" facs="unknown:036687_0348_100AA3200D655A10"/>The ſcarlatina anginoſa appeared at Albany in the winter and ſpring of 1793, about the time it did in New-York and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.</p>
                  <p>In every part of our country, one remark has been made by phyſicians, that from the year 1792 or 3, intermittents and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents have become more numerous and obſtinate, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with unuſual ſymptoms. In many places, theſe diſeaſes have been multiplied in a ten-fold ratio; elucidating the principles of the great Sydenham, relative to "Conſtitutions of Air," and demonſtrating the exiſtence of a general cauſe in the inſenſible properties of the atmoſphere, to which we may and muſt aſcribe the peſtilence of our maritime towns.</p>
                  <p>In 1798 multitudes of dead pike were obſerved to float down the Mohawk and Hudſon.</p>
                  <p>From Dr. Thatcher I learn that for ſome years paſt, an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal fever has prevailed in Plymouth, in Maſſachuſetts, of the remitting kind, with low typhus ſymptoms. In winter it takes the type of the nervous fever. It was very prevalent in 1798 in that and a neighboring town.</p>
                  <p>From Dr. Smith of Hanover, in New-Hampſhire, and Drs. Green and Traſk of Windſor, in Vermont, I have obtained information reſpecting a very infectious fever which prevailed in thoſe towns and the vicinity in 1798. This diſeaſe is deſcribed by Dr. Spalding in the Medical Repoſitory, vol. 3. p. 5. It approaches nearly to the typhus mitior of Cullen, but the fiery red eye at the invaſion ſeems to indicate its alliance to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious fever of our cities; and it reſembles the diſeaſe known by the popular name of long fever.</p>
                  <p>This fever, in Windſor and Hanover, was preceded by dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entery of uncommon malignancy in 1797, which, in Windſor, was attended with an unuſual inflammation of the lungs. The diſeaſe which preceded theſe epidemics was the ſcarlatina angino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, which was very prevalent in 1796.</p>
                  <p>It is worthy of notice that in all parts of our country, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal infectious fevers have had precurſors in other epidemics, eſpecially catarrhal complaints and anginas. I do not find an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to this remark.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="unknown:036687_0349_100AA35AB9D50208"/>This fever at Windſor deſerves further to be noticed for its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious or contagious quality. It was far <hi>leſs</hi> fatal, but <hi>more</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious than the yellow fever of our cities. Nurſes often took the diſeaſe, and when they returned to their dwellings in diſtant towns, rarely failed to communicate it to the whole family. This is a phenomenon rarely, perhaps never exhibited by the peſtilence of our maritime towns, which has an atmoſphere of its own out of which it is not communicated.</p>
                  <p>I have examined perſonally the poſitions of many of the towns where this fever and dyſentery have been moſt prevalent, and I find no where any marſh that can rationally be ſuppoſed to originate theſe diſtempers. In general the towns are ſituated on a baſis of clay, between high ridges of land or mountains, where the heat of the ſun is greatly concentrated, and on the margin of rivers. To this deſcription, there are ſome exceptions as to the ſoil; ſome towns being on ſand or gravel. The neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood of freſh ſtreams of water cannot be admitted as a cauſe of theſe fevers—nothing being more falubrious than ſuch ſtreams. But I am perſuaded from careful obſervation, that, under a peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential conſtitution of air, great heat is the immediate exciting cauſe of autumnal fevers, in ſituations not expoſed to marſh effluvia.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the origin of the peſtilential fever in Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, in 1798, the facts are as follow.</p>
                  <p>A laboring man, who was given to liquor, received his wages on Saturday evening. He was ſeized with the malignant fever, and died on the next Wedneſday. While he lay ill, a veſſel arrived which had loſt a man or two by the fever on her voyage, but no perſon was ill on board, at the time of her arrival. Some of the perſons who afterwards died of the fever, had been on board of that veſſel; but whether they took the diſeaſe from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or not, cannot be known. The firſt caſe occurred <hi>before</hi> the arrival. This is an agreed point. I have theſe facts from two of the principal gentlemen of that town, one of them a reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble phyſician; the other, the perſon who paid the wages to the man who firſt died. All my enquiries have been made at the ſources of correct information; and I find every where <hi>popular reports</hi> are falſe or incorrect. Yet popular reports are received as truth by many phyſicians and writers, and are made the baſis of falſe and pernicious theories, both in America and Europe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="346" facs="unknown:036687_0350_100AA35CB9676770"/>The fever in Portſmouth was limited in its progreſs to the northern part of the town. In the ſouthern part, at the ſame time, prevailed a malignant dyſentery, which was as mortal as the fever in the northern part. The line of diviſion was drawn by a wide ſtreet or ſquare on which ſtands the court-houſe. The ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let fever had been prevalent in the town for two years preceding.</p>
                  <p>In 1799, the preſent ſummer, many perſons have taken the peſtilential fever from veſſels arrived from the Weſt-Indies; but in moſt, or all caſes, the fever has become extinct, without any conſiderable mortality. In Boſton, the mortality was limited to two or three perſons.</p>
                  <p>The caſe at Newburyport was ſingular. A veſſel went and returned from the Weſt-Indies, without a caſe of malignant fever; but as ſhe arrived at the mouth of the river Merrimack, 18 days from St. Thomas's, a boy was ſeized with the fever, and afterwards one or two others Several perſons took the diſeaſe and died; but people left the vicinity, and the diſorder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came extinct. This was a fever generated on board of the veſſel.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of the ſummer of 1799, tho late, was favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to vegeta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But in July commenced a moſt diſtreſſing drouth, in all the northern ſtates; and particularly in the middle ſtates, and the interior country; by which the maize, buck-wheat and potatoes were greatly injured. In ſome parts of the ſtate of New-York, the maize was totally deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Over the eaſtern ſtates, a ſpecies of caterpillar of ſmall ſize appeared in unparalleled numbers, covering the wild cherry-tree, the apple, the willow, the aſh, and the hickory. In ſome parts, a large caterpillar, with variegated colors, ſtripped the black oak of all its leaves. Graſs-hoppers were as numerous as the blades of graſs, and in ſome places, injured greatly the graſs and other vegetables. But eſpecially to be noted were the ſmall toads of the color deſcribed by Fernelius, "Coloris cineritii" like aſhes; of the ſize of a filbert, and in numbers not to be eſtimated. Theſe were numerous alſo in 1798. They anſwer the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe which medical writers of former ages obſerved to be the forerunners and companions of peſtilence. At what time

they appeared and diſappeared, is not exactly known—they were moſt generally obſerved in July.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpring prevailed influenza or catarrhal fevers; in ſome places cynanche maligna; and generally rheumatic complaints, and ſlight ulcerations of the throat. In many places, the fevers of winter were characterized with a yellow ſkin and bilious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges. All theſe marked the continuance of a peſtilential atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>The plague ſhowed itſelf early, in ſcattered caſes, in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia; but diſappeared, to the unſpeakable joy of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. Alas! When ſuch caſes appear in July, and eſpecially if other diſeaſes in winter and ſpring manifeſt ſymptoms of the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing epidemic, it is hardly poſſible that our cities ſhould eſcape a peſtilential fever in autumn. This terrible ſcourge renewed its ravages in Philadelphia and New-York; and in various parts of our country, bilious fevers appeared with malignant ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>At Hartford, on the Connecticut, appeared the malignant fever in Auguſt, to the ſurpriſe of the inhabitants and of the ſtate. People who have no juſt ideas of the nature and origin of this diſeaſe, attempted to find the cauſe in ſome veſſel from the Weſt-Indies; but being diſappointed, reſorted to a ſmall coaſting veſſel. On examination it appears, that this veſſel was uſed as a market boat between Connecticut river and New-York —the maſter had died in June, but of what diſeaſe, I am not able to learn. Another maſter took poſſeſſion of her, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her very dirty, with the remains of various vegetables, he overhauled her and gave her a thorough cleanſing. He took in at New-York a cargo of ſalt, and ſailed to New-Haven, where the veſſel lay ſome time, about the middle of July. Here the ſalt was purchaſed by a merchant of Hartford, and the veſſel ordered round to that place, where ſhe arrived and diſcharged her cargo, in the beginning of Auguſt. From the time the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel left New-York, to the time of diſcharging the ſalt, muſt have been from four to ſix weeks. After leaving Hartford, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the river, the maſter and mate of this veſſel were ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the fever and died. Inſtead therefore of being <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,</hi> the fever was <hi>exported.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some attempts were made to trace all the firſt caſes of the fever to that veſſel; but it does not appear that more than one

perſon who had the diſeaſe, was ever on board; and it is <hi>proved</hi> that moſt of the perſons affected were never near that veſſel and never viſited the ſick. It is proved further th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The truth is, the ſpot where this fever aroſe, is low ground, retaining water to ſtagnate after the ſpring floods—built upon in a crouded irregular manner— extremely filthy—penetrated by a creek which has been dried and neglected, and become the reſervoir of every unclean thing —in the vicinity is a ſlaughter-houſe, where loads of garbage contribute to render the air foul and noxious. Let any man walk over the ground and examin it with care, as I have done ſince the fever, and he will be convinced that no imported fomes was neceſſary, in that place, to breed a peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>But one of the ſtrongeſt arguments to prove the domeſtic ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the malady, is, what people rarely conſider. Numerous fevers of the remitting kind, and typhus mitior, have originated on the ſame ground, for ſeveral years paſt; and in 1798, two caſes of malignant yellow fever—one of which terminated in three days. Theſe fevers marked the predominant ſtate of that local atmoſphere, and decide the queſtion of domeſtic origin.</p>
                  <p>On the 15th of July a tremendous hail ſtorm paſſed over Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut from the weſtward, attended with violent wind and thunder. The ſtones and pieces of ice were of various ſizes, from that of a walnut to that of a hen's egg.

The champain country on the Connecticut was leſs injured. This ſtorm, unexampled in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, reſembles numberleſs hail ſtorms deſcribed in hiſtory, as the precurſors and companions of peſtilence.</p>

                  <head>SECTION IX. Bills of mortality for the two laſt centuries, with the principal phenomena of the elements.</head>
                  <p>OUR accounts of diſeaſes and the phenomena of the world, which appear to be connected with them, are altogether imperfect. But in the two laſt centuries, we have a tolerable hiſtory of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and occaſionally an account of the ſeaſons, and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble occurrences. In the following tables, the reader will find the bills of mortality for London, Augſburg, Dreſden, Boſton, one Church in Philadelphia, with a few bills of Paris and Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin; to which are prefixed ſuch of the remarkable phenomena of the elements, as I have been able to collect. As winter makes a part of two years, the word <hi>ſevere</hi> is ſet againſt the year which preceded the winter. Thus againſt the year 1607, the word <hi>ſevere</hi> refers to the winter of 1607-8. The blanks denote, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that nothing ſingular occurred in thoſe years, or that I have no account of the occurrences. Further enquiries might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enable me to fill many of thoſe blanks.</p>
                  <p>Bills of mortality do not exhibit a complete view of epidemics; as ſome of the more remarkable, eſpecially <hi>influenza,</hi> deſtroy but few lives, and the bills of the years when that diſeaſe alone prevailed, are remarkably low. It is often the immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſor of peſtilential diſeaſes in autumn; in which caſes, the bills of the year are very high.</p>

                  <head>SECTION X. Remarks on the preceding Hiſtory and Tables.</head>
                  <p>IMPERFECT as ancient hiſtory is, in regard to the accounts of diſeaſes, and the extraordinary phenomena of nature, we find that between the year B. C. 480 and the Chriſtian era, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of violent plagues occurred, moſt of which coincided in time with the following phenomena, comets, eruptions of vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canoes, earthquakes, drouth, ſevere winters, diſeaſes among cattle. Of thirteen comets mentioned in the foregoing hiſtory, which are all whoſe dates I am able to aſcertain, <hi>eight</hi> of them coincide with volcanic eruptions of Etna, the only volcano of any note, which the hiſtory of that period has recorded; and <hi>ele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> of them coincide in time with peſtilence. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſcarcity of our materials for a hiſtory of theſe phenomena, at that period, and make due allowances for the uncertainty of chronology, we ſhall find reaſon to be ſurpriſed at ſuch a number of theſe coincidences. In ſeveral inſtances we find extreme drouth and very ſevere winters to correſpond in time with comets and eruptions of Etna, conformable to facts in modern days.</p>
                  <p>On this ſubject, hiſtory is barren alſo for many centuries after the Chriſtian era. Yet in every period, even in the dark ages, we find numerous coincidences of the great phenomena above mentioned. All the great plagues that have afflicted mankind, have been accompanied with violent agitations of the elements.<note n="*" place="bottom">Modern philoſophy objects to the popular ſenſe in which the word, <hi>elements,</hi> is uſed; ſince it appears that what has uſually been conſidered as an <hi>element,</hi> is found by modern chymiſtry to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſubſtance, reſolvable into parts, in their nature and properties, diſtinct. Notwithſtanding th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe diſcoveries, I cannot conſent to diſcard the popular uſe of the word <hi>element.</hi> Nature preſents to the ſenſes of man, fire, earth, air and water, in a particular and predominant form. This is the form in which they appear to be moſt uſeful to man, and to be the conſtituent materials of other ſubſtances, as well as the agents in carrying on the great viſible operations of the ſyſtem. I therefore conſider the popular diſtribution as natural and convenient.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:036687_0366_100AA3801A2A9008"/>This obſervation reſts particularly on the events that preceded and attended the peſtilences of the following periods. A. D. 80—167—252—375—400—445—542—558—590—639— 679—682—745—762—802—905—994—1005—1031— 1044—1069—1106—1135—1142—1162—1181—1222— 1242—1300—1347—1368—1400—1477—1500—1531— 1577—1602—1625—1636—1665—1699—1709—1719— 1728—1743—1751—1760—1770—1783—1789. Many facts in other periods concur to prove the truth of the remark.</p>
                  <p>The phenomenon moſt generally and cloſely connected with peſtilence is an earthquake. From all the facts that I can find in hiſtory, I queſtion whether an inſtance of a conſiderable plague in any country, can be mentioned, which has not been immediately preceded or accompanied with convulſions of the earth. If any exceptions have occurred, they have eſcaped my reſearches. It does not happen that <hi>every place</hi> where peſtilence prevails, is ſhaken; but during the progreſs of the diſeaſes which I denominate <hi>peſtilence,</hi> and which run, in certain periods, over large portions of the globe, ſome parts of the earth, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which abound moſt with ſubterranean fire, are vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently agitated.</p>
                  <p>By adverting to the foregoing hiſtory, the reader will find that all thoſe years, in which conſiderable earthquakes have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in America, have been remarkably ſickly. Theſe years are 1638, 1647, 1658, 1662 and 3, 1668, 1727, 1755, 1783. See the hiſtory and the bills of mortality. Even the ſlighter ſhocks, have been attended with conſiderable ſickneſs, or have introduced a ſeries of epidemics, being cotemporary with the meaſles, influenza or ſore throat; as in 1669, 1720, 1737, 1757, 1761, 1769, 1771, 1791, 1797.</p>
                  <p>To enumerate the inſtances in Europe and Aſia, would be a uſeleſs repetition of the events related in the preceding hiſtory, to which the reader is referred.</p>
                  <p>Another phenomenon, which, next to earthquakes, appears
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036687_0367_100AA381A1932B48"/>
to be moſt cloſely connected with epidemic diſeaſes, is the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fire from volcanic mountains. In this article, hiſtory is deficient, or I have not been fortunate enough to find the works neceſſary to furniſh a complete view of theſe phenomena. There are whole centuries in which the books I have conſulted, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no eruption of Etna and Veſuvius. The account of erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Iceland, from the year 1000, taken from Pennant's Arctic Zoology, vol. 1. 331, is probably complete, or nearly ſo. Of the volcanoes in the Andes, we have very few accounts; as well as of thoſe in the Moluccas. Of thoſe in the Arctic regions of Aſia and America, we know very little.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding theſe defects, we are able, by the eruptions in Italy, Sicily and Iceland, to arrive to ſome very important concluſions. The reader muſt have noticed, in the preceding hiſtory, the coincidences in time between volcanic diſcharges, and winters of unuſual ſeverity. Theſe diſcharges either precede or follow the winter. Thus the eruptions of 1766, 1779 and 1783, were immediately followed by intenſely cold winters. The ſevere winters of 1762-3 and 1779-80, were ſpeedily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by eruptions. Theſe inſtances will ſerve as ſamples of the ordinary courſe of theſe events. Sometimes the eruptions continue or are repeated, for a number of years in ſucceſſion; but the eruptions when continued are moderate and the ſeaſons variable. When the volcanoes have been, for ſome years, quiet, and that ſuſpenſion is followed by a great diſcharge, it appears to me that ſevere winters invariably follow or precede the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, within a few months. So alſo when an eruption is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for a number of years, if at any time the diſcharge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes violent, a ſevere winter attends it; as in 1669. Etna was in a ſtate of eruption from 1664 to 1679; but in 1669, the diſcharge was immenſely augmented, and the winters next preceding and following, were very ſevere.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome years in which eruptions are noted, of which I find no account, reſpecting the ſeaſons. Perhaps ſome of theſe will, on further inveſtigation, be found to be exceptions.</p>
                  <p>It is to be obſerved that, in ſome caſes, a ſevere winter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to both hemiſpheres, ſometimes to one only, and in a few
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036687_0368_100AA384E63F36C8"/>
caſes, to a part of a hemiſphere only. Thus in 1607-8—1683-4 —1762<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>3—1766-7—1779-80—1783-4, the ſeverity extended to both hemiſpheres. In 1640-41—1739-40, and in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the ſevere winter in Europe preceded, by one year, a ſimilar winter in America. In a few inſtances, ſevere froſt takes place in one hemiſphere, during a ſeries of mild winters in the other; but this is leſs common. In general, the ſeverity hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, in both hemiſpheres at once, or in two winters in imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſucceſſion; and as far as evidence has yet appeared, this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity is cloſely attendant on volcanic diſcharges, with very few exceptions.</p>
                  <p>Another phenomenon which uſually coincides in time with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere winters, is the approach of comets. I have been ſtruck with ſurpriſe at the coincidences of this kind. There are a few inſtances on record of mild winters, during the appearance of theſe bodies; but in theſe caſes, the comets have appeared to be ſmall, or to paſs the ſyſtem at an immenſe diſtance from the earth. The large comets and thoſe which approach near to the earth, <hi>ſeem</hi> to produce almoſt uniformly great heat, exceſſive drouth, followed by very cold winters, tremendous ſtorms of wind, rain, ſnow and hail, unuſual tides or ſwell of the ocean, and uſually, volcanic eruptions. How far theſe phenomena are connected, as cauſe and effect, future obſervations may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin. Some of them occur ſo uniformly in the ſame year, that I cannot reſiſt the evidence of their connection.</p>
                  <p>After a volcano has been many years quiet, its diſcharges are, I believe, always preceded by extreme drouth; and this defect of water is not only obſervable in the vicinity of the volcano, but often extends over a whole continent, if not over the world. Many inſtances have been related; it is ſufficient here to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the exceſſive drouth in 1762 and 1782, preceding eruptions of Etna and Heckla. In theſe years, almoſt all ſprings were exhauſted over a great portion of America.</p>
                  <p>Cold winters ſometimes follow wet ſeaſons, but more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a very hot ſummer or very dry autumn. Sometimes two or three ſevere winters occur in ſucceſſion, as in 1766, 67 and 68 —and in America from 1796 to 1799.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="unknown:036687_0369_100AA387EBC26098"/>The years when comets approach, or volcanoes diſcharge fire, and when the atmoſphere exhibits fiery appearances, as meteors, ſtreams of light, and mock ſuns, are, beyond compariſon, the moſt tempeſtuous. Witneſs the years 1766, 1771 and 72, 1780, 1783, 4 and 5, 1788, 1797. In ſuch years, the riſk on veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels at ſea, is greatly increaſed.</p>
                  <p>As dry ſeaſons uſually precede volcanic eruptions, ſo very wet ſeaſons often follow them. This ſeems not to be the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable courſe of events; but there are remarkable inſtances of deluging rains after theſe diſcharges. Witneſs the ſeaſons follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the univerſal convulſions of the earth in 1692 and 3, and 1766. Thus, the electricity is re-conducted to the earth.</p>
                  <p>In every caſe, I believe this remark will be found t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar courſe of the ſeaſons. The heat of ſummer and the cold of winter are in extremes; more ſnow is generated in winter, and more hail in ſummer; tempeſts are more violent and frequent; meteors more numerous, and rain more unequally diſtributed over the earth.</p>
                  <p>A ſeries of epidemic diſeaſes, meaſles, influenza, affections of the throat, followed by peſtilential fevers, appear generally to commence and take their departure, from ſome of the great agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the elements above recited. This at leaſt has been the caſe in America in the four laſt periods, beginning with 1756-7, 1769 and 70, 1782 and 3, 1788 and 9. This fact will want no authority but a bare inſpection of the preceding hiſtory, and tables.</p>
                  <p>The continuance and the varieties of the diſeaſes ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on ſimilar diſturbances in the elements; and as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges and motions of the electrical fluid depend on no certain laws that are known, they are irregular, and may contribute to vary the order, and the nature of diſeaſes. In ſome caſes, there has been a continued ſeries of epidemics, for twenty years, in which the common order is not exactly obſerved; but this is not frequent. A remarkable inſtance occurred between 1727 and 1744.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe periods in general have been moſt diſtinguiſhed for

ſickneſs over the world, in which the fire of the earth has exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited the moſt numerous and violent effects. Witneſs the period from 1631 to 1637, when the three moſt noted volcanoes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged immenſe quantities of fire and lava; and ſevere peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence extended over all Europe and America. A ſimilar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark may be made concerning the period of the laſt univerſal peſtilence in Europe from 1663 to 1666—alſo from 1691 to 1695—from 1727 to 30—1759 to 1764—1769 to 1772—1774 to 1777—1783 to 1786—and concerning ſome ſhorter periods, all of which produced epidemics in both hemiſpheres.</p>
                  <p>Slighter eruptions and earthquakes, which are almoſt annual, ſeem to have leſs effect. The fire of the globe is in perpetual motion or action, and to this great agent, philoſophers are agreed, are to be aſcribed the changes of ſeaſons, and the generation of rain, hail and ſnow. Its operations however are not all of them viſible, nor even perceptible, until they appear by their effects. It is probable that the <hi>inviſible</hi> operations of the electrical fluid produce more effects than thoſe which are ſeen. Indeed, we may queſtion whether moſt of the viſible phenomena of that principle, are not mere <hi>effects</hi> of that action which influences the vegetable and animal world. It is probable to me that neither ſeaſons, earthquakes, nor volcanic eruptions, are the cauſes of the principal derangements we behold in animal and vegetable life, but are themſelves the <hi>effects</hi> of thoſe motions and inviſible operations which affect mankind. Hence catarrh and other epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics often appear, <hi>before</hi> the viſible phenomena of eruptions and earthquakes.</p>
                  <p>P. S. After this work was prepared for the preſs, I was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored by Dr. Mitchill, with ſome extracts from a paper of Mr. Holm, a Swede, on the ſubject of a volcanic eruption in Ice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in 1783, by which it appears that the atmoſphere is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered peſtilential by diſcharges of fire and lava from the earth. This effect is ſuppoſed to be wrought by a combination of the ſeptous and oxygenous parts, and may confirm and improve Dr. Mitchill's theory of peſtilential air.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Had this treatiſe fallen into my hands ſome months ago, I might have been able to illuſtrate particular parts of my theory by authentic facts, taken from that work. As it is, I muſt content myſelf with obſerving, that Mr. Holm's obſervations verify my ideas, reſpecting the agency of electricity in producing peſtilence, and extremes in the ſeaſons. On this theory not only peſtilence, but ſevere cold, and extreme heat, hail and ſnow are all familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained, and their connection with volcanic eruptions, and other electrical operations, viſible and inviſible, demonſtrated.</p>

                  <p>It is probable the mortality in the northern ſtates of America was every where in that proportion. The ſame diſeaſe made ſimilar ravages between 1749 and 1753—in 1759—1765 and 6 —in ſome places in 1769.—It was remarkably mortal in 1773. This latter year was in America unhealthy. In Salem, Maſſ. the bill of 1773, was raiſed to 208, (double the uſual amount) by the dyſentery. The bill for St. Peterſburgh in Ruſſia, was ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in 1773, one fifth, and in 1777, one fourth.</p>
                  <p>The laſt epidemic period, ſave one, was from 1781 to 1787 incluſive. The diſeaſes were influenza, meaſles and ſcarlatina. Theſe were in general lighter than uſual. In the interior of New-York ſtate, Vermont Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, the ſcarlatina was more ſevere and mortal; but on the ſea board and eſpecially in Connecticut, it was milder, and many places wholly eſcaped it. Yet every where the bills of mortality were ſwelled in 1783, 4, 5 or 6, when the plague was raging in the Levant and Egypt. This period was cloſed by remarkably cool ſummers, and no dyſentery or peſtilential fever of any conſiderable violence or extent, ſucceeded.</p>

                  <p>The ſcarlatina and meaſles produced their principal effects, it will be obſerved, in Philadelphia and Boſton. The plague raged in Egypt principally in 1783 and 4, and the ſcarlatina appeared in Britain, but without very conſiderable mortality. In 1787 the plague prevailed in Egypt and on the Barbary coaſt; and diſeaſes of the throat were prevalent in England and ſome parts of America.</p>

                  <p>Let it be noted that the effect of the ſcarlatina was here in 1795 and '96. The progreſs of the diſeaſe is diſtinctly marked to be from New-York eaſtward, from 1793 to 1796. The ſcarlatina in 1785 and 6, was moſt ſevere in Maſſachuſetts—that in 1794, in Connecticut. The bills in Boſton for 1792 were ſwelled by the ſmall-pox by inoculation, which is not to be taken into this account of epidemics. The year ſelected was rather unfavorable, as the condition of the atmoſphere was inflammatory, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to produce eruptive complaints. The ſcarlatina was then making its appearance in the middle ſtates. The ſpring of 1793, when inoculation was begun at Hartford, was ſtill more unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable; and the ſmall-pox was ſo unmanageable as to ſurpriſe the faculty. The principles unfolded in this treatiſe will ſolve the difficulty.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. We obſerve an order and progreſſion in the epidemics, which is in a degree uniform. Periods of peſtilence, with ſome exceptions, ſeem to be introduced by meaſles and influenza; then follow diſeaſes of the throat, or anginas; laſtly peſtilential fevers. During the whole period, the meaſles, influenza and angina, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally appear in ſpring, autumn and winter; and rarely, if ever, does a peſtilential fever, as plague and yellow fever, occur in a particular city or country, without influenza, angina, meaſles or inflammatory fevers in the ſpring preceding, for immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſors. This is true in the tropical climates, in caſes of epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics; and ſo uniform has been the fact in the temperate latitudes, that I am nearly prepared to ſay, that if none of thoſe precurſors appear in winter and ſpring, no peſtilential fever will be epidemic in the following ſummer and autumn, unleſs the dyſentery may be excepted. It holds true in every caſe of <hi>great</hi> peſtilence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The progreſſiveneſs in the peſtilential principle is obvious in the augmented bills of mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ality, which immediately precede the plague. This ariſes from the number and violence of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant diſeaſes which always precede an epidemic peſtilence. This augmentation is viſible ſome times two years before the plague appears, and almoſt always in the ſpring months preceding. See the London bills in the years preceding the plague in 1625 —1636—1665 The ſame is obſervable in other bills, both in Europe and America. In a few inſtances, the bill of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding year is low; but in this caſe, ſome other epidemic has uſually gone before, and finiſhed its courſe; or the plague is preceded by influenza only, which does not ſwell the bill of mortality.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes a ſeries of epidemics falls with more violence on one hemiſphere than on the other; but perhaps in no inſtance has a courſe of diſeaſes ſpread over one continent, without ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves on the other. I have not been able to find an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in which the plague has made great ravages in the eaſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when the American continent has been more or leſs affected by the epidemics above mentioned; and in ſome inſtances it is proved that the violence of the ſore-throat, influenza, meaſles or

yellow fever, in America, has correſponded with the violence of peſtilence in Egypt and the Levant. The commencement of each period of epidemics is nearly cotemporary, in both hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheres.<note n="*" place="bottom">It ſometimes happens that peſtilence occurs in Conſtantinople, Smyrna or Cairo, when it is not epidemic beyond thoſe cities; owing to peculiar ſeaſons and local cauſes. But it never ſpreads to Syria, the iſlands of the Archipelago, and other neighboring countries, except when epidemic diſeaſes ſpread over the world. At leaſt I have not found an inſtance.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the great plague in Conſtantinople was cotemporary with the fatal angina and dyſentery in America in 1751—alſo in 1755. Cotemporary with the meaſles in America in 1758 and 9, was the commencement of the extenſive Levant plague of 1760. Peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence in Perſia was cotemporary with the epidemics of 1773— In 1783 commenced plague in the eaſt and epidemics in America —the ſame in 1792 and 3. Diſeaſes of the throat in almoſt every inſtance prevail at the ſame time in Europe and America.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In two periods within half a century, a ſevere angina and dyſentery have been epidemic together and once for a ſeries of years, as in 1751, and from 1773 to 1777. This is an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the uſual order, and other deviations ſometimes occur.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As catarrh precedes, ſo it follows every ſevere epidemic peſtilence, and the perſons who have been affected with a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential fever in ſummer, are moſt apt to be affected by catarrh at the commencement of cold weather.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. After ſevere peſtilential fevers in ſummer, the inflammatory fevers of winter, wear the livery of the ſummer fevers. They generally carry with them bilious diſcharges, and a yellow ſkin. They have alſo this remarkable character, that they ſpeedily run through the inflammatory diatheſis, and become typhus. They are the <hi>peſtilence of winter</hi>; and ſometimes appear <hi>before</hi> the peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence of ſummer. This fact alone decides the queſtion, that peſtilential fevers of ſummer are generated on the ſpot where they exiſt; and derive their malignant and infectious quality ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ſtate of the elements.</p>
                  <p>This ſpecies of inflammatory fever has occurred in many caſes during the winter months, ſince the year 1790. In ſome caſes it has extinguiſhed three four and five members of a family; as

in Hartford and New-Haven. But it is a moſt conſoling reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is leſs frequent than formerly in this country. It has not been epidemic in the northern ſtates ſince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>61, as far as I can learn. Formerly it was as frightful a calamity as the yellow fever is in this age. In the foregoing hiſtory, many examples have been mentioned—as at Fairfield in 1698—at Waterbury in 1713—at Hartford and Duck Creek in 1720—at Farmington in 1729—at Bethlem, Hartford, Eaſt-Haven and New-Haven in 1761—at Holliſton in 1753, &amp;c. Whether the diſappear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this diſeaſe is owing to the clearing of the country, by which the quantity of debilitating miàſmata of ſummer has been diminiſhed, or whether it is the conſequence of other alterations in our climate, is not eaſily determined.</p>
                  <p>The diſappearance of the Long Fever, ſo called, is another moſt conſoling circumſtance. This ſpecies of typhus fever was formerly one of the moſt terrible diſeaſes of our climate. At preſent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> is a rare occurrence.</p>
                  <p>On the whole, we have very clear proof that the <hi>quantity of diſeaſe</hi> in this country, has been diminiſhed, within half a century. The yellow fever, that is, the peſtilential fever of ſummer and autumn, was formerly as frequent and as malignant as in this age; while the inflammatory fevers of winter, and the long fever, have almoſt diſappeared as epidemics. The intermittents and remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of autumn, are greatly decreaſed in the northern ſtates; and the dyſentery has not increaſed in frequency or virulence. Anginas have never been ſo fatal as they were between 1735 and 1743.</p>
                  <p>It is probable that ſome of theſe changes in the character of diſeaſes may be aſcribed to alterations in our climate, or modes of living—and therefore may be permanent. In ſome caſes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in medical ſcience and the practice of phyſic may have diſarmed diſeaſes of their terrors. But it is poſſible that ſome of the changes mentioned are only revolutions in diſeaſe, occaſioned by temporary cauſes, and that the ſame diſorders may, in future periods, recur, with the whole train of formidable ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>

                     <hi>Note.</hi>—It has been obſerved that the <hi>long fever,</hi> ſo called, has nearly diſappeared from our climate. On further enquiry, it appears that this obſervation muſt be reſtricted to the maritime ſtates. The bilious remitting fever that prevailed in Vermont and New-Hampſhire in 1798, and which has re-appeared in this ſummer (1799) is of that ſpecies. See Medical Repoſitory, vol. 3. 5. In the <hi>interior</hi> of our country, this is a new diſeaſe; while on the ſea-coaſt it has become extinct. Shall we conclude from theſe facts, that the diſeaſe follows or ſprings from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtate of cultivation? In the interior, where the diſeaſe is now prevalent, the clearing and cultivation of the country were begun about 30 years ago. On the ſea-coaſt, where the diſeaſe has diſappeared, the country has been ſettled 150 years, and is generally under cultivation.</p>

                  <p>The accounts of the ſeaſons are moſtly from Engliſh writers, and refer to England, with ſome exceptions. In regard to heat and cold, the ſeaſons are generally uniform in moſt countries, on the ſame continent; but not in regard to drouth and moiſture.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe forty-four inſtances of influenza, it may be obſerved, from the preceding hiſtory.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="33" facs="unknown:036687_0388_100AA3B49FE44A98"/>1. That moſt of them happened, after or during ſevere cold, or during moiſt weather, and in ſpring, winter or autumn. Some however, occurred in dry hot ſeaſons, and others in mild winters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nineteen inſtances occurred in years when there was a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canic eruption in Italy or Iceland, and eleven others, though in different years, were within a few months of eruptions; making 30 out of the 44. Two or three others happened near the time of volcanic diſcharges in South-America.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Almoſt all happened in years of earthquakes, or within a few months preceding or following them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thirty inſtances occurred within the year, or a few months preceding or following the appearance of comets.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be obſerved that ſome of theſe epidemics have been limited to the American hemiſphere, at the diſtance of three, four or five years from an epidemic of the ſame kind in Europe. Such as thoſe of 1647—1655—which coincide in time with violent earthquakes in South-America.</p>
                  <p>In other inſtances this diſeaſe ſpread over the whole globe; uſually beginning in America: That is, in the inſtances of which I can obtain any correct information. Thus in four inſtances, viz. in 1698, 1757, 1761 and 1781, it ſpread over the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can hemiſphere one year prior to its pervading the other hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere. And the univerſal catarrh of 1733, which encircled the globe, commenced in America two months before it appeared in Europe. The epidemic of 1782 invaded Europe from the ſide of Aſia, the year after it appeared in America. In 1788, the influenza in Europe <hi>preceded</hi> the ſame diſeaſe in America.</p>
                  <p>I regret my want of materials to complete a view of this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. No regular regiſter has been kept in America, of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, diſeaſes and phenomena, from the firſt ſettlement, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any notices of all the catarrhs in this country, are in exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, I do not know. I have found no account of any, between 1655 and 1698—nor between the latter year and 1733. One of theſe inſtances, that in 1698, came to my knowledge by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as I have mentioned under that year, in the foregoing hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. From the uniform appearance of this epidemic as often as
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036687_0389_100AA3B255B39290"/>
once in ten or twelve years, in other periods, we have ground to believe, it has always occurred in nearly the ſame periods.</p>
                  <p>This epidemic is evidently the effect of ſome inſenſible qualities of the atmoſphere; as it ſpreads with aſtoniſhing rapidity over land and ſea, uncontrolled by heat or cold, drouth or moiſture. From theſe circumſtances and its near coincidence in time with the violent action of fire in earthquakes and volcanoes, there is reaſon to conclude the diſeaſe to be the effect of ſome acceſs of ſtimulant powers to the atmoſphere by means of the electrical principle. No other principle in creation, which has yet come under the cognizance of the human mind, ſeems adequate to the ſame effects. I do not conſider earthquakes and volcanic erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as the <hi>cauſes</hi> of this epidemic, but as effects of the common cauſe and evidences of its exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>The courſes of this epidemic are very various. That in 1510 proceeded from Africa to Sicily, Italy and the north of Europe. This diſeaſe could not be the effect of the eruption in Iceland; for it appeared firſt in ſouthern latitudes. If there was a volcanic diſcharge about that time in Africa, we might be inclined to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the diſeaſe to that cauſe; but it is more probable that it is to be aſcribed to an inſenſible action of atmoſpheric fire,<note n="*" place="bottom">I uſe this word to expreſs the principle manifeſted in electrical operations, although this is uſually ſuppoſed to be a cold fuſion. Of the nature of this principle, we know little. We ſee only its effects.</note> which is more general and violent, about the time of eruptions; and which fire is probably agitated in all parts of the globe, although it produces viſible effects in exploſions, in ſome particular places only. I think no man can queſtion the fact, after reading the preceding hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The courſe of the epidemic in 1551, I am not able to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; nor that in 1557. This invaded Spain in Auguſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſevere catarrh of 1580 began in the ſouth of Europe, in the heat of ſummer, and proceeded to the north. The ſeaſon in general was temperate.</p>
                  <p>From that year to 1708—9, I find no account of the courſe of the epidemic catarrh; but that in 1708—9, began in the north of Europe and proceeded to the ſouth.</p>
                  <p>The epidemic of 1729—30, proceeded from Poland and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſia,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036687_0390_100AA3B71FEC12C8"/>
to the weſt and ſouth, and ended about the time of an explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from Veſuvius.</p>
                  <p>The univerſal influenza of 1733, began in America in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn of 1732. It appeared in Europe in December. That of 1788 appeared in April, May, June and Auguſt, in different places.</p>
                  <p>The epidemic in America in 1789, began in the middle ſtates, and ſpread ſouthward and eaſtward. In 1790, it began in about the ſame longitude, but in the interior country, and ſpread eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſouthward.</p>
                  <p>The influenza of 1782 in Europe, came from Aſia. Poſſibly it might have travelled from America, acroſs the Pacific to Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na and Kamſchatka; as it was epidemic in America in 1781.</p>
                  <p>This is all I am able to diſcover of the origin and direction of this ſingular epidemic. It is greatly to be deſired, that we might learn preciſely the dates of its appearance, the place, the direction of its progreſs, in all caſes, and compare theſe circumſtances with the extraordinary agitations of the elements, which occur about the ſame time. But for this purpoſe my materials are incomplete.</p>
                  <p>It is obſervable, however, that the influenza is cloſely allied to the meaſles. Sometimes the ſymptoms are combined in the ſame attack, and rarely does one diſeaſe become epidemic, except juſt before or after the other. This proves their alliance: indeed I conſider them as different modifications of the ſame epidemic.</p>
                  <p>Catarrh is alſo cloſely connected with peſtilential fevers, and ſometimes this is true of the meaſles. It is rare indeed that epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic plague and yellow fever do not begin and end in catarrhal affections—that is, catarrh precedes in ſpring, and follows in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn. Sometimes peſtilence is preceded and followed by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles and angina.</p>
                  <p>Every epidemic conſtitution ſeems to commence with meaſles or influenza. To theſe ſucceed angina, in ſome of its various forms, which are all the offspring of the ſame parent. Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low peſtilential fevers, in the form of dyſentery, yellow fever and plague. Whenever the epidemic conſtitution is manifeſted by meaſles, influenza and affections of the throat, common diſeaſes,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:036687_0391_100AA3B947883CE8"/>
even in places apparently healthy, become more malignant, and ſporadic caſes of peſtilential fever occur in almoſt every ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe facts are curious, and without attending to them, the philoſophy of epidemics cannot be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>P. S. After writing the foregoing hiſtory, I was able to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain further particulars of a ſevere influenza in America in 1737. Warren, on the yellow fever, mentions this catarrh in Barbadoes in the winter preceding the bilious plague in that iſland in 1738. I have now learnt from two elderly gentlemen, who were then arrived to adult years, that in November 1737, this epidemic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded all parts of the country, ſo ſuddenly and ſeverely that neighbors could not viſit each other, and that there were ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people in health to perform the ordinary domeſtic labors neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſupport life.</p>
                  <p>If my informants are correct as to the time, this epidemic inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Europe and America in the <hi>ſame month</hi>—the only inſtance that I have found; and an exception to the foregoing remarks. It will be obſerved alſo that this inſtance coincides with an erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Veſuvius, and the moſt tremendous tempeſt in the Eaſt-Indies ever known. Let it be noted alſo, that this catarrh was the <hi>immediate precurſor</hi> of the moſt fatal peſtilential fever in the Weſt-Indies, and one that nearly depopulated Mexico. The catarrh commenced with or a little before a moſt ſevere winter.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable that the extent and violence of this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mark exactly the ſeverity of the peſtilential fevers which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede and follow it. The two epidemic catarrhs of 1733 and 37, invaded the whole globe in the ſame year. They were very ſevere, and ſo were the anginas and plagues of this period; far beyond what has occurred at any other time, during this centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, until the laſt period.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XIII. Of the order, connection and progreſſion of peſtilential epidemics.</head>
                  <p>IN the early periods of the world, little notice appears to have been taken of a connection between epidemic diſeaſes; nor have modern writers ſupplied this defect in the hiſtory of medicin. Hippocrates and Sydenham ſeem to have been aware of ſuch a connection, and the latter author has laid broad and firm foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a complete ſyſtem of truth, on the ſubject of epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics. His obſervations were confined to the city of London. Had he extended his view to all parts of Europe, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized his obſervations, he would have found a multitude of facts to juſtify his theory, and probably would have raiſed it above the reach of that obloquy and ridicule, which ſucceeding profeſſors of phyſic, of leſs genius and learning, have c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t on his occult qualities of air.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, it is ſurpriſing that medical men have not purſued the ideas ſuggeſted by theſe great fathers of their ſcience. Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates led the way, unlocking the great doctrin of a conſtitution or ſtate of the atmoſphere, calculated to produce particular epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic diſeaſes; a doctrin which Sydenham has purſued with wonderful ſucceſs. Any man who reads the hiſtory of diſeaſes, muſt ſee that certain ſpecies of them appear nearly together in time and place. The order in which they appear, may not be exactly the ſame at all times, and in all countries; but they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur ſo nearly together, as evidently to prove their alliance, and their dependence on the ſame general cauſes.</p>
                  <p>All popular diſeaſes muſt have, for their cauſes, ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as extenſive as the effects. Theſe cauſes moſt probably exiſt in the elements, fire, air and water; for we know of no other medium by which diſeaſes can be communicated to whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities of people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="unknown:036687_0393_100AA3BE16D17DE0"/>Bad food indeed is a fruitful ſource of diſeaſes; but this muſt always proceed from the qualities of the elements which enter into its compoſition. A defect therefore in the nouriſhing powers of food, is a conſequence of a defect or ſuperabundance in the elements, or in their combination in animal and vegetable produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It may be conſidered as a diſeaſe in the animal and veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etable kingdom, which moſt probably proceeds from the ſame cauſes, as epidemic diſtempers among mankind.</p>
                  <p>The principal epidemic diſtempers which invade mankind, are, catarrh or influenza, meaſles, whooping or chin cough, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies of angina, ſmall pox, bilious fevers, petechial fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, dyſentery, plague. Of theſe, catarrh is the moſt decided<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an epidemic dependent wholly on a particular ſtate of atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere. Cullen calls it "catarrh from contagion," to diſtinguiſh it from ſporadic caſes of the ſame diſeaſe; but, after careful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, during the progreſs of it in the United States in 1789, and again in 1790, I am confident the progreſs of the diſeaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends very little on a communication from perſon to perſon. It has been doubted whether it is an infectious diſeaſe; and I have ſome evidence to prove it not ſo; but certain it is, that its ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den invaſion of whole families, whole towns and even whole countries, and the rapidity of its progreſs over ſea and land, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely preclude the ſuppoſition of its dependence on ſpecific contagion.</p>
                  <p>The other diſeaſes above enumerated may ariſe from both cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes—infection and a peculiar ſtate of air. Some of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend moſtly on a conſtitution of air, fitted to produce them; others are ſeldom produced without a connection with diſeaſed perſons. It is however proper to obſerve that the ſmall-pox, dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entery and plague are not uſually, and in ſtrictneſs of language, <hi>epidemic</hi> diſeaſes. They ſeldom invade whole countries. They are more properly <hi>endemic;</hi> yet this epithet is not ſtrictly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to them; being uſed more properly to denote a diſeaſe which is <hi>peculiar</hi> to a particular place, whereas thoſe diſeaſes may invade any place on the globe. The elephantioſis is an <hi>endemic</hi> in Egypt and certain other places in warm climates; the ſmall-pox, dyſentery and plague uſually appear in cities, camps, or
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:036687_0394_100AA3C0B9CFF128"/>
other unhealthy ſituations, without affecting neighboring places, which contain not the ſame local cauſes of diſeaſe. They might therefore, in ſtrict propriety, be denominated <hi>temporary endemics,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>epidemics</hi> which ſpread to all places alike; and to <hi>endemics,</hi> which <hi>conſtantly</hi> or <hi>uſually</hi> appear in particular parts of the world.</p>
                  <p>This diſtinction however is not very material; and I ſhall therefore ſpeak of the ſmall-pox, dyſentery and plague, as epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic diſeaſes; meaning by this epithet, that they, at certain times, ſpread generally over a particular town or region.</p>
                  <p>The nature and kinds of contagion will be more particularly conſidered, in a ſubſequent ſection; the preſent ſubject, is, the order, connection, and progreſſion obſervable in peſtilential epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics.</p>
                  <p>The influence of a certain ſtate of air in generating epidemics was obſerved by Hippocrates, who has deſcribed the prevalent diſeaſes, in different ſeaſons. In his ſecond ſection on epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics, he deſcribes what he calls "Kataſtaſis loimodes," a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential ſtate of the air or ſeaſons. He does not indeed in this paſſage mention the <hi>plague,</hi> but he ſpeaks of thoſe malignant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which are, in modern times, the precurſors of the plague, and which are now produced by the ſtate of weather which he deſcribes.</p>
                  <p>This ſtate of the ſeaſons he repreſents thus, "The year was auſtrinus, remarkable for ſoutherly breezes, rainy and without winds. The firſt part of the year dry, and autumn rainy, with ſoutherly winds, humid and cloudy. In winter, ſoutherly winds, moiſt and mild weather. About the vernal equinox, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere cold, but the north winds, with ſnow, were of no long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Spring was again calm, ſoutherly weather—great rains continued till Auguſt—then clear hot weather—the cool Eleſian winds blew but little and for ſhort periods. A rainy autumn, with north winds."</p>
                  <p>The ſoutherly, hot, humid air here deſcribed, whenever of long continuance in ſummer, proves the cauſe of numerous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant diſeaſes, in the United States, as well as in Europe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho not certainly productive of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="unknown:036687_0395_100AA3C32667FC48"/>Hippocrates proceeds to mention the diſeaſes which prevailed in this ſtate of ſeaſons. "Before ſpring, even during the cold weather, appeared many eryſipelous diſeaſes of a malignant type. Diſeaſes of the fauces, accompanied with hourſeneſs, ardent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, with phrenitis; ulcers in the mouth; inflammation of eyes, carbuncles, &amp;c. Theſe diſeaſes ſpread and became epidemic and mortal." The author then proceeds to deſcribe the eryſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pelas and other diſeaſes here named. Theſe caſes differ from the plague in Athens; and prove that the peſtilence in Thaſus, where he wrote, was of milder ſymptoms, though probably cotemporary with that epidemic in Athens.</p>
                  <p>My particular reaſon for reciting theſe paſſages from Hippoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, is, to prove a progreſſiveneſs in a peſtilential ſtate of air, and the diſeaſes which it produces. The diſeaſes here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are the ſame, ſubſtantially, as thoſe which <hi>precede</hi> the plague in modern times, in the countries bordering on the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean, and with little variation, the ſame with thoſe which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the plague in all parts of the world. Eryſipelous, or other eruptive diſeaſes, catarrhous affections, or ardent fevers, are the conſtant precurſors of the plague, wherever it appears. Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates does not mention any fatal plague, in the ſtate of air deſcribed; and it often happens, at this day, that the ſtrength of the peſtilential principle is arreſted in its progreſs, and the ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idemics are limited, in their violence, to diſeaſes of a type leſs malignant than the true plague, or ariſing to the plague only in a few ſcattering caſes. But whatever may be the degree of the peſtilential ſtate of the air, or at whatever point, it may be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tined to ceaſe, and yield to a more ſalubrious conſtitution, the claſs of diſeaſes which mark its riſe and progreſs, are always ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, or the ſame, modified only in the violence of their ſymptoms, by accidental circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>A careful attention to theſe facts, cannot fail to convince the obſerver of the juſtneſs of Sydenham's doctrines, in regard to conſtitutions of air; and the facts themſelves demoliſh, at one ſtroke, all the common medical doctrines of the communication of peſtilence from place to place by contagion, or fomites.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, the hiſtories of ancient plagues furniſh but
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036687_0396_100AA3C5E5578A30"/>
little light on this ſubject; yet the barren annals of antiquity and the middle ages, are not wholly deſtitute of evidence to this point. The progreſſion of the plague in Rome, growing more general and fatal to the ſecond and third year, is a fact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by Livy, and is related in the preceding pages.</p>
                  <p>The remark of Dion Caſſius, that the aſhes from Veſuvius, in the great eruption of 79, produced, that year, only ſlight diſeaſes, but the next year, an epidemic, has already been no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed. It leaves no room to queſtion, that the deſtructive plague of the year 80, was preceded by epidemic diſorders of a leſs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant type.</p>
                  <p>The middle ages furniſh facts in confirmation of this doctrin. Witneſs the great plague in 1112, which was preceded by ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipelous diſeaſes in England in 1109, and great mortality in 1111. The plague of 1242, which was preceded by great mortality in 12<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0—the ſame fact is obſervable in the peſtilence of 1252, 1368, 1379, 1390, 1517, 1527, 1575, 1636—and in many other inſtances.</p>
                  <p>This fact did not eſcape the notice of that accurate obſerver of nature, Lord Bacon, who lived at a period when the plague frequently infeſted England. He ſays, "The leſſer infections of the ſmall-pox, purple fever, agues, &amp;c. in the preceding ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and hovering all the winter, <hi>portend a great peſtilence the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſummer,</hi> for putrefaction riſes not to its height at once." Works, vol. 3, p. 59.</p>
                  <p>That ſtate of air which produces peſtilential diſeaſes, Lord Bacon denominates <hi>putrefaction;</hi> but whatever appellation we may give to the <hi>cauſe</hi> of peſtilence, the remark is demonſtrably well founded, that this "riſes not to its height at once." It is progreſſive; producing firſt the "leſſer infections." The plague is rarely, if ever, an original, diſtinct, iſolated diſeaſe; but the laſt or moſt mortal form of a ſeries of malignant diſtempers. The <hi>purple</hi> fever mentioned by Lord Bacon is nearly allied to the <hi>petechial</hi> fever, which is the uſual precurſor of peſtilence in the Levant.</p>
                  <p>The univerſal plague of 1635, 6 and 7, was preceded by the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036687_0397_100AA3C78DC9FBC8"/>
uſual diſeaſes, and the progreſs of them is diſtinctly traced by the learned Diemerbroeck. He remarks, chap. 3 de peſte, that "the ſpring of 1635, was warm and moderately humid, to which ſucceeded a very hot, dry ſeaſon, in which appeared many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant epidemics. In the firſt place, a ſevere plague broke out at Leyden, and deſtroyed more than 20,000 lives. At Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meguen, in Gueldres and other regions, a certain peſtilent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpread with dreadful mortality. In autumn, the ſevere heat ſtill continuing with exceſſive drouth, many other malignant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes appeared, as ſmall-pox, meaſles, diarrhea and dyſentery of a very bad type; but above all, the above mentioned peſtilential purple fever, called in Italy <hi>petechial,</hi> increaſed daily in extent and violence, <hi>until it turned into the true plague</hi>—"donec tandem in apertiſſimam peſtem tranſiret."—The author goes on to remark that from November through the winter, ſcattering caſes of plague occurred in Nimeguen. In January 1636, it increaſed, and in March ſpread and became epidemic—roſe to its height in April, and continued till October. See pages 5 and 6.</p>
                  <p>This paſſage contains a number of important facts. Firſt—the ſeaſons were inſalubrious. Secondly—the peſtilential ſtate of air extended to many places at the ſame time: In another page, the author ſays the peſtilence ſpread over almoſt all Germany and the low countries. Thrdly—this ſtate of air was of different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of malignity or violence, in different places at the ſame time. Thus, the plague appeared at Leyden early in 1635, but cotemporary with this, was the appearance of the purple fever in Nimeguen and in other places; and during the ſummer and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, this and other epidemics continued to rage with great mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and at laſt, the ſtrength of the peſtilential principle increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the fever changed its form, and appeared in the true plague.</p>
                  <p>Now, the modern way of accounting for the plague in Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen, would be to <hi>allege</hi> or <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> ſome infected goods to have conveyed the contagion from Leyden, where it firſt appeared; and then to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> the infection to be carried to Leyden from the Levant.</p>
                  <p>The philoſophic Diemerbroeck, who was preſent and obſerved all the circumſtances, <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> nothing. He relates plain facts
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036687_0398_100AA3CA4F408698"/>
juſt as they occurred, and admits that the plague muſt have ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginated in the country.</p>
                  <p>By conſidering the malignant epidemics that prevailed at that time, as connected and depending on the ſame general cauſe, we ſolve all the difficulties attending the origin of the plague. The petechial fever, which appeared at Nimeguen and other places, in 1635, was <hi>one of the forms</hi> in which the general contagion of the period, exhibited its effects on the human conſtitution. It was a <hi>part</hi> of the peſtilence—it could not be conveyed from Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, for it appeared in moſt parts of the low countries and in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, at the ſame time. The ſame general cauſe, an indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the elements to ſupport healthy life, produced various peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential diſeaſes, according to place, ſeaſon, age, habit of body and conſtitution, until its ſtrength and violence aroſe to their height, and gradually introduced the worſt form of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>The idea of Diemerbroeck, that the purple fever "turned to the plague," muſt give great offence to the followers of Mead and Cullen, the advocates for the doctrin of the propagation of the plague ſolely by ſpecific contagion. It oppoſes efficaciouſly their whole theory, and levels it with the earth.</p>
                  <p>The fact is however indiſputable. In the diſtreſſing period from 1569 to 1577, when Europe was almoſt depopulated by the ſpotted fever, phyſicians obſerved that this diſeaſe frequently turned into the plague, and the plague into the ſpotted fever. The ſame fact was often noticed by writers of the 16th and 17th cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, in which the plague frequently overran Europe.—Theſe two diſeaſes, are therefore two diſtinct forms or modifications of peſtilence—probably bearing an affinity to each other, like that between the diſtinct and confluent ſmall-pox. This fact ſhows that the diſtinction made by medical writers, between <hi>peſtis</hi> and <hi>peſtilentia,</hi> the plague and other peſtilential diſtempers, however uſeful in practice, is not authorized by truth and philoſophy. The ancients claſſed all contagious epidemics together, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated them <hi>peſtilence;</hi> and this diſtribution, in regard to their cauſes and origin, was doubtleſs moſt philoſophical. The diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution made by modern phyſicians, ſeems to have ariſen out of differences of ſymptoms, and to be beſt adapted to practice. At
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036687_0399_100AA3CD70EFFFF8"/>
the ſame time, it has probably been the occaſion of the common error of conſidering different ſpecies or forms of peſtilence, as diſeaſes of generical difference, and proceeding wholly from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct cauſes, when in fact they all have <hi>one general cauſe</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and the varieties of their ſymptoms proceed from <hi>diſtinct lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> and <hi>temporary cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On this ſubject the learned Riverius, in his Praxeos Medicae, lib. 17. has many judicious remarks. He obſerves, "That authors, who wrote on fevers, diſtinguiſh a peſtilent from a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever—by peſtilent fever they underſtand the true plague; by a malignant one, the fever vulgarly called <hi>purple,</hi> or other fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which tho epidemic and contagious, is leſs dangerous, and in which more patients ſurvive than periſh—whereas the eſſence of the true plague conſiſts in this, that it deſtroys more than half who are ſeized with it." He however conſiders theſe fevers as differing moſtly in degree of malignity, and therefore treats of them under one head.</p>
                  <p>A peſtilent fever this author conſiders as not proceeding ſolely from intemperate heat, or putridity; but from a malignant and poiſonous quality; and whenever this quality appears in a fever, whether quotidian, hectic or putrid, he thinks it ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated <hi>peſtilent.</hi> A peſtilent fever differs from the plague as ſpecies from genus becauſe there may be plague without fever.</p>
                  <p>This author remarks alſo the connection between certain epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics. "Many deadly diſeaſes accompany the prevalence of peſtilence—as phrenitis, anginas, pleuriſies, peripneumonies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations of the liver, dyſenteries and many others." He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes epidemics to the ſtate of air, as a common cauſe, to which he adds the uſual local or particular cauſes, which modify its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.</p>
                  <p>Proſper Alpinus informs us that theſe diſeaſes prevail alſo in Egypt, at certain times; but he gives no account of their order or connection. Vol. 2. p. 73.</p>
                  <p>Bellinus deſcribes the phenomena which precede the plague, which he calls its <hi>antecedents.</hi> After mentioning food of a bad quality, impure air from exhalations, intemperate ſeaſons, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours emitted during earthquakes and the like, he ſays, "Mox

                  <p>Other authors refer this cataſtrophe to the period of peſtilence laſt mentioned, which ſome writers place in the year of Rome 388, and others, in 384; but all agree that it was during the approximation of a comet. This laſt peſtilence was dreadful in the extreme, ſparing no age or ſex. The year after it, the earth opened and exhibited a vaſt chaſm in the midſt of Rome, into which M. Curtius precipitated himſelf for the ſalvation and proſperity of the city.</p>
                  <bibl>Livy, b. 7. 7.</bibl>
                  <p>P. Oroſius and P. Diaconus, followed by Muratori, place the commencement of this plague in the year of Rome 384. Oroſius ſays that "in the 103d and 105th Olympiad, Italy was ſhaken a whole year, by tremendous earthquakes. The hundred and third Olympiad, according to our common chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, comprehends the years of Rome from 386 to 389, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive. It is probable that in one of the ſhocks of this ſeries of earthquakes, the chaſm was made in Rome as already related. It will be obſerved that this event <hi>followed</hi> the peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>The comet that appeared, during this calamity, was probably that mentioned by Ariſtotle, Meteorol. lib. 1. ca. 6, of which he was an eye-witneſs.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt not omit what authors relate concerning the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar character of this plague. Oroſius ſays, it was not ſuch a peſtilence, as uſually proceeded from irregular ſeaſons, extreme drouth, ſudden heat of the ſpring, unſeaſonable moiſture of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and autumn, or the impure air blown from the Calabrian groves; but ſevere and continued, attacking all deſcriptions of people, and either deſtroying their lives, or leaving them in a weak and miſerable condition.</p>
                  <p>The winter when the comet appeared Ariſtotle relates to have been cold; but the ſeverity and duration of the plague cannot be accounted for on the principle of changes or irregularities in the ſeaſons. It was one of thoſe violent epidemics which never afflict mankind, without ſome eſſential alteration in the inviſible

began to appear, ſix months before the arrival of the infection from Syria!</p>
                  <p>In Aleppo, the plague which appeared in 1742, was <hi>preceded</hi> by an acute fever; and after the diſeaſe abated in July, appeared diarrheas and dyſentery of a malignant type, attended in many caſes with petechae, and intermittents which often proved fatal. Theſe diſeaſes, in their acute forms, prevailed alſo with the plague, which in this year was not ſevere, nor wholly the predominant epidemic.</p>
                  <p>This continued acute fever and pleuriſies, ran through the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In November appeared a few caſes of the plague. Where the <hi>infection</hi> had lain dormant from July to November, the author of this account, Alexander Ruſſell, has not informed us.</p>
                  <p>In the ſpring of 1743, the plague again appeared and ſpread in the city, and at the uſual time in ſummer ſubſided, being again ſucceeded by other acute diſorders, which by bleeding and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, were formed into tertians, double tertians and quotidians.</p>
                  <p>Here again we have the ſame progreſſion in the ſtate of the peſtilence, which had been remarked by Hippocrates, Bacon and Sydenham. During the exiſtence of this peſtilential conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Aleppo, all the ordinary diſeaſes of the country aſſumed a more malignant type; or as Sydenham remarked of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which preceded the plague of 1665, they "differed from the ſame diſeaſes in other years, by new and unuſual ſymptoms, which in ſhort amounted to this, that they were all <hi>more violent.</hi>" See vol. 1, p. 20.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſes changed their form with the ſeaſons—the acute fever preceding ran into plague, and plague ran into malignant dyſentery, tertians, and other acute diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>Similar facts are obſerved in America. The plague has been preceded by acute diſeaſes, as anginas, remittents of a bad type, &amp;c. and followed by remittents, dyſentery and malignant pleuriſy.</p>
                  <p>The dreadful plague at Meſſina in 1743, which deſtroyed two thirds of its inhabitants, was introduced by a malignant fever. One phyſician alone out of thirty-three, pronounced it the plague; the others denied it, becauſe the diſeaſe was not attended with glandular ſwellings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="unknown:036687_0402_100AA3D1D7B198F8"/>A ſimilar fever preceded the ſevere plague at Venice in 1576, and the ſame uncertainty at firſt embarraſſed the phyſicians and magiſtracy.</p>
                  <p>The terrible peſtilence at Naples in 1656, was announced by the uſual herald of the diſeaſe, a malignant fever. One phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian alone pronounced it the plague, and for his audacity was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by the Viceroy.</p>
                  <p>The extenſive peſtilence which ſpread over all the Levant countries and iſlands, from 1759 to 1763, was every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by a ſimilar increaſe of malignant diſeaſes, and eſpecially by the petechial fever, which appeared, at Aleppo, in the year next previous to the plague. Yet the author of this account, Patrick Ruſſel, labors very gravely to trace the diſeaſe to Turks from Egypt and their old clothes.</p>
                  <p>The uncertainty among phyſicians, at the commencement of a plague, with reſpect to the nature of the diſorder, is a ſtrong proof of the doctrin for which I contend. Van Helmont, Diemer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broeck and others have found it neceſſary to lay down rules with a great degree of care and caution, to enable themſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin, whether a malignant diſeaſe is the plague or not. Van Helmont obſerves, p. 1138 that he could perceive no difference in the pulſe, in plague and continual fevers of the malignant kind —that buboes in the groin, paroitides, &amp;c. are not unfrequently found in fevers free from plague; and ſometimes ſpots and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles. But, ſays he, if many of theſe appearances do concur, there is no difficulty in pronouncing it the plague, eſpecially if they appear before or early after the fever.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck declares, that no one ſymptom determines a diſeaſe to be the plague—neither fever, buboes nor carbuncles are eſſential to that diſeaſe, for it often paſſes off without either— many of its ſymptoms are common to that and other diſtempers— the exiſtence of the diſeaſe therefore is to be determined by a view of all the circumſtances, and one criterion, he remarks, is, the prevalence of the plague in neighboring towns.</p>
                  <p>This laſt remark indicates that the author had obſerved the exiſtence of peſtilence in various places at the ſame time, to be a common event.</p>

This however has ever been a miſtake; they were the leſs malignant forms of approaching peſtilence; yet five or ſix weeks after their appearance, when the epidemic has ſhowed itſelf in its formidable array, our citizents have hunted out ſome veſſel from ſouthern climates and palmed the evil on her ſeamen or cargo.</p>
                  <p>Van Swieten, Comment. vol. 16, 3. remarks, "that the plague has ſometimes lain concealed under the maſk of other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. When the plague raged at Vienna in 1713, it frequently aſſumed the appearance of a pleuriſy, catarrh, or quinſy, but ſoon after, broke out buboes and carbuncles, moſt certain ſigns of the plague, accompanied with the uſual ſymptoms."</p>
                  <p>Here we obſerve the uſual precurſors and companions of the plague and the progreſſion of the peſtilential principle.</p>
                  <p>Hippocrates has remarked the augmented violence of diſeaſes, in particular periods. He ſays, "There are times when almoſt all the diſeaſes that occur, are extremely malignant, and in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, fatal, ſo that coughs, phthiſis, angina, are all equally mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. He aſſures us, that the truth of his obſervations had been confirmed, in countries very different from each other, and in a variety of ſeaſons and climates." See the paſſage cited in Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merman on phyſic, p. 163.</p>
                  <p>We have multiplied proofs of the juſtneſs of theſe remarks. During the periods which I call <hi>peſtilential,</hi> the common diſeaſes of a country, as dyſentery, and intermittents, become more obſtinate and mortal; and even the pleuriſy and peripneumony, acquire unuſual violence. And it may not be improper to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat an obſervation before made, that the malignant or epidemic pleuriſy never appears, excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It precedes or follows, in winter, ſpring or autumn, thoſe ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers alone when peſtilence invades our cities. Such was the dreadful diſeaſe in America, in 1697-8—in 1761—and which has ſhowed itſelf, in ſeveral towns, during the preſent peſtilential conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>But a moſt ſatisfactory proof of the progreſſiveneſs in a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential ſtate of air, and in the correſponding malignity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, is found in the bills of mortality. Thus, before the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don plague in 1625, the bill of mortality roſe from 8 or 9000, the ſtandard of health, to 11,000 in 1623, and to 12,000 in 1624. The approach of peſtilence was clearly announced, two years before it appeared. And as the time of its appearance drew near, the extenſion or malignity of the preceding fevers was greatly augmented; for in the year of the plague, almoſt nineteen thouſand perſons died of other diſeaſes than the plague. As the plague uſually prevails from June or July to November, and other diſeaſes are moſtly merged in it, almoſt all the deaths by common diſeaſes muſt have been in the beginning of the year, from January to June or July. Now, eighteen thouſand deaths in the ſix months preceding the plague, or even two thirds of the number, mark a prodigious increaſe of mortality—the <hi>common ſign of approaching peſtilence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the peſtilential period in London, from 1634 to 1636, the bill of mortality roſe two years previous to the plague.</p>
                  <p>The laſt great plague, in 1665, was announced by unuſual malignity in diſeaſes, four years before its appearance. In 1661, according to Sydenham, began a ſeries of epidemics, which greatly ſwelled the liſt of burials. There was however ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement in 1663; but in 1664, and the firſt five months of 1665, the mortality again increaſed with rapidity, till a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful peſtilence laid waſte the city.</p>
                  <p>A ſimilar increaſe of mortality is obſervable in the bills for Augſburg, previous to the plague in 1628, and in 1635—in Dreſden, in 1632 and 3—in Philadelphia in 1793, in New-York in 1795, and in New-London in 1798.</p>
                  <p>It muſt however be obſerved, that the bills of mortality will
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036687_0405_100AA41150EB0A18"/>
not, in all caſes, exhibit the augmented number and malignancy of the diſeaſes which precede peſtilence; for it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the year next preceding the plague, is very healthy, and the malignancy in the diſtempers, which mark the beginning of the peſtilential ſtate, does not appear till the winter or ſpring previous to the plague. In this caſe, the augmented mortality falls within the year and the ſame bills, as the deaths by the plague. This was the caſe in Augſburg in the year 1535. In ſuch caſes, there is an interval between the preceding epidemics and the plague; ſuch as we have obſerved in the New-England States, between the influenza and the ſcarlet fever, and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſeaſe and the yellow fever.</p>
                  <p>Monthly bills will exhibit the progreſs of peſtilential epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics, with more accuracy.</p>
                  <p>Fernelius remarks page 161, that "infection is to be perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the air, when it produces fevers not peſtilent, but which are at the threſhhold of peſtilence,"—plainly intimating that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain malignant diſeaſes precede the plague. He ſpeaks of the fact as general and well underſtood.</p>
                  <p>Even in the Weſt-Indies, the infectious yellow fever has its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſors. That fever in Barbadoes, in 1738, was preceded by catarrh and ſuffocating cough in 1737 and ſpring of 1738. Yet authors pretend the diſeaſe to have been <hi>imported</hi> from Martinico!</p>
                  <bibl>See Warren and Short, vol. 2. 164.</bibl>
                  <p>The different modes in which peſtilence invades mankind, ſeem to depend on different cauſes. Sometimes, the principal cauſe ſeems to be an eſſential alteration in the inviſible properties of the elements; in which caſe, the diſeaſes of a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, tho ſomewhat modified in their ſymptoms, are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled or arreſted by the ſeaſons. On the contrary the atmoſphere continues to be peſtilential, and to multiply diſorders of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant type, through every variety of ſeaſons and of weather. Thus, we obſerve many inſtances of violent plagues in the moſt pleaſant, and to all appearance, the moſt ſalubrious ſeaſons. Several inſtances have been mentioned in the preceding hiſtory, and we have demonſtration of the fact in the United States. The preſent peſtilential ſtate commenced with the meaſles and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036687_0406_100AA3D90E0FC310"/>
catarrh of 1789 and 90.—The ſummers of 1794 and of 1797 were apparently temperate and ſalubrious; yet in both theſe ſummers, the plague renewed its ravages in ſome towns, tho with leſs mortality than in the ſultry and unhealthy ſummers of 1793-95 and 98.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, peſtilence ſometimes proceeds principally from exceſſively intemperate ſeaſons, as in ſevere heat, after a cold winter. In this caſe, the peſtilence may invade a city very ſuddenly and without a regular augmentation of mortality from previous diſeaſes. But even in this caſe, the plague has its precur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, which appear at leaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> a few weeks, if not two or three months previous to its attack.</p>
                  <p>Thus the plague in Aleppo in 1742, firſt ſhowed itſelf in the ſuburbs in April; but was preceded by an acute fever in March. The bilious plague in Philadelphia in 1793, according to Dr. Ruſh, was preceded by the influenza, ſcarlatina and bilious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents. The ſame diſeaſe in 1797 appeared, in ſcattering ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as early as June.</p>
                  <p>In New-York, the epidemic of 1795 was preceded by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina trachealis with anomalous ſymptoms, ſome caſes of obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate dyſentery, at a premature ſtage of ſummer, and by febrile complaints accompanied with bilious evacuations. At a meeting of the medical ſociety, early in July, theſe facts were mentioned, as denoting an uncommon ſtate of air, and the ſociety came to a reſolution, to make particular obſervations on the diſeaſes that might occur, before their next meeting. But, in the interval, the criſis of the peſtilence arrived, and removed all doubts.</p>

                  <p>The ſevere peſtilence of the year 1798 doubtleſs owes its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to a ſeries of moſt intemperate weather—moſt exceſſive heat, following a long and ſeverely cold winter. Yet this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was preceded by premonitory ſigns, eſpecially catarrhal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Of all the diſorders to which mankind are expoſed, none ſeem to indicate a peſtilential ſtate of air, with ſo much certainty as catarrhal affections. They almoſt always precede the plague —uſually accompany it, and ſometimes tread cloſe upon its heels.</p>

of the progreſſion of peſtilence, let me mention Skenkius, who, in ſpeaking of the diſeaſes of 1564 and 5, obſerves, that angi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, pleuriſies and peripneumonies became epidemic; abortions were frequent, pains in the joints, ſmall pox and meaſles "quos tanquam praecurſores ſequebatur epidemica lues, incredibili graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſationis ſaevitia," depopula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Skenkius remarked that the plague followed the other epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics, as <hi>its precurſors.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame author takes notice of a malignant angina, in 1564, which often proved fatal in a few hours, like the plague. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this, becauſe the learned Dr. Fothergill, and tribes of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern phyſicians who follow a celebrated name, have alledged that the angina maligna is a new diſeaſe, not known in Europe till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1610, altho it never was more fatal, than in England in 1517.</p>
                  <p>In 1573 prevailed dyſentery, meaſles, and purple fever, which in 1574, ſays Skenkius, <hi>changed into the plague.</hi> His words are remarkable. "Dudum ſane praeſagiebat animus mihi, malignum hoc febrium genus, quod toto biennio Europae partem non mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam peragravit, velut ſparſis quibuſdam praeludiis, in peſtem aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimam tranſiturum. Neque me adeo mea fefellit opinio." Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv. p. 761. This author foreſaw the plague, by means of its precurſors.</p>
                  <p>"Eodem modo variolae, morbilli, dyſenteriae groſſantes, ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſime ſunt praecurſores internuncii peſtis." Epidemic ſmall-pox, meaſles and dyſentery, are very often the forerunners of the plague.</p>
                  <bibl>Hoſtices, p. 253.</bibl>
                  <p>It is a common remark that the reigning epidemic ſubdues all other diſeaſes, or compels them to aſſume its character. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, as a general one, is juſt; and is of no ſmall weight, in proving the connection between certain ſpecies of epidemics. In the ſpring of 1795, the meaſles prevailed in New-York, but of a mild type. In Auguſt, this diſeaſe diſappeared, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely merged in the bilious fever that ſpread from Auguſt to November. No ſooner had the fever ſubſided, than the meaſles
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:036687_0408_100AA3D6AFF29CC8"/>
re-appeared, and was of a leſs favorable type. This is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe, and yet how impotent was its contagion, in the inſtance related, under the all-controlling influence of the ſeaſon and the elements.—It diſappeared in ſummer in defiance of the powers of ſpecific contagion, and was reproduced in autumn, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>This fact demonſtrates that a general cauſe operated in the production of that diſeaſe; which general cauſe, in ſummer, was controlled, by the heat of the ſeaſon and local cauſes in that city; theſe temporary and local cauſes operated during a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar time, and gave a different complexion to diſeaſes; when they gave way, at the approach of winter, the general cauſe again aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed its empire and reproduced the meaſles, which is a diſeaſe little affected by local cauſes.</p>
                  <p>But while local cauſes predominated, in producing bilious plague, the general cauſe was not altogether inefficient; no bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious peſtilence ever becoming epidemic and infectious, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the influence of a peſtilential conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>A fact related in Fairfield's diary, relative to the ſmall-pox in Boſton in 1702, is very much in point.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe appeared in June and gave much alarm; but prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of a mild type, and none died of it for ſeveral weeks. It continued to be favorable, till September, when it aſſumed a more formidable aſpect; being attended with what the writer calls a ſcarlet fever. The ſeaſon was exceſſively dry. In De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, the ſcarlet fever abated, but the ſmall-pox continued to be very mortal, till the following ſpring. Theſe facts are relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an unlettered, obſerving man; but they are evidence of a progreſſiveneſs in the diſeaſe. The effloreſcence that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the diſeaſe from September to December was only a partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular, malignant ſymptom or modification of the ſmall-pox, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ſeaſon or other temporary cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The meaſles often exhibits a ſimilar progreſſion. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance explains the difficulties mentioned by medical writers. Dr. Ruſh mentions the circumſtance of perſons in 1789, who had a fever, cough and all the ſymptoms of meaſles, except a general eruption. Some had a trifling effloreſcence about the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036687_0409_100AA416F880E3B8"/>
neck and breaſt. The ſame happened in 1773 and 1783. Vol. 2. 238. The fact is alſo mentioned in Edinburgh Medical Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays, vol. 5. Perſons thus affected have the meaſles, months or years afterwards. This lighter ſpecies of the meaſles is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſame general cauſe which produces the diſeaſe in full force; but the conſtitution, at that time, reſiſts the further operation of the cauſe. At a future time the cauſe will produce the diſeaſe complete.</p>
                  <p>Under the hiſtory of the diſeaſes of 1792 and 3, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the progreſs of the late ſcarlatina in this country. There cannot be ſtronger evidence of the progreſſion of an epidemic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the atmoſphere than the hiſtory of that diſtemper has furniſhed. The violent ſtage of that diſeaſe, was preceded four, five, and in ſome places eight months, by a milder ſpecies of the diſorder; and this mild form was, in ſome places, an epidemic. Theſe facts entirely overwhelm all the pretended influence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, in originating the diſeaſe. They prove inconteſtibly that a ſtate of air ſuited to the production of that diſeaſe, was not the effect of any ſudden, viſible change in the ſeaſons; for the mild form of the ſcarlatina appeared indifferently, in any ſeaſon of the year; as at New-York in Auguſt, at Hartford in May and at New-Haven in November; but that it was a progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive change, gradually inducing debility in the human body, or whatever elſe may be its prediſpoſition to a particular diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Whether the ſcarlatina appeared, in any part of the country, without being announced by this ſlight form of the diſeaſe, is a queſtion that cannot be ſolved, without particular information from every town. And very poſſibly the fact itſelf may have paſſed, in ſome places, unobſerved. But the progreſſiveneſs of the diſtemper was diſtinctly marked in New-York, in Fairfield, in New-Haven, in Bethlem and in Hartford.</p>
                  <p>The ſame phenomenon was obſerved in the ſame diſeaſe, in 1786, in London. The firſt caſe appeared in March, was of a mild kind and excited no great apprehenſion. No other caſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to the knowledge of the phyſician, except in the ſame family, till May, when another caſe appeared, but of a light kind. In June, the diſeaſe became epidemic and malignant.

Here we obſerve the progreſs of the peſtilential principle, in England, like that which has been obſerved in America.</p>
                  <bibl>See Memoirs of the Medical Society, London, vol. 1. 388.</bibl>
                  <p>A remarkable fact mentioned by the great Mr. Boyle, in the fifth volume of his works, p. 724, ſerves to ſhow the regular progreſſion of that ſtate of air which produces the plague. In 1665, three months before the plague broke out in London, a man ſent for a phyſician, complaining of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſwelling in his groin, from which circumſtance he predicted the plague which was to follow, and ſaid he had experienced the ſame ſwelling in the former plagues, which he conſidered as the certain forerunner of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Boyle took this account from the phyſician himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This was no whim, for it is perfectly philoſophical. It is a common fact, that, during the plague, in a city, perſons in health experience ſevere pains in the glands, as in the groin and under the arms, thoſe ſenſible parts which are peculiarly affected by the diſeaſe. Sorbait mentions that he felt ſuch pains, during the plague in Vienna in 1679, and others did the ſame, but without any tumor. Dr. Gothwald experienced ſimilar pains in the plague at Dantzick in 1709.</p>
                  <bibl>See Baddam's Memoirs, vol. 6. 12.</bibl>
                  <p>Boyle, vol. 6. 429, relates that one Beale knew a woman who could certainly tell when the plague was in the neighboring country, by a pain in the wounds of three ſores ſhe had, when affected by the plague in her youth. The relation is altogether credible; for we know that the ſtate of air producing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, occaſions pains in the glands of perſons in health; much more therefore would the ſame parts, after being rendered more ſenſible by plague ſores, be affected with pain, during a ſimilar ſtate of air. The facts demonſtrate that the plague is produced by a peculiar ſtate of air, which may be perceived before the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe appears; and much more, during its prevalance, by perſons in health.</p>
                  <p>Another fact demonſtrative of the ſame doctrin of a progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the peſtilential principle, is, the unuſual number of abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which <hi>precede</hi> the invaſion of a ſevere plague. This fact was obſerved by Diemerbroeck, previous to the plague in Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mueguen,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036687_0411_100AA41994FDC398"/>
in 1636, and is numbered by him among the preſages of the diſeaſe. De peſte page 11. Other authors have record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame fact, among whom Diemerbroeck cites Alexander Benedictus, Foreſtus and Seunertus.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe aſſigned for this phenomenon, is, "the debility of the heart and other viſcera, which renders the tender body of the foetus incapable of reſiſting the malignity of the peſtilential poiſon, and which expoſes the woman in a pregnant ſtate, to continual irritation."</p>
                  <p>In confirmation of this principle, we may cite the facts, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned by writers on this ſubject, that the plague rarely or never ſpares pregnant women. This was remarked by Livy and Dionyſius in Rome—by Procopius and Evagrius, in the plagues of 543 and 590, and by ſubſequent writers.</p>
                  <p>The fact authorizes the ſuppoſition, that a peſtilential ſtate of air induces extreme excitement or irritability, and conſequently indirect debility, eſpecially in the nervous and vaſcular ſyſtems. The effect of this general cauſe muſt of courſe be firſt viſible in perſons moſt ſuſceptible of excitement—among whom are preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant women, which is obvious from the facility with which they receive impreſſions from the ſight of unnatural objects. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the effect of the peſtilential ſtate of the atmoſphere, on ſuch perſons, <hi>previous to its fatal effects on other perſons,</hi> leaves no room to queſtion its gradual increaſe in ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Of the progreſſiveneſs of peſtilential epidemics therefore we can have no doubt, nor of their connection through a common cauſe. The order i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> which they ſhow themſelves is not exactly the ſame; being varied by a multitude of ſubordinate cauſes, as ſeaſons, weather, noxious exhalations, and ſometimes perhaps by infection.</p>
                  <p>The accounts of diſeaſes in the two or three laſt centuries are recorded with ſo little regard to juſt arrangement, that it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036687_0412_100AA3DDF28ACC08"/>
ought to be well ſtudied, and which it is inexcuſeable in medical writers not to imitate. Let any man obſerve the regularity with which certain eruptive diſeaſes, as the meaſles and ſmall-pox, appeared and ſubſided, according to the ſeaſons, during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of air fitted to produce them, until both yielded to a different conſtitution, and then ſay, whether he can queſtion Sydenham's principles, or the exiſtence of a general contagion, operating in the production of a particular claſs of diſeaſes. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a philoſophical view of ſuch facts, into what trifles will dwindle all the formidable vulgar doctrines about infection!</p>
                  <p>It muſt however be remarked, that the ſmall-pox, in modern times, will not exhibit ſimilar effects as formerly; ſince the art of inoculation has nearly baniſhed the diſeaſe as an epidemic, from our cities, where alone it uſed to prevail to any conſiderable extent.</p>
                  <p>Let us then attend to the order of the epidemics which have marked the lateſt periods of peſtilence in America; many of which are within the memory of the preſent generation.</p>

                  <p>Such has been the general courſe of epidemic diſeaſes in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, as far as I can obtain information. Further enquiries may render the account more accurate, and more nearly perfect.</p>
                  <p>It will be obſerved that the order is not quite uniform; nor is this to be expected, conſidering the various cauſes which concur in the production, and diverſification of diſeaſes. In general, meaſles and catarrh precede anginas, dyſentery and peſtilential fevers. And it is remarkable that theſe diſeaſes belong to the claſs of inflammatory diatheſis: So does the mild ſmall-pox, which, before the practice of inoculation, was almoſt regularly a precurſor of the plague in the cities of Europe.</p>
                  <p>In general then epidemic diſeaſes firſt attack the brain and the throat, before they ſeize the whole nervous ſyſtem and the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal viſcera. It is obſervable alſo, that winter, ſpring and autumn, produce moſtly diſeaſes of the ſtenic diatheſis, as meaſles, catarrh, and inflammatory fevers; and ſummer, diſeaſes of aſtenic diathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, as typhus fevers, dyſentery of a malignant kind, and plague. Indeed the plague ſeems to begin and end in catarrh—that is, it begins in catarrh in winter and ſpring, takes the form of plague, during the hot ſeaſon, and re-aſſumes the catarrhal and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory form in the ſucceeding winter. The meaſles and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, however, prevail at any ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>When I arrange epidemics under particular years, I ſpeak of thoſe diſeaſes which extend over a whole country, or occur in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places. If we look into large cities, we ſhall find ſome of theſe diſeaſes, almoſt every year. But my obſervations relate on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe diſeaſes when they become general, or occur in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of a country in the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="unknown:036687_0415_100AA41E5EBA45A0"/>When I place angina, plague and dyſentery againſt a particular year, it is not intended that theſe diſeaſes were all epidemic in the ſame place. Thus, while in 1793 the plague was in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, the ſcarlatina began to prevail in New-York and the weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern part of Connecticut. For it muſt not be overlooked, that although meaſles and influenza appear nearly at the ſame time in all parts of the United States, yet the peſtilential fevers that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them firſt ſhow themſelves in the larger cities in the ſouthern latitudes. Thus the meaſles and influenza were univerſal in 1789 and 90, at leaſt this was the caſe with the influenza; but the bili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous plague broke out in New-York, Philadelphia and Charleſton, before it did in Boſton and Newburyport. The ſame is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the other hemiſphere. The influenza ſpreads over Aſia, Europe and Africa, in a few weeks, but the following peſtilence firſt appears in Egypt or the Levant, or in Turkey, then in the northern parts of Europe. To theſe remarks there are few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo obſervable, that the peſtilence in cities takes the form of petechial fever and plague; but in country towns, more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally terminates in dyſentery.</p>
                  <p>It is a popular opinion that meaſles and ſmall-pox never origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the human conſtitution, without contagion. The palpable abſurdity of ſuch an opinion has not prevented its propagation and belief, among even well-informed men. So far is this opinion from truth, that the firſt caſes of theſe diſeaſes in every epidemic period, are always generated in the human body, without conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. When the condition of the elements is fitted to produce theſe diſeaſes, they appear in all parts of a country, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, they ſpread rapidly, and decline when the general cauſes ceaſe to operate. During this period, contagion is efficacious in propagating them, and no longer. When the condition of the elements is not fitted to produce them, if ſporadic caſes appear in particular habits of body, they will not always ſpread the diſeaſes.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is here meant of the natural contagion of the diſeaſes from the breath and effluvia, which is not always efficacious in ſpreading them. The variolous matter of ſmall-pox is excepted; for, if good, this will generally communicate the diſeaſe at any time.</note> Sydenham long ago taught this truth, in deſcribing the changes
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:036687_0416_100AA3E25A32B5F8"/>
in the epidemics of 1670—1672. Meaſles and ſmall-pox came and went with the ſeaſons and condition of the air.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, that certain conditions of the elements tend to produce <hi>eruptive diſeaſes,</hi> and before the practice of inoculation, the ſmall pox was almoſt regularly one of that ſeries of epidemics which I claſs together, as of one family, and the precurſors of plague. It is nearly allied to the meaſles, and appears uſually about the ſame time. I am convinced that catarrh, meaſles, mild ſmall-pox and whooping cough, are but varied forms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, occaſioned by modifications of the ſame elemental cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, they are all predominant about the ſame time, and as a general remark, they <hi>precede</hi> the invaſion of diſeaſes which bear the character of <hi>typhus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have never converſed with a phyſician who could not name inſtances of ſmall-pox, originating without any known contagion, and generally medical gentlemen admit the diſeaſe to be generated in the conſtitution. This principle is unqueſtionably juſt, and ought to be known, and received as truth; for the belief that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion is neceſſary to the exiſtence of the diſeaſe, has produced moſt miſchievous conſequences. An inſtance happened in Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a few years ago, in which a woman was ſeized with the ſmall-pox; but as ſhe had not been expoſed to contagion, her diſeaſe was miſtaken, till juſt before her death; and twenty or thirty perſons were ſuppoſed to have taken the diſeaſe before the true nature of it was underſtood.</p>
                  <p>In the winter of 1797-8, occurred in Hartford two ſporadic caſes of meaſles, which could not poſſibly be traced to contagion. At another time, a family was infected by means of a ſtranger; but in neither of theſe caſes was the diſeaſe propagated to others, who were expoſed to the breath of the patients. See Dr. Cogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's letter, Med. Repoſ. vol. 2. 301. Innumerable ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner the various ſpecies of angina and the plague occur in ſporadic caſes under the operation of powerful local and conſtitutional cauſes, which, if not favored by the condition of the elements, will not ſpread and become epidemic.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XIV. Of the extent of a peſtilential ſtate of air.</head>
                  <p>FROM a view of the facts related in the preceding hiſtory, it appears that epidemics, agreeable to the definition already giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, are of two kinds—firſt, thoſe which are limited to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar town, city or country; ſecondly, thoſe which pervade whole quarters of the earth, or the whole globe. The firſt may be called local, the laſt, general or univerſal epidemics.</p>
                  <p>The local epidemics, moſt uſual, are dyſentery, remitting and intermitting fevers, and peſtilence. The epidemic, moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently univerſal, is the catarrh or influenza. Angina is often a general epidemic, ſometimes local. Peſtilential fevers, in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain periods become general over vaſt tracts of the earth. The ſame is obſervable of the meaſles.</p>
                  <p>The epidemic catarrh is the diſorder which moſt deciſively proves a rapid and univerſal change in the eſſential properties of the atmoſphere. This diſeaſe ſometimes invades the human race ſo ſuddenly, that half the inhabitants of a town or city are ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a night. I do not find the ſame fact related of any other diſeaſe, except the ſweating plague in 1529, whoſe progreſs through Europe was as rapid nearly as that of the catarrh, and utterly precludes the ſuppoſition that infection from fomes, had any ſhare in its propagation.</p>
                  <p>Catarrh however is not always a univerſal epidemic. In many inſtances, it is confined to one hemiſphere, as in 1647, 1655, to America; and in 1650, 1775, to Europe.</p>
                  <p>In other inſtances, this diſeaſe ſpreads over the whole world, in a ſhort period, but is progreſſive, appearing in the two hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſpheres, in two different years. Thus in 1761, it was epidemic in America; in 1762 in Europe.—In 1781 in America; in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:036687_0418_100AA3E40D0A7870"/>
1782 in Europe; in 1698 in America; in 1699 in Europe. In two or three inſtances, I find it in both hemiſpheres in the ſame year.</p>
                  <p>The compilers of the Encyclopedia ſay that catarrh from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion has "ſeldom appeared in any one country in Europe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appearing ſucceſſively in almoſt every different part of it; and in ſome inſtances, it has been alſo <hi>transferred</hi> to America, and has been <hi>ſpread</hi> there, ſo far as we have had opportunities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed."</p>
                  <bibl>See article, Medicine, No. 253, from Cullen.</bibl>
                  <p>No ſource of errors, in the ſcience of medicin, is more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the doctrin of contagion. It would ſeem from the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage recited, that the writer conſidered catarrh as propagated by fomites from diſeaſed perſons; and conveyed acroſs the ocean by the ſick, or in goods or cloathing. The words will admit of no other interpretation; and yet it is hardly credible that, in this period of ſcience and obſervation, an obvious and common phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon ſhould be ſo egregiouſly miſunderſtood.</p>
                  <p>The catarrh, whenever it has appeared as a general epidemic, inſtead of being <hi>transferred</hi> to America, has uſually appeared in America <hi>before</hi> it has in Europe or at the ſame time; and ſo far is contagion from being the neceſſary cauſe of its origin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation, that the diſeaſe invades ſeamen on the ocean in the ſame hemiſphere, when a hundred leagues from land, at the ſame time that it invades people on ſhore. Of this I have certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from the teſtimony of American Captains of veſſels, who have been on their paſſage from the continent to the Weſt-India Iſlands, during the prevalence of this diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>If further evidence is required, we have the fact, that the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic catarrh in America rages with as much violence in the iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands as on the continent, and at the ſame time. And in the preceding hiſtory, it is ſtated on the authority of a medical publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Scotland, that the univerſal catarrh of 1733, appeared in the Iſle of Bourbon, in the Indian Ocean, about the time it did in Europe.</p>
                  <p>From theſe facts, it is evident that the diſeaſe is occaſioned by an alteration in the atmoſphere. In many inſtances it is limited to one hemiſphere; but it is obſervable, that whenever it appears
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036687_0419_100AA422F6C08A60"/>
on the American continent, it appears alſo in the iſlands of the Weſt-Indies. Its range is through a certain ſection of the globe, nearly in the ſame longitude, north and ſouth, on one of the great diviſions of the earth, and in the vicinity of the continent. The epidemic catarrh of America extends certainly from the northern limits of the United States to the iſland of Barbadoes. Whether it appears at the ſame time in South-America, I cannot find a hint in any author to guide my opinion, except in regard to the laſt epidemic, which pervaded that part of the continent.</p>
                  <p>The catarrh of 1733 extended over the globe, but it appeared firſt in America. Poſſibly there may have been other inſtances, ſince the ſettlement of America, but I have little information on this point, in regard to this country. It is not probable, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the ſevere catarrh of 1708-9, was confined to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, but it is uſeleſs to indulge conjecture.</p>
                  <p>The remote cauſe uſually aſſigned for catarrh is a ſudden change of weather, from heat to cold or from cold to heat—the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe, an increaſed afflux of fluids to the mucous membrane of the noſe, fances and bronchiae, with ſome degree of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some medical writers ſeem to think the remote cauſe to be the application of cold only to the human body, checking the perſpiration by the ſkin, and turning the fluids upon the mucous membrane. See Cullen on this point.</p>
                  <p>The proximate cauſes of the diſeaſe are the province of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal men; but to the influence of the remote cauſe above ſtated, phyſicians will pardon me for ſtating a few objections.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The application of cold to the body cannot be the ſole cauſe of catarrh, becauſe it appears, and uſually with moſt ſeverity, in the ſpring, on the abſtraction of cold. It is obſervable alſo, that in many inſtances its principal violence and mortality, are, after the return of warm weather—the diſeaſe augmenting in violence with the increaſe of heat. Thus the catarrh of 1709 appeared in Italy, ſays Lanciſius, in January in ſevere cold weather, but increaſed in violence, as the ſpring advanced and the weather moderated.</p>
                  <p>The ſame fact took place in the catarrh of 1762 at Edinburgh, where it began in April and increaſed in violence till June.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame manner, the catarrh in this country in 1790, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in March and April, on the moderation of cold, was far
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:036687_0420_100AA3E7E1FE7038"/>
more ſevere than that of the preceding autumn, when the weather was changing from heat to cold. At leaſt this was the fact in many of the northern ſtates.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not always true, that the epidemic catarrh appears in ſpring or autumn, or after great changes of weather. The noted catarrh of 1580 began to appear in Sicily in the month of June; at Rome in July; at Venice and Conſtantinople in Auguſt—in the midſt of ſummer. It is againſt all probability, that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe can be aſcribed to the application of cold. On the other hand, its progreſs was evidently ſteady, and uninterrupted by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heat or cold—A careful attention to the hiſtory of this epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic at other times, will doubtleſs furniſh other ſimilar facts.</p>
                  <p>The catarrh of 1688 ſeized Germany in ſummer; that of 1557 appeared in Spain in Auguſt; that in America in 1655 began about the cloſe of June.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The appearance of catarrh in tropical climates, as in the Weſt-Indies, at the ſame time it appears in northern latitudes, is a ſtrong argument againſt aſcribing it to the application of cold. In the Weſt-Indies there is no change of any great conſequence, in the temperature of the weather; nothing like <hi>cold</hi> is known in thoſe regions. Yet catarrh, if credible accounts are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as evidence, is as fatal at times within the tropics, as in any other climate.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that in autumn winds called <hi>norths,</hi> northerly breezes, are experienced in the iſlands, and theſe produce colds and coughs ſimilar to what we all experience, in temperate latitudes, on the change of weather in ſpring and autumn. But theſe are very different, at leaſt in degree, from a general epidemic influenza, which ſeizes mankind in all climates, with pain in the ſide and bones, accompanied often with fever. The univerſality of this diſeaſe, burſting ſuddenly upon all climates, and raging with equal violence in all ſeaſons, and in defiance of heat or cold, leave us no room to queſtion its dependence on ſome other cauſe than changes of weather or application of cold.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the application of cold was the ſole cauſe of this epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic, it would appear at the ſame time in all places which experience a ſudden change from heat to cold at the ſame time. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036687_0421_100AA42484D60980"/>
a neceſſary conſequence would be, it muſt be epidemic on every ſuch change. Neither of theſe caſes occurs. On the other hand, the diſeaſe begins indifferently in any climate and in any ſeaſon of the year, and ſpreads ſpeedily over whole countries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt obſtruction from heat or cold: And as far as I can obſerve from the accounts of it before me, it is as mortal when it invades people in hot climates, as in cold or temperate regions and ſeaſons. It is alſo progreſſive in point of place; but it moves with a celerity unknown to all other diſeaſes. Sometimes it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes over Europe in ſix weeks. In America, its duration in 1789 and in 1790, was nearly the ſame. Different epidemics, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, differ in the rapidity of their movements: That of 1580 was about ſix months in traverſing Europe.</p>
                  <p>Different epidemics alſo differ in point of generality and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Sometimes the catarrh is a light complaint; at other times it is attended with fever, and occaſions no inconſiderable mortality. The catarrh in the ſpring of 1790, was much more ſevere than that of the autumn preceding. In 1789, it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled a ſevere and univerſal cold—in 1790, it bordered more on the pleuriſy and peripneumony. To theſe remarks there may have been particular exceptions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It appears to me alſo, that, with deference to the faculty, a ſtrong argument againſt deriving the diſeaſe from ſudden chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of weather only, may be drawn from a difference in the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of an epidemic influenza and of ſporadic caſes of the diſeaſe, obviouſly contracted by cold. Let me aſk practitioners, whether in the epidemic catarrh, there do not appear ſymptoms altogether unknown in ſporadic caſes? But as this is a point that regards practice, it is not proper for me to diſcuſs it.</p>
                  <p>The celebrated Boyle very juſtly obſerves that ſudden epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic colds, are not to be accounted for by changes of weather. Vol. 5, p. 49.</p>
                  <p>I do not, however, deny the influence of heat and cold in the epidemic catarrh. In ſome violent epidemics of this ſort, heat and cold ſeem to have little influence—the diſeaſe appearing to rage, independent of all the ſenſible qualities of the air. Yet in ordinary caſes, the temperature of the air ſeems to <hi>modify,</hi> but not to <hi>generate</hi> or <hi>deſtroy</hi> the epidemic.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:036687_0422_100AA3E9670BA6B8"/>Brown, in his elements of medicin, arranges catarrh among diſeaſes of the ſtenic diatheſis. Whether he meant to extend his obſervation to ſporadic caſes from cold only, or to the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za alſo, I do not know; but it may not be improper in me to mention, that in many epidemics of this ſort, bleeding has proved injurious or fatal. The moſt generally ſucceſsful remedies have been the diaphoretic, although there have been a few exceptions, in which bleeding was ſalutary. Indeed no diſeaſe ſeems to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a greater diverſity of ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>Next to the catarrh, in the liſt of general epidemics, we may perhaps arrange the meaſles, which, though ſometimes a local diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, often appears over whole countries, and ſometimes in both hemiſpheres at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>This diſeaſe is attended with ſpecific contagion, which aids its communication from place to place; but it derives its origin from a particular ſtate of the atmoſphere. Hence it appears in one ſeaſon and diſappears in another, yielding to ſome other diſeaſe, as Sydenham remarked in the year 1672, and which we obſerved in New-York in 1795. It is nearly allied to the catarrh as is evident from the catarrhous ſymptoms that attend it. Brown claſſes the meaſles in the number of ſtenic diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>It will be found on examining the hiſtory of diſeaſes, that the meaſles uſually <hi>precedes</hi> or <hi>follows</hi> an epidemic influenza. The two diſeaſes therefore manifeſt a cloſe alliance in the remote cauſes.</p>
                  <p>My accounts of epidemics are too imperfect to authorize the aſſertion, that theſe diſeaſes <hi>always</hi> appear nearly together; but this has been the fact, with reſpect to a number of the laſt epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic periods in America. The order however is varied. Sometimes alſo a ſlight degree of one or both of theſe diſeaſes is experienced in particular places, when neither of them is epidemic. But when they become violent and general, they are nearly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaneous, ſpreading ſucceſſively over a large portion of the earth, and ſometimes over both hemiſpheres.</p>
                  <p>In 1772 the catarrh and meaſles raged in the ſame year, from Boſton to Charleſton. To theſe ſucceeded anginas and dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for a ſeries of years. In 1781 and 2 catarrh pervaded the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036687_0423_100AA4271306A6B8"/>
globe. In 1783 began meaſles in May, and angina in Auguſt. In 1789 meaſles preceded the influenza. In 1757 influenza preceded the meaſles.</p>
                  <p>An epidemic which uſed formerly to make a figure in medical hiſtory, as one nearly cotemporary with meaſles, was the ſmall-pox. The diſeaſe was obſerved by Sydenham, to rage alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with meaſles in different ſeaſons of the year. Like the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles, it is an eruptive diſeaſe, of the ſtenic ſpecies ſpecifically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, and evidently depending on the ſame general cauſe, though on different temporary or local cauſes. Inoculation has nearly baniſhed this from the liſt of epidemics.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a common error that this diſeaſe never originates without contagion. Before the art of inoculation, it was an epidemic in large cities, appearing and diſappearing with as much regularity and certainty as the meaſles. I can name many inſtances of its originating in this country without contagion or infection, and I have the authority of many old practitioners of medicin for the fact. It moſt uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in thoſe years which manifeſt a diſpoſition to produce other erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſeaſes.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But a more formidable epidemic, and perhaps the moſt formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to which the human race is expoſed, is the angina, uſing this word to denote all the different kinds of affections of the throat. I call it the moſt formidable, becauſe hitherto no means have been diſcovered of arreſting its progreſs. Its horrors and fatality are not mitigated by inoculation, like thoſe of the ſmall-pox, nor are its uſual ravages limited to populous towns, like thoſe of the plague. Under all aſpects, therefore, I conſider it as a far more dreadful diſeaſe than either, becauſe the others may be mitigated or avoided.</p>
                  <p>Affections of the throat, either in the form of ſcarlatina angi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſa, angina maligna, cynanche trachealis, &amp;c. are among the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics which belong to almoſt every peſtilential period. In the order of appearance they have not one uniform place; but in America, anginas have uſually ſucceeded catarrh, the firſt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year, and continued to the fourth or fifth. In the three laſt epidemic periods, this order has been very uniform. I ſpeak of epidemic angina which ſpreads over the whole country; for in particular places we hear of it almoſt every year.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſeaſes in our large cities have been ſucceeded by the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:036687_0424_100AA3EBA37F5F30"/>
bilious plague, and in the country, by violent remittents, typhus fevers and dyſentery.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes angina prevails without being followed by the plague: That is, the conſtitution of air terminates at that point of its peſtilential progreſs. Such ſeems to have been the fact with the angina of 1755. And in all caſes in which it is of a mild kind, or not univerſal, ſtrong hopes may be entertained, that no plague will follow it. The epidemic anginas from 1783 to 1786, were of this kind.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the univerſality of the cauſe of theſe epidemics, it is to be obſerved, that it is of two kinds—ſometimes it extends to both hemiſpheres, at other times it ſeems to be limited to one. Thoſe diſeaſes, however, which are leaſt influenced by heat or cold, or which depend moſt on ſome inviſible ſtate of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, appear moſt frequently in both hemiſpheres, at the ſame time. This fact, with reſpect to the catarrh, has been particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noticed.</p>
                  <p>The ſame fact is obſervable very often with reſpect to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles, and eſpecially with regard to anginas. Theſe affections of the throat, when violent, are nearly cotemporary in Europe and America. Witneſs the periods from 1751 to 1756—from 1773 to 1776—1783 to 1786—from 1793 to 1796, and in 1742.</p>
                  <p>This cotemporaneouſneſs of certain epidemic diſeaſes, in both hemiſpheres, is an important fact which has hitherto been little noticed, but which opens a new field for philoſophical inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It demonſtrates that ſuch diſeaſes are occaſioned ſolely by a conſtitution of air, without the influence of contagion, although when the diſeaſes are formed, they are contagious.</p>
                  <p>But we have further facts of a ſimilar nature. It is obſervable that the peſtilential principle often extends from Egypt, Syria and Turkey, over all Europe and to America. But the ſame diſeaſes, that is, the ſame forms of the peſtilence, do not always appear in Egypt or Turkey, and in France, England and America, in the ſame year. It is a general fact, that the worſt form of peſtilence, the inguinal plague, appears firſt in Cairo, Smyrna or Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople; and from this circumſtance, the advocates for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of that diſeaſe by ſpecific contagion, have drawn their moſt
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:036687_0425_100AA429E46BD658"/>
powerful arguments in ſupport of their theory. But this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is founded on a view of the ſubject, moſt miſerably narrow and obſcure.</p>
                  <p>In every peſtilential period, there is a ſeries of epidemic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The order in which they appear depends on local or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary circumſtances. Thus in Grand Cairo or Conſtantinople, the climate or the ſtrong local cauſes, ſpeedily bring the peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial principle to its criſis, in the production of the plague. For this reaſon, that diſeaſe appears in thoſe cities, ſome time <hi>before</hi> it does in northern latitudes or in more healthy cities.</p>
                  <p>But at the very time the plague appears in Conſtantinople or Cairo, ſome lighter epidemic diſeaſe, belonging to the ſeries, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in other parts of the world, indicating the approach of peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence. Thus, in 1580 and 81, Cairo was deſolated by a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous plague; but, at the ſame time, a ſevere epidemic catarrh burſt forth on all Europe, the certain forerunner of peſtilential fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and which, in that inſtance, was ſucceeded by plague in 1582 and 3, as far north as England. Let facts within late pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, decide this queſtion.</p>
                  <p>The plague appeared in the Turkiſh dominions in 1718, but in 1719 became more general. In 1718 the bills of mortality were conſiderably ſwelled in Amſterdam, London and Vienna, but in 1719 they roſe, in the two former cities, conſiderably higher—the peſtilential ſtate of air pervading the moſt of Europe. I have no account of the ſtate of diſeaſes in Marſeilles, in 1718; but in 1719 appeared a peſtilential fever, which increaſed the mortality, altho the peſtilential principle did not riſe to its height till the ſubſequent year.</p>
                  <p>In this period, cotemporary with the plague in the Levant, was a univerſal increaſe of mortality in Europe, and the ſame ſtate of air was experienced in America, altho, in very few parts of Europe, did the peſtilential principle ariſe to the degree of plague.</p>
                  <p>In 1726 we again hear of the plague in Egypt, and for two or three years ſucceeding, the bills of mortality were ſwelled in Europe and America. Of the epidemics that prevailed in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, I regret my want of information.—I only know that meaſles and malignant pleuriſy prevailed in this country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="unknown:036687_0426_100AA3ED2D15AFE0"/>In 1735 and 6 raged the moſt deſolating ſore throat in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and at the ſame time, the moſt fatal plague in Egypt, that has appeared in this century. This peſtilence, like that in the time of Thucydides, took its riſe in the interior parts of Egypt or Ethiopia. And it muſt not be overlooked that the violence of the peſtilence in Egypt correſponded with that of the ſore throat in America—a fact which, as far as I can diſcover, is gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally true, that the more fatal the epidemics that prevail over one quarter of the globe, the more violent are the ſame or other peſtilential diſeaſes, in the other hemiſphere. It makes little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that in one country rages the glandular plague, and in another the petechial fever or putrid ſore throat—Theſe are only different forms of peſtilence, the <hi>effects of one common cauſe, modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by local cauſes.</hi> The great point is, that ſuch epidemics are <hi>cotemporary in countries the moſt remote.</hi> Slight epidemics may appear alone, but never the more ſevere and deadly forms of peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence; excepting perhaps dyſentery, or ſome other complaints that depend moſtly on the ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>The years 1740-41 and 42 were alſo peſtilential. At what time the plague of this period firſt appeared in the eaſt, I am not informed. But it raged in Syria from 1742 to 1744, and it rarely happens, that it is not a year or two earlier in Egypt or Conſtantinople, than in Syria. Cotemporary with the plague of this period was great mortality in London and Amſterdam from the petechial fever, which fell but little ſhort of the plague. See the bills.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, raged in America a ſeries of epidemics, particularly meaſles, anginas and the bilious plague; the latter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in Philadelphia and Virginia in 1741, and in N. York in 1743, the ſame year with the dreadful peſtilence in Meſſina.</p>
                  <p>The year 1755, the year of a great plague in Conſtantinople, was diſtinguiſhed for catarrh in Europe, and ſore throat both in Europe and America.</p>
                  <p>In 1758 commenced the peſtilential period, which was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and felt in both hemiſpheres, in ſome one or all of the years from 1758 to 1763. Here, it is obſervable, our information is more correct. In 1758, cotemporary with the beginning of this
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:036687_0427_100AA42C53098518"/>
peſtilence, was an epidemic catarrh in Europe. Then followed other epidemics of a more malignant type. During this peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial period appeared in America, the catarrh and meaſles, and the plague in Philadelphia in 1762; but eſpecially the fatal epidemic pleuriſy in 1761.</p>
                  <p>The next period commenced in 1769 or 1770, in which the plague ſpread over the eaſt. This period was begun by meaſles and anginas, if my information is correct, in 1769—catarrh was epidemic in 1771 and 2, and in the latter year meaſles of a bad type. Then followed angina, and the epidemics all cloſed in dyſenteries. The plague in the Levant was cotemporary with the commencement of this period.</p>
                  <p>I am not informed of the preciſe time when the plague of the next period commenced in the Levant, but it was raging in 1783 and 4, during the prevalence of meaſles and angina in America.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt period, the plague in Egypt was very violent, about the time the mortality commenced in America. Of the preciſe time when it began in Egypt I am not informed; but it prevailed in 1791, the year it appeared in New-York and Grenada, and was moſt deſtructive the following year, 1792, the year when the ſcarlatina firſt appeared in the northern parts of America.</p>
                  <p>I have no further accounts of the plague in Egypt, but the public prints have informed us, the diſeaſe prevailed in Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople in 1797, and was more general in the Turkiſh dominions in 1798, the moſt fatal year in America.</p>
                  <p>The reader will be pleaſed to remark, that when I ſpeak of the plague in Grand Cairo or Conſtantinople, I refer only to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent and deſtructive epidemics. The plague, in a light form, and in a few caſes, occurs almoſt annually in thoſe great cities, where the common cauſes and ordinary ſeaſons are adequate to its production in particular conſtitutions. But, let me obſerve, that no extenſive and deſolating plague ever ravages either of thoſe cities, except under the influence of general contagion, or an epidemic ſtate of air, which is experienced, nearly at the ſame time, in Europe and America.</p>
                  <p>Theſe facts enable us to ſolve the whole difficulty which has puzzled phyſicians, in regard to the different kinds of yellow
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:036687_0428_100AA3F0AE356820"/>
fever, which appear, at different periods, in the Weſt-Indies. The ſimple truth, is, that in ordinary ſeaſons, when no peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial conſtitution of air exiſts, the fever of the Weſt-Indies, is not contagious. It attacks ſtrangers with violence and deſtroys life, but is not communicable <hi>per ſe.</hi> Hence the authors who have written on the ſubject are correct, in aſſerting this ordinary fever, not to be contagious.</p>
                  <p>But after catarrh has pervaded the hemiſphere, and during the increaſe of mortality in the Levant, in Europe and on the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican continent; that is, during a peſtilential ſtate of air, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Weſt-Indies aſſumes double malignity, and becomes contagious. In years of health, the diſeaſe rarely attacks natives of the iſlands; but in unhealthy periods, not only native whites, but even blacks are ſometimes affected with the diſeaſe. Among theſe however it is leſs deſtructive.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſolve the problem which has embarraſſed all the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical writers on the yellow fever, the moſt able of whom have been compelled to declare that the fever in the Iſlands is ſometimes contagious, and at other times, not.</p>
                  <p>This view of the ſubject would have prevented the trouble of authors who have labored to prove the diſeaſe imported from Siam, or the African coaſt.—Dr. Chiſholm, inſtead of attempting to trace the Grenada fever of 1793 to Africa, through the ſhip Hankey, had only to remark, the prevalence of the catarrh in 1790, of the plague in Egypt in 1791, and of the ſcarlatina in the United States in 1793, and he would have ſeen the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a moſt extenſive and malignant ſeries of diſeaſes. The truth is, the peſtilential ſtate of air firſt manifeſted itſelf in Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada in 1791, [the year it commenced in New-York] by new and ſingular ſymptoms, which ſurpriſed Dr. Chiſholm. And this, by the way, was before the beginning of the preſent war, on the part of Great-Britain, and of courſe, it could not be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to that circumſtance. The ſame fact, when juſtly conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, is demonſtration, that the diſeaſe was not brought from Africa.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be remarked however, that the fever of the tropical
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:036687_0429_100AA42DDAFC37E8"/>
climates, though not contagious in ſporadic caſes, in healthful years, may at any time become epidemic and contagious, under certain circumſtances. Thus large bodies of ſoldiers and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, paſſing ſuddenly from high northern latitudes into the Weſt-Indies, may contract the diſeaſe, and render it ſo virulent by crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded camps and ſhips, as to render it very infectious. This is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the caſe in wars between England and France, which call great numbers of men from Great-Britain into the iſlands.</p>
                  <p>Yet even in this caſe, the mortality of the diſeaſe is increaſed by a peſtilential ſtate of air, concurring with ſuch local cauſes. Such was the ſtate of air from 1760 to 1763, during which the Britiſh and American troops periſhed before Havanna. Such alſo has been the ſtate of air for eight years paſt, in which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Britiſh troops in the iſlands has been unparralleled.</p>
                  <p>This circumſtance has led a reſpectable college of phyſicians in Philadelphia, to inſinuate that war is a cauſe of the diſeaſe. Their words are, "it exiſts in the Weſt-Indies, particularly in time of war, when great numbers of ſtrangers are to be found there, and reference to dates will ſhow, that in <hi>moſt</hi> of the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the occurrence of the diſeaſe in the United States, there has been war in the Weſt-Indies." Memorial to the Legiſlature of Pennſylvania, Dec. 5, 1797.</p>
                  <p>This aſſertion, however, is not authorized by facts. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable plague in Philadelphia and Charleſton in 1699, was in time of peace. That in New-York in 1702 was in the firſt year of a war, but could not have been derived from that circumſtance, in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
                  <p>The ſame diſeaſe at Barbadoes and Martinico, in 1723, was in time of peace, in Charleſton in 1728, in time of peace—at Carthagena the next year, in time of peace—at Charleſton and New-York in 1732, in time of peace—at Barbadoes in 1738 and 1764, in time of peace. The inſtances which happened between 1740 and 48, were in time of war, as was that in Philadelphia in 1762. The preſent war has exhibited melancholy effects of diſeaſes in the Weſt-Indies; but it is an indubitable fact that the plague of the preſent period commenced in 1791, a year before the war, and before numerous reinforcements of troops had been
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:036687_0430_100AA3F46EFA0428"/>
ſent to the iſlands. It muſt further be obſerved, that during the eight years war between America and Great-Britain, no yellow fever appeared in the United States! a ſtriking fact.</p>
                  <p>It is certainly a moſt unfortunate circumſtance for the credit of the college of phyſicians, that the longeſt interval of peace during the preſent century, from the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, to the Spaniſh war of 1740, includes in it the longeſt and moſt ſevere ſtate of peſtilential diſeaſes, in Europe, Africa, America and the Iſlands, that has occurred, during the century. A ſimple in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of the bills of mortality, during that period, will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the fact!</p>
                  <p>One thing, however, may be aſſerted with truth, that whatever may be the extent and violence of the bilious plague in the Weſt-Indies, it never has appeared in the northern parts of the United States, except in periods when a peſtilential or ſickly ſtate of the air is manifeſted by the prevalence of other epidemics. In tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical climates and in the ſouthern parts of America, particular circumſtances, as great bodies of freſh troops from northern lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, or unfavorable ſeaſons, may generate the diſeaſe in any year, however healthy in temperate latitudes. But from Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land northward, this American plague has never appeared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being preceded by other epidemics. Let facts be reſorted to for confirmation.</p>
                  <p>We read of malignant diſeaſes in America, anterior to the year 1699, but the order of them is not deſcribed. The fatal plague of that year was preceded by epidemic catarrh, and the plague raged, at the ſame time, in the Levant. The ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in New-York in 1702, belongs to the ſame period, which ſeems to have commenced in 1697 and ended in 1702.</p>
                  <p>The next ſickly period was from 1709 to 1713, beginning in Europe with the ſevere catarrh of 1709, which was followed by plague in the Baltic towns, in Hungary, Vienna, &amp;c. accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a moſt deſolating ſickneſs among horned cattle and horſes, in Germany and Italy. Of the effects of this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of air, in America, I have but two inſtances, which were a moſt diſtreſſing ſickneſs in Waterbury, in Connecticut, which almoſt depopulated the town, and epidemic meaſles in 1712.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="unknown:036687_0431_100AA42F81E9C6D0"/>Of the next peſtilential period, about 1720, I have alſo but two inſtances in America; the mortality at Duck creek, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready related, and the malignant pleuriſy in Hartford.</p>
                  <p>The plague in Philadelphia and Virginia in 1741, and in New-York in 1743, was preceded by the uſual epidemics, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenza, meaſles, angina, &amp;c. and at the ſame time the plague was raging in the Levant and in Sicily.</p>
                  <p>The ſame diſeaſe in Philadelphia in 1762 had its uſual precur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, meaſles and catarrh, and this occurred during the prevalence of the plague, in the Levant.</p>
                  <p>I hardly need to mention, in proof, the preſent epidemics. It is well known, we have paſſed through the whole ſeries of precurſors, catarrh, ſcarlatina, meaſles, &amp;c. the two former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far more general and ſevere than uſual, indicated, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty, the violence and extent of the plague which was to follow.</p>
                  <p>From a long ſeries of facts, then, we demonſtrate that the plague of our climate depends on ſome <hi>general cauſe.</hi> And it muſt abaſh and confound the ſticklers for the propagation of this diſeaſe from country to country by fomes, to know that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe never occurs in the temperate latitudes of America, except under a peſtilential conſtitution of air, manifeſted by other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant diſeaſes in this country, which are certainly <hi>not</hi> imported, and during alſo the prevalence of ſimilar diſeaſes in the Levant, and an increaſe of mortality in other countries. It muſt ſtill more confound theſe perſons, if they have any ſuſceptibility of conviction, to obſerve that theſe very peſtilential diſeaſes, inſtead of being conveyed from place to place, appear at one and the ſame time in Egypt, Turkey, the Weſt-Indies, and in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States. This is very common, and probably is always the fact.</p>
                  <p>If the peſtilence were introduced into this country, from the iſlands, and if the diſeaſe is capable of being propagated as an epidemic, from fomes, why, let me aſk, has it never been prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated in the United States, in healthy periods? It has been <hi>imported</hi> probably in hundreds of inſtances, from the iſlands, ever ſince the commencement of the Weſt-India trade.</p>
                  <p>Not a year paſſed from 1763 to 1791, in which multitudes of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:036687_0432_100AA3F5F88F62A8"/>
ſeamen or peſſengers were not brought into the United States, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to large and ſmall towns, and into hoſpitals filled with patients, with the yellow fever upon them and all their infected clothing. Yet in all this long period, no contagion appeared, altho no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions, at leaſt in many parts of the country, were ever taken to prevent it. If the diſeaſe contains ſpecific contagion, ſurely that contagion muſt take effect under all circumſtances. Every man knows that the variolous matter of the ſmall-pox regards neither time nor place; its contagion acts in all years, ſeaſons and climates, tho not with equal certainty.</p>
                  <p>This fact alone, that the bilious plague never ſhows itſelf in the temperate latitudes of America, except when the current epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics of this country, manifeſt a general conſtitution of air, unfriendly to health, is ſufficient to explain all the difficulties that have occured to medical men and to others, on the ſubject of the origin and peculiar ſymptoms of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Some of theſe remarks are in anticipation of the ſubject of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſection, but they fall naturally enough under this head, the deſign of which is, to eſtabliſh the doctrin of the univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of certain diſeaſes, at particular times, occaſioned by a cauſe or cauſes extending often over a whole hemiſphere, and ſometimes over the earth.—That ſuch is the fact, is demonſtrated by the hiſtory of epidemics, from the earlieſt ages to this day. A ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive ſeries of ſimilar facts, occurring age after age, leave no room for cavil or controverſy.</p>
                  <p>I have confined my remarks, on this head, to the lateſt periods of the world, becauſe the evidence is more complete. But a ſimple inſpection of the preceding hiſtory, will convince any can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did perſon, that the phenomena of peſtilence have been uniform, from the higheſt antiquity. In the moſt barbarous ages, when commerce was unknown, all the ſevere plagues appeared in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every part of the earth, in high northern latitudes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſavage tribes which had no intercourſe with the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean. The cuſtom of deriving all plagues from Egypt, Syria or Turkey by ſpecific contagion, is modern—it is pointedly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by all hiſtory—is unworthy of the enlightened period in which it has been advanced—and marks an extreme degeneration in philoſophy.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XV. Of the phenomena which attend peſtilential periods, with conjectures concerning the cauſes.</head>
                  <p>IT will not eſcape the moſt inattentive reader of the foregoing hiſtory, that all the violent and general plagues have been prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or accompanied with remarkable phenomena in the phyſical world, as comets, earthquakes, exploſions of volcanoes, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a ſubordinate kind.</p>
                  <p>We are to admit, with great caution, the influence of the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets in producing the calamitous diſeaſes which at periods afflict mankind. It is an influence very uncertain and undefinable. It is not indeed unphiloſophical to ſuppoſe, the ſeveral immenſe orbs that compoſe the ſolar ſyſtem, to have an influence on each other by means of the great laws of attraction and repulſion. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſuppoſition would be moſt unphiloſophical. But it might be very difficult to aſcertain preciſely what that influence is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it might not be poſſible to ſeparate its effects from thoſe which are produced by other cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The ancients went much too far in aſcribing events on this earth to planetary influence. They aſcribed not only natural, but moral effects to that influence, and by their extravagant ſyſtem of judicial aſtrology, brought into contempt the ſtudy of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of heavenly bodies.</p>
                  <p>We are not however to diſcard all conſiderations of ſuch an influence. We are naturally led to ſuppoſe that all parts of our ſyſtem are connected by principles of attraction, and that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain order and equilibrium are neceſſary to keep all parts in due harmony. It is very obvious that the moon has a moſt material influence in regulating the ſeaſons and changes of weather on this
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:036687_0434_100AA3F928127410"/>
globe, eſpecially the weekly and monthly viciſſitudes. The more diſtant bodies may have a ſimilar effect, tho leſs obvious.</p>
                  <p>Comets, which approach and enter the ſolar ſyſtem at certain unequal periods, may alſo have ſome influence upon the ſeaſons. To aſcertain this point, I have collected all the information my reading has enabled me to diſcover.</p>
                  <p>The ancients believed theſe bodies to be the cauſes or at leaſt the harbingers of peſtilence; according to that line of Claudian</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"In coelo nunquam ſpectatum impuné cometam."</l>
                     <l>"A comet in the heavens is never beheld with impunity."</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>But ſhould the fact be admitted, it might be ſtill a ſubject of enquiry, by what means theſe erratic bodies injure the health of mankind. That they have ſome effect of this kind, ſeems to be very probable, not only from the opinion of the ancients who were careful in their obſervations, but from the very uniform co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidence of their appearance with extenſive peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that comets have a very ſenſible effect on the weather. This was obſerved as long ago as the days of Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle, who remarks, Meteorol. lib. 1. ca. 7. "That comets denote great tides and winds." He inſtances the ſwell of the ſea when Achaia was inundated, which was during the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a comet. Pliny makes a ſimilar obſervation. "Ventos autem ab iis graves aeſtuſque ſignifica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i." Nat. Hiſt. lib. 2. ca. 25. Seneca was of the ſame opinion, and he mentions ſtorms of rain alſo among the effects of their approach. Seneca, Nat. Quſt. lib. 7. ſect. 28.</p>
                  <p>It is true that great heat and drouth, and violent tempeſts mark the periods of the approach of comets, and it is equally true that the winters of the ſame periods are remarkably cold. Ariſtotle himſelf mentions the cold of the winter, during the appearance of the great comet, when Ariſtaeus was archon at Athens.</p>
                  <p>The preceding relation of facts furniſhes a confirmation of theſe opinions. All the comets which have approached this earth, in their paſſage to or from the ſun, eſpecially thoſe which have paſſed very near us, have been preceded, attended and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by moſt extraordinary effects, as great heat and drouth,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:036687_0435_100AA43419D8CA70"/>
in ſummer, and ſevere cold in winter; deluging rains, violent tempeſts and unuſual tides. Theſe we may conſider as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and certain attendants on comets. They occur ſo uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the appearance of thoſe bodies, and for ſome months preceding and following, as to leave no room to queſtion the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from which they proceed.</p>
                  <p>Through the medium of ſuch great changes in the ſeaſons, we may rationally ſuppoſe comets muſt affect the health of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Extreme and unuſual heat ſeldom fails to produce a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of autumnal diſeaſes, as may be ſeen by the bills of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and as the obſervations of every perſon can verify.</p>
                  <p>It is obvious from the foregoing hiſtory, that one of the moſt certain effects of the approximation of a comet, is, a moſt ſevere winter. The almoſt uniform coincidence of theſe two phenon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena leaves us no room to doubt their connection. Now it is a law of the ſeaſons, that the mean temperature of the air is nearly the ſame every year. This has been proved by ſeven years ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made at Salem by Dr. Holyoke, and publiſhed in the firſt part of the ſecond volume of the Memoirs of the American Academy. Whenever therefore the cold of winter is long or ſevere in an unuſual degree, it muſt be counterbalanced, in the ſucceeding ſeaſons, by an extraordinary degree of heat. This may happen to be effected by long mild weather in ſpring and autumn; but it is more uſual, that ſevere winters are followed by exceſſive heat in the ſummer months. In this caſe, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body never fails to ſuffer. In ſuch ſummers, bilious fevers and dyſenteries are commonly numerous and violent.</p>
                  <p>If therefore comets do in fact produce unuſually cold winters, which are neceſſarily preceded or followed by exceſſively hot ſummers, they may be conſidered as the remote cauſe of nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>But comets do moſt evidently occaſion at times exceſſive drouth; and at other times, extraordinary quantities of rain; and theſe intemperate ſeaſons not unfrequently ſucceed each other within a few months. No man can queſtion this fact, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the preceding hiſtory. All ſuch unuſual ſeaſons are apt to injure the vegetable kingdom. In too dry ſeaſons, corn may
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:036687_0436_100AA3FAAF58C210"/>
be defective in quantity; in too wet weather, it is deficient in nouriſhing qualities; and in both caſes, it may contain the germs of epidemic diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>That comets ſhould affect the health of mankind in any other way, than through the means of the ſeaſons or weather, is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but is not to be admitted without moſt indiſputable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It is indeed certain that the oriental nations believe, and have, from high antiquity, believed theſe bodies to be the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of plagues; and the enumeration of facts in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hiſtory, evidently confirms their opinions. That hiſtory is probably defective in accounts of comets; but imperfect as it is, it affords proof that moſt of the plagues which have been exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and ſevere, have been preceded or attended with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of comets.</p>
                  <p>From numerous facts in the hiſtory of peſtilence, I am led to ſuſpect that comets have ſome effect on the fire or electricity which ſurrounds and penetrates this globe. One of the moſt certain, as well as moſt remarkable phenomena, which attend plagues, is, earthquakes; and in general, the more ſevere or numerous have been the earthquakes, the more violent and deſtructive the plagues. This remark applies to moſt of the countries in Europe, where the plague has been epidemic; but is more eſpecially true of Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the Syrian coaſt, with the whole of Aſia Minor.</p>
                  <p>In confirmation of this remark, we need not reſort to facts in ancient times, when earthquakes ſeem to have been more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and violent, than in modern times. Within the preſent century, the ſhocks which have uniformly attended peſtilence, leave no room to queſtion that ſome connection exiſts between the two phenomena.</p>
                  <p>Now it is a fact that will appear from an inſpection of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding hiſtory, that, during the approximation of comets to our ſyſtem, earthquakes have been moſt numerous, general and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. A great proportion of the tremendous eruptions of volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes have happened during the ſame periods. To prove this, we need not go back to the terrible concuſſions and violent diſcharge of Etna, which cloſed the long peſtilence in Athens, in the fifth
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:036687_0437_100AA43729D4C550"/>
and ſixth year of the Pelopponeſian war—nor to the dreadful earthquakes and eruption, which preceded the deſtructive plague in the reign of Titus. We have ſimilar facts in modern times. The plagues in the Levant in 1743, and eſpecially in Meſſina, were accompanied or preceded by violent earthquakes and a comet. The extenſive plague of 1760, was attended with all the great phenomena—comets, eruption of Veſuvius and tremendous earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes. The peſtilential periods of 1770 and 1783, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the ſame phenomena.</p>
                  <p>Theſe facts afford ſtrong evidence that the approach of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, not only influences the weather, but alſo calls into action the ſubterranean fires. By what means thoſe erratic bodies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this effect, may be a curious queſtion. That the internal fires explode at times, without the attractive powers of comets, is undoubted; but the concurrence of earthquakes and violent diſcharges from volcanoes, during the appearance of comets, or near the time, ſeems to render it certain that thoſe bodies have a moſt powerful effect on the element of fire which is diffuſed through the globe and the ſurrounding atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>Many authors have obſerved the connection between comets, earthquakes and peſtilence, but ſeem not to have included vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canic eruptions among the cauſes of diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>"In coelo per quindecem dies apparens crinitum ſidus ſiccatis plane terris attulerat; ſays Paulus Jovius; peſtilentia quoque contagiis ſerpens, et in urbe et in Caſtris." Hiſt. vol. 2. 111.</p>
                  <p>This obſervation of the writer is well founded—comets ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fail to occaſion a univerſal defect of rain and ſprings in ſome countries, and peſtilence marches in the train with its other effects.</p>
                  <p>"Inter prognoſtica peſtis eſt etiam cometes, jaculum et aliae ſigurae ardentes, diutius in ſuprema aeris regione ſubſiſtentes." Horſtius from Angelus Sala, de peſte, p. 253.</p>
                  <p>Theſe remarks alſo are juſtified by our own obſervations. They were remarkably verified in the comet, the meteor and the brilliant halo which marked the commencement of the laſt ſeries of epidemics in 1788 and 1789.</p>
                  <p>Riverius is expreſs to the ſame point. He aſſerts that comets
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:036687_0438_100AA3FCE1765090"/>
never appear without being followed by epidemic and peſtilent diſeaſes, and various changes in the phyſical world. He inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that of 1618, in his own days. The obſervation is verified by the teſtimony of all ancient writers and by a uniform ſeries of modern facts.</p>
                  <p>The order of events is exemplified in the epidemic periods of 1769—and of 1782. In the firſt period, exceſſive drouth du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the approach of the comet in 1769—failure of crops—fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and plague and inſects in 1770—volcanoes, earthquakes and tempeſts in 1770 and 1771—catarrh and meaſles in 1772—then, for ſeveral years, anginas, putrid fevers and dyſenteries.</p>
                  <p>In the period of 1781 and 2, catarrh began the epidemics— in 1782 a univerſal failure of water, and of crops in India and Egypt—in 1783, volcano, famin, meaſles, angina and plague— 1784 a comet, followed by tempeſts, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Earthquakes conſtitute a part of the viſible effects of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral cauſe which produces peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>It has ſometimes happened that in theſe convulſions of the earth, a vapor has been extricated which has produced immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate diſeaſe. The great earthquake in South-America in 1730 was ſpeedily followed by a peſtilential fever. The deſtruction of Port-Royal in Jamaica in 1692 was ſoon ſucceeded by a mortal fever in all parts of the iſland; and the univerſality of the fever would lead us to ſuſpect that vapor, in this inſtance, could not have been the cauſe. At Venice in 1343, the plague ſoon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed an earthquake.</p>
                  <p>In the year 615, violent earthquakes in Italy were followed by "lues elephantiae." Baronius, vol. 8. 243. Baglivus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that the great earthquakes in Italy in 1703, were ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by numerous diſeaſes, eſpecially opthalmia, eryſipelas, meſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teric fevers and double tertians. In autumn, the ſmall-pox be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came epidemic, apoplexies were frequent and ſudden deaths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt daily. With reſpect to apoplexies and ſudden deaths after earthquakes, we have alſo the authority of Seneca.</p>
                  <p>Baglivus further remarks "poſt terraemotus frequenter ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedunt peſtilentia, vel morbi graves et epidemici, imo nova et inaudita morborum genera." p. 530. The idea that new and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:036687_0439_100AA439CDD44880"/>
unknown ſpecies of diſeaſes follow earthquakes, if well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ounded, leads us to ſuſpect that the changes in the characters of diſeaſes are attributable to the various action of the electrical fluid.</p>
                  <p>The terribly deſtructive earthquakes in Naples and Sicily in 1693, were ſpeedily followed by malignant fevers, tertians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with delirium and lethargy, and the ſmall-pox which was very fatal to children.</p>
                  <bibl>Baddam's Mem. vol. 3. 91.</bibl>
                  <p>"Frequent earthquakes, ſays Fracaſtorius de contagione, p. 136, announce future peſtilence, and by means of exhalations, tend to produce it." Van Swieten agrees in this opinion.</p>
                  <p>Seneca aſſerts, Nat. Queſt. art. 27, that peſtilential diſeaſes uſually follow great earthquakes. He ſuppoſes the air, encloſed in the earth, to become vitiated, either by ſtagnation or through the defect of the internal fires "internorum ignium vitio." He thinks this air when forced into the atmoſphere, renders it impure and unwholeſome, generating new kinds of diſeaſes. He reaſons by analogy that as water corrupts by ſtagnation, ſo will air. Hence after earthquakes, "ſubitae continuaeque mortes et monſtroſa genera morborum, ut ex novis orta cauſis—nec prius peſtilentia definit, quam ſpiritum illum gravem exercuit laxitas coeli, ventorum jactatio."</p>
                  <p>This opinion of Seneca is certainly entitled to reſpect, and has been followed by many diſtinguiſhed authors, Van Helmont, Van Swieten, Sydenham, Hodges, Baglivus and others.</p>
                  <p>But I ſuſpect the modern diſcoveries will enable us to furniſh a more rational ſolution of the phenomenon. I am inclined to believe that a ſuperabundant ſtimulus, occaſioned by the ſhock of an earthquake, and an atmoſphere ſurcharged with electricity, will more rationally account for the apoplexies, ſudden deaths, ſmall-pox and malignant fevers. If a deleterious vapor were the cauſe, I ſhould ſuppoſe its effects would be ſpeedy, and its force ſoon expended, the atmoſphere being ſpeedily purified by winds. But, if ſtimulus is the cauſe, it may exiſt for a long time in the atmoſphere, and the human body not yield to its force in many weeks or months. This would better accord with facts, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho diſeaſes appear ſoon after an earthquake, yet the worſt effects are often many months or a year after, as was the caſe in the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:036687_0440_100AA3FE692562E0"/>
reign of Titus, when the peſtilence was the year after the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake and eruption of Veſuvius.</p>
                  <p>There are however many authorities in favor of the vapor. Seneca relates that a vapor cauſed by an earthquake in Campania, deſtroyed ſix hundred ſheep. Van Helmont ſays that "popular plagues do draw their firſt occaſional matter from an earthquake." Page 1125.</p>
                  <p>The fact that a viſible vapor, without an earthquake, ſometimes appears ſuddenly in a place and evidently produces diſeaſe, is a ſtrong confirmation of Seneca's opinion. A memorable example happened at Rouen, in 1753, as related under that year. Foreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus relates that an epidemic catarrh or ſore throat, in Alemar, A. D. 1557, ſuddenly invaded 2000 perſons, of whom 200 died. He aſcribes it to a vapor, for the diſeaſe was preceded by thick clouds of an ill ſmell.</p>
                  <bibl>See Van Swieten, vol. 16. p. 31.</bibl>
                  <p>Mazeray relates that the black peſtilence of 1347 aroſe in Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na from a vapor, which burſt from the earth with a ſmell moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly offenſive. This fact is cited by Boyle vol. 5. 60. in proof that peſtilential diſeaſes ſpring from vapors evolved from the earth. This author ſuppoſes new diſeaſes may be generated by vapors, and remarks further that countries abounding with cinnabar eſcape the plague.</p>
                  <p>But it ſeldom happens that peſtilential diſeaſes can be traced directly to earthquakes. On the other hand, altho great plagues are almoſt invariably accompanied with ſhocks of the earth, yet it more uſually happens that the peſtilence appears before the concuſſion. Thus the ſhocks which alarmed and laid waſte Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in 1348, 1349 and 1350, were preceded by the dreadful plague of 1347.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the earthquakes precede the plague, but more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally the peſtilence appears firſt, or at leaſt the petechial or oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er malignant fever, which marks the commencement of the peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence. Thus the plague of 1760 was preceded by a ſpotted fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in 1759, which marked the approach of the calamity; which ſpotted fever appeared in Syria, <hi>before</hi> the terrible earthquakes of that period.</p>
                  <p>In the well known plague at Oczakow in 1738 and 39, an
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:036687_0441_100AA43C78A7FB88"/>
earthquake happened about the time the diſeaſe began to abate. Van Swieten, vol. 16. 47. Such was the fact in the days of Thucydides. Numerous obſervations on theſe phenomena lead me to ſuſpect, that the electricity which is to produce the explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is in action for a conſiderable time <hi>before</hi> the ſhock, and that it is this <hi>previous action</hi> which occaſions epidemic diſeaſes. That is, the ſtimulus of fire or electricity produces ſenſible effects on the bodies of animals the more ſuſceptible objects, before it does on the leſs ſuſceptible ſubſtances in the bowels of the earth.</p>
                  <p>The earthquakes do not always occur in the ſeat of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. I find no concuſſion mentioned to have happened at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in 1665, or in the years next preceding or following; but ſhocks were experienced in the neighboring counties in 1665, and 1666.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems to have miſled the able Diemerbroeck, who, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning on the cauſes of the plague, objects to the influence of earthquakes, becauſe no ſhocks occurred at Nimeguen, before the peſtilence of 1636. It is probably true that earthquakes are not uſually the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the plague; but that they have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the cauſe, I can hardly doubt. The miſtakes of Diemerbroeck and others on this point ſeem to have ariſen from conſidering the plague as an iſolated diſeaſe, and as depending on a cauſe local and temporary; whereas a juſt view of the ſubject muſt comprehend all the diſeaſes of increaſed malignity which precede the plague, very often for two or three years. Such a view alſo muſt include, among the cauſes of the diſeaſe, the agitations or derangement of the elements in remote parts of the country. Thus, altho no earthquake was experienced at Nime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen, about the time of the plague, yet a ſevere ſhock was felt at Lauſanne in 1634.—Keyſler's travels 190. This marked ſome general action of internal fire, which, tho it might not explode ſo as to ſhake all Germany, might have produced effects, by means of an inſenſible vapor or ſtimulus, in all parts of Europe. Certain it is, that for the period between 1631, the year of the tremendous eruption of Veſuvius, and the year 1637, all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope was afflicted with mortal epidemics. The philoſopher who would obtain juſt views of the cauſes, muſt extend his inquiries to
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:036687_0442_100AA4002F4499E8"/>
all the great phenomena, which occurred during this whole peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, in all Europe at leaſt, if not in the American hemiſphere; for ſuch a view only will comprehend the whole extent of the peſtilential ſtate of the atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be forgotten, that during this period from 1633 to 1637, when the plague or other deſolating diſeaſes, ſpread over both hemiſpheres, Etna was in a continual ſtate of eruption; as it was for fifteen years, during the peſtilential conſtitutions deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by Sydenham in his days.</p>
                  <p>In looking over the liſt of comets, and the hiſtory of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, I am compelled to believe the approach of comets to have no ſmall influence on the electricity and ſubterranean fires of the globe. Such a vaſtly great proportion of the violent concuſſions of the earth have happened, within a few months of the appearance of comets, that no reaſonable man can ſuppoſe the coincidences to be the reſult of accident.</p>
                  <p>Equally remarkable have been the coincidences in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the appearance of comets and the exploſions of volcanoes. And this fact is no trifling confirmation of my opinion, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the influence of comets in producing earthquakes; for earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes are often cotemporane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>It is not only during the <hi>appearance</hi> of comets, that their effects are perceived in the elements, but for many months <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after.</hi> I can teſtify from careful obſervations that the effects of that in Auguſt 1797, were very obvious, in anomalous tides, as early as the laſt week in May; and the inundations in England during the autumn and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following, ſhow its effects ſeveral months after its departure. The whole hiſtory of comets and their effects warrants this concluſion. Seneca made this remark ſeventeen centuries ago. Theſe are his words.</p>
                        <p>"Ariſtoteles ait, cometas ſignificare tempeſtatem et ventorum intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantiam atque imbrium.—Non ſtatim cometes ortus ventos et pluvias minat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He then mentions that ſuch was the fact, with the comet predicted by Ariſtotle and Theophraſius, and which appeared in the conſulſhip of Paterculus and Vapiſcus. Nat. Queſt. lib. 7.</p>
                        <p>I would further obſerve that comets move in trajectories of an elip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical or parabolic form, the ſun being ſituated in one of the foci. The time when we obſerve them is when they paſs this part of the ellipſis. Now according to the univerſal law of planets, by which they deſcribe equal area<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Before their appearance, and after their departure, their movement is ſlower, than when within the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſyſtem, and they may be near the earth, many months before they enter the ſyſtem or become viſible. Hence their influence on the earth ſo long before and after their appearance.</p>
                        <p>It is further to be obſerved that many comets doubtleſs enter the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem and paſs round the ſun without ever being ſeen, and ſuch as come from regions of ſpace directly oppoſite to the earth, muſt be <hi>inviſible,</hi> unleſs we can ſee them in the ſplendor of the ſun's rays. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark is as old as Seneca and older. He relates an inſtance, in which Poſidonious diſcovered a comet, in the darkneſs of a ſolar eclipſe, which would not have been ſeen, had not the eclipſe happened. Lib. 7. ſect. 20.</p>
                        <p>Newton and Halley have made the ſame remark. Hence perhaps we may account for violent ſeaſons, like the ſevere winter of 1780, which happened without the appearance of any comet. This is mere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>

                     <pb n="88" facs="unknown:036687_0443_100A89C4E09A2D18"/>I cannot however admit, that the exploſions of ſubterranean fires, are the direct exciting cauſe of peſtilential diſeaſes. It is indeed aſcertained, beyond all queſtion, that periods of exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive peſtilence and mortality are remarkable for earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes. But the exploſions of fire do not ſo generally <hi>precede</hi> epidemic diſeaſes, as to authorize the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they <hi>produce</hi> thoſe diſeaſes. Earthquakes occur, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prevalence of peſtilential or other mortal epidemics, but in the midſt of the period, or ſometimes at the concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Hence I deduce an opinion, that peſtilence and earthquakes depend on one common cauſe; which excites into action the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fires. But I ſuppoſe the action or fermentation may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, for months and even years, the exploſion in earthquakes and volcanoes and by means of an inſenſible vapor, or heat or electrical diſcharges, the elements of water and air may be eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially affected, in ſuch a manner as to impair the principles of animal and vegetable life. Whether this is a juſt explication of the cauſe, may be a queſtion; but ſo many phenomena concur to authorize it, that I cannot withhold my aſſent to the general principle.</p>
                  <p>The ſame effect perhaps may be produced by the exceſſive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mere ſtimulus upon the animal ſyſtem, without the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a deleterious vapor into the air.</p>
                  <p>A remarkable evidence of the effects of fire or electricity on the earth and air, before its exploſion, is the extreme drouth which is often experienced over whole continents or the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:036687_0444_100AA404C9B56D88"/>
whole world, for ſix and even twelve months antecedent to a great eruption of volcanoes.</p>
                  <p>In confirmation of my principle, that the changes in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments producing epidemic diſeaſes, are effected by the all-perva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding action of electricity, the uſual appearance of meteors or celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial lights, in peſtilential periods, muſt be mentioned. For the truth of the fact, we have ample proofs in every age. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of meteors or other celeſtial appearances of fire, which are recorded of peſtilential periods, are ſo numerous, as to leave no room to queſtion the connection between the cauſe of peſtilence, and the fire that belongs to the ſyſtem. Sometimes theſe fiery ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances are ſtationary lights in the ſky, which the frightened im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations of men have formed into armies ready for combat, and conſidered as the preludes of bloody battles. Sometimes the heavens have been filled with thoſe ſmall meteors, called falling or ſhooting ſtars. At other times immenſe globes of fire have traverſed the celeſtial regions, and burſt with a tremendous report.</p>
                  <p>During a plague in Vienna in 1679, ſays Van Swieten, vol. 16. p. 19. from Sorbait, ſeveral bluiſh fiery balls were ſeen in the air, ſome of which fell and ſenſibly increaſed the heat.</p>
                  <p>In October 1709, when the plague was in Dantzick, a blue fiery globe came from the north weſt and ſhot over the town with amazing celerity, illuminating the town and falling at the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                  <p>During the extreme heat which introduced the peſtilence of the laſt ſummer, 1798, about the 9th of Auguſt, the ſmall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors or falling ſtars were incredibly numerous, for ſeveral nights. They almoſt all ſhot from the north-eaſt to the ſouth-weſt, and ſucceeded each other ſo rapidly as to keep the eye of a curious ſpectator almoſt conſtantly engaged.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck remarks that during the ſummers of 1635 and 6, at the time of the ſevere plague in Holland, there was a vaſt number of ardent ſtars, gliding through the celeſtial regions and

                     </gap>90 from the building of Rome.</p>
                  <p>A flame in the heavens is noted under the years, 733, 742 and 788, all which were peſtilential. This flame is not deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and whether it was of the ſpecies of Aurora Borealis, which extended over the celeſtial region, or of that ſpecies of light, or yellowiſh red colour, which diſtinguiſhes our modern <hi>dark days,</hi> cannot perhaps be determined. But a curious phenomenon of this kind happened in the ſevere winter of 1741, which was too remarkable to be paſſed over in ſilence; eſpecially as it may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly explain what Livy and many other hiſtorians have recorded, that at certain times, "it rained blood." The aſſertion is often found in hiſtorians of credit, and has by the moderns, been num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered among the extravagancies of popular credulity. But an appearance which would warrant ſuch an aſſertion occurred in this country, and is ſtill recollected by old people.</p>
                  <p>In the month of January 1741, in the midſt of one of the coldeſt winters of this century, there was a little relaxation of the rigorous cold, during which the heavens were overcaſt with clouds and a little rain fell. Late at night, during this falling weather, the heavens appeared all in a flame, ſo bright as to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the earth and render objects every where diſtinctly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Many people ſaw it and were alarmed, ſuppoſing the great day was at hand. The rain which fell during this light, had preciſely the appearance of drops of blood diſtilling from the clouds.</p>
                  <p>This relation is taken from my father, who was then nineteen years old, and recollects all the circumſtances more minutely than the events of the laſt year.</p>
                  <p>The well known dark day in May 1780, was diſtinguiſhed by a ſimilar light in the heavens; but not occurring in the night, it was leſs an object of wonder.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="unknown:036687_0446_100AA406503DFD50"/>I ſtrongly ſuſpect a ſimilar phenomenon will account for thoſe paſſages in many hiſtories, which ſpeak of raining blood, and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to do juſtice to the veracity of the writers.</p>
                  <p>Appearances of this kind have uſually occurred in periods of peſtilence, when the imaginations of men have been ſubject to alarm; and they have often happened during extraordinary ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The light of 1741, was during a moſt ſevere winter, and in the moſt ſickly period, that has occurred this century. See the London bills of mortality. In America, that winter was followed by peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The dark day of 1780, was on the opening of ſpring, after a moſt ſevere winter, and altho that year was not ſickly in general, yet in the year following, we had an epidemic catarrh, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſeries of epidemic diſeaſes of other kinds. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able too that on that very day began a violent eruption of mount Etna.</p>
                  <p>In 1716, in the month of October, happened a dark day; this was after a moſt ſevere winter in Europe. I have no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſeaſons in America, but the next winter was unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſevere, and ſnow fell in extraordinary quantities.</p>
                  <p>On the 9th of Auguſt 1732 happened another dark day. This was followed by earthquakes, a ſevere winter and univerſal catarrh.</p>
                  <p>The 19th of October 1762 was equally remarkable for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with the phenomenon of a red, or yellowiſh tinge in the heavens, which gave to the ſun, when it appeared, the color of blood. Some rain fell during the day, and the water was of a dirty ſulphurous ſmell. There had been two earthquakes, with epidemic catarrh, in America in 1761. In the ſame year with the darkneſs, 1762, the catarrh was epidemic in Europe; and the winter of that year was exceſſively ſevere in both hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheres. A comet appeared in 1762 and an eruption of Etna followed the ſevere winter, in 1763. There were earthquakes alſo in Aſia in 1762. Who can doubt that the vapor, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning ſuch darkneſs, is the effect of the agitation of the fire of the globe?</p>
                  <p>Similar inſtances of extraordinary darkneſs have occurred in
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:036687_0447_100A89C86F0D93F8"/>
every age. They are mentioned in the years before Chriſt 366 and 295—and of the Chriſtian era 252, 746, 775, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other periods. And the reader will obſerve, this darkneſs is cotemporary with peſtilence, in almoſt every inſtance. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the plague of 746, the darkneſs was of ſeveral days dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion —in 252 it was of three days, and in 775 of ſix days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. A ſimilar darkneſs accompanied the peſtilence in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, in the days of Pharaoh. Many other inſtances have been mentioned in the preceding hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>In America, it has been cuſtomary to aſcribe this unuſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to condenſed volumes of ſmoke, after the burning of immenſe tracts of woods in the weſtern parts of the country. But I cannot learn that any great fires have uſually preceded theſe dark days; and negative evidence, in ſo many inſtances, amounts to proof that no great foreſts have been burnt. Beſides, the ſame phenomenon has been often obſerved, in countries where there were no foreſts, as in Italy, Syria, Aſia Minor and Egypt, and eſpecially in England.</p>
                  <p>That the ſmoke of burning foreſts cannot be the cauſe may be rendered very certain by theſe conſiderations. Firſt, the cauſe is not equal to the effect. Had the woods from the 40th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of latitude in America to the 50th been all conſumed in a day, the ſmoke would not have been ſufficient to cloud the ſun over the territory covered by darkneſs on the 19th of May. Any perſon may judge of this who has ſeen large tracts of foreſt on fire. That thirty or forty miles of burning foreſt, ſhould cover five hundred miles with impenetrable darkneſs, is too ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to deſerve a ſerious refutation.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, the color of ſmoke, when elevated into high regions of the atmoſphere, is very different from that of the vapor which cauſes the darkneſs on all ſuch occaſions.</p>
                  <p>But what decides this queſtion is the lightning, thunder and rain, and eſpecially the meteors that accompany theſe clouds of vapor. As far as I can learn, ſome or all of theſe phenomena attend dark days. Thunder was heard on the morning of the 19th of May, in moſt places. Mem. Am. Acad. vol. 1. 238. Violent thunder ſqualls and a meteor followed the great darkneſs
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:036687_0448_100AA407D7C8A368"/>
in Canada in 1785. Theſe phenomena demonſtrate that the clouds, on ſuch occaſion, have a connection with electricity. This is further evidenced by the ſmell of ſulphur, in the water that falls, and the ſcum that is left on objects—ſmoke would not produce either; nor would the largeſt volume of ſmoke ever raiſed into the air, ſpread over an extenſive region, a denſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that ſhould become viſible and tangible on the earth. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this darkneſs or vapor ſometimes occurs in winter, when the earth is covered with ſnow.</p>
                  <p>When we connect with theſe facts, the circumſtance that theſe dark days always occur, during or near the time of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or the unuſual ſeaſons which accompany peſtilence and epidemic dieaſes of other kinds, we ſhall be at no loſs to charge them to the account of the central fires, or the diſcharges of electricity. This accumulation of vapor is not a more ſurpriſing phenomenon, than the ſudden change in the properties of the atmoſphere which produces univerſal catarrh.</p>
                  <p>Hodge, who wrote on the plague of London, and who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears not to have been rewarded with celebrity equal to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, ſuppoſes the cauſe of peſtilential diſeaſes to be a ſubtle aura, or vapor exhaled from the bowels of the earth, which has, by too much heat and humidity, loſt its wholeſome qualities. He ſays, in proof of his opinion, that a given quantity of earth, infuſed into water in ſpring, depoſits more ſalt than at another time of the year.</p>
                  <p>His idea ſeems to be not very different from that of Van Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, who ſuppoſes the cauſe of peſtilence to be a gas or air, which has <hi>putrified by continuance,</hi> as the tranſlation is; by which is meant, probably, a ſtagnation in the earth.</p>
                  <p>The doctrin of an inſenſible vapor, infuſed into the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere from the bowels of the earth, may perhaps be thought wholly conjectural. But there are ſome phenomena which can hardly be reſolved without reſorting to the action of the electrical fluid. The ſudden changes of weather cannot be accounted for, in all caſes, by changes in the winds. Indeed the moſt reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing philoſophical men acknowledge themſelves puzzled to aſſign reaſons, for many of the rapid tranſitions from heat to cold and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:036687_0449_100AA443728CFE88"/>
from cold to heat. It has been ſuggeſted, that the heat may aſcend and deſcend in the atmoſphere, by means of phyſical laws, to us unknown; but this ſuppoſition is not ſupported by any clear proofs, perhaps not by rational probabilities.</p>
                  <p>There are many reaſons which incline me to believe that the principle of fire, the moſt ſubtle, penetrating, active fluid in creation, and unqueſtionably the moſt powerful agent in all the movements of matter, paſſes more frequently and rapidly from the earth into the atmoſphere and vice verſa, than is commonly imagined. I ſuſpect that an intimate connection ſubſiſts in this reſpect, between the interior of the globe, and the atmoſphere which ſurrounds it.</p>
                  <p>To the rapid paſſing of heat from the earth to the air, and from the air to the earth, we may perhaps aſcribe many of the amazing changes which take place in the temperature of the air, in a few hours, and often without a change of wind. The increaſe and the moderation of cold are ſometimes very obvious, long before the change of winds to which we uſually aſcribe ſuch changes; and I ſuſpect that the changes of winds are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>effect,</hi> than the cauſe, of a change in the temperature.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome appearances, in the atmoſphere, previous to ſhocks of earthquake, which demonſtrate a cloſe connection between the atmoſphere and ſubterranean fire. A remarkable one in this country, and generally in others, is a univerſal ſeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and tranquillity in the atmoſphere. The ſky is cloudleſs, and all nature, if at night, is wrapped in profound ſilence. This phenomenon is too uniform a precurſor of earthquakes, to be deemed an accidental circumſtance. It muſt be an effect of ſome connection between the air above, and the cauſe of earthquakes.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable alſo that ſeamen ſometimes obſerve a ſwelling of the ocean, without wind, and before any ſhock of the earth; and this fact, Pliny mentions among the ſigns of an approaching earthquake.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Is not this ſwelling of the ocean, previous to an earthquake, anal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agous to the tides? May not both be aſcribed to the force of electricity; the ſwell of the water preceding earthquakes being irregular, as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on no regular viſible cauſe; and the tides being more regular, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the effect of the moon's influence on the electrical principle. This idea ſeems to derive ſome ſtrength from the known fact that earthquakes uſually happen in periods of the moon's revolution, when that orb ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts its greateſt influence on the earth. From numerous calculations, it appears that earthquakes uſually occur near the moon's perigee or apogee or the change or conjunction of ſun and moon; generally about three days before or after the conjunction—this, by the way, is the very time when epidemic diſeaſes uſually invade the patient, or come to fatal termination, according to the remarks of all modern phyſicians —a ſingular fact that may lead to important concluſions.</p>

                  <p>Theſe phenomena indicate a connection between the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere and the ſubterranean fire, which is altogether inviſible, and to men, imperceptible. We perceive nothing, before the ſhock but univerſal ſerenity and calm; but the delicate ſenſes of the fowls of heaven are affected; they fly about in a fright and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to want the uſual ſupport from the air. The waters of the ocean alſo ſwell, altho no concuſſion of the earth or water can be perceived. Do not theſe phenomena indicate, either a want of the uſual weight or elaſticity of the air? Or what defect is there in the maſs of air ſurrounding the earth, which is to be ſupplied by an exploſion of ſubterranean fire? That there is a connection or dependence of the fire above on that beneath the earth, and that this ſubtle fluid acts and reacts between the earth and the air, with a rapidity and a force beyond all calculation, is to me extremely probable. The appearances that precede earthquakes indicate, that the fire which is to produce the ſhock, is in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent action, for a conſiderable time, before the ſhock. For ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral days before the earthquake at Oxford, Sept. 17, 1683, ignes fatui, luminous appearances, were frequently ſeen.</p>

                  <p>The various ſounds or noiſes which precede and attend earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, are a ſtrong confirmation of theſe ideas. The uſual premonitory ſound is compared to the rattling of carriages on a pavement. Sometimes it is deſcribed, as the rumbling of diſtant thunder. But in truth the ſound is different at different diſtances, and reſembles no other ſound in nature. It is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſui generis. It is moſt analogous, when near, to the rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling ſound from a near exploſion of the electrical fluid; as thoſe can teſtify who have been near the place where lightning has fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon objects. It bears no reſemblance at all to any artificial ſounds, made by the exploſions of gun-powder, or other human contrivances. It is moſt unqueſtionably the effect of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical fluid, ruſhing from one part of our ſyſtem to another— probably from the earth to the atmoſphere, to reſtore the equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium, which has been, by ſome means, deſtroyed, or to anſwer other unknown purpoſes. This idea correſponds with the mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern theory of earthquakes, which aſcribes them to the electrical fluid. See the Encyclopedia, art. earthquake. Let it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that at ſea, no ſound precedes an earthquake; water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good conductor of electricity.</p>
                  <p>Eruptions of volcanoes have alſo been preceded many weeks by a viſible fog or vapor, ſuſpended over the mountain, as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened before the great diſcharges of Heckla in 1783. To what cauſe ſhall we aſcribe this, but to the action of fire which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes the exploſion? And if a viſible vapor may be extricated by this action, for <hi>months</hi> before the exploſion, of which we have <hi>certain</hi> evidence, why may we not ſuppoſe, a ſmaller action or force to expel an inviſible vapor, in any place and at any time?</p>
                  <p>Other facts authorize this conjecture. On the 12th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember 1784, the water of the Loch Tay in Scotland, ſuddenly receded 300 feet and left the channel dry; then returned; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing this vibration for every ſeven minutes for two hours, and at the ſame hour in the day, for a week, with leſs violence.

                  <bibl>Sinclair, vol. 6. 623.</bibl>
                  <p>If we admit then the action of electricity to be the cauſe of earthquakes, we ſhall have reached the general proximate cauſe of thoſe epidemic diſeaſes which ſpeedily ſucceed concuſſions of the earth. The cauſe muſt be the action of fire, the moſt ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic principle in nature. The manner in which this effect is produced, whether by forcing an unwholeſome vapor from the interior of the earth, and vitiating the atmoſphere; or whether by ſimply changing, on mechanical principles, the proportion of oxygen contained in atmoſpheric air, or by mere ſtimulus or other unknown means, is a queſtion of a curious nature, and worthy of philoſophic inveſtigation.</p>
                  <p>One thing is very evident, that what I denominate a <hi>peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial principle,</hi> does, at certain times, pervade not only the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of air, but the water alſo. The proofs of this are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly numerous and convincing. In all the great plagues which have afflicted the human race, other animals, as horſes, cattle, ſheep, ſometimes cats, dogs and fowls, together with the fiſh in rivers and the ocean, and even vegetables, have borne their ſhare in the calamity. The peſtilential principle has extended to every ſpecies of life. The beaſts of the field periſh with deadly epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics; the fiſh die on the bottom of rivers and the ſea, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lean and ſickly; while corn is blaſted on the moſt fertile plains, and the fruits in gardens and orchards, wither or fail to arrive at their uſual ſtate of perfection.</p>
                  <p>In the deſtructive plague which deſolated Italy in the time of Romulus, Plutarch and Zonaras mention a general ſterility of the earth; the very trees were affected, and all nature appeared to be defective in its powers of production.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the peſtilential period, in the reign of Juſtinian, Baronius ſtates that corn was deficient in quantity, and defective in its nouriſhing qualities.</p>
                  <p>About the year 1600, crops failed in all parts of Europe; as they did in both hemiſpheres, about the cloſe of the laſt centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:036687_0454_100A89DF003C0730"/>
Such was the caſe in 1740, in ſome parts of Europe; and in 1766. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of grain in India in 1770, and in 1783 and 1789, are ſtill remembered; and in ſome of theſe inſtances, the crops failed, at the ſame time, in China, India, Europe and America.</p>
                  <p>When exceſſive rains or dry ſeaſons precede this failure of crops, men are at no loſs to aſſign the cauſe; altho, in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they may ſometimes miſtake the true cauſe. But it often happens that grain fails of its uſual perfection, in ſeaſons appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently the moſt temperate and favorable. Obſerving farmers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that, in certain years, when blaſt or mildew is expected from intemperate weather, grain proves to be good; at other times, the grain will ſhrink very much, under a ſeries of weather apparently the moſt propitious. This has been obſerved in Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field county, in Connecticut, where the excellent lands formerly produced great crops of wheat, with as much certainty as any other grain; but within a few years paſt, wheat has failed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent cauſe. In ſome caſes, the farmer ſcarcely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives his ſeed, altho the ſeaſons are favorable and no inſect ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears.<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſame was the caſe in all the eaſtern ſtates for three or four years; but in this ſummer, 1799, the wheat has every where a full grain.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The failure of certain ſpecies of fruit-trees and ſhrubs is a fact equally remarkable.</p>
                  <p>Some kinds of apple, for a few years paſt, have been ſmall, knotty and ſprinkled over with ſpecks.</p>
                  <p>The plum-tree has become full of warts, or bulbous excreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences, which kill the tree, and in ſome parts of our country, bid fair to extinguiſh the ſpecies. Theſe have been ſuſpected to proceed from a fly or ſmall worm; but on examination by a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope, I find reaſon to queſtion this fact. Some of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcences contain a ſmall white worm, about a line in length; but they perforate the wood after the excreſcence is formed, as appears by their path; and ſome of theſe warts contain no inſect whatever. The inſect therefore finds a nidus in the excreſcence, but is rather an effect, than a cauſe. The burſting of the bark is a diſeaſe, which ſeems to have begun or been very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, during the preſent peſtilential period.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="unknown:036687_0455_100A89E1C5683378"/>The peach-tree has, within a few years, been particularly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to be deſtroyed by a worm, which attacks it juſt below the ſurface of the earth, and ſeparates the bark from the wood. If this is a common evil, ſtill the vaſt increaſe of it, at particular periods, is among the phenomena of peſtilence. The locuſt is periſhing by a ſimilar malady.</p>
                  <p>Cotemporary with theſe diſeaſes of the plum and the peach, has been a diſtemper of the pear, uſually called the pound pear, one of the moſt delicious of the ſpecies. For eight or ten years paſt, that fruit has been, univerſally in the part of the country to which my obſervations have extended, ſubject to a blaſt, from a ſpecies of ruſt which covers a large portion of its ſurface. In my own garden, not one in five is fit to eat; but I have ſeen one gentleman in a neighboring town, who thinks the pear is begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to recover.</p>
                  <p>The univerſal death of the prim is a phenomenon ſtill more extraordinary, and a moſt ſevere calamity. The town of Eaſt-Hampton on Long-Iſland, loſt, in two or three years, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles of hedge—a greater loſs, ſays Mr. L. Hommidieu, in a paper publiſhed among the tranſactions of the New-York Agricultural Society, than if every houſe in the town had been burnt to the ground; as no proper ſubſtitute for fences has yet been diſcovered. The Engliſh black thorn has been tried, but has failed, owing to a fly that perforates the bark.</p>
                  <bibl>See part 2. 103.</bibl>
                  <p>The cauſe of the death of the prim is not known, nor the preciſe time when it began. But in Connecticut the failure was obſerved about twenty-five years ago; between the years 1770 and 1777, during the prevalence of the terrible angina and dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entery among men. It contiuned gradually to extend for ſome years, and the prim has at laſt totally diſappeared.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable that theſe diſeaſes among corn, fruit-trees and ſhrubs have generally, if not always, appeared firſt on the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ſhore, and gradually extended themſelves into the interior country. This is an obſervation made by many men in different parts of Connecticut. May we not from this circumſtance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an argument, that the <hi>infection is imported!!!</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="101" facs="unknown:036687_0456_100A8A8564621E10"/>But theſe phenomena are not <hi>new</hi> in the world; they are new only to people who do not read.

He takes notice alſo of another fact, which is, the unuſual diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to putrefaction in all kinds of fiſh, fleſh and vegetables, during peſtilence. This putrefaction, is, by the moderns, conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a fruitful ſource of diſeaſes. In ſome caſes it may be ſo; but it is always an <hi>effect</hi> of the ſame cauſe which produces epidemics.</p>
                  <p>Another remarkable fact to prove the univerſality of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential principle, is the ſickneſs and death of fiſh in rivers and the ſea. Several examples are recorded in ancient hiſtory. See the years 590, 994, 1240 and others. The number however of ſuch facts is not great, in the old books; and whenever this phenomenon occurred, it was aſcribed to froſt, to a battle among the fiſh, or other improbable cauſe.</p>
                  <p>In modern times we have many examples recorded, but prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably many others have eſcaped obſervation; or been conſidered as things of no moment to mankind; for within a century paſt, the opinion that the plague is propagated, in northern climates, by contagion only, ſeems to have ſuſpended all rational enquiries into the cauſe of the diſorder.</p>
                  <p>That the fiſh on the Britiſh coaſt or in the rivers, periſhed, during the laſt great plague in 1665, I find no where related, in a manner to render the fact certain; but I find Hodge has men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a fact of that ſort as a proof that peſtilence is occaſioned by an unwholeſome vapor from the earth.</p>
                  <p>The death of the haddock on the coaſt of Norway in 1789, has been already mentioned, but as there were many ſhocks of earthquake in Scotland, about that period, it is not impoſſible that the haddock might have been ſuddenly killed by ſome concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:036687_0457_100A8A87B47F1E10"/>
of the water. A ſimilar event took place on the American coaſt, in the great earthquake of November 1755, when ſome whales and multitudes of cod were killed, and ſeen afterwards floating on the water. I throw all ſuch caſes out of the queſtion, and confine myſelf to the ſickneſs and death of fiſh, when there has been no concuſſion of the waters, to occaſion a violent death.</p>
                  <p>The diſappearance of the blue-fiſh from Nantucket, in 1764, juſt after the great mortality among the Indians, is a remarkable fact. Not leſs ſingular was the ſickneſs and extinction of the Wellfleet oyſters in 1775, the year of a fatal dyſentery in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica. Still more remarkable was the ſickneſs or ill-ſtate of the cod-fiſh taken on the banks of Newfoundland in the year 1788. They were thin, unfit for uſe and when preſerved, turned to a blue or dark color.</p>
                  <p>Ariſtotle remarked that no one peſtilential diſeaſe appears to affect all kinds of fiſh; but that theſe animals are ſubject to ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is known by their being thin, and not changing their colors.</p>
                  <bibl>De Hiſt. Animal. lib. 8. ca. 20.</bibl>
                  <p>But to come ſtill nearer to the preſent time. In the years 1793 and 4, the oyſters on the coaſt of Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland, were all ſickly, watery, and taſteleſs; wholly unfit for food, and in ſome inſtances, brought on nauſea or ſickneſs in thoſe who ate of them. This was the very time when the ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latina was ſpreading over the country, with malignant dyſentery and typhus.</p>
                  <p>The ſhad which came to the New-York market in the ſpring of 1796, which was the period of peſtilence in New-York, were leaner than uſual, and periſhed, in defiance of the powers of ſalt.</p>
                  <p>In 1797, multitudes of ſmall dead fiſh floated down James river in Virginia. It is remarkable that in the ſummer following, all the country from Norfolk to Philadelphia, the very latitudes through which that river paſſes, was very ſickly; Norfolk, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore and Philadelphia were all afflicted with the bilious plague.</p>
                  <p>I have been informed, that many dead ſhad were ſeen to float down the Suſquehanna, in June 1798; but of the fact, I have not ſatisfactory evidence.</p>
                  <p>The reader cannot fail to remark here, the correſpondence in

place between the epidemic diſeaſes in the water and the air; the fiſh and the human race, in <hi>contiguous</hi> regions, being diſeaſed about the <hi>ſame time</hi>—a fact too remarkable to be permitted to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape particular obſervation.</p>
                  <p>The mortal peſtilence among cats, in Europe and America, in 1797, is a fact too well known to be repeated. The ſickly ſtate of the water in the wells of New-Haven, during the peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential period of 1795; was evidenced by the number of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malculae it contained.</p>

It is probable that Sorbait has miſtaken the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this ſtench; it is probable the great mortality in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity and the impurity of the water proceeded both from one ſource, an uncommon effuſion of ſubterranean vapor in that particular quarter, or other unknown cauſe.</p>
                  <p>All theſe phenomena denote a peſtilential cauſe in water as well as air. Whether that cauſe is a poſitive ſubſtance infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the elements from ſubterranean regions, increaſing the due proportion of oxygen; whether it is a negative ſtate of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, occaſioned by the abſtraction of oxygen; or whether it is occaſioned ſimply by a chemical alteration in the elements, by the mechanical operation of the electric fluid, which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce new properties in air and water, by means of new combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their parts, are queſtions not eaſily ſolved. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attempting to penetrate into the myſteries of nature, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold primary cauſes, we may be certain of their effects, and from this branch of knowledge, may deduce uſeful concluſions.</p>
                  <p>We know, for we ſee, the effects of ſome mortal principle, which, at particular periods, deſtroys or impairs the uſual powers of life, through the animal and vegetable kingdoms. We ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conclude that this cauſe muſt be general, affecting the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life, over whole regions of the earth, and beneath the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:036687_0459_100AA4458705E9A0"/>
waters of the ocean. Of ſo much we are certain. As to the primary or remote cauſes, we ſhall probably remain in the dark— and as to the proximate cauſes, we can only indulge a rational ſpirit of philoſophical enquiry, that may lead to probabilities.</p>
                  <p>Sydenham is among the moſt reſpectable authorities for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of a change in the properties of air from a ſubterraneous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por. His words are, vol. 1. p. 8. Wallis's Edit. "There are various general conſtitutions of years, that owe their origin neither to heat, cold, dryneſs nor moiſture; but depend rather on a certain ſecret and inexplicable alteration in the bowels of the earth, whence the air becomes impregnated with ſuch kinds of effluvia, as ſubject the human body to particular diſtempers, ſo long as that kind of conſtitution prevails, which after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain courſe of years, declines and gives way to another."</p>
                  <p>The reader will recollect that when the plague firſt broke out in Athens, the people alledged that their enemies had poiſoned the wells. In the mortal plague of 1349, the Germans ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Jews had poiſoned the wells, and vented their rage upon the harmleſs Iſraelites. Theſe ſuſpicions doubtleſs aroſe from the bad quality of the waters, ſimilar to what was obſerved in New-Haven in 1795: And the ſuſpicion of poiſon was full as well founded, as the modern doctrin of importation, in moſt caſes of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>The death of fiſh in rivers and the ocean, is one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt arguments to prove the cauſe of peſtilence to be a ſubtle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, expelled or exhaled from ſubterranean regions. That fiſh do in fact die of epidemic diſeaſes, is a fact as well authentica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and as certain, as that epidemic diſeaſes affect the human race —and it is equally certain that ſuch mortality among the fiſh, is uſually cotemporary with peſtilence among men, on the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſhores. From theſe facts, we are powerfully inclined to believe, the general cauſe which affects the one ſpecies of animals, to be the ſame which affects the other ſpecies. This concluſion is eaſy, natural and irreſiſtible.</p>
                  <p>What then can be the principle which penetrates the waters, and reaches the animal functions of fiſh and oyſters on the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the ſea? Can it be a vitiated ſtate of the ſuperincumbent
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:036687_0460_100AA448E177EEA0"/>
atmoſphere? Can a deleterious principle, belonging to the air, find its way through a maſs of water, and deſtroy life, as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as in its natural fluid, on the ſurface of the earth? Theſe are queſtions, I pretend not to ſolve. But cannot help thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>king that the only efficient cauſe, within our narrow comprehenſion, capable of extending the principle of deſtruction through the different elements, is the all-pervading energy of fire or electricity. The modus operandi is among the impenetrable arcana of the phyſical world.</p>
                  <p>It may not be uſeleſs to introduce here an obſervation made by elderly people in America, that in ſickly years, the aurora bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>realis does not appear. It is certain that during the preſent peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential period, ſince 1790, that phenomenon has never been obſerved, at leaſt not in any diſtinguiſhed degree of brightneſs.</p>
                  <p>But the hiſtory of the aurora borealis does not warrant the juſtneſs of this obſervation, as a general fact. The years 1564 and 5, which were diſtinguiſhed by northern lights, were ſickly in Europe, and in many parts raged the plague. The ſame lights were very ſplendid in November 1575, a year when the plague was ſpreading over Europe with unuſual violence and mortality. The ſame were repeatedly obſerved in 1580, the year of a moſt ſevere univerſal catarrh, when the plague raged in Paris, and when Cairo loſt 500,000 people by the ſame diſeaſe. Theſe lights were again viſible in 1621, and deſcribed by Gaſſendus in France, who it is ſaid gave them the name of <hi>aurora borealis.</hi> That year was noted for a moſt fatal epidemic ſmall-pox and the Hungarian fever in Europe; and the plague which raged among the Indians in America in 1618, had not ceaſed in 1621.</p>
                  <p>From this time to the year 1707, we have no account of the appearance of theſe lights. In that year, they appeared, but not of a remarkable brightneſs. If theſe lights appeared in this long interval, from 1621 to 1707, it is ſtrange that aſtronomers ſhould have left us no account of them. Certain it is, that the great Halley never ſaw this phenomenon till the year 1716, when he was 60 years old, and he began to deſpair of ever beholding it. During this long ſuſpenſion of the aurora borealis, epidemic peſtilential diſeaſes occurred very often in both hemiſpheres.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:036687_0461_100AA44B288CA168"/>In the ſame interval, theſe lights were never ſeen in America; and our anceſtors, when they firſt beheld them, at the beginning of this century, ſuppoſed them a new phenomenon in creation; the memory of them having been loſt.</p>
                  <p>In 1719, in November, appeared theſe lights; which was at the commencement of a ſickly period of great ſeverity and extent —the plague was then raging in the Levant. A ſplendid phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon of the ſame kind was obſerved in Feb. 1720, the moſt unhealthy year of that period. The ſame in the three following years, and in 1725, 1726, 1728, 1730, repeatedly in 1733, a ſickly year, repeatedly in 1735 and 36, very ſickly years, when the mortal ſore throat prevailed—alſo in 1737.</p>
                  <p>From theſe facts, we conclude that the cauſe of peſtilential diſeaſes, has no connection with theſe viſible phenomena of the electrical fluid, as they are obſerved indifferently in healthy or ſickly years. It is evident however that the lumen boreale, is, in a certain degree, periodical.</p>
                  <p>Let us attend now to the effects of a peſtilential ſtate of air and water, in the production of inſects and ſmall animals. This is one of the moſt remarkable ſymptoms of a ſickly ſtate of the elements, and it is the more neceſſary to inſiſt on this phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, becauſe it is viſible to every eye, and carries with it, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring peſtilence, a demonſtration of the doctrines for which I contend.</p>
                  <p>In the threſhold of the hiſtory of plagues, we meet with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of myriads of noxious inſects, accompanying theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities.

Theſe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals ſeem to have their origin in the deſarts of Arabia, border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Egypt and Syria; but they have often overſpread all Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtine, Judea and Italy—ſometimes they have penetrated into
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:036687_0462_100AA4502D6CB920"/>
Germany, Poland and Ruſſia. It is unneceſſary here to enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the inſtances related in the foregoing hiſtory, of the rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of theſe animals; the reader has obſerved that inſtances of their appearance have often occurred in different periods, and that they are always the harbingers or the companions of the plague.</p>
                  <p>This fact leaves no room to queſtion, that the ſame ſtate of air in the oriental regions, which will generate epidemic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, will often produce thoſe animals in unuſual numbers. They do not indeed always attend the plague; the particular ſeaſon moſt favorable to their generation is an exceſſively dry one; but it is obvious, that they rarely appear in deſolating ſwarms, except in periods when the neighboring countries are afflicted with mortal epidemics.</p>
                  <p>It is true that, in two or three inſtances, hiſtory informs us, dreadful plagues have originated from the putrefaction of theſe animals—the inſtance of the peſtilence on the African coaſt, about 126 years before the Chriſtian era, is memorable. But while this fact is not diſputed, we muſt obſerve that the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod was diſtinguiſhed for peſtilence in other countries, where no ſuch local or particular cauſe exiſted. Great ſwarms of locuſts therefore in the eaſtern countries, <hi>may</hi> be the cauſe of peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſeaſes, but always by accident; whereas they are certainly the forerunners or companions of that calamity.</p>

                  <p>The year 1633, which produced a peſtilential fever among the ſettlers at Plymouth in America, was remarkable for ſwarms of large flies, which filled the woods with their humming ſounds.</p>
                  <p>In the month of Auguſt, during a dreadful drouth at Bengal in 1770, which cut ſhort the rice-crops and produced a terrible famin, and ſubſequent epidemic fever, the air was filled with a
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:036687_0464_100AA451B3FAF220"/>
cloud of inſects, of the ſize of a horſe-ſtinger, with a long red body and large head; they continued to obſcure the ſun for ſome days, during which all toads, frogs and inſects on the earth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, but this cloud in the air did not deſcend to the earth. The next year, a million of people periſhed with epidemic diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The preſent peſtilential period in America was introduced by ſuch multitudes of canker-worms and palmer-worms, as were never before known. Muſquetoes have been the harbingers and attendants on the diſeaſes in New-York and Philadelphia in 1793, 1795 and 1798. In this latter year, the whole country has been overſpread with graſs-hoppers, which very much injured the meadows, paſtures and gardens.</p>
                  <p>On theſe facts I will juſt remark, that they ſerve to confirm the hiſtorical truth of the ſcriptures. The whole ſeries of facts, relative to the great plagues that have afflicted mankind, is a tiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of proofs, that the hiſtory of the ten plagues of Egypt was written on the ſpot, and is a faithful record of facts. If the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations of nature are uniform, the ſcriptures cannot be a ſpuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous production. They deſcribe Egypt and Syria, as to every thing reſpecting climate and productions, preciſely as they are at this day; and this fact is alone ſufficient to eſtabliſh their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity, againſt all the infidels on earth.</p>
                  <p>It may be impoſſible to define preciſely thoſe qualities of air and water which favor the production of unuſual multitudes of any particular ſort of inſects. It has been cuſtomary for writers to aſcribe them to <hi>putrefaction</hi> in the air; an indefinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible term. It is true that muſquetoes and ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects are generated in hot, moiſt, ſtagnant air, and in marſhy places, when the putrefaction of vegetable and animal ſubſtances, is uncommonly rapid. But they are produced in pure water, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, without any apparent mixture of vegetable matter, beyond what is common to all water.</p>
                  <p>Flies, on the contrary, are moſt numerous in a hot and dry ſeaſon. Moiſture is hoſtile to their exiſtence; and in the year 1795, when the rainy ſeaſon commenced about the 20th of July, preceding the fever in New-York, the flies almoſt wholly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and were ſucceeded by muſquetoes. Putrid ſubſtances
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:036687_0465_100AA45462569E70"/>
are the food of flies, but the ſeaſons moſt favorable to putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do not always produce flies in the greateſt numbers.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, it is not poſſible to account for the myriads of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects which appear in particular years, on any known principles of the animal economy, or any viſible properties of air and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If unuſual numbers of a particular inſect appear periodical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in caſe of the canker-worms, tho I have not ſatisfactory evidence of the regularity of <hi>their</hi> appearance, in uniform peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, we ſhould naturally conclude ſuch animals to paſs through other forms of exiſtence, and to re-appear in a particular noxious form, at the end of definite intervals of time. But were this the fact, it would ſtill remain a problem of a moſt embarraſſing difficulty, to diſcover the reaſon of their appearance in unhealthy periods only. For ſuch is the fact, with moſt of the inſects, and their tranſmigration, if admitted, will not in the leaſt help us to account for their exiſtence, in thoſe times only when the ſtate of the air is unfriendly to human life.</p>
                  <p>But in truth, as to moſt of the noxious inſects which mark pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of epidemic diſeaſes, we know them not to change their forms of exiſtence, nor are the times of their appearance, peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical. On the other hand, we obſerve they appear in ſickly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods; and in unuſual numbers, at no other time. We conclude therefore that a ſtate of the elements, unfriendly to the health of man, is favorable to the generation of noxious inſects, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attempting to explain the particular properties of the elements, which poſſeſs that prolific power.<note n="*" place="bottom">May it not be the effect of excitement, owing to unuſual electrical ſtimulus?</note> All I contend for, by theſe facts, is, that the peſtilential principle, whatever may be its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or properties is a <hi>general</hi> principle, affecting all the elements of life, and that to this general cauſe are we to aſcribe the delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſeaſes which, at times, ſpread over extenſive regions of the earth. Under this juſt and philoſophical view of the ſubject, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſinks to a very trifling conſideration, among the cauſes of epidemic diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>The order in which inſects and diſeaſes appear, is not uniform; but it uſually happens that the inſects are the firſt in order of time. This was the fact in 1770, when the flies clouded the heavens in
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:036687_0466_100AA455ECAF3968"/>
Bengal, and the worms darkened the earth in America. Such was the fact in 1791 when canker-worms in June gave to our orchards the aſpect of winter. But the whole progreſs of epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics is more or leſs marked by noxious and troubleſome inſects.</p>
                  <p>In 1798 and 1799, the meadows in ſome parts of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut have been almoſt covered with ſmall toads, of the ſize of a cheſnut, and as deſcribed by Fernelius, "coloris cineritii," of the color of aſhes. Theſe animals, in ſuch numbers, are unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al —they are not of the color of the common toad, and never grow to the ſame ſize. They come ſuddenly and in a few weeks diſappear! Who knows their origin or their end? Fernelius numbered them, more than two centuries ago, among the preſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of peſtilence, and we are witneſſes to the truth of his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>If we attend to the ſtate of a peſtilential air, in reſpect to its effects on inanimate objects, we are furniſhed with further proofs, that epidemic diſeaſes are the production, not of fomites from the ſick, but of a general deleterious principle.</p>
                  <p>A remarkable inſtance of the corrupt or defective ſtate of air, happened in the mortal plague of the year 252. See the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it under that year. It covered objects with what the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian calls "ros tabidus," a putrid corrupt dew or mould. A ſtate of air ſo extremely imperfect muſt have been utterly inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport healthy life, in the animal ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>The air of New-York in 1795 produced aſtoniſhing effects in the generation of mould, and the rapidity in the proceſs of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, in fleſh and vegetables, was almoſt incredible.</p>
                  <p>The fatal angina maligna among cattle in 1682 was attended with a blue miſt or dew on the herbage of paſtures. See the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it under that year.</p>
                  <p>It is not an unfrequent thing that a viſible and offenſive miſt or fog ariſes in places, during the rage of peſtilential diſeaſes. Such a miſt aroſe and ſpread over Dantzick, in Auguſt 1709, during the plague. This fog was ſo thick as to darken the air, for ſome time, and had a very offenſive ſmell.</p>

                  <p>Schreibner, cited by Van Swieten, Vol. 16. mentions that a ſmall cloud often hangs over the infected place. It is ſuggeſted

by that able author, that the contagion, collected into ſuch a cloud, may be diſperſed by winds, and afterwards collect at a different place. It is however more probable, that ſuch collections of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure vapor, are produced where they exiſt; and that, if once diſperſed, the particles are not afterwards collected. The phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon however is no inconſiderable evidence, that a peſtilential ſtate of the atmoſphere, is cauſed or increaſed by vapors exhaled from the bowels of the earth.</p>
                  <p>In the mortal peſtilence at Rome A. U. C. 576, Livy men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a bow extended over the temple of Saturn, three mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuns, and in the evening following, many tranſient meteors.</p>

                  <p>A ſimilar fog or vapor during eaſterly winds, appeared in New-York, in September 1798, in the moſt fatal period of the plague. Perſons who felt and ſaw it, deſcribe it as moſt diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the ſenſes; and its effects were very remarkable. The pavements of the ſtreets and other objects were covered with a coat of dew or mould, not however exactly reſembling either of thoſe ſubſtances; not unlike perhaps the "ros tabidus," or "ros ſanci ſimilis," of the year 252. Its effects were equally wonderful on the leaves of trees, which were covered with ſpots, which appeared as if corroded by an acid. And I have ſeen a cotton garment, which had been waſhed, and hung out on the night of the fog, which was alſo covered with ſpots of a dark, grey color, and which could not be taken out by any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of waſhing. During this period alſo, iron railings and pump-handles were ſuddenly covered over with ſcales of ruſt, or a ferruginous color. Theſe phenomena correſpond with the effects of the peſtilential air at Oczakow in 1739, in which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical inſtruments became livid or black, as did the ſilver hilt of a ſword.</p>
                  <p>Theſe recent facts which have come under my own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have enabled me to give due credit to hiſtorians, who men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſpots in garments, appearing ſuddenly, during the plague. The writers who mention this phenomenon were moſtly monks or other eccleſiaſtics, whoſe relations are highly tinged with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; and as their imaginations have uſually wrought up theſe appearances into the figure of a croſs, or other chimerical

form, and aſcribed to them ſome miraculous qualities, I had paſſed over the paſſages with very ſlight conſideration.</p>
                  <p>I have however tranſcribed or rather abridged one of theſe accounts, under the head of plagues in the reign of Juſtinian. It is from Warnefred, who relates that in the peſtilence at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria, the Genoeſe territory, there appeared ſuddenly "quaedam ſignacula," certain ſigns or ſpots, on doors of houſes, garments and utenſils which could not be waſhed out, but grew brighter by waſhing. See the account in the foregoing hiſtory, under the deſcription of the plagues between 542 and 600. I recollect reading ſeveral other accounts of ſimilar phenomena, which, for the reaſons juſt aſſigned, I neglected to tranſcribe when the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were before me, which I now regret.</p>
                  <p>The celebrated Boyle mentions ſimilar phenomena during peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence, and particularly an inſtance in Naples in the year 1660, which happened after an eruption of Veſuvius, and which he aſcribes to a vapor. The vapor, he remarks, made impreſſions of curious figures on garments; and he cites Thuanus and Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, as authorities for his opinion. See vol. 5. p. 60.</p>
                  <p>In the dreadful plague of 746, ſimilar figures appeared on the garments of people, which the writer calls cruciculae, little croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ſeemed as if drawn in oil. Theſe marks excited no ſmall terror, wherever they appeared.</p>
                  <bibl>Paulus Diaconus, Aug. Hiſtory, p. 1012.</bibl>
                  <p>Similar figures were impreſſed on the bodies of the men who were employed by Julian to rebuild Jeruſalem in 362 or 3, and who were driven from their work by earthquakes and eruptions of fire. From theſe facts we may be led to aſcribe the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch ſpots to ſome electrical proceſs, or combination with an acid.</p>
                  <p>Theſe phenomena indicate a peculiar ſtate of the air, which is not common even during peſtilence. It is a ſtate which marks the higheſt degree of derangement in its ordinary healthful qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, and ſuch, as bleſſed be God, does not often occur.</p>
                  <p>Another ſtrong proof of the doctrin here maintained of a peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential principle in the elements, is the well known fact, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the plague, fowls abandon the atmoſphere of the infected places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="unknown:036687_0469_100AA45D65209BB0"/>Livy mentions that in the terrible plague in Rome, anno urbis conditae 571, not a vulture was to be ſeen for two years.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Gottwald remarks that in the Dantzick plague of 1709, ſparrows, daws, ſtorks and ſwallows deſerted the place for four months. Dr. Schelwig has recorded a ſimilar fact; and Sorbait affirms that birds deſerted Vienna during the plague. Thoſe kept in cages died.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck has informed us that in the Holland plague of 1635 and 6 birds were unuſually rare. He remarks that birds more readily perceive the poiſonous ſtate of the air, and change their reſidence to places more ſalubrious, even abandoning their neſts and their young. The ſame fact has been obſerved by many med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical and hiſtorical writers.</p>
                  <p>The ancient phyſician and compiler of medical ſcience, Aetius, mentions, among the ſigns of approaching peſtilence, the death of birds and quadrupeds. If, ſays he, the circumambient air is the cauſe of the diſeaſe, it will firſt ſhow its effects in deſtroying birds; if vitious exhalations from the earth, are the cauſe, quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupeds will be firſt affected.</p>
                  <p>The fact goes to demonſtrate that the peſtilential principle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the aerial fluid and is offenſive to the delicate organs of fowls. It may be further mentioned, that the deleterious principle is often fatal to ſmall birds in cages, before it is perceived by the human race. It is a curious and well authenticated fact, that in the prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of a plague, in cities, ſmall birds ſicken and die; and not long after, the people in the ſame houſe, are ſeized with the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Diemerbroeck was frequently an eye-witneſs to the fact, and he obſerved, that wherever the ſmall birds died in cages, the plague never failed, ſometime after and often in two or three days, to attack the inhabitants of the dwelling. This is another proof amounting to demonſtration, that the peſtilential principle is a quality of the atmoſphere, and that it is <hi>progreſſive in its malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> having little or no dependence on the powers of contagion.</p>
                  <bibl>See Diem. de peſte, p. 11.</bibl>
                  <p>After all, the cauſe of violent and deſtructive epidemic diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes may remain a ſecret. We ſee the cauſes of the ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the ſeaſons, in marſhes, ſtagnant waters, confined air, and the like; but it often happens that peſtilence commits moſt
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:036687_0470_100AA460977E1190"/>
cruel ravages, in ſeaſons apparently the moſt temperate, and in places evidently the moſt ſalubrious.</p>
                  <p>The plague in 542, and in ſubſequent periods of the fifty years plague of Evagrius, aſcended to the tops of the hills and mountains. The terrible plague of 252, in the reign of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus and Voluſian, invaded every village and almoſt every houſe. The deadly plague of 1348 penetrated likewiſe to the moſt healthy ſpots on the globe and even to the regions of Greenland, ſweeping away the human race, with undiſtinguiſhing ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>Hildanus informs us that in the plague of Lauſanne, in 1613, the huts of the peaſants on the hills and mountains were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the malady, tho detached and having no intercourſe with the infected. The ſame fact is recorded of the plague in 1720, which extended to the villages and mountains of Provence.</p>
                  <p>In the Traitè de la peſte, p. 29, it is aſſerted that in the melancholy plague at Lyons in 1628, the filthieſt houſes, the crouded places, narrow ſtreets and confined apartments, were places of the moſt ſafety; while the moſt airy ſituations, as hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on hills, were moſt expoſed to the ravages of the diſorder. No place was exempt—the change of air was uſeleſs or perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; in ſome caſes, thoſe who enjoyed health in the impure air of the city, on removing into the country, were attacked with the malady. Malouin declares that the moſt populous and dirty places in Lyons and Marſeilles were leaſt affected with the plague.</p>
                  <p>Theſe facts are very ſingular; yet it is not difficult to account for them, on the principle of a ſuperabundance of oxygen, ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulus, or principle of life in the atmoſphere. If, as is ſuppoſed, a uſual cauſe of peſtilential diſorders, is a too great quantity of oxygen in the air, producing firſt the ſtenic or inflammatory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis, and of courſe indirect debility, then thoſe places muſt be moſt healthy, in ſuch a general ſtate of the air, where there is the ſmalleſt proportion of oxygen. This remark however is a mere conjecture; and the facts related of the plague in Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſtand as an exception to a very general rule, that the moſt filthy, unventilated places ſuffer moſt ſeverely by all kinds of peſtilential maladies.<note n="*" place="bottom">In Lyons, tanners and curriers eſcaped the plague, as did thoſe who cleanſed ſewers and privies. The ſame has generally been the caſe with the ſextons, and others employed in burying the dead.

                     <pb n="116" facs="unknown:036687_0471_100AA462E618DA78"/>It is alſo true in general, that the poor, who inhabit narrow ſtreets and alleys, amidſt filthy ſubſtances, ſuffer more by malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant complaints than the rich, who live in wider ſtreets, and more airy, cleanly houſes. To this however hiſtory preſents us ſome exceptions; caſes hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> occurred in which the rich have been the principal ſufferers, as in 1361.</p>
                  <p>While it may be difficult to aſſign preciſe reaſons for ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in the operation of the principle of deſtruction, the facts prove that this principle conſiſts in ſome hidden qualities of the elements, and does not ariſe from any of the ordinary viſible cauſes of diſeaſe. Riverius is explicit on this point. He avers that peſtilential diſeaſes often occur, without any apparent change in the viſible qualities of the air, and when the air <hi>appears</hi> to be more pure than at other times, when no ſuch diſeaſes prevail.</p>
                  <bibl>Lib. 17.</bibl>
                  <p>Further, altho it is generally true that peſtilence is attended and greatly augmented in violence by ſome peculiarity in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as exceſſive heat and moiſture or drouth, yet to this there are frequent exceptions. The reader may turn back to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this, recorded by Livy and other Latin hiſtorians, in which it was remarked as a matter of ſurpriſe, that a violent plague, and one of the moſt deſtructive kind, ſhould aſſail the city of Rome, in a mild, temperate ſeaſon. A ſimilar obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made reſpecting the plague in Paris in 1580. The ſummer was temperate and the fruits good. No viſible cauſe could be aſſigned for the malady. Yet a moſt certain, or rather an infallible ſymptom of a deranged ſtate of the elements, had occurred in that year; I mean a moſt ſevere univerſal influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enza. Hence it appears, that altho peculiar ſeaſons may prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly increaſe, and perhaps produce a peſtilence; yet the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral cauſe is often ſome principle which has no dependence on ſeaſon or changes of weather. In the laſt London plague, in 1665, ſays Hodge, the ſeaſon was mild, the heat moderate, and fruits abundant and good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="unknown:036687_0472_100AA4656BE08B40"/>We have, in America, proofs of the truth of this doctrin. The laſt peſtilential period commenced with the meaſles in 1789 and ſevere epidemic influenza in 1789 and 90; and has already continued ten years. Some of the ſummers, during this period, have been very temperate, as thoſe of 1794 and 1797. Yet ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſummer has produced the peſtilential fever of our climate; and even our winters have exhibited ſymptoms of the diſeaſes which prevail in ſummer. Not one year, even the moſt temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, of the whole period, has failed to ſhow the predominant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis of the peſtilence. The ſultry dry ſummers of 1793 and 98, and the ſultry humid ſummer of 1795, have rendered the diſeaſes more violent and fatal in the northern ſtates.</p>
                  <p>Yet in the more favorable ſeaſons of 1794, 96 and 97, the morbid cauſe produced its effects in New-Haven, Providence, Newburyport and Boſton, as well as in Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleſton.</p>
                  <p>Hence we obſerve that the elemental cauſe of the diſeaſes of this period, may be, in ſome degree, modified, but not control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or ſubdued by the moſt temperate and favorable ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>Indeed all writers of reputation on this ſubject agree, in this one opinion, that the plague cannot be aſcribed, either to intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſeaſons, or to putrefaction, or to any ſpecies of exhalations from animal and vegetable ſubſtances. Theſe are allowed to be ſecondary cauſes, operating to modify or vary the operation of the primary cauſe; but one uniform ſeries of obſervations from the beginning of hiſtory to this day, has driven medical writers from the defenceleſs ground of intemperate weather, and putrid exhalations.</p>
                  <p>Hippocrates learnt that peſtilence could not be aſcribed ſolely to viſible cauſes; he therefore admits <hi>to theion,</hi> ſomething divine, or beyond human inveſtigation, to be a primary cauſe of this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity.</p>
                  <p>Tacitus informs us that the plague in the time of Nero could not be aſcribed to any viſible intemperature in the ſeaſons.</p>
                  <p>Fernelius obſerves that altho immoderate heat augments the plague and every acute diſeaſe, yet he had known an exceſſively hot ſeaſon, paſs off without producing peſtilential diſeaſes. He
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:036687_0473_100AA466F12730E0"/>
agrees with Diemerbroeck, that the cauſe muſt be ſome unknown principle, "inquinamentum e coelo demiſſum," ſome cauſe of corruption in the atmoſphere, which is infuſed into it from the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial regions. This is cutting the gordian knot. Theſe authors are doubtleſs right, in rejecting the viſible qualities of the air, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations and intemperate ſeaſons, as the primary cauſes of the plague; but they fly from earth into the boundleſs regions of ſpace, for a cauſe which is more probably beneath their feet, or around their bodies.</p>
                  <p>Sennertus decides alſo moſt poſitively againſt putridity or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the humors, as the cauſe of peſtilence; and maintains <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To produce the malady, requires no corruption of the manifeſt qualities of the air.</p>
                  <bibl>Page 764.</bibl>
                  <p>Proſper Alpinus, who lived ſome time in Egypt and had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make perſonal obſervations on the diſeaſes of that country, maintains that the plague rarely ariſes from corrupt air, and never, unleſs when the Nile has exceeded its uſual limits in its inundations. If, ſays this writer, the diſeaſe proceeded from noxious exhalations from putrid ſtagnant waters and marſhes, it would occur every year, which is contrary to fact. Hence he concludes the diſeaſe to be uſually imported into Egypt from Greece, Syria and Barbary. In this opinion, he has been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a whole tribe of unobſerving travellers; who ſtupidly forget that by tracing the diſtemper from Egypt to Syria or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary, they never come nearer to its ſource. The queſtion ſtill occurs, what is its cauſe? where is its ſource? If putrid exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in Egypt will not produce the plague, will ſuch exhalations in Syria or Barbary produce it? Why trace it to theſe countries? Does any cauſe exiſt in Syria, Greece or Barbary to generate that diſeaſe, which does not exiſt in Egypt?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="unknown:036687_0474_100AA469733FE368"/>To avoid this dilemma, ſome writers inſiſt that its ſource is in Conſtantinople, where the ſeeds of it are treaſured up in old clothes, and preſerved from year to year, and from age to age. But why ſuppoſe this ſource of the diſeaſe to exiſt in Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople only? Why not the ſame ſource forever exiſt in Egypt, for there alſo infected clothes are never purified. In ſhort, from Proſper Alpinus to Mead and Cullen, all the reaſonings and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of authors on the origin of the plague, argue either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence of mind, want of obſervation or extreme prejudice.</p>
                  <p>So far as this, Alpinus is right, that exhalations alone from ſtagnant waters and marſhes will not ordinarily generate the plague; but aided by ſome general primary cauſe in the elements, ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations do produce the plague, and in no country more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than in Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Gibbon alleges this diſeaſe to proceed from hot, damp, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant air, drawing this concluſion probably from the origination of the terrible plague of 542, in the foul regions near Peluſium in Egypt, and in the vicinity of a large marſh. But if this were the only cauſe neceſſary to produce the diſorder, as Alpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus juſtly obſerves, it would occur regularly every year, for every hot ſeaſon generates putrid exhalations in ample abundance, and in every hot climate, will be found annual returns of hot, damp, ſtagnant air, The cauſes therefore aſſigned by Gibbon are inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate to the effect.</p>
                  <p>In America, beyond almoſt any other country, we have the moſt irreſiſtible arguments againſt this opinion. No country on earth, not excepting the rice plantations on the river Bengal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſuch an immenſe region of ſtagnant waters, and fetid marſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as the eaſtern ſhore of the United States, from the Delaware to Florida. The ſouthern extremity of this region is in a cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate always warm; and the whole of it is expoſed to burning heat, for four months in the year. Yet the true, "peſtis ingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria," of the oriental countries has never appeared in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as an epidemic; and the ſpecies of the plague which occurs, and which I call <hi>bilious</hi> or <hi>American,</hi> appears as rarely amidſt the marſhes of Carolina, as in the northern cities, which are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to no marſh exhalations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="unknown:036687_0475_100AA46C03E99258"/>Now if hot, damp, ſtagnant air, and putrid exhalations alone were adequate to the production of this bilious plague, it muſt be produed every year, in a multitude of places on the American coaſt; whereas in fact, that diſeaſe rarely occurs, as an epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic, even on the flat lands of Carolina and Georgia; and never is very extenſively mortal, except when the northern ſtates, which are ſituated on high, rocky, gravelly and dry lands, and whoſe air and water are of the moſt pure and ſalubrious kind, are afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo with malignant epidemic diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>This is a remarkable fact and one on which I will venture to reſt the whole argument. In no inſtance, has the city of Charleſton, ſituated on an immenſe flat, ſurrounded by the marſhes of Aſhley and Cooper rivers, been ſeverely troubled with a contagious bilious epidemic, except when the ſeaſons have been ſickly in the northern ſtates. Witneſs the years 1699, 1728, 1732, 1739, 1745, 1748, 1796. I ſpeak not of ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radic caſes among ſtrangers that viſit the ſouthern ſtates, for theſe may occur every year.</p>
                  <p>The Europeans might, had they not been blinded by the falſe notions of contagion, long ago have diſcovered the ſame import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant truth; for what is called a great plague in Egypt or Syria, never occurs, except during the prevalence of malignant epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics all over Europe, even to the Baltic. Lighter epidemics occur in Egypt and Conſtantinople, in any uncommon ſeaſon; and ſo does the ordinary autumnal bilious fever, in all our ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern ſtates. Theſe are diſorders which may be excited, in any place and any ſeaſon, by the action of heat on vegetable ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in ſtagnant water, or by the local impurities which always exiſt in populous cities. But theſe ordinary diſeaſes do not put on the malignant ſpmptoms which characterize the diſtempers of peſtilential periods—they do not exhibit infection. On the other hand, when the diſeaſes of Egypt aſſume contagious and deadly ſymptoms and ſpread deſolation over that country, we ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find the northern parts of Europe, more or leſs afflicted with the ſame or other malignant diſorders. The peſtilential principle, in greater or leſs degrees of violence, extends over the whole European world, and not unfrequently over the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican continent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="unknown:036687_0476_100AA46E1B2C4898"/>Thus, altho the plague does not, in modern times, appear in the north of Europe, at leaſt not often, yet all the great plagues in the Levant are viſible, if I may indulge the expreſſion, in the augmented bills of mortality in London, Amſterdam, and the Baltic cities. Witneſs the peſtilential periods of 1720, of 1736 to 1740, of 1760 to 1763. Even the leſs violent peſtilences of 1772 and 3, and of 1784 to 1786, have been marked by epidemics in England and Scotland. And, in the laſt ſeries of epidemics, the years 1792, 93 and 95, which have been diſtinguiſhed for the plague in the eaſt, as well as anginas and plague in America, exhibit a conſiderable increaſe of mortality in London.</p>
                  <p>All theſe facts ſerve as evidence of the truth of what the medical writers of the fifteenth, ſixteenth and ſeventeenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies have unanimouſly advanced, that the primary cauſe of peſtilence is ſome inviſible quality in the elements, altogether diſtinct from corrupt air, or marſh exhalations.</p>
                  <p>It is a remark of the Arabian phyſicians, that an indiſpoſition of the air is neceſſary, in the hotteſt climates, to enforce the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of putrid effluvia on the human body to produce the plague.</p>
                  <bibl>Mead, 248.</bibl>
                  <p>Dr. Mead himſelf, while he maintains that the putrefaction of animal ſubſtances, with unſeaſonable moiſtures, heats and want of winds, produces the plague, and while he contends that no kind of putrefaction in European countries, is ever heightened to a degree capable of producing the true plague, admits that a corrupted ſtate of air is neceſſary to give the contagious atoms their full force, otherwiſe the plague could never ceaſe, but with the extinction of mankind. That is, he holds the plague never to appear in European northern countries, without contagion, but that the contagion would remain inert, without a corrupt ſtate of the atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>The abſurd opinion, that northern climates will not generate the ſtate of air which occaſions a peſtilence, but that a peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial germ, or leaven, muſt be imported from Egypt or other ſouthern latitude, has been adopted by moſt of the Britiſh med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical writers, and by a numerous part of the phyſicians in the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:036687_0477_100AA46FA1094A68"/>
United States. It is hard to ſay whether the followers of Mead are the more ſervile, or their opinion, the more unphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical. But for my preſent purpoſe, it is ſufficient that even the advocates for the propagation of the plague by a ſpecific contagion, admit that this cauſe is not adequate to the effect, and that they are compelled to ſummon to their aid a general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of corruption in the air, to account for its propagation in northern climates. This conceſſion of the exiſtence of ſuch a principle, by whatever name it may be called, is all I aſk.</p>
                  <p>It is on this principle only, we can reconcile the differing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of authors, in regard to the effect of putrefying bodies after battles, in producing peſtilential diſeaſes; ſome alleging that ſuch corrupting bodies will produce the plague, and others denying the fact. Julius Alexandrinus, Diodorus Siculus and other authors, relate that plagues have ariſen from the putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dead bodies after battles. Three or four inſtances occur in the foregoing hiſtory, of plagues aſcribed to the putrefaction of dead locuſts. Foreſtus relates that a dead whale, caſt upon the ſhore of Holland, occaſioned an extenſive peſtilence in Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. See Hieronymus, Aguſtinus, Sabellicus, Walfius, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelus, Paraeus, and Agricola, who have recorded ſimilar facts, as cited by Diemerbroeck de peſte.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Gottwald relates that the plague which ſpread over the north of Europe from 1702 to 1711, originated near Pickzow, ſoon after the unfortunate battle between the Saxons and Swedes; but he ſays nothing of putrefying bodies, nor does he aſcribe the diſeaſe to that cauſe.</p>
                  <bibl>Baddam's Mem. 6. 5.</bibl>
                  <p>At the ſame time, it it equally true, that thouſands of dead bodies after battles have periſhed unburied, without producing any ſuch effect. In 1642, eight thouſand dead ſoldiers and innumerable carcaſes of horſes, after a battle in the Duchy of Juliers, were left to putrefy on the ſurface of the earth, cauſing an intolerable ſtench, but producing no peſtilential diſeaſe. The ſame fact happened often, ſays Diemerbroeck, p. 31, in the cruel wars, between the Swedes and Imperialiſts, in his days; and we know that other hiſtorians have related ſimilar facts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:036687_0478_100AA471D707A910"/>Whenever a malignant diſeaſe follows ſuch an extenſive pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, Diemerbroeck alleges, the diſeaſe to be only a peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential fever, but not the true plague. Or if, in any inſtance, the true plague follows, he maintains the putrefaction to be only a ſecondary cauſe. This is probably a near approach to the truth. The whole myſtery is unfolded, on my principles, which teach the exiſtence of a diſordered or peſtilential ſtate of the elements, at particular times. If the putrefaction of dead bodies takes place during theſe periods, when the animal func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are debilitated, or impaired, and the human body, prone to diſeaſe, the corruption of fleſh may ſo far vitiate the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere as to produce peſtilence. But if thouſands of dead bodies putrefy on the earth, when the air is in its natural ſtate, ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious and adapted to the ſupport of health, and when the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body is in full vigor to reſiſt the effects of the foul effluvia, it is hardly poſſible for any quantity of diſſolving fleſh to evolve a poiſon, adequate to the production of peſtilential diſorders, and certainly not ſufficient to occaſion an extenſive epidemic.</p>
                  <p>An attention to this diſtinction will alſo reconcile all the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of opinion, and all the contradictory phenomena which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the effects of vegetable effluvia, and the impure air of cities.</p>
                  <p>Why, it has been triumphantly aſked by the advocates of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported fomites, did not the filthy ſtreets and putrefying vegetables of New-York and Philadelphia, produce the bilious peſtilence, in former years? For many years, we recollect, more foul ſtreets and docks, much greater accumulations of filth, yet theſe produced not the contagious fever which has lately deſolated our cities.</p>
                  <p>Such are the facts, I admit; and the ſame will again take place, when the period of peſtilence ſhall be cloſed, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent diſorders of the elements, corrected. But there has exiſted, ſince 1789, a univerſal defect in the healthful powers of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, clearly evidenced by a ſeries of ſevere epidemics, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenza and ſcarlatina, the increaſed violence of the ſymptoms of ordinary diſtempers; by the imperfection of fruits; by the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and death of fiſh, fowls and cats, with many diſorders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other animals. The moment this ſtate of the elements oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs, the local impurities which always exiſt in cities, and which
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:036687_0479_100AA47484FF8A80"/>
produce only ordinary diſeaſes, in a healthful diſpoſition of the elements, give to thoſe diſeaſes new virulence and a contagious quality. The whole ſecret to be unfolded, is, that the autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſeaſes, under the debilitating operation of a general derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the elements, acquire unuſually ſevere ſymptoms, a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der extenſion, and the quality of contagion or what I call infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe phenomena excite the aſtoniſhment of men, who have not attended to the hiſtory of peſtilence, in which they might have found the means of ſolving the difficulty; for ſimilar facts have marked the progreſs of peſtilential diſeaſes, from the days of Moſes to this hour.</p>
                  <p>I would further obſerve that from univerſal obſervation, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that during that ſtate of air, which produces contagious diſeaſes in unuſual numbers, all kinds of fleſh and vegetables are more apt to putrefy, than in a healthy ſtate of the atmoſphere. This was obſerved by Diemerbroeck in the Holland plague of 1636; and we have had many proofs of it in America, within a few years paſt. And this is evidently true not only of freſh animal meat, but alſo of ſalted meats of all kinds. The powers of ſalt appear to be inſufficient to preſerve fleſh and fiſh, againſt the ſtrong tendency to diſſolution, which ſeems to attend them in certain years. Hence we ſo frequently hear of ſpoiled beef and pork, and fiſh during ſickly periods.</p>
                  <p>In ſome ſeaſons, it appears to be almoſt impoſſible to keep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, deſtined for a foreign market. This effect on fleſh and fiſh may proceed either from unuſual heat and moiſture in the air, or from an obvious imperfection or ſickly ſtate of the animals; and perhaps, independent of theſe cauſes, it may proceed ſometimes from the ſame inviſible principle in the properties of air, which originates new and malignant ſymptoms of diſeaſe in the human body; a mere exceſs of ſtimulus.</p>
                  <p>But whatever may be the cauſe, the effect is obvious; and the unexpected putrefaction of ſalted meats, has often been among the cauſes which have generated or augmented peſtilential diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in America. Such an inſtance is mentioned at New-Haven in 1794, where a quantity of putrid fiſh was thrown into the dock, and was exceſſively offenſive, juſt before the appearance of
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:036687_0480_100AA476AE969320"/>
the peſtilential fever. In New-York, the laſt ſummer, the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence evidently received great force and malignancy from large quantities of beef and pork which ſpoiled in ſtores and cellars. A ſimilar cauſe is ſuppoſed to have excited or increaſed the ſame diſeaſe in Boſton and New-London. The putrefaction of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of great multitudes of the fiſh called Menhaden, on the wharves in Newburyport, in 1796, was obviouſly a powerful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing cauſe of the diſorder in that town.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch caſes, putrefaction is more rapid, and its ſtench more poiſonous, than under a healthful conſtitution of the atmoſphere. This accelerated diſſolution of fleſh is the <hi>effect</hi> of the common principle of diſeaſe, and in its turn, becomes the <hi>cauſe</hi> of diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Hence we may obſerve, that it is only during a ſickly ſtate of the elements, that putrefaction is ever known to excite peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial epidemics; for almoſt every man has obſerved, many times, that the ſame quantities of putrefying fleſh, in periods of health, produce no ſuch diſtempers. It is this circumſtance which has puzzled all ſuperficial obſervers, and furniſhed the advocates of imported infection, with ſtrong ground to maintain their errors. They allege, "the ſame cauſes have not always produced the ſame effects. As putrefaction and filth have not, at other times and always, produced diſeaſes in our climate, therefore they do not produce the peſtilential fever of the preſent time, and it <hi>muſt</hi> be occaſioned by imported fomites." Theſe men have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſimilar facts in all other countries and in all ages. The ſame argument would prove that no peſtilential diſeaſe can be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated any where; for it is as true of the Weſt-Indies, of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt and Conſtantinople, as it is of the United States, that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction does not, every year and at all times, produce peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. In this fact agree all authors who have written on the cauſes of the plague. And there is reaſon to believe, with Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merbroeck, that putrefaction <hi>alone</hi> never produces the plague; but that whenever it is the <hi>apparent exciting</hi> cauſe, there concurs with it a general ſickly ſtate of the air; which not being viſible, mankind aſcribe the whole effect to putrefaction.</p>
                  <p>In the United States, it is a very curious fact, that this ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate of the elements has been progreſſive, as I have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:036687_0481_100AA478BA7A1BA8"/>
proved, in the preceding pages, which progreſſion was clearly marked by the increaſe of mortality by the ſcarlatina, and other diſeaſes of unuſual malignity. In every inſtance, the epidemic peſtilential fever, tho ſaid to ariſe from putrid fleſh, has kept pace with this inſalubrious ſtate of air. For example, while Philadelphia was ravaged by the plague in 1793, the ſcarlatina was prevalent in New-York; but the eaſtern ſtates were exempt, and felt no inconvenience from the peſtilential ſtate of the air, unleſs in a few ſporadic caſes of autumnal fever, of aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented violence, which indicated a <hi>commencement</hi> of the epidemic conſtitution. In 1794, this conſtitution arrived to its <hi>criſis</hi> in Connecticut, moving eaſtward in its progreſs; and at New-Haven appeared the peſtilential fever, ſoon after its precurſor, the ſcarlatina. Now whether we ſuppoſe the peſtilence to be from imported fomes, or from the putrid fiſh and clams in the docks, it is remarkable that it did not occur till the ſtate of air was evidently ſickly, and ill-fitted to ſupport life, as appeared by the malignant dyſentery in the vicinity, and by the univerſal prevalence of ſcarlatina. This is a curious and important fact.</p>
                  <p>Proceeding eaſtward we obſerve the ſame truth. The peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential fever at Newburyport was ſaid to be excited by the putrid garbage of fiſh—true, but this effect did not take place in 1793, when the fever was laying waſte Philadelphia; nor in 1795, when the ſame fever prevailed in New-York. Why? evidently becauſe the conſtitution of air in the eaſtern ſtates, had not then arrived to its criſis of malignancy. But moving eaſtward, the ſcarlatina began to ſhow itſelf there in 1795, and in 1796 was more general and fatal in all the adjacent country. Then follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the peſtilential fever, both in Boſton and Newburyport. So that if we admit the diſeaſe to be of imported origin, or ſuppoſe it to ariſe from putrid exhalations, we are ſtill compelled to admit the concurrence of ſome general cauſe in the production of the diſeaſe, becauſe we never know this peſtilence to appear, but when other diſeaſes and phenomena demonſtrate the exiſtence of ſuch a cauſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">If it ſhould be ſaid, that putrid fiſh might not have exiſted, in other years, in ſituations to expoſe the inhabitants; I anſwer, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my obſervation, in numberleſs inſtances, immenſe quantities of the entrails of fiſh are left to putrefy on the ſhores of our rivers, every year, with an intolerable ſtench, but without producing the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of diſeaſe.</note> In Philadelphia, in New-Haven, and in almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:036687_0482_100AA47A56B33FB0"/>
place, the peſtilential fever has followed cloſe upon the heels of that malignant diſtemper, the ſcarlet fever.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the duration of this general conſtitution of air, we can determin nothing, but by the event. We obſerve in hiſtory, that ſuch peſtilential periods are of various length, from three to fifteen years, or perhaps for a longer time; during which, diſeaſes are multiplied and augmented; and all bearing ſome peculiar ſymptoms, that characterize that conſtitution or ſtate of the elements. On this ſubject the treatiſe of Sydenham is invaluable.</p>
                  <p>There remains one other view of this ſubject to be conſidered in this ſection—this is, the connection of peſtilential diſeaſes with famin.</p>
                  <p>Moſt authors have remarked that famin is a cauſe of peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence, and have cited the old Greek adage, <hi>o loimos meta limon,</hi> peſtis poſt famem, the plague follows famin.</p>
                  <p>It is a juſt remark that the true plague often follows a dearth of proviſions; it is more frequently true, that ſcarcity is followed by diſeaſes of a leſs malignant type But it is equally true that this order is often inverted, and famin follows peſtilence. It is more frequently true that peſtilence is neither preceded nor followed by any ſcarcity of proviſions. Inſtances of all theſe facts appear in the preceding hiſtory. The concluſion is inevitable, that the plague proceeds from ſome other cauſe, than a deficient or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant quantity of food, for it often occurs, independent of either of theſe circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Thus Morellus, de feb. peſt. lib. 3, relates an inſtance, where no peſtilential diſeaſes ſucceeded a ſevere famin. Galen men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions an inſtance of a ſevere famin which followed as ſevere a plague in Rome, yet the famin did not again excite the plague.</p>
                  <p>De Pauw, in his Philoſophical Diſſertations on the Egyptians and Chineſe, vol. 1. 87, anſwers and refutes the Abbe Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont who alleged famin to be the cauſe of the plague.</p>
                  <p>"By exact annotations, ſays De Pauw, continued during
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:036687_0483_100AA47CE4938E50"/>
twenty-eight years, we find the plague has raged in Egypt five times, without being preceded by any ſcarcity of food, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what I once ſuſpected, unreſtricted to a periodical courſe." We know alſo in America, that ſcarcity of food can have had no influence in producing the numerous epidemic and peſtilential diſorders of the laſt nine years.</p>
                  <p>On this ſubject Diemerbroeck has a very juſt remark, and one that ſolves all the difficulties that might ſeem to ariſe from the differing accounts of the effects of famin. He ſays "Non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, ſed illam tantum famem ſequitur peſtis, quae fames et ipſa a peſtilentiae cauſa originem ſumit, (dum a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ea cauſa primo fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges terrae corrumpuntur, poſtea peſtis inducitur,) ita ut fames illa non ſit cauſa peſtis, ſed ipſamet eandem cum peſte cauſam habeat."</p>
                  <bibl>De peſte, page 30.</bibl>
                  <p>"For the plague does not follow every famin; but that only which ariſes from the ſame cauſe as the plague; (for by that cauſe the fruits of the earth are firſt vitiated and afterwards the plague ſucceeds) ſo that the famin is not the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the plague, but proceeds itſelf from the ſame cauſe."</p>
                  <p>Whenever there exiſts a general cauſe in the elements, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to the health of the human race, and at the ſame time, to the growth and perfection of grain, peſtilence and famin may be companions of each other; or they may reciprocally follow each other, according as the general cauſe operates firſt on ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables or on mankind. In ſuch caſes, ſuperficial obſervers are apt to ſuppoſe one to be the cauſe of the other, when in fact, they are both the offspring of a common cauſe.</p>
                  <p>In long ſieges, bad food is often a powerful cauſe of diſeaſe, as in the ſiege of Marſeilles by Julius Ceſar, before Chriſt 48. Ceſar, De bel. civ. lib. 2. 20. In ſuch caſes, the bad qualities of the corn or bread, are not natural defects in the growth, but the effects of age, heat, moiſture and decay.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately, the improved ſtate of agriculture has rendered a dearth of grain, a rare occurrence. In deſpotic governments, where induſtry of every kind languiſhes, and men ſeldom make proviſion for ſubſiſtence beyond the paſſing moment, famin is not unfrequent in modern times, as in Syria after the terribly ſevere
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:036687_0484_100AA47EEC2EFD48"/>
winter of 1756-7, when the crops failed, and parents devoured their children, or offered them for ſale in market to procure food. But ſuch is the ſtate of agriculture, in free countries, that crops are leſs liable to fail, than formerly; and when they fall ſhort in a particular country, commerce may uſually ſupply the deficiency from ſome other climate. A univerſal failure of grain, even under the moſt unfavorable diſpoſition of the elements, muſt be a rare phenomenon.</p>
                  <p>Yet with all our improvements in agriculture and commerce, we are not to calculate with certainty that we are never to feel the ſcourge of famin. There has been, within about a century, a ſucceſſion of ſeaſons when the earth failed to yield her accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed quantity of vegetable food. Such were the laſt years of the laſt century, when corn was cut ſhort by mildew and blaſt, not in one country only, but in moſt countries. Multitudes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in the north of Europe, and our forefathers in America obſerved, that for a number of years, the very courſe of nature ſeemed to be altered.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of the ſeventeenth century was diſtinguiſhed by a ſtill more extenſive and ſevere dearth, which afflicted all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and cut off a large portion of its inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1783, the dearth in Scotland was ſo ſevere that commerce alone ſaved thouſands from periſhing; and ſo late as the year 1790, our own country experienced a ſcarcity that excited univerſal alarm. Both of theſe periods were diſtinguiſhed for ſevere famin in Egypt, Bengal and the Carnatic.</p>
                  <p>Such facts ſhow us the all-powerful influence of the inviſible energies of nature, and how little avail human efforts, to avoid the fatal conſequences of a univerſal failure in their operation. That the principles of vegetation do thus fail, at certain times, over large portions of the globe, is an unqueſtionable truth; it is equally certain, that ſuch events are intimately connected with the cauſe of peſtilence among men. Hence we obſerve that men and cattle often periſh with epidemic diſeaſes, when veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables fail to yield their cuſtomary fruits.</p>
                  <p>It is not however the <hi>want</hi> of food which occaſions diſeaſes, ſo frequently as the bad quality of it. Next to the corrupt ſtate
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:036687_0485_100AA4809583C830"/>
of air, ſays Riverius, unwholeſome aliments are the cauſes of peſtilent diſeaſes. Vegetables may acquire unwholeſome quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from too much or too little moiſture, or from other unknown cauſes. Grain of a good quality may alſo degenerate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unwholeſome, by heat and moiſture, after it is gathered, as in magazines, granaries, or holds of ſhips. Such corn may produce diſeaſes in thoſe who feed upon it.</p>
                  <p>But it is doubtful whether mere want of food ever produced a contagious diſeaſe. Seamen who ſuffer and even periſh at ſea, in a wholeſome air, thro mere hunger, pine away and die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſeaſe. Whenever contagious diſtempers accompany dearth, there is uſually a concurrence of other cauſes to produce the effect.</p>
                  <p>We may therefore conſider the propoſition of Diemerbroeck as correct, that famin does not produce the plague, but proceeds from the ſame cauſe; yet that ſcarcity of food and ſtill more certainly, food of a bad quality, may produce diſeaſes of a leſs malignant type, or very much augment, in violence and extent, the current diſorders of a particular ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Yet here again our ſenſes may deceive us. Corn of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently bad quality, does not always generate diſeaſe. A ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king inſtance of this is related in Sinclair's Scotland, vol. 7. 605. Froſt, rain and ſnow had turned the corn black; it was diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the taſte; the ſtraw was equally affected; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man nor beaſt ſuffered by feeding on them—ſo little do we know of the cauſe of diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Intimately connected with the ſubject of vegetable nutriment, is the conſideration of diſeaſes among cattle. Whenever graſs is defective in wholeſome, nutritious qualities, horſes, horn-cattle and ſheep are ſure to ſuffer by mortal diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>It is often mentioned in the foregoing pages, and a fact that every man may have obſerved, that when contagious diſeaſes prevail among men, ſimilar diſorders prevail more or leſs among cattle. Very few of the plagues in ancient Rome, affected one ſpecies of animals, without ſhowing the peſtilential principle in others. The ſame remark may be made, in all ages, and is true at the preſent period. Sometimes the peſtilence invades one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of animals firſt—ſometimes another; ſometimes the diſeaſes
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:036687_0486_100AA4829C377320"/>
will be more general and ſevere among men, and ſometimes among cattle; but ſeldom do we obſerve one ſpecies of animals ſeverely affected, and the other totally exempt.</p>
                  <p>So far as my reading and obſervations enable me to judge, diſeaſes among cattle uſually ſucceed exceſſive or unſeaſonable humidity in the air. The years 1712 and 13, when a plague deſtroyed a vaſt proportion of the cattle in Italy, and great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Germany, are noted in England, to have been wet and cold. What was the ſtate of the air in the countries where the diſeaſe was moſt fatal, I am not informed. The ſhort account I have ſeen of it, abridged from Ramazzini, in the 6th volume of Baddam's Memoirs, makes no mention of the weather or ſeaſons; and Lanciſius, who has alſo left many particulars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting it, is not before me. The diſeaſe however was a true plague, characterized with many of the ſymptoms of plague in the human body. Authors all agree that the diſtemper was prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated ſolely by contagion from a ſingle cow, from Dalmatia; and they are ſo well contented with this idea, that they tell us little or nothing from which we can collect the cauſe. Like the writers on the cauſe of the plague in Egypt, who trace it to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary or Syria, and there leave the ſubject; ſo Lanciſius and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazzini, tell us the diſtemper, which deſtroyed moſt of the cattle in Italy, came from one cow, in a drove from Dalmatia; and there they ſtop ſhort, without a ſyllable to explain why the cow from Dalmatia was ſeized.</p>
                  <p>All theſe contagion-ſticklers reſemble the Indian, who, when aſked what the world ſtands on, replied, on an elephant—the elephant, on a great turtle, and the turtle, on the ocean. Here he ſtopped, and as to what ſupports the ocean, he leaves us in the dark.</p>
                  <p>The general viſible cauſe of peſtilential diſeaſes among cattle, as before remarked, ſeems to be an exceſs of moiſture, which renders their food watery and unſubſtantial. The ſummer of 1751, a year of remarkable mortality among the cattle in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was cold and rainy. Such was the ſeaſon in 1348, which was followed by a great loſs of ſheep, as well as by peſtilence among men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="unknown:036687_0487_100AA48533A63E88"/>Yet all wet ſeaſons do not produce the ſame effect; and we are conſtrained to reſort, for the cauſe, to unſeen properties in the air or the food on which the cattle ſubſiſt.—That the ſame general cauſe affects cattle and the human race, in times of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, is obvious from the analogy of ſymptoms in their diſeaſes. During the preſent ſickly period in America, horſes and horned cattle have died, in many parts of the country, with diſeaſes which are characterized with bilious appearances; in analogy with all the diſorders which have affected men, during the ſame period.</p>
                  <p>Lanciſius and Ramazzini would have treated the ſubject of the diſeaſe among horſes and cattle in Italy, in 1712 and 13, much more like philoſophers and men of ſound ſcience, if, inſtead of telling how much miſchief an infected cow had done, and how the diſeaſe had been ſpread, by farriers, by dogs and by ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, they had deſcribed to us the ſeaſons, the ſtate of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the diſeaſes which prevailed among mankind. They ought at leaſt to have connected, with the diſeaſe among cattle, an extenſive plague among men which was then raging in Vienna, Hungary, and other countries, as it had been, for ſeveral years before, over all the Poliſh and Baltic territories.</p>
                  <p>The frequent prevalence of mortal epidemics among the brutes, is an obvious and irreſiſtible proof of ſome deleterious principle in the elements, which is adequate to the production of the worſt diſeaſes, and the deſtruction of life, independent of every arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The brutes, if left to themſelves, follow implicitly, a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their nature, called inſtinct. They eat what nature inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them, and never feed on what is pernicious to their health; nor will they injure themſelves by eating too much or too little of their ordinary food. Governed by ſuch a law, they can be liable to no diſeaſes, but ſuch as muſt neceſſarily proceed from the air they breathe, the water they drink, or the vegetables they eat, all of which are ordinarily good, nutritious, and well fitted to ſupport ſound health. Their diſeaſes therefore muſt proceed from ſome imperfection in theſe elements of life, which is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by natural cauſes. This proceſs of reaſoning appears to
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:036687_0488_100AA48744C50608"/>
be ſtrictly logical and correct. The concluſions from it are inev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itable. If a ſtate of the elements does ever exiſt, which can produce diſeaſes that deſtroy the lives of the brutes, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion or any artificial cauſe, we may ſafely allege that a ſtate of the elements may exiſt in any latitude which is adequate to the production of the moſt formidable maladies, that ever affect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>The analogies of the animal economy, and continual obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations forbid us to ſuppoſe the powers of life in the beaſts of the field, leſs perfect, or more eaſily diſſolved, than thoſe of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race. On the contrary, from their following their natural undepraved appetites, in the uſe of food and in all their actions, their bodies may be ſuppoſed to be more firm and perfect than thoſe of men, who are uſually debilitated by irregularities in living, and other deviations from the laws of nature. If then irrational animals are ſubject to the invaſions of mortal epidemic diſeaſes, which mow them down by thouſands, in defiance of the firm texture of their bodies, and their regular living, a fortiori the human race muſt be liable to deſtruction by ſimilar means.</p>
                  <p>This reaſoning is certainly juſt and ſubſtantial, whatever may be its fate in convincing the reader; and it proves that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral operation of ſome ſecret principle in the elements, is ſufficient to account for the moſt deſtructive maladies, in every latitude on the globe, without reſorting to the tranſportation of fomites from ſome one heaven-ſcourged country to more favored regions.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Mead and all his ſervile admirers who believe him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inveſtigating his aſſertions, allege that putrefaction never riſes, in England, to a degree that is neceſſary to generate a peſtilence. But if any man can believe that putrefaction, as writers are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to call the principle of deſtruction, can riſe high enough in the grades of malignity, to produce a plague or contagious mortal diſtemper among cattle in England, and at the ſame time, never affect the human ſpecies, he muſt have more pride in the ſuperem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent ſtation of man in the ſcale of being, than I poſſeſs. The argument from facts is evidently in favor of the theory, which ſubjects all animals, in this reſpect, to the ſame laws; and the
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:036687_0489_100AA4894CC6C468"/>
analogies of creation will not authorize man to claim the high privilege of exemption from the general laws of the animal econ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omy. —It is an unqueſtionable truth, that men as well as brutes, in all latitudes, are often invaded with contagious and deadly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, under the operation of the elements, without the leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of contagion from ſouthern climates or any foreign country. Multitudes of facts warrant this deduction; but the progreſſion in the violence of epidemic diſeaſes, the imperfection of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the ſickneſs and death of fiſh in rivers and the ocean, and of cattle on land, are proofs of the truth of my principle, which bid defiance to oppoſition.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XVI. Of Contagion and Infection.</head>
                  <p>NO point on the ſubject of diſeaſes has been more agitated among medical writers, than that of the contagion of the plague, inguinal and bilious.</p>
                  <p>Hippocrates has left no deciſive opinion on this queſtion, but thoſe who maintain the plague not to be contagious, rely on this ſilence of the father of medicin, as an argument in their favor.</p>
                  <p>Galen's opinion was clearly in favor of the contagiouſneſs of certain diſeaſes. "Quodque periculoſa ſit converſatio cum labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantibus peſtilenti morboquum nimirum is non ſecus fit contagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, quam ſcabies aut lippitudo."<note n="*" place="bottom">In another tranſlation, the latter part of this paſſage ſtands thus; "periculum enim eſt, ne concipiatur, ut ſcabies et lippitudo."</note> p. 379. The author doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſpeaks here of other peſtilent diſeaſes, beſides the inguinal plague, according to the practice of the ancients who gave the name of <hi>peſtilence</hi> to other malignant diſtempers, when epidemic. His opinion however was that the plague originates in a putridity of the air, inhaled by the breath. "Lues ipſa, ab aeris putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine exorta, per inſpirationes inſiliens, haud unum aut alterum hominem, ſed plures quoque civitates depaſcit, vaſtat, et popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur." p. 627. In another paſſage, he remarks, that peſtilent diſeaſes proceed from a ſtate of the atmoſphere. "Peſtilentes morbi a coeli ſtatu proſiciſcantur."</p>
                  <p>This author obſerved that peſtilential epidemics muſt have ſome cauſe more powerful and extenſive, than contagion, or infection.</p>
                  <p>Ariſtotle was clearly of opinion that the plague is contagious, and the reaſon he aſſigns why peſtilence alone is communicated from perſon to perſon, is, that this is the only diſeaſe which is
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:036687_0491_100AA48DE3A00690"/>
common to all men. This is not very clear or ſatisfactory; but he ſpeaks of fomites proceeding from the ſick, and infecting others.</p>
                  <bibl>See Problem, ſect. 1.</bibl>
                  <p>Procopius was not a phyſician, but is eſteemed as a hiſtorian. He alleges that in 543, the mortal plague in Conſtantinople was not contagious, and that phyſicians and attendants on the ſick, did not contract the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand Thucydides, has declared unequivocally that the plague in Athens was very contagious. Evagrius alſo has related that the diſeaſe, in his time, was very contagious, to particular perſons, while others eſcaped, even againſt their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination. Livy alſo was decidedly in favor of the doctrin of contagion.</p>
                  <p>Petrus Salius Diverſus, cited by Diemerbroeck, was of the opinion, that the plague is ſometimes contagious; at other times, not. Seneca held to the contagious nature of peſtilence. So ſays Ovid, Metamorph. 7.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Quo proprior quiſque eſt, ſervitque fidelius aegro,</l>
                     <l>In partem lethi citius venit.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>The nearer we approach, and the more faithfully we ſerve, the diſeaſed, the ſooner we fall victims to the diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who oppoſe the doctrin of contagion, not only produce as authority, the ſilence of Hippocrates, with Avicenna, and other Arabian phyſicians, on the ſubject; but they allege, that if the plague was a contagious diſeaſe, it would <hi>always</hi> infect thoſe who have communication with the diſeaſed. But this they aver to be contrary to fact; and they inſtance the eſcape of many phyſicians, ſurgeons, grave-diggers, hearſe-men, and others. They argue further, that as the breath and effluvia of perſons in health, will not expel the poiſon of the plague from the diſeaſed; ſo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n the other hand, the effluvia from the infected, cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ſeeds of the diſorder into a healthy body.</p>
                  <p>Gregory Nyſſen, a celebrated philoſopher and theologian, concludes, that thoſe who are ſeized with the plague, after an intercourſe with the diſeaſed, contract it from the ſame ſtate of the air, which occaſioned the diſtemper in the ſick, and not from the effluvia exhaled from the infected body. While I cannot
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:036687_0492_100AA48F69337C40"/>
aſſent to this opinion, in the utmoſt latitude, I firmly believe it contains a great deal of truth.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck, de peſte p. 44, ſuggeſts that the ancient phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, who paſſed over the ſubject of the contagion of the plague, called that quality only <hi>contagion,</hi> which communicates diſeaſe by immediate contact, as in caſe of the itch, leproſy, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drophobia and the like; whereas the plague infects more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently through the medium of the air, vapors, garments and other objects. Thus the ſweat, exhalations, and excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious matter of the ſick corrupt the air, and this infected air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the means of diſeaſe to perſons in health who breathe it. This, ſays Diemerbroeck, the ancients did not call contagion, proceeding from the diſeaſed, but they conſidered healthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons taking the diſtemper through this medium, as infected by the malignity of the air.</p>
                  <p>Almoſt all modern phyſicians however agree in the opinion that the plague is a contagious diſeaſe, as Foreſtus, Proſper Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus, Diemerbroeck, Sydenham, and a multitude of others; and on this general opinion, have been inſtituted quarantine laws and other regulations for preſerving cities and countries from the diſeaſe. Of the value of theſe regulations, we ſhall be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to judge, after taking a careful ſurvey of the queſtion relative to the force and effects of contagion.</p>
                  <p>Within a few years, one author has ventured again to call in queſtion the received opinions on this ſubject. Dr. Maclean, in a ſmall treatiſe, has attempted to prove that the plague, dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and epidemic fevers are never propagated by contagion. Contagion he defines to be "a ſpecific matter generated in a perſon affected with diſeaſe, and capable of communicating that particular diſeaſe, with or without contact, to another."</p>
                  <p>This author's general arguments are theſe, That ſpecific con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion muſt neceſſarily act and communicate a diſeaſe from a ſick to a well perſon, within a certain diſtance—that in the plague, dyſentery and epidemic fevers, a ſmall proportion of people, expoſed to the action of effluvia from the diſeaſed, are ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the diſtempers, and therefore ſuch diſorders are not contagious. He conſiders thoſe diſeaſes only as contagious,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:036687_0493_100AA491720BD808"/>
which can be received but once by the ſame perſon; as the ſmall-pox and meaſles. He affirms that the exiſtence of contagion in plague, dyſentery and fevers, has been uniformly taken for granted, not only without proof, but even contrary to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of numerous and convincing facts. He lays it down as a truth, that all epidemic and peſtilential diſeaſes, which may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a perſon more than once in his life, are cauſed by certain ſtates or viciſſitudes of the atmoſphere, producing indirect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
                  <p>The variety of opinions on this ſubject argues either a want of accurate obſervations among medical men, or of accurate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions in terms. The various powers of diſeaſes to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate themſelves, either have not been underſtood, or they have been imperfectly defined. Let us then attend to facts, the only genuin ſource of knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. We obſerve that the contagion of the meaſles and ſmall-pox, takes effect with great certainty, whenever a perſon in health, who has never been affected, approaches ſufficiently near to a diſeaſed perſon. I do not ſay it <hi>always</hi> takes effect; for there are a few exceptions; but theſe are ſo rare, as not to impeach the generality of the fact, or principle.</p>
                  <p>The contagion of the plague, dyſentery and violent fevers, does not, under circumſtances equally favorable, take effect with the like certainty. On the contrary, a great proportion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons expoſed to the effluvia of the ſick, entirely eſcape the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. The contagion of ſmall-pox and meaſles, is not ſenſibly affected in its operation by heat or cold, moiſture or drouth. It acts with the ſame certainty in winter as in ſummer, and in every variety of temperature.</p>
                  <p>The contagion of plague, dyſentery and typhus fevers, on the other hand, depends almoſt entirely on heat for its activity, and is ſubdued, rendered inert, or totally extinguiſhed by cold. Hence an eſſential difference in the two ſpecies of contagion— that of the ſmall-pox and meaſles being an eſſential quality of the diſeaſes; while that of the other diſeaſes is an accidental cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="unknown:036687_0494_100AA49332906D70"/>Thirdly. The contagion of the plague often diſcriminates between the natives of particular countries, or men of a partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular blood, or family, ſeizing one and paſſing by another, and this through the whole courſe of an epidemic; but the ſmall-pox and meaſles make no ſuch diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. The contagion of the ſmall-pox and meaſles is not deſtroyed by the purity of the atmoſphere; it acts with the ſame certainty on the moſt ſalubrious hills, as in the moſt impure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of poverty.</p>
                  <p>Not ſo the contagion of the plague, and dyſentery; for as a general rule, theſe diſeaſes are not propagated in a pure atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere. With reſpect to the plague, ſome e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ceptions exiſt; but it is the uſual fact, that theſe laſt named diſeaſes will not ſpread by contagion in a wholeſome ſtate of the air. By removing the ſick, from a city into the country, or otherways placing him in an airy room, and preſerving it clean, with all the apparel and utenſils, the contagion is ſo diſſipated or attenuated, as to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered harmleſs; the attendants eſcape, and the diſeaſe is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed with the death or recovery of the patient.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly. The contagion of the ſmall-pox and meaſles can never act but once on the ſame perſon. Its firſt operation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the capacity of receiving it a ſecond time. The excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to this rule are too few to deſerve conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Totally different is the effect of the plague and dyſentery, for inſtead of fortifying the body againſt a ſecond attack, theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes debilitate the animal powers, and render the patient more ſuſceptible of the contagion in a ſubſequent year. It is admitted by all correct obſervers, that the plague may be received by the ſame perſon, times without limits; a perſon in Conſtantinople died of the twelfth attack; and many perſons, in the late plagues in America, have been affected two or three times. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to dyſentery and other contagious fevers, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy on this point.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly. The contagion of the ſmall-pox and meaſles, if it takes the leaſt effect, produces the diſeaſe complete. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected patient may be affected more lightly than the infecting perſon, and the degrees of violence in the ſymptoms may be very
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:036687_0495_100AA497DC953708"/>
vatious; but the diſeaſe produced, will always be completely formed, and of the ſame ſpecific type, as that from which it is communicated.</p>
                  <p>The contagion of the plague and dyſentery, has not the ſame certainty in its effect. The contagion of the plague very often produces only a nauſea and vomiting—ſometimes an inferior grade of fever, as an intermitting or remitting fever, of which I have myſelf ſeen examples—very often its effects are limited to dizzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the head, or ſevere pains in the glands—and ſometimes it has produced external eruptions, without any other material affection; as in the celebrated Diemerbroeck, who, in the grievous plague at Nimeguen, was affected with a carbuncle on his left hand, while in good health. In 1796, I ſaw an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in New-York, in which the infection of the peſtilential fever had occaſioned a ſingular ſwelling and inflammation in the face of a nurſe, who eſcaped the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly. We may perhaps add, what Diemerbroeck and other writers conſider as eſſential to give effect to the contagion of the plague, and dyſentery, an apt or ſuitable diſpoſition in the ſound body to receive the contagion. Some peculiar ſtate of a body in health is evidently neceſſary to the operation of the infecting principle of the plague; this is agreed by all authors. But it does not appear that any ſuch ſtate or diſpoſition is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to give effect to the contagion of ſmall-pox or meaſles, which acts upon all bodies, within the reach of their effluvia. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration may be the cauſe of the firſt diſtinction before recited; and a few exceptions exiſt to the propoſition in regard to the ſmall-pox and meaſles, which, tho rarely, fail of operating on bodies in health.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are important diſtinctions, which, had they been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by medical writers, would have prevented the enormous errors of Mead and others, who maintain that the plague is prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated, in northern countries, by ſpecific contagion only. The truth is, the plague is a contagious diſeaſe, like dyſentery, and moſt typhus fevers, but the contagion is <hi>not ſpecific.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Specific contagion I define to be, a quality of a diſeaſe, which, within a ſuitable diſtance, communicates it from a body affected
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:036687_0496_100AA49546C9D6B8"/>
with it, to a ſound body, with great certainty, and under all circumſtances of ſeaſon, weather or ſituation. Such is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of the ſmall-pox and meaſles. This contagion is of two kinds; firſt, that which acts by contact only, as that of the itch, leproſy, hydrophobia and ſiphilis; ſecondly, that which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces its effect, with equal certainty, by near approach, as that of ſmall-pox and meaſles. The contagion of the angina maligna approaches to the ſpecific kind; and if it is true, as ſome modern phyſicians have aſſerted, that perſons can never be affected with it, more than once, it comes under the character of a <hi>ſpecific</hi> contagion, but I doubt the fact. Several perſons in Bethlem, were affected with the ſcarlatina anginoſa twice, during the late epidemic; firſt in 1793 and again in 1794.</p>
                  <bibl>Medical Repoſitory, vol. 1. 525.</bibl>
                  <p>That quality of a diſeaſe which may or may not excite it in a ſound body, within a ſuitable diſtance, or by contact; and which depends on heat, foul air, an apt diſpoſition in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving body, or other contingent circumſtances, and which may excite the diſeaſe in the ſame perſon more than once, is certainly a very diſtinct ſpecies of contagion, from that of the ſmall-pox, and to this I give the denomination of <hi>infection.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With a diſtinction of this ſort, which ſeems to have been firſt adopted by an eminent phyſician in New-York, Dr. Bailey, in his treatiſe on the fever of 1795 page 38, and which is unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably well founded, we have no difficulty in explaining all the phenomena of contagion, which have given riſe to diſputes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number and to the moſt contradictory opinions. The plague, glandular and bilious, the dyſentery, typhus fevers, and the milder kinds of angina, are not <hi>ſpecifically contagious,</hi> but they are <hi>infectious.</hi> They will not and do not propagate themſelves in all ſituations, but the operation of the infecting quality is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled by a multitude of contingent circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. It is admitted on all hands, that a ſuitable and partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular conſtitution of air, is neceſſary to render the plague epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic in northern latitudes. Thus Sydenham ſuppoſes this diſeaſe to be conveyed by peſtilential particles from one place to another, but not to become epidemic, unleſs favored by the conſtitution of
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:036687_0497_100AA49964987820"/>
air. One ground of his opinion ſeems to have been a fact rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Mead, that when the diſeaſe has raged violently in one town, in the ſame climate, a neighboring town has totally eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, by forbiding intercourſe with the infected place, as once happened in Tuſcany.—This fact will be afterwards conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Mead alſo, while he declares his opinion that the plague is ſpread by ſpecific contagion only, like ſmall-pox and meaſles, and that all plagues are to be traced to Egypt, very inconſiſtently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits that a certain corruption of the air is neceſſary to give the contagious atoms their full force.</p>
                  <p>Theſe opinions are utterly incongruous; for if the plague poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes ſpecific contagion, like the ſmall-pox, then a corrupt ſtate of air is <hi>not</hi> neceſſary to give full force to the contagion; for no ſuch ſtate of air is requiſite to give force to the contagion of the ſmall-pox. It ſpreads with as much certainty in pure air, as in foul air. Mead's principles therefore overthrow his own theory. But he was driven to admit ſome general conſtitution of air, to be neceſſary to the propagation of the plague, becauſe he had learnt from reading that the plague will not ſpread in all places, at all times and under all circumſtances. In truth, Mead never had an idea of the difference between the ſpecies of contagion; and the ſame may be ſaid of moſt modern writers.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>It is a moſt extraordinary circumſtance that the Britiſh authors, in modern days, ſhould all agree that a favorable conſtitution of air is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to propagate the plague, and yet that no plague is bred in north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern climates. They muſt admit and do admit, that ſuch a favorable ſtate of air has often exiſted in all parts of Europe; this is a kind of half way buſineſs; allowing northern climates the power of creating and preparing a condition of atmoſphere that ſhall meet the plague half-way.</p>
                        <p>But will it be denied that the petechial fever and angina maligna originate in northern latitudes? I preſume not. Then the condition of air is admitted to produce <hi>moſt deadly infectious</hi> diſeaſes, but not <hi>the moſt deadly of all.</hi> Kind heaven, in mercy to the northern world, has permitted the elements to generate diſeaſes almoſt as bad as the plague, but not quite.</p>
                        <p>I then aſk, does not the production of the angina maligna ſuppoſe as deleterious a principle in the air, as that of the plague? Is not the diſeaſe as fatal to youth, and more certainly infectious or contagious? This cannot be denied. That diſeaſe ſometimes deſtroys as great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of patients ſeized as the plague, and is more certainly conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to youth? Beſides this diſtemper depends not on local cauſes, but wholly on a condition of the elements; it therefore implies a moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial alteration in the atmoſphere.</p>
                        <p>Further, if petechial fever is generated in northern climates, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates the power of thoſe climates to produce the plague; for it has been proved, that this fever is the ſame ſpecies of diſeaſe, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens turns to the plague. It has done this, very often in England and on the Baltic.</p>
                        <p>Infection ſpreads certain diſeaſes, and ought to be avoided; but med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical men have aſcribed ten times more effects to that cauſe, than it ever produced. The ſame principle which generates the angina maligna or plague, in one inſtance, muſt be competent to produce it in all other perſons of like diſpoſition and habits.</p>

                     <pb n="143" facs="unknown:036687_0498_100AA49BE2337A58"/>Sanctorious, cited by Van Swieten, remarked that the rays of the plague may be removed by the wind, yet he was ſurpriſed to obſerve that theſe rays from the body of a diſeaſed perſon, are never diſturbed by the force of the air. I do not perfectly reconcile theſe remarks; but it is an indubitable fact, that a peſtilential ſtate of air, when clearly and diſtinctly formed in a city, is not diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor very greatly affected by the moſt violent winds. It has ſometimes been remarked, that the peſtilential fever in American cities, has been ſpread by particular winds; but it has ſpread not only before, but againſt the wind, tho perhaps with leſs rapidity. Certain it is, that no force of wind whatever ever expels from a town, or leſſens the peſtilential virus without the aid of other cauſes. Of this we have had repeated proofs in America.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps we may explain this fact, and reconcile the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Sanctorius, on the principle I have unfolded; by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the effluvia of the ſick to be, in ſome degree, capable of diſſipation by the wind, which is undoubtedly true; but that the elemental cauſe of peſtilence, which conſiſts in the eſſential prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties of the atmoſphere, is not ſubject to diſperſion or removal by the winds. This conſideration would involve a curious queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz. whether, in the apparent motion of air, called wind, the whole maſs of the ſurrounding atmoſphere is moved, or whether it is the vapor, or other component parts of the air only, which are moved, while the fire or electric fluid remains ſtation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. But whatever may be the cauſe, the fact is certain, that the peſtilential principle, during a plague in a city or town, is never expelled by winds. A moſt violent, cool north-weſt wind ſwept the city of New-York, on the 19th and 20th of September 1795, without any conſiderable abatement of the peſtilential fever. This fact adds no ſmall weight to my opinion, that the primary cauſe
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:036687_0499_100AA49EA50F2308"/>
of ſuch diſeaſes, is in the eſſential combination of the component parts of the atmoſphere.<note n="*" place="bottom">Warm ſoutherly rains however high the wind, uſually increaſe the violence of the diſeaſe, by inducing debility and giving activity to the local cauſes, as noxious effluvia from vegetable ſubſtances. Cool north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly winds, <hi>accompanied with heavy rains,</hi> leſſen the morbid action of the peſtilential principle; and if late in the ſeaſon, and not ſucceeded by very warm weather, may entirely remove it. A violent tornado, with great rain, on the 8th of October 1797, was ſuppoſed to put a ſtep to the peſtilential fever in Providence.

                  </p>
                  <p>Sanctorius further obſerves that "things infected with the plague, communicate the diſeaſe, as long as the proximate and remote cauſes ſubſiſt; one of which ceaſing, the infection ceaſes." This is an explicit acknowledgment that the contagion is not <hi>ſpecific,</hi> but dependent on ſome other cauſe, agreeable to the doctrin of Sydenham.</p>
                  <p>This principle is verified moſt remarkably in Egypt, as appears by all the authors who have written on the ſubject. They are all conſtrained to admit, even when they allege the plague to be not native in that country, that, if imported at certain ſeaſons of the year, it will not ſpread. Proſper Alpinus expreſsly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that the plague is <hi>never imported in the months of June, July and Auguſt;</hi> "nunquam viſa eſt peſtis illuc ex infectis lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis profecta;" altho he maintains that the diſeaſe is almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imported.</p>
                  <p>This is certainly a moſt extraordinary aſſertion, and unworthy of the reputation of the writer. What in the name of ſenſe and conſiſtency, ſhould prevent the ſeeds of ſuch a diſeaſe from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "imported" in a particular ſeaſon, when veſſels are paſſing continually between that country and infected places? The idea betrays extreme weakneſs or prejudice.</p>
                  <p>Savary in his letters on Egypt has detailed the true ſtate of facts. He ſaw veſſels, which arrived in Egypt from Turkey, in the month of Auguſt, and landed their infected goods and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without communicating the diſeaſe. He informs us, that it is an obſervation of ages, that infected merchandize brot into Egypt, in the months of June, July and Auguſt, do not excite the plague, but the diſeaſe expires of itſelf. If introduced at
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:036687_0500_100B2C571C8E6108"/>
other ſeaſons, and communicated, it ceaſes; but if imported in winter, it ſpreads.</p>
                  <p>The author has here ſtated effects or phenomena, with a good degree of accuracy; but has entirely miſtaken the cauſe. It is wholly the ſtate of air, in different ſeaſons, and not infection, which occaſions theſe varieties.</p>
                  <p>Mackenzie, in an account of the plague in Conſtantinople, tho a firm believer in its contagion, declares "that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th in that city and in Smyrna, the plague breaks out in ſome years, when it is not poſſible to trace whence it is conveyed." This is doubtleſs true; yet neither this fact, nor the known fact that contagion in Egypt will not operate in a certain ſeaſon of the year, has ever opened the eyes of European authors to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of the current notions about the ſpecific contagion of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>A fact related by Patrick Ruſſel, in his hiſtory of the plague at Aleppo in 1760, is full to the ſame point, that the contagion of the plague, will not take effect, without the aid of other cauſes. In 1759, the diſeaſe was introduced into Leinſol, a port on the ſouth ſide of Cyprus, where it ſpread. Larnica, a town forty miles diſtant, received part of the infected crew, which brot the contagion to Leinſol. A conſtant communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was held between the two cities; peaſants and mule drivers entered Larnica, with their peſtilential ſores upon them, and were daily in the ſtreets and markets. Some died in the houſes of the inhabitants. Other veſſels alſo arrived with infected crews from Egypt, ſome of whom died on landing. Yet mark the iſſue—all this contagion did not excite the plague in Larnica! But in the beginning of the next year, eight months after, the diſeaſe appeared in Larnica, without contagion, and made great havoc. See Ruſſel, page 4.</p>
                  <p>This fact and others compelled the author to admit that the diſeaſe is not always contagious, and that it does not become epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, without a certain ſtate of air. See pages 4, 5, 7, 17, 19, 307. Theſe facts are of infinite conſequence in directing the application of laws of quarantine; a ſubject to be hereafter diſcuſſed.</p>

Often it appears in ſporadic caſes, without exhibiting any contagion.</p>
                  <p>Pollinus relates an inſtance of a family, in which the father, mother, with two children and a ſervant died of the plague, without glandular ſwellings, and without ſpreading the diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that family.</p>
                  <p>Joubert informs us of an inſtance in 1574, of a reſpectable family, which loſt half of its members, by the plague, which ceaſed without ſpreading the infection. This was at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of a moſt peſtilential period.</p>
                  <p>Matthias Untzerus relates, that at Halle in Saxony, he was an eye-witneſs of inſtances, in which here and there a family had been ſeized with the plague, introduced from other places, without any ill effects in the reſt of the city—the diſeaſe termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in theſe families.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck obſerved ſimilar facts. In Oct. 1661, the daughter of a noble widow, was ſeized with a violent diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the plague, in the midſt of a town where no plague <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no foreign cauſe could be aſſigned for the diſeaſe. The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who attended her, died, and the infection extended to ſeven perſons, in ſucceſſion; the reſt ſaved themſelves by flight. Theſe perſons died, without the glandular tumors, and of courſe ſome of the attending phyſicians, denied the diſeaſe to be the plague. Diemerbroeck, on the contrary, judging from all the ſymptoms, pronounced it the plague. It happened that one of the maid-ſervants, who left the family and was going to her brother's at Amſterdam, was infected and ſeized with the plague, which ſoon put on the genuin marks of the diſeaſe, in an inguinal tumor and two anthraces. She recovered, but infected two of her broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's children, and there the diſeaſe diſappeared. No local cauſe could be aſſigned for the diſeaſe in that family. The plague was not before in the city or country, the houſe was a ſplendid, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant one and kept remarkably clean, remote from any filthy place, and had never been known to have an infected perſon in it. Hence our author concludes very juſtly that a peſtilent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:036687_0502_100AA4A2403AA3B8"/>
is not always epidemic, nor is an epidemic always danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor is peſtilence neceſſarily common to many people; but that the ſpreading of a diſeaſe by contagion, is wholly an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental circumſtance.</p>

                  <p>On this laſt fact, I will only obſerve, that the year it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, was 1661, the beginning of the conſtitution which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the augmented violence of the diſeaſes of London, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Sydenham, and the conſtitution which occaſioned the plague in Holland in 1663 and 4, and that in London in 1665.</p>
                  <p>It is to be regretted that thoſe able phyſicians and accurate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers had not extended their views of the ſubject to a preval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of that peſtilential conſtitution, in various countries, at one and the ſame time, inſtead of reſtricting their obſervations, each to his own country.</p>
                  <p>The author of the Traité de la peſte, who was a warm ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ier for the origin of the plague at Marſeilles in 1720 from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, and wrote a treatiſe to prove it, has however demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the contrary. He has admitted that the air of Marſeilles was peſtilential and produced diſeaſes marked with buboes and carbuncles, in the autumn preceding its ſuppoſed importation. But this is not all; he has recorded facts which confirm all that has been cited from Alpinus, Savary, Ruſſel and others, that the contagion of the plague will not ſpread the diſeaſe in an atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere not favorable to its propagation. He informs us, that the diſeaſe ſpread from Marſeilles, in ſpite of all precautions, and infected more than fifty villages of Provence. This was aſcribed to infected goods conveyed from Marſeilles. Yet the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provinces of Languedoc, Velais, Dauphiné and others, which he acknowledges to have been inundated with goods from the ſame city, eſcaped all infection. In Provence, the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per reached the inhabitants of mountains and was not even ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted by the rigors of winter; while in the adjoining territories, no perſon was affected, tho equally expoſed to infection. The author remarks further, that the diſeaſe paſſed over ſome villages, and infected others beyond them; for which no reaſon could be aſſigned, while all were alike expoſed.</p>

                  <p>Almoſt all the ſuppoſed inſtances of infection from merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, related in authors, when inveſtigated, are found to be mere ſuppoſitions and conjectures, raiſed and ſpread by vulgar credulity, without the leaſt foundation, and afterwards recorded as facts, by medical writers, who are infinitely leſs excuſable, than other people. I have inveſtigated many ſuch inſtances in America, where reports had become popular, and grown into ſuch credit, as to be generally believed and received as facts, and I have, in every caſe, found evidence amounting to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that thoſe reports were idle ſurmiſes, very often puerile in their origin, and utterly unſupported by facts. Some of the received opinions, in regard to the imported infection of plagues in Europe, when ſubjected to careful ſcrutiny, prove to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of foundation. Among theſe, are the opinions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and recorded by grave writers, relative to the London plague of 1665, and that at Marſeilles in 1720.</p>
                  <p>The ſuppoſition that the plague was conveyed from Marſeilles into fifty villages of Provence, by means of merchandize, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be no better founded. Setting aſide the errors of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tales, in which ſuch opinions uſually originate, it is utterly againſt all probability that goods ſold from ſhops and warehouſes ſhould contain infection. If they are ever infected, it muſt be by being uſed by the ſick; but the ſick do not uſe the goods in ſhops and ſtores; they are confined to their rooms; and rarely indeed are their bedding and clothes, ſent to market. Goods, the moſt ſuſceptible of infection, as woollen and cotton, may lie in ſtore during the plague, without any taint that can excite diſeaſe. In America we know this to be fact. In every town, where the fever has prevailed, ſhops and warehouſes filled with ſuch ſorts of goods, are open long after the diſeaſe has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and until the air of the ſtreets has become ſo peſtilential, as to excite the diſeaſe in a few hours in healthy ſtrangers; nay,

ſome of theſe ſhops are open, during the whole time, of the rage o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r worſt plagues; yet even cotton and woollen cloths have never, in any inſtance, contracted infection ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the diſeaſe afterwards to thoſe who handled or uſed them. I will venture to aver that all the reports in Europe about the propagation of the plague from town to town, and country to country, by merchandize, are the offspring of vulgar tales. It is poſſible that garments <hi>worn by the ſick</hi> and <hi>not cleanſed,</hi> may excite the diſeaſe in a ſound body; but ſuch garments, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the infection, muſt be cloſely packed in bales, cheſts or boxes, or the action of the air will deſtroy the infection, in a few days. And whenever an inſtance of this kind happens, the diſeaſe will die with the patient firſt infected; it will rarely or never ſpread, unleſs the conſtitution of air is ſo peſtilential, as to produce the diſeaſe without infection.</p>
                  <p>In theſe poſitions, I am warranted by a multitude of facts related of European plagues, and many that have occurred in America.</p>
                  <p>Hence, goods tranſported from Marſeilles, during the plague, did <hi>not</hi> communicate the diſeaſe in Languedoc, Velais or Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné. The true reaſon of the facts related by Chicoyneau, is, that the air of the whole country about Marſeilles was peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and affected moſt of the villages in Provence, altho ſome eſcaped. Further removed from the ſea ſhore, in the contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous provinces, the air was leſs peſtilential, and the diſeaſe did not appear. Goods were conveyed to all theſe provinces indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately; but they had no concern in the propagation of the plague. The plague appeared, where the peſtilential principle was competent to produce it, the ſeat of which was at Marſeilles, a large populous city; but which extended, as it always does, to ſome diſtance, beyond which it produced no plague. Wherever the diſtemper appeared, vulgar ignorance aſcribed it to goods; and where it did not appear, after the reception of goods from Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles, the vulgar and the learned all agree they could not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it; they wondered that goods would not infect people in Languedoc, as well as in Provence—and all the writers on the ſubject in Europe, from that time to this, ſeemed to have been ſatisfied with wondering at the phenomenon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="unknown:036687_0505_100AA4A9047A7C00"/>Of the truth of the doctrin, that the plague will not ſpread from infection, in an atmoſphere not proper for it, we have in America moſt indubitable evidences.</p>
                  <p>In every peſtilence that has affected our cities for ſix years paſt, great numbers of perſons, when ill, have been removed into the country, or have been ſeized after removal, but not one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance occurred of the ſpreading of the diſeaſe in the country to any extent, from ſuch infected perſons until the year 1798. There have been a few ſcattering inſtances, in which the nurſes of ſuch perſons have received the diſorder. Theſe have been very rare; probably not in one inſtance of a hundred, has any perſon been affected by fomites from ſuch diſeaſed perſons. Moſt violent caſes of the peſtilence, when removed into a pure air, exhibit no infection that is perceptible. This fact correſponds with what has been related of the importation of infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and goods into Egypt in June, July and Auguſt, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces no ill effect; but for a very good reaſon; the air of that country, during the inundation of the Nile, will not <hi>generate</hi> the plague; and hence the vulgar idea, that it is not imported, or will not ſpread from infection.</p>
                  <p>But not only do our country people eſcape infection, from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed citizens who ſicken and die in their houſes, but our cities alſo, when the conſtitution of air does not favor the diſeaſe, are not affected by the introduction of the worſt caſes from neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring cities. Thus in 1793, many perſons from Philadelphia, entered New-York, in ſpite of precautions, taken by the police, ſickened and died in boarding houſes and other places, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out communicating the diſeaſe in a ſingle inſtance. In 1795, the caſe was reverſed; New-York generated a contagious fever, but Philadelphia did not; and ſeveral perſons, who left New-York, ſickened and died in Philadelphia without infecting any perſon whatever.</p>
                  <p>It is unneceſſary to multiply examples; the ſame has happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between Philadelphia and Baltimore; between Norfolk and the adjacent country; between Boſton and Providence; in ſhort there is not an exception to the remark, that infected perſons, carried into towns and cities where the atmoſphere has not been

In every caſe, and the inſtances have been very numerous, the diſeaſe has diſappeared with the recovery or death of the firſt or ſecond patient.<note n="*" place="bottom">In 1798 the firſt caſes of the fever in Cheſter and Wilmington origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from Philadelphia; but the atmoſphere alſo of the country in New-Jerſey and Delaware actually <hi>generated</hi> the diſeaſe, in the neighboring diſtricts, and ſo it did in Connecticut.</note>

                  <p>But this is not all. In the ſame town or city, where the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence has been general in a particular quarter, another part of the town or city, ſituated on better ventilated or more elevated land, has not only been free from the epidemic, but has poſſeſſed an air capable of reſiſting the infection of the diſeaſed. This, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree, was the fact in Philadelphia, where no part of the city can be called <hi>elevated;</hi> yet in 1793 and 1797, few caſes of the fever occurred in the weſtern part of the city. But in New-York, New-Haven, Providence, New-London, Boſton, and Newburyport, the diſeaſe has had its peſtilential region, or quarter of the town, in which it became epidemic and infectious; but other parts of the town have been free from it. And in all ſuch inſtances the moſt malignant caſes, in perſons ſeized in the peſtilential region, and conveyed to the healthy part of the town, have exhibited no infection; or if a ſingle nurſe has taken the diſeaſe, of which I have heard of two or three inſtances, the infection has there ceaſed and produced no further effects.</p>
                  <p>Theſe exempted parts of the towns are the more cleanly and airy ſituations. To this however occur two exceptions. One in Philadelphia, in 1798, the diſeaſe of which year was more virulent and more infectious, than in former years, and extended to healthy poſitions. The other exception is in New-London, the laſt ſummer alſo; in which town, the diſeaſe had indeed its peſtilential region, marked diſtinctly, as before related; but this part of the town, where the diſeaſe raged, is as airy and well built, as any other quarter.</p>
                  <p>Evagrius remarked of the plague in his time, that it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attacked certain parts of cities, and left others untouched. See the year 590.</p>
                  <p>Peſtilential diſeaſes then have an atmoſphere in which they
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:036687_0507_100AA4ACA0262210"/>
rage with violence; but at a diſtance, they loſe the power of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting, at leaſt to a great degree. Van Swieten remarks this of the ſpotted fever in 1756—if healthy perſons deſcended into the valleys where it was prevalent, they took the diſeaſe; but when removed into more airy ſituations, they infected no one.</p>
                  <bibl>Vol. 16. 59.</bibl>
                  <p>Theſe facts all concur to eſtabliſh the principle, that ſome oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cauſe muſt act with infection, to render this peſtilence epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic, or to give it effect. The conſequence is unavoidable, that the infecting cauſe, is <hi>not</hi> a <hi>ſpecific contagion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, the infecting power of the plague and other autumnal diſeaſes, is ſuſceptible of gradation, from the loweſt point of danger, up to the higheſt; a circumſtance that does not characterize the ſpecific contagion of ſmall-pox and meaſles. In America, we have ſeen the diſeaſe in every ſtage of virulence, except perhaps the very higheſt, like that in the days of Gallus and Voluſian, that in the time of Evagrius, or that in the reign of Edward III, and a few others. The diſeaſe in Philadelphia in 1797 was more infectious than that in 1793, and that in 1798 ſtill more than either. The fever in New-York in 1795 exhibited very little infection, not one caſe in twenty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from any communication with the ſick; but in 1798, the diſeaſe put on a more virulent aſpect, and was more generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious. In Baltimore, the diſeaſe in 1797 ran through all the grades of bilious fever, from an ordinary remittent, which for weeks prevailed without infection, to a contagious yellow fever.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all. During the ſame ſeaſon, and in the ſame city, the diſeaſe exiſts in all its grades from an intermittent to the contagious yellow fever. It is a very frequent thing for perſons ſeized with decided ſymptoms of the peſtilential fever, to have the diſeaſe reduced by early applications, to a remittent or an intermittent. Of this I am an inſtance myſelf; having contracted the malignant fever in New-York in Auguſt 1798, from the air of the city, for I was near no diſeaſed perſons, and returned home, I was ſeized with the ſymptoms, tho not of the moſt violent kind. The fever was diſturbed by early remedies, and I became convaleſcent; but in a few days, I relapſed and
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:036687_0508_100AA4AF5009F8E8"/>
the fever took the form of a regular tertian. Dr. Ruſh relates ſimilar examples in the fever of 1793.</p>
                  <p>Lind, on diſeaſes of hot climates, p. 179, remarks, that patients, with a mild intermittent, ſent to Greenwich hoſpital, near a marſh, in Jamaica, ſoon grew worſe, and their diſeaſe turned to a malignant yellow fever or mortal dyſentery.</p>
                  <p>A multitude of ſuch facts have been obſerved in America, which, with the remarkable hiſtory of the diſeaſe in Baltimore in 1797, ſeem to amount to a demonſtration, that the plague and all autumnal bilious diſorders, are of one ſpecies, differing only in their grades. Indeed the writers on the Levant plague, while they utterly deny ſuch a ſameneſs in kind between that diſeaſe and any other, have recorded facts to prove the doctrin here maintained.</p>
                  <p>P. Ruſſel admits that the plague in Aleppo was of very vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous degrees of malignity, and was not always infectious. He has even arranged the caſes in ſeveral diſtinct claſſes, according to the various ſymptoms and degrees of mortality.</p>
                  <p>Lady W. Montague, in letter 31, has the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. "Thoſe dreadful ſtories you have heard of the plague, have very little foundation in truth. I own I have much ado to reconcile myſelf to the ſound of a word which has always given me ſuch terrible ideas; tho I am convinced there is little more in it than in a fever." She then proceeds to relate, how ſhe paſſed through ſeveral infected towns, that her cook was taken ill, and ſhe was told, with a great cold—that ſhe left her doctor to attend him, but the cook ſoon recovered, and both cook and doctor in a few days, arrived in health at Adrianople. She was then ſurpriſed to learn, that her cook had been ill with the plague. She concludes, from her own experience, that the air is never infected and that it is as eaſy to root the plague out of Turkey, as out of Italy and France.<note n="*" place="bottom">Notwithſtanding this diſeaſe was "rooted out of France," it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that, in two years after Lady Montague wrote her letter, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles was almoſt depopulated by the diſeaſe!</note> She remarks alſo that "many eſcape it"—which is certainly wonderful!</p>
                  <p>Juſt ſo careleſsly people reaſon and draw concluſions, from a
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:036687_0509_100AA4B1752B1968"/>
ſingle curſory obſervation, or an iſolated fact; a practice among travellers, as among men of pretended ſcience, which is the ſource of numberleſs errors. It is undoubtedly true, that the plague is often "little more than a fever;" but if Lady Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague had been in Cairo in 1580, or in 1736, or in Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople in 543, or in 1751, or in London in 1665, or in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles in 1720, ſhe would have thought the plague ſomething more than an ordinary fever. The truth is, the diſeaſe exhibits dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent grades of violence, at different times.</p>
                  <p>Savary remarks, that ſuch as <hi>catch</hi> the plague in Egypt in June, July and Auguſt are always cured.</p>
                  <p>So obſerves Mignot, in his hiſtory of the Turkiſh empire, vol. 2. p. 4, "the plague at certain times, is incurable; at oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, eaſy to be cured. The contagion is more or leſs ſtrong, according to the ſtate of the air."</p>
                  <p>Similar remarks occcur in the Traité de la peſte. The author is full of his idea of contagion, but he ſays, the plague, tho al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from one cauſe, appears differently in different places, and a ſmall diſtance between them makes it appear like two different diſeaſes, as at Montpelier and at Lyons.</p>
                  <p>Chandler, in his travels, gives us wonderful diſcoveries on this ſubject. He ſays, the diſeaſe proceeds from certain inviſible animalcules, burrowing and forming their neſt in the human body. Theſe are imported annually into Smyrna—they are leaſt fatal at the beginning, and latter end of the ſeaſon. If they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive early in the ſpring, they are weak, but gather ſtrength, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply and then periſh!!</p>
                  <p>Such ſilly opinions are gravely recorded in books, yet they prove that infection is of very different degrees of ſtrength, or that it is the ſtate of the air, and not infection, which produces the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>P. Alpinus, followed by Volney, Savary and others, ſpeaks of this difference in the malignity of the plague; but he aſcribes it to the <hi>place</hi> where the diſeaſe originates. He ſays, the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from Barbary is more putrid and virulent, than from Greece and Syria, and inſtances that of 1580.</p>
                  <bibl>Vol. 3. p. 61 and 2.</bibl>

                     <pb n="155" facs="unknown:036687_0510_100AA4B3C5A37370"/>It is true that ſome of the moſt violent plagues have firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Ethiopia or Barbary, as in the time of Thucydides, in 252, in 1580, in 1736; but theſe writers ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected that others equally violent have originated in Egypt, in China, in Italy and in Conſtantinople. Witneſs that in 542 which began near Peluſium in Lower Egypt, thoſe of 1347 and of 1450 which began in China or other parts of Aſia, and that of 745 which commenced in Calabria, in the kingdom of Naples. They might have obſerved alſo, that many plagues, of the moſt deſtructive kind, have appeared at once in twenty or more of the cities of Europe. Theſe conſiderations would have detected the puerilty of the notion, that contagion from one country is more "putrid and virulent" than from another, and led the obſervers of nature to the true cauſe of theſe different grades of malignan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, different ſtates of the atmoſphere in different periods.</p>
                  <p>Fernelius divides epidemics into three kinds: An epidemy from exhalations or vapor from the earth; from great changes of ſeaſons; and from an occult, malignant quality in the air; the laſt, he maintains, is the only true cauſe of the peſtis; the others are preparatory to it; but theſe cauſes often unite, and the plague then becomes moſt ſevere. Putrid exhalations do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone produce the plague, but prepare for it and aid its progreſs. Hence it does not affect all places or all men alike—but is moſt ſevere in maritime places; in thoſe expoſed to the ſouth; warm and humid, abounding with impure exhalations.</p>
                  <bibl>De Morb. Peſt. 189.</bibl>
                  <p>There is a great deal of truth in theſe obſervations, and I cannot but remark how much more correct theſe authors are who often ſaw the plague, than Mead and others who had no ſuch advantages.</p>
                  <p>The violence of the peſtilential principle, aided by ſeaſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably debilitating, has ſometimes diſpatched the human race, with terrible rapidity. The more uſual courſe of the plague is from five to ſeven days, when death or a favorable criſis takes place. But to this there have been ſome diſmal exceptions. The diſeaſe deſcribed by Evagrius in 590, generally put an end to life in three days. This alſo was the period of the criſis in
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:036687_0511_100AA4B54D57C968"/>
the dreadful plague, in the days of Vortigern, in 448, and the ſubſequent years. In the ſimilar calamity of 1348, few patients lived beyond the third day.</p>
                  <p>In many inſtances, during theſe more general plagues, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have died ſuddenly, as in an apoplexy; as in the peſtilence at Narbonne in 1534, where men frequently fell dead as they were walking or converſing; of which Skenkius himſelf was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an eye-witneſs. He cites as authorities for the ſame fact, Valleriola, Gemma, Salius and Cardanus. See page 765. The ſame happened in the peſtilence deſcribed by Evagrius; and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors relate that no leſs than eighty perſons, fell dead in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion inſtituted by St. Gregory, about the year 590.<note n="*" place="bottom">This diſeaſe ſometimes attacks in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>rm of an apoplexy; in other caſes, perſons are indiſpoſed, for ſome days, but able to walk, while the diſeaſe is ſecretly undermining the animal powers. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuddenly paſs from apparent health to their graves.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dion Caſſius mentions an expedition of a Roman army into Arabia Felix; in which moſt of the ſoldiers periſhed by unuſual diſtempers. Many of them were ſeized in the head; the brain diſſolved, and the diſeaſe falling upon the throat, ſuffocation ſpeedily ended life. This was evidently the effect of extreme heat, producing exceſſive excitement and ſoon followed by a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal debility of the nervous ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>Terrible indeed muſt be that virulence of the peſtilential prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which bids defiance to cold. Yet ſuch has been the caſe in a number of plagues. In the peſtilence of 543, ſays Proco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius, the diſeaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> invaded ſome places in ſummer; others in win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Evagrius makes the ſame remark of the plague in 590. The black peſtilence of 1348 attacked countries, in northern lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itudes, in winter or ſummer, without diſcrimination. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in Provence in 1720, was not controlled by the rigors of winter. The peſtilence in 1591, raged thro a cold wint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> in Revel and Narva, in the 59th degree of north latitude. "Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, ſays Fernelius, the moſt intolerable heat of ſummer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces no peſtilential diſorder, at othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in autumn." p. 189.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck remarks that a plague which begins in winter or autumn, is more violent and of longer duration, than one which
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:036687_0512_100AA4B81B987FB8"/>
begins in other ſeaſons. So ſays Peter Paſchal, an author cited by Diemerbroeck; the plague which begins in ſpring or ſummer ends in winter; that which begins in autumn or winter, is of longer continuance.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this diverſity is very obvious. The peſtilence which appears in winter, in northern latitudes, can proceed only from a diſpoſition of the atmoſphere; for cold totally deſtroys all infection of that diſeaſe, and all the influence of putrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations. Whenever therefore the plague invades man in cold weather, it demonſtrates a <hi>more malignant</hi> ſtate of the air, and one that is not controlled by cold weather or froſt. Such a ſtate of the air muſt of courſe produce more fatal effects, than an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior force in the peſtilential principle, which perhaps requires the aid of heat, humidity and noxious exhalations to produce a very violent plague. Thanks to heaven, moſt of the peſtilences that afflict mankind are of this latter, or ſubordinate degree; in which the real plague is limited to places highly charged with morbid ſubſtances, which it is in the power of man to diſſipate or remove. A vaſt proportion of all peſtilential diſeaſes are found to rage only in cities, jails, camps, and crowded ſhips, and may be avoided or mitigated by human means.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, hiſtorical facts warrant me in believing, that the peſtilential principle does, at times, acquire a virulence, that proves fatal to life, in every ſeaſon and every ſituation; aſſailing indiſcriminately the city and the cottage; the cleanly dwellings of the rich and the filthy cells of the poor; the higheſt hills, as well as the valleys, the borders of moraſſes, and the nauſeous alleys of a populous town. During this melancholy ſtate of the elements of life, and ſuch was their condition during the rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the black peſtilence in the reign of Edward III. men are however not to deſpair of preſerving life; but the means conſiſt in applications to the human body, calculated to guard, not againſt infection ſo much, as againſt <hi>debility,</hi> the deciding proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe of the malady.</p>
                  <p>Hiſtorians mention a remarkable difference in the operation of the two very furious plagues, in 1348 and 1361. That of 1348 was moſt fatal to the poor; but that of 1361 was moſt mortal among the nobility and gentry, and on hills and mountains, which
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:036687_0513_100AA4BA234E2988"/>
uſually eſcape. In the firſt caſe then, morbid exhalations conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted an influential cauſe in producing the malady—in the latter caſe, they operated as a ſhield or antiſceptic—and the facts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the various force of the elemental cauſes.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, to give effect to the infection of the plague, and at times, to other autumnal diſeaſes, there muſt be an apt or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> diſpoſition in the human body. This is admitted by Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates, who obſerves that body differs from body, the nature of one man, from that of another, the nutriment of one, from that of another, and the ſame things are not alike pernicious to one ſpecies of animals, as to another. Hence he accounts for diſeaſes invading one kind of animals at one time, another ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies at a different time, and different ſpecies having their various diſtempers.</p>
                  <bibl>Lib. de flatibus.</bibl>
                  <p>Thus Galen remarks, that the ſame cauſes do not affect all perſons alike; if they did, violent heat, exceſſive fatigue or drinking or anger, or grief, would produce fever in every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and for the ſame reaſon, all perſons alike would be ſeized with peſtilence, during the reign of the dog-ſtar.</p>
                  <bibl>De dif. ſeb. cap. 4.</bibl>
                  <p>In conformity to theſe ideas, Diemerbroeck, p. 50, lays it down as a principle, that no perſon will receive infection, unleſs his body has an <hi>aptitudinem,</hi> a fitneſs, or diſpoſition to receive it, ariſing from ſome ſecret quality or bad ſtate of the ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>On this point, we reaſon without knowing cauſes; all we can do is to collect and arrange facts, which decide in favor of this hypotheſis. We are compelled to admit the principle, not only as it reſpects the operation of infection, but alſo of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental or primary atmoſpheric cauſe of peſtilence, which makes an evident diſtinction, at times, between perſons of different habits, families, and nations.<note n="*" place="bottom">Medical men are not agreed, as to the nature of what is called <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition.</hi> Brown, in Elements of Medicin, defines it to be a leſs degree of the diſeaſe; that is, the commencement of the diſeaſe. I ſuſpect this definition, properly limited, to be nearly juſt. It is probable that all fevers are the effects of debility, and that when this debility com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mences, a perſon may be ſaid to be <hi>prediſpoſed to diſeaſe;</hi> altho the diſeaſe may not be formed in many days or weeks after, or may be prevented by early applications.</note>

                     <pb n="159" facs="unknown:036687_0514_100AA4BBC7CA2400"/>Theſe facts came under the obſervation of Procopius and Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius. In 543, ſays the former, no phyſician or attendant caught the diſtemper—while many were ſeized they knew not from what cauſe and ſuddenly died. Many, ſays Evagrius, who fled from infected places, remained ſafe themſelves, while they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the diſeaſe to others. Many who remained with the ſick and freely handled them, wholly eſcaped. Others, in deſpair for the loſs of friends, threw themſelves in the way of infection, but were not able to contract the diſeaſe; while others received the diſeaſe by the ſlighteſt connection with infected houſes, or in open market.</p>
                  <p>We have many memorable examples of a ſimilar nature in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica —they are too numerous to be ſpecified. I ſuſpect how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that four fifths of ſuch caſes are improperly aſcribed to infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck relates that in the height of the plague at Nimeguen, the air was ſo bad, that all places were nearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as to the danger of infection; perſons received the diſeaſe with or without intercourſe with the ſick.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the plague diſcriminates between natives of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent countries. The French fugitives from the Weſt-Indies, who have reſided in our cities during peſtilence have generally eſcaped. This is not however very remarkable; as they are accuſtomed to a climate which is, like our ſummers, peculiarly fitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſimilar diſeaſe; at the ſame time, their manner of living is better ſuited to the warm ſeaſon, than that of our own citizens.</p>
                  <p>But a ſimilar diſcrimination has been often obſerved, among natives of the ſame latitudes, or nearly the ſame. Thus Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, lib. 8, relates that in a peſtilence at Baſle, the Swiſs only were affected; the French, Italians and Germans eſcaped. John Utenhovius relates that in a plague in Denmark, all ſtrangers, as Engliſh, Germans and Hollanders eſcaped, altho they reſided in families and aſſociated freely with the infected. The Sudor Anglicus, when it firſt appeared in England, attacked none but the Engliſh; but in ſubſequent peſtilential conſtitutions, it inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded almoſt all Europe.</p>
                  <p>We have in America moſt illuſtrious examples of the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above mentioned. In the ſweeping peſtilence of 1618, when
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:036687_0515_100AA4BD5A77CD78"/>
almoſt all the Indians periſhed, on a tract of three hundred miles in extent, ſome white men wintered in the country and aſſociated freely with the ſick, without injury. In a ſimilar peſtilence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Indians on Nantucket, in 1763, not a white man was affected, tho never ſo much expoſed to infection. Two or three other inſtances have come to my knowledge. A like diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation took place in Egypt in the time of Moſes.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the plague ſingles out particular families. Thus Diemerbroeck obſerved in the plague at Nimeguen, whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, by a ſecret ſympathy, were ſeized all at one time; and in ſome inſtances, where the members of the ſame family lived, at a diſtance from each other, in different parts of the city, they were all attacked nearly at the ſame time. What is more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the ſame fact was repeatedly obſerved, where the members of the ſame family lived in different towns. Of this there were many exemples. One man by the name of Van Dans, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his children from infection, ſent two of them to Gorcum in Holland, to reſide with his friends, and kept the third at home. There was no peſtilential diſeaſe in Gorcum, at that time, and the two children remained in health for two or three months; but at laſt both were ſeized with the plague and died, at the ſame time that the father and another child died with it in Nimeguen. The mother was ſeized, but recovered. About the ſame time, a ſiſter, and two or three other children, reſiding with another ſiſter, at a diſtance, and ſeveral more remote relations of the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, all periſhed with the ſame diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>So it is related by Evagrius, who was ſurpriſed at the fact, that particular families, ſometimes only one or two, were arreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the plague, while all the other inhabitants of the city re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in health. But he remarks further, that thoſe who eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, the firſt year, experienced the like calamity in the next. This fact, by the way, is common, and ſhould have led Evagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us and others to obſerve the progreſſiveneſs of the peſtilential cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Pliny, lib. 7. ca. 50, remarks that old people are uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from attacks of the plague; but that all nations are ſubject to peſtilential diſeaſes, which invade them by kinds or claſſes,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:036687_0516_100AA4C11F50C110"/>
ſometimes falling on ſervants, ſometimes on nobles, and on oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by grades or ranks. Nature, ſays this author, has even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed certain laws to diſeaſes. The laſt remark ſhould have excited the minds of phyſicians to diſcover theſe laws. Such laws certainly exiſt, and epidemics of all kinds are connected in principle.</p>
                  <p>I have met with other inſtances of diſcrimination, perhaps more remarkable. One is related from John Helwigius, in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netus' Collection of Northern Medicine, page 228. In 1621, when the ſmall-pox raged with great mortality, it was remarked that perſons of the ſame blood, as brothers, couſins and other relatives, living at a great diſtance from each other, and as far as from Nuremberg to Lyons in France, were ſeized with the diſeaſe at one and the ſame time. I draw no important conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from this fact, becauſe this diſeaſe is not <hi>limited</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular families, altho it may ſeize one family before it does another.</p>
                  <p>Another inſtance is related by Van Swieten, Vol. 16, from Heiſter, an author of undoubted credit. At Altdorf, in Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia, broke out in 1711, a malignant fever, approaching to the plague in violence, but not with the glandular tumors. This diſeaſe attacked none, but the ſtudents or others of the univerſity; but it ſeized them wherever they were diſperſed in private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, in all parts of the town. It ſeized the profeſſors alſo and their families, but went no farther by infection. It attacked alſo the printer to the univerſity and his workmen, tho at a diſtance from the college; while another printer, contiguous to the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, eſcaped. Students alſo belonging to the univerſity, tho at home, as at Nuremburg, were ſeized. It was thus reſtricted in its attacks, and exhibited no infection, beyond theſe deſcriptions of perſons.</p>
                  <p>It muſt not be omitted, that this was a very ſickly period in all the north of Europe. In this ſame year, the plague raged in Copenhagen, and it had in the preceding years, ſpread over Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and along the Baltic.</p>
                  <p>This fact at Altdorf is by far the moſt ſingular, that I have found in hiſtory; but that a violent diſeaſe ſhould attack perſons of one blood, and not of another, is leſs ſurprizing. We have
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:036687_0517_100AA4C329E87078"/>
recent proofs of this diſcrimination in America. In 1796, three perſons of one name in Hartford, two brothers and a couſin, were ſuddenly ſeized with a violent fever, of a putrid tendency, tho in winter, and carried off within a few days of each other. At the ſame time, two or three others of the family were ſeized leſs violently in the ſame town and recovered; and what is more ſingular, two other brothers, one in Litchfield, 30 miles from Hartford, and another in New-York, 130 miles diſtant, were attacked nearly at the ſame time, and were very ill, but ſurvived. No infection could have exiſted in moſt of theſe caſes, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons did not ſee each other.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>A curious fact is related to me by Dr. Dutton of Oxford, in Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. In the year 1795, almoſt every <hi>male</hi> child, born in the beginning of the year, in that and the adjacent towns, died within a fortnight by convulſions, but <hi>no female</hi> child was affected. This was obſerved to be more frequent in families that had been affected by the ſcarlatina, in the preceding year.</p>
                        <p>It will be remarked that this was near the diſtrict of country which had ſuffered by a peſtilential fever and dyſentery.</p>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another inſtance occurred in Cambridge, Maſſachuſetts, and is ſtated to me by the attending phyſician.</p>
                  <p>In October 1791, a young woman, belonging to a family in that town, but who had, for two years, lived at a diſtance of three miles from her father's houſe, was ſeized with a putrid bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious fever. Her mother repaired to the place and nurſed her, till ſhe was convaleſcent. None of the family viſited her while ſick, except the father occaſionally, and her eldeſt ſiſter. The latter took the place of the mother, for a few days, who was called home to attend two other children who were ſeized with the ſame diſeaſe, and who had never been expoſed to infection. Before theſe recovered, three others were taken with the fever in the ſame family. The three laſt had doubtleſs aſſiſted in nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſick or been into their rooms, and therefore might have been infected.</p>
                  <p>In April following, another of the children, who had lived at a diſtance from the family and had not been permitted to ſee any of the ſick, was ſeized with the ſame fever, at the houſe where ſhe lived. In the ſame month, the father and another child, were taken with it at home. Not one of the family, at
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:036687_0518_100AA4C55039FDE0"/>
home or abroad, eſcaped, except the mother, who had nurſed all the ſick, except one, and was moſt expoſed to infection. The diſeaſed were very offenſive, but all recovered, except one; and neither my informant, the attending phyſician, nor any nurſe or viſitor, out of the family, was in the leaſt injured by infection.</p>
                  <bibl>M. S. letter from Dr. Wm. Gamage.</bibl>
                  <p>This diſeaſe was a family peſtilence, which began in autumn, was ſuſpended by the cold of winter, and revived in ſpring. It reſembles, on a ſmall ſcale, the great plagues in London and Marſeilles, and many others, in which a few caſes occurred, in the preceding autumn, clearly marking a peſtilential ſtate of air, in that particular city, which ſtate was arreſted in its operation by cold in winter, but again exhibited its effects in ſpring.</p>
                  <p>The limitation of the diſeaſe to a particular family, of the ſame blood, or diſpoſition to be affected by a certain morbid ſtate of air, is a myſterious phenomenon, but the fact is ſo well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained, as to leave no room to queſtion its exiſtence. We can aſcribe it only to a general ſtate of air, fitted to produce injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or fatal effects on bodies of a particular temperament, which temperament or diſpoſition conſiſts in the inviſible ſtructure or organization. It is demonſtrated that infection cannot be the only cauſe of the diſeaſes in theſe families; and of courſe we are compelled to admit the exiſtence of another cauſe, which can only be the atmoſphere, for no other cauſe extends its operation to the diſtance at which the effects were produced.</p>
                  <p>It is on this principle alone that particular perſons or families eſcape the worſt plagues that have afflicted mankind, as related by Evagrius, and all authors on the ſubject, and of which we have numerous inſtances in America. But,</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Why drew Marſeilles' good biſhop purer breath,</l>
                     <l>When nature ſickened and each gale was death?"</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>is the interrogatory of an inimitable poet, which has never been anſwered; for on this ſubject, as on every other, we are baffled and confounded, when we attempt to reach primary natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The interior organization of animals and vegetables, is far beyond the limits of human inveſtigation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="unknown:036687_0519_100AA4C7C41F8EA8"/>Lord Veruclam has left a paſſage confirmatory of the foregoing principles. "The plague, ſays this great obſerver of facts, is not eaſily received by thoſe that continually attend the ſick, as phyſicians; nor again by old people, and ſuch as are of a dry, cold complexion. On the other hand, the plague ſooneſt ſeizes thoſe that come out of freſh air, thoſe that are faſting and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. It is alſo noted to go in a blood, more than from ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to ſtranger."</p>
                  <bibl>Works, Vol. 3.</bibl>
                  <p>It is in analogy with the foregoing facts, that animals of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpecies are affected with epidemic diſeaſes, which bear a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude in their predominant ſymptoms, at different ſtages of a peſtilential conſtitution of air. Sometimes, horſes, cattle and ſheep feel the operation of the deſtructive principle, at the ſame time with man. At other times, this principle will affect cattle a year before it reaches mankind. Sometimes, it firſt aſſails the human race, and afterwards the irrational parts of creation. In ſome years one ſpecies of animals is affected; the next year, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Thus horſes experienced the epidemic of 1793, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, in the winter following the plague in that city. The cats periſhed in 1797. The fiſh in James' river died in 1797, the oyſters on the ſhores of Connecticut ſickened in 1794, and the fowls in Connecticut in 1796.</p>
                  <p>Not unfrequently, the force of the peſtilential principle, in one country, ſeems to expend itſelf principally on the brute creation; while, in the ſame year, or ſucceſſion of years, its principal ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in a neighboring country, is experienced by mankind. Thus in 1712 and 13, a very peſtilential period, the cattle in Italy, Germany and other places received the full force of the peſtilence, in a deſolating epidemic, while in Auſtria, Hungary and the eaſt, the peſtilence fell on men. Thus alſo in 1770, while a dreadful plague was raging in Turkey and Poland, a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſtemper ſwept away the cattle in Holland, Flanders and ſome parts of England, and malignant fevers prevailed in ſome parts of America.</p>
                  <p>That the great general cauſe of the diſeaſes, among the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpecies of animals, is the ſame, is obvious from this conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, that during the ſame conſtitution of air, or peſtilential
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:036687_0520_100AA4CA6F05FAA8"/>
period, the diſeaſes of man and beaſt have a number of ſimilar ſymptoms; ſuch was the fact in Auſtria, Italy and Germany in 1712 and 13; and ſuch has been the caſe in the United States.</p>
                  <p>In conformity with the general principle above mentioned, we obſerve that however analogous may be the ſymptoms of diſeaſes in man and beaſt, the diſtempers of one rarely infect the other. Infection is limited uſually to that ſpecies of animals, which have an aptneſs to receive the operation of the primary atmoſpheric cauſe of the diſeaſe. Thus diſeaſed horſes do not infect men, nor diſeaſed men, horſes. So when a plague attacks the natives of a particular country only, the infection, like the primary cauſe of the diſeaſe, is reſtricted in its operation to thoſe particular peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But this is rarely or never the caſe with the ſpecific conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the ſmall-pox and meaſles, in regard to mankind.</p>
                  <p>Authors indeed relate that hogs, dogs and poultry, feeding on highly infected articles, or wallowing in the filth thrown from houſes, during the plague, have died with a ſimilar diſeaſe. A few inſtances are mentioned by Diemerbroeck, Boccace and others. Hodges mentions a diſeaſe taken from a horſe, which ceaſed without becoming epidemic.</p>
                  <p>But theſe iſolated facts form no exception to the general rule; for ſuch diſtempers never ſpread and become epidemic. They only prove my general doctrin, that the contagious quality of plague, is not a ſpecific principle, but a quality capable of every poſſible degree of force—that in its lower or more attenuated forms, it affects few or no perſons whatever; but it <hi>may</hi> be ſo concentrated or condenſed, as to deſtroy life, not only in bodies of an aptitude to receive the poiſon, but alſo in other ſpecies of animals, which have no ſuch aptitude. Hence, the poiſon gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated in the clothes of the ſick, when put into cheſts or pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, uncleanſed, in hot weather, may be ſo concentrated or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by fermentation, as to kill almoſt inſtantly, the perſon who opens them. But an infectious diſeaſe thus produced, will never ſpread far, without the aid of a ſtate of air which is peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential. On the other hand, from thouſands of inſtances in books, and within the knowledge of Americans, who are annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, monthly and weekly receiving infection from the Weſt-Indies,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:036687_0521_100AA4CBF5A5FA70"/>
we know that the infection ſoon diſappears in a healthy conſtitution of air. It may be ſo virulent as to give diſeaſe to the perſons who firſt approach it; but in theſe the diſeaſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould be further remarked, as a uſeful hint, that perſons removing ſuddenly from freſh ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to an infected place, are doubly expoſed. The increaſe of the peſtilential cauſes is uſually grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual; therefore perſons who live within their operation, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly fitted, by the flexible texture of the ſyſtem, to ſuſtain their effects. But ſudden changes are very dangerous. The body will hardly ever ſuſtain great changes in the powers of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement, when ſuddenly made. Hence the extreme danger of removing from freſh to infected air; and ſometimes, of removing from infected to freſh air. The ſudden alteration in the ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us operating on the ſyſtem, may be as fatal in one caſe as the other.</p>
                  <p>Another diſtinguiſhing circumſtance, in peſtilential diſeaſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd one that deciſively marks different grades of violence in the cauſes, is, the manner in which the diſeaſe invades neighboring cities. It is always obſerved, that during the prevalence of the plague, it attacks cities or towns at ſome diſtance, in one year, leaving other towns in the intervals between them, untouched; the next year perhaps, or the ſecond year after, it invades thoſe intermediate towns which had eſcaped. This is always the fact, and it has puzzled all authors who have related it; yet the fact has never been accounted for, as its cauſes have never been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. Mead, who was not perſonally acquainted with this diſeaſe and whoſe theory led him to explain all its phenomena by contagion, was greatly embarraſſed with this fact. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the eſcape of Vicenza, in Italy, 1575, when Verona and Padua, one on each ſide of Vicenza, were ſeverely afflicted; and in the next year, Vicenza was deſolated, when Verona and Padua were exempt. He could not explain how the infection, which came from Trent, where the diſeaſe firſt appeared, ſhould <hi>paſs over Vicenza</hi> and reach a more diſtant city.</p>
                  <p>Erroneous theories are the ſource of innumerable miſchiefs in ſcience. The fact is a common one, and on a juſt view of the cauſes of peſtilence, is very eaſily explained. And what is
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:036687_0522_100AA4CD80ADB8A8"/>
ſurprizing, Procopius and Evagrius have recorded facts which afford a clue to the ſecret, altho medical writers, from their days to the preſent time, have ſuffered them to paſs without no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Procopius mentions that the peſtilence which began in 542, ſpread over the earth, but "if it paſſed by a particular country at firſt, or <hi>ſlightly affected it,</hi> it ſoon returned upon it with the ſame deſolating rage, which other places had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced." Evagrius alſo remarks, that "ſome places were more ſlightly affected;" and in another paſſage he ſays, that in ſome cities a few families were ſeized the firſt year, and the reſt of the city, the year following.</p>
                  <p>Here we have a clue to the myſtery. The plague ſeizes firſt the cities and towns where the <hi>general,</hi> or <hi>local cauſes</hi> are the moſt powerful. Thus, the plague of 1575, which puzzled Mead ſo much, commenced in Trent on the Adige, which, all geographers agree, is a moſt unhealthy place. It next attacked Verona and Padua for a ſimilar reaſon, and afterwards Vicenza, the intermediate town. The general cauſe, in the elements, had been four or five years in operation, producing a fatal ſpotted fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in moſt parts of Europe, continually increaſing in malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, until it aroſe to the plague, and its criſis muſt naturally be in places where it was moſt aided by local cauſes, or where the general cauſe firſt increaſed to its full force.</p>
                  <p>The ſlight peſtilences mentioned by Procopius and Evagrius, were the <hi>precurſors</hi> of the ſevere plagues to follow; preciſely as in London and Marſeilles, a terrible plague was preceded, in a former year, with malignant fevers and a few caſes of plague. All hiſtory affords a tiſſue of proof, that the plague is never an iſolated diſeaſe, ſtarting up ſuddenly from infection; but the <hi>criſis of a ſeries of violent diſeaſes.</hi> To this I challenge the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans of ſpecific contagion to name an exception.</p>
                  <p>In America, we are able to ſolve the phenomenon of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape of places intervening between infected towns. We find, without an exception, that when two cities are infeſted with peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence, and an intervening place is not, if that intervening town is to be attacked the following year, the precurſors of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe appear there, during the peſtilence in the towns on each ſide
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:036687_0523_100AA4CFD8D3A2F8"/>
of it. Thus the late ſeries of plagues <hi>began</hi> in New-York in 1791, in Water and Front ſtreets, where the <hi>local</hi> cauſes were moſt powerful. At this time, appeared ſporadic caſes of bilious fever, more malignant than uſual, in various parts of the country, every where, indicating the commencement of a peſtilential ſtate of air.</p>
                  <p>In 1792, theſe indications continued, and in a few caſes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the ſcarlatina, a new evidence of the reigning conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>In 1793, the criſis arrived in Philadelphia, with ſerious mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; and the indications of peſtilence appeared in a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of mortality, in many parts of the country.</p>
                  <p>At the cloſe of this year, New-Haven, which was to be next attacked, began to ſhow the forerunners of the diſeaſe, in the ſcarlatina, and in an increaſe of mortality of about one fifth. In the next ſummer 1794 appeared the bilious plague. In the ſame ſeaſon appeared the diſeaſe in Baltimore, diſtant from New-Haven about 290 miles, while Philadelphia and New-York, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening cities, eſcaped. But let it be obſerved, that a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of caſes of the diſeaſe occurred in Philadelphia; and New-York which was to be aſſailed in the next ſeaſon, produced its precurſors, in about thirty caſes of violent bilious fever, ending in black vomit. Thus while on the extremes, New-Haven and Baltimore were ſeverely viſited, the approaching peſtilence was announced in New-York, by a peſtilential atmoſphere, of a leſs degree of malignancy.</p>
                  <p>In 1795 appeared the epidemic in New-York and in Norfolk, Virginia; while Philadelphia and Baltimore, intermediate cities, eſcaped, altho the heat and humidity of the ſeaſon every where rendered the country unhealthy. In this year the peſtilential principle ſhowed itſelf in New-London and Providence, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly marked caſes of the bilious plague.</p>
                  <p>In 1796, ſcattering caſes occurred in the northern parts of America. In Newburyport, peſtilence prevailed, but preceded by an increaſe of mortality, its precurſor. The ſame diſeaſe prevailed in Boſton, New-York, and Charleſton, while inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate towns eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="unknown:036687_0524_100AA4D27970AA88"/>In 1797, it appeared in Providence, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Norfolk, while New-York eſcaped an epidemic, but a few very malignant caſes occurred, ſhowing the exiſtence of the general cauſe.</p>
                  <p>So far as I can diſcover, not a ſpot on the globe has ever been viſited with peſtilence, without its precurſors, ſometimes one, two or three years, but always for ſome months, before its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Thucydides relates that the year of the plague at Athens was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably free from other diſeaſes preceding, and that the plague fell ſuddenly on the citizens. This may ſeem an exception to my remark; but is not; for all the neighboring people were collected into the city; which was beſieged; a circumſtance alone ſufficient to account for the ſudden attack of the diſeaſe.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we had bills of mortality for Vicenza, in the years 1570 to 1576, or a hiſtory of the diſeaſes in the town, during that period, I pledge myſelf that we ſhould find, that during the plague in Verona and Padua, on each ſide in 1575, ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant diſeaſe prevailed in Vicenza, which greatly ſwelled the bill of mortality for that year, and which announced, with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infallible certainty, the approach of the plague. Inſtead therefore of ſaying Vicenza eſcaped the peſtilence, the firſt year, when Verona and Padua were afflicted, we ſhould ſay, the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence had <hi>commenced</hi> in leſs malignant diſtempers, but its criſis in Vicenza was to be a year later. This is the whole myſtery, and the uniformity of this ſeries of facts from the days of Procopius to this hour, renders it a matter of aſtoniſhment, that medical and other ſcientific men, ſhould have overlooked this great law of epidemic peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>Diemerbroeck remarks the fact, as well as Procopius and Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grius, that peſtilence does not invade all places at once, but now this place, now that, and thus, in a ſeries of years, extending over the earth. See p. 50 of Diemerbroeck, and the foregoing hiſtory of the plagues in Juſtinian's reign. But no author ſeems to have obſerved the progreſſion of a general peſtilential princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which, if it does not occaſion plague in two contiguous towns, the ſame year, occaſions plague in one, and other malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant diſeaſes in the other, which certainly indicate its approach.</p>

                     <pb n="170" facs="unknown:036687_0525_100AA4D491223330"/>To prove that infection has no concern in this laſt mentioned phenomenon, according to the theory of Mead and others, it may be obſerved that the invaſion of the diſeaſe in cities, is perfectly analogous to its invaſion of a whole country. The diſeaſe rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begins at one point and ſpreads from that, like the radii from the center of a circle, nor does it follow the nurſes and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the perſons firſt ſeized. On the other hand it ſtarts up in various diſtant parts of the town, among people who have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the infected. To this, it may be alleged, the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Philadelphia in 1793 and 7 are exceptions; but on crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical examination, I find they are not. That in New-Haven may be an exception. Thus Evagrius relates, that at the beginning, the plague ſeized particular families, ſometimes only one or two, and the reſt of the town eſcaped, till the next year.</p>
                  <p>Baronius from Gregory of Tours has well deſcribed the firſt progreſs of the plague, in 590, in the ſouthern cities of France. He ſays the diſeaſe was introduced by a veſſel from Spain; the firſt record I can find of ſuppoſed importation by water. But when introduced, it did not ſeize every houſe at one time but left intervals. "Nec ſtatim hoc incendium luis per domos ſpargitur totas, ſed interrupto certi temporis ſpatio, ac velut in ſegetem flamma accenſa, urbem totam morbi incendio conflagravit." Vol. 8. 15. The metaphor here employed will appear ſtriking to thoſe who have ſeen a field of ſtubble or the woods on fire, in a windy day. The fact alſo correſponds exactly with what has been obſerved in London, Marſeilles and other places, that the diſeaſe at firſt ſtarts up here and there, in remote ſituations; then ſubſides for weeks perhaps, before it ſpreads and becomes popular.</p>
                  <p>Thus in Nimeguen, a few caſes occurred in November; then there was an interval of ſuſpenſion; in January, more caſes, and in March, the diſeaſe began to aſſume the ſhape of an epidemic.</p>
                  <bibl>Diem. p. 6.</bibl>
                  <p>In London, ſays Hodge, two or three perſons died, in one family, with ſymptoms of the plague in 1664.—In the holidays, occurred another caſe—but a hard froſt ſuſpended the action of the infection. The diſeaſed were at firſt ſhut up and guarded; but to no purpoſe. An order was iſſued and enforced, that a red croſs ſhould be ſet on infected houſes, with theſe words inſcribed, "Lord have mercy on us."—</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="unknown:036687_0526_100AA4D617619880"/>In May and June the diſeaſe to uſe the author's own words, "reigned doubtfully;" ſometimes in one part and ſometimes in another; and to uſe Hodges quaint expreſſion, "it kept up a running fight," alternately inſpiring hope and fear. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription is leſs elegant than that of Baronius, but it expreſſes the ſame ideas of the firſt progreſs of the plague.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtrange however that the writers ſhould not have ſeen that their facts totally overthrow their own ideas of infection; it being impoſſible, that the operation of infection ſhould be thus ſuſpended, and afterwards revived. Froſt totally annihilates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, altho it does not deſtroy the atmoſpheric cauſe of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Similar, in all reſpects, was the commencement of the plague at Marſeilles in 1720. At firſt a few perſons died ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then the diſeaſe diſappeared, and the citizens ſuppoſed it to be ended. Repeated hopes and fears were revived by the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate appearance and diſappearance of the malady, for ſome weeks in May and June. Yet the author who has related theſe facts made a book to prove its origin from Levant infection! ſo abſurd are men when they attempt to ſupport preconceived ſyſtems!—</p>
                  <p>In America, the peſtilential fever has firſt made its appearance, in a ſimilar manner. It has every where been preceded by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of mortality, and in moſt places, has appeared in the ſcattering, interrupted manner of the plagues before mentioned. In Philadelphia in 1797, and ſtill more in 1798, ſcattering caſes occurred in June and July, ſeveral weeks before the arrival of the ſuppoſed fomites, from the Weſt-Indies. The ſame fact occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in New-York in 1795; ſome caſes appeared two weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arrival of the Zephyr, the ſuppoſed ſource of infection. In Providence occurred the ſame fact.</p>
                  <p>The whole ſecret of theſe phenomena, is, that infection has uſually nothing to do with the <hi>origin</hi> of the diſeaſe, according to the decided opinion of the learned Diemerbroeck, who ſaw the progreſs of the diſeaſe in Holland, and found it impoſſible to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it, in many places, to that cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why perſons are ſeized, in remote and ſcattered ſituations and after different intervals of time, is, that the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant principle is <hi>progreſſive.</hi> In its ſtate of increaſe, it firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:036687_0527_100AA4D84BAB4E00"/>
diſeaſes of a leſs violent type, and eſpecially all kinds of eruptive diſeaſes and catarrhous affections; as influenza, meaſles, ſmall-pox, every ſpecies of angina, petechial fever, and laſtly plague. In winter, the ſame cauſe often occaſions epidemic pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, or peripneumony of a moſt mortal kind, and always bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome likeneſs to the epidemics of ſummer and autumn.</p>
                  <p>In this progreſſion or increaſe of the peſtilential principle, thoſe perſons are firſt ſeized, who have the leaſt power of reſiſting its operation. This inability may proceed from various cauſes. It may be occaſioned by the natural organization of the body; ſome bodies being naturally more ſuſceptible of diſeaſe, than others. This indiſpoſition of bodies to repel the morbid action of air or other cauſes, is hidden from the eyes of man; but that it exiſts, we have proofs in every days experience.</p>
                  <p>Other perſons are prediſpoſed to certain diſeaſes by artificial means. Thus every exceſſive ſtimulus, induces indirect debility, a fruitful cauſe of diſeaſes. Hence the liability of robuſt people to all violent fevers.</p>
                  <p>Others may be expoſed to peſtilential diſeaſes from living in ſituations, where the peſtilential principle is aſſiſted in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the debilitating qualities of morbid exhalations. Hence the early appearance and furious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avages of the plague in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtreets of cities, and the filthy apartments of poverty.</p>
                  <p>From theſe and other cauſes, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> happens that ſome perſons are ſeized with peſtilence, long before the bodies of others yield to the action of the deſtructive cauſe. This will rationally account for all the variety of phenomena, which accompany this ferocious malady.</p>
                  <p>The ſame reaſoning applies to the angina maligna, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly another form of peſtilence. Fothergill relates, that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe appeared in London in a few caſes in 1739, and then diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for a period of two or three years. It did not become epidemic, tho very infectious.</p>
                  <bibl>Works, p. 198.</bibl>
                  <p>To confirm this hypotheſis, I may remark that the plague is leſs infectious on its firſt appearance. This is admitted by Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, on the plague of Aleppo, p. 19. 300, 297 and 315. At the ſame time, it is agreed on all hands, to be more mortal, than
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:036687_0528_100AA4DAEC487CA0"/>
in its later ſtages. If infection were the cauſe, the reverſe would be true, and the diſeaſe would be more mortal, in proportion to its extenſion, and the accumulation of infectious matter. The firſt caſes alſo would be equally infectious, within the reach of their effluvia.</p>
                  <p>Skenkius obſerves that many perſons lived in infected houſes, where others were diſeaſed, for three or four weeks, without any ill effects; but they afterwards ſickened and died. This he aſcribes to an increaſe of infection, and recommends, as the means of prevention, changes of clothes, and liberal uſe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the apartments. The fact may be explained on this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; or it may be, and moſt probably is, the effect of the ſlow operation of the morbid air in inducing debility on particular ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems. But it goes to prove that the infection of the diſeaſe is not ſpecific contagion, but a vapor or acid, unfriendly to health, that is capable of every imaginable degree of force; ſlighter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of which require a long time to undermine the energies of life.</p>
                  <p>Another conſideration, which decides againſt the origination of the plague from infection, is, that almoſt all other diſeaſes, whether infectious or not, exhibit the phenomena juſt deſcribed. It is not the plague alone that appears, this year in one town, and the next in a contiguous one; or this week in one family, and the next in another; or at the ſame moment, in two fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies or towns, at ſome miles diſtance. The ſame phenomena characterize dyſentery, meaſles, anginas and other maladies which are infectious; and even intermittents, remittents, and ſome others, which are not ſpread by infection.</p>
                  <p>Such was the manner in which the fatal dyſentery of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod about the year 1751, leaping from place to place, in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent years, ravaged Connecticut, for three or four years. The ſame took place, with that diſeaſe, from 1773 to 1777. It was ſcattering from place to place, during a ſeries of years, and then almoſt totally diſappeared, for many years. Sometimes it ſpread over a whole town; at others, it was limited to a particular ſtreet. In ſome inſtances, it ſwept away a large part of a fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily; in other inſtances, families entirely eſcaped. The ſame has been its progreſs, during the laſt five or ſix years. In 1794,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:036687_0529_100AA4DF4ED4E3E8"/>
it ravaged Derby; in 1795, New-Haven. In 1798, it invaded a particular ſtreet in the country, two miles from Stamford, was infectious and mortal, while the town generally eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>The ſcarlatina from 1793 to 1796, exhibited the ſame facts. Its general progreſs was eaſtward, but it often paſſed by a town and firſt ſeized one beyond it.</p>
                  <p>The angina maligna in 1735 and 6 was remarked for the ſame manner of appearance. It began in Kingſton, in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, but inſtead of a regular progreſs, ſtep by ſtep, it ſeized Boſton, fifty miles diſtant, before it did Cheſter, only ſix miles diſtant; yet its general progreſs was weſtward, and hardly any place eſcaped. Both this diſeaſe and the ſcarlatina of the laſt period, reſembled the plague in theſe other reſpects—they were moſt mortal at firſt; and they affected families with very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent degrees of violence, ſlightly troubling ſome, and extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lives of all the children in others.</p>
                  <p>The invaſion of the influenza exhibits ſimilar facts. It ſeizes at firſt only here and there a perſon; afterwards it becomes gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, as at Edinburgh in 1762. See Eſſays and Obſ. Edin. vol. 3. At other times, it has ſeized whole towns in a night; nor does it proceed from town to town, according to their order on a map. Yet its <hi>general</hi> courſe is in one direction.</p>
                  <p>I could produce a multitude of ſimilar inſtances of pleuriſy, and common autumnal fevers not infectious, which appear one year, in one part of the country, and another, in another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any viſible cauſe for this variety. The inſtances related by Dr. Buel of the town of Sheffield, are very diſtinguiſhed. See my Collection on the Yellow Fever, p. 53 and 60. That town contains two large ponds, which make conſiderable marſhes, that are ſources of remittents. In 1794, remittents of unuſual vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence appeared within the miaſmata ariſing from the ſouth pond —in 1795, a ſimilar fever raged in the vicinity of the north pond.</p>
                  <p>This appeared at firſt an unaccountable phenomenon; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the fever about the ſouth pond in 1794 was aſcribed to the drawing off the water, and expoſing great quantities of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcible ſubſtances to the action of heat. But ſtill the difficulty is not removed. The north pond is admitted to be the moſt
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:036687_0530_100AA4DD29A5BA58"/>
uſual and fruitful ſource of diſeaſes; but theſe did not appear, in any extent, in 1794. The queſtion then is, not why the diſeaſes occurred, in that year, about the ſouth pond, but why they did <hi>not</hi> appear about the north pond, the principal focus of ſickneſs in other years, and about which they raged with mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy effects in the two following years? No alteration is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to have been made in the circumſtances of the north pond; yet in one year, its exhalations were almoſt harmleſs, and in the next, they ſpread deſolation over the neighborhood.</p>
                  <bibl>See Medical Repoſitory, vol. 1. p. 458.</bibl>
                  <p>In ſuch caſes, juſt reaſoning leads us to ſuppoſe the general ſtate of the air or the local exhalations or both, differ materially in the degrees of their force and activity, in different years; but to human eyes, the cauſe of this difference is not often viſible.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a ſevere epidemic will rage in one town and a milder epidemic of a ſimilar type in the vicinity. Thus Zimmerman obſerves, that he has known a violent diarrhea follow a ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed perſpiration in September, in one town, when a dyſentery was epidemic in the neighboring country. To what ſhall we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute this difference of diſeaſes, within a few miles, of each other, but to the different force of local cauſes? A general cauſe, as a hot ſeaſon, may prediſpoſe the body to a diſeaſe of a particular type, but this principle may be modified by innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances on the ſurface of the earth.</p>
                  <p>In analogy with theſe facts, is the manner in which peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſeaſes invade different ſpecies of animals. In one place, horſes are ſeized; in another, cows; in a third, ſheep. In one year cats fall victims to peſtilence; and the next, hens and geeſe; but infection has no concern in theſe phenomena; and we are to aſcribe them to the various force of the peſtilential principle in different ſeaſons and places.</p>
                  <p>The phenomenon now under conſideration has not eſcaped the obſervation of other phyſicians in Europe. Stapfer, cited by Zimmerman on Phyſic, relates that the village of Oberwyl, in the Canton of Berne, was attacked with a violent dyſentery in 1749, while the neighboring villages were free from the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. In the next year, Oberwyl was healthy, while the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:036687_0531_100AA4E0F31550F8"/>
villages were ravaged with the ſame diſorder, tho not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the other by any mountain or foreſt. I have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſays Zimmerman, to obſerve ſomething like this, almoſt every year.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh Editor remarks on theſe facts, that "the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entery, like other contagious diſeaſes, is ſpread by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the infected perſons and clothes, and <hi>therefore</hi> it is not ſtrange that one village ſhould eſcape, if its inhabitants were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid communication with their infected neighbors."</p>
                  <p>Juſt ſo important are all the reaſonings of the infection-ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers! The remarks are common-place and do not reach the point of difficulty. The queſtion, is, to know why ſeveral villages eſcaped the diſeaſe, in the year when infection was <hi>near</hi> them, and were ſeized, the next year, when <hi>no</hi> infection exiſted. The winter's cold totally extinguiſhes the infection of that diſeaſe; ſo that the learned Editor is left without a reſource. If any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection had ſurvived the froſt of winter, it muſt have been in the village firſt infected, and in that place common ſenſe and obſervation would teach us to look for a revival of the diſeaſe, the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpring. But no; that village is in perfect health, and others, where there had been no fomites, are laid waſte by its ravages.— Such are the facts, and no theory of contagion is able to explain the cauſe of their exiſtence, in regard to this or any other diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The dyſentery alſo has, in ſome places, made the diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obſerved in the plague; ſeizing perſons of a certain nation or blood, and not affecting others who are equally expoſed. In an epidemic dyſentery in Nimeguen, the French and Jews all eſcaped.</p>
                  <bibl>Van Swieten, vol. 16. page 57.</bibl>
                  <p>There is a fact related by Hodges and Diemerbroeck reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the plague which muſt not be omitted. Many perſons who had breathed the peſtilential air of London and Nimeguen, went into the country, where they had the benefit of good air. Here they lived in health a month or two, then ſickened and died of the plague. This is attributed to the latent poiſon, which lies long inactive in the ſyſtem, then operates to the deſtruction of life. This may be the cauſe; but is it not more natural to aſcribe the fact to higher excitement from a pure air, on a debilitated
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:036687_0532_100AA4E3A65BFDF8"/>
ſyſtem, inducing indirect debility? Or ſhall we ſuppoſe that a peſtilential atmoſphere is moſt ſtimulant, and that a removal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a pure air, induces direct debility? Perhaps the following facts will throw ſome light on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>In 1789, I left Hartford in October, when the influenza was ſpreading in that town, and was ſeized with the diſeaſe juſt after I arrived at Boſton. A fortnight after, I returned, with two ladies who had lived in Boſton. In a week after my arriving at Hartford, the town of Boſton was attacked with the influenza, and the two ladies at Hartford were ſeized at the ſame time. The concluſion I draw from the fact, is, that the conſtitution of air, producing the epidemic, is ſome time in operation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its effects are viſible, gradually inducing a diſpoſition in the ſyſtem to that diſeaſe; and as it is progreſſive, it requires about the ſame time to run through its courſe in one place as in another, and is not always interrupted by local cauſes.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt incontrovertible evidence, that infection is not the primary, controlling cauſe of the plague, ariſes from the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which that epidemic ceaſes.</p>
                  <p>If infection were the principal and ſpecific cauſe of its propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, it muſt rage forever, or as long as any of the human race ſhould ſurvive to receive it; for the longer the diſeaſe exiſts, the more extenſive muſt it be. This concluſion is inevitable; for if infection ſpreads the diſeaſe ſo rapidly, that one or two diſeaſed perſons diffuſe it in a few weeks over a city, the ſame principle muſt, in a given time, extend it over the whole earth, unleſs its operation ſhould be arreſted by a ſuperior cauſe. And as one diſeaſed perſon is ſuppoſed to infect more than one healthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, its progreſs muſt be accelerated, in a duplicate, triplicate and quadruplicate ratio to its diſtance from its ſource. Its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity alſo muſt be increaſed, not only by numbers in a crouded city, but by an augmented virulence, until all the inhabitants ſhould be deſtroyed. But all this is contrary to fact.</p>
                  <p>Moſt plagues are modified and regulated by the ſeaſons; but the ceſſation of peſtilence in different countries, is in different ſeaſons, and ſeems to depend on oppoſite principles. In Egypt, a warm country, never reached by what may be called <hi>cold,</hi> the
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:036687_0533_100AA4E5DB82F800"/>
plague begins in winter, as in December, January or February; after the Nile has ſubſided within its banks, leaving extenſive plains and numerous canals, expoſed to a hot ſun; with a ſlimy ſurface and ſtagnant water in abundance, on the face of the country. During this period alſo blow the ſoutherly and ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating winds, hot and duſty, from ſandy deſarts, which may augment the cauſes of diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand, the diſeaſe ceaſes in June, when the Nile overflows its banks, ſpreading freſh water over the face of the country; at which time alſo begin to blow the cool refreſhing elyſian breezes from the north or Mediterranean ſea.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is obvious that the exiſtence of the diſeaſe depends on the general ſtate of the atmoſphere; for the inundation of the Nile certainly does not waſh away the infection from the houſes and clothes of the ſick. On the other hand, the plague ceaſes, when the infection is moſt general, and this is true in every inſtance.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid, that the plague ariſes from putrid exhalations in Egypt, and the reaſon why it ceaſes, on the riſing of the Nile, is, that the expanſion of freſh water over the country and a pure northerly air, deſtroy theſe exhalations.</p>
                  <p>In this obſervation there is truth; and it would account for the origin and the ceſſation of the plague, if it was an annual diſeaſe, regularly influenced and entirely governed by the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But here again we are overthrown; for in moſt years, putrid exhalations, which always exiſt at a certain ſeaſon, do <hi>not</hi> produce the diſeaſe. Thus we are driven to ſeek another cauſe, which is <hi>not</hi> influenced by ſeaſons; and to ſuppoſe its <hi>co-operation</hi> with hot winds and ſtagnant waters in the generation of the diſeaſe. This is moſt indubitably the fact.</p>
                  <p>Again, the plague in Syria, farther north, where ſome win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's cold is experienced, begins in ſpring, as in February or March, and ends in June and July, during the moſt exceſſive heat of the ſummer. This is the fact, from Aleppo to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and has been, from the earlieſt records extant.</p>
                  <p>Here then different cauſes, extreme heat and drouth, ſeem to control the rage of the plague. But does heat deſtroy infection? Never, unleſs by combuſtion. No degree of heat that is ever
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:036687_0534_100AA4E7709F9608"/>
felt in the tropical regions, or in America, has ever mitigated the force of infection, but always has increaſed it. Now we know, that the heat of Syria, never exceeds in degree what is annually experienced in the Weſt-Indies and the United States, to the 42d degree of latitude certainly, and probably to the 44th. In one reſpect Syria differs from this country; the ſummers are longer than in the northern ſtates of America, and the climate ſubject to drouth. But it cannot be the duration of the heat which deſtroys the plague; for that diſeaſe ceaſes at the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of ſummer. It abates in June, and rarely appears, to any extent, as late as Auguſt. Nor can we concieve why drouth in Syria ſhould put an end to the epidemic for in moſt <hi>other</hi> countries, it has not that effect. In Europe and America, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme drouth has very often inflamed its violence.</p>
                  <p>In this inſtance then we find no cauſe for the ceſſation of the plague, in the weather or ſeaſons, which we are able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. We know the uniformity of the fact; and all beyond this, is conjecture. Infection can have no concern in the effect; unleſs on ſome principle hitherto unknown, cool weather generates it and heat deſtroys it, contrary to facts in all other countries.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that the plague at Aleppo, Damaſcus, Said, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Latakia, and on all the Syrian coaſt, ceaſes in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hot weather, and when the infection is in its utmoſt extent and violence.</p>
                  <p>In Italy, Conſtantinople, in all Europe and the temperate lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itudes of America, ordinary plagues yield to cold; that is, they ceaſe as epidemics of that form; but the general cauſe never fails to ſhow its influence, in giving to the diſorders of winter, ſome of the general ſymptoms which characterize the epidemic of the ſummer. This proves that, in common peſtilence, morbid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations <hi>aid</hi> the atmoſpheric cauſe in producing the epidemic; and that it is not ſpecific contagion which contributes to ſpread the diſeaſe, for this is not influenced by cold; but it is morbid exhalations, that yield to cold. Hence, in northern climates, cold ſuſpends the action of the two ſubordinate cauſes of peſtilence, morbid exhalations and infection; and this is uſually ſufficient to check the epidemic.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="unknown:036687_0535_100AA4E9EA81F540"/>But that the great primary cauſe, is not affected or rather ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by cold, is apparent from theſe facts; that altho the plague, in its peculiar autumnal form, is ſuſpended, yet the diſeaſes of winter, as pleuriſy and peripneumony, wear the ſame character; which can be occaſioned only by the continued action of the ſame cauſe. Further, ſome plagues have not yielded to cold, as I have before obſerved. Several inſtances have occurred, in which the diſeaſe has run through all the ſeaſons without interruption or abatement. This fact demonſtrates that the primary cauſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting in the eſſential properties of the elements, may be of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous degrees of force, and at times does actually ariſe to a degree, capable of producing and continuing that diſorder, not only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aid of morbid exhalations and infection, but in defiance of cold.</p>
                  <p>In conformity with this idea, is the fact that a peſtilence which begins the earlieſt in the ſeaſon, is the moſt mortal. This is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed by P. Alpinus, Van Swieten and Sydenham, "Minus ſaeva eſt, quo tardius illuc acceſſit, viderique incepit; ita ut quo tardius venerit, eó mitior ac brevior ſit judicanda," ſays Alpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Rerum Egypt, Vol. 3. 70. The reaſon of which is, that in proportion to the ſtrength of the elemental cauſe, it begins to exhibit its effects early in the ſeaſon; that is, with the <hi>leaſt aid</hi> from heat, noxious effluvia or other local cauſes.—If the general contagion of the atmoſphere is very powerful, its effects may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear even in winter, in oppoſition to cold; hence the juſtneſs of Diemerbroeck's remark, that peſtilence beginning in winter, is the moſt fatal. If, on the contrary, the general conſtitution of the air is leſs hoſtile to life and health, it will not produce an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic peſtilence, till it is aſſiſted by great heat and local vitiation of the air; therefore the diſeaſe will not appear, till late in the ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>Something like this, on a ſmall ſcale, has characterized the different epidemics in Philadelphia. In 1793, the precurſors of the epidemic were light, and the firſt caſes did not appear, till the laſt of July or beginning of Auguſt. In 1797 and 98, the firſt caſes occurred in June, and the diſeaſe in the latter years, was marked with by far the moſt malignant ſymptoms, altho the
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:036687_0536_100AA4EC5710F7E0"/>
timely evacuation of the city prevented bills of mortality equal to that of 1793.</p>
                  <p>In New-York, this circumſtance, it is believed, has been leſs noticeable; but it may be remarked, that in the years of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, the firſt caſes occurred in the laſt week in July, and in years, when a few ſporadic caſes<note n="*" place="bottom">The advocates of the ſpecific contagion of the plague do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the true plague ever appears in ſporadic caſes. They think, if it once appears, its contagion muſt of neceſſity, ſpread it. This is all a whim. I believe, with Dr. Mitchell, that any diſeaſe of the worſt type, may be generated in the body, ſolely by a derangement of the functions of the ſtomach and inteſtines, and the poiſonous air extricated from food. But that ſporadic caſes of plague may occur and do occur very often, I have not the leaſt doubt. During the late war, in 1776 or 1777, two brothers by the name of — arrived from the army at Greenwich in Connecticut—one had a malignant fever, with glandular tumors; the other was his nurſe and in good health. The ſick man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoon after he arrived, and in leſs than 24 hours, his brother was alſo in his grave. This was true plague; but no other attendant was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.—</note> only have appeared, they have not occurred till many weeks later. Beſides, it is very obvious that the diſeaſes of 1795 and 6, if not of 1797, were powerfully influenced, in their commencement, by local cauſes; as great maſſes of putrid matter, in the parts of the city, where the firſt caſes occurred, and where the epidemic exhauſted its principal force.—</p>
                  <p>In general, it may be obſerved in our climate, that if a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever does not appear, in a city, till late in Auguſt, the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens need not apprehend very general deſolation. If caſes occur early, as in June, there is ſerious ground for apprehenſions of danger. The only exception to theſe remarks, is, when the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſuffer ſome great, unuſual and ſudden viciſſitudes, which, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a peſtilential period, may overwhelm a city with almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous calamity.—Such may be a ſudden invaſion of heat in Auguſt, after preceding cool weather.</p>
                  <p>In general it is a juſt remark, that as the force of the peſtilential principle, is of various degrees, in different periods, ſo when it is moſt powerful, it attacks men the earlieſt in the proper ſeaſon, and is deſtined to be the moſt deſtructive.</p>
                  <p>The preceding facts and concluſions ſeem ſufficient to eſtabliſh the great point, that neither contagion nor infection has ever had much influence in originating or propagating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="182" facs="unknown:036687_0537_100AA4EF62D0E720"/>But objections remain to be anſwered. It is alleged that the plague begins in maratime places and thence ſpreads into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try adjacent. Thus it is aſſerted by the college of phyſicians in Philadelphia, that the peſtilential fever in America "commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces invariably in our ſea-ports, while inland towns, equally expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the ordinary cauſes of fever, eſcape." Memorial, dated Dec. 5, 1797.</p>
                  <p>Pliny, a great obſerver of facts in the natural world, goes far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and aſſerts, "That peſtilence is obſerved always to proceed from ſouthern regions towards the ſitting ſun; nor does it ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever happen otherwiſe, except in winter."</p>
                  <bibl>Lib. 7. Cap. 50.</bibl>
                  <p>Mead and the author of Traité de la peſte have cited this opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with approbation. By the words of Pliny "a meridionis partibus, ad occaſum ſolis," muſt mean from Egypt and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary coaſt, towards Italy, Gaul and the other weſtern parts of Europe.</p>
                  <p>From theſe facts, is inferred a ſtrong argument in favor of the propagation of that diſeaſe by contagion.</p>
                  <p>With deference to theſe great authorities, not one of theſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions is accurate. That the plague generally appears firſt in ſea-ports, is a juſt remark, and according to the laws of nature, it muſt be ſo, without infection. But to this rule there are many exceptions. The general plague in the days of Thucydides origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Ethiopia, near the borders of upper Egypt, <hi>not a ſea-port.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The violent plague in 252 began in the ſame region; as did that of 1736.</p>
                  <p>The plague of 542 began in Lower Egypt, between Peluſium and a moraſs, called the Serbonian bog, at a diſtance from the port of Peluſium. It ſhould have been mentioned that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal plague in the reign of the Antonines began in Seleucia, on the Tigris, far from the ſea. The black peſtilence of 1348 origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in China. That of 1450 in ſome parts of Aſia. The peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of 1348 began, when it firſt appeared in France, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vignon, <hi>not</hi> a ſea-port; as did that of 1482. The plague of 1575 in Italy, began at the northward, in Trent, and proceeded ſouthward, contrary to the aſſertion of Pliny; and every one
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:036687_0538_100AA4F10645D5C0"/>
sknow Trent is not a maritime place. The plague in Holland in 1663, began in Heuſden, <hi>not</hi> a ſea-port, but on a river and near a moraſs. In 1702, a plague broke out in Poland, far from the ſea.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the United States, the aſſertion of the College of Phyſicians muſt ſtand or fall, according to the definition of the fevers which have appeared in the country. If no peſtilence has ever appeared, except in ſea-ports, we muſt affix ſome other name to the mortal epidemics that viſit the interior of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Certain it is, contrary to the ſtatement of the College of Phyſicians, that the true yellow fever, and ſo called at the time, prevailed in Albany in 1746.</p>
                  <p>About the marſhes in the interior of our country, an epidemic bilious fever has times without number, raged as fatally, as ever it did in Philadelphia, deſtroying life in three or four days, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with all the characteriſtic ſymptoms of yellow fever and carrying off almoſt every perſon, within the region of its atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere. This has happened, about ſome of the lakes in the ſtate of New-York, every year ſince the preſent peſtilential period com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, and whole villages have been depopulated. If the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Phyſicians chooſe not to call this diſeaſe yellow fever, I cannot help it; but ſure I am, if it is not that ſpecific diſorder, it is one equally deſolating, and as little entitled to be fathered on the country, as any ſpecies of plague whatever. It is a fact alſo that the bodies of thoſe who periſh by that fever near rivers and lakes, are, if poſſible, more yellow than in cities.</p>
                  <p>But what utterly diſproves the aſſertion of the College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, is, that the ſame peſtilential diſtemper which has lately afflicted our cities, appeared among the aborigines of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, before it was ſettled by the Engliſh, before the Weſt-Indies were ſettled by the Engliſh or French, and before a ſingle veſſel from the iſlands had ever reached our ſhores. To confirm this fact, it is well known that the ſame diſeaſe has often viſited them, ſince the Engliſh ſettlements, and in ſituations and under circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when it was not poſſible for them to receive it from infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as at Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in 1763, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times, in the limits of the preſent ſtate of Rhode-Iſland.
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:036687_0539_100AA4F4839C4930"/>
The Onandagoes in the ſtate of New-York, three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles from a ſea-port, about eighty years ago, were attacked with peſtilence, which waſted the tribe; and the place where their village was then built, has, on the account of that mortality, been ever ſince abandoned, and is now overgrown with trees. The ſame happened among the Senecas at a later period.</p>
                  <p>What the diſeaſe among the Onondagoes was, I am not inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it might have been the ſmall-pox; but the country where it happened, is now ſubject to mortal bilious epidemics, which kill in three days, and turn the body as yellow as ſaffron. Beſides the great plague of 1618 is known to have been the true infectious yellow fever, and ſo was the fever of Nantucket in 1763, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which could poſſibly have been imported.</p>
                  <p>About ſixty years ago, a great mortality happened among the Indians, on the north eaſt of a ſmall ſtream, a little ſouth of Eaſt-Greenwich, in the ſtate of Rhode-Iſland. The diſeaſe was fatal to almoſt all who were affected; but it was local, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious, for a law was paſſed that no perſon ſhould go from one ſide of the river to the other, and the Indians on the oppoſite ſide remained in health. This place was no ſea-port, but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian hamlet; and no pretence of importation is ſuggeſted, nor does it appear, that any whites were affected.</p>
                  <p>About twenty-ſix years ago, a malignant bilious fever attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Indians, at Quidneſit neck, in North-Kingſton, in the ſame ſtate, and moſt who were ſeized, periſhed. It attacked alſo a few families of whites, but with leſs mortality. North-Kingſton is a ſea-port, but there is no ſuggeſtion of foreign origin.</p>
                  <bibl>M. S. of Moſes Brown of Providence.</bibl>
                  <p>From theſe facts let the public judge how little reliance can be placed on general aſſertions even of learned and reſpectable ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, when made without a critical examination of the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>It is proper that I ſhould here take notice of an aſſertion, found in a number of authors. "That Thucydides relates the plague, in his days, to have ſpread from Ethiopia by means of contagion, infection or fomites." The learned Diemerbroeck has fallen into this miſtake. p. 48.</p>
                  <p>Galen is more correct, when he ſays, that peſtilence ſpread by the corruption or infection of the air. This idea, tho not
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:036687_0540_100AA4F70FBAA450"/>
the expeſſion, is accurate. The truth is, Thucydides does not ſay, the diſtemper ſpread by infection or contagion. A literal tranſlation from the Greek is as follows. "It began as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, firſt from Ethiopia, above Egypt; then it fell on Egypt and Lybia, and a great part of the King's dominions (Perſia.) It then ſuddenly invaded the city of Athens and firſt the Pieraeus." In the paragraph preceding he ſays, the diſeaſe had prevailed in many regions firſt and eſpecially at Lemnos; but does not hint at infection or contagion as the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The obſervation of Pliny, that peſtilence originates in ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern climates and proceeds northward and weſtward, is generally, but not always true. Alexander Ruſſel tells us, the peſtilence in Aleppo in 1719 came from the northward; and many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors relate that it appears in Conſtantinople or Smyrna, before it does in Egypt. This may be partly owing to alterations in the Turkiſh cities, ſince Pliny's time.</p>
                  <p>But on juſt principles, the fact is rationally explained. If a particular ſtate of air, favorable to the propagation of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, muſt exiſt, before it can become epidemic, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the friends and foes of contagion, then ſuppoſing this <hi>general</hi> peſtilential principle to exiſt, at a given time, in equal force, all over the earth, or any portion of it; it muſt follow inevitably, that this general cauſe will produce the worſt diſeaſes <hi>firſt</hi> in climates and ſituations, where the moſt powerful <hi>local</hi> cauſes exiſt, as heat, moiſture, and all kinds of deleterious exhalations. And for a moſt obvious reaſon; the debility of the human body muſt be firſt induced in thoſe ſituations.</p>
                  <p>This is a complete ſolution of the fact mentioned by Pliny; and he himſelf juſtifies this explanation of it, for he excepts from his own general rule, the peſtilence that appears in winter, a circumſtance paſſed over by Mead. Now the reaſon why a plague beginning in winter does not follow the courſe of one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in ſummer, but appears ſometimes in northern climates <hi>firſt,</hi> is, that ſuch a peſtilence does not require the aid of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent cauſes, as noxious exhalations. It is independent of <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cauſes,</hi> and induced ſolely by the eſſential qualities of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere; it may therefore appear firſt in any place or climate
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:036687_0541_100AA4F8960C7478"/>
whatever, according to that ſtate of air. This happens only in great plagues which ſeldom occur.</p>
                  <p>Theſe obſervations apply alſo to the objection that peſtilence firſt appears in maritime places, as mentioned by Procopius, and others.</p>
                  <p>It is a fact known to every medical man that humidity is a cauſe of debility. Hear what the learned Zimmerman ſays on this point.</p>
                  <bibl>On Phyſic, vol. 2. p. 100.</bibl>
                  <p>"The humidity of air weakens a man ſuddenly; it relaxes the ſolids, and of courſe weakens the circulation, ſo that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions are carried on with difficulty. The inſenſible perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is checked, the moiſture paſſes in through the abſorbing pores of the ſkin, and the patient feels a laſſitude and heavineſs, which deprive him of all his gaiety, and render the mind as oppreſſed as the body"—"Damp ſituations are, in every country, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy."</p>
                  <bibl>p. 102.</bibl>
                  <p>There is not a perſon living who cannot teſtify to the truth of theſe remarks. Hence the languor which depreſſes man, in a hot ſultry day, with a ſoutherly light air, <hi>loaded with vapor.</hi> Hence this ſtate of the air, when of long continuance, never fails to generate epidemic diſorders; and if it occurs, during a peſtilential conſtitution, mankind ſeldom eſcape the ravages of the plague.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid that the inhabitants of maritime towns, are leſs expoſed to this ſource of debility, than ſeamen, who are in general remarkably healthy. To which I anſwer, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary moiſture from ſea air never of itſelf produces diſeaſes; and at ſea, there exiſts no exciting cauſe, as morbid exhalations, unleſs in ſhips of war and crouded tranſports, in which diſeaſes often proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed from human effluvia. But I queſtion whether the bodies of ſeamen poſſeſs the ſame firm texture as thoſe of laboring far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the country. Certain it is, that ſeamen are in general not ſo long-lived men, as farmers. This is aſcribed to their ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and ſevere fatigue; but I ſuſpect it more owing to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant operation of the debilitating powers of moiſture.</p>
                  <p>Whatev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r may be in this, it is certain that moiſture of <hi>itſelf</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces

debility, in a greater or leſs degree, tho not diſeaſe; but when its action on the ſyſtem is combined with the operation of morbid exhalations, which abound in cities, eſpecially near navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable water, together with the frequent alternations of heat and cold, occaſioned by the contiguity of land and water; we are not to be ſurpriſed that cities on the borders of the ocean, and the banks of rivers, are the firſt to be attacked with peſtilence. We might, without the aid of facts, prove a priori, that this muſt generally be the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Hodges mentions that the London plague of 1665 ſpread into the adjacent country, <hi>eſpecially along the Thames;</hi> but he takes care to aſcribe this to infected goods, and not to humidity—a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother proof of the miſchiefs of theory.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the circumſtance that next to large maritime cities, the towns ſituated on the borders of rivers or lakes, are the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely harraſſed with epidemics of a fatal kind, eſpecially autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſeaſes, is an evidence of the truth of the ſame principle. Wherever we turn our eyes, we ſee autumnal diſeaſes, from ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tertians to the plague, moſt frequent and moſt deadly, in low ſituations, under the combined operation of heat, moiſture and different ſpecies of noxious exhalations. It is therefore as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philoſophical to deduce, from this fact, arguments in favor of the foreign origin of the plague, as in favor of the importation of many other malignant diſeaſes; for the ſame phenomena attend them all—they all appear <hi>firſt,</hi> and are moſt epidemic and fatal, in the vicinity of water. This is their general rule, to which exiſt ſome exceptions, as well in regard to the plague, as to other bilious complaints.</p>
                  <p>But the diſcovery of a general peſtilential principle, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a whole hemiſphere, or the whole globe nearly at the ſame time, or with a rapid progreſſion, ſolves all the difficulties on this ſubject. Had Pliny known, that at the moment a ſevere plague appears in Egypt, the diſeaſes of all Europe, or all the world, aſſume unuſual malignancy, or other contagious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious epidemics appear, in every quarter, to the diſtance of a thouſand leagues, his remark would have been equally juſt, as to the origin and progreſs of the plague, but it would have opened to him new cauſes of its origin, and a more juſt and philoſoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:036687_0543_100AA4FC9A9D6E48"/>
view of the phenomenon. This is a diſcovery which proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates all theories of ſpecific <hi>contagion,</hi> and reduces the influence of <hi>infection</hi> to its juſt meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Another fact. Foreſtus has declared that in peſtilence, three times the number died in wet weather, as in fair and dry weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; the infection being leſs eaſily diſperſed, in wet weather, which is evident from the ſmoke of chimnies.</p>
                  <bibl>Van Swieten, vol. 16. 26.</bibl>
                  <p>It is well known in America, that while the weather is hot, rains and moiſt air greatly multiply caſes of peſtilential fever.</p>
                  <p>In 1720 a ſtorm of thunder and lightning at Marſeilles, late in July, was followed by a great increaſe of the plague.</p>
                  <bibl>Traité de la peſte.</bibl>
                  <p>Every one knows that the air, along the borders of the ocean, corrodes iron and other metallic ſubſtances. Is it not then queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable whether the ſaline acid, which impregnates the maritime air, has not ſome deleterious effect on the human body, when combined with other vapors from the earth? Are we yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the eſſential properties of all the poſſible combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of aerial ſubſtances?</p>
                  <p>Again; Mead has remarked, that countries and cities which have had moſt commerce with Africa, as Marſeilles, have been moſt frequently afflicted with the plague. A French author, he ſays, reckons 20 plagues that have infeſted Marſeilles, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding its healthy ſituation.</p>
                  <p>In oppoſition to this, it may be proved by facts, that the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, in the interior of Germany, that never had any trade or connection with Egypt, uſed formerly to be harraſſed with that diſeaſe, nearly, if not quite as often as the maritime ports of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France, Spain or Italy. Any man will learn this, who reads the <hi>whole</hi> hiſtory of that calamity, inſtead of that of a few detached inſtances.</p>
                  <p>As to the twenty plagues of Marſeilles, aſcribed to the trade with Egypt, I would obſerve, that I can produce the hiſtory of near double that number of violent plagues in London, <hi>before</hi> that city had any trade or connection with Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Equally ill founded is the idea of medical writers that the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever of the Weſt-Indies was brought firſt from Siam. "Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adie
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:036687_0544_100AA4FF35877DC0"/>
de Siam," is the name given to it by French phyſicians; and this improper name, will ſerve to perpetuate the error, while it ſhall exiſt as a monument of ignorance and falſe philoſophy. This pretended Siam fever was the peſtilence of the Indians, on this continent, before the Weſt-India Iſlands were ſettled by the French or Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>Another extraordinary aſſertion of Mead, is, that "the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern nations of Europe, before their connection with Africa in trade, grew populous more rapidly, than in modern times."</p>
                  <p>I will not conteſt the aſſertion, as it regards the degree of pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation of thoſe countries, in different periods. Authors differ in opinion on the ſubject of the ancient population of Europe, and no certain documents or facts exiſt by which the point can be aſcertained.</p>
                  <p>But the implication neceſſarily deduced from Mead's aſſertion, is, that the plague is more frequent and deſtructive in the north of Europe, ſince a trade has been opened with Egypt, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; for on this principle only would he account for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced population of modern times. If this is what he meant to inſinuate, the aſſertion is not ſimply inaccurate, but abſolutely falſe. From the firſt accounts we have of Ruſſia, Poland and the Baltic regions, to the firſt opening of a trade with Egypt, in modern days, plagues were much <hi>more frequent</hi> and fatal in thoſe countries than they have been, within the laſt century, ſince a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant trade has been carried on with Egypt and every part of the Levant. For the truth of this aſſertion, I appeal to facts.— In the year 1485, the Engliſh firſt opened a trade to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, eſpecially with Italy, and a conſul was appointed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident at Piſa. The act of appointment by Richard 3d. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains this paſſage "whereas certain merchants and others, from England, <hi>intend</hi> to frequent foreign parts, and chiefly Italy, with their ſhips and merchandize"—Before this, England had little or no trade, <hi>directly</hi> with foreign countries. All her trade was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Lombards, Genoeſe, Venetians and the Hanſem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. There was no direct trade to Egypt and the Levant.</p>
                  <p>About the year 1511, Engliſh ſhips began to frequent Sicily, Candia, Chios and the Syrian coaſt; but this was accounted a
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:036687_0545_100AA50242F4AEF0"/>
very hazardous voyage, and ſhips ſeldom made it in leſs than a year.</p>
                  <p>In 1535 Engliſh factors firſt ſettled in thoſe countries.</p>
                  <bibl>See Anderſon's Commerce, vol. 1. 683. vol. 2. 79. Rymer's Federa, vol. 12. 261, and Hackluite Voyages, vol. 2. 96.</bibl>
                  <p>Now, the fact is, that the plague was as frequent and ſevere in England, Denmark, Sweden and Germany, in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, before any foreign trade exiſted, as in any later period. Not to mention the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal plague in the days of Vortigern, about 448, which never has been exceeded in extent and violence, unleſs by the black peſtilence of 1348.</p>
                  <p>The Levant Company was firſt eſtabliſhed by Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth in 1581, and the act of incorporation expreſsly ſtates that "Sir Edward Oſborn and his aſſociates, the perſons incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had at their own great coſts and charges, <hi>found out and opened</hi> a trade to Turkey." Before that time the commodities of Egypt, Syria and Turkey were all imported from Italy, ſo Venetian or Genoeſe ſhips.</p>
                  <p>The commerce of the North of Europe from the year 1200 to 1500, was almoſt wholly in the hands of the Hanſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ic Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy; but on careful inveſtigation, I cannot find the leaſt trace of a direct trade to the Levant, by the towns in that league. Indeed before the diſcovery of the mariner's compaſs, in the 14th century, all trade was carried on by coaſting. Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory records more than one hundred general plagues before that diſcovery. So totally falſe is the aſſertion of Mead.</p>
                  <p>But ſay the College of Phyſicians, in the memorial before cited, "proper health laws, ſtrictly enforced, have latterly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the commercial parts of Europe from its ravages." This is a point of importance, and while the aſſertion ſtands unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by proofs, I am at liberty to deny the truth of it, and there leave the queſtion, as fair on one ſide as the other; for I cannot prove a negative. If however health laws have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the effect alleged, it is very ſtrange that the plague did not diſappear at a much earlier period.</p>
                  <p>The inſtitution of health laws was as early as 1484, and it appears they were firſt introduced at Venice. If theſe laws have
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:036687_0546_100A89D90C9D4750"/>
ever prevented an epidemic plague, it is very ſtrange, that they were ineffectual in Venice and other parts of Italy, for near two hundred years, as they certainly were. It is indeed wonderful that, during the 16th century when all Europe was almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ravaged by that diſeaſe, and down to the cloſe of the laſt century, no man could be found to deviſe a law, and no police, to enforce it, ſo as to arreſt the progreſs of the plague in Italy. Yet ſuch was the fact.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſtatute, I believe, in England to reſtrain the progreſs of infection, was in 1604, in the firſt ſeſſion of James I. 31. The regulations attempted by the proclamation of Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth in 1580, before recited, prohibiting the enlargement of London, and the reſidence of more families than one in the ſame houſe, could not, from the tenor of them, be carried into effect. The ſtatute of James limits its proviſions to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of the ſick to their houſes, a breach of which was made felony. An enforcement was attempted in the ſubſequent plagues, and eſpecially in 1665, but without the leaſt good effect, as to the city at large, and with a very ill effect upon the diſeaſed and their families. It is certain however that a ſtrict execution of ſuch a law, would arreſt the progreſs of <hi>infection,</hi> for the infection of the plague is found and admitted on all hands to be confined to contact or very near approach, ſo as to be received by the breath of the diſeaſed. If therefore the diſeaſe were propagated by infection only, ſuch confinement of the ſick would check its progreſs, if not annihilate it. We know by repeated experience in America, that there is not the leaſt difficulty in putting an end to a diſeaſe ariſing ſolely from ſpecific contagion; and it has often been done in caſes of the ſmall-pox. Hence the inefficacy of the law of James I. after repeated trials in the plague, is a ſtrong evidence that its propagation depends on ſome other cauſe than infection.</p>
                  <p>From 1604, to the reign of Queen Anne, no general laws were enacted on this ſubject, as far as I can diſcover from the printed ſtatutes. In the 9th year of Queen Anne, 1709, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the firſt ſtatute enjoining veſſels to perform quarantine; at leaſt I can find none earlier. This was repeated by 26th.
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:036687_0547_100AA506A707A748"/>
George 2, 1752, a new ſtatute on the ſubject, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards amended by the 29th of the ſame reign. Now it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that the plague ceaſed in London in 1666, forty-three years <hi>before</hi> a general quarantine was inſtituted. Particular laws had been paſſed before, on emergencies, as in 1664, when all importation of goods from Holland, was prohibited, on account of the plague, then in Holland; but without effect. The truth then, is, ſo far as regards Great-Britain, now the moſt commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial country on earth, and at the time in queſtion, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial, next to Holland, the plague entirely ceaſed and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, 43 years before the exiſtence of quarantine laws. If any miſtake occurs in this ſtatement, it muſt proceed from want of materials—my enquiries are limited to Blackſtone and the printed ſtatutes at large, the only documents I poſſeſs on that ſubject.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of my reading, I have found but two or three inſtances, in which it has ever been <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> that health laws have preſerved a city from peſtilence. Mead mentions two inſtances; one at Ferrara in 1630, where every perſon, ſeized with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, was immediately removed to a Lazaretto; which being done in ſeven or eight inſtances, the diſeaſe was checked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared.</p>
                  <p>Another inſtance he mentions was at Rome in 1657, where the perſons firſt ſeized were removed to Lazarettos and their fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilies to hoſpitals without the city, and the city was ſoon freed from the diſorder. He ſuppoſes further that the diſeaſe was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended a whole fortnight in Marſeilles, in 1720, by the ſame means.</p>
                  <p>I have no account before me of the origin and progreſs of the plague, in Italy, 1630 and 1657, except the ſketches found in Mead's works, but wherever I can obtain a correct account of this diſeaſe, mentioned alſo by Mead, I find his ſtatements are imperfect and erroneous; I therefore place very little dependence on them. That the plague in Marſeilles was ſtopped a fortnight by regulations of policy, is not true. The diſeaſe appeared in the preceding autumn, and was ſuſpended five or ſix months by the winter. When it appeared in the month of May 1720, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:036687_0548_100AA508C18E1DF8"/>
ſay, the firſt caſes were among thoſe who had intercourſe with the ſhip and goods from Said; but all thoſe goods were prohibited to be carried into the city, and ſubjected to fifteen days retreat and purification. The porters who had concern with them were confined. Some weeks after, in the month of June, caſes of the diſeaſe appeared in the city; all precautions had proved fruitleſs; as the hot weather came on, the diſeaſe ſtarted up here and there in the city, among perſons who never had any concern with the ſhip or the goods, or the infected; it then ſubſided; then again appeared, in the manner before related.</p>
                  <p>Whether the perſons ſeized in May contracted the diſeaſe from the goods or foul air of the ſhip, or not, is not material; for the goods were cleanſed, and all the diſeaſed confined to the hoſpital, and all the porters ſhut out from the city. Yet when the diſeaſe appeared in the city, no perſon could tell how it came there; many were ſeized who had never been near infection; and hence the populace reſort to ſuppoſition to account for its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igin —they <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> the diſeaſe had come from the goods after they were cleanſed, tho they had no evidence of it. Beſides I have before remarked under the year 1720, that the goods could not be infected, for it is admitted on all hands that they were ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at Said, when the diſeaſe was <hi>not</hi> in that port. The ſhip's hold might have generated foul air on her paſſage, and the firſt perſons connected with her might have contracted a peſtilence from that air, which is not an uncommon thing, in ſuch a very ſickly period, as that was, when mortality was increaſed all over Europe and America. But the truth is, had that air been the cauſe of the plague in the city, the diſeaſe would not have been ſuſpended for ſix weeks, but would have made a regular progreſs from one patient to another. But no; it diſappears for ſix weeks, and then breaks out in parts of the city remote from the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſource of infection, and among people who had not been near that ſource. So inaccurate and inconſiſtent appear all accounts of the contraction of epidemic diſeaſes from fomites, which I have been able to inveſtigate by full and authentic documents. This ſhows how little reliance we can place on partial ſtate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ents, made to ſupport favorite ſyſtems. I therefore am perſuaded that
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:036687_0549_100AA50A47E19FB8"/>
the caſes mentioned by Mead of the effectual reſtraint of the plague in Italy by removing the ſick, are not fully ſtated, and that an accurate enquiry would prove the ſuppoſed effect to reſult from other cauſes.</p>
                  <p>The following facts will furniſh a more rational ſolution of the phenomenon.</p>
                  <p>In the United States, ever ſince the commencement of the preſent conſtitution of air, that is, from 1790, ſporadic caſes of our peſtilential fever have occurred, not only in cities, but in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts of the country, more or leſs, every ſummer and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn. In 1792 occurred a number in New-York; alſo in 1794 when one caſe exhibited infection; and in 1797. Of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty caſes perhaps, in each year, ſome of them were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively violent, highly marked, and in a degree, infectious. In 1791 and in 1796, ſeveral hundred caſes appeared, yet the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was not epidemic, but local, and the buſineſs of the city was not ſuſpended. Now had every perſon, the moment of his ſeizure, been conveyed out of the city to a hoſpital, the eſcape of the city, in each of theſe years, would vulgarly have been aſcribed to that circumſtance. This was doubtleſs the caſe in Ferrara and Rome, and this is unqueſtionably the ſolution of the fact, that the caſes in the Italian cities, were ſporadic caſes, which always occur in the neighborhood of the plague. This diſeaſe, in the years mentioned, raged in other parts of Italy; the caſes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Mead were ſporadic caſes, indicating a peſtilential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of air, extending to thoſe cities, but of a leſs malignancy, and too mild to produce a general peſtilence in thoſe places; it affected only a few perſons of habits moſt ſuſceptible of it; and to theſe it probably would have been limited, had none of them been removed.</p>
                  <p>A ſimilar fact occurred in Philadelphia in 1794. Eighty or a hundred perſons died that year of the true yellow fever; none of them were removed; but to theſe was limited the operation of the peſtilential principles, local and general; and no epidemic enſued.</p>
                  <p>In New-London a caſe occurred in 1795; and in 1796 ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral caſes of the ſame diſeaſe; but no epidemic, altho no remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the ſick took place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="unknown:036687_0550_100AA50C8668A7D0"/>In Providence, ſporadic caſes have occurred almoſt every year, with ſymptoms of the infectious yellow fever. In 1791, in June, died two daughters of a widow, in the center of the town. They vomited bilious matter, and their bodies were yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, with livid and purple ſpots. Other caſes occurred the ſame year; one caſe in 1792, and a number in 1793, 4 and 5; caſes which could not poſſibly have originated from foreign ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Some of them appeared to be infectious, as that of the young women firſt mentioned, the firſt being taken on the 4th of June and dying on the 7th; the ſecond being ſeized on the 9th, and dying on the twelfth. Yet no epidemic followed; and had theſe patients been removed to a diſtant hoſpital, the ſafety of the town would have been aſcribed to that removal, and the ſalutary effect of health laws would, by Mead's followers, have been trumpeted over the country, and what is worſe, would have been recorded as an important fact, which would hereafter miſlead poſterity.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is more dangerous than to build a theory, or to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a general principle on a few detached facts, inaccurately ſtated, and ill-underſtood.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the caſe of Rome ſtated by Mead, it muſt be obſerved, that the diſeaſe had, in the preceding year, killed 10,000 of its inhabitants, and in the kingdom of Naples 400,000. The diſeaſe had probably finiſhed its courſe in that region, and the few caſes in Rome in 1657, were only detached inſtances, the remains of the peſtilential cauſe; ſuch as occurred in London in 1666, after the fatal plague of the preceding year. It is by no means probable that the diſeaſe, if neglected, would have become epidemic.</p>
                  <p>But we have ſtronger ground to oppoſe the idea of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Phyſicians, relative to the effect of health laws. Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous examples are on record, in which the full force of the beſt regulations to prevent peſtilence, has been applied in vain; and ſince the publication of the memorial of the College, from which this idea is taken, Philadelphia has witneſſed the futility of ſuch regulations, in two melancholy inſtances.</p>
                  <p>In 1636, the law to prevent infection was rigorouſly executed in Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="196" facs="unknown:036687_0551_100AA5D6983C73D8"/>
but all to no purpoſe; the diſeaſe ſpread, the legal reſtrictions were then taken off, and no ill effect followed; the diſtemper ſpread no faſter than before.</p>
                  <p>In 1665, the ſame regulations were tried in vain; and ſo was the law, prohibiting the importation of goods from Holland.</p>
                  <p>The approach of peſtilence towards Dantzick in 1708, in which year it appeared at Thorn, alarmed the magiſtrates of the former city, and every poſſible precaution was uſed to prevent its reaching Dantzick. Commerce and communication with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and ſuſpected places were forbidden; no ſorts of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize, eſpecially thoſe which are moſt apt to retain infection, were permitted to enter the city from ſuch infected places; all ſtrangers and travellers were ſtrictly examined, and none ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to enter the city, without ſufficient proof of coming from healthy places; all the inhabitants were cautioned not to hold correſpondence with infected places, nor to harbor thoſe who came from them. Theſe and other regulations were enjoined by an edict in July 1708. Yet all to no purpoſe; the plague appeared at Dantzick, the next ſpring.</p>
                  <bibl>Baddam's Memoirs, vol. 6. p. 6.</bibl>
                  <p>This is a remarkable inſtance of the futility of human regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, when oppoſed to the laws of the phyſical world. The people of Dantzick, had they been acquainted with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of peſtilence, might have foreſeen in 1708, the probability of the inefficacy of their regulations. The ſtate of the air in the production of millions of ſpiders, and the increaſing mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in the city, indicated the exiſtence of a ſtate of the air, unfriendly to health, which was increaſing and only required a little more virulence to generate the evil, which they ignorantly ſuppoſed muſt come in ſick bodies, goods or old clothes; and which they were idly combatting on that miſtaken principle.</p>
                  <p>It has already been ſtated that the rigorous execution of health laws at Marſeilles in 1720, proved utterly fruitleſs.</p>
                  <p>The plague which deſolated Naples in 1656 was ſaid to be introduced into that city by ſoldiers from Sardinia, where it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the preceding year. Yet the Viceroy, Count Caſtrillo had prohibited all intercourſe with Sardinia. After the diſeaſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared which was firſt in the form of a malignant fever, without
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:036687_0552_100A8A7E13E8A248"/>
glandular tumors, all poſſible means were uſed to prevent its ſpreading, but to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The confidence in modern health laws, is like the reſpect which the ancient Egyptians paid to the bird, Ibis, which, they ſuppoſed, averted the plague by deſtroying the flying ſerpents that the hot Lybian winds brought into the country.</p>
                  <bibl>Cicero de Nat. Deor. lib. 1. 36.</bibl>
                  <p>The Egyptians were like all modern nations—unwilling to believe the plague generated at home—they aſcribed it to infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion brought by flying ſerpents, as the moderns aſcribe it to old clothes, bales of goods and infected ſhips. They miſtook the cauſe, adored Ibis, as the moderns do, quarantine, and with the ſame ill ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>But we need not ſtep off of our own territories to find evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the inefficacy of health laws, when oppoſed to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration of the laws of nature. No expedient has been left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried to ward off the calamity of peſtilence, but without any viſible effect. The ſeverity of the affliction in Philadelphia, in former years, had rendered the magiſtracy of the city extremely careful to guard againſt importation in 1798. The moſt rigid qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>antine was exacted—ventilators of the beſt conſtruction em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed —the veſſels were waſhed, fumigated, white-waſhed with lime, and every practicable mode of purification adopted. Not a veſſel was ſuffered to approach the city, without ſatisfactory evidence of the healthy ſtate of the people, and the ſalubrity of the veſſel and cargo. See the letter from Hillary Baker, Eſq. mayor of the city, to the mayor of Baltimore, dated Auguſt 13th, 1798. Alas! all to no purpoſe! The ravages of the diſeaſe are well known.</p>
                  <p>If, ſays the late worthy mayor, the diſeaſe has eluded the health officers, I ſhall deſpair of future ſucceſs, unleſs the Weſt-India commerce ſhall be prohibited in the ſummer months, and magazines eſtabliſhed below for receiving the cargoes.</p>
                  <p>Similar proviſions in other ports have been eſtabliſhed with no better ſucceſs. The health laws at New-York, ſo far as appears, were as well executed in 1795, 96 and 98, when the fever was epidemic, as in 1794 and 97 when it was <hi>not.</hi> No viſible good effects are to be diſcovered in guarding againſt an epidemic; the

utility of cleanſing veſſels therefore is limited to guarding againſt the operation of infection, upon a few perſons who may enter them, with foul air on board. Public health, ſo far as can be diſcovered, has never been ſecured by thoſe regulations.

                     </gap> years preceding 1792, no peſtilential fever ever ſpread in America, from the ten thouſand infected ſeamen and paſſengers, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the country from the Weſt-Indies, and during which time, in moſt places, not the leaſt precaution was ever uſed to guard againſt it; yet ſince 1792, that is, under a ſtate of air, generating various epidemics, the peſtilential fever has appeared in ſporadic caſes, every year and in almoſt every town in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, and has raged as an epidemic in moſt of our large towns, in oppoſition to the utmoſt efforts of human ſkill. I am perſuaded, the concluſions from theſe facts amount to demonſtrative evidence, that infection is <hi>not</hi> the principal, or cauſe ſine qua non, of this terrible calamity.</p>
                  <p>The application of quarantine laws to our epidemic peſtilential fever, is juſt as uſeleſs, as the order of the Sultan, Achmet I. in the waſting plague of 1613, for tranſporting all the cats in Conſtantinople to the iſland of Scutari. The Jewiſh phyſicians told the Emperor, that the plague was occaſioned by the cats, and the poor cats were diſpatched into exile. Yet this did not reſtrain the plague.</p>
                  <p>People have been forever miſtaking the cauſe of the plague. In the firſt centuries of the chriſtian era, when diſputes ran high between Chriſtians and Pagans, theſe ſects mutually charged the plague each to the other. In 1349, the Germans aſcribed the plague to the Jews, and maſſacred great numbers of that race. In Paris, during a plague, many proteſtant <hi>heretics</hi> were ſacrificed, for bringing the calamity upon that city. And a propoſition has been made in America to ſtop all intercourſe with the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and the Mediterranean, during the ſummer months! Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing blindneſs!</p>
                  <p>But, it will be aſked, ſhall we have no health laws? I anſwer, by all means. Their utility is obvious on many occaſions. Thus when an infected fleet arrives in a port, the town is in eminent
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:036687_0554_100A8A811D1FE6F0"/>
danger, of what may be called a jail fever on a great ſcale. The quantity and virulence of infection thus imported, have produced deſtructive conſequences, as at Breſt in 1757, where were lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in November and placed in hoſpitals, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſed ſeamen and troops from ſhips, moſtly out of De la Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te's fleet, from Louiſburg, with a malignant fever on board. The effect was that ten thouſand men died, in the hoſpitals, the ſucceeding winter, and many of the inhabitants of Breſt. But it will be remarked, that this infectious diſeaſe did not become an <hi>epidemic</hi> in Breſt; it ſpread only by infection; and as ſoon as that was diſſipated, the diſeaſe diſappeared. It raged in winter and ſubſided in ſpring. This is an important diſtinction, always to be obſerved by thoſe who guard the public health—an <hi>epidemic</hi> peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence begins when the ſeaſon or the ſtate of air favors it, and rages without control, againſt all human efforts; the common air becomes tainted, ſo as to produce the diſeaſe, without the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting principle from bodies or clothes, and the diſeaſes ſubſide on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the command of the ſeaſons and the elements. Againſt ſuch, no legal proviſions are or can be of any avail, and ſuch is uſually the yellow fever of our country.</p>
                  <p>But diſeaſes propagated only by infection, like the jail and ſhip fever, never put on the form of an epidemic. They rage in crouded priſons and ſhips, where they are generated; and when multitudes are crouded into hoſpitals, they carry the evil with them; and all perſons, coming within reach of the infection, are liable to ſuffer. In this manner, Breſt loſt many of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; a town in America is ſaid to have done the ſame, from the yellow fever, imported in Sir Francis Wheeler's fleet, as already related. But in ſuch caſes, the infecting diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires contact or near approach to aid its propagation; and does not aſſume the complexion of an epidemic. The two ſpecies of diſeaſe are as diſtinguiſhable as light from darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus, at the Black aſſizes in Oxford, in 1577, a malignant or jail fever of a ſingular kind, was produced ſuddenly—almoſt all the court and ſpectators were ſeized—many died—but no epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic followed in Oxford; and in this inſtance, the effect was ſo ſudden, that the human body did not generate infection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="unknown:036687_0555_100A8A82ACBE9318"/>So alſo at the Old Bailey, not many years paſt, a few priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, entering the court from a dirty jail, without changing their dreſs, infected a large number of perſons who died; but no epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic followed—the infection was ſoon diſſipated, and there was an end of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>With our peſtilential fever, this is not the caſe, nor with any epidemic plague that ever exiſted. Remove the ſick, cleanſe the houſes and clothes, do whatever human art and labor is compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to effect, all will not avail—caſes ſpring up in every quarter, and the diſeaſe takes its courſe.</p>
                  <p>So it was in Candia in 1592, as related from Thuanus, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that year. As ſoon as the plague appeared, all the ſick and all the ſuſpected were removed from the city; but to no purpoſe; it raged till July—then abated without any human means and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived again in October.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſays the author of Traité de la peſte, "Univerſal clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings have proved uſeleſs; the plague has ravaged places after ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery precaution; and after negligence it has entirely ceaſed, as in Naples."</p>
                  <p>Such are the facts; and hence the neceſſity of diſtinguiſhing carefully between <hi>epidemic</hi> peſtilence, proceeding principally from general cauſes in the elements, and marked by other epidemic diſeaſes, by the failure of vegetable productions and by the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or death of cattle, fiſh and other animals—and <hi>diſeaſes merely infectious,</hi> generated by artificial means, which <hi>may</hi> be communicated, which may happen in jails, ſhips and camps, in the healthieſt ſtate of the elements, and which ceaſe, as ſoon as the infection can be diſſipated by purifications and freſh air. Without this diſtinction, the merit of legiſlative and police-regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, can never be duly appreciated. Such regulations, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to <hi>epidemics,</hi> as they continually are, prove totally futile— applied to diſeaſes of mere infection and of ſpecific contagion, as jail fever and ſmall pox, they may be and often are the means of preſerving multitudes of lives.</p>
                  <p>It is important therefore that health laws ſhould be judiciouſly framed and ſtrictly executed, becauſe there <hi>may</hi> be caſes in which public health will be preſerved by them; altho they never can
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:036687_0556_100AA5102D830040"/>
reach the cauſe or prevent the ravages of epidemics, which orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate where they exiſt.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to merchant-men, health-laws may alſo be of ſome uſe, in preſerving the lives of ſeamen, and of perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the veſſels. Sick men may generate a ſmall degree of infection; but on board of merchant-men, the number of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men is too ſmall to infect a ſhip, ſo as to endanger public health, unleſs ſhamefully neglected.</p>
                  <p>The moſt danger from merchant-men is from the foul air gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, on long voyages and in hot ſeaſons, from periſhable and fermenting ſubſtances. From ſuch vitiated air, deprived of its vital principle, great danger may ariſe to the perſons who firſt open and enter the holds; and perhaps to a neighborhood. It is of great conſequence therefore to uſe ventilators freely on board of veſſels, freighted with periſhable articles; and to have them effectually cleanſed, before they are ſuffered to approach our wharves.</p>
                  <p>But I am not convinced that the air of ſuch veſſels ever yet <hi>originated</hi> an epidemic fever. It appears to me, that the Acad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy of Medicine in Philadelphia, lay more ſtreſs on this cauſe, than it deſerves. The ſphere of the operation of ſuch a ſmall morbid cauſe, cannot be extenſive; and all the foul air of the largeſt veſſel muſt be ſo attenuated by diffuſion, as not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce deleterious effects, at any great diſtance. It may be inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to a ſmall neighborhood; but I do not conceive it poſſible, that the noxious air of a few ſquare yards, can impregnate the whole atmoſphere of a city; and as to infection from the ſick, I have repeatedly proved, that this can never produce an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic. I will admit the <hi>bare poſſibility,</hi> that imported infection may enkindle the flame of peſtilence, in a place fitted for it by local cauſes, where no peſtilence would appear without a ſpark from infection. This is as much as I can admit to be poſſible, and more than I believe; after a more minute and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>areful inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of facts probably, than was ever before made in America. Moſt of the caſes I can find, where accurate accounts are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, of ſuppoſed importation or communication of autumnal diſeaſes, fail utterly of proofs to ſupport common opinion; and
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:036687_0557_100AA511B9CAA998"/>
many of them are incontrovertibly proved to have had their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin in the places where they have exiſted.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſy, I aver, to diſtinguiſh, in every caſe, the nature of peſtilence; that is, whether it is an epidemic, proceeding from a ſtate of the elements, or a diſeaſe generated ſolely by foul air, artificially collected. In a few weeks, if not a few days, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe will ſhow whether it proceeds from infection only or from a general elemental ſource; and when it appears to proceed from the elements, men may juſt as well attempt to ſave the cats, the wild animals or the fiſh in the ocean from the effects of that principle, as their own ſpecies, by laws enjoining quarantine and purification of ſhips. The ſame cauſe that deſtroys the cats or the fiſh in one caſe, deſtroys human life in the other; and that cauſe exiſts in the elements; it is at home; quarantine laws do not reach it.</p>
                  <p>An epidemic diſeaſe may be diſtinguiſhed from a diſeaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from infection or ſpecific contagion, by the following cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. An epidemic peſtilence is preceded by influenza, affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the throat, or acute and malignant fevers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. An epidemic predominates over other diſeaſes; totally abſorbing them or compelling them to aſſume its characteriſtic ſymptoms. This laſt circumſtance is deciſive of the character of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>A diſeaſe propagated by contagion or infection only is not thus diſtinguiſhed. It has no precurſors, it extends and ſpreads only by contact or near approach; and has no effect on the diſeaſes in its vicinity. The ſmall pox or jail fever, depending on mere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, never expel a dyſentery or intermitting fever.</p>
                  <p>In every poſſible caſe, a plague that baniſhes other diſeaſes, as I believe it always does, is an epidemic generated in the place where it exiſts; for it is not poſſible that this expulſion of other diſeaſes, could take place, unleſs the epidemic depended ſolely on the elements. Simple infection would not change the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of another diſeaſe, even in the next houſe, much leſs in all parts of a city.</p>
                  <p>To ſhow how little an epidemic depends on infection, let us advert to facts. In all the eaſtern countries, the plague is ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:036687_0558_100AA513F6DE0540"/>
to take its own courſe without reſtraint. There are no regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to control its progreſs, or prevent its return. Its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is uſually gradual; a few die the firſt year; the proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſuſpends its progreſs; the next year it is more general, and often, the third year is the moſt fatal.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable, that after its moſt extenſive effects, it abates and ſuddenly diſappears. In London, the malignant precurſors of the plague of 1665, appeared as early as 1661; but no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had its criſis paſſed, than in a few months, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> was totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. The ſame happened at Aleppo in 1, 62, and ſuch is uſually the fact.</p>
                  <p>Let any man ſuppoſe the diſeaſe to be propagated wholly or moſtly by infection, and attend to the conſequences. In Alep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po, ſays Ruſſel, died 500, in 1760; in 1761, died 7000, and in 1762, 11,000. On the principle of infection then, ſome ſick man or a bundle of old clothes, firſt ſpreads the diſeaſe, ſo as to deſtroy 500 lives—the infection of 500, deſtroys 7000 lives, the infection of 7000, deſtroys 11,000 lives; and the next year, the infection of 11,000 deſtroys—none at all!</p>
                  <p>In London, a few bales of cotton, ſmuggled into the city from Holland, in 1664, communicated infection that deſtroyed 68,000 lives; the infection from this immenſe number proves fatal, the next year, to 1900 only; and theſe, the year following, infect only 35! If infection has much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in propagating that diſeaſe, its operation certainly defeats all arithmetical calculation of its phyſical powers!</p>
                  <p>The whole theory of infection, to which Mead has given ſo much celebrity, and which is maintained by many phyſicians in this country, is abſurd and ridiculous from firſt to laſt; leading legiſlators, magiſtrates and citizens aſtray from the truth, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing moſt ſerious inconveniences to commerce, and preventing the adoption of the only means of mitigating the peſtilence to which our cities are expoſed.</p>
                  <p>In Turkey and Egypt no pains are taken to cleanſe houſes or clothes after a plague. No ſooner has a great plague ceaſed, which has cut off 300,000 people in Conſtantinople or Cairo, than the infected houſes are filled by other people, who replace the dead, uſe the furniture and the bedding on which the infected
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:036687_0559_100AA515BAD8E548"/>
had died; or the old clothes are ſent to auction and purchaſed by Jews, who retail them out for uſe, uncleanſed; and yet amidſt all this maſs of concentrated infection, no perſon has the plague, or if a ſporadic caſe occurs here and there, no epidemic enſues, for two, three or four years, perhaps longer; then all at once, when the infection muſt neceſſarily be deſtroyed, by the action of air and water, the diſeaſe breaks out again, and becomes epidemic. Then ſome arrival from an infected place is hunted out, and the calamity is charged to the account of ſome poor ſick ſeaman, or his clothes! The infection of half a million of people, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces no plague in one year; but in another, the inviſible fomes of a piece of cloth, or the breath of a ſingle man is ſufficient to ſpread deſolation over a great city, or a kingdom!<note n="*" place="bottom">Hodges informs us, that after the plague in London, in 1665, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple returned into houſes not cleanſed, and even ſlept in beds on which the infected had died, without fear or injury. This is not at all ſtrange. Unleſs the effluvia from the ſick have been cloſely confined and are greatly condenſed, they will not affect a well perſon; and indeed it is a difficult thing to preſerve the morbid matter, in ſufficient quantity to communicate diſeaſe in cold weather.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such are the abſurdities of the modern notions about the plague, which adorn this ſplendid era of philoſophy and ſcience!—</p>
                  <p>Of the nature of the infecting principle in diſeaſes, we know very little; and even its effects are not always comprehenſible. We obſerve differences alſo in the operation of the principle, which we cannot explain. Why the ſmall-pox ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, under <hi>all</hi> circumſtances; the plague only under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain circumſtances, is a myſtery not yet unfolded. It is ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the diſeaſed body diſcharges certain fine poiſonous parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which are ſuſpended and diffuſed in the air, and being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed by the pores of the ſkin, and with the breath, excite the ſame ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies of diſtemper in a healthy body. Theſe effluvia generally eſcape our ſight and very often our other ſenſes; but they may be concentrated in ſuch quantities, as to be very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the olfactory organs, and even to excite ſudden nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea in the ſtomach.</p>
                  <p>But why the effluvia from the ſmall-pox, anginas and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſles ſhould be independent of heat and cold; and thoſe of dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entery, plague, and other typhus fevers, ſubject to be excited
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:036687_0560_100AA51772E455E8"/>
into action by the one, and to be deſtroyed by the other, is a phenomenon never yet explained. We may ſay the particles iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing from the former claſs, are more ſubtle, volatile, and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating; but this is all conjecture. Certain it is, that the poiſon of ſmall pox, angina and meaſles, is of a more diſtinct, ſpecific kind, than that of the plague, leſs connected, in its operation, with putrid exhalations from other bodies, and leſs ſuſceptible of grades in its powers.</p>
                  <p>So far as I am able to comprehend the nature of the infection of plague and other autumnal diſeaſes, paſſing under the popular name of <hi>putrid,</hi> it appears to conſiſt of a ſpecies of air, which is one of the elementary parts of all vegetable and animal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. It may be what Dr. Mitchell denominates, the <hi>ſeptic acid;</hi> that fluid which is diſcharged from fleſh in the proceſs of putrefaction. It may be ſome other ſpecies; but it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from all its effects, that it operates, in producing diſeaſe, no otherwiſe than all the morbid exhalations extricated from ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpecies of vegetable and animal ſubſtances in the putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proceſs. In all or moſt of ſuch ſubſtances, there is, it is well known, a ſpecies of air or acid matter, which, when in a form detached from other ſubſtances, is highly noxious to health. To this fluid, or ſeptic acid, evolved from vegetables in a ſtate of natural putrefaction, and floating in an aerial form, is aſcribed the whole claſs of bilious fevers, which prevail near marſhes.</p>
                  <p>Hence, the effluvia from a perſon laboring under the plague, are ſuſceptible of all degrees of concentration, and in proportion to their concentration, will be their violence, and certainty of effect, when they attach themſelves to a healthy body. In this reſpect the infe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on of the plague differs moſt eſſentially from that of the ſmall pox. The matter of contagion in the ſmall pox, however ſmall, is ſufficient to communicate the diſeaſe; and it is cuſtomary for phyſicians to wipe clean the point of a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, dipped in variolous matter, before it is inſerted in the ſkin, for the purpoſe of inoculation. It is alſo proved by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that the quantity of infection introduced by inoculation, whether more or leſs, makes no material difference in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of puſtles, or violence of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="206" facs="unknown:036687_0561_100AA5191D0F4CF0"/>But in the plague, the operation of infection is very different. This diſeaſe, if light, produces no infection, or very little— more violent caſes appear to be more apt to be communicated— and in great plagues, the infection is viſibly augmented. Yet in moſt peſtilences, an inſtantaneous expoſure to the effluvia from the ſick will rarely produce any effect, as in the caſe of ſmall pox and meaſles. It uſually requires a perſon to be a conſiderable time in the room with the ſick, in the plague, to receive poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous air ſufficient to excite diſeaſe; and more generally, it is not communicated, without handling the ſick or imbibing his breath. In many caſes, all this expoſure for weeks and months together, will excite no diſeaſe. Hence Ruſſel repreſents the plague, as of different degrees of malignity and not always infectious. Hence the propriety of cloſe and indefatigable attention, in peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence, to every article of cleanlineſs; for by this means, the quantity of infection is reduced, and the danger diminiſhed, from a high degree down to nothing. Not ſo, in ſmall-pox and meaſles, the contagion of which regards no filth or cleanlineſs.</p>
                  <p>The infection of the plague, dyſentery and the like ſeems therefore, to be nothing more than an <hi>acceſs of noxious matter, to the local cauſes, morbid exhalations.</hi> The noxious air of filthy ſtreets, docks and tenements, are ſecondary and augmenting cauſes of the plague; when the diſeaſe appears, the effluvia from the diſeaſed ſtill <hi>augment</hi> theſe other lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al cauſes. Thus when a certain ſtate of air, in a city generally, will produce a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fever, and perſons are expoſed to it by walking in the ſtreets, a ſick perſon, confined in a cloſe room, will ſoon fill that room with exhalations from his lungs and pores, which will render that room <hi>more dangerous</hi> to a perſon in health, than the open ſtreet. This ſeems to be the amount of the infection of plague and other autumnal diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo in a violent plague, the common air of the ſtreets becomes ſo highly infected, that perſons attending the ſick can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly determin whether they take the diſeaſe from the common atmoſphere, or from their intercourſe with infected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The only caſes which afford certainty in this reſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t, are, when the diſeaſed are removed into the pure air of the country,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:036687_0562_100AA51D54A4CA40"/>
and nurſes and viſitors, who have breathed no peſtilential air in the city, are taken ill, in a few days after ſuch intercourſe with the ſick. Theſe would be clearly the produce of infection. But theſe caſes rarely occur. It has already been obſerved that the worſt caſes of peſtilence removed into the country, ſeldom infect the attendants. This ſhows how little apprehenſion ought to be excited by mere infection, and how ill-founded are the alarms in the country, about the ſpreading of the yellow fever; alarms that often occaſion a neglect of diſeaſed fugitives from the city. People in the country have little to fear from infection, if the ſick are kept in airy rooms and cleanly; they ought not to abandon the ſick; for the duties of humanity are not incompat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible with their ſafety. It is the infected ground, if I may ſo call it, the local atmoſphere of peſtilence which is to be dreaded, and eſpecially by ſtrangers. During its prevalence, in a city or town, the air of the place is rank poiſon to perſons, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to good air.</p>
                  <p>The preceding facts and diſtinctions enable us to form a juſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate of the importance of health laws. In nine caſes of ten, in which quarantine is enjoined, human efforts are oppoſed to the great laws of nature, and are therefore uſeleſs. In all caſes, where the air of a country exhibits evidences of a peſtilential conſtitution, in an increaſe of the number and violence of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of common diſeaſes; in the production of certain epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics, as catarrh, anginas, meaſles, petechial fevers and the like; in the death of fiſh or the unuſual diſeaſes of cattle and other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imals; in the production of inſects, uncommon in ſize, in kind or numbers; and other remarkable phenomena, before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; in all ſuch caſes, the peſtilence which invades man will be found to ariſe ſolely from the uncontrollable laws of the elements; and quarantine will be utterly unavailing to guard cities againſt its introduction and ravages. The remedy is not applied to the ſource of the diſeaſe. Hence the efforts of the police in London in the laſt century, and of Dantzick and Marſeilles in this, were entirely uſeleſs; and hence the failure of all health laws to ſave our cities from the late epidemics.</p>

                     <pb n="208" facs="unknown:036687_0563_100AA51EDB96DDC0"/>Satisfied as I am of this truth, I would not lay aſide the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of theſe laws. The bare poſſibility of ſaving the lives of a few individuals, and eſpecially of diſeaſed ſeamen, is a good reaſon for cleanſing ſhips after long voyages, and of purifying their cargoes, when in a bad ſtate. But what I contend for, is, that we muſt not expect the beſt health laws, moſt rigorouſly executed, will ever be ſucceſsful in g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ions, we expoſe ourſelves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſappointment; we expoſe the lives of citizens; we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the true cauſes of the evil, and neglect the only means of preventing or mitigating its effects.</p>
                  <p>Further, the opinion of the ſpecific contagion of the plague has originated many, not only uſeleſs, but barbarous regulations. Such is the practice of confining the ſick to cloſe houſes; and ſtill more, of confining the citizens of an infected town within its limits, by an armed force—which I am informed has been done in Europe. In Marſeilles, the firſt perſons ſeized were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to their houſes by the point of the bayonet.</p>
                  <p>An ignorance of the nature of a diſeaſe and its degree of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, may be pardonable in a prince or the legiſlators of a free ſtate. But there is a point, beyond which ignorance in medical profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, becomes a crime. No ſcience is neceſſary however to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince any man, that moſt peſtilences, proceed only from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged ſtate of the elements, aided by the morbid exhalations of cities. This is a fact that may be known to a certainty by very little reading and obſervation. It was well known in paſt ages, when men were more governed by obſervation, than by theories and erroneous reaſoning. Mead's attempts to prove the ſpecific contagion of plague, aided by his popularity, had a moſt ſurpriſing ſucceſs; his treatiſe was received as a ſtandard of truth; it every where ſuſpended enquiries and checked a ſpirit of inveſtigation, which might have diſſipated error; it was the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the preſent laws of quarantine, which are applied, in thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of caſes, where they are as improper and as little wanted, as if applied to prevent an epidemic pleuriſy, or head-ache, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſing commerce, without the ſhadow of neceſſity. But theſe are not the worſt effects. The erroneous ſyſtem of ſpecific con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:036687_0564_100AA520AC820EE8"/>
has miſlead mankind into a fatal ſecurity, on the ſubject of the local cauſes of diſeaſes. Suppoſing the laws competent to guard public health, men have not attended to the beſt modes of conſtructing houſes and cities, and to the means of watering and cleanſing them—means by which all the ſlighter peſtilences might be avoided, and the more ſevere ones, greatly mitigated. Hence I am perſuaded, that the received theory of ſpecific contagion is the direct cauſe of moſt of the fatal plagues that now ſcourge civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilized Europe and America. For it will be obſerved, that peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence has always been the <hi>peculiar curſe</hi> of <hi>populous cities.</hi> Of about two hundred general plagues, recorded in hiſtory, a few only have been ſo violent as to ſpread over countries into villages and farm houſes; almoſt all have been limited to large towns, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonſtrating that they would never have affected man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, without the influence of the impure air generated in thoſe places. This is a truth, as unqueſtionable as it is important; and on a conviction of this hangs the ſafety of men from that dreadful calamity. Had Mead, and other eminent phyſicians taken the ſame pains to lead mankind into truth, as into error, we ſhould long ago have introduced improvements into the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement and ſtructure of our cities, which would have ſecured our citizens from nine tenths of the infectious diſeaſes, by which they have been alarmed and diſtreſſed.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, had men underſtood the common operation of infection, which may be made obvious to the moſt ordinary minds, merchants would not, at this day, have been harraſſed with the neceſſity of performing quarantine, to guard againſt <hi>epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic</hi> diſeaſes. We ſhould not have ſeen a ſhip from the Weſt-Indies condemned to the flames, in a Britiſh port, becauſe ſhe had loſt her crew by the yellow fever; nor merchantmen from an American port obliged to ride quarantine in the Britiſh chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, becauſe that diſeaſe prevailed in this country. Phyſicians, had they not been blinded by ſyſtem, and taken opinions for granted, without enquiry into the grounds on which they reſt, would have known before this, that the yellow fever will not ſpread in England, Scotland or Ireland. It never ſhows itſelf
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:036687_0565_100AA5230D8741C0"/>
in America, without a much greater degree of heat, than the ordinary ſummer temperature of thoſe countries. The heat in thoſe latitudes rarely exceeds, for a few hours, in a ſingle day, 75 or at moſt 78 degrees by Farenheit. But no epidemic yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever is ever generated, in our climate, with that degree of heat. In general, we never ſee caſes of that diſeaſe in America, until we have had a period of heat riſing, for a conſiderable time, to 85 deg. or higher. In any ſeaſon of ordinary temperature, the yellow fever, in the Britiſh kingdoms, and other parallels of latitude, introduced from abroad by ſeamen or others from war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer climates, would immediately ſubſide and be extinguiſhed, without any human efforts. The caſes of malignant fever in England, which turn the body yellow, and which ſometimes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, as mentioned by Lind, are generated about marſhes, in hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals, camps, ſhips and priſons. An epidemic yellow fever, like that which prevails in America, was never known in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and probably cannot exiſt in the climate. The quarantine enjoined on veſſels from the Weſt-Indies and United States, is utterly uſeleſs in guarding that country from this peſtilence in the form of an epidemic.</p>
                  <p>It m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y be ſaid, in anſwer to theſe remarks, that the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and plague are eſſentially the ſame diſeaſe; the plague has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten raged in Great Britain, and therefore the climate may not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the prevalence of the yellow fever.</p>
                  <p>But if the plague has raged in Great Britain, which is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it muſt have ariſen from the unhealthy ſtate of the elements, which may exiſt in any latitude, or from very ſingular ſeaſons, aided by moſt powerful local cauſes, as in London before it was burnt. I ſay the yellow fever will not ſpread in England, in the <hi>ordinary</hi> ſtate of the elements, and the <hi>ordinary</hi> temperature of the ſummer. If peſtilence ever invades cool northerly countries, it muſt always proceed principally from diſorders in the elements and ſeaſons. The ordinary cauſes, in temperate or cool cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, have but little influence in generating peſtilence. Hence in common ſeaſons, in England, no plague, bilious or inguinal, could be ſpread, unleſs in a crouded jail, camp, or dirty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined alley in a city. If the phyſicians in England obſerve the
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:036687_0566_100AA52694DF8950"/>
general ſtate of health to be good; no epidemics, with unuſual ſymptoms, prevailing: no uncommon numbers of inſects; or diſeaſes among cattle, or other ſymptoms of a morbid ſtate of the elements, it is no more in the power of man to render the plague epidemic in that country, than it is the pleuriſy or quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey. I challenge all the faculty in Europe, to mention an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in which plague has ever prevailed, without ſuch phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, it ſeems to be probable, that more heat is neceſſary to generate and to propagate the bilious, than the glandular plague. My reaſons for this opinion, are, that the glandular plague appears in ſpring much earlier than the bilious. It often appears in the northern parts of Europe, as early as March and often in May, when the weather is yet cool. But the bilious plague of our climate has not ſhowed itſelf, in ſporadic caſes, till June, and then very rarely, and only in a few ſcattered caſes of a leſs malignant type, than at a later ſeaſon. To this remark, I have heard of only one exception. Generally, the diſeaſe does not appear till we have experienced ſome days of our hotteſt weather, and not till the laſt week in July, except in a few caſes as before mentioned. It does not become formidable, as an epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic, till the tenth or twentieth of Auguſt.</p>
                  <p>This difference ſeems to depend on the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The glandular plague of Europe, Aſia and Africa, when it breaks out in the northern latitudes, as on the Baltic or in Great Britain, ſeems to be more eſſentially and principally the product of a defective ſtate of the elements, joined to human ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations in large cities; both which cauſes are leſs dependent on heat, than the morbid exhalations of the vegetable world, which ſeem to give to our American plague its peculiar charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to be a powerful cauſe of the diſtemper. I am further confirmed in this opinion, by this circumſtance. A diſtinction between the bili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> fevers of our <hi>cities,</hi> and of our <hi>marſhy grounds</hi> on rivers, is obſerved to exiſt, in perfect analogy with the foregoing diſtinction between our bilious plague and the glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dular plague. The mortal fevers, about marſhes in the interior of our country, are leſs infectious, than the peſtilential fevers of
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:036687_0567_100AA5281E5434B8"/>
our cities, altho they are at times as fatal, and are characterized by a yellow ſkin. Theſe ſeem then to proceed <hi>wholly</hi> from veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etable exhalations. The fevers of our cities approach nearer to the plague of the eaſt, becauſe they proceed both from <hi>animal</hi> and <hi>vegetable</hi> exhalations, but the vegetable effluvia have a more predominating influence here, than in countries which are dry or better cultivated. Hence the mortal bilious fevers of our interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or country evidently form a link in the ſeries of gradation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the common remittents, and the yellow fever of our cities; juſt as the yellow fever conſtitutes a grade between our river or lake fevers, and the Levant plague.</p>
                  <p>The order of bilious fevers then ſtands thus in connection with their cauſes:—</p>

                  </list>
                  <p>In this gradation of diſeaſes, there is a regular progreſſion of ſymptoms. Intermittents and remittents exhibit a yellow ſkin, more or leſs, but no infection worth naming—the river or lake plague, a very yellow ſkin, with morbid ſymptoms, but little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection—the bilious plague of cities, ſometimes a yellow ſkin, ſometimes not; and ſome caſes of glandular tumors, carbuncle and petechiae; with more infection—the Levant plague, leſs yellowneſs of the ſkin, and uſually infection and glandular ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Thus, in proportion as the vegetable exhalations predom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:036687_0568_100AA52AC0BB7448"/>
in the ſcale of exciting cauſes, there is more yellowneſs of the ſkin, leſs infection, and leſs frequent affections of the glands—in proportion, as the animal exhalations abound, as the cauſe, the yellowneſs declines, and the affections of the glands multiply, with augmented infection.</p>
                  <p>It is the remark of the celebrated Zimmerman, that "exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from marſhes do not ſeem to be ſo noxious in cold, as in hot countries; yet malignant fevers occur even in Finland. In Germany theſe exhalations produce tertians; in Hungary, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techial fevers; in Italy, hemitritaea; in Egypt and Ethiopia, peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential fevers." On Phyſic, p. 131.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore probable that a greater degree of heat, than the ordinary temperature of Great Britain, is neceſſary to generate the peſtilential fever of our cities. And as no degree of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever yet accumulated on board of a merchantman, can cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a peſtilential atmoſphere, ſufficient to generate an epidemic, the fears of the Engliſh reſpecting ſuch veſſels from the United States or the Weſt-Indies, are utterly groundleſs. The marſh fevers of England, Scotland and of other cool climates, are of an inferior grade. Such are the autumnal fevers near the Fenn's of Lincoln, Ely and Cambridge. In Torbat, in Scotland, a putrid fever ſometimes prevails, and after death, the body turns yellow; this may be aſcribed to certain natural locks or ponds which ſometimes dry up in ſummer.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XVII. Of the means of preventing or mitigating peſtilential diſeaſes.</head>
                  <p>THE firſt ſtep towards an effectual remedy for an evil, is to aſcertain its nature and cauſe, ſo far as they can be underſtood by effects. Primary cauſes are above the reach of man; proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſes, may be ſo far inveſtigated, in moſt things, as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the purpoſes of mankind.</p>
                  <p>It has been proved, in the preceding pages, and every day's obſervation confirms the fact, that one influential cauſe of epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic diſeaſes, muſt exiſt in the elements, independent of all human control. In the production of epidemic catarrh or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enza, for inſtance, no human or artificial means appear to have any ſhare of influence. In the meaſles, artificial cauſes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times modify the ſymptoms, but have no great ſhare in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction or propagation. A ſimilar remark will apply to every ſpecies of angina. The ſmall-pox is alſo modified in its force and ſymptoms by many local circumſtances; and its propagation is chiefly by means of contagion; but this diſeaſe alſo is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, tho rarely, generated in particular bodies without conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The appearance of thoſe diſeaſes in the form of epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics, excepting the ſmall-pox which may ariſe from contagion, always indicates a peſtilential conſtitution of air; and during this conſtitution, ordinary or annual diſeaſes, which depend on ſeaſon or local cauſes, aſſume more violent ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>Autumnal diſeaſes of the annual or ordinary kind, tho ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more violent, fatal and extenſive, by a peſtilential ſtate of air, are however generated by ſubordinate cauſes, moſt of which are within the power of man. The dyſentery depends partly on ſeaſon, partly on ſituation, as to pure air, and partly perhaps on the imperfection of autumnal fruits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sometimes it ariſes in
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:036687_0570_100AA52FB9B99E50"/>
camps from bad diet, or want of ſhelter from the weather; and when it once exiſts, is more or leſs propagated by infection. But this diſeaſe is rendered more malignant, by elemental cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Ordinary bilious fevers of all grades are produced uſually by miaſmata or morbid exhalations from low, damp, marſhy grounds; where vegetables, in the hot ſeaſon, are in a ſtate of rapid pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction. Theſe fevers occur annually, and with a violence of ſymptoms proportioned to the extent and force of the morbid cauſe. The origin and phenomena of all this deſcription of diſeaſes are ſo well known, as to render any obſervations of mine, unneceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The plague, glandular and bilious, ſeems to be nearly allied in its ſymptoms, to the ordinary bilious remittent. The point ſeems not altogether ſettled, whether the contagious yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as it is uſually called, and the common ſporadic yellow fever of the Weſt-Indies, and the bilious remittent, are different grades of one ſpecies of diſeaſe; or whether they are of diſtinct ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>On this point however, the late epidemics have furniſhed our ſcientific men with proofs that appear to me to decide the queſtion, in favor of the identity of the ſpecies. The evidence ariſing from the diſeaſe in Baltimore is alone ſufficient to decide it, as far as it regards the yellow fever and the remitting; and the Acad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy of Medicine in Philadelphia is a moſt reſpectable authority in favor of the ſame doctrin.</p>
                  <p>That the glandular plague of the Levant, and the bilious, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious yellow fever of our country, are ſpecifically the ſame diſeaſe, I have no doubt; but they take ſome different ſymptoms, either from climate, or other cauſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>known. The glandular tumors are held, by moſt writers on the plague, to be the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteriſtics of the diſeaſe, which alone decide its nature, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it from other malignant fevers. But Diemerbroeck and all the beſt authors agree that theſe external ſwellings are not eſſential to the diſeaſe, and that many have the true plague without them. They are however the uſual marks of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>In our bilious peſtilence, theſe ſwellings are leſs common. But, tho rare, they ſometimes appear, in the moſt unequivocal
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:036687_0571_100AA5320D31E248"/>
form of the true peſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. I ſaw an inſtance in 179<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; and they were more common in the laſt epidemic. An inſtance occurred, within my knowledge, in which two auxiliary tumors appeared, and the perſon was never confined by fever.</p>
                  <p>The yellowneſs of the ſkin has given name to the peſtilence of our country; yet this is a misfortune, for it may deceive a common obſerver. A yellow ſkin often accompanies lower grades of bilious fevers, not peſtilential; and is, by no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ans, eſſential to the infectious yellow fever. In all our late epidemics, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have died without exhibiting this color of the ſkin; and it has been leſs common the laſt year, than in former years. It appears then, that the lighter the epidemic diſeaſe, the more common the yellowneſs of the ſkin; and vice verſa. This is no inconſiderable proof of the identity of the bilious and ingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal plague; that in proportion as the bilious plague of our cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate becomes violent and approaches the true plague, it loſes that yellow color of the ſkin, and aſſumes the glandular ſwellings. This I am informed is the fact, as obſerved by the phyſicians in New-York, the ſummer paſt. There are however ſome differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in the ſymptoms of the two ſpecies of plague, which it belongs to the faculty to obſerve and define. It may be that the moiſture of our country, not yet cleared of its woods, and abounding with ſwamps and marſhes, may occaſion the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the ſymptoms. The parts of Europe, Aſia and Africa where the plague moſt uſually prevails, are clear of woods, and cultivated. Perhaps an increaſe of population, and human efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, with a decreaſe of vegetable exhalations in America from cultivation, may in time change the form of our peſtilential fever into the true inguinal plague. I have reaſons for believing ſuch a change actually took place in Rome. Some of the plagues, deſcribed by Livy were obviouſly of the bilious kind, ſimilar to our epidemic fever; but in later periods, the plagues in Rome are expreſsly deſcribed to be, "peſtis inguinaria."</p>
                  <p>However this may be, the cauſes of peſtilence I ſuppoſe to be, firſt ſome eſſential alteration in the primary qualities of air and water, owing to ſeaſons, or to the action of the principle of fire, the main operative agent in the earth and atmoſphere; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:036687_0572_100AA5342798E2F8"/>
is demonſtrated by various epidemics and eſpecially by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh —ſecondly, the ſubordinate cauſes of plague, are, noxious exhalations of every kind, which diminiſh the proportion of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal air imbibed into the lungs. Both cauſes appear to produce diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, either by exceſſive excitement, inducing <hi>indirect</hi> debility; or by reducing excitement, and inducing <hi>direct</hi> debility. The äerial or elemental cauſe ſeems to produce exceſſive excitement; for its firſt effect appears in catarrh, a diſeaſe of ſtenic or inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis. Thus the preſent epidemic conſtitution was preceded by influenza, of univerſal prevalence and of ſevere ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>
                  <p>Meaſles, another diſeaſe that rarely fails to characterize the early ſtages of a peſtilential conſtitution, is alſo of an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diatheſis. The ſame is true of the common diſtinct ſmall-pox —another diſeaſe, which, before the art of inoculation, ſeldom failed to rage in cities, during ſuch a conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Anginas are of different types; ſome of the milder kinds are ranged by Brown amomg ſtenic diſeaſes; but the angina maligna he conſiders as aſtenic. Diſeaſes of this claſs however form a part of the effects of a peſtilential conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Next to this ſpecies of diſeaſes, may be arranged the petechial fevers, which under the names of purple, or ſpotted, have often overſpread Europe, and rarely fail to precede the plague. Theſe are the product of the laſt ſtages of a peſtilential conſtitution, next to the true plague, which marks the criſis. Theſe forms of malignant fever have never occurred in America, as epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics; but purple and livid ſpots, vibices and all the variety of eruptions, which belong to that claſs of diſeaſes, occur occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally during peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>It is a remarkable fact, and one that ſeems to have eſcaped ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that a peſtilential conſtitution of air in all ages and countries, produces epidemic diſorders of the <hi>eruptive</hi> kind. I queſtion whether in a ſingle inſtance, ſince the days of Moſes, the real plague, ever became epidemic, without one, two or all of that kind of diſeaſes for its precurſors. We cannot look into an author, who has deſcribed the diſeaſes which prevail in ſuch
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:036687_0573_100AA53864D060A0"/>
a conſtitution, from Hippocrates down to our time, but we ſee ignes ſacri, variolae, morbilli or other <hi>eruptive</hi> diſorders, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting a part of the deſcription. Theſe diſeaſes ſeem evidently to be claſſed by the laws of nature, and always to appear, in cloſe connection.</p>
                  <p>Hence the propriety of Sydenham's obſervation, p. 120 that "the eryſipelas, ignis ſacer, is a good deal like the plague, and ſometimes accompanied with pains in the glands—that it begins much in the ſame manner as the plague, but the plague is much more violent than an eryſipelas."</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo we obſerve that Hippocrates, in deſcribing a peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilential conſtitution, mentions that before ſpring appeared "eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipélata polla," many caſes of the eryſipelas, of a bad type, and mortal.</p>
                  <bibl>De morb. Vulgar. Sec. 2.</bibl>
                  <p>This is a curious phenomenon and worthy of inveſtigation, that a particular conſtitution of the atmoſphere, ſhould, in its different ſtages or in different ſeaſons of the year, tend to generate all thoſe diſeaſes, which throw out upon the ſurface of the body, petechiae, vibices, a general effloreſcence and tumors, with various other appearances. It belongs to medical men to explain the general proximate cauſe, which, while its effects are various, ſtill gives to diſeaſes ſome common ſimilitude.</p>
                  <p>In America, a peſtilential conſtitution exhibits the ſame phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, as meaſles, and anginas, but without the purple or ſpotted fever, as the precurſor of our peſtilence. The immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate precurſors of the bilious plague in America, are catarrhous affections, diſorders of the throat, and eſpecially bilious fevers of a bad type, ending often in black vomit. Detached caſes of this latter diſeaſe rarely or never fail to introduce or p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>cede the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious epidemic.</p>
                  <p>But no diſeaſe whatever ſeems more cloſely connected with peſtilence than catarrh. An epidemic influenza, is almoſt inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably the ſignal of the approach of a peſtilential conſtitution; and during the whole exiſtence of the conſtitution, catarrhous affections are frequent in particular ſeaſons, and eſpecially juſt before or after the prevalence of a peſtilential fever. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance affords no inconſiderable evidence, that what we call
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:036687_0574_100AA5363022EBF8"/>
an epidemic conſtitution acts upon the human body as a violent ſtimulus. The firſt diſeaſes excited by it are uſually of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory diatheſis as catarrh and meaſles. Hence perhaps we derive a clue to explain the myſtery of the peſtilential diſeaſes which ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>The continued effect of exceſſive ſtimulus, muſt be debility. The epidemic conſtitution, when it firſt commences, is mild, and produces ſtenic diſeaſes, not very mortal, as catarrh and meaſles; for a very obvious reaſon, the force of the ſtimulus is not at firſt ſufficient to haſten on the indirect debility of the ſyſtem, or to produce the aſtenic diatheſis in a fatal degree. But as this ſtate of air advances in ſtrength, the ſtimulus is greater; and when aided by the heat of ſummer, produces a degree of excitement, that ſpeedily induces univerſal debility. Hence the peſtilential fevers of ſummer and autumn ſeem to be the effect of exceſſive ſtimulus, acting upon the ſyſtem with ſuch violence, as to produce ſpeedy debility, in conſequence of which, all the functions of the ſyſtem are weakened and deranged—the ſtomach does not digeſt food—the periſtaltic motion is imperfect and feeble—the liver and the gall-bladder do not perform their ſecretions—the energy of the brain is diminiſhed—the extreme veſſels are relaxed. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is, that part of aliment which ought to be ſeparated and carried off by the inteſtines, as the hepatic fluid, is retained, and forced out of its proper ducts, into other parts of the ſyſtem, where it excites external eruptions, effloreſcence, or yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; in every part of the body, becoming rank poiſon, and ſpeedily inducing fever, morbid affections, and diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>This proceſs is infinitely modified by ſubordinate cauſes; as ſeaſons, which are extremely various; local exhalations and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant air, which are deleterious according to their force; the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous modes of living, which ſtrengthen or weaken the human body; and accidental circumſtances, as fatigue, grief, fear, expoſure to exceſſive heat, or ſudden cold; and innumerable ſimilar cauſes.</p>
                  <p>This idea of the proximate cauſe of the bilious plague of our climate was imbibed from obſervation and converſation with phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, before I had read Brown's Elements of Medicin. I am happy enough to find, on reading that work, a confirmation of
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:036687_0575_100AA53A009A6370"/>
the opinion. That author obſerves, paragraph 137. "Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſecretory veſſels ſeemed crammed with a colluvies of fluids, capable of producing indirect debility, as in that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing of bile, which diſtinguiſhes the yellow fever of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid zone."</p>
                  <p>This "colluvies of fluids," lodged in the ſecretory veſſels, ſeems to act like poiſon, in diſorganizing the ſyſtem. And the reaſon why the plague is ſo often incurable, ſeems to be the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and the imperceptibility of the action of that poiſon, which appears totally to undermine the vital powers, before it exhibits much pain or fever. This is not its common mode of operation; but it is not unfrequent. Caſes of this kind are ſoon characterized by a total proſtration of ſtrength, a cadaverous look, and a dull, glaſſy, languid eye, ſo often deſcribed by med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical writers. In ſuch caſes, debilitating remedies precipitate death; and ſtimulants are ineffectual to revive the languid func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>In moſt caſes however the approaches of the diſeaſe are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with pains, uneaſineſs, and febrile ſymptoms, while the ſyſtem yet retains its ſtenic diatheſis; in ſome ſuch caſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitating remedies are uſeful; but the rapidity of the progreſs of the poiſon ſoon changes the diatheſis to aſtenic.</p>
                  <p>Boyle remarks vol. 1. 672, "that a day or two before the plague has manifeſted itſelf, in ſome perſons, their viſion has been affected; objects appearing diverſified with beautiful colors. A vomit adminiſtered to ſuch, uſually gave relief." Every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſuch eminent men deſerves conſideration; but I do not remember to have found the ſame in any other author. If juſt, is it not an evidence that the ſtate of air, inducing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, operates <hi>firſt as a ſtimulus?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Procopius has recorded of the plague of 543, a phenomenon ſomewhat ſimilar to that noticed by Boyle. He ſays, perſons imagined they ſaw phantoms or ghoſts, which made them ſuppoſe they were ſmitten by ſome perſon. Such as had this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſoon periſhed with the plague.</p>
                  <p>In 746 alſo perſons were troubled with phantaſtical images which filled them with terror. See alſo the plague in Carthage before Chriſt 404.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="unknown:036687_0576_100B2C4ED90CF6C0"/>General appearances favor the idea, that what is uſually called an epidemic ſtate of air, produces, in the human ſyſtem, unuſual excitement by exceſſive ſtimulus. But then how ſhall we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the angina maligna, a diſeaſe of extreme aſtenic di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis, which often forms one of the ſeries of epidemics, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſame conſtitution? Is this alſo the effect of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive excitement, inducing great debility? Is not its prevalence principally among children of ſound health, a proof that it is the conſequence of indirect debility?</p>
                  <p>However theſe queſtions may be decided, certain it is that under the ſame conſtitution, and during the ſame peſtilence, the fatal diſeaſes aſſume very different ſymptoms, and exhibit, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent bodies, a different diatheſis. In all epidemics of this ſort, a principal object of the phyſician is to aſcertain the general di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis produced by the conſtitution of air, and the various ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it in different bodies.

                  <p>The ſecondary or auxiliary cauſes of plague, coming under the denomination of <hi>impure air,</hi> are ſuppoſed to act upon the ſyſtem, by directly debilitating powers. "It cannot be doubted, ſays Brown, 145, that the application of air, to the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the body is a neceſſary ſtimulus. The air is ſeldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in a pure ſtate; it is commonly blended with <hi>foreign mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that diminiſh its ſtimulating power,</hi> and tho its ſalutary ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulus depends upon its purity, it is uncertain whether ever its pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity goes ſo far as to ſtimulate in exceſs and thereby produce ſtenic diatheſis." I know not what this author would call "purity of air," but I am very certain that an epidemic influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enza procee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> from ſome qualities in the atmoſphere, and this author agrees the diſeaſe to be of ſtenic diatheſis. If the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is the effect of "foreign matter," infuſed into the air, then this foreign matter is of a ſtimulating quality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="unknown:036687_0577_100AA53BB078D428"/>I ſuſpect however that the atmoſphere ſhould be conſidered as compoſed of two principal ſubſtances, <hi>air</hi> and <hi>fire,</hi> or <hi>electricity.</hi> Morbid matter floats in the <hi>air,</hi> but the principal ſtimulating power probably conſiſts in the <hi>electricity</hi> of the atmoſphere.</p>
                  <p>The influence of morbid exhalations from putrefying ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is, probably to diminiſh the ſtimulant power of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, inducing direct debility. The lungs receive, at every breath, a certain quantity of air; that is, about the ſame cubic quantity. A certain portion of this, is vital air, oxygen, which ſerves as food for the lungs and blood, and which is ſeparated from the reſt and abſorbed. Whenever therefore common air is impregnated with an undue proportion of hydrogene, or with any ſpecies of acid, which is hoſtile to the lungs, theſe viſcera want their proportion of food, or ſtimulus; the conſequence is, their action is weakened, and the heart and arteries want their due force; the effect of which is a more feeble circulation of blood. Perhaps alſo the ſeptic acid, conveyed to the blood with common air, at every inſpiration, gradually deſtroys its texture.</p>
                  <p>Sorbait mentions that a lighted candle being placed near per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons dying with the plague, a livid vapor has been ſeen, iſſuing from their mouths. Extremely vitiated muſt be the air from the lungs, before it can be rendered inflammable.</p>
                  <p>But whatever may be the proceſs, we know the effects of reſpiration in air vitiated by morbid exhalations, to be fevers of various kinds, as intermitting, remitting, dyſenteric, and putrid or peſtilential. That ſtate of the atmoſphere which I call <hi>peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential,</hi> has a ſingular effect in increaſing the irritability of the nervous ſyſtem, by which means ſlighter cauſes than uſual occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion dangerous inflammation.</p>
                  <p>Having then arrived at the probable cauſes of the peſtilential fevers which afflict the earth, we are prepared to conſider the means of prevention.</p>
                  <p>The firſt article under this head, is, the removal of all local cauſes of diſeaſe; ſuch as every ſpecies of putreſcible ſubſtances, which, in the proceſs of putrefaction, emit a ſpecies of air highly unfriendly to health. It will be obſerved that I ſpeak of
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:036687_0578_100AA53FDD9E7D30"/>
                     <hi>putreſcible</hi> ſubſtances; for fleſh or vegetables, which have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the proceſs of putrefaction, or of digeſtion in a healthy ſtomach, diſcharge little or none of the pernicious acid.</p>
                  <p>Hence we obſerve that people in cities rely too much on clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſtreets to preſerve public health. Experience proves that the utmoſt care in cleanſing ſtreets will not always prevent peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The reaſon is obvious; moſt of the filth of ſtreets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of excrementitious matter from horſes or oxen, which has undergone the proceſs mentioned, and contains no ſeptic acid, or very little. Hence the accumulation of dung in the farmer's yard, is not known to generate diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Various other ſubſtances, thrown into the ſtreets of cities, are more pernicious; as green vegetables, the garbage of fiſh, lees of fermenting liquors, and many others, which, in hot weather, ſoon putrefy and diſcharge noxious air. Such ſubſtances how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever never ought to be thrown into the ſtreet in hot weather; they ſhould be thrown into the ocean, into rivers of running water, or what is better ſtill, <hi>buried,</hi> and that before putrefaction begins. If putrefaction is began, they ſhould be removed in covered veſſels.</p>
                  <p>The vaults of cloacina, altho they contain moſtly ſubſtances, which have paſſed through digeſtion, and in their unmixed ſtate, are not <hi>very</hi> pernicious, yet they are always mixed with other ſubſtances, which, in hot weather, bring on fermentation. Theſe ſhould be either cleanſed annually in ſpring, or the matter in them neutralized by quick-lime.</p>
                  <p>All filthy ſubſtances ſhould be removed from ſtreets, both for the ſake of decency and of health. If the pavements of ſtreets could be covered with pure earth, it would greatly leſſen the heat; but this is not practicable. The only effectual remedy, is freſh running water—the only article that unites cleanlineſs with coolneſs. Nothing, in a city, can be an adequate ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; for while it removes the cauſes of noxious vapors, and by cooling the ſultry air of a city, prevents debility, it extricates a conſiderable quantity of new and wholeſome air, from its own ſubſtance, and abſorbs pernicious vapors.</p>
                  <p>Streets ſhould alſo be ſo conſtructed as to give the water a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:036687_0579_100AA54224D3D370"/>
velocity. The practice of levelling the ſurface of a city, is moſt pernicious. If poſſible, every ſtreet in a city ſhould have a deſcent of fifteen or twenty degrees. Inſtead of levelling the earth, the police of a city ſhould counteract even a natural level, by throwing the whole into artificial elevations; which give a briſker currency both to water and air.</p>
                  <p>Cellars ſhould be ſo conſtructed, as to retain no water; and often cleanſed by ſcraping. If the ſurface of the cellar can be conveniently changed, by removing a few inches of the old carth and introducing that which is freſh, it would be a very ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utary labor. Nothing imbibes and neutralizes infectious matter, more readily than freſh earth.</p>
                  <p>The liberal uſe of water, in and about a houſe, cannot be too ſeriouſly recommended. Water abſorbs all noxious matter that comes in contact with it in ſubſtance. Applied to floors, wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſtone or brick walls, to clothes, to furniture, to back-yards and ſtreets; it is every where ſalutary in the ſummer months. Dr. Prieſtly obſerves, that water purifies vitiated air, by abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeptic part. Hence its great utility as a preſervative againſt peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>All dead animals in a city or its vicinity, ſhould be buried or burnt; as cats, dogs and horſes. The indecency alone of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering their carcaſes to putrefy before the eyes of mankind, ought to make it a ſtrict article of police, to remove them. But they ſhould be buried; not one ſhould be permitted to offend the eyes or noſtrils of a citizen.<note n="*" place="bottom">From two years obſervations, made as I paſſed daily from New-York to my reſidence in the country, I judge from twenty to thirty worn-out cart-horſes die and putrefy in the ſuburbs of that city, every year.</note> They are offenſive to decency, to moral ſentiments and to health. The ancient method of burning dead bodies was well calculated to deſtroy the poiſon; but in Atlantic America, burial is cheaper and equally effectual.</p>
                  <p>Common ſewers are often common nuiſances. In cities, all filthy ſubſtances ſhould be conveyed off, on the viſible ſurface of the earth, unleſs ſewers can be ſo conſtructed as to depoſit, with certainty, all their contents in running water. Serious evils ariſe from putrid ſubſtances lodged in ſewers, that are too level, and
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:036687_0580_100AA543DF48E170"/>
which ſerve as reſervoirs inſtead of canals, accumulating putreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible matters, in places where their exhalations, by the influence of moiſture, are doubled, inſtead of being removed.</p>
                  <p>In cities, where all filth is naturally caſt by rains into the docks, it would be well that all wharves ſhould be ſo conſtructed, as to preſent a ſmooth uniform front to the ſtream, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended into deep water. Mud, waſhed by the ſalt tides, and not mixed with putreſcible matters, produces no inconvenience to health; but ſuch matters, thrown into docks, bare at low water, and expoſed to a hot ſun, diſſolve moſt rapidly, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate morbid vapors. Many improvements are yet to be made in our ſea-ports, which will leſſen the accumulation of perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious air.</p>
                  <p>A great and moſt deſirable article in a ſyſtem for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health, is, the purifying of rooms from air which has been reſpired for a length of time. By experiment it is found that the air of rooms that have been ſlept in, is very inſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious; and probably more ſo, than the air of privies, which is found to contain leſs noxious air than was formerly ſuppoſed. See Encyclopedia, art. Atmoſphere. Indeed, it is queſtionable whether there is any <hi>neceſſary</hi> connection between offenſive ſmells and inſalubrity. Nature has kindly provided that dead feces ſhould not be very pernicious to health; but the effluvia of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fermenting bodies are to be avoided as rank poiſon. In this reſpect cleanlineſs is made eſſential to health.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible in a work of this kind to enter upon the details of cleanſing a great commercial city. The magiſtrates, aided by medical men, in every city, will attend to the minute regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for preſerving a pure air.</p>
                  <p>But there are other cauſes of autumnal diſeaſes, which muſt not be overlooked.</p>
                  <p>It is remarked by writers that the diſeaſes from marſhes and ſtagnant waters are moſt violent near their ſources; and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abate in their violence and become leſs common, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from thoſe ſources. See Buel on the marſh fevers at Shef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. Medical Repoſ. vol. 1. 457. Hence, in a country gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally mountainous or hilly, dry and ſalubrious, but containing
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:036687_0581_100AA54654327C88"/>
here and there a pond of dead water or marſh, the bilious fevers generated by the effluvia, will be local, rarely extending beyond one mile and a half from their ſource.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome extenſive marſhes, which may produce ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to a much greater diſtance. Such are the low grounds in Hungary, a ſickly region; the pontine marſhes near Naples, which may affect the health of people in Rome; the flat lands and rice plantations in Bengal on the Ganges—the coaſt of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Firma in South-America, and the marſhes from E. Florida to the Delaware in North America. The fevers of Cambridge, Ely and Lincolnſhire in England, may be claſſed with thoſe above mentioned; but are of ſmaller extent.</p>
                  <p>It is an opinion in Conſtantinople that the frequency of the plague in that city, is to be attributed to the northerly winds, which come from the marſhes of Tartary and Ruſſia, bordering on the Euxine, ſweeping that ſea, and conveying moiſture and noxious exhalations.</p>
                  <p>The poſition of that city is otherwiſe a very healthy one—the climate is temperate—the ſite of the city, high, dry and riſing into hills and mountains on the weſt. No cauſe of unuſual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes can be found in the neighborhood. The cauſes within the city, are powerful. Many of the ſtreets are narrow, filthy, crou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and almoſt obſtructed by pent-houſes. But in this reſpect, Conſtantinople is not worſe than one half the cities of Europe. Shall we then admit that winds will convey morbid exhalations, ſeveral hundred miles, without diſſipating them, ſo as to render them innoxious? Let us attend to other facts.</p>
                  <p>No city in Europe, except Conſtantinople, has been more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently deſolated by plagues, than Rome, from the time of Rom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulus to the cloſe of the laſt century. Shall we aſcribe this, to the vaſt marſhes which border the ſhore from the mouths of the Tiber to Naples? Certain it is, that Rome has ever been conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, as a very unhealthy city; and the terrible plagues which ravaged it, when in the utmoſt proſperity, as well as in modern times, juſtify this opinion. So ſenſible have the inhabitants been of the prevalence of this opinion abroad, and the ill-effects of it in preventing ſtrangers from reſorting to the city, that Lanciſius,
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:036687_0582_100AA5496134B3B0"/>
an eminent phyſician of the preſent century, wrote a conſiderable treatiſe, evidently with a view to remove this opinion.</p>
                  <p>This author obſerves, that ſouth winds at Rome, if violent, humid, with clouds and heat, produce inconvenience, and if they paſs over marſh, they may bring "particulas lethiferas," ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pernicious vapors, which produce peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>The Romans very early took meaſures to correct the evils to which the city was expoſed. The enormous cloacae, or ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were raiſed at a vaſt expenſe, to carry off all ſtagnant water, and dry the ſoil, and while kept clean, were very uſeful. Hence cloacina was deified as the goddeſs of health. Theſe ſewers were under the care of certain officers, called "Curatores Cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum Urbis." In one inſtance, theſe drains had been a long time neglected, and were cleanſed at the expenſe of a thouſand talents. Severe laws were enacted, prohibiting individuals, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der penalty of a fine, to ſuffer water to ſtagnate.</p>
                  <p>Lanciſius aſcribes the ſevere diſeaſes which afflicted Rome, in the decline of the Empire, to the deſtruction of the aqueducts and neglect of the ſewers. In 1695, when the ditch of Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's tower, and the great ſewer of the city Leoninae, were filled with filth, immediately on the blowing of the ſouth wind, began peſtilential diſeaſes. By order of the Pope, at this author's ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, the ſtreets, vaults, ditches and all ſimilar places, were thoroughly cleanſed, and ten years after, no epidemic malignant diſeaſe had appeared. He however obſerves that when a ſouth wind blows for <hi>a long time,</hi> acute fevers, tertians, pains in the head, and vertigo become epidemic. This muſt be occaſioned by the debilitating effects of that wind, or by miaſmata convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a diſtance, probably from the pontine marſhes.</p>

                  <p>Egypt is a flat country, containing not much marſh, but annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overflowed, and ſubject to moſt of the inconveniences of marſhy countries, from the drying of its moiſt ſurface, in very hot weather. Here again we have a nurſery of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>The banks of the Euphrates and Tigris are nearly in the ſame predicament, and Baſſora, is in Perſia, what Cairo, is in Egypt.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the coaſt of South America, from Carthagena to the Oronoke, is bordered with marſh, and is every where ſickly.</p>

The low ſwampy lands that border all the rivers, in the flat country of Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas, and the immenſe tract of bog in Virginia called the <hi>diſmal?</hi> The effects of them on the neighboring inhabitants are well known—annual and almoſt univerſal intermittents, and often, remittents.</p>
                  <p>Is it not poſſible and probable, that the noxious exhalations from theſe vaſt hot-beds of putrefaction, are borne on the ſouth-weſterly winds, which prevail almoſt conſtantly in June, July and Auguſt, and which run parallel with the general trending of the coaſt, from Florida to New-York? Do they not impregnate the whole atmoſphere for a conſiderable breadth, and ſweep the country, from the eaſtern ſhore of the Cheſapeek to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, New-Jerſey, and in a ſlighter degree, to New-York? I do not give a poſitive opinion on this ſubject; but the annual prevalence of flight intermittents on York-Iſland, and in the city, tho far removed from any marſh, and continually ventilated by ſea breezes, as well as waſhed by rapid tides, affords ſome ground to believe this ſuggeſtion.</p>
                  <p>It is confirmatory of this idea, that ſoon after leaving York-Iſland towards the eaſt, all intermittents diſappear; unleſs in a very few places, where they proceed from obvious local cauſes: Now it muſt be obſerved, that the coaſt of the United States, runs generally from ſouth-weſt to north-eaſt; but at New-York, it takes a different courſe, and runs about eaſt by north, for two hundred miles. This courſe ſoon carries the people on the ſhore, beyond the reach of the ſuppoſed ſtream of morbid vapor, from the ſouthern marſhes, whoſe courſe is with the ſouth weſterly winds.</p>
                  <p>I am not attached to this idea; but it is in conformity with the opinion of the inſalubrity of the Euxine winds at Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople; and with the effects of the ſoutherly Calabrian wind, blowing over the pontine marſhes, towards Rome. Lanciſius relates a remarkable fact. Thirty gentlemen and ladies went on a party of pleaſure, towards the mouth of the Tiber. The wind ſhifted ſuddenly, and blew from the marſhes, "paludes oſtienſes," and twenty-nine of them were immediately ſeized with a tertian. If ſuch was the effect of the vapors from thoſe
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:036687_0584_100AA54D12A744C0"/>
marſhes, we may ſuppoſe the vaſt pontine marſh would poiſon the air to a much greater diſtance.</p>
                  <p>That the extenſive moraſſes, along our ſouthern ſhore, are pregnant with miſchief to that country is certain; that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Philadelphia and New-York are affected by them, may be poſſible. It would therefore deſerve conſideration, whether the evil will admit of a remedy. There are two modes of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering marſhy lands and ſtagnating water ſalub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s—one, by draining the lands and cultivating them; the other by turning into them ſtreams of running water. It is probable that moſt of the marſh at the ſouthward, being within reach of tides, and below high water, is incapable of being drained. It is the pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine region of North-America. How far the ſecond plan can be applied with ſucceſs, I have not the local knowledge of the land and rivers to determin. The claſſic reader will recollect the inſtance, related in hiſtory of Empedocles, the Sicilian phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher and poet, who put an end to peſtilential diſeaſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saliuntii, by turning two ſtreams of good water into the marſhes, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om which they originated.</p>
                  <p>If there is a poſſibility of drying any of the lands, now cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with poiſon, or of putting the dead water into motion, the United States have a vaſt intereſt in effecting that object; and expenſes are not to be put in competition with the health and lives of our citizens.</p>
                  <p>The ſame remark is applicable to all the marſhes in other parts of the country, as about ſome of the lakes; and to all ſmaller ſources of diſeaſe, ſwamps and ponds. In every poſſible ſituation, where ſtagnant water contains vegetable ſubſtances in abundance, diſeaſes muſt prevail. Running water, on the other hand, is ſalubrious. It not only does not exhale morbid air, but it generates freſh and pure air; at the ſame time, it creates a gentle breeze by its current, which helps to diſſipate any nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious particles in its neighborhood which may ariſe from other ſources.</p>
                  <p>People in the country cannot be too careful in ſelecting a ſpot for their habitation. The queſtion, of continued health or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, of long life or premature death, hangs very often upon the choice of a ſalubrious ſituation for a houſe.</p>

                     <pb n="230" facs="unknown:036687_0585_100AA54FC5826298"/>A farmer ſhould never plant his dwelling by the ſide of a marſh. Whatever may be the ſituation of his lands, he is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable, if he builds his manſion within a mile of the ſources of diſeaſe and death. Better for him to go a mile and a half to his daily labor, enjoying robuſt health, than to live within the circulation of poiſonous vapors, afflicted by diſeaſes for three months in the year. And when a farmer has the misfortune to be obliged to labor occaſionally in the vicinity of ſtagnant water, he ſhould be careful not to enter upon the ground early in the morning, before the noxious vapors have been raiſed and attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the heat of the ſun, nor ſhould he continue there, till late in the evening.</p>
                  <p>People in the country ſhould ſelect hilly or elevated poſitions for their houſes; where the ſurface of the earth is dry, and there is a free circulation of pure air. There is another reaſon —the water on high grounds is always better than in low, ſwampy places. Water in flat lands ſtagnates beneath the ſurface, as well as above; but on hills, it is in conſtant motion. Hence if men expect good water they muſt ſeek for it on mountains, hills and riſing grounds. The Arabians adviſe that houſes ſhould be ſet on high, airy places, near freſh water.</p>
                  <p>When a choice of difficulties occurs, and men are compelled to live near marſh, they ſhould endeavor to place their dwelling on the windward ſide of the marſh, which, in America, is the ſouth and weſt; the ſummer winds being from theſe points. This will often make a prodigious difference in the ſtate of health.</p>
                  <p>The fables of antiquity are moſtly obſcure and not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the moderns; but ſome of them are eaſily explained, and contain moſt excellent leſſons. The ſtory of Python, the huge ſerpent, which alarmed and infeſted the world, until he was ſlain by Apollo, is of this kind. Python was generated by the action of heat on the mud and ſlime, which covered the earth, after the receſs of the water of Ducalion's flood. That is, Python was diſeaſe, proceeding from noxious exhalations, in hot ſeaſons, which was deſtroyed by Apollo, the ſun, which dried and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the earth. See Ovid, Metam. lib. 1. This fable had its origin in Egypt, where Python was killed by Iſis and Orus.</p>

                     </gap>tending to every circumſtance that can aſſiſt in guarding health from the annoyances that are local and viſible, we have a further taſk to perform, to leſſen the effects of that ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principle of diſeaſe, which has been proved to exiſt, in every clime, at certain unequal periods. If, it will be ſaid, ſuch a cauſe of epidemic diſeaſes, does in fact exiſt, and operate on every ſpecies of life, vegetable and animal, this cauſe is above hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man control; all our efforts to avoid its effects, are uſeleſs; and we are doomed by the decrees of heaven, to be the victims of peſtilence, without hope or remedy.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer; that if all hiſtory is not a forgery, the ſtate of the elements, has, in few inſtances, been ſo ill-adapted to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port health and life, or ſo poſitively pernicious, that men have periſhed by millions, in the moſt healthy regions, expoſed to no local cauſes of diſeaſe whate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er, except ſuch as exiſt in the moſt healthy periods. This I muſt believe; but the fact affords no ground of complaint againſt providence; for the ſame fate has attended all other ſpecies of animals. The horſe, the ox, the ſheep, the dog, the cat, the fowls, and the fiſh, are ſubject to the ſame univerſal law of the phyſical world; and on what prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple will man arraign this diſpoſition of all created life, or claim an exemption from the laws, to which all other ſpecies of animals are ſubjected?</p>
                  <p>But we are not altogether without hope, even in the deſperate circumſtances mentioned. If we attend to the cauſes of plagues, we ſhall find they all tend to deſtroy life by <hi>one general ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> which is, <hi>debility.</hi> Either directly or indirectly, all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing cauſes cloſe their operation on the ſyſtem, by inducing <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi> leaving the nerves, muſcles, and inteſtines in a relaxed, languid ſtate.</p>
                  <p>If this principle is juſt, and it is agreeable to the medical idea that debility is the cauſe of all fevers, we have a clue that will lead us to the means of eſcaping the evils of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>In the morbid ſtate of air, producing the uncontrollable peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, which have aſſailed man in the healthieſt ſituations on the
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:036687_0587_100AA554D470F8A0"/>
globe, we obſerve that the moſt terrible effects have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, in ſeaſons, when the air has been warm, humid, une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic, with light ſoutherly breezes; as in the reign of M. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius, of Gallienus, and of Edward III. This ſtate of the air ſerved very much to aid the peſtilential principle, in debilitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the human body. All local cauſes probably tend to the ſame effect.</p>
                  <p>The great deſideratum then is, how to counteract the debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itating operation of theſe cauſes, and <hi>preſerve the tone of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> I am perſuaded that all the means of prevention are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in that idea. No man is taken ill with this furious diſeaſe, until his nervous ſyſtem and his inteſtines ceaſe to perform their uſual functions, and ſecretions are ſuſpended or diminiſhed. Hence perſons, as long as their evacuations are regular, may walk with ſafety in the moſt infected places, until their eyes and their color exhibit the poiſon that is imbibed; yet they will not ſuffer by the diſeaſe, while the veſſels have ſtrength to diſcharge the morbid matter by regular ſecretions and evacuations. This is a known and a common fact.</p>
                  <p>Hence ſome perſons and even phyſicians have reſorted, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the plague, to ſmall doſes of calomel, or other purgative, to keep open bowels. A moſt pernicious practice to thoſe in health, for it induces the very evil meant to be avoided, <hi>debility;</hi> and ultimately, the inteſtines becoming unable to perform their functions, diſeaſe and death enſue. I am well informed of a number of caſes of this kind, in New-York, the laſt ſummer, which ended in death.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>true means</hi> to preſerve the natural tone of the body, are the <hi>moſt natural means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt. Food is the natural ſtimulus of the ſyſtem. During peſtilence therefore this article demands the firſt notice. It is agreed by all writers, and obſervation juſtifies the opinion, that temperance is eſſential to health, during a ſickly ſeaſon. Some perſons, miſtaking temperance for abſtinence, have run into an extreme of abſtinence, which has been fatal to them. The true point to be obſerved, is, to take as much food and drink, as will ſuſtain the body in its uſual degree of ſtrength; without
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:036687_0588_100AA556858B3850"/>
overcharging it with ſtimulus. Too much food produces unuſual excitement, which is followed by indirect debility, a ſtate of body which invites an attack of peſtilence. Too little nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the other hand, induces direct debility, a ſtate equally favorable to diſeaſe. I have good grounds for believing ſome very valuable citizens of New-York, of my acquaintance, fell ſacrifices to their exceſs of caution in the uſe of food, during the laſt epidemic.</p>
                  <p>It is not improbable that different conſtitutions of air, as they produce various ſymptoms in the ſame diſeaſes, may require or admit of very different degrees of ſtimulus, applied to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body. The epidemic in New-York in 1795, like that in Philadelphia in 1793, was characterized with inflammatory di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atheſis, more frequently than in 1798. Hence veneſection, which had acquired great celebrity in 1793, loſt part of its credit, in 1798, and was uſed with more diſcrimination and caution.</p>
                  <p>I ſuſpect the ſame circumſtance has changed or modified the opinion of the great utility of abſtaining from generous diet and liquors. This opinion was general and well received in 1795; nor have any caſes come to my knowledge, in which the practice was ſuppoſed to be injurious. But in 1798, many inſtances oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred where perſons of the moſt ſlender habits, of ſtrict abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from ſtimulating diet, and who weakened the ſyſtem by purges, were ſeized with uncommon violence by the peſtilence, and periſhed. On the contrary, I am acquainted with ſeveral phyſicians, who took their uſual quantity of food, with ſome wine and more than their cuſtomary quantity of porter, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſick, thro the ſeaſon, viſiting the moſt infected places, without ſuffering the leaſt inconvenience to their health.</p>
                  <p>If the point is admitted that debility is the great proximate cauſe of this diſeaſe, which I think cannot be conteſted, the conſequence is plain, that whatever tends to reduce the vigor of the ſyſtem below its uſual ſtandard, muſt be prejudicial, during its prevalence. Hence the propriety of rather increaſing than leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening the uſual quantity of food, or natural ſtimulus; carefully avoiding, at the ſame time, all exceſs in eating or drinking, which is equally dangerous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="234" facs="unknown:036687_0589_100AA5581EE3F198"/>Another thing to be obſerved, in ſummer, and eſpecially in time of peſtilence, is, the guarding the body, but by all means, the head, from the direct rays of the ſun. Nothing is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous than the burning heat of a clear ſun, in ſultry weather. It often produces ſudden death, by means of an apoplexy, inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which are related under the year 1752, to have happened at Charleſton; and the ſame is ſaid to have taken place there, the ſummer paſt. In other caſes, the effect is, what is called a ſtroke of the ſun, "coup du ſoleil," which is not always fatal, but very dangerous.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt general ill-effect of expoſure to a hot ſun, is, great debility, in conſequence of the violent and unnatuaral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement; and this effect is moſt to be found in the nervous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, when the heat has fallen directly on the head. Convaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents from bilious fevers have occaſion to be particularly cautious, not to to expoſe themſelves to a hot ſun; a relapſe is the moſt certain conſequence.</p>
                  <p>The umbrella is an excellent invention; it would be ſtill more excellent, if it could be improved, ſo as to render the ſhade more general, and completely interrupt the rays of the ſun, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being rendered too heavy.</p>
                  <p>In walking the ſtreets of a city, in a clear hot day, the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will naturally ſeek the ſhady ſide. Of ſo much importance is it thought, in ſome hot countries, to ſhield the body from the rays of the ſun, that very diſcerning men contend that narrow ſtreets and high houſes, in cities, contribute to the health of the citizens, by mitigating the heat. They ſuppoſe the obſtruction of air a leſs evil, than a hot ſun. Of this opinion was Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſius.</p>
                  <p>But this is to embrace one evil, in ſhunning another. It is to be regretted that the beſt mode of ſhielding man from a hot ſun, is not adopted in cities. Wide ſtreets, bordered with rows of trees, would be infinitely preferable to all the artificial ſhades that can be invented. Trees are the coolers given to us by nature. They make a pleaſant ſhade—they imbibe the ſeptic fluids, which impregnate the atmoſphere of cities, and poiſon their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants —they exhale pure air—they fan the earth, by creating
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:036687_0590_100AA55AC92EF3C0"/>
or augmenting currents of air, with the vibratory movement of their leaves—they invite the feathered tribe to light on their branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and with the muſic of their notes, to relieve the ear from the grating of rough, unnatural ſounds, which ſtun the citizen.</p>
                  <p>It has been objected to trees, that they increaſe the danger of fire, by obſtructing the free uſe of engines. This objection is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary. Few caſes would occur, where trees, properly placed, could interfere with the operations of extinguiſhing fire; and in ſuch caſes, they might be levelled in a moment.</p>
                  <p>It has alſo been objected, that trees obſtruct the free circulation of air. This is not true. In calm ſummer weather, they very much increaſe a light breeze, by partly obſtructing the upper cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with their branches, and throwing more air below, thus augmenting the under current on the ſurface of the earth, where it is wanted. The leaves and branches alſo, by their gentle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, agitate the air, preventing the ill effects of ſtagnation; and give velocity to the air that finds its way through their interſtices.</p>
                  <p>"The ſtreets and public ſquares of a city, ſays St. Pierre, ſhould be planted with great trees of various ſorts. A city, built of marble, would to me have a melancholy appearance, unleſs I could ſee in it trees and verdure."</p>
                  <bibl>Studies of Nature, 13.</bibl>
                  <p>Trees and all green vegetables diminiſh greatly the heat near the earth; and little do men in general think, how prejudicial to health is the operation of the extreme heat of cities.</p>
                  <p>It is not an uncommon thing in the country, where no miaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata exiſt, for laboring men to over heat themſelves in the field, and die in ſix days, with a bilious fever; their bodies as yellow as ſaffron. This is yellow fever of a mild kind, generated in the ſyſtem, by the debility occaſioned by exceſſive heat and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, without any external cauſe. Thus the extreme heat of Auguſt and September 1798 will alone account for the unuſual violence and extent of the peſtilential fever of that year.</p>

into a ſtate of debility which invites diſeaſe. Not only health, but life, is often ſuſpended on the point of half an hour's exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe. Temperance in labor, bodily or mental, is as eſſential to good health, as in eating or drinking. The muſcles and the nerves, thoſe moving powers of the human body, if ſtimulated beyond a certain point, loſe their excitability beyond the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of recovery.</p>
                  <p>The danger incurred by ſedentary and ſtudious men, during peſtilence, from the debilitating effects of their occupations, is greatly increaſed. Want of due exerciſe is directly relaxing to the ſolids; while application of the mind is apt to over-excite the nerves and induce indirect debility. The extreme irritabil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the nervous ſyſtem, is obvious in a peſtilential ſtate of air. —I experienced it moſt ſenſibly in the ſummer of 1795, during the fever in New-York; and it is evidenced in the vertigo, ſo frequent at ſuch times; in the ſeizure of many perſons in the plague with apoplectic ſymptoms; and in the palſies and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies which are greatly multiplied before or after the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a peſtilence, and which in ſome places, have become almoſt epidemic.</p>
                  <p>During the rage of epidemic peſtilence, alſo the animal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite ſhould be indulged with moderation—exceſſive indulgence, which might have been ſuſtained at other times, has often hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the young and ſprightly, to a premature grave. Nothing can be more dangerous, according to all medical writers on this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Celſus directs that in peſtilence, perſons ſhould ſeek freſh air, travel, ſail; or if theſe are not convenient, they ſhould avoid fatigue, indigeſtion, cold, heat, exceſſive indulgence of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imal deſires; eſpecially ſays the author, in a peſtilence which is occaſioned by ſoutherly winds. Vol. 1. 40, 41.</p>
                  <p>Theſe obſervations are not new; they are common and well known to medical men, and to all others of diſcernment. They are here inſerted, becauſe th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="237" facs="unknown:036687_0592_100AA55F1E541D48"/>But all theſe rules, if ſtrictly obſerved, will not, in a more violent plague, be ſufficient to ſecure the body from attack. Such are the extremely debilitating qualities of the air, in ſome periods, that it will be neceſſary to counteract them by artificial powers poſitively tonic.</p>
                  <p>The application for this purpoſe, which is moſt eaſy and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, is <hi>water;</hi> an article which nature has furniſhed in the greateſt abundance, becauſe it is far the moſt uſeful. On this ſubject perhaps ſome of the following ideas may not be very common.</p>
                  <p>My attention to water, as a preventative of peſtilence, was firſt excited by a paſſage in Volney's Travels in Egypt and Syria, chap. 17. where he informs us in a note that "at Cairo, it is obſerved, the water-carriers, continually wet with the freſh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they carry in ſkins upon their backs, are never ſubject to the plague."—The author is there ſpeaking of the pernicious effects of humidity on health; but the eſcape of the water-carriers, he aſcribes to <hi>lotion,</hi> whoſe effects are different from thoſe of moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by vapor.</p>
                  <p>If this fact is accurately ſtated, it is worth an empire. I am inclined to believe it and to aſcribe the eſcape of thoſe men to the conſtant application of water to their bodies, during the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of the day. Yet if true, why have not authors propagated the knowlege of ſo important a truth, to every part of the world? Is this neglect alſo the fruit of the pernicious errors reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the excluſive origin of the plague from infection? The calamities ſuſtained by mankind, in conſequence of thoſe errors, exceed all calculation.</p>
                  <p>How is it poſſible, that, if a remedy for the calamity of peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence, is ſo obvious and ſo near at hand, the Egyptians ſhould not have applied it univerſally? Can this be aſcribed to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin of predeſtination, which makes them careleſs of the means of prevention?</p>
                  <p>It is very certain that the laws of Moſes, reſpecting the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of blood, fat, ſwine's fleſh, and certain other animals; as alſo the whole ſyſtem of ablutions, purifications, and uſe of perfumes, were intended to correct the evils of the climate; and
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:036687_0593_100AA561E0881830"/>
many of his directions became totally uſeleſs, when the Iſraelites left that country and its vicinity. Heaven never could intend ſome of the proviſions of the Moſaic code, for more temperate and healthy climates.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Egyptians had ſimilar practices, and probably long before the days of Moſes. Their laws and cuſtoms to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure cleanlineſs were very ſtrict, and they involved a moſt liberal uſe of water. Herodotus expreſsly declares that "they ſcour their cups, waſh their linen, and <hi>circumciſe for the ſake of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> The prieſts bathe twice by day and twice by night, and are obliged to wear linen." Swine's fleſh was alſo conſidered to be unclean and prohibited as an article of food.</p>
                  <bibl>See Book 2. Euterpe.</bibl>
                  <p>Theſe regulations doubtleſs proceeded from the experience of their good effects. It is not improbable that the introduction of the Mahometan religion, may have been accompanied with the abolition or diſuſe of ancient practices, which were friendly to health. Certain it is, that the oriental nations make great uſe of baths; the original deſign of which was probably to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt diſeaſes, but which have been abuſed and converted to the purpoſes of luxury.</p>
                  <p>Let us then purſue the idea of applying water as a panoply againſt the attacks of peſtilence. By what means does water guard the body from that diſeaſe?</p>
                  <p>I have already quoted the obſervation of Dr. Prieſtley, to prove that water abſorbs the ſeptic acid. If this opinion is well founded, and I have no doubt of it, we have obtained a moſt eſſential item of knowlege. Freſh water frequently applied to the body receives and carries off all the matter of infection, thus removing <hi>one</hi> copious ſource of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Savary remarks, that peſtiferous matter, paſſed through wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will not communicate the diſtemper. This is a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr. Prieſtley's principles.</p>
                  <p>The ceſſation of the plague in Egypt, on the inundation of the Nile, is no ſmall evidence of the ſame principle. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter changes the ſtate of the air, both by abſorption, that is, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing and carrying off the peſtiferous ſources of vapor from the earth; and by extricating a quantity of freſh air. And this
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:036687_0594_100AA5640F87E420"/>
important fact directs to the mode by which all gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cities are to prevent or leſſen the force of this diſeaſe. What the Nile does once a year for Egypt, freſh ſtreams of water ſhould do every day, in the hot ſeaſon, for all large towns—they <hi>ſhould inundate the ſtreets.</hi> Nature has given, in Egypt, the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and the moſt common nurſery of the plague, the <hi>model</hi> of the beſt remedy for the ſevereſt calamity incident to man; a model which few cities have been wiſe enough to copy.</p>
                  <p>But it will not be ſufficient to truſt wholly to the effect of a diffuſion of water over a city. In the hot ſeaſon, it ſhould be applied to the body very frequently in the way of lotion or bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By this I do not mean to recommend the practice of leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into river or ſea-water, and continuing in it for half an hour —a practice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hich proves fatal to many lives every ſummer. Cold water is the moſt powerfully debilitating application, that can be made to the body. No perſons can bear it, even in ſummer, but the healthy and robuſt; and to ſave ſuch from injury, it muſt not be applied when the body is over-heated, or continued too long. Many—many inſtances occur every year, in which a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal yellow fever is ſpeedily induced by injudicious plunging. An inſtantaneous application of cool water to the body, by a ſingle plunge, or by a ſhower bath, ſometimes acts as a ſtimulant, by a ſudden increaſe of excitability in the ſyſtem; but this ſhould be uſed as a remedy, under the direction of a phyſician. Few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can ſuſtain the ſhock, unleſs in good health; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded it would be as well for mankind, if the uſe of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by plunging, were wholly proſcribed. Judiciouſly applied, it is ſometimes uſeful; but my own obſervations lead me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the utility is more than overbalanced by its fatal or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous effects.</p>
                  <p>The moſt ſafe, eaſy, pleaſant and beneficial mode of uſing water, is, to bathe or waſh the body in a private apartment at home. This may be done in ſeveral ways—either in a large veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel immerſing the whole body at once; or, what is leſs trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, with a ſingle pail or bowl of water, in a bed chamber. The waſhing may be done with the hand, or a ſponge, in a few minutes, as the perſon riſes in the morning or retires, at night.</p>

                     </gap> near that of the blood; a little cooler or a little warmer, and in ſuch a temperature, it is a pleaſant application, occaſioning no violence to the ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>It may not be obvious to every common reader, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of warm water to the ſurface of the body, in a hot day, ſhould cool it. But ſuch is the fact, and nature points out this mode of reducing the heat of the body, by the proceſs of perſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration. In this proceſs, the inſenſible vapor, which eſcapes by the perſpiratory ducts, takes with it a portion of heat—and the more freely a perſon perſpires, the more temperate, the heat of his body. Hence the human body is enabled to ſuſtain heat, ſeveral degrees above that of the blood—and hence the fleſh of a child, in full health perſpiring freely, feels cooler than the air, in a ſummer's day. This phenomenon may be illuſtrated by a thermometer, with the utmoſt eaſe. Immerſe the bulb into warm water, in a hot day. Let the water be of 75 degrees of heat and the air, of 80 degrees. The thermometer, ſtanding at 75 deg. in the water, and taken out into a warmer medium, the air, ought to riſe to 80 deg. but being wet, the evaporation will ſink the mercury four or five degrees; that is to about 70 deg. until the inſtrument is dry, when it will riſe to 80 deg. the temperature of the air.</p>
                  <p>On this principle warm water, as well as cool, will leſſen the heat of the ſyſtem; for no ſooner does a perſon ceaſe to apply the water, than evaporation commences and cools the body by ſeveral degrees. This effect however is temporary, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the ſtimulus of the heat.</p>
                  <p>In very hot weather it is better, eſpecially for <hi>perſons in the vigor of health,</hi> to uſe water a little cooler, than the blood; for the effect of warm water, applied in the manner propoſed, is to ſtimulate—and this is not what the body requires. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when highly excited by the heat of the air, the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a reduction of heat, to prevent over-excitement, and its effect, indirect debility. In general then the body in ſummer is to be cooled by the uſe of water, while in a healthy ſtate; but if debility or diſeaſe has invaded it, it requires heat and excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="unknown:036687_0596_100AA567E543B410"/>Perſons of a <hi>ſlender habit,</hi> who require additional ſtimulus, ſhould uſe water a little warmer than the blood. The effect of cool water applied to perſons in full health, and of warm water, to feeble habits, is the ſame; to <hi>prevent debility; indirect</hi> in the former caſe, and <hi>direct,</hi> in the latter.</p>
                  <p>Bathing a long time in very warm water, to produce profuſe perſpiration, is a powerful laxative; and perhaps it would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if it was never uſed, except as a remedy for diſeaſe, under the direction of phyſicians.</p>
                  <p>The beneficial effects of the uſe of water, in peſtilence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are theſe.—The poiſonous particles compoſing infection, and exhalations of all kinds, are waſhed from the body, and their ill effects prevented—the morbid matter exhaled from the body by the perſpiratory veſſels, is alſo removed—an effect that may be aided by frequent changes of clean linen —The extreme veſſels are ſtimulated and cleanſed, by which means they are enabled to carry on more perfectly the excretions; perſpiration being one of the principal reſources of nature to expel the poiſon which enkindles the flame of peſtilence.—The whole ſyſtem is kept in equilibrio, by a diminution of excitement, in the robuſt, and an increaſe of it, in the debilitated; the conſequence is, the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem is daily renewing its tone and vigor, the energy of the brain is preſerved, the muſcular fibres retain their powers, and all the functions of the body, the digeſtion, circulation, ſecretions, and evacuations, are regularly performed.</p>
                  <p>Medical gentlemen will excuſe me for theſe ideas, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long more properly to their province. They are not new to that deſcription of citizens; but, if juſt, they ought to be univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known; for they lay the beſt foundation for a regular plan of economy, in domeſtic life, which will greatly alleviate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of autumnal epidemics. I cannot help thinking that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are yet in their infancy, in this reſpect; and that in general they underſtand the true art of living, which ſhall ſecure health and happineſs, as little as they underſtood agriculture or naval architecture, in the days of Henry the firſt.</p>
                  <p>I am perſuaded that the whole art of ſecuring ourſelves from
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:036687_0597_100AA56A4508BA10"/>
peſtilence, as I have before remarked, conſiſts in this ſimple maxim—"preſerve the natural energy of the ſyſtem." That water, freſh and pure, is the inſtrument moſt efficacious for this purpoſe, I muſt believe, from reaſon and experiment. The fact related by Volney of the eſcape of the water-carriers, is of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite weight, if fairly ſtated; and demands immediate applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our own caſe. At any rate, it demands inveſtigation.</p>
                  <p>I have other proof of the ſucceſs of water, uſed as I have preſcribed. A friend of mine, who has lived many years in the Weſt-Indies, who has ſeen the yellow fever in all its forms, who has tended the ſick in that climate and in New-York, expoſed himſelf to their breath and effluvia for days and nights ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſlept with his own ſon, when on his death-bed, with that diſeaſe, has hitherto eſcaped the infection. He aſcribes this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity to a daily uſe of water in the manner abovementioned.</p>
                  <p>We are not to calculate on the univerſal and invariable ſucceſs of any remedy for this terrible calamity. Multitudes of men will not take the pains to uſe the means neceſſary to reſiſt the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the numerous cauſes of diſeaſe which ſurround them. They will neither regulate their diet, nor cleanſe their perſons and habitations; and when to the influence of their own intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and the poiſon generated in their houſes and on their bodies, is added the debilitating operation of peculiar ſeaſons and other cauſes which are above human control, great numbers of them muſt ſink and periſh.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it to be ſuppoſed that any human means can, in every caſe, guard life, in a peſtilential ſtate of air. If we admit <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> to be the univerſal proximate cauſe of the plague, we are not ſure that our beſt efforts to obviate its effects will always ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. We may not be able to find or to apply, in all caſes and under all circumſtances, the preciſe degree of ſtimulus, neceſſary to preſerve the corporeal functions; and the variety of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and diverſe operations of the ſame remedies on different bodies, will defeat, in ſome caſes, the moſt exact application of the beſt poſſible ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>Of one thing I am confident, that, in our cities as now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, no rigors of police can ſo effectually cleanſe away the
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:036687_0598_100AA56D2BBFEBB0"/>
ſources of poiſon, as to prevent a return of peſtilence, without the univerſal introduction of a new domeſtic economy, and new modes of living. I am firmly perſuaded that fruitful ſources of the evil lie in theſe two articles—the exceſſive uſe of ſtimulant food and liquors, and the neglect of perſonal waſhing. The diet of the Americans, like that of the Engliſh, is of the moſt nouriſhing kind—a large portion of the beſt fleſh meats, and high-ſeaſoned fiſh and vegetables. Our drink is of the ſame character—the beſt high wines, ſpirits and brandy.</p>
                  <p>In winter, our bodies ſuſtain this ſtimulant mode of living; the extreme cold continually reſiſting its effects by its debilitating powers. But when ſummer arrives, and the violent ſtimulus of heat, is added to the high ſtimulus of the beſt diet, two claſſes of men fall a ſacrifice to violent fevers. Firſt, men who puſh their ſtimulus beyond the powers of nature, by exceſſive exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and imtemperance in eating and drinking—hence a robuſt man riots in debauch to day, and four days after is in his grave. Secondly, men who live freely in winter, and reduce their diet too low in ſummer, to avoid diſeaſes, inducing a weak, languid ſtate of the ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be obvious to any perſon in America, that the French mode of living, in regard to diet, drink, and the liberal uſe of water, protects them from the epidemic diſeaſes which prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Americans, and Britiſh natives. Nor have I the leaſt doubt, that a ſuitable regimen, purſued rigorouſly by the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, would have ſaved one half the people, who periſhed in the black peſtilence in 1348.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunate ſouls! They believed the plague to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by infection only; they ſought ſafety by flight; they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on board of veſſels, and launched out upon the ocean, to <hi>eſcape infection;</hi> but all in vain; the diſeaſe attacked them in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſituation, and the world was almoſt diſpeopled. Had they known that the diſtemper was induced ſolely by the debilitating qualities of the elements and the ſeaſon, what multitudes would have applied the true remedy, and ſurvived! Thanks to a kind providence, ſuch a ſingularly depreſſing ſtate of the air, rarely occurs, but when it does, there is no flight from the ſources of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:036687_0599_100AA56F6EDDB228"/>
as in ordinary plagues, which ariſe in the impure atmoſphere of cities only; but men muſt have recourſe to the applications which reſiſt the effects of debility, and maintain the energy of the ſyſtem by ſupplying the defective powers of the elements, with artificial ſtimuli.</p>
                  <p>I cannot cloſe this ſection, without a few remarks on the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral plan of building large towns.</p>
                  <p>The ancient mode of conſtructing cities bears ſome character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtics of the age and taſte of the nations, in which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively founded. Moſt of the old cities were evidently built with reference to a ſtate of war and robbery; being intended for ſafety, rather than for convenience; as appears by their narrow ſtreets and the projections of the upper ſtories of the houſes. The more people could be crouded into a ſmall ſpace, the leſs military force was neceſſary to defend the town.</p>
                  <p>However this may be, thoſe cities were very ill-conſtructed for the purpoſes of health. Savary aſſerts that 200 perſons in Grand Cairo occupy leſs ſpace than 30 in Paris. The ſtreets are ſo narrow and full of people, that they joſtle againſt each other, and ſometimes a man is obliged to wait ſome minutes, before he can make his way. Letter 3. Yet this ſame author alleges the plague to be <hi>not native</hi> in Egypt! Surely a man of ſcience need not go out of Cairo to look for cauſes of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>Many ſtreets in Conſtantinople are narrow and crouded like thoſe in Cairo.</p>
                  <p>The old city of London, before the <hi>fortunate</hi> conflagration of 1666, was in a like predicament; its ſtreets narrow and almoſt cloſed above by the jutting of the upper ſtories of the houſes. In the old ſtreets, which eſcaped the fire, notwithſtanding all the improvements of modern days, which have mitigated the violence of peſtilential diſeaſes, I am informed people are ſtill infeſted with nervous and typhus fevers. London is however greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the conflagration. In the preſent conſtruction of the buildings, <hi>one</hi> perſon, it is ſaid, occupies as much ground as <hi>two</hi> did before the fire. The ſize and arrangement of houſes and apartments are alſo improved; and better adapted to a free circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of air. The introduction of freſh water may alſo be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:036687_0600_100AA5710E79FE60"/>
among the beſt preſervatives from diſeaſe. Theſe are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the cauſes of the non-appearance of the plague in modern London, and the diminution of the annual bills of mortality, within the laſt half century.</p>
                  <p>The plague however has diſappeared in other cities of Europe, where no ſuch improvements have been made—a curious fact, that will be hereafter conſidered.</p>
                  <p>But the diſeaſe continues to prevail occaſionally in the eaſtern parts of Europe, in Hungary, Poland and Ruſſia, which were ſeverely ravaged in 1770, and 1771. The diſeaſe alſo raged at Oczakow, on the north border of the Euxine as late as the year 1739.</p>
                  <p>That part of Europe abounds with marſhes and ſtagnant wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and conſiſts moſtly of level land. This may account for the continuance of the plague, in that quarter.</p>
                  <p>The United States unfortunately contain ſimilar ſources of diſeaſe, in number and extent ſcarcely equalied. Yet inſtead of profiting by the ſevere diſtreſſes which all great cities have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once in fifteen or twenty years, from peſtilence, and guarding againſt the artificial cauſes of it, our anceſtors began and we are continuing to build cities, on t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We are preciſely in the latitudes moſt favorable to the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of peſtilence. In the tropical climates, conſtant heat ſoon fits the human body to ſuſtain it, and the <hi>natives</hi> of thoſe climates are ſeldom affected by the furious rage of epidemic peſtilential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. Within the tropics <hi>ſtrangers</hi> alone are ſufferers by the climate.<note n="*" place="bottom">Savary remarks "that the plague ſeldom reaches the polar circle and never paſſes the tropics. The caravans of Cairo, Damaſcus and Iſpahan, which are ſometimes infected, never propagate it at Mecea, and Yemen is ſafe from the plague." With few exceptions theſe obſervations are juſt. If the natives of cool regions paſs ſuddenly into tropical cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, they are ſubject to violent fevers; but the reaſon aſſigned in the text is ſufficient to account for the perpetual exemption of <hi>natives</hi> of hot climates from the worſt form of peſtilence. Their bodies mould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the climate—their excitement or debility is always uniform. it is the great changes, in theſe reſpects, which expoſe people in the middle latitudes to the attacks of peſtilential diſeaſes.</note>

                     <pb n="246" facs="unknown:036687_0601_100AA5735207E010"/>But in the temperate latitudes, men are continually ſubject to the alternations of extreme heat and cold—changes hoſtile to the ſyſtem. In winter, we may be ſaid to be inhabitants of Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; in ſummer, of Mexico or the Weſt-Indies. If we do not remove to the polar circles or to the tropics, yet the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſeaſons <hi>bring their climates to us;</hi> and we annually run a ſimilar riſk with the Europeans, who paſs from the northern to the ſouthern latitudes of <hi>periſhing in multitudes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a moſt unqueſtionable fact that the northern ſtates of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica from New-York to Maine, are in a poſition on the globe, as expoſed to the plague as the cities of Marſeilles, Naples, Rome and Conſtantinople; and the ſouthern ſtates have a poſition cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding with the latitude of Syria, the Barbary coaſt and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt; that portion of the earth which is <hi>moſt frequently</hi> ravaged with peſtilential diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>If then we live in a climate in which the human body, from alternate heat and cold, is moſt irritable, and moſt ſubject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant autumnal diſtempers; and if a part of our country is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adapted to the production of ſuch diſeaſes; the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of all queſtions ariſes; what ſhall we do to prevent a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent return of ſuch calamities?</p>
                  <p>To me, the path is extremely plain. Our climate we cannot change—much of our country cannot be raiſed into hills, nor drained of its ſtagnant waters—the laws of nature we are unable to control in the operation.—But <hi>our</hi> duty is plain. Men muſt not plant their habitations near marſhy grounds—the mode of building cities <hi>muſt</hi> be totally changed—and ſo muſt the uſual hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of our citizens.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the whole Atlantic territory, on the low lands, it is more eſſential that large towns ſhould be purpoſely conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for health.—Great cities are uſually founded on commerce, and commerce requires the acceſs of navigable water. Hence ſuch towns are commonly near the ſea ſhore or on the borders of rivers.—But if they are near low marſhy grounds they cannot be
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:036687_0602_100AA5758DE1B218"/>
healthful. High and dry poſitions, with rocky or gravelly earth, are the proper places for populous cities, on account of freſh air and good water.</p>
                  <p>But in any ſitation, our cities are too crouded for health or comfort. Lots are too ſmall—too many people are crouded on to a little ſpace of ground. A family to every lot of 25 or 30 feet by 80 or 100, connot fail to generate too much filth, and to vitiate the air in too great a degree, for the health of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. In every large town in the United States, however re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from marſh, and however healthy its poſition, the effects of crouded population are obvious, every autumn, in the ſickneſs and death of <hi>children.</hi> Multitudes and multitudes of lives are anually ſacrificed, in all cities, to the avarice of the original proprietors of lots. The little narrow dirty houſes, kitchens and yards ſurrounded with high fences, excluding air and veget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; all that can diſſipate or abſorb the noxious exhalations; all that can purify the atmoſphere and refreſh the exhauſted frame of a human being, panting beneath a ſultry ſun—every thing in our cities is contrived to <hi>waſte the powers of life, and ſhorten its duration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men, in this reſpect, are infinitely leſs ſagacious than <hi>irrational</hi> animals. Inſtinct guides the beaſts of the field to the moſt prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er habitations—and they never reſide where they are <hi>annoyed.</hi> But man, with all his boaſted reaſon, ſees the effects of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hundreds and thouſands of his fellow citizens falling vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims to his own neglect, his miſtakes or his ſordid principles; he heaves a ſigh in Auguſt and September, as he views the ſable hearſe, conveying his friends in ſcores to their graves; in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember he ſhrugs his ſhoulders and ſays, <hi>it is all over;</hi> runs to the circus, the theatre and the card room; laughs away the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's evening with his jovial companions, ſome of whom are deſtined, the next ſeaſon, to fall a ſacrifice to the ſame folly and neglect, and to fill new ranges of graves by the ſide of the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims of the preceding year.</p>
                  <p>In the United States, every thing that has been done hitherto in the conſtruction of cities, is in imitation of the old European and African mode, and of courſe is <hi>wrong.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="unknown:036687_0603_100AA5782800E3F8"/>The ancient conſtruction of London coſt that city nearly <hi>two hundred thouſand</hi> lives in one century; and Cairo and Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople probably loſe more than that number, every half century. I firmly believe, and my belief is founded on the uniform ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of eſtabliſhed laws of nature, that a <hi>perſeverence in our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mode of building cities, will doom them all to the ſame fate.</hi> I believe it, becauſe I ſee no poſſible reaſon why peſtilential diſeaſes ſhould not be as frequent and as fatal in America as in the old world, under the operation of ſimilar local cauſes.</p>
                  <p>If a rigid police can be uniformly obſerved; and every poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nuiſance be removed by ſhovels, brooms and water, cities in healthy poſitions, will eſcape the regular and conſtant return of malignant epidemics.—Multitudes of lives may be ſaved, and the loſs of buſineſs prevented, by theſe means; and in cities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready built, cleanſing, waſhing and purifying, are the guardian angels of public health.</p>
                  <p>But I maintain that this is not exterminating the root of the evil. Cities <hi>may</hi> be built ſo as to unite all the utility of a town, with the ſalubrity and pleaſures of the country, and in this new world, where men are as free to act as to think, it will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable not to invent and execute a plan for theſe purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>Were I called upon for a plan of a city, which ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine in it the advantages of town and country, I ſhould ſuggeſt the following as the outline:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The poſition to be on the ſhore of the ſea or the bank of a river, gently aſcending with an angle of at leaſt fifteen or twenty degrees; which would form a declivity for a rapid deſcent of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to waſh the city; at the ſame time, would not prevent the draft of heavy loads from the river or ocean.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The wharves on the water ſhould be extended beyond low water mark, that no part of the docks ſhould be left bare by the receſs of the tide. All the ſolid front of the wharves ſhould be on a line; that no eddies might be formed; and the water might flow in a paſſing current. This would carry off ſubſtances thrown into the water, and contribute to keep the air pure by motion and change. Should it be neceſſary to extend wharfing in one place further than in another, it ſhould be in the form of a bridge on piers.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="249" facs="unknown:036687_0604_100AA579D1A797A0"/>3. The warehouſes on the wharves ſhould not be jumbled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a chaos; one projecting in front of another; but built in a ſtrait range, at a ſuitable diſtance from the water; and an alley ſhould paſs between them for the admiſſion of freſh air on every ſide. No wet cellars ſhould be permitted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſtreets ſhould be ſtrait, interſecting each other at right angles, and forming the city into ſquares of at leaſt 500 feet on a ſide.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The lots ſhould be at leaſt 60 feet wide, and 250 feet long. No more than 35 or at moſt 40 feet of the breadth of the lot to be ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er covered with buildings, ſo that a ſpace of 20 or 25 feet ſhould intervene between the houſes. This ſpace would leave a cartway, give free admiſſion to air, and reduce the riſk of fire 75 per cent.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the rear of the front building, out houſes might cover 100 feet of the length of the lot. The remaining 150 feet ſhould be laid out to the fancy of the owner in a garden—the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice interfering no farther than to require by law that ſome kind of trees or vegetables ſhould occupy the ſpace—vegetation being the natural purifier of the air.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Directly thro the center of each ſquare, ſhould run a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtreet of about 25 feet taken out of the rear of the lots, which ſtreet or alley ſhould never be built on, but would admit a paſſage for citizens thro the ſquares; and what would be ſtill more neceſſary and uſeful, would admit duſt-carts to take up all the filth of the houſes, from the rear, and prevent that intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nuiſance, the depoſiting of offenſive materials in the ſtreets. The little flower gardens and ſhady lawns in theſe ſquares, would preſerve the air pure, freſh and cool in ſummer—they would oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy many perſons of delicate health, thus contributing to their comfort, diverting their minds, and in many caſes, reſtoring them to health. Here alſo children would find room to gambol, without endangering their lives or annoying paſſengers in the ſtreets; and here the young of both ſexes would acquire a taſte for gardening, for botany, and the delightful amuſement of ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the works of nature.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The ſtreets ſhould be one hundred feet in breadth, and
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:036687_0605_100AA57B57899E98"/>
planted with three rows of trees. One row on each ſide next the foot walks, and a row in the center. The foot walks to be 15 feet wide. The trees next the walks would then be 15 feet from the houſes; and a ſpace between the center row and each ſide row, of 35 feet. The trees might be ſo pruned, as to prevent their injuring the buildings, and their diſtance would prevent their interfering with fire engines. Theſe trees would be leafleſs in winter, when the ſun is acceptable; and in ſummer would ſweeten, purify and cool the air. The citizens at all times in the day, would walk in a refreſhing ſhade—the center row of trees would furniſh ſhade for horſes.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. No city ſhould be raiſed on level earth. If a natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition cannot be found, with a general declivity to the water, the ſtreets ſhould be thrown into artificial elevations of at leaſt 3 feet in every hundred—five feet in the hundred would be better. This would give celerity to the water falling in ſhowers, and wonderfully aſſiſt in removing filthy ſubſtances from the ſtreets; for after all human efforts in ſweeping, much offenſive matter will remain, which water alone will reach and carry off.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. No pains ſhould be ſpared to ſupply a city with freſh run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning water.</p>
                  <p>It is a point of infinite importance that citizens ſhould not depend on water from pumps in the city. In a few years, the ſubterranean water becomes impregnated with the noxious parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles from vaults—and this evil continues to increaſe with the age of the city. One of two remedies are to be provided—either the city muſt be ſupplied with freſh water by pipes from a diſtant ſource; or the vaults muſt be ſo formed as to be capable of being opened in winter and cleanſed. But the laſt method, tho uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and practiſed in ſome European cities, would be ineffectual.</p>
                  <p>The back houſes in a city are, in many reſpects, a terrible nuiſance. If a ſewer could be carried four or five feet under ground, and every ſuch houſe be ſet over it, a ſtream of water paſſing thro it from a diſtant ſource, would be an excellent means of cleanſing a city from this ſource of diſeaſe. But ſuch ſtreams of water are rarely to be obtained.</p>
                  <p>Another expedient ſuggeſts itſelf for the ſame purpoſe. Let a ſewer of three feet wide and well paved, be run in a ſtrait
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:036687_0606_100AA57EB693B1E8"/>
line under the rear of the lots, and all back houſes ſet over it. In ſuitable places, let channels be made to turn the water from the ſtreets into the ſewers, in long or violent ſhowers, when the water is not wanted to waſh the ſtreets. In this manner, the ſewers might be waſhed perfectly clean, a number of times every ſummer, and the citizens preſerved from their poiſonous exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
                  <p>On a model of this kind, I conceive cities ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the <hi>moſt healthy</hi> ſituations; for a crouded population, in any place on earth, will leſſen the ſalubrity of the air. Cloſe compact cities, in any quarter of the globe, are the graves of men. All the great cities of Europe require annually ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſtrangers to ſupply their waſte of population. Yet there is no neceſſity for men to croud together in ſuch a compact form. There is land enough on earth to ſuffer any extenſion of cities, and it makes little difference, in the firſt inſtance, whether a lot contains one hundred feet of land or half an acre. Nor would a leſs denſe population be any inconvenience to men, in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. They might be obliged to walk further on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but in the cool ſhade of my propoſed city, this would be a pleaſure rather than a toil.</p>
                  <p>It is wrong, it is criminal, for legiſlatures to permit ſuch crouded population. It is a nuiſance, not only to cities, but to the public. It is a truth, that numbers of lives are ſacrificed almoſt every year, among worthy country gentlemen, who have buſineſs in our large cities.</p>
                  <p>They come to town in the hot ſeaſon, when no uncommon diſeaſe prevails among the citizens who are innured to the air— they come without ſuſpicion—they are ſeized with fever and die. The air of the low grounds in our cities, even in healthy ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is often poiſon to people from the country, and gives them a fever, when no epidemic is viſible among citizens. I know the fact, and it is a ſerious calamity, eſpecially to ſeamen. The low grounds in Providence, New-York, Baltimore, &amp;c. are great nuiſances. The building of Water-ſtreet and Front-ſtreet in New-York, it is believed by good judges, has coſt this city a thouſand lives in five or ſix years. I ſay nothing of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia; for its poſition and the alterations in the original plan of
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:036687_0607_100AA580E301CEA8"/>
the city have doomed it to calamity. The citizens will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the evil to ariſe among themſelves and therefore muſt be left to their fate. If remitting fevers <hi>every</hi> year, and yellow fever <hi>often,</hi> will not convince men that ſomething is wrong in <hi>their</hi> city, it is in vain to reaſon with them. Of one thing I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that if all the earth in New-York on which Water and Front-ſtreets are built, could be ſunk 30 feet under water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſs of lives, and the proprietors indemnified by the citizens, it would be the greateſt bleſſing which heaven could in mercy beſtow on the city and the ſtate. I believe alſo, that if all the croſs ſtreets and the back houſes in Philadelphia could be levelled with the earth, and the ground converted into flower gardens and graſs plats, the citizens would, in twenty years, cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebrate the anniverſary of their deſtruction, with as much fervor as the republicans in France celebrate the demolition of the Baſtile.</p>
                  <p>It is not poſſible, I ſpeak it with zeal and confidence; it is not poſſible, under the operation of the <hi>preſent</hi> laws of nature, for men to be healthy in many of our cities, during the heat of ſummer. That open champaign country, which regularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces intermitting and remitting fevers, will, when planted with populous cities, often produce the plague. Of that country, there is an extent in the United States, of more than one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles in length, and from 40 to 60 in breadth.</p>
                  <p>All the ſhore of the Atlantic from the Hudſon north-eaſtward will admit of healthy cities. If the commercial towns on that portion of America were conſtructed on the foregoing plan, I would anſwer for it, that they would never be ravaged with yellow fever. Individual caſes might occur; but the diſeaſe could not, without a miracle, become epidemic. But as our towns are now built they will at times be partially affected. In <hi>ordinary</hi> ſeaſons and with a vigilant police they will eſcape, with the yearly loſs of only ten, fifteen or perhaps fifty citizens, the unfortunate victims of the negligence, the folly, and the crouded population of cities. In very <hi>unfavorable ſeaſons,</hi> the number of victims will be <hi>increaſed. Such is the fate of our northern cities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the deſtiny of cities on the ſouthern Atlantic ſhore, is to be more ſevere.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="253" facs="unknown:036687_0608_100AA58269826760"/>The period of general contagion may ſubſide, and intervals of more general public health, may be expected. The moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy parts of the earth enjoy ſuch intervals, when the rage of malignant complaints is ſuſpended. But the melancholy periods of epidemics will often recur—and as the plague, in all its ſhapes, is the offspring of <hi>cauſes,</hi> mankind, wherever thoſe cauſes exiſt, are deſtined to be afflicted.</p>
                  <p>Away then with crouded cities—the 30 feet lots and alleys— the artificial reſervoirs of filth—the hot beds of atmoſpheric poiſon. Such are our cities—they are great priſons, built with immenſe labor to breed infection and hurry mankind prematurely to the grave.</p>
                  <p>There is no neceſſity for this deſtruction of human life. Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies laid out on my plan would unite all the pleaſures of country villages, rural ſeats, and commercial towns. The merchant, in his ordinary buſineſs, would enjoy the grateful ſhade of oaks and elms, with the luxuriant perfumes of odoriferous flowers. At the ſame time, this verdant city would ſuperſede the uſe of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary country-ſeats in ſummer; and thus ſave the expenſe now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred of poſſeſſing a town and country houſe. The country ſeat of a merchant, is a tax of ten, fifteen or twenty thouſand dollars, paid to maintain the poiſon and peſtilence of our preſent cities.</p>
                  <p>It is remarked by Boyle and other authors that China is rarely affected with the plague. The peſtilence of 1347 is ſaid to have commenced in that country; but it ſeems to be agreed that China and ſome other Aſiatic countries are not often affected. This fact, if juſt, deſerves inveſtigation; in particular ought philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers to examin the nature and properties of the ſoil and the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral productions.</p>
                  <p>China is a very populous country, filled with canals, and well cultivated. It is probable that the water in the canals is never ſtagnant, nor filled with vegetables—it is probable that the face of the country has been completely dried by cultivation, all ſwamps and moiſt grounds drained and covered with corn, rice and graſs. How much theſe improvements have contributed to preſerve its inhabitants from peſtilence, I need not inform my readers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="254" facs="unknown:036687_0609_100AA584AB93D688"/>The cities alſo in China are vaſtly large and populou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and an enquiry will ariſe, how thoſe cities eſcape the plague, if great population contributes ſo much to the calamity.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, they do not eſcape all plagues—ſome of the moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent have ravaged China; but they probably eſcape the ſlighter plagues, which are the moſt frequent; and this is all that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind can expect.</p>
                  <p>We are not ſufficiently acquainted with the ſoil, climate, police and manners of China, to ſpeak with certainty on this ſubject; but one fact ought to be mentioned. The Chineſe houſes have no windows in front, on the ſtreet, but in the rear, are ſpacious gardens filled with trees, vegetables, flowers, and freſh ſtreams of water. Here the family is regaled and amuſed; the air is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered pure by cultivation, cleanlineſs, and the particles exhaled from growing plants, and water-falls. This arrangement alone will account for their exemption from the uſual diſeaſes of hot climates.—When the Americans, with their boaſted light and ſcience, ſhall become as <hi>wiſe</hi> as the Chineſe, they may expect to ſhare in the exemption.</p>
                  <p>It is a fact related by Ruſſel and others, that in the midſt of the Turkiſh cities, during a deſolating plague, the ſpacious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the wealthy Turks, which are kept clean, and well aired, often eſcape the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>I cannot leave this deeply intereſting ſubject, without relating an anecdote from antiquity, which ſhows in what light wiſe men formerly viewed it.</p>
                  <p>In Greece, the countries of Attica and Lacedemon, conſiſt of dry, gravelly or rocky land; and I can find but one inſtance, in which thoſe countries were affected by peſtilence, in the early ages. It is evident from Thucydides, that the plague had never been known in Athens before his time, ſince the date of the earlieſt traditions; and then it was probably induced principally by the croud of people collected in the ſiege, to eſcape the rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Lacedemonians.</p>
                  <p>Boeotia, on the contrary, was more frequently viſited by peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. To account for this, let us know what was the ſituation of this country. It is thus deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="unknown:036687_0610_100AA586E595C7C8"/>Boeotia may be conſidered as a large baſon, ſurrounded by mountains, the different chains of which are connected by high grounds. Moſt of the rivers from theſe hills unite in Lake Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pais, of fourteen leagues circumference, which has no apparent outlet; but, it was alleged by the ancients, to have ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an paſſages into the ſea. The country is not without hills, but is moſtly level, and very fruitful. The air in Attica is rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pure; but in Boeotia, very denſe; hence the ancients derived the heavy, phlegmatic character of its inhabitants from the air. This country ſeems to have been to Attica, what Holland now is to France.</p>

                  <p>From ſeveral paſſages of hiſtory, it appears that Boeotia was more frequently viſited by peſtilence than Attica. This we ſhould expect from the difference of their ſituations.</p>
                  <p>Juſtin, lib. 16. ca. 3. informs us, that the Boeotians once conſulted the Delphic Oracle, how to remedy the plague that troubled them. The Oracle replied, "That they muſt plant a colony in the country of Pontus, ſacred to Hercules." But they were ſo much attached to their own country, that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed the injunction; until another calamity, war, drove them to conſult the Oracle a ſecond time, when, receiving a ſimilar anſwer, a part of the people removed to the borders of the Eux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, and founded the famous city of Heraclea.</p>
                  <p>This Oracle certainly underſtood the cauſe of the evil, and directed to a ſuitable remedy. The anſwer implies, "you muſt thin your population," or "you muſt ſeek a more ſalubrious cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate," or it might comprehend both theſe ideas. The direction is full of wiſdom, and is ſtrictly applicable to many of our Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican cities. Tranſlated into the language of our circumſtances, it runs thus "thin your population, by ſpreading your citizens over a larger extent of ground, or you will often be driven from your cities, into the country."</p>
                  <p>We have Moſes and the prophets, in books and experience, and if we will not liſten to them, neither the Delphic Oracle, nor a meſſenger from the thouſands of dead who have periſhed by the plagues of our cities, would induce belief or effect a reformation.</p>

                  <head>SECTION XVIII. Of the diſappearance of the plague in ſome parts of Europe, and of new diſeaſes.</head>
                  <p>IT is a common remark that no plague has appeared in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſince the year 1665, and that the diſorder has ceaſed in the weſt of Europe, for near a century paſt. This happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from that horrible calamity has been aſcribed to various cauſes. Many people aſcribe it to health laws—a ſubject that has been already diſcuſſed. Some allege that the uſe of foſſil coal has baniſhed the plague from London; and Hoffman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that Halle in Germany, which uſed to be afflicted with malignant fevers, has been free from them ſince coal has been uſed as fuel. Others ſuppoſe that the great improvements in building and in the modes of living, in modern times, have been the means of preventing the return of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>On the firſt cauſe, I have already given my opinion, and the reaſons on which it is founded. I find no ſufficient evidence that health laws ever ſaved a country or city from peſtilence, in a ſingle inſtance; but abundant poſitive proof of their utter ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, in a great number of caſes.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the uſe of coal, we ought not to indulge very ſanguine expectations. It may be true, that violent diſeaſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more rare or wholly diſappeared, in ſome places, about the time that coal became of general uſe as fuel. But let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin facts, and not truſt to general curſory obſervations.</p>
                  <p>The digging of coal at New-Caſtle for fuel commence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> early as the year 1234, as appears by a charter of Henry III. and how much earlier, is not known. It was uſed in London as early as 1379, in conſiderable quantities; but when firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, does not appear. In 1550, coal was in common uſe
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:036687_0612_100AA58B16DAE808"/>
in London—its price "twelve ſhillings a load." The price in 1590 was raiſed to "nine ſhillings a chaldron," which was deemed exorbitant. Thus far we have little light on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but in 1615, the coal trade occupied four hundred ſhips; <hi>two hundred</hi> of which were employed between London and New-Caſtle. The preſent number is <hi>five hundred,</hi> and London con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains more than double the inhabitants it did at that time.</p>
                  <bibl>See Anderſon's Com. vol. 1. and Fleetwood's Chron.</bibl>
                  <p>In 1615 then the uſe of coal muſt have been general in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and for ſome time before, for the growth of the trade muſt have been gradual. But for fifty years after this general uſe of coal, London was afflicted by the plague; the city indeed was rarely free from it, as appears by the bills of mortality, and three times, after that period, the city was ravaged by that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper as an epidemic, viz. in 1625, 1636 and 1665.</p>
                  <p>So far we have no encouragement to hope for a prevention of the plague by the uſe of coal. With reſpect to the city of Halle, I can ſay nothing. The obſervation of Hoffman may be juſt, and yet coal may have had no influence in checking the prevalence of peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>It belongs to phyſicians to aſcertain the effect of the vapor from this foſſil ſubſtance on human health. Certain it is, that it occaſions inconveniences to thoſe who are not accuſtomed to it. So general was the prejudice againſt it, when firſt uſed in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that in the year 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>00, the nobility and citizens petitioned the king "to prohibit the further uſe of ſo noxious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy a kind of fuel." And. Com. vol. 6. Ap. 935. There is reaſon to believe it is not very unhealthy, but I ſee no ground to ſuppoſe it has had the leaſt influence in arreſting the progreſs, or preventing the return of the plague.</p>
                  <p>To confirm this opinion, I would mention that the plague diſappeared in France and other parts of Europe, about the time it did in England; in Paris, for inſtance, where no coal is uſed. In a great part of Europe therefore the ſame effect has taken place, without the ſuppoſed cauſe; which leaves us at liberty to reject that cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The third reaſon aſſigned for the ceſſation of the plague, viz.
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:036687_0613_100AA58D424B3C08"/>
improvements in building houſes and cities, and in clothing, diet, the uſe of freſh water and the like, is a juſt one; and there can be no rational doubt that theſe alterations have contributed to mitigate the violence and reſtrain the progreſs, of many acute diſeaſes. Peſtilential epidemics are probably leſs frequent within the laſt century, at leaſt in the more civilized and commercial parts of Europe, and alſo in America, than they had been in former periods.</p>
                  <p>The poverty, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the dirty, crouded mud cottages, and the ſcanty ſupply of wholeſome food, which was the common fare of the peaſantry, in Europe, muſt have given origin or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to many diſeaſes; and greatly aggravated their ſeverity. A ſample of this may be ſeen in the early appearance of mortal diſeaſes in the low narrow ſtreets and ſmall crouded apartments now occupied by the poorer people in our cities, and the difficulty of expelling a peſtilential diſeaſe from ſuch places.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>As a general remark it may be alleged with great probability that Europe has derived no ſmall benefit, in regard to public health, from the following circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt. From the modern improvements in agriculture, by which means many places are dried and ſweetened, which uſed to be cold, damp and fetid.</p>
                  <p>Agriculture not only removes, from the earth, ſubſtances po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively noxious to health; but covers its ſurface with growing vegetables poſitively ſalubrious. This is one inſtance of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:036687_0614_100AA5901125ADD0"/>
in the economy of the world, in which the happineſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and intereſt of man are made to depend on his induſtry.</p>
                  <bibl>See Dr. Ruſh's Works, vol. 1. p. 25.</bibl>
                  <p>Secondly. Improvements in building houſes may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the ſame ſalutaray end. The materials are of a kind leſs ſuſceptible of accumulating and retaining infectious exhalations, than formerly—the apartments are more ſpacious, elevated and airy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. Houſes are leſs crouded than in ancient times, as appears by the proclamation of Queen Elizabeth, recited in the foregoing hiſtory. In London, one perſon, ſince the fire of 1666, is ſuppoſed to occupy as much ſpace as two in the old city. This remark applies eſpecially to the poor, who were formerly more numerous than at preſent. Some of the nobles, in the old city, had ſpacious gardens, but the maſs of people were miſerably poor and crouded into narrow filthy lodgings.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. There is probably an immenſe difference in regard to general cleanlineſs, between the people even of the ſixteenth century, and the preſent age. For this we are partly indebted to commerce, the ſource of wealth and refinement. A more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral uſe of linen and cotton in cloathing, articles which require waſhing frequently, may have contributed to the ſame object.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly. The introduction of pure water into cities from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſources, and a liberal uſe of it, in houſes, and the ſtreets, have aided in the ſame ſalutary work of diminiſhing the calamities of diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly. It is believed that the modern diet is more friendly to health than that of former times. It is evident that to this change Europe is much indebted for the diſappearance of ſcorbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic complaints, which formerly were epidemic in Holland and other parts, and which ſtill prevail in Iceland and Canada, where the poor live moſtly on dried or ſalted fiſh, poor fleſh meats, with a ſmall portion of vegetables. The cultivation of the vine and the orchard has doubtleſs had a conſiderable effect. Cider and wine have aſſiſted in preſerving the body from debility in certain peſtilential periods; and when temperately uſed, are of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="260" facs="unknown:036687_0615_100AA592399B8730"/>But I apprehend that the moderns have aſcribed too much to theſe cauſes. Any man who will read hiſtory with care, will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that there has been, within about a century, a conſiderable abatement of peſtilence in all parts of the world. The plague is far leſs deſtructive in the Levant, and Egypt, within 150 years, than it was in former ages. This mitigation has been cotemporary in all parts of the earth, of which we have any correct knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge. The cauſe of this change, I pretend not to aſſign; but a ſimilar abatement has been obſerved in the violence of earthquakes.</p>
                  <p>While I admit however that the true plague has diſappeared as an epidemic in many parts of Europe, I do not admit that <hi>peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> in the general ſenſe of the word, has wholly diſappeared. If the true plague, technically ſo called, ſhould never again occur in London or Paris, I ſhould then ſay, that improvements in mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern times may have <hi>mitigated the peſtilence,</hi> but not that they have wholly baniſhed it. Under this word peſtilence, I include ſmall-pox, anginas and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>techial fever, with other malignant diſorders, which evidently depend on the ſame general cauſe as the real plague, operating with leſs force. Theſe diſeaſes ſtill appear in all parts of Europe, and exhibit the <hi>exiſtence of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential principle,</hi> altho improvements may have <hi>leſſened</hi> and <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ibed</hi> its effects.</p>
                  <p>I do not however conſider it as certain that the true plague will not reviſit all the weſtern parts of Europe. A concurrence of cauſes, like that in 1348, might again produce that diſeaſe in France, England and Ireland, with all its horrors. But the probability is, that the modern improvements have removed ſo many of the <hi>local cauſes</hi> of diſeaſe, that no conſtitution of air will ever again produce the ſame mortality, as that under Vorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern or that under Edward III; nor will the plague ever again be ſo frequent, as in former ages.</p>
                  <p>On this point however there is not ſufficient ground to build any certain calculations, for the following reaſons. Every phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and hiſtorian well knows that there have been frequent rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olutions or changes in the form of certain diſeaſes—ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes with new ſymptoms, and diſeaſes before unknown, have appeared in various countries and in all periods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="261" facs="unknown:036687_0616_100AA593C50DBB50"/>The moſt remarkable of theſe are the ſmall-pox, venereal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſweating ſickneſs, Hungarian fever, petechial fever and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina maligna, with ſome of leſs note.</p>
                  <p>I am not about to enter on the great queſtion, when or how particular diſeaſes have been introduced or modified in their ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. I ſuſpect however there is a fallacy in the common theory about <hi>new</hi> diſeaſes. What are uſually called <hi>new</hi> are more prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably nothing more than the changes that are made in former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, by alterations in the atmoſphere, climate, habits of living and a multitude of inferior cauſes. The ſmall-pox and the venereal diſeaſe ſeem to have the beſt claim to the appellation of <hi>new;</hi> yet the fact of their being unknown before the periods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for their appearance, has been juſtly called in queſtion. See <hi>note</hi> at the end of this Section.</p>
                  <p>Certain diſeaſes however appear in particular countries, where they had not before been known, ſince the date of the earlieſt hiſtories. Poſſibly ſome have been propagated by infection; others have evidently ariſen from ſome general cauſe. Thus Pliny relates that the eliphantiaſis was brought from Egypt into Italy, by Pompey's troops, but ſoon diſappeared. It is ſaid alſo that the ſame diſeaſe was propagated in the weſt of Europe by the Cruſaders. Epidemic ſcurvy appeared in the maritime parts of Holland in 1556. The petechial fever which deſolated Spain in 1557, and afterwards all Europe, was called a <hi>new</hi> diſeaſe, different from the uſual purple fever, and ſaid to be ſpread from the iſlands of the Levant through Italy to the weſt of Europe. The angina maligna, in Spain in 1610, was called there a <hi>new</hi> diſeaſe; and in England, where it appeared about fifty years ago, it has been called a new diſeaſe in that country.</p>
                  <p>But the real ſtate of the queſtion ſeems to be, that epidemic diſeaſes, moſt or all of which proceed from qualities of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, ſuffer general changes, in conformity with the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and alterations which take place in the phyſical world. A remarkable inſtance of this, was the ſudor anglicus, which was, in its general ſymptoms, the plague; but ſome general cauſe in England firſt and afterwards on the continent, ſuperadded a peculiar ſymptom, that of profuſe diſcharges by the pores. This character of the diſeaſe, as has been well obſerved by the
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:036687_0617_100AA596242B75E0"/>
author of Traité de la peſte, was the effect of a ſpecies of revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the form of peſtilence. Infection or contagion can have had no concern in producing this phenomenon. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe maintained this peculiar character from 1483 to 1551, a period of almoſt 70 years, raging occaſionally in moſt parts of Europe and then diſappeared; at leaſt it has never made conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable ravages ſince that time.</p>
                  <p>This, in medical language, was a <hi>new</hi> diſeaſe, as demanding new modes of treatment; but in the language of philoſophy, it was only a varied form of the ſame malady, and proceeding from a common cauſe, with the inguinal plague, but that cauſe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular times and places, was modified in its operation. What confirms this idea is, that this ſweating diſeaſe never appeared as an iſolated epidemic, but was always cotemporary with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon plague in other countries—that is, it formed a part of the general effects of the peſtilential principle. Thus in 1483, about the time of its firſt occurrence in England, all Europe was deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the common plague. Denmark loſt half its inhabitants, and many other countries fared very little better. The ſame may be obſerved of its ſubſequent returns, and of its prevalence in Ireland, Holland, France and Germany.</p>
                  <p>This is what I call a revolution in peſtilence, and it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to many other changes in the predominant diſeaſes of the human race.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>It aſtoniſhes me to read in modern books the poſitive aſſertions, "that the plague is never generated in Great-Britain, or other north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern latitudes." See Mead, James' Medical Dictionary, Cullen, Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clopedia and other original works and compilations without number. Lord Verulam, Sir Thomas Moore, Boyle, Eraſmus, Diemerbroeck and other luminaries of former centuries, who ſaw the plague frequently in all its varieties, never pretended that the diſeaſe was not produced in their reſpective countries. The ſudor anglicus, not only appeared <hi>firſt</hi> in England, but for the firſt time of its prevalence was confined to Engliſhmen. Yet this was the moſt violent and deſtructive form of the plague that ever has been known.</p>
                        <p>"Nuper novum peſtilentiae genus immiſit Deus, letiferum ſudorem, quod <hi>a Britannis exortum,</hi> incredibili celeritate, per orbem longe lateque divagatum eſt—plurium exitio, ſummo terrore omnium."</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the petechial fever, which ravaged Europe in the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century was called a <hi>new</hi> diſeaſe; but I conceive it to
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:036687_0618_100AA598DADBDAC0"/>
have been no more than a varied form of the common purple fever, induced by ſome general variation in the elemental cauſe of epidemics, or by the ſeaſons. It formed a part of the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential ſeries, and was the precurſor of the plague, as it is to this day, altho it has rarely been ſo general or fatal as about the year 1556 and from 1570 to 1576.</p>
                  <p>It is remarkable alſo that the general cauſe extended over the Atlantic, and gave the ſame character to the fevers of the Weſt-Indies. The diſeaſe which reduced the forces of Sir Francis Drake at Carthagena, in 1586, was called <hi>calenture;</hi> a ſpecies of malignant ſpotted fever.</p>
                  <bibl>Purchas, vol. 4. 1182.</bibl>
                  <p>A ſimilar fever infected the people under Sir Thomas Gates, bound to Virginia, in the beginning of the laſt century. And if Ulloa is correct in ſtating that the infectious yellow fever never appeared at Carthagena, till about the year 1730, we have a remarkable proof of a revolution in the diſeaſes of that climate. We are to conclude from the facts, that the calenture was a diſtinct form of the peſtilence incident to the country, till the beginning of the preſent century; ſince which, it has aſſumed the character of our bilious plague. I am however inclined to queſtion the fact. The true yellow fever has been known in the Engliſh iſlands from their firſt ſettlement. It reduced Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's forces when they took Jamaica in 1655.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be obſerved that the true form of plague is never known in Spaniſh America. But at Quito, and other places, malignant diſtempers under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>me of <hi>ſpotted</hi> fevers, and pleuriſies, ſweep away prodigious numbers of people and fall but little ſhort of the inguinal plague.</p>
                  <bibl>Ulloa, vol. 1. 279—281.</bibl>
                  <p>Such then is the peſtilence of South-America; but in other periods, it may take a different form.</p>
                  <p>Theſe obſervations alſo lead to an explanation of the phenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena of the angina maligna. It was called a <hi>new</hi> diſeaſe in Spain and England, when it firſt appeared in 1610; but this is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. It is evidently deſcribed as epidemic a century or two before thoſe periods. But the truth is, <hi>that form</hi> of peſtilence had diſappeared for a long period and given way to ſome other
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:036687_0619_100AA59B10B09D10"/>
diſeaſe. After a time, it re-appeared, perhaps with ſome new ſymptoms.</p>
                  <p>The ſame remarks apply to the Hungarian fever, the peculiar ſymptoms of which firſt occurred in the ſixteenth century; and to a multitude of local and temporary epidemics, which have been called, on account of ſome ſingular ſymptoms, <hi>new</hi> diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe facts ſerve to explain my idea of the diſappearance of the plague in certain parts of Europe. I conſider the angina maligna as peſtilence of the worſt kind; and its occurrence in modern times, ſince the glandular plague is leſs frequent, may be only one of the revolutions in diſeaſes of a malignant type, which have marked other periods. The deſtructive force of the peſtilential principle, falls principally upon the throat, inſtead of the brain or the glands, and moſtly upon youth. This may be the principal form of peſtilence for a century or two, when it may diſappear and give way to the common plague, or to ſome new combination of ſymptoms, which ſhall p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſs for a <hi>new</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. A conjecture of this kind is authorized by ſeveral changes in the general characters of diſeaſes, at particular periods of the world. I do not therefore conſider it to be <hi>certain,</hi> that the parts of Europe, which have eſcaped the plague for a century, are ſecure of permanent exemption from that calamity.</p>
                  <p>This conjecture ſeems to be authorized by the evident mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the plague in the Levant, within a century. Plagues, it has been before obſerved, are obviouſly leſs frequent and leſs ſevere, in Egypt and Turkey, than they were in former ages. This remark I believe to be new, but it is a fact; and this miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation correſponds in time with the diſappearance of the diſeaſe in the healthy parts of Europe. From this circumſtance, I conclude that this change is the effect of ſome general cauſe, in the ſtate of the elements.</p>
                  <p>This opinion may derive great ſtrength, from revolutions or changes in the natural world, analagous to that in the character of epidemic diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>It is generally ſuppoſed by philoſophers, that earthquakes are leſs frequent and violent, in modern days, that in the firſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies after the Chriſtian era, and the imperfect ſurvey I have
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:036687_0620_100AA59CDA8ABD20"/>
taken of their hiſtory, gives me reaſon to believe the opinion well founded.</p>
                  <p>The eruption of volcanoes is very often ſuſpended for a long period. Etna was quiet about forty-five years, at the beginning of the preſent century. The volcanic mountain in Teneriffe, which had been quiet ever ſince the year 1704, again diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its fires in Auguſt laſt—after a ſuſpenſion of ninety-four years. There are other volcanic mountains that have ſlumbered for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny centuries, as Lipari, near Sicily.</p>
                  <p>The aurora borealis has its revolutions. Sometimes it diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears for half a century or more; then returns, and frequently illuminates the heavens.</p>
                  <p>The ſeaſons, on a ſmaller ſcale, manifeſt analagous revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. At certain periods, we have mild winters; very little froſt and ſnow, with ſoutherly winds, for a ſeries of years. Then we have a number of long, ſeverely cold winters in ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with violent tempeſts, deep ſnow, and perpetual north weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly winds. No leſs various are our ſummers, as to heat and moiſture.</p>
                  <p>The vegetable kingdom exhibits ſimilar changes, for which no viſible cauſe can be aſſigned. When our anceſtors firſt ſettled Maſſachuſetts, they raiſed wheat on the eaſtern coaſt, in the countries of Plymouth, Middleſex and Eſſex; but in the year 1664 mildew appeared for the firſt time to injure that uſeful arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſince that time, it has not been poſſible to raiſe wheat, within a conſiderable diſtance from the ſea ſhore.</p>
                  <p>It is related by the French that wheat had not been known to mildew in France, until the year 1550.</p>

                  <p>In 1770, the potatoe plant, in a particular part of Scotland, was attacked by a diſeaſe which was <hi>new;</hi> and it has ſince been ſpreading. A ſimilar fact is related of the oats in ſome parts of the ſame country, in 1775. Theſe diſeaſes, for they are really ſuch among vegetables, are <hi>new,</hi> and as far as they extend, they are a ſerious calamity. They are the peſtilences incident to veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etable life; which, like diſeaſes among men, ſpring up and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear, without any certain cauſes which are within our compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:036687_0621_100A89E6F1376D20"/>
It is cuſtomary to aſcribe ſuch phenomena to the <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> but it would be difficult to find any <hi>viſible</hi> or <hi>comprehenſible</hi> qualities in the particular ſeaſons, producing ſuch diſeaſes among vegetables, which had not characterized innumerable ſeaſons in former years, which produced <hi>no</hi> ſuch effects.</p>
                  <p>The death of prim and black thorn in our country, is a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar phenomenon.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes a new ſpecies of tree will ſpring up ſpontaneouſly and gradually ſpread, where none ever grew before. The pine has thus introduced itſelf into Duxborough in Maſſachuſetts, within the preſent century. Not twenty years ago, a man was living there who remembered the firſt white pine that ever grew in that town: but now one eighth part of the woodland is cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with it.</p>

                  <p>The animal world diſplays ſimilar changes and revolutions. We obſerve, not only uncommon numbers of common inſects or ſmall animals, in particular years, for which we can aſſign no ſpecific cauſe; but we actually ſee certain new ſpecies of inſects, and at times, known inſects grow to an uncommon ſize. Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the latter phenomenon have occurred in the locuſts, in the frog-kind, and in flies. The flies about Plymouth in 1633, and about New-London, the laſt ſummer, are deſcribed, as being not only diſtinguiſhable for their numbers, but for their ſize. Ancient authors have remarked the ſame phenomenon.</p>
                  <p>The millions of worms which ſpread over many hundred miles of territory in America in 1770, can no more be accounted for, than the ſudor Anglicus, or any other new form of diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>The inſect, which about twenty years ago, firſt appeared among the wheat, on Staten-Iſland, and which has continued to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and eſſentially injure the crops, over a great extent of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is unqueſtionably a non-deſcript as to America; a new form of animal life. Men are ever fond of propagating conjectures and vulgar tales for truth. The idle ſtory which imported this inſect from Germany, and gave it the name of Heſſian fly, has been proved, by careful enquiries, to be mere conjecture; no ſuch animal being known in Germany. Yet it has laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a durable error in natural hiſtory. So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="267" facs="unknown:036687_0622_100AA59F2DF10450"/>
of this vulgar prejudice, of imputing all their evils to others, that even inſects muſt, like plague, be imported!</p>
                  <p>This inſect is doubtleſs a new ſpecies of animal; it is one of thoſe varieties which nature is continually exhibiting, in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of her operations; it is a diſtemper incident to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular plant, and others perhaps in a leſs degree, which, like the ſudor anglicus may endure for half a century, and then diſappear; or it may be derived, from permanent cauſes, and deſtined, for a longer time, to annoy that ſpecies of vegetable life, like the mildew on the ſame plant, on the maritime borders of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts and New-Hampſhire. The mammoth of Siberia and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, whoſe enormous bones are ſeen in our muſeums, and whoſe race is ſuppoſed to be extinct, may be another inſtance of perpetual revolution in the works of nature.</p>
                  <p>The lofty pine, the glory of the foreſt, covers immenſe tracts of our native wilderneſs; but when cut down, is not propagated from the roots or ſtump, like moſt other trees. Yet I am told that in Carolina, whenever the lands are cleared of the native woods the young growth conſiſts moſtly of pines, tho far from any of that ſpecies of tree. Similar changes in the ſpecies of trees, are obſerved on the clearing of lands in other parts of America.</p>
                  <p>So alſo, on clearing our lands, in every part of America, the ſoil is ſoon covered with a full crop of white clover, of ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous origin.</p>
                  <p>Theſe productions are uſually aſcribed to the ſeeds of the plant, ſcattered by birds, which lie inert, while covered with ſhade and leaves, and germinate on the acceſs of the ſolar rays. This ſolution is conjectural; it is, like the importation of the fomes of epidemic diſeaſes, founded on mere ſuppoſition; it is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of careleſs, ſuperficial obſervers, who will not take the pains to extend their views over the works of nature. Do birds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the <hi>ſeeds of pine</hi> and of <hi>clover</hi> and ſpread them over hundreds of miles of the wilderneſs? Have theſe ſeeds been all ſcattered within a few years? Or will the ſeeds endure the froſt, the rain and the heat of ages, without periſhing or germinating? Beſides, birds feed on the ſeeds of other graſſes and plants, as well as
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:036687_0623_100AA5A201FD4700"/>
thoſe of white clover. Why are theſe not ſpead over our woods in the ſame manner?</p>
                  <p>The phenomena of the foreſts in America preclude the prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, or rather the poſſibility of ſuch events. The new plants that ſpring up, are generated by new powers in the elements, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by different combinations of heat, moiſture and air, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the labors of man; combinations which could not exiſt while the ground was clothed with trees of other ſpecies.</p>
                  <p>Plants are furniſhed with ſeeds for the purpoſe of propagation. This wiſe proviſion of a beneficent providence, is highly uſeful to man, and to animals which ſubſiſt on the ſeeds. But ſeeds are not neceſſary to the production of plants, in all climates. Every vegetable has ſome ſpot on the globe, where it is indigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, where it was originally produced without ſeed; and where it will beſt thrive, and grow to the higheſt ſtate of perfection. Such was the origin of moſt of the plants now known to man. The principles of animal and vegetable life were cotemporary with the formation of the earth. New ſpecies are generated on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe gradual alterations viſible in the operations of nature, or by accidental changes, induced by extrinſic and artificial cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Animals are alſo produced very often without any parent, but the elements. Hear what is recorded by that accurate obſerver, Dr. Lind, on the diſeaſes of hot climates, p. 208. "It is a phenomenon inconteſtibly true, that in ſtagnating pools of water at Bombay, produced ſolely by the rains, and which have no communication with any river or the ſea, living fiſh are generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; many perſons have eaten of them. Upon the drying up of the pools, they die and frequently are very offenſive."</p>
                  <p>I have not the leaſt doubt of this fact; and it is on this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple only that we can account for the exiſtence of fiſh of various kinds, eels, &amp;c. in brooks and ponds, on the tops of hills, above impaſſible falls; and in lakes which have no outlet. And we prove the generation of ſuch animals in the places where they exiſt, not only by the impracticability of their finding a paſſage to ſuch ſituations; but by the fact, that many ſpecies of them are never found in ſalt water, and probably could not exiſt in it.
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:036687_0624_100AA5A40B000270"/>
Any perſon may be convinced of the utter impoſſibility of fiſh's making their way to the heads of many ſmall ſtreams, where they are found, by examining innumerable ſuch ſtreams on our moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, which are full of trout and other ſmall fiſh, above perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular falls among ſolid rocks, of 50 or 100 feet in height.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, the elements of air and water are fitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce animals of the kinds proper to ſubſiſt in them; and ſo are plants. Not a vegetable in the field is found without its worm, its fly or other inſect, which it generates or feeds; and the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal when peculiar to a plant, has the color and the properties of that plant. Not a ſpecies of vegetable or animal matter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a ſuitable degree of heat and moiſture, which does not produce its inſect. Even living animals are not an exception. Are not the large worms, formed in the human ſtomach, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of animal life? And are they produced by a germ depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an animal of the ſame kind? Not at all; the ſuppoſition is ridiculous. They are a diſeaſe, cauſed by the operation of heat and moiſture, on ſubſtances in debilitated ſtomachs, which fail to perform the uſual digeſtive functions.<note n="*" place="bottom">This is the common theory; ſome perſons ſuppoſe them not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, but a part of the animal economy, neceſſary to full health. This however makes no difference, as to the manner of their production.</note> All animals and plants have their diſeaſes; and the mildew on wheat, and the ſcar on vines, are probably the effect of the defective energies of the elements, and a conſequent defective proceſs in the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble functions; or of infects which are the produce of the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar operations of the elements.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1788 a horſe was publicly exhibited in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, with a living animal, of the worm ſpecies, in his eye. See Muſeum, vol. 3. 500. A worm of three inches in circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and 20 inches in length was found in the liver of Mrs. Holt of Philadelphia. Ibm. When theſe facts are known and acknowledged, will men ſtill be found to deny the doctrin of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal generation? Worms are often generated in the ſmall ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>All creation is full of theſe varieties. Even the ſtellary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions exhibit new ſtars, either ſtationary or revolving, which are
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:036687_0625_100AA5A5932B68E0"/>
viſible for a longer or ſhorter time, and then recede from human view. Other luminous appearances, reſembling a lamp, a ſpear, a beam, are often obſerved, for which we can aſſign no cauſe. The new ſtars may be revolving bodies, which appear to us only in a particular part of their orbits; but other ſingular celeſtial appearances are doubtleſs mere variations in the forms of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire.</p>
                  <p>The fiſh in the ocean are ſubject to the ſame revolutionary laws. They often abandon the banks where they have appeared for centuries, and appear in places where they were never before known. They are ſubject to epidemic maladies, as much as men or cattle; they often ſicken and die, and ſometimes it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the whole ſpecies, frequenting a particular bank, is ſuddenly extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>The changes in the diſeaſes of men; all the phenomena of ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idemics, in their origin and diſappearance, their increaſed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and novelty of ſymptoms, are the effects of ſimilar altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the elements which compoſe the ſyſtem. We are but one ſpecies of animals, whoſe bodies are compoſed of the ſame materials, and ſubject to the ſame laws, as the bodies of all other animals. Animal and vegetable ſubſtances are alſo compoſed of the ſame elements, variouſly combined; they are ſimply varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the forms of matter endowed with life. And the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual endowments of man, with all his boaſted pre-eminence, cannot exempt him from the operation of the general laws which govern every other form or combination of the elements.</p>

                     <p>The people in the north of Europe maintain moſt ſtrenuouſly that the plague never originates in their countries. Mead even affirms that the meaſles, as well as ſmall-pox, had its origin in Egypt.</p>

The inhabitants of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, I believe, admit that the plague <hi>may</hi> originate in that city; but it is believed by many perſons that this diſeaſe does not originate there; and they trace it to Egypt.

                     <p>In Smyrna, Syria, Cyprus, and all parts of Europe, the plague is aſcribed to foreign countries.

                     <p>Juſt ſo in America; it is not admitted by a great portion of people, that the climate can generate a peſtilence. The yellow fever which is the plague of the country, is, in popular opinion, always imported from the Weſt-Indies.

                     <p>That this was a common diſeaſe appears from the frequent mention of it in thoſe records; and that it was the ſame diſeaſe, now called <hi>venereal,</hi> appears from the deſcription of it given by Arden, phyſician to Richard II. and Henry IV. between 1377 and 1413; who ſpeaks of it as a "certain inward heat and excoriation of the urethra."</p>

                     <p>It is aſſerted by European authors that this diſeaſe was preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent among the natives of America, when the Spaniards firſt viſited the country. I cannot controvert the aſſertion, for I do not poſſeſs the original Spaniſh hiſtories of their firſt voyages. But it is poſſible this may have been true. It is ſomewhat ſtrange however, if that diſeaſe was formerly very prevalent among the natives, that in modern times, it ſhould hardly be known among them. Ulloa, in his voyage to South-America, book 6, declares that the "venereal diſtemper is ſeldom known among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives," altho ſo common among the Spaniards as to have loſt the infamy attached to it in other countries.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>Theſe remarks on the origin of diſeaſes proceed ſolely from my love of truth and ſound philoſophy. I am no more anxious to exone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the ſavages of America from the charge of communicating the lues venerea to Europeans; than I am to vindicate Egypt from the charge of originating all the plagues that have deſolated Europe.

or Arabia, and to have been propagated over the world by ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific contagion. But the ſmall-pox, altho we know not the time or place of its firſt appearance, is only a <hi>new form</hi> of that claſs of diſeaſes called, exanthemata, or eruptive. It is the produce of a <hi>revolution in diſeaſe,</hi> and now originates any where and every where, <hi>without contagion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the origin of the lues venerea, we are left in the dark, as we are with reſpect to the ſmall-pox. It is agreed on all hands that none of the Greek and Roman writers on med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icin, have deſcribed the diſeaſe. But there is not a ſhadow of doubt that a ſpecies of this diſeaſe exiſted in England as early as the Norman conqueſt; and probably in the other countries of Europe. Not a medical work of that period, if any was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the weſt of Europe, has ſurvived the ravages of time; and we are indebted to the legal eſtabliſhment of ſtews in South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, for the evidence of the exiſtence of that diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>It is however not at all improbable that about the year 1496, this diſeaſe might have acquired ſome new and malignant ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and ſpread with a fatal rapidity, that might alarm man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind and render the diſtemper more an object of notice. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to that period, it might have been much more mild and leſs deſtructive. This idea is greatly ſtrengthened by the known fact that other diſeaſes had, about the ſame time undergone ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar changes. It was but about ten years before, that the plague took the <hi>ſweating</hi> form—an event as novel, as the generation of a new diſeaſe. What is more remarkable; in the very year aſſigned for the appearance of the lues venerea, an epidemic lep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſy overran Germany; an event equally novel. Theſe facts confirm my ideas of certain revolutions in the ſymptoms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, correſponding with material changes in climate or modes of life.</p>

                  <head>CONCLUSION, Addreſſed to the learned Societies, in America, Europe and Aſia.</head>
                  <p>THE preceding hiſtory of Epidemic diſeaſes was undertaken ſolely from a deſire of inveſtigating the truth, reſpecting the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and phenomena of theſe terrible ſcourges of the human race. When the peſtilence appeared in the United States in 1791 and 93, I had not a ſuſpicion that the popular doctrins reſpecting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, are not well founded. The frequent recurrence of the diſeaſe in ſubſequent years, in oppoſition to all the beſt efforts of health officers, in executing rigid laws of quarantine, had, in 1795, ſhaken my confidence in thoſe doctrins. My inveſtigations in that and the next year, convinced me that the peſtilential fever which has viſited ſo many parts of America, is generated in the country; but ſtill I had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of a connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween epidemic diſeaſes. The inveſtigations of the year paſt, have reſulted in unfolding p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nciples and facts to me altogether <hi>new</hi> and <hi>ſurpriſing;</hi> they cannot therefore be aſcribed to a wiſh to eſtabliſh a preconceived theory.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reſults not only confirm my ſuſpicions that the peſtilence of America is of domeſtic origin, but they overthrow the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceived ſyſtem of the origin of peſtilence, in temperate lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, from fomes conveyed to thoſe climates from ſouthern re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; and demonſtrate that it originates occaſionally in all lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itudes from the 25th to the 65th.</p>
                  <p>It is demonſtrated that peſtilence, in temperate latitudes, is never an iſolated epidemic, but the criſis of a ſeries of epidemics; and we are furniſhed with the means of determining unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally the character of peſtilence in every caſe, on the following ſimple principles.</p>
                  <p>"If, on the appearance of peſtilence in a particular place, all
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:036687_0631_100AA5B3ABE13B08"/>
other diſeaſes ceaſe, or take ſome of its predominant ſymptoms, that peſtilence is generated in that place, and dependent on the ſtate of the elements."</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible, on phyſical laws, that this criterion ſhould ever fail.</p>
                  <p>Another criterion, almoſt infallible, is the prevalence of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diſeaſes before and after the peſtilence. If peſtilence is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceded by meaſles, affections of the throat, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory or typhus fevers with anomalous ſymptoms, and eſpecially by catarrh, that peſtilence is an epidemic, produced on the ſpot, and only the <hi>autumnal form of diſeaſe</hi>—the other diſeaſes, prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and following, being the vernal and hybernal forms, produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the ſame general principle.</p>
                  <p>Of the peſtilences which afflict mankind, in all climates, an immenſe proportion, probably nineteen twentieths, belong to this ſpecies—they are epidemics, beginning and ending at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the elements, under the co-operating influence of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and local cauſes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe epidemic peſtilences are more or leſs infectious, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their violence, or the places where they exiſt. In cloſe rooms and narrow alleys they are dangerous; hence their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in fleets, camps, jails, and particular parts of cities. But the infection of ſuch diſeaſes extends to the diſtance of a few feet only, and is capable of diſſipation in a free air, ſo as to reduce the danger of attending the ſick almoſt to nothing. The ſame is true of diſeaſes of mere infection, not epidemic.</p>
                  <p>Diſeaſes, dependent on infection only, are ſometimes introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into cities and hoſpitals, and occaſion conſiderable mortality. But they are propagated by contact or near approach only, and do not affect the character of other diſeaſes current in the place.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence reſulting from theſe principles is, that <hi>epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic</hi> peſtilence is not under human control—but diſeaſes propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by mere infection may be arreſted and ſubdued.</p>
                  <p>The only means of avoiding or mitigating epidemic peſtilence are firſt to withdraw the aid of local cauſes; ſecondly to fit the body, by modes of living, to reſiſt its cauſes—and thirdly, on failure of theſe, to remove from the place where its exiſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="unknown:036687_0632_100AA5B5E75AF768"/>The infection of all diſeaſes, even thoſe of ſpecific contagion, as ſmall-pox and meaſles, may be avoided by keeping at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the diſeaſed. The infection of diſeaſes not ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally contagious, as plague, yellow-fever, dyſentery and jail fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, may be nearly deſtroyed by free air, and cleanlineſs.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the primary cauſes of epidemic diſeaſes, we are in the dark; but we are certain, from all hiſtory and modern obſervations, that the cauſes of epidemic diſeaſes among the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, affect every ſpecies of animal and vegetable life.</p>
                  <p>The opinions which I have ſuggeſted concerning the general cauſe, ſeem to have a foundation in the coincidence of epidemic diſeaſes with numerous electrical phenomena. At the ſame time, the reader will conſider theſe opinions rather as <hi>conjectural,</hi> than <hi>poſitive.</hi> No certain concluſions can be drawn from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and imperfect ſeries of facts. More materials are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enable us to erect a theory of epidemics which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve full confidence.</p>
                  <p>The common doctrin of contagion is utterly inſufficient and unphiloſophical; for if admitted, it never leads us nearer to the cauſe. If we trace the yellow fever to the Weſt-Indies, and the plague to Egypt or Conſtantinople, we are not an inch nearer to the ſource; for theſe diſeaſes are not always to be found in thoſe countries; and the people there are as much puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled to find the ſource of them, as the people of Great Britain or America.</p>
                  <p>If we trace theſe diſeaſes to the coaſt of Africa, or to Siam, we are as diſtant as ever from the ſource; for many times, the diſeaſes are not to be found in thoſe countries, and ſeldom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are they ever found within the tropics, except among for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eigners.</p>
                  <p>Indeed nothing is more common than for the yellow fever to be <hi>imported into the Weſt-Indies in veſſels from the United States.</hi> When veſſels from northern latitudes have long paſſages, it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens that ſeamen are ſeized with the diſeaſe, before they arrive at the iſlands; and the Weſt-Indians may often allege the diſeaſe to be <hi>imported in ſuch veſſels, when it does not exiſt in the United States.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="unknown:036687_0633_100AA5B76EF7E148"/>In ſhort, the doctrin of deriving all peſtilential diſeaſes from contagion or infection, were it not for the immenſe miſchief it does to ſociety, would not deſerve a ſerious refutation. Infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a <hi>ſubordinate cauſe</hi> of the propagating of malignant diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; but is itſelf an <hi>effect</hi> of ſome more general cauſe, whoſe force is a hundred fold more powerful and formidable than that of infection. I have, in condeſcenſion to popular opinion, ſtated the evidence of the domeſtic origin of the bilious plague, as it ſtands on the arrival or non-arrival of veſſels, and other facts of that kind. But I really conſider all this evidence as trifling, when compared with the phenomena of the diſeaſe itſelf and its precurſors and attendants. The uniform appearance of other epidemics, as introductory to peſtilence, and manifeſting an eſſential change in the atmoſphere, with the numerous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companiments of the plague and yellow fever, amounts to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of domeſtic origin, which leaves no room for cavil or controverſy.</p>
                  <p>For the purpoſe of collecting facts, the only ſafe foundation of principles, and comparing the phenomena of diſeaſes and the elements, which occur nearly at the ſame time, in different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, I ſincerely wiſh and requeſt that all medical and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical ſocieties would undertake to regiſter facts and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to communicate them, by means of a general correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The facts to be regiſtered might be comprized under the following heads.</p>
                  <p>The time of the appearance and diſappearance of any epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic diſeaſe, with its general hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The places where it firſt occurs to be deſcribed, in regard to land and water, height of the land, conſtruction of the city or ſtreets, poſition as to points of compaſs, woods, moraſſes, &amp;c. The claſſes of people moſt generally affected.</p>
                  <p>The general ſtate of the ſeaſons, as to heat, and cold, drouth and moiſture.</p>
                  <p>The time of earthquakes, meteors, lumen boreale, and all ſingular celeſtial appearances—with unuſual tempeſts, eſpecially when accompanied with hail—all compared with the lunar phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="279" facs="unknown:036687_0634_100AA5B9DAB2AFB0"/>The appearance of unuſual inſects of all kinds, and any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance attending them.</p>
                  <p>Diſeaſes among cattle, ſheep and other animals.</p>
                  <p>Sickneſs and death of fiſh of all kinds.</p>
                  <p>Volcanic eruptions, with the phenomena preceding, attending and following them.</p>
                  <p>For the purpoſe of aſcertaining the lunar influence on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, or any diurnal influence, it would be deſirable that medical gentlemen ſhould note the days and the hours of the day when perſons are ſeized with particular diſeaſes—eſpecially epidemics—the hours of exacerbation and of paroxiſms in fever— the hours which are moſt fatal to the diſeaſed—and the time when convaleſcents are moſt apt to relapſe.—Theſe facts ſhould be compared with the poſition of the moon, in her orbit, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in regard to her perigee and apogee; conjunction and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; as alſo with the tides in the main ocean.<note n="*" place="bottom">The time of high and low water in rivers and bays may not be the true time, in the open ſea—or of the greateſt and leaſt influence of the moon.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Should the principles unfolded in the preceding work prove to be well founded, they will lead to many important practical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. If peſtilential fevers never appear in the temperate latitudes, without certain precurſors, men will, with careful obſervations, be enabled to foreſee the danger and prepare for it; or to uſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common diligence in removing the ſubordinate local cauſes.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. If in certain years peſtilential fevers are more predominant, than in others; and the condition of the elements fitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, is univerſal over ſea and land, the fact is of no ſmall moment in maritime affairs. Double precautions will be taken in fleets, and in merchantmen bound on long voyages.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. If peſtilence is progreſſive and firſt manifeſted in certain malignant fevers, the fact may be of great utility to large cities. The approach may be perceived in time to ſave the inhabitants by flight, if not by other precautions.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. If no plague or yellow fever ever appeared in temperate climates, unleſs announced by other diſtempers, the magiſtracy may be enabled to diſtinguiſh when there is danger, and when
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:036687_0635_100AA5BC7B947CB8"/>
not; and may avoid innumerable vexations to commerce, ariſing from the rigid execution of health laws, when there is not the leaſt occaſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. But a moſt important uſe to be made of the facts here col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, will be, to guard public health from the ill effects of bad proviſions. If, in peſtilential periods, ſalt is leſs efficacious in preſerving fleſh, and by means of a greater fermentation of the juices, fiſh and fleſh are more readily diſſolved by a putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factive proceſs, more caution will be found neceſſary in packing and repacking them, and more care to avoid uſing it in a bad ſtate.</p>
                  <p>If the effluvia of diſſolving fleſh and vegetables are more poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous and prejudicial to health at ſome times, than at others, it is of importance that, on every ſuch occaſion, early notice ſhould be given of the danger.</p>
                  <p>If animals, which conſtitute a part of the food of men, are ſubject to epidemic diſtempers, they cannot be eaten with ſafety, while affected by diſeaſe. When fiſh or fowls are ſickly and many of them die, or become lean, the fact ſhould be aſcertained by the faculty or a board of health, and public notice ſhould be given, that people might avoid uſing them as food. In ſome inſtances, fiſh are ſo ſickly as to excite nauſea; in which caſe the uſe of them ſhould be forbidden.</p>
                  <p>I will cloſe this treatiſe with the following reflections.</p>
                  <p>In the conſtruction of the univerſe, we obſerve every part of the ſyſtem to be governed by uniform laws, adapted, with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ſkill, to preſerve harmony and order. Limited as our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings are, we can diſcover many of theſe laws, which are calculated to impreſs on our minds the moſt ſublime ideas of the univerſal intelligence and wiſdom of their Great Author.</p>
                  <p>The exiſtence of natural and moral evils has led ſceptics to queſtion the perfections of the author of nature. But doubts on this ſubject argue want of knowlege or want of candor. It is extremely evident that all the neceſſary evils of the ſyſtem are calculated to produce good. The operation of that univerſal principle of light, heat and fire, which pervades our ſyſtem, and which is inceſſantly compounding and decompounding the other more ſluggiſh materials of the earth and atmoſphere, are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:036687_0636_100AA5BEA1795600"/>
to the viciſſitudes of the ſeaſons, rain, ſnow, hail and dew, which are neceſſary to preſerve the principles of animal and vegetable life. Storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, however inconvenient to men at particular times and places, are among the means of giving to the principles of life, more equal diſtribution, and of renewing their energies.</p>
                  <p>Epidemic diſeaſes are ſome of the neceſſary effects of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral laws that govern the univerſe. But they have alſo a final cauſe of immenſe value to the human race. They are deſtined and calculated to anſwer moſt important moral and religious purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>Men, with their preſent nature, under a conſtant courſe of proſperity, would degenerate into devils or brutes. Uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted eaſe and quiet contract the heart and ſteel it againſt emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſenſibility—the man ruſhes into vices and crimes, or ſinks into ſloth. So often have I ſeen the hearts of men depraved and their moral character debaſed, by ſudden proſperity, that I am perſuaded the world, without frequent inflictions of pain and diſtreſs, would not be habitable. The natural evils that ſurround us, intermingled with innumerable bleſſings, preſerve the mind in perpetual vigor, in ſeeking the means of protection; they lay the foundation for the exerciſe of the fineſt feelings of the human heart, <hi>compaſſion and benevolence,</hi> which are the ſources of ſocial virtue; they humble the pride and arrogance of man, by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in his mind a perpetual dependance on divine power; in ſhort, they create and preſerve that ſenſe of obligation and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countability to God which is the germ of piety, and moral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence.</p>

                     <head>Of the Lunar Influence.</head>
                     <p>IT is a well known fact that the moon has a great influence on the elements of this globe, the effects of which are very viſible in the viciſſitudes of weather. This influence is ſuppoſed to be the principal regulator of the tides, and the efficient cauſe of the changes in the atmoſphere, which produce rain, hail, ſnow and wind. It is believed alſo to affect the growth of plants, and Pliny, followed by St. Pierre, alleges that the lunar rays diſſolve ſnow and ice. Popular opinion conſiders the moon as exerting a powerful influence on animal ſubſtances, and it is an incontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible fact that its beams accelerate the putrefaction of fleſh and fiſh. Fiſhermen and ſailors can all atteſt this fact, and it coincides with what Pliny aſſerts. Nat. Hiſt. lib. 2. 101. "Id man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſtum eſſe, quod ferarum occiſa corpora in tabem viſo ſuo reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat."<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Pierre affirms that the moon melts ice, and relies on the paſſage of Pliny in the chapter cited, "glaciem refundat"—but it is queſtionable whether the paſſage will bear that conſtruction; and if it will, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of Pliny is not ſupported by modern obſervations. See Studies of Nature, Vol. 1. Expl. of the plates, p. 69. Ice is diminiſhed by evaporation in moon light, without forming water.</note> Moon light diſſolves or corrupts the fleſh of animals that are killed; it renders ſound fiſh ſoft in a few hours, and fiſhermen are careful to cover from its rays the fiſh they have caught.

                     <p>The Newtonian theory of tides, which explains the phenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ena by lunar attraction, has been recently called in queſtion and warmly oppoſed by the ingenious St. Pierre, in his ſtudies of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who ſubſtitutes a ſcheme of his own, which aſcribes the tides to the diurnal effuſions of the polar ices. I am charmed with the writings of St. Pierre, which have opened a
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:036687_0638_100AA5C26E1512C8"/>
new and entertaining volume of the works of nature. But his theory of tides ſeems to manifeſt none of that ingenuity, which is conſpicuous in other parts of his writings, and is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, during ſix months or more, in each polar region, no ſnow or ice is melted, unleſs by the moon. The ſun is below the horizon, and the moon's influence, if it diſſolves ſnow and ice according to Pliny, evaporates all the water pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. This is a fact that accords with modern experiments, that ice in the night, however cold, loſes a part of its weight, but it is by inſenſible evaporation.</p>
                     <p>To remove this difficulty, St. Pierre ſuppoſes the tides in one polar region to be the effect of the melting of ſnow and ice, in the oppoſite polar regions. But to this hypotheſis we may oppoſe an inſuperable objection, derived from the great and univerſal laws of equilibrium, obſerved by water. A diurnal wave or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation would inevitably ſubſide into a level, before it could reach the equator, or even the temperate latitudes. Beſides the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic is of very various breadth, in different latitudes. Between the coaſt of Brazil and Terra Firma on one ſide and Africa on the other, the breadth is ſcarcely half as great, as in the latitude of 25 deg. north. A diurnal wave compreſſed and dilated, in theſe different ſituations, muſt exhibit the tides in one place, twice as high as in another; but in the regions mentioned, this is not the fact.</p>
                     <p>There are many of the phenomena of the tides which cannot be explained on St. Pierre's hypotheſis; but the foregoing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks are ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe. The tides doubtleſs depend on lunar and ſolar influence; but the phenomena cannot be ſolved on the common theory of <hi>attraction.</hi> In this reſpect, I am confident the Newtonian theory, as explained by Kepler and others is as inadequate, as that of St. Pierre. The latter author has enumerated ſome inſuperable objections to that theory, to which the reader is referred. But I have other obſervations to make on this ſubject, which are probably new.</p>
                     <p>The manner in which aſtronomers have attempted to explain the oppoſite tides, is as follows. "The power of gravity dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes as the ſquare of the diſtance increaſes—therefore the waters
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:036687_0639_100AA5C5C9A9E468"/>
on the ſide of the earth next to the moon, are more attracted than the central parts of the earth; and the central parts are more attracted by the moon than the waters on the oppoſite ſide of the earth—therefore the diſtance between the earth's center and the waters on its ſurface, under and oppoſite to the moon, will be increaſed. The earth by its gravity falls towards the moon —the water directly below the moon riſes and ſwells towards her —the water on the oppoſite ſide recedes from the center and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes— or ſtrictly ſpeaking, the center recedes from the water. On the ſides of the earth between the points under and oppoſite to the moon, the water is depreſſed and falls below the former level."</p>
                     <bibl>See Ferguſons's Aſtronony, on the Tides, and Encyclopedia, Art. Aſtronomy, 363.</bibl>
                     <p>As I am not about engaging in aſtronomical or mathematical calculations, I ſhall content myſelf with ſtating theſe general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Newton, Kepler, and later aſtronomers, with a few objections.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. This theory does not explain, in a ſatisfactory manner, the reaſon why there are no tides in lakes and Mediterranean ſeas.</p>
                     <p>If the principle is juſt, that the earth recedes from the water oppoſite to the moon, leaving the ſurface of it at a greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the center, why, when the Euxine or Mediterranean is oppoſite to the moon, does not the earth beneath theſe ſeas, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from <hi>their</hi> waters, as well as from the waters of the ocean, in the ſame longitude? The earth conſiſts of ſolid ſubſtances, and by the laws of attraction, muſt, in all its parts, be moved equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, under the ſame circumſtances of diſtance from the attracting body and denſity, or ſolid contents. To ſuppoſe the earth, when covered by an ocean, to be attracted by the moon, and not when covered by a lake or arm of the ocean, is, in my view, neither logic nor philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the reaſon aſſigned for the defect of tides in lakes and ſeas, on the ſide next to the moon, in the leaſt ſatisfactory. It is found in the Encyclopedia in theſe words. "There are no tides in lakes becauſe they are generally ſo ſmall, that when the moon is vertical ſhe attracts every part of them alike, and therefore by rendering all the water equally light, no part of it can be raiſed higher than another."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="285" facs="unknown:036687_0640_100AA5C7507BCD88"/>But this explanation does not meet the difficulty. The New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonian theory ſtands on the hypotheſis that the waters on the ſide of the earth next to the moon, are more ſtrongly attracted than the adjacent land; therefore they riſe above ſeveral feet of the earth. But the ſolution above recited does not reach this point; for the waters of the ocean riſe <hi>higher</hi> than the contiguous earth; but the waters of lakes always obſerve the ſame relative altitude on their ſhores. If then the moon attracts the waters of lakes at all, or occaſions them to riſe, it attracts the adjoining earth and raiſes it in the ſame degree as the waters; but in regard to the ocean, it attracts the water and leaves the contiguous earth behind. In ſhort, if attraction and gravity have uniform laws, as we muſt believe they have, the attraction of the moon will not account for tides in the ocean, while there are none in lakes and inland ſeas.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. If the moon's attraction is the cauſe of tides, why is its force much leſs in the equatorial regions, than in the diſtant parts of the globe? It is a well known fact, that the tides within the tropics are very ſmall, and that they are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as we recede from the equator towards the poles. This is contrary to what ought to be the caſe, on the principles of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; for on the Newtonian theory of gravity, the higheſt tides ſhould be on the parts of the earth neareſt to the moon. The reverſe of this is the caſe, and the circumpolar regions of the earth have the higheſt tides. The tides within the tropics are from 12 to 24 inches—in the latitude of Greenland, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many feet.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The theory of Newton is not reconcileable with his own principles of gravity, which ſuppoſe the force of it to be equal to the quantity of matter contained in bodies. Now the theory implies that on the ſide of the earth next to the moon, the water is attracted <hi>more</hi> than the earth; but on the oppoſite ſide, <hi>leſs.</hi> This cannot be ſolved on the principle of <hi>diſtance;</hi> for this is too ſmall to account for a hundredth part of the effect. Indeed the water and the land on the ſhore, may be conſidered as at the ſame diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Nor can it be ſolved on the principle of a difference in the quantity of matter, in earth and water. If the earth, having
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:036687_0641_100AA5C95E0977E8"/>
more denſity and matter, is moſt attracted, the principle muſt act uniformly on both ſides of the earth—on both ſides, the earth muſt move towards the moon further than the water, which is contrary to fact.</p>
                     <p>If the water has moſt matter, the ſame principle muſt govern it on both ſides of the earth, and move it fartheſt towards the moon.</p>
                     <p>But here the principles of coheſion interfere with all theſe deductions. Theſe principles are ſo powerful, as to overcome the attraction of a diſtant body, nor is it to be ſuppoſed that the power of the moon overcomes the force of coheſion, and by attracting the parts of the earth next to it more than the parts on the oppoſite ſide, changes the form of the earth from a ſphere to a ſpheroid. It is not ſuppoſed that the whole ſolid maſs of the earth is continually changing its figure by means of lunar attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If ſo, this figure muſt be rotatory.</p>
                     <p>The theory then ſuppoſes that on the ſide next to the moon, the water is moſt ſtrongly attracted and riſes above the earth— but on the ſide oppoſite, it is attracted leſs than the earth. The ſolid globe is moved towards the moon, and the water left lag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging behind! What is more ſingular, the earth near the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, on the ſide oppoſite, is drawn only two feet further towards the moon than the water, or perhaps but one foot; while in the temperate latitudes, it is drawn ſix or eight feet, and in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itudes of 60 and 70 degrees, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty-five feet further than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> water. This may be philoſophy, but to me it is utterly unintelligible!</p>
                     <p>Nothing is a more ſerious misfortune to ſcience, than the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of a great man. Moſt of mankind take principles and facts upon truſt, and defend them with a zeal proportioned to their confidence in the man who has publiſhed them. I revere the character of Newton, of Kepler and of Haller; but this vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration does not in the leaſt incline me to receive their doctrins without being convinced that they are well founded. After moſt careful inveſtigation, I am ſatisfied, that the principles of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, will not account for the tides oppoſite to the moon, nor for the difference between the height of the tides in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:036687_0642_100AA5CB0D616658"/>
latitudes. Yet I have not the leaſt doubt, that moſt of the phenomena of tides are regulated by the moon.</p>
                     <p>If I was aſked, on what principles the tides depend, my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer would be, <hi>I do not know.</hi> But numerous facts, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the ſame point, lead me to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> the vibrations of the ocean to depend on electricity, influenced by the moon, the ſun, or other diſtant orbs, and acting by repulſion as well as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; or by increaſing and diminiſhing the elaſticity of the water.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, it is agreed among philoſophers, that the air, when free from vapor, is an electric; that when cold, it is moſt electric, and when heated, it becomes a conductor; and conſequently that the atmoſphere in the torrid zone is always in a conducting ſtate, while the air of the northern regions, if clear, is an electric. In ſhort, it is agreed that the atmoſphere of the temperate and frigid zones contains more electricity, than that of the torrid zone.</p>
                     <p>Theſe facts correſpond with the phenomena of tides. In the regions, where there is the leaſt electricity, there is the leaſt intumeſcence of the ocean—thoſe are the equatorial regions. There, the temperature of the air alſo ſuſtains very ſmall varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo does the height of the ocean. As we recede from the equator cold and electricity increaſe; ſo does the elevation of the tides.</p>
                     <p>Again, the ſame train of phenomena attend the barometer. Within the tropics, the variations of the mercury in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, are very ſmall; but in the temperate and cold regions, they are more conſiderable, and increaſe as we recede from a warm to a cold and electric atmoſphere.</p>
                     <p>Similar phenomena attend the twilight. Within the tropics, the twilight is of much leſs duration, than in cold regions. "Heat, ſay philoſophers, diminiſhes the air's refractive power and denſity, and cold increaſes both. The horizontal refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are near one third leſs at the equator, than at Paris."</p>
                     <bibl>Ferguſon's Aſtron. 97.</bibl>
                     <p>The denſity of the atmoſphere, within the tropics, may be leſs than at the polar circle; but the weight is nearly the ſame, the barometer being in general as high at the equator, as in north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:036687_0643_100AA5CE78945830"/>
latitudes. But the air, in hot climates, has leſs powers of refraction; that is, there is more power of refraction in an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere that is moſt perfectly electric, or that contains moſt electricity.</p>
                     <p>It is remarkable alſo that, in equatorial climates, the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere exhibits no viſible ſtreams of electricity; as it does in the polar circles.</p>
                     <p>I know not how far this parallel may be extended; but there is a ſurpriſing reſemblance between all theſe phenomena. In general then we obſerve that in the equatorial regions, the den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, weight, elaſticity and temperature of the atmoſphere, are more nearly uniform, than in northern climates; and the eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ocean in tides correſponds with this uniformity. As we recede from the equator, the variations of the atmoſphere increaſe, and ſo do the variations in the height and depreſſion of the water.</p>
                     <p>From theſe phenomena a ſuſpicion ariſes, that the medium by which the moon and ſun act upon the ocean, is the electrical fluid; as their influence appears to be in proportion to the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity of the atmoſphere. Hence the higheſt tides at a diſtance from the equator, where the heat and cold and elaſticity of the air are ſubject to great variations.</p>
                     <p>By what law, it will be aſked, is this effect produced? I readily confeſs my ignorance. But the phenomena of oppoſite tides ſeem to bear a great affinity to the well known laws of electricity, <hi>attraction</hi> and <hi>repulſion,</hi> and a <hi>poſitive</hi> and <hi>negative</hi> ſtate. I pretend not to account for the phenomena, for I am perſuaded that the experiments on electricity which man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making, will never unfold <hi>all</hi> its properties, nor explain <hi>all</hi> the laws by which this energy of nature is exerted in the government of the material ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>But the influence of the planets on the elements of this globe has, in all ages, been a ſubject of belief or of deriſion; and ſurely it is a ſubject in phyſics much more intereſting to man, than many ſpeculative queſtions which cannot affect his health and happineſs, but which occupy the labors of inveſtigating minds. I will therefore throw together a few obſervations
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:036687_0644_100AA5D001CB2AE0"/>
which may afford light on the ſubject; or at leaſt may excite a ſpirit of enquiry.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, it is generally known and admitted that the influence of the ſun and moon upon this globe are in proportion to their proximity. The higheſt tides are when the moon is in her perigee, and in conjunction with the ſun, and eſpecially when the earth is in her perihelion, or neareſt to the ſun. But the moon exerts more than uſual influence on the atmoſphere, in other poſitions. Her power is greateſt in her perigee and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee, and in her conjunction and oppoſition to the ſun. Her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the tides, under the combined and ſeparate operations of theſe circumſtances, has been fully illuſtrated. But her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on vegetation, on the viciſſitudes of weather, on health, and the phenomena of the electrical fluid in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, ſeems to have paſſed unobſerved, or at leaſt, to have never been reduced to any thing like ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>One of the moſt ſtriking effects of lunar influence, is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in earthquakes, which uſually happen near the time of the moon's perigee or apogee, conjunction or oppoſition. As this fact ſeems to have eſcaped obſervation, I will here inſert proof of it.</p>
                     <p>The great earthquake which demoliſhed Lima on the 28th day of October 1746, happened ſix hours before the full moon, and the day before her apogee.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe two laſt inſtances, according to another almanac, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened <hi>one</hi> day after the perigee and apogee. I have not taken pains to enter into <hi>exact</hi> calculations of the moon's place, as I do not deem it material. It is ſufficient for my purpoſe that <hi>almoſt all</hi> earthquakes happen near the time of the moon's conjunction and oppoſition, or her perigee and apogee. Of theſe poſitions, it is obvious that her perigee and apogee have much the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; and the inſtances I have examined are almoſt equally divided between theſe two poſitions. Of all the earthquakes which I have compared with the moon's place, one or two only fall in her quadratures, and at her mean diſtance from the earth. An inſtance happened on the 11th of April 1799 in Carolina. I have compared ſeveral other inſtances, which happened near the perigee and apogee, but it is unneceſſary to ſpecify them. The examples mentioned will eſtabliſh the generality of the fact, and the ſoundneſs of the principle.</p>
                     <p>On the principles of <hi>attraction,</hi> it will readily be admitted that the proximity of the moon to the earth, at certain periods of her
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:036687_0646_100AA5D3122EC130"/>
revolution, muſt <hi>draw,</hi> or excite into action and diſcharge, the electricity, of the earth. This accounts for earthquakes during the moon's perigee. But on enquiry we find a great proportion of the ſhocks take place during her apogee, when her diſtance is greateſt and her ſuppoſed power the leaſt; and not only ſo, but during her oppoſition to the ſun, when her <hi>diminiſhed</hi> influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſuppoſed to be counteracted and ſtill <hi>further diminiſhed</hi> by the attraction of the ſun. This is an important fact and deſerves inveſtigation. That the influence of the moon is the direct ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing cauſe of earthquakes, can hardly be queſtioned, after eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhing the fact, that four out of five, or a much larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, happen when ſhe is in particular parts of her orbit; but why her greateſt diſtance and her leaſt, ſhould produce exactly the ſame effects, a fact equally well eſtabliſhed, is a queſtion which can perhaps be ſolved only on electrical principles.</p>
                     <p>That the electricity of the atmoſphere and earth, is the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um by which the moon acts upon the elements of the globe, is rendered probable by another fact. I poſſeſs the exact dates of very few volcanic eruptions; but by comparing ſuch as I have, with the moon's place in her orbit, I find theſe eruptions begin or ſuffer violent exacerbations, at the time the moon is in her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigee or apogee; or in her conjunction or oppoſition.</p>

                     <p>The great eruption of the ſame volcano in 1794 was announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on the night of the 12th of June, nine hours before the full moon, by a violent earthquake. The eruption took place on the 15th.</p>
                     <p>The darkneſs in Canada, on the 15th and 16th of October 1785 was on the days next preceding the full moon and her peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee. The obſcurity on the 9th of that month was near the quadrature.</p>
                     <p>The eruption of Heckla in 1766 began on the 15th of April, the day before the moon's apogee.</p>
                     <p>The great eruption of Veſuvius and the earthquake, which bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Herculaneum, on the 1ſt of November A. D. 79, were the ſecond day after her perigee.</p>
                     <p>The influence of the moon in producing ſtorms of rain, ſnow and wind, is univerſally admitted; and that theſe happen near the poſitions of the moon already deſcribed, no man will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to deny. The Weſt-Indians expect hurricanes only near the time of the full and new moon; or her perigee and apogee. This is further evidence that the electrical fluid is the inſtrument of theſe commotions in the atmoſphere. Electricity is known to be the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſe of winds, and its agency is viſible in producing hurricanes; for experienced ſeamen foretel a hurricane by the unuſual tranſparency of the water. Now it is a well known fact that electricity poſſeſſes the ſingular property of giving tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parency to opaque bodies.</p>
                     <p>A little before a hurricane in the Weſt-Indies, ſeamen can ſee the lead, at an unuſual depth; the ſea alſo ſwells and rolls upon the ſhore in a ſingular manner, tho the air is perfectly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil. An efferveſcence alſo or bubbling is obſerved in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Dark clouds are formed, and the atmoſphere, before the tempeſt, is obſerved by vapors ſenſibly mephitic. See a letter from Gov. Ellis, dated March 6, 1789, in the 9th vol. of Muſeum, 215. Hence we obſerve the correctneſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying among ſeamen, that "hurricanes come out of the
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:036687_0648_100AA5D8B7A04F88"/>
ſea." They are evidently generated by extraordinary diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of electricity. Hence they are moſt frequent in the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward iſlands, which are all volcanic; ſome of them ſtill diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fire and ſmoke at times, and all of them evidently reſting on a volcanic baſe.</p>
                     <p>Further, that electricity is the great agent in theſe agitations of the elements is rendered probable by the coincidences in time, between the more violent hurricanes, and great volcanic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges from Etna, Veſuvius and Iceland. Witneſs the terrible hurricanes of 1747, 1766, 1772, 1780, 1784 and 5, all of which happened near the time of great eruptions from the volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes mentioned; all of which are diſtinguiſhed in the annals of the Antilles, and ſtill recollected with horror by the inhabitants. And this circumſtance is no inconſiderable evidence, that the agent in volcanic eruptions, as well as in hurricanes, is electrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that this element is often diſturbed or ejected from the whole globe, nearly at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>Moſt of the great tempeſts, in all latitudes, happen near the moon's perigee and apogee; and in theſe poſitions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e obſerve eſſential changes in the temperature of the atmoſphere. I have taken ſome pains to compare the changes in heat and cold, with theſe poſitions of the moon, with a view to learn, whether the effects are uniform. On examining the ſtate of the thermometer for two years, I find that, in almoſt every inſtance of the moon's perigee and apogee, eſpecially in winter, there was a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble change of temperature. Uſually the weather grew colder, as the moon approached her perigee. But the effects were not uniform; ſometimes the weather became more temperate, at the perigee. But one general remark will be found true; that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to heat and cold, the moon's apogee and perigee produce, at different times, preciſely the ſame effects. This remark ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords with what has before been obſerved in regard to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes.</p>
                     <p>It is a general remark that the weather becomes cooler as the moon approaches the change. Should this remark prove to be well founded, the reſult would be this principle, that the cold is increaſed, or rather the heat leſſened, by the combined influence
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:036687_0649_100AA5DAECCB7BC8"/>
of the ſun and moon. This principle would accord with another obſervation juſt made, that the weather is cooler, during the moon's perigee, which is generally true in winter. That is, the greater power is exerted by diſtant orbs on our atmoſphere, the more the heat is diminiſhed. But this obſervation is not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true. It is true that our winter occurs during the earth's perihelion; but this is uſually explained on the principle of the obliquity of the ſun's rays—a ſolution that perhaps is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſatisfactory, altho, to a certain degree, it is doubtleſs juſt.</p>
                     <p>It is a popular opinion that vegetation is leſs rapid, and the fleſh of animals leſs firm and ſubſtantial, and new ſhooting plants leſs vigorous, during the wane of the moon, than during her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement. This opinion is too general and too reſpectable, to be conſidered the fruit of ignorance and credulity.</p>
                     <p>Ariſtotle alleges that the cloſe of the lunar month is cooler than the other parts of it; and that during the decreaſe of the moon, the bodies of living animals poſſeſs leſs heat than at other times. De gener. animal. lib. 2. 4. Theſe remarks, whether true or not, coincide with the modern popular opinion juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
                     <p>We are apt to neglect the opinions and practices of barbarous nations, and to hold in contempt the knowlege of ancient na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This often happens, I ſuſpect, becauſe we are leſs wiſe, than thoſe whom we affect to deſpiſe. Ceſar in his firſt book of the Gallic war, chapter 40, relates, that the ancient Germans, who were great obſervers of the phaſes of the moon, declined engaging in battle, during the wane of that planet. He had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered battle to Arioviſtus, but this commander declined a general action, and permitted only ſkirmiſhes. Ceſar enquired of his priſoners the reaſon of this conduct, and was told that it was cuſtomary with the Germans to conſult their venerable matrons, who, by means of lots and divination, pronounced on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of giving battle; and theſe had declared that it was not poſſible for the Germans to conquer, if they engaged in action before the new moon. "Non eſſe fas Germanos ſuperare, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>We have this cuſtom of the Germans preſented to us, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed with ſuperſtition; but I ſtrongly ſuſpect it had its origin in the obſervation of the fact, mentioned by Ariſtotle, that in the decreaſe of the moon, animal bodies have leſs heat and vigor.</p>
                     <p>I am the more inclined to believe this, becauſe the doctrin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords with modern obſervations concerning the invaſion of fevers, and eſpecially of epidemic diſeaſes. Many medical authors concur in the fact, that diſeaſes more generally attack the human body on the ſecond or third day before the new or full moon. On examining the accounts of ſeveral writers, I find the times of invaſion to be two or three days before or after the new and full moon, or about the time of its conjunction with the ſun. See Jackſon, Grainger, Lind and many other authors.</p>
                     <p>Diemerbroeck is explicit on this point. He relates that in the plague of 1636, "two or three days before and after the new and full moon, the diſeaſe was more violent; more perſons were ſeized at thoſe times, than at others; and thoſe who were then ſeized, almoſt all died, in a very ſhort time. Many patients who appeared before to be ſlightly affected, <hi>neſcio qua virium labefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione oppreſſi,</hi> ſays the author, by an unaccountable decline of ſtrength, ſunk and died in a few hours."</p>
                     <bibl>De peſte, page 9.</bibl>
                     <p>From the obſervations of phyſicians it then appears, that this debility of the animal powers takes place near the time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and oppoſition of the ſun and moon; near the moon's perigee and apogee; and in the ſame poſitions in which earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes and ſtorms more generally occur.</p>
                     <p>Of the reality of this effect of the elements on the body, there can be no rational doubts. About the time of the change of the atmoſphere, which indicates an approaching rain or ſtorm, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of debilitated habits of body, perceive the change, by a loſs of vivacity, dulneſs or heavineſs; parts of the body that have loſt their natural energy by means of wounds and tumors expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience painful or uneaſy ſenſations, by which ſtorms are often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="296" facs="unknown:036687_0651_100AA6546F1FA110"/>Fowls perceive this change in the atmoſphere, and manifeſt their ſenſations. Candles ſparkle and ſnap; the tallow melts more freely, and the flame is leſs ſteady. Theſe things were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Ariſtotle and Pliny.</p>
                     <p>This change in the atmoſphere is not only perceptible by the ſenſe of feeling, but becomes viſible. Diſtant objects ſeen over water, and ſome writers ſay, over land alſo, <hi>loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Perſons in full health are not ſenſible of theſe changes in the elements; at leaſt, they are not ſo much affected, as to obſerve them. But from many years obſervation, I am convinced, that the catarrhal affections, which paſs under the popular name of <hi>colds,</hi> are occaſioned by the alterations in the atmoſphere which precede changes of weather, and few of them from the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cold. I know this to be the caſe with myſelf; thoſe phaſes of the moon, which have been mentioned as producing great effects on the earth and atmoſphere, rarely paſs, without affecting me with ſlight catarrh. This has been remarkably the caſe, ſince the fever of 1798, which left me in a ſtate of debility. But many perſons can atteſt the truth of the principle; nothing being more common than for perſons to remark, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell how they took cold; and it being well known that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhs are more general and ſevere, on the tranſitions from cold to heat, than from heat to cold. The obſtruction of the glands is evidently the effect of an inſenſible change in the atmoſphere, probably by means of the decompoſition of the electricity and the vapor or other elementary ſubſtances of the atmoſphere. And the winds to which we aſcribe the changes of weather are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably an <hi>effect,</hi> rather than a <hi>cauſe</hi> of thoſe changes.</p>
                     <p>Theſe alterations in the atmoſphere appear to have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the tides; or rather with the cauſe of tides. It is ſaid by ſeamen and other obſervers of the ſeaſons, that full tides are apt to produce rain; that rain which begins at high water will ceaſe, with the receſs of the tide; but rain beginning at low water, will be of conſiderable duration. Theſe and other obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:036687_0652_100AA5DFEE446410"/>
if juſt, manifeſt an influence of the tides over the ſtate of the atmoſphere, or a dependence of both on one common cauſe—the ſame inviſible energy of electricity producing both effects.</p>
                     <p>It is a known fact that the flowing tide often brings with it a breeze of wind. This is aſcribed to the friction of the water on the air, and the cauſe aſſigned may be ſufficient to account for the phenomenon. But it may be ſuggeſted whether the electricity of the atmoſphere, may not produce both the tide and the wind. The intumeſcence of the ocean, previous to earthquakes and hurricanes, which are evidently occaſioned by electricity, ſeems to bear a great analogy to the tides and to authorize my ſuſpicions. The ſwell of the ocean during earthquakes, has uſually been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the raiſing of the land beneath it; but this cannot be the cauſe, for ſuch a ſwelling of the land never takes place over whole continents. The ſwell of the water is probably the effect of the elaſtic powers of the electricity diſcharged, operating on the water itſelf.</p>
                     <p>There are many diurnal and periodical phenomena, which are evidently connected with the lunar and ſolar influence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e mentioned in this place.</p>
                     <p>It is a well aſcertained fact, that in the tropics, where the weight of the atmoſphere is ſubject to very ſmall variations, the barometer uniformly riſes and falls with the tides, about two thirds of a line. Encyclop. <hi>art. wind.</hi> This is a ſmall varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But,</p>
                     <p>It is alſo aſſerted that, in thoſe regions, "the variations in the gravity of the atmoſphere ſeem to depend on the heat of the ſun, as the barometer conſtantly ſinks near <hi>half an inch</hi> every day, and riſes again to its former ſtation in the night." Ency<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clop. <hi>art. atmoſphere.</hi> [I ſuſpect the words "half an inch" to be an error.]</p>
                     <p>Now, if the barometer depends, for its fluctuations, on heat, we ſhould ſuppoſe the ſame cauſe would operate in northern lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itudes, and occaſion a diurnal riſe and fall, in an exact ratio to heat and cold. In this caſe, a barometer would be a thermom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:036687_0653_100AA5E22EA60C10"/>
reverſed; riſing with augmented cold and ſinking with an increaſe of heat. But this is not the fact. The barometer often riſes with the increaſe of heat, between ſun-riſe and twelve o'clock. Heat therefore cannot be the direct cauſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal depreſſion of the barometer in the equatorial climates; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it has different laws, in different latitudes, which philoſophy will not admit.</p>
                     <p>Let us compare the facts ſtated with the known phenomenon of the different forces of water, during the day and the night. The water-wheel of any mill, the altitude of the water and the reſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance being preciſely the ſame, makes more revolutions, in a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute, during the night, than in the day time. I have long been acquainted with the fact, and it is known to every miller; but as I have never ſeen a ſtatement of it in any philoſophical work, I have had the curioſity to make an accurate experiment to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the difference. This was done on the night after the 28th of May 1799; the weather being perfectly ſerene, the air free from vapor, not a breath of wind ſtirring to ruffle the water, and the barometer, on the evening preceding, at half paſt eight, ſtanding at 30 and one tenth.</p>
                     <p>The firſt obſervation was made at a quarter before 7 P. M. ſometime before ſun ſet, the thermometer ſtanding at 65 deg. when the wheel of the mill made exactly 16 revolutions in a minute. The altitude of the water was marked with preciſion; but the delivery of the water not having been exactly adjuſted to the current entering the pond, the water roſe, and at 9 o'clock had half an inch of altitude beyond the mark. By this means, my obſervation at that hour was loſt. By raiſing another gate, the water was reduced to its former altitude, and by twelve o'clock the diſcharge of the water was exactly equal to the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and from that time to ſunriſe, the altitude continued the ſame.</p>
                     <p>At twelve o'clock and from that hour to three, the wheel made 17½ revolutions in a minute; the obſervations being often repeated, without a ſenſible variation of reſults. Soon after three o'clock, a ſmall acceleration was perceptible, but it did not amount to half a revolution, until about half paſt three, when
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:036687_0654_100AA5E3B8115520"/>
the wheel made 18 revolutions in a minute, which accelerated movement continued till half paſt four, when, being near ſun riſe, the obſervations were diſcontinued. During the laſt obſervations, I perceived a very ſmall retardation of movement, but it did not amount to half a revolution. To prevent any difference of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in the mill, not the ſlighteſt alteration was made in the elevation of the ſtone, or the quantity of wheat delivered from the hopper, from the beginning to the end of the obſervations.</p>
                     <p>I had not a barometer with me at the mill, but about eight o'clock, on the following day, the barometer ſtood about one twentieth of an inch higher, than on the preceding evening. The thermometer fell, during the night, to 54 deg.</p>
                     <p>From this experiment, it is obvious that the weight of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere could not be the ſole cauſe of the acceleration of the wheel. The acceleration at twelve o'clock was almoſt an <hi>elev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enth</hi>—at a later hour, a <hi>ninth</hi> of the whole movement. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed gravity of the atmoſphere will not account for a tenth of the difference.</p>
                     <p>We muſt then reſort to other principles for a ſolution of the phenomenon. It is commonly ſuppoſed that water is a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compreſſible ſubſtance; but this opinion has been juſtly queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. However this may be, I have little heſitation in reſolving the phenomenon of the water-wheel into its increaſed elaſticity during the night. How or why the ſubduction of light and heat ſhould produce or increaſe this property in water, I leave for electricians to determin. The effect cannot be aſcribed to the increaſed gravity of water, during the night, for no ſuch increaſe is obſerved.</p>
                     <p>It is an obſervation of ſeamen that ſhips make more way in the water, by night than by day, with the ſame force of wind. I ſhould ſuſpect that the moiſture on the ſails might, in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, contribute to this effect; but it muſt be recollected that in rainy days there is no difference in the moiſture of the air by night and by day. Can the effect then be aſcribed to the cauſe that accelerates the movement of water-wheels by night—an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed elaſticity? If the gravity and denſity of water were augmented during the night, theſe would render the water more
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:036687_0655_100AA5E5E70BC9E0"/>
buoyant, but retard the motion of a ſhip, by increaſing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. We are therefore driven to the ſame hypotheſis, an increaſe of elaſticity, which renders water more buoyant when at reſt, and more impreſſive when in motion, without an augmented denſity and weight. But I am not ſure that the moiſture of the air will not account for the whole effect.</p>
                     <p>If the elaſtic power of water is increaſed by the abſtraction of heat, does it not follow that this power muſt be greater as we recede from the equator; and of courſe, any given force applied to the water in different latitudes, will occaſion a vibration of that fluid, proportioned to its elaſticity. Hence the ſmall tides within the tropics, where the heat is nearly uniform; and the high tides in the northern regions, where the vibrations in the temperature of the atmoſphere, are more conſiderable. Yet facts do not permit us to aſcribe this elaſticity to cold. It is more probably owing to the quantity of electricity, or to its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar combination with aerial ſubſtances, of which cold is the effect. Perhaps the following obſervations will throw ſome light on this ſubject. Ariſtotle and after him, Pliny aſſerted that no animal dies, except during the ebb tide. "Nullum animal niſi aeſtu recedente expirare. Obſervatum id multum in Gallico O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceano, et duntaxat in homine compertum." Pliny, Nat. Hiſt. lib. 2. 98. "No animal dies, except during the receſs of the tide. This is particularly obſerved on the coaſt of Gaul; and is at leaſt true with reſpect to man."</p>
                     <p>The firſt part of this obſervation is probably too general; but modern facts confirm the aſſertion, within certain limitations. A late miniſter at Barrie in Scotland, contiguous to the German ſea, made a ſimilar remark, after fifty years obſervation.</p>
                     <bibl>Sinclair, vol. 4. 240.</bibl>
                     <p>The reaſon why Pliny has ſpecified the coaſt of France, as remarkable for the fact ſtated, is very obvious. France lies on the main ocean, and the time of high and low water is the true time. On the coaſt of Italy, where there are no tides, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation could not be made; and if made by the time of ebb tide in rivers and bays, it would not be juſt.</p>
                     <p>Another remark made by phyſicians, is, that <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi>
                        <pb n="301" facs="unknown:036687_0656_100AA5E89C5791C8"/>
more perſons die during the latter part of the night, than at any other time in the ſolar day. This remark has not come to me from a ſufficient number of obſervations to command full belief; but it accords with a few obſervations of my own. If univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true, it would contradict in part the remark of Ariſtotle and Pliny; but it is poſſible, both remarks may be true with certain limitations. The fact may be more obvious, when ebb tide hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens between midnight and ſunriſe; and leſs ſo, when flood tide happens at that period; that is, under the combined or ſeparate operation of the two cauſes.</p>
                     <p>Other facts lend their aid to ſupport the obſervation that ſome eſſential change in the properties of the atmoſphere takes place, in the latter part of the night. This is the time when all fevers remit or intermit. The exacerbations and paroxiſms of fever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the patient, during ſome part of the day, and ſubſide in the latter part of the following night.</p>
                     <p>Again. The chills that precede fevers uſually come on in the ſame part of the day, that is, between midnight and ſunriſe. This is remarkably the caſe with epidemic diſeaſes, as all phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians agree. The fact has been aſcribed to the debility induced by ſleep; but I ſuſpect it is owing to the debility induced by the ſame change in the ſtimulant powers of the atmoſphere, which occaſions the other phenomena before mentioned.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable alſo that ſleep, in the latter part of the night, is more ſound, than at other times; an effect perhaps of the ſame cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Lind obſerves that in the Eaſt-Indies, patients generally expire at low water—the ſame fact is obſervable at the full moon—and convaleſcents uſually relapſe at theſe periods. See his Treatiſe on the diſeaſes of hot climates. p. 86.</p>
                     <p>From experience I can teſtify that relapſes uſually occur, at thoſe periods of the lunar month, when changes of weather take place.</p>
                     <p>Ulloa was careful to note the time of the tide when earthquakes occurred in South-America, and he found them invariably to happen at half ebb or half flood—never at high or low water.</p>

                        <pb n="302" facs="unknown:036687_0657_100AA5EABAABCA68"/>There are other periodical changes in the atmoſphere which deſerve notice. Great ſtorms of wind, ſnow and rain, uſually begin, abate and ceaſe at certain hours, viz. at ſix, nine, twelve and three o'clock; eſpecially at ſix and twelve. To this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark there are very few exceptions.</p>
                     <p>Experienced accoucheurs inform me that in lingering caſes of child-bed illneſs, paroxiſms of pains recur at the ſame hours.</p>
                     <p>What is ſtill more extraordinary, we are aſſured by unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able authority, that in volcanic eruptions, the diſcharges are more violent at theſe hours, than during the reſt of the day. Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Hamilton, in his excellent account of the great eruption of Veſuvius, in June 1794, has the following paſſage. "The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the mountain, as had been remarked in former eruptions, ſhowed itſelf to be, in ſome meaſure, periodical, and was gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally moſt violent, at the break of day, at noon and at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night."</p>
                     <bibl>Univ. Magazine for Auguſt, 1795.</bibl>
                     <p>Theſe are the hours when we obſerve great changes in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, and ſudden effects on the human body in diſeaſes. The break of day is preciſely the time when the water-wheel is moſt accelerated—when fevers remit or intermit, and when the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, lingering under diſeaſe, ſuddenly yields, and ſinks into his grave.</p>
                     <p>To what cauſe ſhall theſe effects be aſcribed? Not to lunar or ſolar attraction, in the uſual ſenſe of the word. Attraction is conſidered as a ſteady principle operating uniformly under the ſame circumſtances; and therefore the attraction of the moon, whoſe poſition in regard to the earth is every day changed, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not account for periodical phenomena, at certain hours in the day. The influence of the ſun will better ſolve the phenomena; but how can the ſame principle, attraction, operating by uniform laws, produce the ſame effects at two oppoſite hours, for inſtance at noon and at midnight, which certainly is the caſe in regard to the exacerbations of volcanic eruptions, as well as in regard to the commencement, abatement, and termination of ſtorms?</p>
                     <p>I do not know that any principle yet diſcovered will ſolve the difficulty. But the phenomena bear a greater analogy to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations of electricity, than to any other principle in nature hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:036687_0658_100AA5EC446FC1E8"/>
diſcovered. It ſeems neceſſary to invite to our aid repulſion as well as attraction, producing in oppoſite points, the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. The nature and operations of electricity are little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and probably will never be brought wholly within human comprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>It is to be wiſhed that experiments on the revolutions of water-wheels, in different latitudes, may be made, with care and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, to aſcertain whether any acceleration at night takes place within the tropics, and if ſo, whether it equals the acceleration, in northern latitudes. And alſo whether the acceleration is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the latitude of 60 deg. than in the latitude of 40 deg. Our millers ſay that water has more force in winter, than in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. This may be eaſily aſcertained by experiment</p>
                     <p>We are enveloped in a maſs of fluids, whoſe combinations are in a continual proceſs of change. The energy of action ſeems to depend on electricity—or the principle of light, heat and fire; but I am perſuaded that the manner in which changes are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, is very little underſtood.</p>
                     <p>I will cloſe this lengthy article by obſerving that the phenomena of lunar and ſolar influence are ſo well underſtood and clearly proved, as to juſtify in our minds, the great attention which the ancients paid to the influence of the planets on this globe. If they went into one extreme, by aſcribing too much to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, the moderns have erred, on the other extreme, by holding their doctrins in contempt.</p>
                     <p>The ſun is the great ſource of light, and his rays excite the heat which exiſts in and around the globe. It moves this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal principle, which conſtitutes the energy of the material ſyſtem, under the control of infinite intelligence.</p>
                     <p>The moon is placed in the vicinity of the earth, to give vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to the ſeaſons, and by acting on the elementary principle of heat, ſhe occaſions the viciſſitudes of rain, ſnow, fair, calm and tempeſtuous weather. The changes which precede and produce theſe viciſſitudes appear to be variations in the combinations of heat or electricity, with the other elemental principles of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. Theſe modifications of the atmoſphere, without any acceſs of new matter or diminution of its maſs, produce differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:036687_0659_100AA5EE8A19FFA0"/>
in its denſity and elaſticity, with all their various effects on the animal and vegetable ſyſtems. Hence a mere modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or new combination of electricity, with vapor or other ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſubſtance, may increaſe or diminiſh its ſtimulus—during the day, it may excite fever in the human body; during the night, a ſubduction of excitement in the atmoſphere, may induce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and favor the invaſion of diſeaſe and the approach of death. Theſe are mere hints and conjectures, intended to excite inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to the ſuppoſed influence of comets on the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this globe, I would remark, that on the principles here ſuggeſted, that influence is very clearly proved and may be eaſily underſtood. The facts ſtated demonſtrate that the ſun and moon exert great powers on the globe; and the fact that earthquakes moſtly happen in certain poſitions of the moon, prove that the <hi>medium</hi> of her influence is the electric principle.</p>
                     <p>Now comets are known to be of various magnitudes. Some of them are as large as Venus; much larger than the moon; with highly electrified atmoſpheres; and ſometimes approaching near to the earth. The comet of 1577 came within leſs than a million of miles diſtance.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe comets which paſs the ſyſtem at an immenſe diſtance from the earth can have no great influence; but others approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near, produce tremendous effects. Hence during their proximity to the earth, the number and violence of earthquakes and volcanic diſcharges; tempeſts, inundations from rains and extraordinary tides; and moſt ſenſible changes in the powers of animal and vegetable life. That ſuch are the effects, is proved not only by the concurring opinions of all the ancient philoſophers, who were accurate obſervers of nature, but by one uniform ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of hiſtorical evidence, for more than two thouſand years. On the principles of electricity, which is diſturbed, attracted, repelled and modified in its combinations with other ſubſtances, by the approach of diſtant bodies, the ſolution of the phenomena is eaſy and philoſophical.</p>

                     <p>SOME modern philoſophers ſuppoſe that the earth contains vaſt quantities of fire, which is the ſource of the principal part of the heat on the earth, the cauſe of vegetation, of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and of hot ſprings.</p>
                     <bibl>See Buffon, and Darwin's Botanic Garden. Additional Notes, p. 145. New-York edition.</bibl>
                     <p>There are ſome reaſons to believe that particular parts of the earth abound with fire, or maſſes of burning lava. This opinion is ſupported by the iſſuing of ſmoke from the craters of certain volcanoes, for years in ſucceſſion, without any eruption of fire.</p>
                     <p>But the theory which aſcribes earthquakes to ſteam or vapor, appears to be very unſatisfactory. How can ſteam be collected within the bowels of the earth, ſufficient to ſhake a continent of 3000 lengths in extent? If a great quantity of water ſhould by accident fall on a maſs of burning lava, the effect would not be a general equable ſhake or concuſſion, over a whole quarter of the globe, which ſometimes happens in earthquakes; but a violent ſhake at the place of contact, and a diſrupture of the earth, by which the force of the ſteam would be ſuddenly diſcharged into the atmoſphere. This however is not the fact. Almoſt all earthquakes in North-America are progreſſive; beginning in the interior of the country and proceeding towards the ocean, in a direction perpendicular to the line of ſhore, that is, from north-weſt to ſouth-eaſt. Perhaps we can find a ſatisfactory ſolution of this phenomenon, upon electrical principles; but no cauſe can be found in the known properties and effects of ſteam.</p>
                     <p>One of the arguments uſed to maintain the theory of ſteam, is derived from the known fact that ſprings and ſtreams are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhauſted by extreme drouth, ſome time antecedent to earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes and volcanic eruptions. But the fact, inſtead of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the theory, operates to deſtroy it.</p>
                     <p>The hypotheſis ſuppoſes that, at certain times, the ſprings in the vicinity of burning lava deſcend and fall upon it; and the
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:036687_0661_100AA5F326126DF0"/>
water being raiſed into ſteam and extremely rarefied, expels the burning materials in volcanoes with great violence; and in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, the force of the ſteam alone aſcends and ſhakes the earth.</p>
                     <p>But why ſhould the water of the ſprings find paſſages to the lava, at ſome times and not at others? If the paſſages were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways open, the water would always deſcend. If they are open at particular times only, there muſt be ſome ſubterraneous force exerted to open them, before the water comes in contact with the fire; the effect then or diſrupture, muſt take place, in a certain degree, before the ſuppoſed cauſe can operate. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the force exiſts anterior to the diſrupture which brings the water in contact with the fire. This concluſion ſuperſedes the uſe of vapor.</p>
                     <p>But by what magic does it happen that all the ſprings and rivers in the neighborhood of a volcano for inſtance, diſappear about the ſame time? By what mutual conſent, can this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able phenomenon be produced? And why, after the eruption, do all the ſprings and rivers reſume their former channels? Is it poſſible to ſuppoſe thouſands of paſſages, ſcattered over many leagues of earth, to be all opened at once, to convey ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean ſprings to a particular place, a few months anterior to an eruption of fire; and after the eruption, to be all cloſed at on; and the water compelled to run its former channels? Yet all this muſt be admitted on the theory of ſteam.</p>
                     <p>That large volumes of water are ſometimes thrown into the baſons of volcanic mountains and ejected, it true; but, in ſuch caſes, the diſrupture is occaſioned by a previous earthquake or force of fire, and the water is diſcharged in maſs; not in the form of vapor.</p>
                     <p>It is a fact authorized by all hiſtory and obſervation, that great earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are often, if not uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, preceded by ſevere and univerſal drouth. This drouth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten extends over whole continents; and I find that the defects of water which occaſion the terrible famins in Egypt, India and China, of which we have many accounts, happen generally, (and I ſuſpect always,) a few months before and during ſome
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:036687_0662_100AA5F4E390F330"/>
great diſcharges from volcanic mountains. I have certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that this failure of rain and ſprings ſometimes occurs ten months before the eruption. This was the fact in Bengal in 1769—and in America in 1762 and 1782. At other times, the drouth happens during the eruption, and in ſome caſes, it is continued for two or three years, in which eruptions take place in different parts of the work.</p>
                     <p>The drouth, on ſuch occaſioned is not occaſioned ſolely by a failure of rain, but by the concurring influence of exceſſive evap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oration. This fact is capable of demonſtration. Sir William Hamilton, Univ. Mag. Aug. 1795, in his account of the erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Veſuvius in 1794, informs us that ſome days previous to the diſcharge, the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ountain at Torre del Greco began to decreaſe, ſo that the corn-mill worked by it moved ſlowly. In the wells of the town, the water f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ll and it was neceſſary to lengthen the ropes daily. Some wells became quite dry. In a vineyard, near the town, ſome perſons were alarmed, eight days before the eruption, by a ſudden puff of ſmoke and exploſion from the earth.</p>
                     <p>It is recorded that P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>tycides foretold an earthquake in Greece, from a ſudden failure of water in a well. Theſe facts indicate unuſual evaporation.</p>
                     <p>It is obſervable alſo that the exhauſtion of water extends, in ſuch caſes, to a greater depth than uſual. The earth, below the uſual influence of the ſun's heat and of rains, loſes its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral moiſture. Such probably was the caſe in 1782, when the cedar ſwamp in New-Jerſey took fire and burnt to the depth of many feet. And this is probably what Livy meant, when, in ſpeaking of the terrible drouth in Rome, before the great erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Etna, B. C. 426, he uſes the words "ingenito humore egens"—a failure of native moiſture.</p>
                     <p>In the vicinity of volcanoes, this evaporation may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for on the principle of ſubterranean heat, which is ſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, ſome time before an eruption. But this ſolution cannot apply to countries a thouſand leagues diſtant, which ſuffer extreme evaporation, at the ſame time.</p>
                     <p>There appears <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

but by the great principle of action, electricity. Indeed the diſcovery of the fact, that moſt earthquakes happen under par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular phaſes of the moon, and that volcanic eruptions are obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly affected by her poſition in her orbit, ſeems to place this point beyond queſtion.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems then to be very certain that the electricity which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts in and about the earth is eſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>fluenced by the ſun, moon and planets, but eſpecially by the larger comets; which paſs near the earth. The influence of theſe bodies, or the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial laws of the univerſe, diſturb this fluid and vary its diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and its combinations with other ſubſtances.</p>
                     <p>Previous to earthquakes, volcanic diſcharges and hurricanes, it is evident from many phenomena already enumerated, the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity of the earth paſſes out of it in unuſual quantities; and as the air is often a bad conductor, the fluid acce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to it and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries along, the water upon the ſurface and within the bowels of the earth. This proceſs continued for ſome weeks and months, exhauſts all the rivers and ſprings. The atmoſphere, in the mean time, becomes more and more dry, and a worſe conductor, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til both air and earth become perfectly electric, or non-conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. In this ſituation, either a great demand for the fluid in ſome diſtant region, or a great accumulation of it in the bowels of the earth, has prepared the way for a ſudden exploſion, but no conducting medium exiſts, ſufficient to convey it. A fall of rain, at this time, may create that medium; and hence the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fact that earthquakes happen ſoon after rain, ſucceeding ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere drouth. If no rain falls, the fluid accumulates, till it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a paſſage through the great apertures, formed for the purpoſe, the volcanic mountains, ſetting fire, on its way, to the hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene, and other inflammable ſubſtances, which the ocean gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates or depoſits in their boſoms.</p>
                     <p>I know not that theſe concluſions are juſt, but the facts from which I reaſon, are indiſputable. The uncommon diſcharges of electricity, <hi>previous to theſe great concuſſions,</hi> are indicated not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the exhauſtion of ſtreams and ſprings but by many phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena in the atmoſphere, ſhowing it to be highly electrified. Meteors, huge globes of fire, ſhoot through the air, not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

but <hi>before</hi> the eruption. Witneſs the meteors of 1758, 1762, and one in May 1783, mentioned in the preceding hiſtory. And Sir William Hamilton informs us that the air was unuſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged with electricity, ſome days before the eruption of 1794.<note n="*" place="bottom">May not the appearances of certain epidemic diſeaſes of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis be aſcribed to this too highly electrified, and of courſe, ſtimulant ſtate of the atmoſphere? The influenza of 1708 was prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a meteor or fiery globe. In 1758 was a meteor and the meaſles began in America. In 1771 a meteor, and then commenced influenza and meaſles.

More facts and obſervations than I poſſeſs are neceſſary to ſettle this queſtion.</note> Unuſual halos and mock ſuns, fiery and luminous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances in the heavens, with extraordinary tempeſts, and hail, are evidences of the ſame fact.</p>
                     <p>The idea that the heat which we experience exiſts in and about the globe, is undoubtedly well founded. The ſun is prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the great electric of the ſyſtem, which excites into action the heat of the atmoſphere and the earth; but there is no reaſon to believe that heat is principally derived from that body. The ſolar rays conſtitute a very ſmall part of the heat of the earth; but they excite it by the rapidity of their motions, or by decom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that which exiſts in the air and earth.</p>
                     <p>Hence there appears to be little foundation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the opinion, that the inferior planets which are neareſt to the ſun, have more heat, than Saturn and Jupiter. If heat is diminiſhed in the ratio of the ſquares of the diſtances from the ſun, it is on the principle that heat conſiſts in ſolar rays; but this is a very queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable doctrin. Light is a ſubſtance, but does not neceſſarily contain heat; at leaſt not any that is perceptible.</p>
                     <p>It is probable, that if the ſolar rays falling on Saturn are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed in number, according to the doctrin of diverging lines, that this defect is ſupplied by an increaſe of denſity or ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of excitement, in the atmoſphere of that planet. The denſity and capacity of being excited may be in a direct propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſolid contents of the planet, or in a duplicate ratio to

                        </gap>e. Hence the larger planets are placed at the greater diſtance, And on this principle there is no ground to calculate, as Newton has done, the extreme heat which comets acquite in their perihelion. No ſubſtance of which we have any knowlege, could ſuſtain the intenſity of heat which, he has calculated, the comet of 1660 muſt have received. It is more conſonant to the general arrangement of the univerſe, as far as our limited underſtandings can comprehend it, to ſuppoſe none of the great orbs that roll in infinite ſpace, are either over heated or over cooled. Every orb has probably its own fund of heat, and the capacity of being excited, ſuited to its place and deſtination. The planets, the comets in the parts of their trajectories moſt remote from the ſun, and even the ſun itſelf, may be inhabited.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>I take this opportunity, in diſcuſſing the queſtion concerning the origin of heat, to notice what philoſophers have ſaid on the ſubject of the internal heat of the earth. Darwin, in his Botanic Garden, note 6, alleges the earth below the depth of about ten feet, to be always of the ſame temperature, which is 48 deg. by Farenheit. He cites Dr. Franklin's obſervation, that ſpring water at Philadelphia is of 52 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which, he ſuppoſes, a proof of internal heat from central fires. For as the climate of North-America is colder, than that of England, he could not account for the exceſs of heat in the water at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, beyond that of England <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>t by preſuming it to be occaſioned by internal fires. Yet in another paſſage, in note 7, the author intimates that he had an idea of a difference of heat in different latitudes, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the action of the ſolar rays. Yet I cannot find any European author who appears to have had a correct idea of this ſubject; and Mr. Jefferſon, in his Notes on Virginia, query 5, has manifeſted his ignorance of it, by a moſt egregious miſtake. Speaking of a cave in Frederick county, he informs, that the thermometer, which ſtood at 50 deg. in the open air, roſe to 57 deg. in the cave. He then adds the following remark, "The uniform temperature of the cellars of the Obſervatory of Paris, which are 90 feet deep, and of all <hi>ſubterranean cavities</hi> of any depth, where no chymical agents may be ſuppoſed to produce a factitious heat, has been found to be 10 deg. of Reaumer, equal to 54½ of Farenheit. The temperature of the cave above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſo nearly correſponds with this, that the difference may be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to a difference of inſtruments."</p>
                           <p>It ſeems a little ſtrange that ſo groſs an error ſhould have paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrected, till this late age, on a point of fact ſo eaſy to be aſcertained.</p>
                           <p>The truth is, the temperature of the earth, below the diurnal and annual influence of the ſolar rays, which may be perhaps ten feet in ſolid earth and 30 feet in open wells, is regulated by the proximity of place to the equator, ſubject to ſmall variations, from the poſition of the place in regard to the ocean and the height of the land.</p>
                           <p>But what is remarkable, this temperature of the earth and water in the anterior of the globe, is preciſely the <hi>mean temperature</hi> of the climate, in the place where the obſervation is made. Thus, let the higheſt and loweſt points be taken daily by any good inſtrument, and divide the ſum of all the obſervations by the number of days in the year, the quotient will be the mean temperature of the climate, and preciſely the temperature of the water, below the variations of heat and cold. If any difference ſhould be found, it muſt be owing to inaccuracy in the obſervations. It is more uſual to take three obſervations daily; at 2 o'clock P. M. the warmeſt time in the day, at ſun-riſe the coldeſt time, and at ſun-ſet, which is found to be the mean temperature. By obſervations made in the city of New-York for one year, I found the mean temperature to be 53½; but this is 1½ degree too high; owing to an exceſs of heat <hi>within the city,</hi> beyond the general temperature of the climate. The air in a city cools leſs at night, than in the country, and hence the morning obſervations were found to be too high. In many inſtances, ice as thick as glaſs was formed a mile from New-York, when an accurate thermometer in the city fell no lower than 40 deg. Hence the great error of determining the temperature of a climate, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations made in a large city; which is often done in Europe.</p>
                           <p>The mean temperature of the climate in England, is 48 deg. That of Paris, 54½. This difference is owing to the inſular ſituation of England; the atmoſphere in the vicinity of large tracts of water being always more temperate, than on continents at a diſtance from the ſea or great lakes.</p>
                           <p>The following is the mean temperature of the climate of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective places, aſcertained by obſervations.</p>

                           <p>Allowing a triſle for differences of inſtruments, this table preſents to view the various mean temperatures of the climates mentioned.</p>
                           <p>From this table naturally ariſe two obſervations. Firſt the great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the climate in Europe and America, under the ſame parallels of latitude. Thus London in 51 degrees north, has a mean temperature, almoſt as mild as Hartford in 41, Paris in the 49th de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree has a climate, nearly as mild as the northern parts of Virginia in the 39th, and warmer than New-York and Philadelphia in the 40th.</p>
                           <p>Again we obſerve the great effect of the ocean upon the climate. Salem in Maſſachuſetts is upon the ſea ſhore, and Rutland, in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, fifty or ſixty leagues diſtant; and one degree of latitude differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the poſition of the places; yet the climate at Rutland it 3½ degrees colder than at Salem. On the other hand, Quebec, remote from the ſea, tho on a river, with three degrees difference of northern latitude, has a difference of only 1½ degree in climate.</p>
                           <p>To aſcertain the mean temperature of any given place, it is only neceſſary to plunge a good thermometer into water, taken from a depth, in which the temperature it uniform, at all ſeaſons of the year.</p>
                           <p>The mean temperature of water within the tropics it not exactly known, but it muſt be very near 80 deg. by Farenheit. Water drawn from a depth of 200 feet in the Weſt-Indies, it <hi>cooled</hi> by filtration in the air, above the earth in thoſe hot regions.</p>
                           <p>The difference in the temperature of Europe and America under the ſame parallels, is nearly that of ten degrees of latitude.</p>

                     <p>With theſe known principles in view, let any man calculate the velocity of vapor, driven from the nucleus of a comit, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to preſerve a direction nearly oppoſite to the ſun, in its perihelion paſſage.</p>
                     <p>Comets enter the ſolar ſyſtem in various directions; the planes of their orbits making various angles with that of the ecliptic. Their orbits are nearly elliptical, and the ſun is in one of the foci of the ellipſis.</p>

of comets muſt be very rapid in their perihelion. The comet of 1770 was calculated to deſcribe an arch of 50 degrees in 24 hours. This ſeems hardly credible; but many comets deſcribe an arch of 180 degrees, a ſemi-circle, in 30, 40, or 50 days.</p>
                     <p>The perihelion diſtances alſo of the various comets are very different, and ſo are the lengths of their tails; ſome of them extending a ſmall diſtance, and others to 60 and 80 millions of miles.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe the perihelion diſtance to be 30 millions of miles, and the length of the coma to be 70 millions. In this caſe the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the tail muſt be 100 millions of miles from the ſun. Now, either the vapor which is ſuppoſed to conſtitute the tail, muſt be ſhot from the nucleus with ſuch rapidity, as to reach the extreme point of the coma, in a few hours; that is, it muſt paſs through 70 millions of miles, in a very ſhort time, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a direction nearly oppoſite to the ſun; or the whole coma muſt move forward with the nucleus. In the latter caſe, the extremity of the coma muſt paſs along the periphery of a circle,<note n="*" place="bottom">The figure would not be a circle, but it is not material to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</note> whoſe radius is a line from that point to the ſun, or 100 millions of miles. Of courſe while the comet deſcribes an arch equal to a ſemi-circle, the extremity of the coma muſt paſs through the ſpace of 150 millions of miles. I believe no kind of vapor of which we have any knowlege, could perform either of theſe journeys in the time given.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand that gravitating ſubſtance would not have paſſed thro the diſtance ſuppoſed, from the creation of the world to this time.</p>
                     <p>On ſubjects of this kind, we cannot arrive at certainty. All we can do is, to reaſon from analogy and from probable conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We know of no ſubſtance in creation, capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the phenomena of the comas of blazing ſtars, except electricity or light. No other ſpecies of matter paſſes with a rapidity that will ſolve the phenomenon of the length of the coma preſerved in a direction oppoſite to the ſun. The theories of Kepler and Hamilton are more rational, than that of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:036687_0669_100AA605BA32AE80"/>
The tails muſt conſiſt of electricity repelled from the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleus by the force of the ſun; or muſt be merely the rays of light colored by their paſſage thro the comet's atmoſphere. Theſe hypotheſes may not ſolve <hi>all</hi> the phenomena; but they will account for the principal; and are repugnant to no philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical principles.</p>
                     <p>The curvature of the coma has been alleged as an objection to this hypotheſis. But in fact this is a confirmatory argument in favor of it; for it is analagous to the curvatures formed by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending ſtreams of electricity in the lumen boreale; indeed it ſeems to be a law of electricity to move in bending lines; and for any thing we know, this phenomenon may reſult from the nature of that ſpecies of matter, and be independent of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                     <p>In regard to the tranſparency of the tail, it reſembles alſo the lumen boreale. Thro both of theſe luminous appearances, the ſtars ſhine with undiminiſhed luſtre; but vapor, however rare, would refract their light, and in a certain degree, interrupt our viſion.</p>
                     <p>An Eſſay on Comets by Andrew Oliver, publiſhed 1772, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the tails of comets to air extremely dilated and repelled from the nucleus by the power of the ſun; but this hypotheſis is liable to all the objections ſtated againſt the theory of Newton.</p>
                     <p>My own opinion reſpecting the material ſyſtem, is this; that an atmoſphere, the baſis of which is electricity, fills infinite ſpace and involves in its boſom all the ſolid orbs which ſhine in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial regions. This may be denominated the <hi>mundane atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere.</hi> My hypotheſis reſts on the following reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt. The large meteors or globes of fire are formed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions far beyond the limit aſſigned to the earth's atmoſphere. Their altitudes vary from 40 to 80 miles. At the height of 80 miles, then, there muſt be the matter of an atmoſphere, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, of generating globes of fire of half a mile in diameter; and of communicating ſounds, as full and diſtinct, as the air near the earth; for the exploſion of one of thoſe globes reſembles thunder.</p>
                     <p>Secondly. The lumen boreale has been often calculated to be viſible at an elevation of 7 or 800 miles. I do not rely on

the accuracy of theſe calculations, on account of the difficulties attending them. In ſome inſtances we are very certain that this light exiſts in the regions of the higher clouds.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly. The tails of comets muſt be matter, or depend on matter for their coloring by which they become viſible. In ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe we have evidences nearly amounting to demonſtration that a material atmoſphere fills the boundleſs regions of ſpace.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly. But an argument of ſtill more weight in my mind, is one drawn from the neceſſity of ſuch an atmoſphere, as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of attraction and repulſion—the principles that connect and bind together the vaſt orbs that roll in etherial regions. I can have no idea of ſuch an immenſe power exerted in an immenſe void or vacuum.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems probable that the parts of our atmoſphere which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute weight, and are ſuppoſed to influence the barometer, are limited to the diſtance of a few miles from the earth. Water, for inſtance, is a ſubſtance deſtined to anſwer certain purpoſes on the globe, and is probably confined to its neighborhood.</p>
                     <p>But the principle of electricity may be, and undoubtedly is, a nongravitating and permanently elaſtic ſubſtance. This may be diffuſed through infinite ſpace, and by its amazing elaſticity, may be capable of communicating motion or force from planet to plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, with the rapidity of light.</p>
                     <p>Newton ſuppoſed infinite ſpace to be filled with a ſubtle ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which he called <hi>ether.</hi> Had this great man been acquainted with the laws of electricity diſcovered ſince his days, he probably would have exchanged the term ether, for <hi>electricity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By means of this powerful principle, the planets all influence each other; and become the means of diverſifying each other's ſeaſons; ſometimes by attracting, ſometimes by repelling, and ſometimes diſturbing the proportions of this ſubſtance, or influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing its mechanical laws, by which it is combined or decompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with other atmoſpheric ſubſtances.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may account for the frequency of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and violent tempeſts, under particular phaſes of the moon, and eſpecially during the proximity of comets. The electrical matter accumulated in the earth by its own laws, or by reaſon of an unuſual demand a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of theſe orbs, be ſuddenly called into action, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion extraordinary tumults in the atmoſphere.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps alſo we may, in this hypotheſis, find a ſolution of the phenomenon, ſo intereſting to man, and ſo myſterious, why the approach of comets never fails to be attended with epidemic diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. The fact in regard to comets which come near the earth, it unqueſtionable; and it is equally certain that earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, volcanic eruptions, meteors and many other electrical phenomena, are, at ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> more numerous and violent, than at other times.</p>
                     <p>Now it is proved by experiments that the fibres of living ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are the moſt perfect conductors of electricity, while the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teguments which cover them are non-conductors. A conſequence of theſe principles muſt be, that in all the motions or operations of electricity in the atmoſphere, the nerves muſt be the principal ſubjects of its influence. Hence if the atmoſphere is, at times, electrified beyond the degree which is uſual, and neceſſary to preſerve the body in a due ſtate of excitement, the nerves muſt be too highly excited, and under a continued operation of undue ſtimulus, become extremely irritable, and ſubject to debility. Shall we not find, in this hypotheſis, a rational ſolution of the phenomenon which has puzzled medical men, the exceſſive irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of the nervous ſyſtem, in times of epidemic diſeaſes, which facilitates the invaſion of fever? Shall we not account for the eruptive diſeaſes which always precede peſtilential epidem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics, on the principle of the great debility of the extreme veſſels, induced by the weakneſs of the nerves which ſpread over the human body near the ſurface, by which means theſe veſſels are rendered incapable of performing their uſual ſecretions? Shall we not be able to account for the remarkable coincidences in time between the influenza, and unuſual electrical phenomena, as volcanic eruptions and earthquake? May we not account for epidemic meaſles, in thoſe years when the atmoſphere ſhows ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idences of high electrification? And will not this principle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the diſeaſes among animals, the defect of vegetation, and the extraordinary generation of inſects, during peſtilence? It is well known that vegetation may be greatly accelerated by artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial electricity. Is this effect produced by what is called <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement</hi>?
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:036687_0672_100AA60C916D97F8"/>
And if ſo, how do we know that a ſimilar power, operating on the elements, may not call into exiſtence innumeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſects? To what other principle ſhall we aſcribe the <hi>unuſual ſize</hi> of common inſects, when they precede and accompany peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence, a fact well atteſted? There muſt be a cauſe for theſe phenomena, and where ſhall we find it, but in the univerſal principle of excitement?</p>
                     <p>It is now agreed among philoſophers that electricity is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate agent in the formation of rain, ſnow and hail. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this theory, my enquiries into the cauſe of epidemic diſeaſes have led to a diſcovery, that thoſe years when volcanoes diſcharge great quantities of fire and lava, including ſome months before and after the diſcharges, are by a great difference, moſt productive of hail. Hence the immenſe damage done by hail-ſtorms in thoſe ſeaſons which are exceſſively dry and hot; theſe years being cloſely attendant on volcanic eruptions. The theory which aſcribes hail to extreme cold is defective. We know that pieces of ice of three, ſix and even nine inches in circumference ſometimes fall in hail-storms. By the laws of gravity, a hail-ſtone muſt begin to fall, as ſoon as it begins to be formed; and as it requires but a few ſeconds to deſcend, it is eaſy to conceive that mere cold cannot occaſion a congelation rapid enough to form pieces of ice of half a pound weight. The proceſs is elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical, and almoſt inſtantaneous; and we know that real ſnow may be artificially and inſtantly produced by means of condenſed air and electricity. Hence we are led to the cauſes which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect ſevere winters with volcanic eruptions; we derive the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme heat of ſummers and cold of winters, which ſo generally accompany peſtilence, from the ſame cauſe, a ſuper abundance of electricity.</p>
                     <p>Hence we are led alſo to the cauſe of the apoplexies, lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies and eruptive diſeaſes, which almoſt uniformly follow great volcanic diſcharges and earthquakes in Italy. The ſyſtem, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the nerves, are exceſſively excited, and loſe their energy.</p>
                     <p>It is on the ſame principle alſo that we explain the phenomena of freezings when the thermometer is above the uſual point of froſt. This has been obſerved near volcanic mountains, where the atmoſphere is highly charged with electricity. In 1730,
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:036687_0673_100AA60EC7DD5610"/>
Dr. Cyrillas found by a thermometer made by Haukſbee, that water, near Veſuvius, froze with the mercury 10 degrees above the freezing point.</p>
                     <bibl>Phil. Tranſ. No. 424. Bad. Mem. vol. 9. 299.</bibl>
                     <p>The nature of this element, electricity, is little underſtood. It is the modern opinion that heat and light are only modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame element. This is analogous to what we know of water, which exiſts in the form of water, of viſible vapor and air.</p>
                     <p>It is ſuppoſed that electricity cannot be inſulated in the human body. But if it cannot be inſolated in the form of <hi>electricity,</hi> may it not in the form of <hi>heat,</hi> and thus be the direct cauſe or matter of inflammation? If it can be accumulated and inſulated in this form, may not conductors be formed to draw it off in the form of electricity? Mr. Vinal relates that he ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved local inflammation occaſioned by a burn and ſcald, by the application of a negatively charged electrical machine.</p>
                     <bibl>Mem. Amer. Acad. vol. 2. 144.</bibl>
                     <p>Should this doctrin be well founded, the ſucceſs of metallic points in removing topical inflammation, will be explained and eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>The proofs of the altitude of the atmoſphere from the power of refracting light, are now known to be fallacious. No man will ſuppoſe the atmoſphere to be leſs elevated, in the equatorial regions, than in the polar circles; yet the duration of twilight, under the equator, being leſs than in places remote from it, proves that the power of refraction will not determin the height of the atmoſphere. The power of refraction is in a ratio to the diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heat, or increaſe of cold, in the atmoſphere; or perhaps to the increaſe of electricity.</p>
                     <p>Nor will it be correct to ſay that the power of refraction de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the denſity of the atmoſphere, unleſs denſity can exiſt independent of gravity. The atmoſphere in the polar and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate regions raiſes the barometer no higher, than under the equator; nor is the mercury in barometers generally higher in winter, when the thermometer, by Farenheit's ſcale, is 20 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees under cypher, than in ſummer when it is at 98 deg. the temperature of blood heat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="319" facs="unknown:036687_0674_100AA6104E8D47E0"/>If denſity implies or involves in it gravity, then the atmoſphere at the equator is as denſe as in any diſtant latitude, for the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometer is as high in one as in the other. But if the atmoſphere it as denſe and as heavy, caeteris paribus, in one latitude, as in another, then the powers of refraction, in different latitudes, which are various, cannot depend on denſity.</p>
                     <p>It is indeed very queſtionable whether denſity and gravity are the principles which wholly influence the barometer. The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometer falls, as it is elevated above the ſurface of the earth; but the atmoſphere retains all its powers of ſuſtaining reſpiration and circulation, at an altitude of 15,000 feet.</p>
                     <p>What are the aerial phenomena that attend a fall of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometer? How can the weight of the maſs of air ſurrounding the globe, be ſuddenly taken off, over a whole continent? What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of its gravity, and the principle of attraction on which it is ſuppoſed to depend? Are they removed, expelled, or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended?</p>
                     <p>I ſuſpect the theory which aſſigns to the barometer the province of determining the gravity of air, is fundamentally defective; and that inſtead of variations in its <hi>weight,</hi> it indicates only va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations in the combinations of its parts, which diverſify its <hi>elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> and its operation on the barometer, as well as on the human body. When the atmoſphere is full of vapor, the barometer uſually falls, and we feel a depreſſion of ſpirits. It can handly be true, that the preſſure of the whole atmoſphere is leſs, at ſuch a time, than when the air is clear and the barometer high; for this vapor circulates near the earth and the higher regions of the air are as clear and as ponderous as uſual. If the denſity of the air near the earth ſhould be leſſened, the conſequence muſt be the air from higher regions which retains its gravity, muſt inſtantly ruſh in to ſupply the defect.</p>
                     <p>The only way to account for the variations of the barometer, appears to be on the principle before mentioned. The air appears to be leſs elaſtic, when the heat is combined with vapor, and the mercury falls. It ſeems neceſſary to take into view theſe conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations in order to ſolve the phenomena. The general preſſure of the atmoſphere or gravity, is probably uniform, and it is
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:036687_0675_100AA611E04AD498"/>
the various changes in its elaſtic powers, which occaſion the vibrations in the barometer.</p>
                     <p>Every dairy woman knows that thunder and lightning will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſtantly coagulate milk; that is, when electricity is united with vapor, and paſſes, in a viſible form, from cloud to cloud, or between the clouds and the earth, <hi>milk turns,</hi> or coagulates— ſo it does, during a rainy day, in ſummer, without thunder, with the thermometer at 64 deg. as I know by obſervation. This condition of the atmoſphere, may be called its <hi>decompoſed</hi> ſtate. The barometer falls, vapor becomes viſible, the functions of the body are languid, milk coagulates, objects contract mould, in ſhort the atmoſphere is unelaſtic, and ill-fitted to maintain vigor in animal or vegetable bodies.</p>
                     <p>Thus alſo the fermentation of beer is checked and deſtroyed by thunder, and no human art has been found to reſtore it. By what proceſs of electricity is this ſudden change effected?</p>
                     <p>I have remarked in the preceding pages, that a peſtilential at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere is not corrected or moved by the force of wind—no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt expelling an epidemic fever from a city, unleſs at the cloſe of the ſeaſon, and accompanied with heavy rains. How can we ſolve this difficulty, but upon the hypotheſis of an electrical atmoſphere which it ſtationary?</p>
                     <p>Dr. Franklin proved that "an electrified cork ball at the end of a ſilk thread, whirled never ſo rapidly through the air, for a length of time, loſt none of its electricity. He found alſo by an experiment that an electrical atmoſphere raiſed round a thick wire, inſerted in a phial of air, drives out none of the air; nor on withdrawing that atmoſphere, would any air ruſh in." On Electricity, Lond. ed. 97. It is alſo proved that a moſt violent blaſt of wind, thrown acroſs a ſtream of electrical matter, has not the leaſt effect upon it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe experiments prove that air furniſhes no ſenſible reſiſtance to the motion of electricity, and that it exiſts in air without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panding or compreſſing it. In ſhort it proves that electricity acts entirely by its own laws, and is not controlled by the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the air.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="321" facs="unknown:036687_0676_100AA61578FF1468"/>Will not theſe obſervations throw light on the fact of a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary atmoſphere in caſes of peſtilential epidemics? Is not electricity the baſis of the common atmoſphere, and immoveable by wind? And does not a peſtilential air conſiſt partly in ſome combinations of this element, with other aerial ſubſtances, which are not moved by wind? This is ſuggeſted merely for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; for it appears to me improbable. Froſt deſtroys the peſtilential condition of the atmoſphere, and this is ſuppoſed to act upon the deleterious ſubſtances ariſing from the earth, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body. Beſides, a peſtilential atmoſphere riſes but a few feet above the earth, which indicates that its pernicious qualities are denſe and gravitating ſubſtances.</p>
                     <p>Indeed two cauſes ſeem to concur in the origin of peſtilential fevers—an electrical condition of the atmoſphere which renders the nervous ſyſtem extremely irritable, and the body of courſe prone to fever; and a collection of morbid matters ariſing from living<note n="*" place="bottom">I mention the morbid matters from <hi>living</hi> bodies, among the cauſes of peſtilence. I am perſuaded that perſpiration in cities furniſhes more poiſon than ſtreets and alleys. It fills all cloſe rooms, eſpecially bed rooms; in cloſe-built ſtreets, it infects the very atmoſphere; and a more virulent poiſon does not exiſt, than perſpirable matter in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed and fermenting ſtate. This can only be deſtroyed by a liberal uſe of water.</note> and dead animals, and putrefying vegetables. Wind may remove the latter cauſe, if acceſſible, which however is never the caſe in large cities; but cannot affect the influence of the former. Froſt has acceſs to all morbid cauſes, and renders them inert. It alſo reduces the ſtimulus acting on the human body, and renders it leſs irritable. But the electrical ſtimulus remains. Hence altho the progreſs of the fever is arreſted by cold, the type of it is viſible in the diſeaſes of the winter. The irritability of the ſyſtem, from electrical cauſes, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains; and gives to the fevers of winter the peculiar ſymptoms of peſtilential or typhus pleuriſy, and peripneumony.</p>
                     <p>A remarkable property of electricity is to give polarity to the needle of a compaſs. A violent ſtroke of electricity, deſtroyed the virtue of the loadſtone, and reverſed the ends of the needle of the compaſs on board of Capt. Waddell's ſhip in 1751; and a ſuitable diſcharge of that element will give polarity, like the
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:036687_0677_100AA61A51EF6A58"/>
magnet. Hence it is concluded that magnetiſm depends on electricity, but in what manner, ſeems to be myſterious.</p>
                     <p>It is well known that the needle is ſubject to variations, which are different in different parts of the earth; and in ſome degree, periodical. It has alſo a ſmall diurnal variation; receding from the eaſt or <hi>influence of the ſun</hi> from 8 o'clock in the morning to 2 in the afternoon; and from the weſt, or the ſame influence, from 2 o'clock to 9 P. M.; and during the night, remaining ſtationary. Is not this owing to the repulſion of light and heat? If ſo, is there not an analogy between this diurnal variation, and the phenomenon of polarity? If light and heat, falling on one ſide of the needle, repel it in a ſmall degree; is it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to conclude that the equatorial heat, ſhould repel the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic point, and direct it to the north? That is, the needle points towards that portion of the atmoſphere which is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly electric.</p>
                     <p>It may be objected that the needle does not always direct it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the ſame point. True; but there is ſome periodical revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the electricity of the terreſtrial regions; as the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and diſappearance of the lumen boreale, at certain periods, warrants this ſuggeſtion. It ſeems to be admitted that there is a current of electricity from the equatorial regions towards the polar regions, within the earth, and in the upper parts of the atmoſphere, a current of the ſame element from the poles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the equator. This idea is derived in part from the lumen boreale, and receives countenance from the fact, that a bar of iron, ſtanding directed towards the pole will acquire polarity or magnetic properties; but directed towards other points in the heavens, no ſuch effect is produced; indicating a ſtream of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectricity paſſing through the bar, from the center of the earth towards the pole, but not in any other direction.</p>
                     <p>Should this idea be well founded, and ſhould it be admitted that the lumen boreale is a current of electricity from the north to the ſouth, will not the periodical appearance and diſppearance of this light, indicate a revolution in that current about the axis of the earth, or perhaps an axis of its own? If ſo, on what laws does it depend, and how will it agree with the variations of the compaſs?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="323" facs="unknown:036687_0678_100AA6183954C5E8"/>It will be ſaid, that the variations are different in different places, and not uniform in the ſame place. True; but the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral courſe of variations in the ſame place is tolerably uniform.</p>
                     <p>With reſpect to different degrees of variations in various pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I have one obſervation that is probably new. It is very probable, if not evident, that the <hi>diſtributions</hi> or <hi>forces</hi> of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity are different in different quarters of the globe. I ſay <hi>diſtributions</hi> or <hi>forces;</hi> for a difference in the ſtate of exiſtence or modes of acting, will as well account for the phenomena, as difference in quantity. My reaſons for this opinion are, that the barometer has different altitudes, in different places, at the ſame time. The mean altitude for a month or a year, in places of the ſame elevation, is very various. Hence we conclude that the weight of the atmoſphere cannot be the cauſe of theſe varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for this on a level of the ocean, muſt, on hydroſtatic prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, be every where the ſame. Yet the actual differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to one half or two thirds of an inch.</p>

                     <p>It is eaſy to account for this difference of preſſure on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of different combinations of the electric principle with vapor or other local matter in the atmoſphere, which may vary the <hi>force</hi> or elaſticity of the air; but I do not ſee how the <hi>weight</hi> of a fluid alone, whoſe preſſure muſt be equal, if of equal height and den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, can account for theſe differences. It is utterly repugnant to all known principles of the equable preſſure of a gravitating fluid, to ſuppoſe a mere change in the form or compoſition of that fluid, ſhould alter the abſolute weight. Water admits none of theſe varieties, being always of equal denſity and gravity at equal altitudes.</p>
                     <p>On the ſame principle of a difference of preſſure or elaſticity in air and water, without a change of weight, perhaps we may account for the very different elevations of the tide in different places, and in ſome inſtances, in the ſame latitude. It is rational to conclude that the electricity is various in its combinations or quantity, in different places, according to the heat of the climate, the neighborhood of land and high mountains, or perhaps to the ſeats of volcanoes? The fact that tides do not riſe as high, on the main ocean, as near land, ſeems to countenance this idea.

                     <p>Another fact that ſeems to favor the hypotheſis that electricity is the inſtrument of tides, is, the great irregularity of tides.

I ſhould not be inclined to credit theſe relations if modern obſervations did not ſerve to confirm them. On the 11th of March 1785 and 25th of January 1787, the Tiviat, a large river in the ſouth of Scotland, receded and left its channel dry, in the former inſtance, <hi>two hours,</hi> and in the latter, <hi>four.</hi> No convulſion of the earth was known in that neighborhood, nor within two or three weeks of the firſt inſtance. As earthquake happened on the 26th of January, the day <hi>after</hi> the ſecond inſtance, but could not be the cauſe. A ſimilar receſs happened on the day of the earthquake, in the river Clyde. On the 12th of September 1784, in perfectly calm weather, the water in the Lock Tay in Scotland ſuddenly ebbed 300 feet and left the channel dry, then flowed again, and thus alternately roſe and fell for two hours. The ſame phenomenon, in a leſs degree, occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in ſeveral ſucceeding days.</p>
                           <bibl>Sinclair, vol 6. 624.</bibl>
                           <p>The facts related of the ſea and rivers in Holland on the day, but not at the hour, of the earthquake, at Liſbon, in 1755, when ſhips ſnapped their cables, and water daſhed over the ſides of veſſels, without the leaſt ſenſible motion of the earth, are ſtrong proofs of the ſame inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but immenſely powerful action of the electricity of the globe. The ſwelling of the ocean in the time of earthquakes is not ſo much owing to the riſing of the earth beneath, as to the force of electricity. The intumeſcence ſometimes begins <hi>before</hi> the ſhock, as it does <hi>before</hi> hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes in the Weſt-Indies.</p>
                           <p>In Scotland, during the great earthquakes in Calabria, in 1782, the water in the locks was agitated without any motion of the earth, and the mercury in the barometer fell within the tenth of an inch of the bottom of the ſcale. On the 12th of February 1787, the barometer at Edinburgh fell nearly to the ſame point.</p>
                           <p>Theſe phenomena can be reſolved into no cauſe but ſome operation of electricity, and they add much weight to my ſuſpicions, that tides are governed by ſome laws of electricity, which are influenced by the phaſes of the moon.</p>
                           <p>The great fall of the barometer in Scotland is a ſtrong evidence that the ſame energetic principle governs that inſtrument. It is abſurd to ſuppoſe the atmoſphere could have loſt ſuch a portion of its weight. Indeed it is far from being impoſſible that the riſe and fall of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rometer may be occaſioned by the force of electricity acting on the qickſilver itſelf.</p>
                           <p>If any perſon ſhould heſitate to believe that a mere change in the combination of electricity and aerial ſubſtances, may vary the ſpring or elaſticity, without the leaſt alteration of their weight, let him attend to the different powers of wine, cyder or beer, before and after fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation begins. It is not preſumable that the liquor has more weight in a ſtate of fermentation, than when quieſcent, before that proceſs begins; yet the force with which it acts upon the caſk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, is increaſed perhaps a hundred fold. I ſuſpect that the changes in the atmoſphere which affect the barometer and the human body are analogous to what we obſerve in liquors—mere alterations in the combinations of the parts, producing various elaſtic powers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any change in the general gravity of the atmoſphere. Hence it is eaſy to conceive that the elaſtic power of the atmoſphere may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified by ſubſtances exhaled from the earth, in different ſituations; this may occaſion ſmall variations of the barometer in two diſtant places, having the ſame altitude, and be one cauſe of differences in the ſalubrity of the air.</p>
                           <p>This idea it ſtill better illuſtrated by the different properties of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder in the kernel and in a ſtate of exploſion. In the former ſtate, an immenſe elaſtic power is confined to a compaſs inconceivably ſmall —by adding to it a ſpark of fire, this elaſtic power is ſet looſe with tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous effects.</p>

To this point I have paid particular attention. They are not always attendant on earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions; but they occur in the ſame year, or near the ſame period; evidencing that when thoſe viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcharges take place, inſenſible diſcharges take place in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote countries, and on the oppoſite ſide of the globe.</p>
                     <p>Should it be admitted that electricity may be unequally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed or operate with different forces, in various places, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its combinations with aerial ſubſtances, at different times, we may find ſome probable cauſes of the great diverſity of diſeaſes in the ſame year, as well as of the different heights of the barometer. The ſtimulus applied to the human body, may be different in various places, according to the predominant ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of one or more of the following cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Soil, which may affect the air in various ways.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Situation in regard to elevation, to water, hills, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, minerals, freſh air.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The population of places, and all the conſequent evils of noxious exhalations.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. The cultivation of a country, which has a moſt ſalutary effect on the atmoſphere.</p>
                     <p>It is very certain that the condition of the atmoſphere is very different, in places which appear to be equally favorable to
<pb n="326" facs="unknown:036687_0681_100AA62164362FF8"/>
health. Children and valetudinarians are very ſenſible of theſe differences. It is hardly poſſible to remove an indiſpoſed perſon a diſtance of five miles, without a ſenſible effect on his health; be is better or worſe in his new atmoſphere. Under the combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed operation of ſuch various cauſes, we are not to be ſurpriſed at the irregularity in the appearance of autumnal and epidemic diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Much labor has been employed to inveſtigate the cauſe of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and perception. The moſt able philoſophers maintain the neceſſity of a medium through which we receive impreſſions of diſtant objects. The rays of light are ſuppoſed to be the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of viſion, and an elaſtic air, the medium of ſounds. But by what means impreſſions on one part of the body are almoſt inſtantaneouſly communicated to the other parts, may be a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of difficult ſolution.</p>
                     <p>It appears to me probable that the medium by which impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are conveyed from one object to another, is that moſt elaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic fluid, the principle of fire or electricity, which pervades eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry object and is diffuſed through creation. A motion given to this fluid in the brain is inſtantly conveyed, by its elaſtic prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, to the remoteſt fibre, and vice verſa. The ſame fluid, diffuſed through the ſolar ſyſtem, and all creation, may and probably is the medium by which diſtant orbs make impreſſions on each other.</p>
                     <p>It is abſurd to ſuppoſe that the bodies that compoſe the ſolar ſyſtem, or any other ſyſtem of worlds, can be ſuſpended in an immenſe void, and revolve about a common center, at diſtances of many millions of miles, without ſome medium of connection; ſome tie to bind them together. It is abſurd to ſuppoſe that an influence can be exerted between them, unleſs thro the medium of a ſubſtance. This ſubſtance is doubtleſs that ſubtle, elaſtic fluid which conſtitutes the baſis of fire, heat, light, or electricity. This fluid, receiving an impreſſion from one globe, in any part of ſpace, may impart it to another, in a few moments, by means of its elaſtic powers. This theory accords with the known prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties of electricity; and affords a ſublime idea of the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſtructure of the univerſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="327" facs="unknown:036687_0682_100AA62302228A10"/>The heat of a fever may proceed from the ſame fluid; and hence the value of water, as a conductor, to carry off the heat of a fever. In all fevers, this is the indication of cure given by nature. Hence the obvious and prime utility of perſpiration, in the cure of peſtilential fevers, which ſeize the very feat of life, the eſſential organs of the nervous ſyſtem—parts of the body which medicins taken into the ſtomach do not eaſily reach. Perſpiration and ſalivation, by throwing out moiſt and fluid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, thus conducting the heat or electric principle to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, ſeem to be the moſt certain remedies.</p>
                     <p>This elaſtic principle, if any thing, is the ſubſtance which has given riſe to the doctrins of galvaniſm, animal magnetiſm— and Perkiniſm. But if thoſe doctrins have any juſt foundation, the nature and modifications of the principle are ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that all attempts to reduce the doctrins to certainty or ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem have hitherto been defeated. Primary cauſes elude all the reſearches of man, and compel him to acknowlege his ignorance.</p>

                     <head>On the popular modes of guarding againſt infection.</head>
                     <p>MANKIND have, in all ages, reſorted to a variety of expedients to guard themſelves from peſtilential diſtempers, and to check them when exiſting. The uſe of aromatics as a <hi>peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> is as old as the journey of the Iſraelites from Egypt; for when the plague had broke out among them, Aaron took his cenſer, put on <hi>incenſe,</hi> and ſtanding between the dead and living, the plague was ſtayed.</p>
                     <bibl>Numb. xvi. 47.</bibl>
                     <p>Herodian relates that in time of peſtilence, the Romans ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed their noſtrils with aromatics, but without ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>Mignot relates that the Turks, at this day, make great uſe of aromatics, to guard themſelves from the plague.</p>

                     <p>Diemerbroeck chewed tobacco as a preſervative, and alleges many inſtances of its good effects. It is not improbable that this article, by promoting diſcharges of the ſaliva, may prevent the
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:036687_0683_100AA6248A44FB88"/>
noxious matter from entering the ſyſtem by the ſauces, which are principal agents in abſorbing the poiſon. Any other herb that will promote ſpitting, would probably be equally ſalutary. Waſhing the mouth frequently with freſh water is very uſeful in the ſame way; and nurſes ſhould never inhale the effluvia of the ſick, without immediately waſhing the mouth.</p>
                     <p>In our country, many ſimilar expedients are employed toward off infection. Camphor is worn in little bags around the neck, or frequently applied to the noſe.</p>
                     <p>It does not appear that aromatics and pungent ſalts have much effect in reſiſting the attacks of peſtilence. There is probably no attraction between the particles of ſuch ſubſtances and the poiſon of the plague. Stimulants are uſeful, in ſome caſes, when applied to the whole body; but applied to the noſe, their effect is local, and wholly inadequate to the purpoſe. A ſpoonful of freſh water, taken frequently into the mouth, and diſcharged, is better than a pound of camphor; for water mingles the infectious particles with its maſs, and renders it harmleſs or carries it off.</p>
                     <p>It is poſſible however that, in ſome caſes, an atmoſphere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with the ſtimulating effluvia of ſpiceries may preſerve the body from the attacks of this diſeaſe. An inſtance is related in Acta Eruditorum of the year 1721, publiſhed at Leipſic, that perſons living near ſtorehouſes of ſpices eſcaped the plague. We ſhould however be cautious of drawing concluſions from a ſingle fact. The effect may have proceeded from an unſuſpected cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Skenkius, from Alex. Benedictus, informs, that it is a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom among the Tartars in the Crimea, to kill their dogs in time of peſtilence and ſuffer them to putrefy on the earth; alleging that the fetor arreſts the plague by changing the air. Page 773. This is certainly a moſt ſingular remedy, and the fact requires good authority and explanation to induce belief. It however correſponds with ſome inſtances, in which peſtilence has been leaſt ſevere in filthy places.</p>
                     <p>The burning of powder is held to be uſeful in checking the plague, by generating reſpirable air. Lernnius, lib. 2. The blowing up of a magazine has been ſaid to put a ſtop to peſtilence.</p>
                     <p>During the civil wars in England, which ended in the death of Charles I. Fuller relates that the plague in Litchfield was
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:036687_0684_100AA626617EDC10"/>
arreſted by the firing of cannon, at the ſiege of that town. The pious author ſays that many aſcribed this to the <hi>purging of the air by the bullets,</hi> but divines aſcribed it to God's good providence.</p>
                     <p>It is related in Van Swieten that the fermentation of wines on the Moſelle, in time of vintage, had a moſt ſenſible effect in checking the plague.</p>
                     <p>It has been cuſtomary to burn reſinous ſubſtances in the ſtreets to ſtop the progreſs of peſtilence, but without any ſenſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. It was attempted in Philadelphia in 1793 and in New-York in 1795, but the ill ſucceſs has prevented a repetition of the attempt.</p>
                     <p>Authors relate that the ancient phyſicians put a ſtop to the plague, by enkindling large fires in the ſtreets. I conſider the fact as doubtful, for it is not agreed among writers, whether this was done by Hippocrates, or another man.</p>
                     <p>It was however on the ſtrength of the ſtory, that great fires were kindled in London in 1665; but the deaths were more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous on that night, than they had been before. If fire can be of any uſe in the plague, it muſt be by creating motion in a ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant air, or by drying a moiſt one. The latter effect is that which Galen ſuppoſed to have reſulted from the fires uſed by the ancients; and there may be ſituations and times, when a fire in infected houſes may be applied to good purpoſe, by removing damp ſtagnated air. But it is queſtionable whether the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere of a city can be ſenſibly and beneficially changed by public fires; and the experiment is very hazardous, for if the fire ſhould be communicated to the buildings, it would not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume property, but double the rage of peſtilence. Thus the plague in Conſtantinople in 1539 was greatly inflamed by a fire which conſumed a large part of the city. Fatigue and diſtreſs, added to the previous cauſes, multiplied the new caſes, and one third of the inhabitants periſhed.</p>
                     <bibl>Mignot's Hiſt. Turk. Emp. vol. 2.</bibl>
                     <p>Every thing which collects, fatigues and alarms people, at ſuch times, is very prejudicial; as the fire in Philadelphia, in 1793; in Providence, in 1797, and the launching of the frigate in Baltimore, in the epidemic of the latter year.</p>

But if theſe precautions prove fruitleſs, as they uſually will, and as they <hi>always</hi> will, when the diſeaſe is the effect of an atmoſpheric principle, which is the fact, nineteen times in twenty, the only certain means of ſecurity, are in quitting the city.

                     <p>It is agreed on all hands, that perſpiration, if induced on the firſt ſeizure of the patient, is the moſt effectual preſcription. Hence the univerſal uſe of alexipharmics in peſtilence.</p>

                     <p>Fallopius remarked in the plague which raged from 1524 to 1530, that all died who were bled. This was obſerved alſo by H. Florentus, a phyſician of Leyden—by Simonius, in the plague of 1602—Hildanus, in the plague at Lauſanne, and a multitude of others. See them collected in Diemerbroeck, de peſte, 130. and ſequel, who found in the plague at Nimeguen "veneſection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em damnoſiſſimam fuiſſe"—bleeding was extremely injurious.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, we have in the ſame author a long liſt of names of eminent phyſicians, who warmly advocate veneſection. To this liſt may be added the name of the celebrated Sydenham.</p>
                     <p>The ſource of this difference of opinion is doubtleſs the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the ſymptoms in the diſeaſe under different conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of air, in different places, and in different habits. The great difference in the ſame diſeaſe, under different epidemic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, was moſt diſtinctly obſerved by Sydenham; and this variety ſeems to conſtitute no ſmall nor eaſy part of the phyſician's inveſtigation.</p>
                     <p>Sydenham obſerved what is undoubtedly true, that the ſame diſeaſe is characterized with different ſymptoms, under different conditions of the air; and often the ſame apparent ſtate of air produces very different diſeaſes. It is very evident, that the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> qualities of the ſeaſons are not the <hi>only</hi> circumſtances that modify diſeaſes. The learned Boyle remarks the great diverſity in plagues, requiring remedies altogether different.</p>

                     <p>Hence at one time, the plague, in a few hours after invaſion, induces a ſtate of debility, in which bleeding will, in almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry caſe, accelerate death. At other times, the diſeaſe may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

                     <p>I am perſuaded that hiſtory will juſtify theſe remarks, and make practitioners very cautious of preſcribing for the name of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.

This vapor on an open plain ſubſides near the earth, being heavier than common air; but it fills cellars, wells and hollow places, ſo as to endanger life, and actually proves fatal to birds, beaſts, and vegetables; ſometimes to men. This vapor or fixed air is generated by the action of vitriolic acid on calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous earth; and by other means in the immenſe laboratory of Nature's works.</p>
                     <p>The facts here ſtated and which are well known to every chymiſt, will perhaps account for the <hi>damps</hi> in wells, as this fixed air is called in popular language. It is a common idea that air will become impregnated with this vapor, by mere ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in a well. This is probably a miſtake. Nor is it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any ſubſtances in the well generate this air. It cannot proceed from water, nor from the earth, or ſtones, or rocks which compoſe the ſides of the well, unleſs the earth is different from common earth. It is probable therefore that this mephitic vapor is expelled from the earth by force of internal heat or elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical fire; and that this happens not uniformly, or at any certain times. I ſuſpect that the diſcharge of it happens at particular times in various parts of the earth, from cauſes not yet explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that it occaſions epidemic diſeaſes among men, beaſts and fiſhes. To aid us in an enquiry of this kind, it would be neceſſary to examin a great number of facts, and diſcover whether this mephitic vapor is ever found in wells, except when epidemic diſeaſes of ſome ſort or other prevail among animals.</p>
                     <p>On the 30th of Auguſt 1795, juſt after the peſtilential fever appeared in New-York, two men fell victims to this vapor, in a well belonging to a brewery in Pine-ſtreet, within a few yards of the houſe where I then reſided. The well had been dug but a few months, and was not uſed, but covered over with boards. It was about 25 or 30 feet deep, contained a few feet of water, and was ſo full of mephitic vapor, that a candle was extinguiſhed within eight feet of the ſurface of the earth, as I found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. This was during the ſickneſs, and a queſtion ariſes whether the two things were connected in cauſe. Had not a ſimilar vapor been ſilently thrown from the bowels of the earth, over all the coaſt and region from New-Jerſey to Connecticut,
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:036687_0689_100AA63325032C88"/>
for ſome months previous? And may not the ſickneſs of the oyſters and ſhad on that coaſt, from 1794 to 1796, as well as the deſtructive epidemic angina, fevers and dyſentery, be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that cauſe? I offer this hint to excite enquiry. Gov. El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, in a paper on the ſubject of hurricanes, Muſeum, vol. 9. 215, mentions, among the precurſors of thoſe tempeſts, thick vapors in the air "ſenſibly mephitic." If this vapor is the cauſe of diſeaſes, it will account for the greater prevalence of them in low ſituations.</p>
                     <p>There is reaſon to ſuſpect that this mephitic air is expelled from the earth, in conſiderable quantities, at particular times, but incorporating itſelf with the common air, it does not often prove fatal to men, altho it may leſſen the vital powers of the atmoſphere, and aid in the production of diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>In 1729, on the 19th of July, a Mr. Adams of Boſton and his ſervant periſhed by this air in a well. Let it be obſerved that in this year, the influenza ſpread over Europe. Whether it was in America or not, I cannot learn; but the meaſles was epidemic in Boſton, in that year; and other parts of America were ſickly.</p>
                     <p>But what among other things inclines me to the opinion that this ſpecies of air is not generated gradually in wells, but is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from the earth ſuddenly, is a fact related in the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with the foregoing, Baddam's Mem. vol. 9. 4. Phil. Tranſ. 411; that on the 9th of May preceding this accident, two men at work in a well in School-ſtreet, Boſton, were ſuddenly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by this ſpecies of vapor, and came near loſing their lives. The well had recently been dug and enlarged, the workmen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing no inconvenience; and that the vapor did not proceed from opening a new chaſm, or breaking a new ſtratum of earth or minerals, is certain; for the men were not the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> digging, but ſtoning the ſides of the well.</p>
                     <p>In Philoſophical Tranſactions, No. 119, it is ſaid that damps are generally obſerved to come about the end of May, and to continue during the heat of ſummer. At that ſeaſon alſo they are moſt violent in mines infeſted with them, during the whole year. But by a ſubſequent paragraph, it appears that the writer
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:036687_0690_100AA634CC45C4F8"/>
in that remark made no diſtinction between fixed air and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.</p>
                     <p>If it is true that this vapor is expelled from the earth in ſpring and ſummer only or principally, to what cauſe ſhall we aſcribe that circumſtance? Not to internal heat certainly, for that at the depth of 20 feet is always the ſame. We may perhaps find a ſolution in the excited atmoſphere of ſummer, which may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion diſcharges of electricity.</p>
                     <p>It might be well for the world, if experiments were made to aſcertain theſe points. If a vapor is at times thrown into the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere from the internal parts of the earth, and becomes nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to health, it is of great conſequence to the world to know the fact, as this air ſubſides into the lower grounds, and might often be avoided. A deep covered well and not uſed, might be kept for this purpoſe, and a lighted candle or lamp let down to its bottom once a month. If there had been a diſcharge of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitic air, it would be found in the well; but if the air of the well ſhould be found good, we might conclude that the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere had received no taint from ſubterranean vapor.</p>
                     <p>This ſubject deſerves inveſtigation. The herbage is at times affected by a dew or clammy ſubſtance, which is viſible, tangible and offenſive to cattle. Inſtances have been related in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding hiſtory. The honey-dew is a curious phenomenon, not well underſtood. This is a ſubſtance that reſembles honey or wax, depoſited on the leaves of trees, and attaching itſelf to blades of corn. It is ſweet to the taſte, and the honey-bee is ſeen to feed upon it. To corn it is very prejudicial, by cauſing a blaſt.</p>
                     <p>I have not been able to aſcertain whether this is a periodical or an accidental phenomenon, nor to find the cauſes of it in the known properties of air or water. Is it the produce of a vapor from the earth; or of ſome unuſual combination of aerial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances?</p>
                     <p>We live in a fluid, compoſed of various ingredients, each of which has its own properties, and by various combinations, and inceſſant changes, theſe ingredients are daily generating new prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties. One day, the ſky is calm and cloudleſs; the next, the

heavens are wrapped in vapor, and the earth deluged with rain. One moment, we are ſhrouded in chaotic darkneſs; the next preſents to us the heavens and earth in a ſheet of livid flame. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous is the tranſition from the ſilence of the grave to peals of thunder that ſhake the earth beneath our feet; and the field that ſmiles with its golden fruits, to day, is to-morrow torn with the raging tempeſt, ſtripped of its beauties, and converted into a barren waſte.</p>
                     <p>Immerſed in elements productive of theſe ſudden and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous effects, how is it poſſible that man ſhould paſs through life without feeling inconveniencies from principles capable of ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing viciſſitudes? Inſtead of wondering at the phenomenon of peſtilence and other epidemic diſeaſes, and hunting, with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcopic view, for a bundle of clothes in which to find the germ of a malady that deſolates the earth, men would ſhow more wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and more correct underſtanding, if they would collect facts, with care, examin them with candor, and endeavor by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to arrive at ſome knowlege of the powers and effects of thoſe elements which compoſe all animal bodies, and from whoſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>SINCE this work has been in the preſs, I have had the curioſity to trace back the revolutions of two or three comets, whoſe periods were calculated by Dr. Halley, to find how far his aſtronomical calculations are verified by the hiſtory of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of comets, in former ages. The following are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults.</p>
                     <p>The comet of 1682 Dr. Halley found to have a period of 75 years. If this calculation is exact, the ſame comet muſt have appeared in the following years. The firſt column contains the years when the comet muſt have appeared, ſuppoſing its period to be exactly 75 years—the ſecond, contains the years when a comet appeared, according to the preceding hiſtory.</p>

                     <p>I have no account of a comet in 887; but in page 112 of Vol. I. a ſevere plague and hard winter are mentioned, under that year. The events related in page 77, under the years 242 and 3, are ſuch as lead me to ſuſpect a comet, at that period, which correſponds with the calculations; but I have no account of any. The ſame remarks may be made reſpecting the events of the years 114 to 117, when Antioch was deſtroyed, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated page 70.</p>
                     <p>Of the events before Chriſt 16, I have no particular account. The three preceding periods of this comet, before Chriſt 145, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and 43—48—56 of Vol. I. And this might have been the ſtar alluded to by Juſtin, in the paſſage quoted in page 43.</p>
                     <p>But we have an inſuperable difficulty to theſe calculations—this ſtar, if its period is 129 years, ſhould have appeared in 1789 or 90; but no comet was ſeen. One appeared in the autumn of 1788, but I know not whether the elements of its trajectory correſponded with thoſe of the ſtar of 1661. Calculations of this kind are yet too uncertian to be the baſis of a ſyſtem.</p>
                     <p>It is greatly to be deſired that the revolutions of the comets could be reduced to as much certainty, as thoſe of the planets. Such calculations would enable as to account for many of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent changes on this globe; and aid us to fix the era of certain great phenomena of antiquity: For no fact is better eſtabliſhed, than that comets have a prodigious influence on the electricity of the earth and its atmoſphere.</p>
                     <p>The comet of 1680 is ſuppoſed to have a period of 575; and the appearance of a ſplendid ſtar of this kind in 1105 and 531, gives reaſon to believe the calculation juſt. If ſo, it muſt have appeared before Chriſt 44—619—1194—1769 and 2344. The latter year falls within 8 years of the period aſſigned to the del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uge. But the uncertainty of ancient chronology leaves room to queſtion all reſults from theſe calculations.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from <hi>common report,</hi> that I am led to queſtion every fact that does not come directly from the perſons concerned in the tranſaction related. I had ſuch confidence, for inſtance, in the facts publiſhed and believed by the people in New-Haven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the origin of the fever of 1794, in that city, from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported ſources, that I had prepared an account of it for the preſs, before I called on the perſons beſt able to give me correct information. On examination, I was ſurpriſed to find moſt of the ſuppoſed facts totally unfounded: and Mr. Gorham and Capt. Truman, the perſons concerned, when informed of the reports which had been circulated on the ſubject, expreſſed their ſurpriſe that people ſhould have propagated ſuch tales, without calling on them for a true ſtate of facts.</p>
                  <p>It was ſaid and publiſhed that Polly Gorham, the <hi>ſecond</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeized with the fever, was preſent in Mr. Auſtin's ſtore when the cheſt of clothes was opened. The gentleman who publiſhed this report, has ſince informed me that he had no authority for it, but the ſtory of a child of ſix or ſeven years old. But Capt. Truman who opened the cheſt himſelf informs me, that Polly Gorham was <hi>not</hi> in the ſtore at the time.</p>
                  <p>It was reported and is ſtill believed, by moſt of the people in the town, that Iſaac Gorham's wife waſhed infected clothes; but Mr. Gorham aſſures me that there is not the leaſt foundation for the ſtory, and he is aſtoniſhed that ſuch a tale could have been circulated. He cannot aſſign any good cauſe for the fever in his family, and is inclined to the opinion that no infection was received from the ſloop.</p>
                  <p>It is poſſible and probable that ſome perſons who came in the
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:036687_0696_100AA644968749C8"/>
ſloop had been into Gorham's houſe; at leaſt into the ſhop in the front room. And this is the only poſſible way to account for the propagation of infection from that ſloop, even admitting that it contained infected clothing. But even in this caſe, it would ſeem ſtrange that Gorham himſelf ſhould eſcape, and his wife and niece who were uſually in the back room, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract diſeaſe. But the following facts which have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Capt. Truman, ſince the firſt volume was printed, will ſhow the improbability, if not the impoſſibility, of ſuch a communication of infection.</p>
                  <p>This ſloop, called the Iris, arrived from Martinico at New-York in May. All her men and paſſengers were and had been, during the paſſage, in good health. The ſloop of courſe was permitted to enter as a clean veſſel, and ſhe was hauled up to a wharf, where ſhe lay ten or twelve days wind-bound, before ſhe could proceed to New-Haven. She had no cargo on board, except a few ſalted hides, which were taken out and put on board of a coaſter, commanded by Capt. Miles to be tranſported to New-Haven. This was done without the leaſt injury to any perſon concerned in removing the hides. At this time happened a long ſeries of eaſterly winds and rainy weather, ſucceeding the memorable froſt after the 17th of May 1794. In theſe rains the veſſel was waſhed inceſſantly day after day, and ſhe was viſited by many perſons who had buſineſs on board; and as it happens with all veſſels that lie at a wharf in ſuch a place, hundreds, if not thouſands muſt have been on board, while ſhe lay at New-York. Now it happens that not a ſoul among all that were on board, from the time of her leaving Martinico, till ſhe arrived at New-Haven, was affected with fever. How the ſloop or the hands, after having intercourſe with ſo many perſons, came to reſerve their infection for New-Haven, I ſubmit to be determined by wiſer heads than mine. The facts are here ſtated from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the perſons concerned—thoſe which have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore publiſhed, are mingled and confounded with popular rumors which can be traced to no genuin ſources.</p>
                  <p>Let it be noted that when the two firſt perſons were ſeized, no perſon ſuſpected the diſeaſe to be the yellow fever. Mrs.
<pb n="342" facs="unknown:036687_0697_100AA6472E37B210"/>
Gorham probably died without ever knowing her diſeaſe—at leaſt her phyſician did not ſuſpect it, till ſhe vomited black matter, the evening before her death. Hence it happened that no enquiry into the origin of the fever, took place till ſeveral days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and not till after the death of Mr. Auſtin and his clerk. This is one reaſon why it became difficult to obtain a true ſtate of facts—a difficulty that was greatly increaſed by the alarm and conſequent perturbation of the public mind.</p>
                  <p>And after all the queſtion of domeſtic or foreign origin is much better decided by the character and phenomena of the epidemic, than by any human teſtimony relating to things not viſible. The caſe of a bilious fever, attended with black vomit, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in page 306 of Vol. I. occurred in the laſt week in March, near the wharf and in the center of the ground, afterwards the ſeat of the fever. It was leſs malignant than in autumn, but from the deſcription of it given me by the woman's mother and the attending clergyman [the phyſician being dead] I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the diſeaſe to have been of the ſame ſpecies, and indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a diſpoſition in the atmoſphere of the place to give to fever that particular character.<note n="*" place="bottom">The phyſician, Dr. Hubbard, after the fever appeared in ſummer, mentioned to the Rev. Mr. Hubbard, that it was of the ſame ſpecies with that which occurred in March. This caſe was nine or ten weeks before the arrival of the Iris.</note> The ſcarlatina was then the current epidemic. In May this declined, and gradually diſappeared, in June and July, as the yellow fever advanced. To a philoſophic mind, theſe facts amount to evidence of domeſtic origin, that far out-weighs the uncertain and contradictory evidence of the importation of a ſubſtance which is neither viſible nor tangible.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the origin of the fever at Hartford, I have this further evidence. The ſloop mentioned in page 347, had never been in the leaſt infected with any diſeaſe whatever, before ſhe arrived at Hartford. Her former Captain died in May of a lingering com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He went to New-York after he was unwell and growing worſe, he returned and died at home. Captain Tucker then took the command, went to New-York and took on board a cargo of ſalt. From thence he ſailed to New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he lay five or ſix days, at the wharf, endeavoring to
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:036687_0698_100AA648B75B5B30"/>
fell the ſalt. While there, people indiſcriminately were on board, and among them ſeveral gentlemen of my acquaintance who give me this information. This was about the middle of July, and as it was juſt after the Neptune arrived from China, the wharf was unuſually crouded with people, who were paſſing and repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing between the wharf and that ſhip. Here then the ſloop did no miſchief. She went to Hartford and diſcharged her ſalt. I have unequivocal evidence that not a perſon concerned in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loading her, was affected with fever, and that ſeveral of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons firſt ſeized in Hartford, had not been near her. After ſhe left Hartford the captain and mate were ſeized, and the former died [not both as ſtated in page 347.]</p>
                  <p>Another veſſel, I find, has by ſome been ſuſpected of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the fever into Hartford. This alſo was a coaſting veſſel, which took in a paſſenger at New-York, who ſickened, after he came on board, and the maſter landed him at New-Haven. If I am rightly informed, this veſſel did not arrive at Hartford, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til after the firſt caſes of fever occurred; but of this I am not certain. Certain it is, that no perſon on board, except the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger landed at New-Haven, was ever ill, and therefore the caſe deſerves no conſideration.</p>
                  <p>It ought further to be ſtated that two or three weeks before the alarm at Hartford, and before the arrival of thoſe veſſels, a caſe of fever occured of the malignant kind, and in all eſſential points, with the character of the yellow fever. I have lately learnt that a ſimilar fact occurred in Boſton in 1798. Theſe caſes are not uſually numbered with thoſe of yellow fever—but the truth is, and ſuch will it appear to be, when ſcience, philoſophy and candor ſhall triumph over prejudice and popular tales, that theſe milder caſes of fever, bearing the character in a degree, of the ſubſequent epidemic, are the precurſors of the diſeaſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low—they are the effect of the atmoſpheric principle on partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular ſuſceptible conſtitutions, before the proper ſeaſon for the full force of the principle to operate—they are irreſiſtible evidence that the diſeaſes which they precede, are uſually, if not always, generated in the place where they exiſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="344" facs="unknown:036687_0699_100AA64CE55F8528"/>SINCE the firſt volume was printed, I have obtained from attending phyſicians, an account of the fever at Middle-Haddam, in the town of Chatham, on Connecticut river in 1796. [This is mentioned in page 331 to have been in 1797, but it was in 1796.]</p>
                  <p>This fever was traced in every inſtance to a veſſel from a port in Hiſpaniola, which was highly infected. No perſon was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, without direct intercourſe with the veſſel, the clothing or the ſick. About 30 perſons were affected, eight of whom died. When carried to a diſtance, the fever did not ſpread.</p>
                  <p>That this was a diſeaſe contracted from imported infection is evident from this circumſtance—that in every caſe it could be traced to intercourſe with the ſick or infected articles—it was not taken by paſſing along the ſtreet nor from houſe to houſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother fact is equally demonſtrative of this origin; which is, that it commenced late in September and had no precurſors. When it ariſes from the atmoſphere of the place, it always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins as early as Auguſt or earlier—and this is probably true of every autumnal complaint in our latitude.</p>
                  <p>The fever in that place therefore was what I call a <hi>diſeaſe of mere infection,</hi> in contradiſtinction from yellow fever originating in the country, which begins uniformly in the hot months, is taken without intercourſe with the ſick or with infected articles, has its precurſors and abſorbs all other diſeaſes or gives them all its predominant type. The diſtinction is ſo obvious that it is not eaſy to miſtake it.</p>
                  <p>Of the diſeaſes from imported ſource this is one—two or three other inſtances in the United States have been mentioned. But moſt of the inſtances of this fever in America, ſince 1790, have had the unequivocal characters of epidemics—ſuch charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as never attend, and as cannot poſſibly attend, diſeaſes of mere infection.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſummer paſt, the wild pigeons in the weſtern parts of New-York ſtate and in Pennſylvania, have been affected with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of which many have died. It is underſtood that the head or neck was ſwelled; but I have no correct account of the diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="345" facs="unknown:036687_0700_100AA64B39D18F38"/>FROM the report of a maſter of a veſſel, it appears that fiſh of various kinds periſhed in September or October laſt, on the Carolina coaſt from Cape Look-out to Cape Fear, a diſtance of 70 miles. Some were ſeen dead and others dying, as far as the eye could reach. The yellow fever has alſo prevailed in ſome parts of both Carolinas. Does not the death of fiſh afford reaſon to believe that the electrical fluid or mephitic air, is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally diſcharged from the earth in unuſual abundance? And may not local diſeaſes be aſcribed to that cauſe?</p>
                  <p>IN addition to what I have ſaid in the 16th ſection, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to prediſpoſition to a particular diſeaſe, I would obſerve, that we ought to make a diſtinction between a <hi>natural aptitude to a diſeaſe,</hi> and an <hi>adventitious liability</hi> to it, from artificial cauſes. The latter is what uſually paſſes under the name of <hi>prediſpoſition:</hi> And this may lead to error. When perſons ſay, a man will not take a fever by infection unleſs he is prediſpoſed, they uſually mean that he has, by accidental cauſes, <hi>prepared</hi> his body to be affected. Hence we continually hear the doctrin that infection will not operate in a healthy atmoſphere; but in order to give it force and effect, the atmoſphere muſt be <hi>prepared;</hi> that is, muſt ſuffer a change favorable to a diſeaſe, but not ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it.</p>
                  <p>I apprehend this doctrin is erroneous. The fact, as a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral one, is the reverſe; and the longer a body remains in health in an infected atmoſphere, the leſs liable is it to the diſeaſe. So true is this, that priſoners in jails ſuffer no injury from the air, which will deſtroy the lives of men who enter it, from freſh air. This fact is well known. It is equally true, in our cities, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring peſtilence, that perſons from freſh air, are much more liable to be ſeized, on entering the infected atmoſphere, than thoſe who have lived in it. Hence in every caſe of mere infection, perſons are <hi>moſt expoſed</hi> to it, who are <hi>leaſt prepared</hi> or <hi>prediſpoſed</hi> by breathing an infected air.</p>
                  <p>But not ſuch is the fact with regard to the influence of atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheric
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:036687_0701_100AA651399B48B0"/>
cauſes on particular bodies. In this caſe, the cauſe ſingles out and ſeizes the perſons, who have a particular aptitude or habit of body, in a manner altogether unaccountable. Sometimes this power is evidently in operation a long time, before it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps this natural aptitude of a body to receive or reſiſt diſeaſe, may be illuſtrated by the following fact, which is under every man's obſervation. Let two apples or pears, be taken from a tree at the ſame time—let them be apparently alike in ſoundneſs and in every particular on which their preſervation may be ſuppoſed to depend. Lay them by the ſide of each other—equally expoſed to heat and moiſture. In this caſe, one may and often will periſh many weeks before the other. This aptitude to periſh is natural, and doubtleſs conſiſts in the interior organization of the fruit; but this is utterly inviſible, even with the beſt microſcope.</p>
                  <p>This idea ſeems to be important towards accounting for the operation of a peſtilential atmoſphere on various bodies, and is confirmed by the facts related of peſtilence that has ſeized par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular families or tribes of men, while others, equally expoſed, have eſcaped. This may be called natural prediſpoſition or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to a diſeaſe, in diſtinction from that ſtate of the body which is the effect of artificial or accidental cauſes, and which may be the commencement of the diſeaſe, according to Brown's definition.</p>
                  <p>SINCE the firſt volume was put to preſs, I have collected from various authors, accounts of ſeveral plagues in Egypt, which I had not then found. As I have ſuggeſted that peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is uſually marked by catarrh, it may be proper to lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether further evidence of the fact. Egypt and Conſtantinople are the places where autumnal fevers are moſt apt to take the form of peſtilence. Catarrh, in thoſe cities, ſeems cloſely to attend the plague.

                  <p>There are ſome long periods in which I have no account of the diſeaſes. The plague of 1705 in Egypt is the only one of which I have an account, that I cannot trace to a connection with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal catarrh; and I have no account of a plague in Egypt after the influenza of 1709. I aſcribe this however to the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my accounts. How greatly to be regretted is the want of accurate and complete regiſters of epidemic diſeaſes!</p>
                  <p>Let this detail of authentic facts, be compared with what eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man may recollect in America. How the preſent ſeries of plagues was introduced by a double portion of catarrh! for the influenza of 1789 was followed in 1790 by another influenza— the only inſtance I can find on record of two of theſe epidemics within the ſhort ſpace of ſix or eight months! Let it be recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo that catarrh was prevalent in the ſpring of 1791, 1793 and 1798, and that in our large cities, peſtilence has in every inſtance, been introduced or followed [or both] by influenza, which has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been local, that is, very much limited to the place where the peſtilence had prevailed or was to prevail. Who then can deny that catarrh and plague are connected in cauſe? It is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to deny it—the evidence is concluſive—and when this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhall be fully inveſtigated, it will appear that peſtilence, whether plague or yellow fever, is produced by the ſame general change in the properties of the air, which produces influenza—the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from the one epidemic to the other being cauſed by the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or other unknown cauſe.</p>

                  <p>I have recently learnt from Irwin's Travels, that there was no plague in Egypt from 1770 to 1777, and from other writers I collect that it was not there for two or three years after. This is a remarkable fact, as Egypt is ſeldom exempt longer than five years in one period. Now it will be remarked that in the ſame period, and for ſome time before and after, no epidemic infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious yellow fever occurred in America, nor as far as I can learn, in the Weſt-India Iſlands. Yet this was a time of war between Great-Britain, America and France.<note n="*" place="bottom">No comet was ſeen between 1770 and 1784—a period of more than thirteen years—ſuch an interval had not happened within 150 years, and probably not in three centuries.</note> But it is a curious fact, that in thoſe parts of the earth moſt ſubject to peſtilence, the plague and yellow fever ſhould have diſappeared at the ſame time; and in countries 5000 miles diſtant, certain kinds of diſeaſes ſhould have loſt that peculiar character which diſtinguiſhes the plague.</p>
                  <p>But the hiſtory of epidemics furniſhes numerous inſtances of ſimilar revolutions in the prevailing type or character of diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>In Mr. Tytler's Treatiſe on the plague and yellow fever, which I have juſt read, I find a paſſage, in page 379, which aſſerts that certain quotations in my letters to Dr. Currie in 1797 were made "with a view to diſpute the contagious nature of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever." This is not accurate. My view was to prove a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial difference in the yellow fever at different times, and to ſhow certain inconſiſtencies in the reaſoning of my antagoniſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="350" facs="unknown:036687_0705_100AA65B66E76190"/>It is proper now to mention that I wrote thoſe letters, with a view if poſſible, to ſettle the queſtion of the origin of the yellow fever, by a fair ſtatement of facts and fair concluſions from the facts. I had not then attended to the hiſtory of epidemics; and it will be ſeen by one of my letters, that I had embraced the popular opinion then current, that the influenza in 1789 and 1790 was a new diſeaſe. Since I have ſtudied this ſubject, I am ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed not only at my own ignorance, but at the ignorance of all claſſes of men, in whatever regards the hiſtory of epidemic diſeaſes, and the phyſical phenomena of the earth and atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere. On this ſubject and whatever regards the origin of the plague and yellow fever, Mr. Tytler's Treatiſe has diſappointed my hopes and expections. His hiſtory of peſtilence is from firſt to laſt imperfect and inaccurate. And how it is poſſible for a man to ſuppoſe that the plague was originally ſent upon the Jews as a puniſhment, and by them has been conveyed to other nations, p. 47. or that the plague in Rome in the year 80 was occaſioned by infection conveyed from Jeruſalem, by the army of Titus in the year 70. p. 13. 45. 50. Or that it is of divine original, p. 369, any more than all other diſtempers—Or that it has been uſually propagated by war and commerce p. 369, when it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from ſcripture that it was a diſeaſe in Egypt, before the days of Moſes—and has in every age infeſted nations who had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the Jews—when alſo it is expreſsly declared by Livy and Oroſious to have been uſually in Rome in time of peace—I ſay, how it is poſſible, in this period of the world, for ſuch opinions to exiſt, I cannot conceive.</p>
                  <p>On the ſubject of contagion alſo, or rather infection, Mr. Tytler, has adopted the common theory—a theory acknowleged to be inadequate to the ſolution of the phenomena of peſtilence, as plague and yellow fever always ceaſe, at the proper ſeaſon, when the infection is moſt general.</p>
                  <p>The reſults of my inveſtigations will explain moſt, if not all, the difficulties attending this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>The origin of peſtilence is traced to eſſential changes in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, which recur at certain unequal periods. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of theſe changes are certain epidemic diſeaſes, as meaſles,
<pb n="351" facs="unknown:036687_0706_100AA65D0F0DCE38"/>
affections of the throat, and eſpecially influenza, which pervades the globe or large portions of it within a few months or at moſt, in two years. Near the time of theſe phenomena, and uſually ſubſequent to the influenza, the plague occurs in Egypt and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, and if the change in the atmoſphere is very great, the plague occurs in all parts of the Levant and in other parts of Africa, Europe and Aſia. At the ſame time, in the more cool and healthy regions of the north, epidemics of a milder type than the plague, but malignant and infectious, prevail, and in ſhort, ordinary diſeaſes aſſume new and more fatal ſymptoms. In America, the ſame or ſimilar changes are obſerved. The fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Weſt-Indies, which is uſually not infectious, becomes more malignant and aſſumes in a degree the character of the plague. In our large cities, the autumnal remitting fever is changed into the ſame malignant form, and the country ſuffers by meaſles, ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latina, dyſentery, typhus and remitting fevers. Theſe changes uſually take place in both hemiſpheres at the ſame time; but ſometimes the peſtilential principle ſeems to be more ſevere on one continent or in one country, than in another</p>
                  <p>Theſe changes are uſually diſtinguiſhed by viſible and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able phenomena in the natural world.</p>
                  <p>The periods of peſtilence are unequal and indefinite—ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of only five or ſix years duration; at other times, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ten or fifteen years. But in the latter caſe, the epidemics mentioned uſually run through a country twice—that is, two peſtilential periods occur, without an interval of time.</p>
                  <p>During theſe periods, contagion and infection aid the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain diſeaſes, particularly the meaſles, ſmall-pox, whooping cough and angina maligna. In the dyſentery, yellow fever and plague, infection has its effect and obviouſly ſpreads the diſeaſes. But all thoſe diſeaſes originate without infection, in all countries where the heat, moiſture or other local cauſe will permit the diſeaſe to exiſt. In ſome caſes, they are introduced and ſpread ſolely by infection, but they are then always within human control, and it is the fault of man, if the ſphere of their operation is not very limited. In moſt caſes, theſe diſeaſes have the unequivocal characters of local epidemics, and no human power can reſtrain them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="352" facs="unknown:036687_0707_100AA65FCD38E340"/>On the ſubject of cure, if I may be permitted to have an opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, I ſhould concur with Mr. Tytler in the preference of the diaphoretic method. Circumſtances may indeed defeat this meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, and compel the phyſician to adopt others. But from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of nature, and the immenſe capacity of vapor to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorb heat, I take perſpiration to be the natural remedy for fever.</p>
                  <p>On the ſubject of the proximate cauſe of the plague, the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of Mr. Tytler are highly reſpectable. I fully agree with him in the influence of the electrical fluid. I believe this active and elaſtic principle to be the great agent in all the changes viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inviſible, in our atmoſphere, and I cannot but think my inveſtigations have unlocked very important ſecrets on that point. I believe alſo that this fluid is the immediate agent in ſupporting life, and the intellectual powers. Received into the lungs, it ſupplies the body with heat, and by its elaſtic power, dilates thoſe organs of life to receive new ſupplies. The machinery of the body is thus calculated, while it laſts, to preſerve perpetual motion. At the ſame time, this fluid, by the ſame elaſtic power, becomes the medium of ſenſation, throughout the nervous ſyſtem, and by its inſtantaneous motions, communicates ſenſation and thought, with the celerity of lightning.</p>
