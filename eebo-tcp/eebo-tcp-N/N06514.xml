            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>—Fear GOD: Honour the King.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE Principal and moſt Noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our being made Rational Creatures, is to Capacitate us for Religion; and thereby to Qualify us for Uſefulneſs in the World, and for the Enjoyment of our Maker: An End, truly worthy of it's Author, and our Exiſtence. So that ſome have tho't, that a Religious Creature, or a Creature capable of Religion; a better Definition of Man, than merely a Rational Creature or a Creature Endowed with Reaſonable Underſtanding: Becauſe what ever Reſemblance of Reaſon may appear in ſome parts of the Senſitive Creation; yet none of Religion. And by how much the more we exert ourſelves in the Practice of Religion and Moral Virtue; By ſo much the better do we Conform to the Injunction in our Text. <hi>Fear God, Honour</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:008267_0005_102E781971D464B8"/>
               <hi>the King.</hi> Loyalty being Dictated as an Eſſential part of Duty, both by the Light of Nature &amp; Revelation. And nothing is more Evident, than it's being ſtrictly Enjoined in our Chriſtian Profeſſion. I need not go from my Text &amp; Context to Confirm this. The Apoſtle in the 9th verſe of the Context Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds thoſe to whom He wrote, of their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Priviledge &amp; Dignity as Chriſtians and Saints; and the Obligations they were under to Conduct, accordingly: <hi>But ye are a Choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an Holy Nation, a peculiar People; that ye ſhould ſhew forth the Praiſes of him who hath called you out of Darkneſs into marvellous light.</hi> In the 11th &amp; 12th verſes, He beſecheth them to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treemly careful of their Moral conduct and Converſation: that they give no Occaſion to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to reproach them with Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; Diſloyalty: <hi>But to Submit to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's ſake: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be to the King as Supream; or unto Governors, as unto them that are Sent by him for the puniſhment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well. i. e.</hi> To be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Civil Government, out of Conſcience, and Obedience to God, who has Ordained the Civil Magiſtracy, and Commands Obedience unto it. There are two things implyed in this, (1.) That Diſobedience to Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity proceeds from Mens Luſts, (2) That ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008267_0006_102E781D9C6B2198"/>
Diſobedience, would open the Mouth of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers againſt the Goſpel: and that a Loyal behaviour will put to Silence the ignorance of Fooliſh Men; as in verſe 15. In the next words the Apoſtle ſeems to prevent a ſecret Objection. Some might Reply, we are free in Chriſt, and therefore owe no Obedience to any above us. The Apoſtle grants the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticedent, underſtanding it of their freedom from the burden &amp; curſe of the Law, &amp; the bondage of Sin &amp; Satan; but withal he Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s them not to withdraw their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Magiſtrate, under this pretence: <hi>As free and Not uſing your Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as the Servants of God.</hi> But ſays He, in the next words, <hi>Honour all Men,</hi> according to their State and Calling: <hi>Love the brotherhood,</hi> as becomes Saints; and to include all in a word, <hi>Fear God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Honour the King.</hi> i. e. Let your Religious &amp; Civil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment be ſuch as becomes your Profeſſion as Chriſtians: Examples of Virtue &amp; Piety, and a Bar to every Objection.</p>
            <p>I ſhall improve the words more fully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this DOCTRINAL Obſervation, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Religion and Loyalty is the Duty and Glory of a People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things are implyed in the words; in as much as the <hi>Fear of God</hi> includes the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008267_0007_102E7833C098B9A8"/>
whole of Religion, and <hi>Honouring the King</hi> all Loyalty and Subjection that is due to Civil Authority.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay the Fear of God, is often put to Expreſs the ſum of our Religion, and the whole of Duty, as in Job 28. 28. <hi>And unto man he ſaid, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> Pſal. 111. 10. <hi>The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wiſdom: a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding have all they that do his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And Eccl. 12. 13. <hi>Let us hear the concluſion of the whole matter, Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.</hi> Now the Reaſon why this is put for the whole of Religion, ſeems to be, becauſe Fear is ſo powerful a Principle, and has ſo great an influence upon men to make them Religious. For (<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Tillotſon.</note> as one obſerves) it is a Paſſion that is moſt deeply rooted in our natures, &amp; flowes immediately from that Principle of ſelf-preſervation which God has planted in every Man. Every one deſires his own Preſervation &amp; Happineſs, &amp; therefore hath a natural Dread &amp; Horror of every thing that can deſtroy his Being, or Endanger his Felicity: and the greateſt Danger is from the greateſt Power, &amp; that is Omnipotency. So that the Fear of God is an inward acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legement of a holy and juſt Being, which is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008267_0008_102E783745F76F70"/>
Armed with an Almighty &amp; Irreſiſtable Power. God having hid in every Man's Conſcience, a ſecret awe and dread of his Infinite Power, and Eternal Juſtice. Now Fear being ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate to our Natures, it is the ſtrongeſt Bond of Laws, and the greateſt Security of our Duty. For however much we have loſt the reliſh of true Happineſs, yet not the ſenſe of Pain &amp; Miſery; So that what Love does not attract, Fear may excite.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That other Expreſſion of <hi>Honouring the King;</hi> includes all Loyalty &amp; due Obedience to the Civil Magiſtrate: for as the King is the Head and Fountain of Civil Power, ſo Subordinate Authority, are ſtreams iſſuing there from. This by a <hi>Metanimia</hi> a Figure often uſed in Scripture, is ſufficiently expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>My Method ſhall be,
<list>
                  <item>I. <hi>To ſhew that Religion is the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of all Orders of Men, and the chiefeſt Glory of any People.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>That a Spirit of Loyalty is Eſſential to the Peace &amp; Happineſs of a People.</hi> And</item>
                  <item>III. <hi>To Improve the Subject, and Apply the whole to the preſent Occaſion.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. <hi>Religion is the greateſt Concern of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Men, and the chiefeſt Glory of a People.</hi> This is of univerſal extent; it reaches, (or
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008267_0009_102E7838CAC602C8"/>
ſhould do) from the King on the Throne, to the Maid behind the Mill. There is none above it, nor any beneath it. Policy, Power, or Opulency, is the aſſignment of but few, but Religion is incumbent upon all: and it is as Beneficial in its Nature, as it is Extenſive in its Regards. It includes the Knowledge of the greateſt Things.—The Poſſeſſion of the beſt Good;—and the Enjoyment of the moſt laſting Tranquillity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Religion includes the Knowledge of the Greateſt things. To Know God and Chriſt, Ourſelves, and the way to be for ever happy, is certainly the moſt extenſive &amp; uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Our Irreligious and unhappy Eſtate by Nature, is juſtly called a ſtate of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance &amp; Darkneſs;<note n="‖" place="bottom">Eph. 4. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Having the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance which is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their hearts.</hi> Now the very Nature &amp; Deſign of Religion, is <hi>To open</hi> our <hi>eyes, and to turn</hi> us <hi>from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that</hi> we <hi>may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance among them which are ſanctified by faith in</hi> Chriſt.<note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 26. 18.</note> The Knowledge of God in his Nature and Perfections, is truly Excellent and Deſirable: It gives the greateſt Delight and Satisfaction to the Soul, to Diſcover and Contemplate thoſe his Perfections: For

whatever is Beautiful and Amiable, as it is diſperſed &amp; ſcattered in the Creature, is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat &amp; Centers in God: and not only ſo, but it Exceeds our Comprehenſion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: and there is an agreeable ſatisfaction in gazing upon, and adoring Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility; and being ſwallowed up in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of the Divine Perfections.</p>
            <p>Again, To Know God in his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, in the Manifeſtations which he has made of himſelf in the K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

it's Dignity. The Light of the Goſpel (ſays<note n="‖" place="bottom">Dr. Bates.</note> one) hath clearly Revealed ſo much as is Requiſite to be Known in our earthly State; yet the Sublimer parts are ſtill Secret, and reſerved for a full diſcovery by the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Saviour's Appearance.—It is the moſt excellent Knowledge, as that alone which can ſatisfy the immortal Appetite; and the moſt Important; for 'tis no leſs than our Recovery from Extream &amp; Eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and the Reſtoring of us to the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Bleſſed God: a Felicity without Compariſon or End: And in proportion to the Regard we have to Salvation, will be our Delight to Know the Means by which we may obtain it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in the next place; To Know Jeſus Chriſt, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, &amp; conſequently of our Salvation, muſt needs be the moſt Neceſſary and Excellent Knowledge. For it is of abſolute Neceſſity that we Know God in Chriſt in order to our being happy: <hi>For this is Life Eternal to Know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> We muſt Know him to be more than meerly the Meſſenger of God, to Publiſh the glad Tidings of Salvation, and to Direct in the way of Life: we muſt Know him to be the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God and the <hi>Power</hi> of God; by the Effectual Application of his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008267_0012_102E78F5E5688DA8"/>
Grace to us by his Holy Spirit. But to know him after this manner, we muſt at the ſame time know our own Miſery &amp; Unworthineſs, together with the need we have of a Mediator. <hi>Cognoſce te ipſum,</hi> Know thy Self; was eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Divine Sentence, by the Learned Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and is known to be of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance by the experienced Chriſtian. We ought by no means to ſeparate thoſe two parts of Knowledge; becauſe each alone, is not only unprofitable but dangerous. For as <hi>Monſieur Paſchal</hi> obſerves, The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God without the Knowledge of our own Miſery, is the Nurſe of Pride: The Knowledge of our own Miſery, without the Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt is the Mother of Deſpair. But the true Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt exempts us alike from Pride and from Deſpair; by giving us at once a Sight, not only of God, &amp; of our own Miſery, but alſo of the Mercy of God in the Relief of our Miſery, We may Know God without Knowing our own Miſery; or we may Know our own Miſery without Knowing God; or we may Know them both without Knowing the Means of Obtaining from God the Relief of our Miſery: But we cannot Know Jeſus Chriſt, without the Knowledge of our Miſeries and their Cure. In as much as Jeſus Chriſt is not only God, but he is God under this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, the Healer &amp; Repairer of our Miſeries.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008267_0013_102E78F9503765D0"/>
Thus all they that ſeek God without Jeſus Chriſt can never meet with ſuch Light in their enquiries, as may afford them true Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſolid Comfort; becauſe God is Known and communed with, but in &amp; by a Mediator.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Religion puts the Subject into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the beſt Good. Here I would be underſtood, what I mean by Religion, when I ſay, it includes the Knowledge of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Things, and the Poſſeſſion of the beſt Good, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> a Divine Principle implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Soul which Diſpoſes and Qualifies it for the Service and Enjoyment of God. The unhappy miſtake which mankind ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally labour under with reſpect to the Nature of Religion, is the ſad Occaſion of its being ſo much Neglected or Perverted. The conception of its being an Exteriour Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, is the Occaſion of its being made an Engine of State, or a Noſe of Wax that may ſerve every purpoſe. But as Mr. <hi>Shaw</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, It is not ſo much given of God, as itſelf is ſomething of God in the Soul: as the Soul is not ſo properly ſaid to give, as to be the Life of Man. As the Conjunction of the Soul with the Body, ſo verily the Life of the Soul ſtands in its Conjunction with God, by a ſpiritual Union of Will and Affections. The nearneſs to God, which a Soul Enjoys by Religion is called a Cohabitation. Thus it is

            <p n="3">3. It is the Enjoyment of the moſt laſting Tranquility. There is not all that Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Comfort in a Dignified State, that we are ready to apprehend at a Diſtance: Good and Grand, are different Things. The Great and the Opulent are ordinarily Envied, as the moſt Comfortable and Happy part of Mankind: But thoſe who poſſeſs this Station, find they have their Difficulties, which at Times are ſo Preſſing, that they deſerve Pity rather than Envy. But the Soul that poſſeſſes that Divine Principle of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is ſure of Comfort, let its external Circumſtances be as they will. This Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es how to be Abaſed and how to Abound, and in every State to be Content. It

enlightens the Underſtanding, informs the Judgment, influences the Will, regulates the Paſſions and Affections, and gives the Man the entire Poſſeſſion of himſelf, in the midſt of Hurry and Tumult. It is like that benign Stream, of which the Pſalmeſt ſpeaks in Pſalm 46. <hi>We will not Fear, though the Earth be Removed, &amp; though the Mountains be carried into the midſt of the Sea; though the Waters thereof Roar, and be Troubled; though the Mountains Shake with the Swelling thereof: There is a River the</hi> Streams <hi>whereof ſhall make glad the City of our God.</hi> To be at Peace with God, and our own Conſciences, is the moſt ſtable Peace, and affords the moſt laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranquility: and with all its preſent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, it is but a prelude and foretaſte of what we may Expect to poſſeſs and enjoy, in a future and eternal State. There is nothing we have now Obſerved of Religion in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Influence, but what is accomodate to all Men; and peculiarly Incumbent upon thoſe in Authority and Power; as we ſhall have Occaſion to conſider more particularly hereafter.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>That a Spirit of Loyalty, is Eſſential to the preſent Comfort and Happineſs of a People: and really comes within our Religious Profeſſion and Engagement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A juſt diſcharge of the Duties of the ſecond Table, are as Incumbent as thoſe of the firſt.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008267_0016_102E79022565BB00"/>
For as we are to Love the Lord our God with all our Heart and Strength, and Might, ſo we are to Love our Neighbour as our Selves: and in the diſcharge of Relative Duty (under which comes that of Loyalty) conſiſts, no ſmall part of our Religion, and the Comfort and Happineſs of the preſent Life. A due Obedience to all proper Authority, is not only the Beauty, but Strength &amp; Glory of a People. But Mutiny &amp; Rebellion, are as diſtructive to the Political Body, as Sword and Peſtilence to the Natural. There is a certain Mechanic Order, which is Requiſite to adjuſt the movements of every kind of Body; which if diſconcerted, will deſtroy the modle of the whole; and incapacitate the ſame for proper action. Where Pride &amp; Vanity is ſo preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as to render Men uneaſy in their proper Station, and troubleſome to their Superiors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it fills the State with Diſorder &amp; Confuſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It marrs its Beauty, &amp; ſaps its Strength: The moſt effective method for preventing or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting of which is, to comply with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Apoſtle, viz. For every Man to abide ſteadfaſt in the calling where with God hath called him; and be content with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignments of Providence. God's <hi>Iſrael</hi> of Old, was never ſo Renowned &amp; Happy, as when under proper reſtrictions with reſpect to their Order &amp; Government.

were Subject &amp; Loyal, things went well in <hi>Judah.</hi> They were then the envy of their Neighbours, and a terror to their Enemies: But as ſoon as ever, there comes an Arbitrary Prince on the Throne, and a mutinous &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Spirit prevails among the People, they immediately become a Pray to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a Reproach to their Neighbours, &amp; Peſt to themſelves. This is evident by comparing the ſtate of this People, under the Reign and Government of <hi>David, Solomon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who were Wiſe, Judicious &amp; Prudent Men; and the People were quiet &amp; eaſy under their Adminiſtration: and that of <hi>Saul, Rehoboam, Ahab, Jehu,</hi> &amp; <hi>Jehoiakim.</hi> As theſe Kings were Deſpotick &amp; Arbitrary in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo the People were continually uneaſy and mutinous; and the State kept in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Fermentation. And as the Apoſtle Obſerves, (in another Caſe) theſe Things were Written for our Example and Warning. Difficulties in a State, are not ſo much owing the particular mode of Government, as to the conduct of Rulers, and the diſpoſition of the People. <hi>e. g.</hi> The Empire of <hi>Perſia,</hi> has been kept in regular ſtate, that is, Free from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections and Rebellion, and have acquired great Repute, as well as Conqueſts under the Government of <hi>Naidar Shab,</hi> their late Prince; who was a very Arbitrary &amp; Sovereign Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; but a Man of great Sagacity &amp; Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.

While ſome other People under the mildeſt Government, and beſt Conſtitution, have been diſtreſſed by inteſtine Jarrs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Practices: So that Loyalty, more than mere Policy, Happifies a People.

Alas for the many crying Evils wherewith our Nation and Land Abounds! too many now to be Numbred; I ſhall only in general mention, our Infidelity, Formality and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of God's holy Name and Day; our Abuſe of a Saviour, and the Operations of his holy Spirit, together with a Contempt of the Goſpel and its Ordinances; our Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and Diſobedience to juſt Authority; our Pride, Enmity, Luxury and Profuſeneſs; our Impurity and Intemperance; our Avarice, Oppreſſion &amp; Injuſtice; Falſe-ſwearing, Lying, Slandering, Reviling, Envying and Defaming

But the Neceſſity of a Reformation is peculiarly Obvious at this day. The Moſt High is manifeſtly Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting with us: And the Conſequence we may expect will be in the Reformation or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of this People.

He has Righteouſly drawn forth the Sword of the Wilderneſs againſt us, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the Breach of his Holy Covenant; in letting looſe a Numerous, Savage and Blood-Thirſty People, to make Spoil of us, and lay waſte his Heritage. Like the <hi>Medes</hi> of old, <hi>They regard not Silver, and as for Gold, they do not deſire it; Their Bows do daſh the young Men to pieces, and they have no pity on the fruit of the Womb, and their Eyes ſpare not the Children.</hi>

What but a Principle of Religion, a ſtedfaſt Truſt in God could ſupport us?

Were we inured to Slavery, and uſed to Bonds; were it barely changing Maſters, and going but from one State of Servitude to another, it were not ſo much: But it is changing Liberty for Slavery, and the moſt free and generous State, for the moſt vile and abject.

And that eſpecially as it has the moſt direct &amp; powerful tendency to Aſſimilate them to the likeneſs of the Divine Original of all Power: and Qualifies them for the moſt happy way of Governing. It fills Men with Noble, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, &amp; Heroick Principles; and diſpoſes them to anſwer the ends of their Exaltation. It cures them of what is Little, Mean and Selfiſh; and puts them upon ſeeking the Good of others more than themſelves. It will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly correct their inordinate Affection of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Power, and unreaſonable Greatneſs; by teaching them the Honour &amp; Advantage, of Self-Conqueſt. The ſame holy Principle, will poliſh their rough Natures, and ſweeten their Tempers, and make them Amiable, as well as Honourable in the ſight of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: Whereas Irreligion and Impiety, does ſtrangely leſſen Greatneſs, and ſecretly &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably derive ſome Weakneſs, even upon Authority itſelf. But Religion will greatly ſtrengthen their Authority, as it naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures

a Veneration, &amp; commands Reverence. This will put them under a double Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; that whiles they adorn their Poſts, they beſt ſerve the People; and are themſelves Examples of what they enjoin others by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. It will ſet them above the flatteries of fawning Sychophants, or the unreaſonable murmurs of a giddy Populace. In a word, it will be the beſt Support under the preſent Weight of Government, and the only Title to a future and glorious Reward. Now then, this being the happy Effect of Religion in Rulers, what may we not Expect from our Honourable Legiſlature. And ſince his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, has aſſigned it as my Province to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate on this publick and ſolemn Occaſion, (Conſcious indeed I am of my own Inequality and Inſufficiency for the Buſineſs) but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, I truſt I have Liberty to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs myſelf to your Honours, the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Government, now convened in this Place.</p>
            <p>Honoured and much Eſteemed;</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible you are called in Providence to take the Conduct of this People, in as Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and Critical a Seaſon, perhaps, as our Land has ever yet Known: And will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſee the Neceſſity of what I have been Urging, and will not be wanting in your Places to Enforce the ſame, as the moſt effective Method for the lengthening out of our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity

—It has pleaſed the Moſt High to raiſe you up for ſuch a Day as this; a Day wherein all the Liberties and Priviledges of this People, both Civil and Sacred are ſtruck at; and all that is worth Enjoying is at Stake; even Life itſelf not excepted. And whiles we are Invaded by ſo Numerous, Potent and Crafty an Enemy, who have already obtained to many Advantages againſt us, and are ſtill exerting their whole <hi>Poſſe</hi> to ſubject us: And withal ſo many inteſtine Jarrs, ſhrewd Suſpicions and Jealouſies, unreaſonable Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and Repinings, it ſurely requires a ſteady Hand and a gallant Heart at Helm. Wherefore gird up the Loins of your Minds &amp; be Strong: only be thou ſtrong and very couragious, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do all that the Law of the Lord Requireth thee, turn not from it, to the right Hand or to the left, that thou mayeſt Proſper, whither ſoever thou goeſt. And by how much the more Preſſing and Difficult our Circumſtances are, by ſo much the more Active and Vigorous, may your Zeal and Attention be. Your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours are very Senſible the preſent Seaſon is on ſome Accounts, the moſt Critical and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, which this Country ever ſaw. We are purſued by an Active, Perfidious, Savage Enemy, with ſuch Vigour and Rage, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all their paſt Diligence, Courage and Reſolution. They give us ſufficient Reaſon,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008267_0028_102E79B48FA34008"/>
to be Convinced, they are Reſolved to execute a Plan which was long ſince laid by the ableſt States-Man they ever had; and which if God ſhall pleaſe to allow them to Execute; this Country is like to be a Theatre of War and Miſery, in ſucceeding Times; or the fair Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony which has been left us, become a Prey of the worſt of Men. We have now for Years paſt, with ſmall and weak Efforts, and the Groans of great Burdens and Expence, been labouring in doing nothing, but expoſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Scorn and Reproach of the World.</p>
            <p>I think it my Duty now to Congratulate your Honours, and my Country; that God has put it into the Heart of the King, and his Miniſters to Appoint, and to Call and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us to ſuch Meaſures, as preſent us with the faireſt Hopes (humanly ſpeaking) that we ever had, of curbing and bringing to Reaſon, the moſt Inveterate, Ambitious and Reſtleſs Enemy in the World; and obliging them to let us live in Peace. Theſe Meaſures, for Subſtance, are ſuch as all Wiſe, Diſcerning Lovers of their Country, have been wiſhing for.—We Congratulate ourſelves, that God has diſpoſed the Hearts of our Rulers ſo Readily &amp; Amply to Provide for the exerting the Strength of this Colony, ſo that nothing may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our Part, to the carrying the King's wiſe and kind Purpoſes for us into Execution.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008267_0029_102E79BB03FCDBD8"/>
—I believe it is the ſincere Wiſh of every Honeſt Lover of his Country, and of a King who greatly Deſerves the Love and Revere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all his Subjects, that nothing may Hinder, Diſcourage or Retard your Reſolutions in this Intereſting Affair; and that you may be Succeſsful in your Endeavours to Excite and Prevail with the other Colonies to do their juſt Proportion, to rid theſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the Hands of ſtrange Children; and that the backwardneſs of Others, may not be the Means of our being again made a Prey to deceitful Men; and rendering our Efforts Unſucceſsful. And while 'tis the general Cry of this People, <hi>Delenda Eſt Carthago;</hi> How unhappy will it be, if thoſe who are greatly Concerned, and ought to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Vigour and Chearfulneſs, ſhould by with-holding the Help they ought to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford in this Exigence, expoſe their Brethren, and in the End themſelves to Ruin? and bring the Angel's Curſe upon them, Judg. 5. 23. <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, Curſe ye bitterly the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof; becauſe they came not to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord againſt the Mighty.</hi> All the Help they can Afford, will be little enough in this Trying Time. The want of the two great Things required in my Text, <hi>Fearing God, and Honouring the King,</hi> will be the moſt certain Means to hinder our
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008267_0030_102E79BC96002038"/>
Succeſs. If we Repent in Earneſt, and by a thorough Reformation return to God; if we faithfully exert ourſelves in obedience to the King's Demands; if the Meaſures propoſed, be ſteadily and vigorouſly purſued, we have the faireſt Proſpect of Succeſs we ever ſaw.—We truſt your Honours will not be wanting in either of theſe, to do your part. It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily foreſeen, that the Conſequence of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Campaign, is like to be Happy or Fatal to this Country. We truſt you will to your utmoſt, promote a Reformation in the Land, and diſcourage Prophaneneſs, Wickedneſs, and Indolence in the Army.—How can we expect to Conquer our Enemies, when by Irreligion and Stupidity at Home, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, Impiety, and Contempt of the God of Hoſts, in the Army, we are daily provoking Heaven and Arming divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt us!</p>
            <p>But however much the Important Affairs of the War, may engroſs your Time and Thoughts; that yet you will not abate of your uſual Beneficence both to Church and State: and in Special that our College may enjoy your Patronage and Protection: That it may be for a Name and a Praiſe, and the Cities of our God may be made glad thereby. And that all Parts of your Adminiſtration being duly Diſpenſed, not only the preſent, but
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008267_0031_102E79BE3008A568"/>
future Generations may riſe up and call you Bleſſed.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Religion and Loyalty be ſo eſſential to the preſent Comfort, and future Happineſs of Mankind; then ſurely it becomes us, my Reverend Fathers and Brethren, to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to the Flock, as well as Zealous Teachers of theſe important Doctrines. For of all Men, we are under the moſt peculiar Obligations, ſo to walk as to pleaſe God: and conſequently to have the Principles of Religion, and Holineſs wrought in our Souls, ſo as to Influence the whole of our Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and what we inculcate by Precept, we enforce by Example.—We may remember, that one Aggravated Circumſtance in that Notable Rebellion of <hi>Chorah</hi> and his Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices; is, that it was Headed by <hi>Levites,</hi> and the Principal Incendiaries, were of the Holy Order; which brought a ſwift and ſtrange Deſtruction, on thoſe Miſerable Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers.</p>
            <p>As Miniſters are like to be uſeful accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Influence, ſo it highly Concerns them to make a proper Uſe of what Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they have. Our Nation yet feels the ſad Effects of unreaſonably urging the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Paſſive Obedience, and Non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in the Support of a <hi>Jacobite</hi> Party, and the Encouragement of Numbers of Male-contents.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008267_0032_102E79C0DFB9BFF8"/>
I wiſh there were no Danger from the oppoſite Extream. But as <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> has hitherto been juſtly Famed for Loyalty as well as Zeal; ſo let us not be wanting in our Places to give all ſuitable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and Example of it: and as far as poſſible to inſtill into our People the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Loyalty and Obedience. And in ſuch a Day as this, when Things bear ſo threatning an Aſpect in Providence, let us not neglect to enforce the neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Reformation. We are now eſpecially to cry Aloud and ſpare not, but lift up our Voice like a Trumpet, and warn the People of their Sins, and Profeſſors of their Tranſgreſſions. While God in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is giving ſo many Tokens of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, He juſtly Expects, that his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours do urge and enforce them, to excite Reformation and Amendment, in his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And may it not be well to encourage and continue the Practice of devoting ſome pittance of Time in every Week to ſocial Prayer; for the Revival of Religion, and the Succeſs of his Majeſty's Arms, both in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> and <hi>America:</hi> Agreeable to the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of many of our Proteſtant Brethren in <hi>Europe,</hi> who, (it ſeems) are much Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, from the gracious Returns they have already received. For the Language of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008267_0033_102E79C49E37A438"/>
ſeems very expreſly to Concur with that of Scripture.<note n="‖" place="bottom">

               <hi>Let the Prieſts, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Lord, weep between the Porch and the Altar, and let them ſay, Spare thy People O Lord, and give not thine Heritage to Reproach, that the Heathen ſhould Rule over them; wherefore ſhould they ſay among the People, where is their God?</hi> Upon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and conſcientious Diſcharge of this our Duty, we have the Encouragement to be Anſwered, as in the next Words, viz. <hi>Then will the Lord be jealous for his Land, and pity his People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Let us be Importunate at the Throne of Grace, at this Day, for the Divine Preſence with our Authority, both Supream and Subordinate: <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <hi>Moſes'</hi>s Hands while the Armies are contending; for if they fall, the Enemy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails: This we muſt do, until the Victory is obtained, and the Cauſe decided. And don't let any Thing be Wanting that is within our Power to do.—And until God in his Providence ſhall prohibit, and ſay, <hi>Pray not for this People;</hi> let the Language of our Practice concur with the Reply of <hi>Samuel; God forbid that we ſhould Ceaſe to Pray for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. And to Conclude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt Obſerve, that Religion is of the greateſt Importance
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008267_0034_102E79C78A758550"/>
to the People, (as well as Rulers) to diſpoſe them to Subject becomingly to proper Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and yield Obedience from Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Conſcience, more than merely of Fear. For if Laws were as well adjuſted as thoſe of <hi>Solon,</hi> or as poſſitive as thoſe of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> of old; they would prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual without ſomething more Coercive than merely their own Reſtrictions. But he that is Actuated by Religion, will cheerfully comply with Duty, and be afraid of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, becauſe he believes that whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth Authority, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God; and that they who reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation. But then, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, really fits Men for this, as well as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins them to it: It Mortifies their Luſts of Pride, Hatred, Revenge, &amp;c. It furniſhes them with a Meek &amp; Quiet Spirit, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces them of the Reaſonableneſs of that great Rule of Equity; <hi>Whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them:</hi> And it Endowes them with Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Truth, Honeſtly and Loyalty.—And in as much as the Moſt High, is pleaſed to Indulge us with thoſe Priviledges and Liberties, whereby we are favoured above many of our Brethren; in that we have our Rulers as at the firſt, and our Judges as at the beginning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And not only have the Liberty
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:008267_0035_102E79C95EB01828"/>
of Chooſing our Rulers from among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but thoſe that are Choſen, are and have been, ſo much an Honour to their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Bleſſing to the People; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Cauſe of God, and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good: <hi>Men that fear God, and eſchew Evil;</hi> That have Served the State with Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs &amp; Conducted with Honour. Since this, I ſay, is our Caſe, it ſhews us the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Obligations we are under, to live quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godlineſs &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty: paying a juſt Defference to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and to eſteem them very highly in Love, for their works ſake. To be Generous in their Support, and Tender of their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and Good Name; and above all to Pray earneſtly to God for them, that they may be Directed in Duty, Supported in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Endowed with the Bleſſings of his Grace and Goodneſs, which ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly fit them for the Rewards of the Faithful.</p>
            <p>And upon this joyful Occaſion, of our ANNIVERSARY ELECTION; While our Eyes do ſee all thoſe Great &amp; Good things, which the Lord hath done for us, and yet continues to us; Should not our Hearts be raiſed in peculiar Strains of Gratitude and Thankfulneſs? And pay our Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Language of <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

29. 11, 12, 13. <hi>Thine, O LORD, is the greatneſs, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majeſty: for all that is in the heaven, and in the earth, is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all. Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reigneſt over all, and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all. Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praiſe thy glorious Name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>—And let us Remember that in the midſt of all theſe Civil Priviledges, our Ingratitude is enhanced and aggravated; while we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Irreligious; Rebels to the Throne and Dignity of Heaven; and all this goodneſs of God, has no Effect to lead us to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: For if like <hi>Capernaum,</hi> we have been Exalted with Priviledges, like them, we muſt expect to be caſt down, if we Miſimprove and Abuſe them.</p>
