            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following diſcourſe was written for the moſt part at Paris, and ſerved as an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able relaxation from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer ſtudies in which I was, at that time, engaged. Our travelling together gave me an opportunity of ſubmitting the performance to your critical eye, and it affords me a ſingular ſatisfaction to acknowlege, that, in ſeveral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, it has been greatly amended by your candid and judicious remarks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010082_0004_0F7C949A79E3F240"/>UPON ſuch an occaſion as this, I ſhould deem myſelf ungrateful indeed, was I to withold the little tribute I have in my power to pay to that genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine worth and diſintereſted friendſhip, which I have experienced in you.</p>
            <p>SURE I am that a perſon of your ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſpoſition, whoſe heart glows with the utmoſt warmth of ſocial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe mind is enriched with the treaſures of ancient and modern learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and whoſe taſte has been improved and refined, by an acquaintance and converſation with men of the firſt rank in life and of the greateſt abilities in the learned world, muſt be eminently uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to mankind, and particularly adorn and bleſs the land wherein providence calls him to reſide. With great reaſon, therefore, may we hope to ſee you become a diſtinguiſhed ornament to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. With great reaſon may the place of your nativity claim the advantages which ariſe from ſuch abilities, and
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010082_0005_0F7C949B3505DE28"/>
from a genius that was formed and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in her own boſom. Your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has much to expect in waiting the return of a ſon bleſſed with ſo many uſeful endowments; and I well know that, amongſt your many other virtues, the love of your country prevails too much in your breaſt to let her ſuſtain a diſappointment.</p>
            <p>OPULENCE and generoſity ſeldom go hand in hand. The gifts of fortune are rarely accompanied with a ſpirit to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them in deeds of charity and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted benevolence.</p>
            <p>IT is yours, Sir, to ſoar above the ſordid views of vulgar minds, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſublime pleaſures of a tender and ſympathizing humanity, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways carries its own reward, in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfacton that flows from the exerciſe of ſo precious a gift of divine bounty.</p>
            <p>THERE are no connections in life more honourable than thoſe which we form with men of learning and virtue.
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010082_0006_0F7C949C286CA9D0"/>
I cannot but congratulate myſelf, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, on the ſtrict intimacy with which you have ſo long indulged me, and, at the ſame time, be thankful to you for the advantages it has often procured me in foreign parts.</p>
            <p>DURING an abſence of five years from my country and friends, whilſt I was engaged in ſuch purſuits as were indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to fit me for more extenſive uſefulneſs in my profeſſion, the almoſt uninterrupted enjoyment of your company, or correſpondence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed much to make ſuch a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more eaſy and ſupportable. It will always give me unſpeakable pleaſure to reflect upon the variety of ſcenes through which we have paſſed, and the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and improvement we have met with, in viſiting the principal cities and ſeats of ſcience in Great-Britain, Holland, France and Italy; places ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated for the birth or reſidence of men of the moſt illuſtrious genius in the

world, and diſtinguiſhed for the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of manners, polite arts and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature.</p>
            <p>THESE are the ſeveral conſiderations that have induced me to preſent you with this performance. Happy ſhould I have thought myſelf, if a little more leiſure had enabled me to render it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more worthy your notice. Such as it is, however, I requeſt you to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it as a ſmall teſtimony of my perſonal regard and affection for you. Whatever may be the merit or ſucceſs of the work itſelf, I ſhall always rejoice that it has given me an opportunity of telling the world, how much I reſpect your character, and what an high va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue I place upon your friendſhip.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE delay in publiſhing my addreſs on the inſtitution of Medical ſchools aroſe from the indiſpenſable calls of buſineſs. It has given me an opportunity, however, of hearing the opinion of many people upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs; but more particularly upon what relates to my propoſed method of practiſing phyſic.</p>
            <p>MY intention with regard to the latter, having been made known by general converſations only, I find has been often miſunderſtood. No wonder then, if, in conſequence thereof, it has been ſometimes greatly miſrepreſented.</p>
            <p>THIS has determined me to commit to the preſs the plan of practice by which I deſign to regulate myſelf as much as poſſible; and to deliver my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents very briefly on the expediency of a regular and diſtinct practice in the ſeveral branches of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. The public will then be able to judge more
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:010082_0009_0F7C94A0C5B1A058"/>
clearly of the propriety of thoſe meaſures, which from a full perſuaſion of their great utility, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to recommend.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I purpoſe to confine myſelf, in practice, to thoſe caſes which belong moſt immediately to the office of a Phyſician, that I may preſcribe for and attend ſuch caſes to greater advantage. I ſhall therefore avoid, all I can, interfering in the proper buſineſs of ſurgery viz. m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ual operation.</p>
            <p>I DO not mean however to refuſe to innoculate for the ſmall-pox, where my patients or their friends object to employ another hand to make the inciſion. This may frequently happen, although there is no more difficulty of art required in it, than in cutting an iſſue and inſerting a pea, or than in cupping and bleeding.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I propoſe, in ſuch caſes as ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to attend in conſultation with other Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, on the ſame terms as thoſe of character enter into conſultation with one another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall give my opinion in writing on the complaints of patients at a diſtance from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, whenever the hiſtory of the caſe is properly drawn up and tranſmitted to me for advice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:010082_0010_0F7C94A153DCFDD0"/>Fourthly, In ſuch caſes of ſurgery as require con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, or the uſe of medicines, I am willing to attend, to preſcribe, conſult, or adviſe; but not to perform any operation myſelf, or dreſs any wound.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>IN REGARD TO THE APOTHECARY AND SURGEON.</head>
               <p>IT may be proper here to acquaint the public, that, for the better carrying on this plan into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Mr. <hi>David Leighton,</hi> a gentleman of abilities and integrity, educated in Great-Britain both in phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and ſurgery, has accompanied me hither. To him I ſend to make up my preſcriptions. But patients are allowed to chooſe any other apothecary to put up their medicines, or what ſurgeon they pleaſe for the operative part. What I expect from them is a proper compenſation for my advice and attendance as a phyſician. The medicines and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are to be conſidered as a diſtinct and ſeparate charge. Mr. <hi>Leighton</hi> has imported a large aſſortment of medicines, in which no expence has been ſpared to have every thing of the beſt in its kind. They have been prepared with particular care by Meſſrs <hi>Silvanus</hi> and <hi>Timothy Bevan,</hi> Druggiſts in London, whoſe known ſkill and reputation in that buſineſs are too well eſtabliſhed, both in Great-Britain and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, to need further recommendation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010082_0011_0F7C94A218071B98"/>Mr. LEIGHTON will oblige himſelf to put up ſuch preſcriptions as are ordered, in the beſt manner, and with the utmoſt fidelity and care, as well as at the moſt moderate rate.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>AS TO FEES.</head>
               <p>I always mean that theſe ſhall be moderate, adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the circumſtances of this place, of the patient and the attendance he may require.</p>
               <p>As a rule of conduct to ſuch as are quite unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the regular practice of phyſic, let them inform themſelves what is the united expence for Medicines and attendance, as charged by the practitioners of eminence in this place. In ſuch caſes as can be exactly aſcertained, I ſhall require no more from them, than they would be obliged to pay to others, as in the caſe of innoculation and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the ſmall pox; allowance being made for the Medicines. The ſame rule, as far as it can be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fevers and other diſorders, might be applyed.</p>
               <p>PRACTITIONERS in many caſes make an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced charge on their Medicines, ſo as to include for attendance. This is done to make up for the patients deficiency in fees, than which, when it is will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and not the effect of ignorance in the patient, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more equitable, or more expedient, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010082_0012_0F7C94A2B939DF30"/>
charging for attendance under its proper name. For Practitioners muſt be paid for their time and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, as well as for their Medicines, under what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever name they make the charge. Indeed the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive practice otherwiſe would be inſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a family in a becoming manner, as the greateſt part of their time is employed in viſiting the ſick. The paying of a phyſician for attendance and the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary for his Medicines apart is certainly the moſt eligible mode of practice, both to patient and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner. The apothecary then, who is not obliged to ſpend his time in viſiting patients, can afford to make up medicines at a reaſonable price; and it is as deſirable, as juſt in itſelf, that patients ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fees for attendance, whatever it may be thought to deſerve. They ought to know what it is they really pay for Medicines, and what for phyſical ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and attendance.</p>
               <p>NOBODY, I believe, will deny that the practice of rating Medicines, at ſuch a price as to include the charge for Medicines and attendance, is liable to groſs impoſitions on the part of ignorant medicaſters, too many of whom ſwarm in every city. Patients who are kept in ignorance of what price Medicines are, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered ſeparately, and what is the value of phyſical ſkill and attendance, naturally think the original coſt of Medicines, which are comparatively cheap, to be very dear, and undervalue the ſkill of a phyſician,

his toil of ſtudy and his expence of time and money in his education, which have often amounted to very large ſums and to many years ſpent abroad in queſt of knowledge, as if they were of no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>THE levelling of all kind of practicioners ſo much with illiterate pretenders, who have art enough to gain employ, however ill qualified in that of healing diſeaſes, has a tendency to deter perſons, otherwiſe of juſt and liberal ſentiments, from putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a further expence to gain knowledge, than what is ſufficient to make money. This is to make a vile trade of phyſic, inſtead of a noble profeſſion, which as it certainly is, ſo it ought to be eſteemed.</p>
               <p>I HAVE been told more than once, upon reaſoninrg on the ſubject, that people here are uſed to this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and dont love to change old cuſtoms. What is it more than to ſay,
<q>"Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur</q>
               </p>
               <p>IF people chooſe to be deceived, even let us keep them, in their deception."?</p>
               <p>INSTEAD of making a charge of fees, I willingly leave to the patients themſelves to give what
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:010082_0014_0F7C94A452B0AB00"/>
they pleaſe, upon my diſmiſſion from further atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, or as ſoon after their recovery as ſhall be thought convenient, without ſpecifying any demand, unleſs where patients particularly require it. This I look for to prevent the neceſſity of making a book charge of fees, which is never done in any liberal profeſſion.</p>
               <p>BY thus leaving the fee in a great meaſure, of wholly, to the free will and circumſtances of the patient, a phyſician may be employed by the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling claſs of people as well as the rich.</p>
               <p>MANY who have no adequate notion of the true value of attendance, or what rule is obſerved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, may wiſh rather to be directed what fee to pay for attendance, being deſirous on one hand, to avoid the appearance of being deficient in generoſity, and on the other hand willing to recompence the phyſician for his care, without unneceſſary prodigality. Such perſons, upon intimation of their deſires, it is to be hoped, will always find themſelves fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this particular.</p>
               <p>AS to attending poor patients gratis, and giving them my beſt advice; I ſhall chearfullv take my ſhare of that kind of practice with my brethern of the faculty. For I ſhall always eſteem it a favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:010082_0015_0F7C94A4F7B14B30"/>
that puts it in my power to adminiſter relief to perſons, whoſe indigence forbids them to expect it upon any other terms.</p>
               <p>THESE articles, I preſume, will effectually remove the objection which has been moſt ſtrongly urged, viz. that my method of practice would only ſuit the wealthy; and will prove that the expence to the patient is not greater, on the plan I have adopted, than in the common method of practice.</p>
               <p>IT is true that, upon my firſt arrival, I expreſſed my deſire of being paid for a certain number of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, at a piſtole the firſt viſit, as a retaining fee, and a dollar for every viſit afterwards.—It was not my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to require more than one fee per day, although I might wait on the patient oftner, nor yet every day that I viſited once, where a diſeaſe of a lingering nature, or requiring particular care, would render my attendance expenſive. A retaining fee I expected to receive from the rich, not from the poor; and had firmly reſolved in no caſe to receive more, fees, than ſufficient to pay me for the value of my time and trouble of attendance. But for want of ſuitable opportunities of rendering this better known, I daily found that my good intention was in ſome meaſure fruſtrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="ix" facs="unknown:010082_0016_0F7C94A5DA6DA3E8"/>THIS, and the advice of ſome judicious friends to endeavour to prevent the ill effects of prejudice, made me reſolve to attempt ſuch an alteration as might be better ſuited, at this time, to the cuſtoms and circumſtances of the people.</p>
               <p>THE preceeding plan I have ever ſince conſtantly followed, to my entire ſatisfaction, and I hope to that of my patients. Truth requires of me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the public, that I have always found, as far as my practice has hitherto given me an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of judging, that the inſinuation, which has been made to deter me from this mode of practice, viz. <hi>that people are too narrow minded here, and ſhow no generoſity to a phyſician, only employing a doctor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is cheap or lives near to them,</hi> is utterly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. In moſt inſtances I have found their generoſity has much exceeded my expectations.</p>
               <p>ONE article more I have to mention under this head. It may frequently happen, in viſiting my friends and acquaintance who employ me in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that themſelves, their children or ſervants, may have ſlight complaints, for which they would be glad to have advice, but do not think them of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance enough to call in a phyſician, who may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect fees for little ailments. Such perſons may always command my advice in theſe maſters without a fee.</p>

               <head>THE NECESSITY OF REGULATING THE PRACTICE OF PHYSIC.</head>
               <p>IT will be readily acknowledged by every one that allows himſelf to reflect upon it, that ſome regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in regard to a Phyſicians attendance upon the ſick is now become highly requiſite, Formerly, when the city did not occupy much above half the extent, practice was much more manageable than it is at preſent. Living was then cheap. Within my own memory, every article of expence was leſs by almoſt one half. So that what ſuited the circumſtances of the place and people then does not ſuit them now. Yet we may believe the knowledge of Phyſic has been cultivated all along with conſiderable appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. A medical education is at leaſt become much more expenſive, and a man has little chance, if he keeps free from empiriciſm, to get a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable living by phyſic now, unleſs he has ſpent ſome years in an expenſive education in Europe. Is it not then more equitable to be paid for atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, than to live by advancing the price of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines?</p>
               <p>I AM not urging theſe as arguments for a more expenſive practice, but for an improvement of it, by ſeparating phyſic from ſurgery and pharmacy, which
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:010082_0018_0F7C94A745CE9E38"/>
I think incompatible with them, at leaſt according to the plan of education I have followed, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſome of the moſt eminent and ſkillful judges of medical ſcience of any in Great Britain.</p>
               <p>WHAT reaſonable objection can be then offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt an improvement in the preſent method of the practice of phyſic, which, to a man in great buſineſs, is by every one allowed to be the moſt ſlaviſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion known in this part of the world.</p>
               <p>EVERY mechanic has a certain portion of time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for a relaxation from buſineſs, and for the enjoyment of ſocial happineſs, Phyſicians have next to none, but they are obliged to be at the call of the ſick, every hour in the night as well as of the day. Were they born ſlaves to the public and not child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren? or, for ſuch a voluntary ſurrender of their liberty and eaſe as is neceſſary to practiſe conſcientiouſ]y, are they to have no compenſation? Is it thought an unreaſonable demand to be paid for a toilſome, but neceſſary attendance, amidſt objects of the moſt mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtreſs, which deprives them much of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of their own family and of a number of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, which every other profeſſion allows of without detriment? Where is the encouragement for a man to baniſh himſelf from all the endearing tyes of friends and relations, to ſpend the prime of
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:010082_0019_0F7C94A80296FAA8"/>
life, and often the bulk of his fortune, to adminiſter more ſkillful aid to the calamities of his diſtreſſed fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mortals, if he is to be conſidered as entitled only to the ſame gratuity with thoſe who employ all their time at home, in getting money, inſtead of ſpending it for the public good? or is he to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed no more, than if, in acquiring this knowledge, he had been ſupported at a public expence?—let unbiaſſed reaſon and juſtice determine.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry that the objections, which have been made to my propoſed method of practice, have laid me under the diſagreeable neceſſity of mentioning the kind of education I have had to qualify me for my profeſſion, and to afford me a reaſonable expectation of a living from my advice and attendance.</p>
               <p>IT is now more than fifteen years ſince I began the ſtudy of medicine in this city, which I have proſecuted ever ſince without interruption. During the firſt ſix years I ſerved an apprenticeſhip with Dr. JOHN REDMAN, who then did, and ſtills continues to enjoy a moſt juſtly acquired reputation in this city for ſuperior knowledge and extenſive practice in phyſic. At the ſame time I had an opportunity of being acquainted with the practice of other eminent phyſicians in this place, particularly of all the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:010082_0020_0F7C94A8B497DA18"/>
to the hoſpital, whoſe preſcriptions I put up there above the ſpace of one year. The term of my apprenticeſhip being expired, I devoted myſelf for four years to a military life, principally with a view to become more ſkillful in my profeſſion; being engaged, the whole of that time, in a very extenſive practice in the army, amongſt diſeaſes of every kind. The laſt five years I have ſpent in Europe, under the moſt celebrated maſters in every branch of Medicine, and ſpared no labour or expence to ſtore my mind with an extenſive acquaintance in every ſcience, that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any way to the duty of a phyſician; having in that time expended, in this purſuit, a ſum of money, of which the very intereſt would prove no contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble income. With what ſucceſs this has been done others are to judge, and not myſelf.</p>
               <p>Thus I have arrived at the middle age of life, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to lay up treaſures of uſeful knowledge, before I commence a ſettled practice; and yet I have been told, that to expect to gain a ſupport here by my medical advice and attendance only, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a ſurgeon and apothecary too in order to help out, is to forget that I was born an American. I am very happy that my country has always diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered too much of a laudable ambition to excell in every branch of polite literature, and has taken too much pleaſure in the reputation of her ſons, to fill
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:010082_0021_0F7C94ABB60A2310"/>
me with apprehenſion that an education in phyſic will be accounted too expenſive, ſuch as I have thought neceſſary to qualify myſelf for practiſing my profeſſion with eaſe of mind to myſelf and with benefit to the community.</p>
               <p>As far as I can learn, every body approves of my plan for inſtituting medical ſchools, and I have the honour of being appointed a public profeſſor for teaching, phyſic in the college here. Can any man, the leaſt acquainted with the nature of that arduous taſk, once imagine it poſſible for me to acquit myſelf in that ſtation, in an honourable or uſeful manner, and yet be engaged in one continued round of practice in ſurgery and pharmacy, as well as phyſic?</p>
               <p>To prepare for a courſe of lectures every year re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſome leiſure, and a mind undiſturbed with too great a variety of purſuits. So that my uſefulneſs as a profeſſor makes it abſolutely neceſſary for me to follow that method of practice, which alone appears to be calculated to anſwer that end.<note n="*" place="bottom">Quick caren alternâ requie durabile nen eſt, Haec reparat virez, feſſaque membra novat.</note>

               <head>ON THE ADVANTAGES OF A SEPARATE AND REGULAR PRACTICE OF PHYSIC, SURGERY AND PHARMACY.</head>
               <p>In the more laborious occupation of life, as in building a houſe or a ſhip, a great variety as well as a great number of artizans are employed, but all in different departments.</p>
               <p>IN the leſs laborious callings we obſerve the like prudent regulations, thus in making a pipe, a button or a pin, a variety of hands, no leſs commonly than five, ſix, or ſeven different artiſts unite their induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. By this means they finſh more work in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited time, and can afford to ſell it at a cheaper rate, than they could, if every individual was employed in all the ſeparate branches. But each having a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular province aſſigned to himſelf, while all conſpire in one uniform plan, they become more ſkillful and dextrous in their reſpective parts, and all more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubſervient to one end. Are the good qualities of accuracy, diſpatch and cheapneſs, not to ſpeak of the greater perfection of the work, no recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the manner of doing it?</p>
               <p>WHY ſhould the more difficult, but more ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and liberal arts, ſcorn to be taught wiſdom from their example? Is it eaſier to underſtand the
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:010082_0023_0F7C94AD3504F3C8"/>
intricate ſtructure of the animal frame, the work of God, than to learn the conſtruction of any machine, as a watch or clock, the work of human invention? Or are the ſprings and movements of the former, ſo divinely adjuſted, more eaſily managed and put to rights when in diſorder, than the wheels of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? or does the preſervation of this in a ſound ſtate require leſs ſtudy, knowledge, and conduct?</p>
               <p>THE human body is certainly one of the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound machines in nature. Medicine is one of the nobleſt and moſt difficult of arts, made up of a number of ſciences different from each other. The practice of phyſic requires deliberation, reaſoning, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and experience. Surgery calls for different powers and qualifications rarely uniting in one man. Are theſe then all to be blended with the apothecary, the botaniſt, and chymiſt, which ought to be, and are each of them ſeparate and diſtinct in their very nature? Whilſt we labour amidſt ſuch a variety of purſuits, all improvement muſt be at a ſtand. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, let each cultivate his reſpective branch apart, the phyſician, ſurgeon, apothecary &amp;c. the knowledge of medicine will be then daily improved, and it may be practiſed with greater accuracy and ſkill as well as a leſs expence.</p>
               <p>PREJUDICE may here aſk, how can a phyſician practiſe with advantage, if he does not equally pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:010082_0024_0F7C94ADFB6A6360"/>
every branch of his profeſſon? or how ſhall he know that the Medicines are good, which he orders, if he does hot prepare them himſelf?</p>
               <p>ANSWER, It is not only expedient, but neceſſary that a phyſician ſhould have a general and extenſive knowledge of the whole art, and be acquainted with the principles of every branch of his profeſſion. Thus the general of an army ſhould be acquainted with every part of military ſcience, and underſtand the whole detail of military duty, from that of colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel down to a private centinel. But there is no need that he ſhould act as a pioneer and dig in a trench. Where a proper ſubordination is wanting, there is a perverſion of all practical knowledge. No more then is a phyſician obliged, from his office, to handle a knife with a ſurgeon; to cull herbs with the bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt; to diſtill ſimples with the chymiſt; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound drugs with the apothecary. Can he be more ſure however that his Medicines are genuine, if he does not collect his own herbs and roots as a botaniſt, or diſtill with the chymiſt, than he can, if, omitting theſe, he ſhould ſtick to the plaiſter-pan and ſpatula, or the peſtle and mortar?</p>
               <p>BUT practitioners in great buſineſs never do, or can do the buſineſs of an apothecary in this place, themſelves. They have apprentices for
<pb n="xviii" facs="unknown:010082_0025_0F7C94AED48DB030"/>
the purpoſe. After viſiting the ſick, do not their apprentices make up their preſcriptions? I would aſk, is not an apothecary thoroughly acquainted with the art of compounding and making up Medicines as ſkillful in it as an apprentice? Is not a man educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the profeſſion to be truſted in preference to one who is only learning that buſineſs? or has the maſter, who may be called from place to place to attend other caſes of ſurgery, or ſee other patients, always time to wait for medicines to be made up under his eye?</p>
               <p>THESE queries are eaſy enough for every one to decide upon, without being brought up to the ſtudy of phyſic. Will he not therefore do a worthy action, whoever ſhall ſteadily apply himſelf to remove the difficulties which are in the way of regular practice? Will he not do real ſervice to his country and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for the good effects of which poſterity may thank him? Who then would heſitate to rank himſelf amongſt the foremoſt claſs of thoſe who ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in a work of ſuch real benefit to the public?</p>
               <p>HAVING thus fully explained the method I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for practiſing phyſic in this place, I appeal to the impartial judgment of the public to decide upon the queſtion. Is it to be deemed an idle innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or is it not rather an improvement of practice in Philadelphia, to adopt a plan conformable to what is obſerved in great Britain and all poliſhed countries,
<pb n="xix" facs="unknown:010082_0026_0F7C94AF79250740"/>
as far as the circumſtances of this place admit? I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs myſelf open to conviction, and ſhall allow due weight to every reaſonable argument that may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to my plan. When I am rationally convinced that I have been in an error, I ſhall readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and retract my ſentiments, which I hope, till then, I may be allowed to continue, without being charged with an innovating ſpirit.</p>
               <p>WHAT remains yet to be done is to endeavour to elucidate a few paſſages, which have been thought exceptionable in the diſcourſe by particular perſons.</p>
               <p>IN ſome paragraphs, the opinions and practice of the faculty of phyſic in this place have been thought to have been too indiſcriminately condemned.</p>
               <p>FAR be it from me to merit this charge, or to have entertained ſentiments derogatory from a ſet of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, many of whom I rank amongſt my principle friends in the city, and highly eſteem for their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and abilities in their profeſſion, to which they do great honour. To have made a nominal diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was never my deſign. It cannot therefore in juſtice be imputed to me as a fault to have avoided, all I could, every thing which had the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of particularity, and to have endeavoured to ſuggeſt an improvement of practice, without aiming at practitioners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xx" facs="unknown:010082_0027_0F7C94B053E83CB8"/>I DOUBT not that every practitioner here of edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, experience and integrity, has purſued the plan which, in his opinion, was beſt ſuited to the place and people. But as circumſtances alter, ſo does the propriety of particular eſtabliſhed cuſtoms, which gradually give way to others better ſuited to thoſe changes which happen in a courſe of years. May I not hope to meet with the ſame candour that I ſhow to others, and be admitted to act from the ſame honeſt principles, in recommending what I think an improvement of practice, that I allow thoſe who have purſued a plan different from mine?</p>
               <p>WHEREVER there is the leaſt appearance of being particular, or wherever I have ſpoken expreſsly of the practitioners of this town, it has been in the moſt becoming manner and without the leaſt cenſure, well knowing how much I myſelf need the indulgence of others.</p>
               <p>"Mecum habito et novi quam ſit mihi curta ſuppellex."</p>
               <p>IN confirmation hereof, I ſhall adduce a few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to which the reader may refer. Thus I have ſaid, p. 18. "and here we may congratulate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that in this, and ſome of the large neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towns, we have a number of ſkillful phyſicians
<pb n="xxi" facs="unknown:010082_0028_0F7C94B108750618"/>
and expert ſurgeons, qualified by genius, education and experience, to take charge of the health of their fellow creatures." And p 30. "The city of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, adorned with a ſet of eminent practitioner draws to it a great number of pupils, from the neighbouring parts, to learn the arts of phyſic and ſurgery." Indeed the only part in which I have been particular, and there it was unavoidable, is in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the phyſicians of the hoſpital, which I have done in terms of the higheſt reſpect. p. 31.</p>
               <p>It is true, I have endeavoured, as well as I was able, lo deſcribe the miſchievous effects that enſue from ignorance and preſumption, when young men enter upon the practice of Medicine before they are duly inſructed in the important duties of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, See p. 23. 24.</p>
               <p>I have likewiſe urged the neceſſity of joining ſtudy with practice, and availing ourſelves of the medical diſcoveries and improvements made by others. On the authority of a very learned ſociety, I have alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved of the conduct of thoſe, who, from preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice affecting a ſimplicity, (which might often miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead them) diſdain thoſe perſons who divide their time between ſtudy and practice. I have likewiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, on the ſame authority, that novices enlightened by the diſcoveries, which theſe practitioners ſhut
<pb n="xxii" facs="unknown:010082_0029_0F7C94B1F80840E8"/>
their eyes againſt, would in their turn with reaſon deſpiſe them, when grown old in their errors," ſee p. 42 and 47.</p>
               <p>BUT I have no where intentionally aimed the ſhaft of cenſure at any one, or attempted the character of a particular man; much leſs have I dared to attack indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately a whole body of men. As far as I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in painting the errors or faults of any, I have endeavoured to repreſent general actions of men, ſuch as they are, and not the picture of individuals. Yet, as <hi>Le Sage</hi> has juſtly remarked, there are ſome perſons who cannot read, and I ſay there are others who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hear, without making an application of thoſe vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or ridiculous characters which they learn from an author. With him I declare to all who have ſuch a malicious propenſity, that they are in the wrong to apply the portraits which they may find here exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; nor let any reader take for his own what may equally belong to another, otherwiſe he will fooliſhly expoſe himſelf, as Phaedrus ſays,
<q>"Stulté nudabit animi conſcientiam."</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE notice I have here given is, I hope, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent therefore to exculpate me from the groundleſs charge of having unjuſtly reflected upon, or cenſured the conduct of others,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="xxiii" facs="unknown:010082_0030_0F7C94B275AAD0B8"/>SOME, It is ſaid, have thought, that I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the difficulties of attaining to the knowledge of phyſic in too ſtrong terms, and have enumerated ſo many qualifications as requiſite to acquire any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable knowledge of the medical art, that I rather deter ſtudents, than encourage them in attempting to compleat their ſtudics and to become ſkillful in their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>TO theſe I reply, that I have been far from exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating matters, and have leſt much unſaid, on purpoſe to avoid diſcouraging their eager purſuit. If we cannot arrive at abſolute perfection in ſcience, let us not abandon ourſelves to a criminal indolence, but ſtrive to approach that degree of knowledge which is attainable by induſtry, and we cannot fail of being eminently ſkillful in the healing art and highly uſeful to mankind.</p>
               <p>OTHERS, I am informed, as if they were afraid of engaging in too great an expence, have ſaid that I have inſiſted too much on the neceſſity of ſtudents attending lectures in every different branch of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. They ſeem to imagine if they hear lectures upon Anatomy only, the branch which I have firſt mentioned in my diſcourſe, that they can eaſily make themſelves matters of all the other branches of medicine by reading. I bluſh for thoſe who thus
<pb n="xxiv" facs="unknown:010082_0031_0F7C94B5AC6451A0"/>
expoſe either their ignorance or their avarice. Why are fhey not equally contented with ſuch a ſhare of knowledge in anatomy, as they can gain from books, ſince this ſcience can be better painted to the eye, than ſome of the other branches of medicine, which are altogether as neceſſary to be known by a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician? Are not anatomical plates and deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as intelligible to a ſtudent, as the philoſophical ſtudies of chymiſtry, phyſiology, and pathology are, from a mere courſe of reading? or is it of leſs conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to gain a ſyſtematic knowledge of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria medica, or practice of medicine, than of anatomy, which is of no other uſe to a phyſician than as it contributes its ſhare towards explaining what diſeaſes are? The others furniſh him with the means and manner of performing the cure, and require, at leaſt, as much labour and explanation as anatomy itſelf demands.</p>
               <p>THE worthy and learned Doctor Lewis is of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, "that the medicinal hiſtory, or the knowledge of the powers and effects of medicine in the human body, though apparently a moſt eſſential branch of the healing art, has been far more incuriouſly culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, and ſtill perhaps continues leſs cleared from the errors of former ages than any other ſcience." Another writer on the ſame ſubject ſays, "it is an idle ſuppoſition to ſet out upon, that there are the
<pb n="xxv" facs="unknown:010082_0032_0F7C94B69A749D10"/>
works of good chymiſts and good naturaliſts extant, and that from thoſe a ſufficient ſyſtem of information on this important head may be compiled. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile with judgement requires as much knowledge of the ſubject as to write well upon it. No man is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified to execute this to advantage, who is not able to have written what he borrows. Even the beſt and moſt authentic books on theſe ſubjects have their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, moſt of them too many; and while he who is himſelf defficient in the knowledge of the ſubject, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be liable to take in theſe with the reſt, it is evident what ſort of dapendance ought to be placed on his collections."</p>
               <p>WHATEVER anatomical ſkill a man may boaſt, yet if he is ignorant of the virtues of Medicines, or of their changes from differently compounding them together, or knows not what are the true indications in the cure, or relief of diſeaſes, he may value him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for expertneſs in diffection, but every ſenſible man will hold him cheap as a phyſician.</p>
               <p>NOBODY, who is anxious to be ſkillful in the divine art of healing, will be a niggard of the neceſſary trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and expence of rendering himſelf intelligent in every thing his profeſſion requires he ſhould know. Whoever is ſparing of theſe has no cauſe of complaint, if he is rewarded only according to his merit, unleſs
<pb n="xxvi" facs="unknown:010082_0033_0F7C94B6F63E2390"/>
he would invert ſcripture and the laws of reaſon, and caſting his eyes on thoſe who have ſowed plentifully in knowledge and reaped but little pecuniary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from thence, think, from ſowing ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, he has a better title to expect that his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhould be rewarded with a bountiful harved.</p>

            <head>TO THE TRUSTEES <hi>Of the</hi> COLLEGE, AND THE CITIZENS <hi>Of</hi> PHILADELPHIA.</head>
            <p>GENTLEMEN,</p>
            <p>THE cultivation of Science, and the progreſs of arts have juſtly merited the regard of every age and country. I eſteem myſelf happy, therefore, that I have an opportunity of delivering my ſentiments before ſo candid and learned an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, upon a ſubject which reſpects the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ement of the moſt uſeful knowledge, and the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing credit of this inſtitution;—a ſubject as import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant as can well be imagined to employ our ſerious deliberation, or animate our warmeſt purſuit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:010082_0037_0F7C94BA04EB71F8"/>WHAT I am to propoſe is a ſcheme for tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Medical Science</hi> into this ſeminary, and for the improvement of every branch of the healing art.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be confeſſed that in a knowledge of the ſupreme <hi>Being,</hi> and of the duties which we owe to him, conſiſts the <hi>ſublime</hi> of true philoſophy.</p>
            <p>THIS is the moſt intereſting purſuit of rational creatures, as it regards the ſoul and conſtitutes the higheſt happineſs.</p>
            <p>A KNOWLEDGE of the duties which we owe to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, reſulting from the relation in which we ſtand to one another, is an object of the next importance. After this, whatever relates to the welfare of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſerves our moſt immediate concern.—Life, when burdened with diſeaſe, is but a complication of woes. Health is that choice ſeaſoning which gives a reliſh to all our enjoyments. As the end of medical ſcience is to reſtore and preſerve health, the welfare of every individual, of whatever age or ſex, is concerned in the improvement of it amongſt them.</p>
            <p>MEDICINE is a ſcience as important in its object, as it is difficult in the acquiſition. It is very exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in its reſearches, and preſuppoſes the knowledge of many other ſciences. The cultivation of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:010082_0038_0F7C94BD80AF79E0"/>
no ſmall abilities, and demands of thoſe who engage in the arduous purſuit an enlarged and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent mind. But notwitſtanding theſe difficulties, this ſcience muſt ſtill be productive of very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and honour to a ſeminary of learning, to a city and to a country; where the wiſdom of well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed laws, and the encouragement given to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of it, are ſufficient to procure it an effectual eſtabiſhment.</p>
            <p>A THIRST of knowledge and a ſpirit of inquiry are natural to man. It merits our endeavours to direct theſe to worthy objects. Whilſt we are anxious to inform ourſelves what were the cuſtoms of former ages, by what boundaries diſtant kingdoms are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, what were the rites and ceremonies of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations, or what flowers bloom in the remote Indies;—ſhall we have no deſire of ſtudying what more immediately relates to ourſelves? ſhall we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to examine into the divinely curious and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſtructure of our own bodies? are we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in applying our purſuits, to find out the nature of thoſe multiplied calamities to which the human frame is unavoidably expoſed, and the means of removing or aſſwaging thoſe calamities?</p>
            <p>TO hint at the means whereby we may accompliſh the inſtitution of medical ſchools in this city, and to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010082_0039_0F7C94BE062ECF38"/>
point out ſome of the moſt conſiderable advantages it muſt be attended with, is the taſk in which I am here to engage. Upon a ſubject ſo new in this place, and ſo pregnant with the moſt intereſting conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I flatter myſelf you will hear candidly what I have to impart; and let the goodneſs of my intention apologize for any inaccuracies in the execution.</p>
            <p>IT may be proper, in the firſt place, to give a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral view of the boundaries of medicine, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent provinces of this extenſive ſcience; to ſhow its preſent condition in America; the difficulties which accompany its ſtudy, and the impracticability of making any great progreſs therein, till it is put on a better footing. Theſe being explained, the means of effecting that end, and the benefits ariſing from thence will be more eaſily apprehended.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the learned Gaubius, <q>
                  <hi>Medicine is the guardian of life and healthy againſt death and diſeaſe.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gaub. Inſtitut. patholog. Medic.</note> To be more particular. The Art of healing conſiſts in a thorough knowledge of the human oeconomy; what conſtitutes health; what are the diſeaſes, as well internal as external to which the body is expoſed; their ſeat, cauſes, and ſymptoms; and the means of applying with ſkill, judgment, and addreſs, the various remedies adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cure or mitigate them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:010082_0040_0F7C94BE7B771D30"/>FROM this view of medicine, we readily percieve Its great extent; we learn the principles on which is founded the diviſion of it, into the Study of Phyſic, more properly ſpeaking, and into Surgery.</p>
            <p>THE former is converſant about the cure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſeaſes, and ſuch complaints as require the uſe of medicines. The latter principally regards external diſorders, and thoſe inward maladies which need the manual aſſiſtance of a dexterous operator to relieve them. We likewiſe underſtand the reaſon of ſo many diſtinct branches of medical ſtudy; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious knowledge of which, both in the Phyſician and Surgeon, are requiſite in order to qualify them for ſucceſsful practice.</p>
            <p>THE neceſſity of diſcriminating between phyſic and ſurgery will more manifeſtly appear when we conſider, that they are diſtinct in their nature, and that either of them is an art, ſufficient of itſelf to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the induſtry of one man to cultivate.</p>
            <p>THE various branches of knowledge which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſcience of medicine, are Anatomy, Materia Medica, Botany, Chymiſtry, the Theory of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, and the practice.</p>
            <p>THESE will be fully known by defining them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately; by ſhowing what weight they bear in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010082_0041_0F7C94BF7A936C20"/>
ballance of healing arts; their relation to each other; and how far the knowledge of them reſpectively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes towards the cure of diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANATOMY, taken in a general ſenſe, conſiſts in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtructure of the animal body; conſidered in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, it implies a knowledge of the frame and organization of the human body.</hi> It teaches of what kind of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance all the parts are compoſed; it ſhews their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, texture, firmneſs, connection, and relation to each other. From this ſource we derive our firſt knowledge of the feat of diſeaſes; of the proper or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper arangement of parts; of the danger or ſafety of an operation; and learn the beſt manner of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with dexterity and ſucceſs; In ſtudying the art of healing we commonly begin with Anatomy, and very juſtly, for, unacquainted with this, it is impoſſible to learn the functions of the body in a healthy ſtate, to know of what kind its diſeaſes are, or how to remedy them.</p>
            <p>IT is Anatomy that guides the doubtful ſtep of the young votary of medicine through an obſcure laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, where a variety of minute objects preſent themſelves in ſuch a group as, at firſt, to perplex his imagination. It is Anatomy which unravels the firſt difficulties in his purſuit; it lays open to his view the diverſity of parts, their combination, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010082_0042_0F7C94BFF7F81060"/>
ſubordination, and movements. Theſe, however intricate they may appear, all concur to eſtabliſh the moſt perfect harmony in the human frame, which the attentive inquirer finds from Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, to be created with the moſt geometrical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, according to laws preſcribed by unerring wiſdom.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, Anatomy is to be eſteemed one of the principal pillars, on which we are to raiſe the ſupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of medical ſcience, as well phyſic as ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. Thoſe who would engage in either cannot apply themſelves too early, or with too much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in order to become ſkillful anatomiſts.</p>
            <p>CAN any one pretend to ſtile himſelf a <hi>Surgeon,</hi> or to perform any operation with ſafety, if he knows not the ſtructure of the part he is to operate upon? If he is ignorant of the muſcles which give it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of the nerves which give it ſenſation, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting through the tendon of a muſcle, or by dividing ſome principal nerve, he may forever deprive the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of life, or movement in the part. If he knows not the courſe and diſtribution of its veſſels, he may wound ſome conſiderable artery, and from the loſs of blood may occaſion dangerous accidents. Perhaps ſpeedy death will be the conſequence of his raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010082_0043_0F7C94C29C3D4368"/>WITH what propriety can any one arrogate to himſelf the title of <hi>Phyſician,</hi> if he is ignorant of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy? how ſhall he be able to diſcover the ſeat of a diſeaſe, or what chance has he of being in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to remedy it? Nor is a ſuperficial acquaintance with Anatomy ſufficient for either Phyſician or Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon. The latter, (that he may not miſtake what is natural for a diſeaſe, and in attempting to relieve an imaginary evil, bring on a real one;) ought to know the ſmalleſt hollow or protuberance of a bone; which ſerve in many inſtances to direct him, how far he may operate with ſafety, as the ſituation of the nerves and blood veſſels are often to be referred to them. It is requiſite for a phyſician to ſearch out every the leaſt particular in the ſtructure of all the internal parts, that he maybe in a condition to diſtinguiſh the nature of the diſorder with which it is affected. As a ſkillful Pilot informs himſelf of the leaſt bank of ſand or ſhoal where he is to avoid navigating his ſhip; ſo every follower of medical purſuits ſhould be intelligent in the minutiae of Anatomy, if he wiſhes to practice with eaſe to himſelf, and to the benefit of his patient.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Materia Medica and Botany may very properly be termed the natural hiſtory of medicine,</hi> as from theſe branches of ſcience we derive our knowledge of that part of natural hiſtory, which more immediately
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010082_0044_0F7C94C310069D88"/>
relates to the health giving arts. How worthy of a Phyſician, a Philoſopher or a Gentleman, is the knowledge of the different productions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taken in its full extent? I cannot too earneſtly recommend this ſtudy to young men, to qualify them for every uſeful profeſſion that is converſant about natural objects, and eſpecially for the ſtudy of medicine. But it behoves me to ſpeak more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of medical natural hiſtory, if I may be allowed to adopt that term in the ſenſe I have already uſed it; and firſt of Materia Mediea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MATERIA MEDICA treats of the natural hiſtory, and medical virtues, of all thoſe bodies which are employed in diet, or in medicine.</hi> It conſiders the changes they undergo when applied to the human body, either internally or externally; and the effects they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce on the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>IT is beyond contradiction an object of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, to both Phyſician and Surgeon, to be well acquainted with the Materia Medica, as it belongs to this to conſider the nature of aliments, the choice of medicines, and a knowledge of their action in the veſſels, and how they preſerve or reſtore health.</p>
            <p>PHYSIOLOGY, Pathology, Chymiſtry, the Materia Medica, and indeed the ſeveral branches of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine lend a mutual aid to one another, in a greater or leſs degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:010082_0045_0F7C94C3CAA2ABE8"/>
               <hi>BOTANY is a knowlege of the natural hiſtory of vegetables.</hi> It may therefore be conſidered as part of the Materia Medica, as far at leaſt, as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the knowledge of medicine.</p>
            <p>BY the Science of Botany we learn to methodize the vegetable part of the creation, and to range ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables in different claſſes, ſubdividing them into a variety of orders, genera, and ſpecies. Such a ſyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic, or botanic arrangement, as it is called, has taught us this general obſervation, that all plants of the ſame natural order have in a degree ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon virtue. Botany thus leſſens the difficulties we muſt otherwiſe have been at in diſcovering their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical virtues. I need not therefore dwell on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this ſtudy to a Phyſician and a Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>CHYMISTRY</hi> is either Philoſophic, or Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceutic. The former conſiders the particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of bodies, and explains their effects. It is diſtinguiſhed from natural philoſophy, as this latter is only converſant about the general properties of bodies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PHARMACEUTIC CHYMISTRY, is that branch of philoſphic Chymiſtry, which regards the particular properties of ſuch bodies as are appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to medicine.</hi> It conſiders their virtues in a ſimple ſtate, or thoſe which they acquire by combination,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010082_0046_0F7C94C475771A70"/>
and in this has a cloſe connection with the Materia Medica.</p>
            <p>THERE are indeed but few ſubſtances which are uſed as Medicines, ſimply and ſingly, in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate; but they are commonly compounded by art. As it belongs to Pharmaceutic Chymiſtry to treat of the ſeparation of the parts of medicinal ſubſtances from one another, and of the new properties ariſing from the compoſition or reſolution of thoſe bodies, it is manifeſt that this ſcience is of eſſential uſe. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſkill we may boaſt in inveſtigating the nature of a diſeaſe, or in underſtanding the ſtructure of the body, yet without a knowledge of the inſtruments which are to be uſed, and of their properties and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the body, whereby they produce a change from ſickneſs to health, other knowledge avails little in the cure of diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE THEORY of PHYSIC,</hi> more commonly termed Medical Inſtitutions, comprehends under it, the important doctrines of Phyſiology and Pathology.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>PHYSIOLOGY</hi> teaches the uſes of the ſeveral parts in the human body, it treats of all the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vital, animal, and natural, in a ſound ſtate. The illuſtrious <hi>Haller</hi> very properly denominates it <hi>anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Anatomy.</hi>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:010082_0047_0F7C94C5421DABF8"/>IT is the application of natural philoſophy to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, and may very well be defined <hi>A philoſophic knowledge of the human body, or a ſcience of all the conditions ariſing from the ſtructure of its parts.</hi> It has a foundation both in Anatomy and Philoſophy.—Anatomy, in a more limited view, conſiders the ſtructure of the dead body only; but Phyſiology teaches the functions of the living body. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction will be more eaſily apprehended from obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a perſon may be a good practical Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and yet be ignorant of Phyfſology; but it is impoſſible to be a good Phyſiologiſt, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an able Anatomiſt.</p>
            <p>THE great ſtock of literature, as well as genius, which is requiſite to become an adept in this ſcience, and the important nature of the ſubject it treats of, point out its dignity and excellency.</p>
            <p>AS every diſeaſe we labour under is a diſorder of the vital, animal, or natural functions; a thorough acquaintance with theſe in their ſound ſtate is implied before we can pretend to underſtand their morbid affections, or how to remedy them.</p>
            <p>PHYSIOLOGY gives us the cleareſt light in the cure of diſeaſes, which is the grand object of all our inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in medicine. The ſtudy of it is moſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and engages our cloſeſt attention from the many curious ſubjects with which it abounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010082_0048_0F7C94C6155019B8"/>
               <hi>PATHOLOGY treats of the vital, animal, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral functions in a morbid ſtate, as Phyſiology does in a ſound healthful condition.</hi> It traces out the ſeat of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, examines their cauſes and effects, ſhews their differences, explains their ſymptoms, and all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent phoenomena, which reſult from various affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſyſtem, it prognoſticates the event, and indicates the general method of treatment. In ſhort, it forms a ſyſtem of precepts in the art of healing. It is the immediate guide to practice, and a very capital part of medical knowledge.</p>
            <p>THE ſmalleſt reflection is ſufficient to diſcover the intimate connection of Phyſiolgy and Pathology, and the ſubſerviency of the former to the latter.</p>
            <p>LET no man lay claim to the dignified title of <hi>Phyſician,</hi> who is not thoroughly converſant in the medical inſtitutions. Without this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we have no better right to take upon us the cure of diſeaſes, than <hi>a blind man to judge of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or a deaf man of ſounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE PRAXIS, or PRACTICE OF MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINE, is immediately converſant about diſeaſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and treats in the moſt particular manner of their nature, ſpecific difference, their cauſes and ſymptoms, and eſpecially the method of curing them, or alleviating the ſeverity of them when incurable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:010082_0049_0F7C94C82C4B6E88"/>THIS part therefore, as it teaches us the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal application of the precepts derived from a juſt reaſoning and accurate obſervations made upon diſeaſes, is unqueſtionably to be accounted the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing part of Medicine.</p>
            <p>As the end of our purſuits is more noble than the means, the importance and dignity of practice are therefore evident; and in as far as the knowledge of the other branches are not conſidered in ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viency to this, they are merely ſpeculative; though they muſt be allowed to afford a ſpeculation of a very ſublime nature.</p>
            <p>MEDICAL Science is one whole, of which all the branches I have enumerated are the ſeveral parts. They may be conſidered as the links of a chain that have a mutual connection with one another. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, Materia Medica, Botany, Chymiſtry, and the Inſtitutions, are only the ladder by which we are to mount up to practice, A general knowledge, at leaſt, in each one of them, is uſeful to both Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Surgeon; particularly to the former, who in proportion as he is more intimately acquainted with them all, will become more ſkillful in the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcience. For, although he confines himſelf to his proper province of preſcribing for diſeaſes, yet ought he to underſtand the principles of the entire art, and more eſpecially he ought to be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010082_0050_0F7C94C906BADAC8"/>
in practice. Seeing the life and health of mankind is the object of medicine, ignorance of the practice is a grand defect in a Phyſician, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable crime, as attended with irreparable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</p>
            <p>THE great extent of medical ſcience, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends under it ſo many different branches, makes it impoſſible to learn it thoroughly without we fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llow a certain order. Whilſt we neglect this, all our ideas are but crude conceptions, a rope of ſand, without any firm connection. Should the ſtudent, as chance or whim might direct, ſometimes apply himſelf to one branch, ſometimes to another; or read indiſcriminately even the beſt authors on the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent parts of Medicine; for want of method, all his knowledge would be ſuperficial; though he might take as much pains as would ſuffice to make him eminently ſkillful, had he from the beginning pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a well concerted plan. What progreſs could we make in Mathematics, if we did not proceed ſtep by ſtep, and in a certain order?</p>
            <p>THE knowledge of the more intricate and hidden truths of ſcience are to be developed by degrees. We can only arrive at them by the aſſiſtance of other more obvious truths, which they are connected with, and which lead us to them by a certain chain of facts, obſervations, and juſt deductions in a train
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010082_0051_0F7C94CA0E5F2748"/>
of ſtrict reaſoning. Medical truths riſe out of one another, in ſome meaſure, like the propoſitions of Euclid. If we did not underſtand the demonſtration of the firſt, we ſhould not be able to percieve the proof of the more intricate ones that follow, which can only be explained by means of them, as a certainty of the latter depends upon the evidence of the former. What would require years of ſtudy to gain a ſupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial acquaintance with, if we followed no juſt plan, may be attained within as few months, by purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a regular ſyſtem; ſo much does method con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to facilitate our progreſs.</p>
            <p>THE order which I would recommend in the ſtudy of Medicine is to begin with Anatomy; then what I have called medical natural Hiſtory, viz. The Materia Medica and Botany; Chymiſtry ſhould follow; the Inſtitutes come next; and the Study of Practice ſhould compleat the work.</p>
            <p>THUS I have ſketched out a general plan of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying Medicine, which it will be of the higheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequence for ſtudents to obſerve. It belongs to the teachers of the ſeveral branches, to give more minute directions with regard to the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of each reſpective one. It will not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per however to obſerve here, that young men ought to come well prepared for the ſtudy of Medicine by having their minds enriched with all the aid
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010082_0052_0F7C94CA74DEF538"/>
they can receive from the languages, and the liberal arts. Latin and Greek are very neceſſary to be known by a Phyſician. The latter contains the rich original treaſures of ancient medical ſcience, and of the firſt parents of the healing arts. The former contains all the wealth of more modern lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. It is the vehicle of knowledge in which the learned men of every nation in Europe chooſe to convey their ſentiments, and communicate their diſcoveries to the world. As it is the beſt known of the dead languages, it is choſen as the moſt proper one, by the various nations of Europe, for a medium of intercourſe amongſt the learned, that is equally attainable by every one of them Hence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes indiſpenſably neceſſary for a Phyſician, who is to derive his knowledge from ſo many different ſources, to be well acquainted with Latin.</p>
            <p>THE French language has prevailed much in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. The advantages which we may reap from the writings of many eminent men, and of many learned ſocieties, which are publiſhed in French, make the knowledge of this language very valuable alſo to a Phyſician.</p>
            <p>AN acquaintance with Mathematics and natural Philoſophy we cannot diſpenſe with, ſince we can go but ſmall lengths in natural or medical inquiries without their aſſiſtance. Happy are we to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010082_0053_0F7C94CB357BC9A8"/>
have all theſe taught in ſuch perfection in this place. Deſtitute of that general knowledge which unveils to us the operations of nature, we cannot penetrate into thoſe truths, that form the rules by which we ought to conduct ourſelves, in the cure of diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>THERE is no art yet known which may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomewhat to the improvement of Medicine; nor is there any one which requires more aſſiſtance than that of Phyſic from every other ſcience. Let young men therefore, who would engage in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Medicine or Surgery, make uſe of all their induſtry, to poſſeſs themſelves in good time of theſe acquiſitions. They are neceſſary to facilitate a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the healing arts; they embelliſh the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and give many peculiar advantages, unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable without them.</p>
            <p>So much being ſaid of the nature of medical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we are the better prepared to form a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the ſubject propoſed. Let us now take a general view of the ſtate of Phyſic as hitherto prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in America.</p>
            <p>AND here we may congratulate ourſelves, that in this, and ſome of the large neighbouring towns, we have a number of ſkillful phyſicians and expert ſurgeons, qualified by genius, education, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, to take charge of the health of their fellow
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010082_0054_0F7C94CBF46EB6D8"/>
creatures. Under theſe it is the cuſtom of medical ſtudents to enter as apprentices, in order to learn their practice, and get an acquaintance with their profeſſion. This it muſt be allowed is a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; but if we add to it, a caſual converſation ſometimes with the moſt able maſters whom they can have acceſs to conſult, an intercourſe with one another, and a reciprocal communication of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and obſervation, together with reading what authors they can procure on the various ſubjects of which this ſcience treats; theſe make the ſum total of the beſt medical education in America. How lame and inſufficient it is muſt appear to all who have the leaſt intelligence in theſe matters; but will be ſeen more evidently, I imagine, as we examine it more nearly.</p>
            <p>IF, as I before obſerved, it is neceſſary that a plan be marked out for directing Students, and that they ſhould be taught a regular courſe of every diſtinct branch of Medicine; the infant ſtate of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and the want of profeſſed teachers, have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto cloged medical purſuits in America with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable obſtacles.</p>
            <p>NEVER yet has there offered a coalition of able men, who would undertake to give compleat and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular courſes of Lectures on the different branches of Medicine; and ſuch an extenſive field it is, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the united efforts of ſeveral co-operating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010082_0055_0F7C94CE68E740A0"/>
to cultivate it with ſucceſs. As well might a parent take upon himſelf the private tuition of his ſon, and to make him maſter of all the different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, arts, and ſciences, which are generally deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed requiſite, previous to his entering upon the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtudies of Law, Phyſic and Divinity; as that a Phyſician, engaged in an extenſive practice, ſhould undertake to deliver to his apprentices, in a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner, the precepts of his art in all its branches. This is as impracticable as it is unreaſonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. In ſpite of himſelf and his inclination to qualify young men in the profeſſion, they muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be left, for the moſt part, more to their own ingenuity, and precarious application, than a good man could wiſh. Theſe are difficulties which he would rejoice to have removed; but they are evils which have hitherto been without a remedy. The fatigue, the greatneſs of expence, and the want of leiſure time, which phyſicians involved in buſineſs cannot command, are bars, which thoſe moſt willing to perfect ſtudents cannot get over.</p>
            <p>YOUNG men, who are limited to the preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of improvement in America, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the ſtage of action, but with unfavourable proſpect, and they muſt unavoidably be in continual perplexities. For ſeldom can we hope to ſee thoſe who from too great forwardneſs, or too narrow cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, engage untimely in the practice of their profeſſion, ever become more than ſervile imitators
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010082_0056_0F7C94CF5F3FE890"/>
of others. They blindly purſue an uncertain tract, in which they muſt conſtantly wander, ſince it is ſo often obſcured, and inſufficient to conduct them any great length.</p>
            <p>A contracted view of Medicine naturally confines a man to a very narrow circle, and limits him to a few partial indications in the cure of diſeaſes. He ſoon gets through his little ſtock of knowledge; he repeats over and over his round of preſcriptions, the ſame almoſt in every caſe; and, although he is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually embarraſſed, has the vanity to believe that, from the few maxims which he has adopted, he has within himſelf all the principles of medical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that he has exhauſted all the reſources of art. This is a notion ſubverſive of all improvement. It flatters the imagination of the indolent, as it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes with thoſe toilſome labours which are neceſſary to the production of truth; and chains him down to a dangerous rotine of practice, unworthy the name of art.</p>
            <p>THE induſtry of many centuries have already been employed to bring Phyſic to that degree of perfection at which it is now arrived. It will ſtill require a long time to remove the obſcurities which yet veil many parts of it. The application of many, amongſt the greateſt of men, has hitherto been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſufficient to clear up all our doubts in medicine. How then can it be ſuppoſed that any one, untutor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this art, can by his own natural abilities ever
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010082_0057_0F7C94CFD5E67200"/>
reach the bounds of what is already known in it? The great multiplicity of diſeaſes, which beſet the human race, preſent us with a field too vaſt and unknown for individuals to cultivate by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Their cauſes are frequently ſo latent, and the uſual reſources of art ſo often fail the moſt ſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as to compel them to ſeek out new paths in which they may proceed.</p>
            <p>FOR a man of the moſt finiſhed genius to enter upon practice, having only that ſtock of knowledge with which his own obſervation and experience could ſupply him, unenlightened by thoſe diſcoveries which others have made, would be an act of preſumption. Had this been ſufficient to conduct us to the ſummit of our art, it would have been in a ſtate of perfection many ages ago.</p>
            <p>OBSERVATION and phyſical experiments ſhould blend their light to diſſipate obſcurity from medicine. This is the more needful, as nature commonly offers herſelf to our notice under a cloud, and requires that we ſhould follow her ſteps with ſcrupulous atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, watch all her motions, and trace her through every meander ſhe makes, in order to diſcern clearly the tract ſhe keeps in.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Preface to the memoirs of the royal Academy of Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at Paris.</note>
               <q>In a courſe of obſervation, the mind is but a mere ſpectator, and only ſees external appearances. We muſt aid theſe with the light of Philoſophy to unveil knowledge fully. We muſt dive into the bottom of things by repeated
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010082_0058_0F7C94D094733AC0"/>
and different experiments, and, as is were, force nature to yield herſelf up to our inquiries.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To accompliſh this demands the brighteſt talents, a liberal education and great experience. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe then that a Student of ordinary parts can, by any means of himſelf, acquire ſufficient ſkill in medicine to take charge properly of the lives oi mankind.</p>
            <p>THE almoſt infinite number of objects, to which he ought to be no ſtranger, paſs before him ſo very ſlowly, that the longeſt life would offer to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation but a very inconſiderable ſhare of thoſe, with which he may be made acquainted, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral branches of his profeſſion, by the inſtruction of able maſters. Shall a novice then hope, merely by his own abilities, to raiſe a ſuperſtructure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to that already built up to his hands, which has exhauſted the ingenuity and invention, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the induſtry of ſome thouſand years? Where will the moſt extenſive practice be ſufficient; and how comparitively little will the moſt enlarged fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties contribute, to furniſh him with a ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth part of the materials?</p>
            <p>SHOULD we for a moment turn our eyes upon the man, who dares to enter upon the practice of Phyſic, without being properly initiated in the ſcience, or inſtrucled in the important duties of the profeſſion, he would ſoon preſent us with a melancholy proſpect. If not paſt all feelings of humanity, what compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conſcience, what remorſe would not fill hit

breaſt from practiſing at random and in the dark, not knowing whether his preſcription might prove a wholeſome remedy, or a deſtructive poiſon. To diſcover the nature of an uncommon diſeaſe, or to account for an unuſual ſymptom, puzzles his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.—Ignorant of every true principle, from which, by a juſt reaſoning, he might be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce practical interrences, he knows not what prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtic to make, or what plan of treatment to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.—Unſteady and irreſolute, he attempts a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of means; ſuch as either avail not, or ſuch as heighten the danger of the diſeaſe, already too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.—He may thus interrupt the ſalutary attempts of nature, or, not knowing how to ſecond them, tamper with the life of his patient, and idly waiting to ſee what nature herſelf is capable of doing, neglect to ſuccour her, till it is too late, and the fatal hand of death is juſt cloſing the gloomy ſcene.—Wretched is the caſe of thoſe whom chance, or miſinformed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall throw into 1 is hands, to fall victims of his temerity.—Great is the havock which his ignorance ſpreads on every ſide, robbing the affectionate huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of his darling ſpouſe, or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wife a helpleſs widow;—increaſing the number of orphans;—mercileſsly depriving them of their parent's ſupport;—bereaving the afflicted parents of their only comfort and hope, by the untimely death of their beloved infants, and laying whole families defolate. Remorſeleſs foe to mankind! actuated by more than ſavage cruelty! hold, hold thy extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating hand.—</p>

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:010082_0060_0F7C94D20A0E9D90"/>GLAD ſhould I be to moderate this too exact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the effects of ignorant and preſumptuous practice; but what judgment can we paſs on thoſe, who have been ſcarcely inſtructed in the firſt elements of medical ſcience, and yet force themſelves into prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, as if they meant to ſport themſelves with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life, and human calamities?</p>
            <p>A VERY judicious perſon <note n="‡" place="bottom">Monſ. Süe, profeſſor of Anatomy.</note> has remarked, that Medicine is the ſcience concerning which people in common take upon them to reaſon moſt, without having the leaſt notion.—Who, that has not made Mathematics his ſtudy, will preſume to argue upon any of the difficult calculations of Algebra? But when medical ſubjects are the topic, doubtleſs we are maſters of them without ſtudy. It muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed indeed, if we know much about medicine without being educated in it, that our ideas of it are truly innate.</p>
            <p>ABSTRACT truth is at all times but a ſimple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided object, yet has ten thouſand counterfeits to impoſe upon the unwary. No wonder that the impatient ardor of youth, who cannot brook delay, or always take the neceſſary time to diſtinguiſh truth from falſehood, aſpiring to reach the top of ſcience by a rapid flight, hurries them on in a too unguarded manner, when left to themſelves, and thus
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010082_0061_0F7C94D2C38978C8"/>
precipitates them into the groſſeſt errors. In me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, as in other ſciences, if they do not let out on ſound principles, they paſs on from error to error and multiply miſtakes, unable to diveſt themſelves of their firſt prejudices, which, being confirmed by habit, become a ſecond nature.</p>
            <p>Eaſy it is to fall into errors, hard to recover our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Facilis deſcenſus Averni; ſed revocare gradum, hoc opus, hic labor eſt.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>WITH greater caſe we may ſow juſt principles in the beginning, than clear away the rank weeds of popular prejudices, after having had time to take deep root, and fix themſelves firmly in the minds of ſtudents.</p>
            <p>LET us now turn our views to the growing ſtate of this and the neighbouring colonies; let us reflect on the great number of inhabitants ſcattered through ſuch an extenſive tract of country, who are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all the aids of medical ſcience. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider further, that in many large towns and villages, there are a number of perſons entruſted with the practice of medicine and ſurgery, who, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of all means of acquiring the true principles of their profeſſion, remain in a pitiful ſtate of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in it, without any proſpect or opportunity of correcting their errors, or greatly improving their
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010082_0062_0F7C94D5C3E1BA88"/>
knowledge. We cannot then remain untouched with ſentiments of compaſſion; we cannot avoid feeling part of their diſtreſs, or forbear to wiſh that a remedy were found for ſo great a misfortune.</p>
            <p>NOR is this ſo deſirable an object quite beyond our reach. The inſtitution of ſchools for teaching the ſeveral branches of the healing arts muſ have a very great tendency to effect our wiſhes. To the full accompliſhment of theſe nothing can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute more powerfully, than the reſolution the truſtees of this ſeminary have taken, to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance this ſcheme which I have had the honour of propoſing; and their encouragement of ſuch perſons as, upon due information, they ſhall find qualified to take upon them the important offices of profeſſors, in the various branches of Medicine.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH we may not be in a condition to enter upon every part of this great undertaking immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, yet we may lay a foundation, which cannot fail of being built upon ſhortly by thoſe who follow us. Time will perfect what is properly begun. What indeed is all ſcience, but the accumulated ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and diſcoveries of a ſucceſſion of many people, framed into a ſyſtem? When this is once accompliſhed, every individual may then avail himſelf of the labours of others, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010082_0063_0F7C94D699E092A0"/>
thus arrive, in a compendious manner, at a competent knowledge of any art. This is happy for us, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life is ſhort, and the human mind neceſſarily oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with a great number of purſuits, very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from our particular profeſſions, which would not allow us otherwiſe to go any great lengths.</p>
            <p>FROM the union of ingenious men the arts find reſources, never to be met with in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of individuals, with whom the moſt uſeful truths are frequently buried; whilſt ſocieties form a kind of magazine, which collects together all the knowledge of the learned, and conſecrates it to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic utility. It eſtabliſhes a commerce for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, which never periſhes, but from age to age is a fruitful ſource of new acquifitions. <note n="†" place="bottom">Preface to memoirs of Royal Acad. of Surgery.</note> What ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid progreſs have we not ſometimes ſeen in ſcience from a conſpiration of counſel and induſtry? Thus inſtitutions, which have appeared inconſiderable at firſt, improve faſt, and make haſty ſtrides towards importance and grandure. This very Seminary, of late only a collection of private ſchools, although of ſo ſhort a ſtanding, has increaſed its reputation and uſefulneſs, ſo far as to attract the notice of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country; and already begins to flouriſh, beyond what could reaſonably be expected in ſo ſhort a time.</p>
            <p>OF what conſequence the united efforts of men learned in their profeſſion are, the medical college
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010082_0064_0F7C94D737245158"/>
of Edinburgh afford a remarkable inſtance. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of little more than forty years, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent profeſſorſhips in Medicine were firſt formed. A few gentlemen from Scotland, then proſecuting their medical ſtudies at Leyden, concerted a plan, and undertook, themſelves, the important charge of inſtituting ſchools for teaching the various branches of Medicine. They met with countenance and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from the patrons of the univerſity, and by the great abilities, aſſiduity, and experience of thoſe gentlemen, and ſome few of their ſucceſſors, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of that place is raiſed to ſuch a height, that, to their immortal honour, it already rivals, if not ſurpaſſes that of every other ſchool of Phyſic in Europe. The names of Drummond, Dick, Clerk, Rutherford, Sinclair, Alſton, Plummer, Monroe, Whytt, Cullen, Hope, Black, and ſome others, are now known wherever the knowledge of Phyſic is cultivated; and they are revered at home as parents and guardians of the healing arts. There is a great reſort of medical ſtudents at the univerſity of Edinburgh, as well from Great-Britain, Ireland, and the Weſt-Indies, as from the Continents of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope and America. Theſe bring to the univerſity and city conſiderable advantages, and, in return, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the fame of their learning and their profeſſors to every quarter of the globe. Were it neceſſary I could eaſily enumerate many ſimiliar inſtances of the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010082_0065_0F7C94D84BBBE800"/>
improvement of ſcience; but theſe, I imagine, will ſuffice for the preſent.</p>
            <p>WHY ſhould we be deterred from eſtabliſhing like inſtitutions of Medicine in this ſeminary, eſpecially as ſo many circumſtances conſpire to invite and encourage ſo important an undertaking. I ſhall briefly enumerate the moſt intereſting of them.</p>
            <p>THE city of Philadelphia, adorned with a ſet of eminent practitioners, draws to it a great number of pupils, from the neighbouring parts, to learn the arts of Phyſic and Surgery. We may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect, that from the propoſed inſtitution, the number of ſtudents, who ſhali reſort hither to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of theſe advantages, will be gradually aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</p>
            <p>BESIDES men of great abilities and eminence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom they may ſee private practice, the hoſpital of this city is a great perſuaſive to determine a concourſe of medical ſtudents to this place. It would be doubly uſeful to them, and increaſe their motive of repairing here, if they could be firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly initiated in the principles of their profeſſion, by regular courſes of lectures duly delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:010082_0066_0F7C94D8B84D2D70"/>THIS noble charity, maintained by the donations of the benevolent at no ſmall expence, ſupports a great number of ſick of both ſexes. As there are ſix phyſicians of the moſt unqueſtionable ſkill, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and character, who, moved by the tender principles of humanity, have taken upon them the charge of attending the ſick gratuitouſly; pupils here meet with ſuch a number of caſes, both chronic and acute, treated ſo judiciouſly, and ſo agreeable to the rules of art, as cannot fail very much to facilitate the knowledge of their profeſſion.</p>
            <p>IT is a moſt favourable circumſtance to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking which I have ſuggeſted, that of theſe ſix phyſicians, no leſs than five of them are truſtees of this college. We may from hence, I think, ſafely infer, that every thing in their power may be hoped for, to ſecond the medical inſtitutions of the college, by uniting with them the advantages of the hoſpital, and thus rendering the education of youth in the healing arts as compleat as poſſible in this city; to which nothing can contribute more than a courſe of clinical practice and clinical lectures, by phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of knowledge and experience.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Beſides thoſe who are apprentices to, or under the immediate tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of the hoſpital phyſicians, every ſtudent of Medicine in town is admitted to ſee their common practice in the hoſpital, upon pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain ſum annually during his attendance there. It were to be wiſhed that ſome of thoſe gentlemen, ſo ſkillful and experienced in the healing arts, enriched with uſeful obſervations, which only time, and an extenſive practice can furniſh, would undertake to give a courſe of clinical lectures, in order to explain the hoſpital practice; the ſtudents paying ſuch reaſonable fees to thoſe clinical teachers as may be thought adequate to their trouble. This is a ſtep of the greateſt and moſt obvious utility to both hoſpital and ſtudent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to reaſon and the uſage of ſome of the beſt hoſpitals in Europe.</p>
                  <p>From my perſonal acquaintance with many of the managers when I attended the hoſpital ſome years ago, I am perſuaded they would readily encourage this plan. Their known benevolence and ardent deſire of contributing all in their power towards the improvement of medical arts, as well as relief of the ſick; and thus uniting two of the moſt valuable purpoſes of ſuch a foundation, lead me to think ſo.</p>
                  <p>When two ſuch important inſtitutions, as a medical college and a well regulated hoſpital, contribute mutually to the advantage of each other, all ranks and conditions of people would no doubt moſt chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully unite in ſupport of a common intereſt, ſo beneficial to uſeful li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, and ſo advantageous to the province in general.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:010082_0067_0F7C93C0F4ACF470"/>THE flouriſhing ſtate of literature in this college, and the perfection in which the languages, mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and polite arts are taught here, are ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements for ſuch young men as propoſe engaging in the ſtudy of Medicine, to enter the college. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when medical lectures are given under the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of the truſtees and faculty, at the ſame time that ſtudents are proſecuting other parts of learning, they will have greater advantages there than hitherto they have enjoyed. Thus the motives of repairing to Philadelphia for the ſtudy of Medicine and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will multiply in proportion.</p>
            <p>THIS city, ſo large, in ſuch a thriving ſtate, and ſo extremely beautiful and pleaſant in its ſituation, as well as ſo nearly central to all the colonies on the continent, has peculiar advantages in reſpect to the reſort of ſtudents; which added to the advantage of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010082_0068_0F7C94D9799EBB80"/>
the college, hoſpital, and the different courſes of lectures, could not fail of bringing a concourſe of ſtrangers to this place.</p>
            <p>THE eſtabliſhment of a medical library in this col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege would prove another great benefit to ſtudents, and tend likewiſe to influence their reſort hither. Proper means may poſſibly be ſuggeſted to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh this, without any great additional charge to the college. The pupils that attend lectures, for whoſe advantage it is intend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, may, upon being matricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, afford each of them to contribute annually a ſmall ſum. This from a number of pupils, in a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ſome years, would be of conſiderable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice towards procuring a medical library. Perhaps the phyſicians of Philadelphia, touched with generous ſentiments of regard for the riſing generation, and the manifeſt advantages accruing to the college thereby, would ſpare ſome uſeful books, or contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what as a foundation on which we might begin.</p>
            <p>THE growth of this and the neighbouring colonies calls aloud for a medical inſtitution. The increaſing number of inhabitants demands an increaſe of thoſe who exerciſe the profeſſion of Medicine and Surgery, and ought to be an argument with all of us, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard either the preſent or future advantages of the country, to attend ſeriouſly to the importance of the ſubject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:010082_0069_0F7C94DA3879C768"/>THE ſcheme of eſtabliſhing medical lectures, which I now ſubject with all deference to your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, has been communicated to ſome very competent and unbiaſſed judges in England, who not only deem it practicable, but a laudable and uſeful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. The great and well known Dr. Fothergill, the juſtly celebrated Dr. Hunter, and the learned Dr. Watſon, men diſtinguiſhed for their ſuperior know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in literature, and particularly eminent in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing which relates to medical ſcience, have eſteemed the improvement of ſuch knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us worthy of notice, and the inſtitution of lectures in every branch of Medicine as deſerving the patronage of all who wiſh well to arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. It would therefore argue great inattention in us to neglect the firſt opportunity that offers, of giving effect and ſtability to the deſign. Nor can we defer the execution of it at this time, without riſquing the loſs of the noble proſpect which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, not eaſily to be retrieved.</p>
            <p>IT is with the higheſt ſatisfaction I am informed from Dr. Shippen, junior, that in an addreſs to the public as introductory to his firſt anatomical courſe, he propoſed ſome hints of a plan for giving medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal lectures amongſt us. But I do not learn that he recommended at all a collegiate undertaking of this kind. What led me to it was the obvious
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010082_0070_0F7C94DBB45794F8"/>
utility that would attend it, and the deſire I had of preſenting, as a tribute of gratitude to my al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma mater, a full and enlarged plan for the inſtitution of Medicine, in all its branches, in this ſeminary where I had part of my education, being amongſt the firſt ſons who ſhared in its public honours. I was further induced to it from a conſideration, that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſchemes of propagating knowledge are inſtable in their nature," and that the cultivation of uſeful learning can only be effectually promoted under thoſe who are patrons of ſcience, and under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and direction of men incorporated for the improvement of literature.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the truſtees of the college think proper to found a profeſſorſhip in Anatomy, Dr. Shippen having been concerned already in teaching that branch of medical ſcience is a circumſtance favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our wiſhes. Few here can be ignorant of the great opportunities he has had abroad of qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in Anatomy, and that he has already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven three courſes thereof in this city, and deſigns to enter upon a fourth courſe next Winter.</p>
            <p>I PROPOSE in a few months to employ myſelf in giving a courſe of lectures on the Materia Medica, in which the pharmaceutic treatment of medicines, as well as their virtues, will be deſcribed, and the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010082_0071_0F7C94DC744A42D0"/>
doctrines of the chymical properties of bodies will be conſidered, as far as it uſeful to give a general idea of Chymiſtry, and as is conſiſtent with a courſe of the Materia Medica. Next year I deſign to attempt a courſe of lectures upon the Inſtitutes or Theory of Medicine, which will be illuſtrated with practical obſervations. Poſſibly in a few years more, perſons duly qualified may offer to undertake full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat courſes of every branch of medicine; and a plan may be adopted, conformable to that which is followed in the, ſo juſtly celebrated, ſchool of phyſic at Edinburgh.</p>
            <p>THE regular diſtribution of literary honours upon the deſerving is a ſtep, which is neglected in no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution that promiſes fair to be extenſively uſeful. As it is ſometimes prejudicial to attempt a ſcheme entirely out of our reach, ſo, on the other hand, a too contracted plan often mars the work altogether, or fruſtrates the great utility which might be derived from a more finiſhed model. Let us aim then to diſtinguiſh worth with adequate rewards, and confer due honours on real merit. This will, render the inſtitution compleat, and give all poſſible encouragement to pupils.</p>
            <p>As you have hitherto been ſo careful not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the honours of this ſeminary on any occaſion
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010082_0072_0F7C94DEE9631F90"/>
by conferring them on the undeſerving; and have made degrees in arts not an unmeaning title, but an honourable badge of diſtinction, you have given ſolid reputation to thoſe who have been educated here. You have thus conducted them with ecclat to the ſtudy of the learned profeſſions, or uſhered them into other uſeful ſpheres of life with luſtre and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The ſame regard being had to the higher degrees of literature would increaſe theſe good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. In a ſhort time, every perſon would be aſhamed to think of pracriſing phyſic, who had not induſtr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly cultivated the beſt opportunities of inſtruction. He would otherwiſe be marked out by every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent man, as one who had never been properly initiated in his profeſſion, and, conſequently, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to the taſk which he had preſumptuouſly engaged in.</p>
            <p>IF the ſeveral parts of the deſign, which I have pointed out as practicable to execute, meet with that attention which they ſeem to merit, it is not to be doubted that, in a ſhort time, medicine will put on the form of a regular ſcience, and be ſucceſsfully cultivated in the College. And ſuppoſing we are not able to meet with gentlemen already in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to engage in every part of the work, we may however hope that a laudable ambition, ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of honour, and the intereſt of the public weal will prompt ſome of the riſing ſtudents, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010082_0073_0F7C94DFDA5C4E68"/>
ourſelves, of more than ordinary talents; to cultivate with the utmoſt application the particular branches of medicine, to which they find their genius more eſpecially point. It is to be hoped that they will avail themſelves of every opportunity of improvement by going abroad, and on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, tranſplant hither, to the great emolument of the community, every different branch of knowledge relative to their profeſſion. Is it not probable that ſuch a plan as this laid before them will open the views, ſpur on the ambition, and allure the induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of ſtudents, ſo that we may hope to ſee, in ſome years, a number of gentlemen, natives of America., qualified to fill the moſt difficult and important parts of their profeſſion, with uſefulnefs and applauſe?</p>
            <p>IT may perhaps be objected, that the colonies are yet in ſo infant a ſtate that any attempt to eſtabliſh medical ſchools is premature. It may be imagined, that it will prevent many from going abroad, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a more compleat education. Let it be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that every one, whoſe circumſtances allow of this, will have a plan before them, and every incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to render their education as perfect as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, Many who are not in a condition to ſupport the expence of being educated abroad, by being inſtructed here in the firſt elements of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and informed what further remains to be done, have it in their power to finiſh their ſtudies abroad
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010082_0074_0F7C94E042741CE0"/>
afterwards with advantage. This claſs perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the greateſt part of medical ſtudents.</p>
            <p>THE ſaving of money may be thought more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary at this juncture, when the check which our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce has received makes it ſo ſcarce amongſt us.</p>
            <p>SOME there are indeed, and not a few, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any means afford the expence of croſſing the Atlantic, to proſecute their ſtudies abroad. The propoſed inſtitution will therefore prove highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to every claſs of ſtudents in Medicine.</p>
            <p>THERE is a difficulty indeed in the way of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of great weight, which it were to be wiſhed could be ſurmounted; I mean in caſe all the different branches of medicine ſhould be blended in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any profeſſor. This evil would call aloud for a remedy. The love of humanity prompts every ingenious man, engaged in that part of medical pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits which he likes beſt, to proſecute it with aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and conſtancy. The bounds of life are the only limits to his induſtry. He devotes himſelf entirely to a toilſome ſtudy, but which ceaſes to appear ſo to him, when the interefts of humanity are the fruits of his labours. There are men fo intent upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving favourite ſtudies, that a labour of very many years is but a conſtant exerciſe of the eyes and hands, by which the ſcience in general is greatly
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010082_0075_0F7C94E0F5FA5FE8"/>
enriched, whilſt they themſelves remain in a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful indigence and obſcurity, neglected by thoſe to whom their labours prove ſo beneficial. <note n="†" place="bottom">Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Surgery.</note>

            <p>WHILST Medicine from the greatneſs of its object, the preſervation of the ſpecies, is one of the moſt uſeful ſubjects of knowledge to a ſtate, and at the ſame time one of the moſt extenſive and difficult; we juſt regret that the very different employment of Phyſician, Surgeon, and Apothecary, ſhould be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>at his abilities. They certainly require very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent talents. The infant ſtate of a place, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed as an argument, not in ſupport, but as an apology for ſuch meaſures. The longer we follow any faulty cuſtom, the more difficult we find the taſk to break through the ſhackles of it, even when it enſlaves us to our greateſt detriment.</p>
            <p>EVERY mechanic art, and almoſt every employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in life, ſerve as inſtructive leſſons to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticioners of Medicine. The conſtruction of a watch, the building of a houſe, may the making of a pin, are ſtriking examples of the truth of this aſſertion. In each of them a number of different artiſts are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who confining themſelves every one to his own branch of buſineſs, the whole work is more quickly finiſhed, and more highly improved. The length, to which human ſkill may arrive, when thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010082_0076_0F7C94E1DBC74C30"/>
directed is amazing. Why then ſhould we continue to follow ſuch a variety of different occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations as are generally crouded together in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the healing art? The mutual intereſt of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and practitioner ſeem to require a different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure. The chief argument alledged for it, viz. that it is leſs expenſive, is altogether fallacious, and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I am much out in my conjectures, it will be found a very difficult taſk to prove the aſſertion. But granting it to be truely ſo, yet when life is the object at ſtake, a notion of cheapening health, and a diſparagement of the practitioners ſkill, argue a ſordid mind, and will, in the end, always diſcover a moſt miſtaken plan of oeconomy.</p>
            <p>IF Phyſic, Surgery, and Pharmacy were in different hands, practitioners would then enjoy much more ſatisfaction in practice. They would commonly be leſs burdened with an over hurry of buſineſs, and have an opportunity of ſtudying the caſes of the ſick at more leiſure. Would not this tend to the more ſpeedy relief of diſeaſes and the perfection of medical ſcience, as every Phyſician would have more time by ſtudy, obſervation, and experience united, to cultivate that knowledge which is the only foundation of practice? "This knowledge, ſought out by Philoſophy, drawn from nature and the operation of Medicines, and founded upon the cauſes of our complaints, upon obſervations of their ſigns and upon die laws of the animal oeconomy, form
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010082_0077_0F7C94E27A28A048"/>
the true Theory, without which, there is neither art nor method in the treatment of diſeaſes. But how great is the force of prejudice, that prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, who affect a ſeducing kind of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, ſhould look upon thoſe perſons with diſdain, who divide their application between ſtudy and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; they inſpire a contempt for Theory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they impoſe on the public who are no judges of its uſefulneſs, Thus the moſt groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance finds, in credulity, a too ſure means of decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that knowledge which can alone direct our ſteps with certainty. Ought we then to endeavour to render the art compleat, by attending only to the progreſs of that experience which is acquired by practice, which frequently begets ſo much vanity and ſeduces the vulgar?" <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Mais telle eſt la force de Prèjugès: Ces Praticiens, dis je, qui ſe parent d'une ſimplicitè sèduiſante, regardent avec dèdain ceux qui partagent leur application entre l'etude et la pratique; ils inſpirent du mepris pour la theorie, et tn impoſent au public, qui n'en çauroit connoître l'utilitè.

            <p>WHERE abilities and the love of a profeſſion unite, there is the fureſt preſage of ſucceſs. But unhappy is the Phyſician, who has a ſoul turned to philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inquiries, who loves to ſearch into the cauſes, and inveſtigate the phoenomena of diſeaſes; and yet is at the ſame time diverted from theſe uſeful reſearches, by other occupations to which he has an averſion. How diſagreeable! how cruel a caſe is it to be forced, incompliance with cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>om, to ſtifle the tender feelings of humanity; to take the knife into his unſteady hand; and in ſpite of reluctant nature within him, to be obliged to perform ſome painful and tedious operation on the ſuffering pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient! better conſigned to one whoſe inclination, experience, and addreſs, qualify him for the irkſome, but needful taſk!</p>
            <p>ON the other hand, a ſpirit of intrepidity and a particular turn of mind carry many beyond the horrors which get the better of others. Fired at the ſame time with a like love of humanity, and filled with deſires of relieving the calamities to which external violence, and innumerable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents both from within and from without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject our lot, they apply themſelves with the moſt laudable zeal and aſſiduity, to improve that eſſential

part of the healing art which is capable of giving effectual aid by the painful, but wholeſome ſeverity of manual operation.</p>
            <p>TO render any perſon dextrous in the operations of Surgery, however intrepid he may naturally be, it is neceſſary that he ſhould practiſe them often, and devote himſelf to them. This is inconſiſtent with the occupation of a Phyſician involved in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of buſineſs, and requiring leiſure to ſtudy the caſes of his patients, who linger under a complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of evils widely different.</p>
            <p>IT is to lovers of humanity like theſe, ſo different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occupied, that ſome owe the movement of their limbs, others the mitigation of obſtinate diſeaſes, and others the prolongation and pleaſure of their lives.</p>
            <p>THE buſineſs of Pharmacy is entirely different from either. Free from the cares of both, the Apothecary is to prepare and compound medicines as the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſhall direct. Altogether engaged in this, by length of time he attains to that nicety of ſkill therein, which he never could have arrived at, were his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention diſtracted by a great variety of other ſubjects.</p>
            <p>THE wiſdom of ages approved by experience, the mſtd certain teſt of knowledge, has taught us the neceſſity and utility of appointing different perſons for theſe ſo different employments, and accordingly, we find them proſecuted ſeparately in every wiſe and

Indeed the benefits which theſe preſervers of the human race, improving each his profeſſion apart, have ſhed abroad in the world, ſomewhat reſemble the great bleſſings of nature, the light and air; they are ſo common we all enjoy them, and, for the moſt part, without appearing ſenſible of their unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able value.</p>
            <p>I appeal to the common ſenſe of mankind. The common ſenſe of mankind, duly informed, gives its verdict againſt a promiſcuous profeſſion of different occupations. When a country has made ſome advances in other arts, and begins to flouriſh in knowledge, perhaps not without ſome luxury, it is high time that medical ſcience ſhould be practiſed with regularity. It would be unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the profeſſors to let it remain at a ſtand, as if they had already attained the ſummit of human wiſdom. This would curb every laudable attempt to improve polite literature amongſt the riſing generation. In general, languid is the proſecution of ſtudy, when there is but little proſpect of ſeeing our labour crowned with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>LET us now conſider in a brief manner the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we may hope for from the execution of our deſign. Theſe are greater, and more in number, than ſtrike our notice at once. We ſhall firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:010082_0081_0F7C94E718561270"/>
the benefits which the STUDENTS of MEDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CINE will derive from it.</p>
            <p>IN a place ſo remote as Philadelphia from every ſchool of Phyſic, we cannot expect a very early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligence of all the medical diſcoveries and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements which are made in Europe. In eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing medical colleges, the profeſſors of each branch will find it incumbent on them to keep up a correſpondence with the learned abroad. They will thus get ſpeedy accounts of every thing new which may relate to their particular provinces. By improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this knowledge, they can diffuſe it amongſt their pupils, and, by their means, more readily propagate it through every part of the country.</p>
            <p>THAT this will be of the greateſt utility is manifeſt, if we rely on the authority of the moſt celebrated academicians. They ſtrongly recommend "to let none of thoſe diſcoveries eſcape us, which are daily brought to light by the labours of maſters in the art. Without this care, ſay they, the moſt conſummate practitioner, within the ſpace of twenty years, will be ignorant of thoſe truths which are then familiar to novices: the labours of others will thus become a ſource of labours to himſelf, and, without new ſtudy, his knowledge will decay into ignorance. Thus the celebrated practitioners in the time of Harvey, content with the knowledge which they had acquired
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010082_0082_0F7C94E7C3CC4A40"/>
from their predeceſſors, ſhut their eyes againſt the light which this great man preſented to them. They had made a long career in the exerciſe of their art, without knowing the circulation of the blood, which expoſed ſo many errors in the books of the ancients, and ſo many falſe ſteps in their proceedings; whilſt Novices, enlightned by this diſcovery, with reaſon deſpiſed theſe haughty practitioners who grew old in their errors."<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>STUDENTS are apt to be diſguſted with any art, when, at their firſt entrance upon it, they find it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with difficulties which to them appear unſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable; but when theſe begin to clear up, their eager purſuit of knowledge increaſes daily with growing pleaſure. A regular courſe of inſtruction prompts them to an eager purſuit of learning: it ſheds forth conviction upon the mind, and improves the confidence of the diligent; a confidence founded
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010082_0083_0F7C94E8C78A86D8"/>
on the juſt principles of demonſtration and reaſon. It is very certain that oral inſtructions and ocular illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions render ſcience eaſier, are more convincing, and make a more durable impreſſion than the beſt wrote treatiſes.</p>
            <p>A courſe of reading and obſervation is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, without other inſtruction, to qualify young men for practice; ſince many of the books of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine are full of obſcurity, or crouded with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, which puzzle the unexperienced reader, and often lead young minds aſtray.</p>
            <p>As the moſt precious metals in a ſtate of ore are mixed with droſs, ſo the choice truths of Medicine are frequently blended with a heap of rubbiſh. How va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable and neceſſary is an experienced profeſſor who knows how to clear this away; to preſent thoſe truths ſimple and pure from mixture; to trace them out under the various appearances they put on at differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent times, and to diſcover to ſtudents the clue of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning which they ought to purſue, in winding through a labyrinth of obſcurity, before they can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a clear knowledge of the more difficult parts of their profeſſion! That is to teach them how to philoſophize juſtly in medicine.</p>
            <p>THE greateſt genius left to itſelf is like the earth, when deſtitute of the ſun, incapable of bringing its productions to a perfect maturity. A courſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010082_0084_0F7C94E935191808"/>
inſtruction is to the mind like the rays of light darting through the obſcurity of Chaos. It diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pells the clouds that envelope the underſtanding, and enables the diligent ſtudent to penetrate into the ſecret receſſes of nature. Thus prepared, he is in a ſituation to enrich himſelf with thoſe treaſures of knowledge which the obſervers of nature have heaped together for many ages. He has a torch put into his hand to light him to the true ſcience of curing diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>As the practice of teaching is requiſite, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be able to explain the difficulties of any ſcience, and render the communication of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts familiar to others, it is neceſſary that perſons ſhould devote their time very much to it. This can only be done to good purpoſe, ſo that ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents may reap ample advantages therefrom, by means of inſtituting public profeſſorſhips.</p>
            <p>THE buſineſs of a Profeſſor is to place before ſtudents in a full light, at their firſt entrance upon any ſtudy, the true object of that ſtudy, and to aſcertain their proper purſuit. In performing this, he firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains to them the terms of art, and renders the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and ideas thereof familiar. He afterwards di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to what is the moſt proper courſe of ſtudy, and to the beſt authors to be conſulted on the ſubjects of which he treats. He points out the miſtakes which any of them may have run into, and puts them upon
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:010082_0085_0F7C94EB4DD69658"/>
their guard againſt ſuch errors as are apt to miſlead ſtudents. He ſupplies the defects of thoſe authors, And mentions what new light the lateſt diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſcoveries have thrown upon every ſubject. He thus points out the road which leads to ſcience, and prevents the young votary from running into a maze of doubts. He confirms his ſteps, ſmooths the rugged path he has to tread, aſſiſts him in climbing the ſteep aſcent, and, before diſmiſſion, informs him how he is to conduct himſelf, in order to reach at length to the ſummit of his profeſſion. Having a plan before him, a fixed end in view, and the means of attaining it within his reach, the ſtudent, impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with irreſiſtable ardor, preſſes forward, eager to reach the goal of knowledge and the height of all medical attainments; and ſince he is ſo well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his career, has the apparent proſpect of wiſhed for ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER manifect advantage of public lectures is, that they bring together a number of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of the ſame claſs of knowledge. If the profeſſor is a man who labours to improve the growing mind, he has it in his power to kindle an ambition in the breaſt of his pupils. An opportunity is put into his hands of examining the progreſs they make. They become acquainted, and ſometimes form ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties under the eye and direction of their teachers and maſters. They converſe, and write diſcourſes
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010082_0086_0F7C94EBC6378D80"/>
on ſuch literary and medical debates as tend greatly to their mutual improvement.</p>
            <p>As to what regards ſtudents themſelves, theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral particulars I am perſuaded are ſufficient to convince every judicious perſon of the neceſſity of inſtituting, in this ſeminary, profeſſorſhips in all the branches of the healing arts.</p>
            <p>THE great advantage which may be expected to accrue to the SEMINARY itſelf, from the eſtabliſhment of medical ſchools, is the advancement of the grand deſign of ſuch a ſeminary in general, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of ſome of the moſt uſeful branches of literature, that can embelliſh any ſeat of learning. If wiſdom and profitable ſcience are the glory, the ornament, the higheſt attainment of humane nature, and give the ſtrongeſt evidence of a people being enriched with generous and refined ſentiments, by which all poliſhed nations are ambitious of being diſtinguiſhed; then, moſt certainly, it becomes an object of the firſt conſideration with us to determine, whether the cultivation and patronage of this ſcience are worthy our moſt ardent purſuits, and whether we ſhall improve this opportunity which is now put into our hands for that purpoſe. It is needleſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you of what conſequence it is to take the lead in a deſign fo intereſting, ſo noble and important.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:010082_0087_0F7C94EC442DD300"/>THE reputation of every ſort of uſefull learning muſt be of great benefit to a CITY, as it will draw, from all parts, perſons that have a reliſh for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who will always prefer a place of education, in which the greateſt number of advantages coincide.</p>
            <p>THE reſort of ſtrangers to any city for the cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcience muſt give it proportionably a pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence over others. An education in any place begets that place an intereſt, and as it were naturalizes ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to it. In return for a diſpenſation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it collects a tribute of riches as well as of affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all quarters.</p>
            <p>AMONGST the benefits to be derived to the PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINCE from the eſtabliſhment of medical ſchools, I cannot paſs over a particular one, which ought to fire the ambition, and animate the induſtry of every ſtudent who has choſen to devote himſelf to the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of the healing arts.</p>
            <p>WE live on a wide extended continent of which but the ſmalleſt portion, even of the inhabited part, has yet been explored. The woods, the mountains, the rivers and bowels of the earth afford ample ſcope for the reſearches of the ingenious. In this reſpect an American ſtudent has ſome conſiderable advantages over thoſe of Europe, viz. The moſt ample field lies before us for the improvement of natural hiſtory. The countries of Europe have been repeatedly traverſed
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:010082_0082_0F7C94E7C3CC4A40"/>
by numerous perſons of the higheſt genius and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, intent upon making the ſtricteſt ſearch into every thing which thoſe countries afford; whence there is leſs hopes or chance for the ſtudents who come after them to make new diſcoveries. This part of the world may be looked upon as offering the richeſt mines of natural knowledge yet unriffled, ſufficient to gratify the laudable thirſt of glory in young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers into nature. The diſcovery muſt greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich medical ſcience, and perpetuate the glory of the authors to lateſt time.</p>
            <p>HOW many plants are there, natives of this ſoil, poſſeſſed of peculiar virtues? how many foſſils to enrich the cabinets of the curious? how many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſubſtances, objects of new trade and commerce to ſupply materials for various arts, as well as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the bounds of Medicince? what means are ſo likely to bring them to our knowledge as medical reſearches and careful experiments, proſecuted by thoſe inſtructed how to make them, and how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit themſelves of the diſcovery? A ſpirit of inquiry into theſe things would be put on foot as the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency of ſuch an inſtitution, and prove the moſt likely mrans of bringing to light the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many uſeful things, of which we yet remain ignorant, the more readily, as natural hiſtory is one of the moſt eſſential ſtudies to prepare a perſon
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010082_0089_0F7C94EDF89B93C0"/>
for proſecuting medicine with ſucceſs, and one of the moſt diſtinguiſhed ornaments of a phyſician and man of letters.</p>
            <p>FROM all theſe different views, I preſume none will deny the expediency, and neceſſty if I may ſo ſay, as well as the exceeding great benefits of the propoſed inſtitution to this ſeminary, city and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. Nor does the utility of it ſtop here. We may not only hope to profit ourſelves, but, in very many inſtances, contribute hereby to the advantage of the COLONIES, the vicinity and connections of which with ours might encourage many ſtudents to reſort hither. Thus the reputation and influence of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, becoming at length more univerſal, might extend themſelves as from a center, and include diſtant places within the circle of its uſefulnefs.</p>
            <p>FOR a few moments, ſuffer me here to beſpeak the attention of THE STUDENTS OF MEDICINE.</p>
            <p>HAVING now kid before you an obje6t worthy of your moſt earneſt regard; the nature of the ſtudies in which you are to engage; their extent, difficulty, importance and dignity being now pointed out, and a plan ſuggeſted to you, whereby your labours may
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010082_0090_0F7C94EE741E9338"/>
meet with a more certain ſucceſs; conſider well, Gentlemen, how much depends upon your own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.—Think how neceſſary it is to employ all your attention in order to accompliſh ſo valuable an end.—To this end place before your eyes the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious examples of great men, who, by puſhing their reſearches into the boſom of nature, have extended the bounds of uſeful ſcience. Tread in their ſteps, become indefatigable in the cultivation of medical literature, and be earneſt to bring it to perfection. The rewards of the rich, the countenance of the great, and the juſtly merited eſteem of the good and the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, which outlaſts the fleeting years of humane date, will not be wanting for your encouragement. You will be in a condition to practice the healing arts with ſkill and reputation, and to tranſmit your knowledge, and the benefits thereof, to a ſucceſſion of others. What is a moſt pleaſing reflection, thosſe who have been diſtreſſed by irkſome diſeaſes, and relieved by your ſkill, will own themſelves indebted to you for the life you have prolonged;—You will be ever remembered as the ornament and boaſt of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and be juſtly ſtiled guardians of the health of mankind.</p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations ought to animate you in the noble purſuit, and determine you to perſevere therein with unſhaken firmneſs and conſtancy. Be
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010082_0091_0F7C94F142439318"/>
not diſpirited at the difficulties which preſent, or the obſtacles you are to encounter. Let them ſerve ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a ſpur to your induſtry. They will not ſtand in the way of men who are determined to ſurmount all oppoſition in their courſe. Regard them as left by others for you to maſter. Was there no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty remaining, you would have leſs ſcope for a genius of inveſtigation; leſs honour in being barely followers of others. Both ſcience and honour offer one fate to their votaries. They reward the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the brave and of the ſteady, and repell the faint hearted and irreſolute. You have an ample field before you to cultivate. Inſpired by a love of ſcience, your diligent inquiry into natural cauſes and effects muſt produce diſcoveries; and theſe diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries prompt you with freſh alacrity to new reſearches; an employment as delightful and honourable as it is advantageous.</p>
            <p>ORDER requires that I ſhould now addreſs myſelf in particular TO THE TRUSTEES OF THE COLLEGE.</p>
            <p>To you HONOURED SIR, <note n="*" place="bottom">The governor of Pennſylvania, who is preſident of the truſtees.</note> and you GENTLEMEN who are truſtees of this ſeminary, the reſpected patrons of literature, who alone can give force and ſtability to undertakings of ſuch moment as this, I beg leave to return my warmeſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements

for the diſpoſition you have ſhewn of encouraging every attempt to promote ſcience in this plate; for your ready concurrence, with my propoſal of inſtituting medical ſchools in this ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; and for the honour you have conferred on me, in appointing me a profeſſor of the Theory and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of medicine. My gratitude cannot be manifeſted in a better manner, than in ſhewing the moſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous regard to the improvement of medical learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diligently proſecuting every meaſure which may be thought conducive to that end. I flatter myſelf nothing in my power ſhall be wanting to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the great purpoſes of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>THE learned Provoſt, vice Provoſt and faculty of the college have employed their unwearied care in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivating every branch of academical knowledge; and thus, with a ſucceſs anſwerable to their wiſdom and perſeverance, have carried this ſeminary to a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high pitch of reputation. Their induſtry I ſhall ſet before me as an example worthy of imitation, and ſhall conſult with them, in framing ſuch rules as may be thought expedient for the better regulating of phyſical exerciſes, and fixing the medical ſchools on the moſt reſpectable footing. From their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced judgement, and warm attachment to the intereſt of the college, I have room to hope for all the aſſiſtance they can yield me in carrying the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign into execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:010082_0093_0F7C94F240C2A420"/>Being aſſured of this, it is yours to perfect the plan which I have briefly ſketched out. Under your patronage we may hope that Medicine will put on the form of a regular ſcience, and be cultivated with ardor and ſucceſs; and that your influence will be employed to promote the ſeveral branches of it; to the eſtabliſhment and perfection of which are annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſequences, of the higheſt concern to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican colonies in general, to this province, this city, and this ſeminary in particular. It belongs to you to collect the ſcattered powers that are neceſſary to be united, in an attempt ſo important; and to tranſplant hither ſome of the moſt noble and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſciences that mankind are bleſſed with, the ſeeds of which, ſo opportunely ſown, will certainly produce a luxuriant growth of the moſt profitable knowledge.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS this Medical inſtitution, the firſt of its kind in America, though ſmall in its beginning, may receive a conſtant increaſe of ſtrength, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually exert new vigour. It may collect: a number of young perſons, of more than ordinary abilities; and ſo improve their knowledge as to ſpread its reputation to diſtant parts. By ſending theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad duly qualified, or by exciting an emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt men of parts and literature, it may give birth to other uſeful inſtitutions of a ſimilar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or occaſional riſe, by its example, to nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous.

ſocieties of different kinds, calculated to ſpread the light of knowledge through the whole American continent, wherever inhabited.</p>
            <p>SURE I am that you regard the riſing youth as the growing hopes of the country. You ardently wiſh that they may become eminent, in every qualification which can render them an ornament, or a bleſſing to their fellow creatures. You are, no doubt, anxious to encourage a ſpirit of literature amongſt them, and are attentive to procure them every advantage that may enable them to fill the higher offices of lite, and eſpecially the learned profeſſions, with ability and dignity. Nor do I imagine you will neglect any occaſion, ſuch as this which now offers, to anſwer theſe ſalutary purpoſes. Deſtitute of culture, the imagination of youth ſhoots wild and unprofitable; but, directed by art and improved by ſcience, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural genius is like a rich ſoil, the fruitful ſource of many benefits to a country.</p>
            <p>WHILST the ſtudies of youth are proſecuted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the encouragement and patronage of men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their literature and worth, they have the higheſt motives that can animate the purſuits of a generous mind.

They have heightened the character of particular people to ſuch a degree, as to make them regarded by other countries with admiration and eſteem. Such I hope will be the conſequence of your patronizing Medical ſcience in this place.</p>
            <p>THE difficulties of executing the propoſed plan are inferior, far inferior to the glory of being firſt in ſuch an undertaking.
