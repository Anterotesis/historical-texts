            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS it hath been of abſolute Neceſſity, that a certain Number of men ſhould be Impreſſed, for the Service of Their Majeſties, in Defence of this their Province, both at Sea and Land, againſt the common Enemy. And that ſome perſons imployed therein, have paſſed the Bounds of their Duty, and my Order, by putting the ſame in Execution in a violent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly manner, to the great Grievance of Their Majeſties good Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For preventing ſuch Diſorders for the future, and rendring to all injured Perſons due Satisfaction, I do hereby Publiſh and Declare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat as ſuch violent and undue methods have been uſed without my Knowledge, and to my great Diſturbance, there ſhall be effectual care taken, that ſuch as have received Damage thereby, ſhall Be Relieved, and all thoſe that have been the occaſion thereof ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
            <p>And all people whatſoever are to take notice, that no perſon ſhall hereafter be Preſt into their Majeſties Service, but by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Warrant to the Military Officers, or Conſtables, for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall preſume to Act contrary to their Duty upon any ſuch occaſion, all Juſtices of the Peace and all Officers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary and Civil, are Required in the Name of their Majeſties to cauſe them to be Seized, and Secured, in order to their being puniſhed, according to the utmoſt ſeverity of the Law.</p>
            <p>And whereas divers Souldiers Entered in their Majeſties Service and Pay, have preſumed to leave their Poſts, and ſome have out ſtaid their Paſs, without leave from their Commanders, others Impreſt for their Majeſties Service, have abſented and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared according to Order.</p>
            <p>I do therefore Order and ſtrictly Command, all ſuch Souldiers, forthwith to Repair unto their Reſpective Poſts, and Duty, as they will anſwer their Neglect at their Peril, and all Officers Military and Civil, that ſhall know, or be informed of any ſuch Deſerters or Runaway Soldiers, are to cauſe them to be taken up, and conveyed before the next Juſtice of the Peace, in order to their being Returned, and ſent unto their Reſpective Officers, and every Juſtice of the Peace, is hereby Impowred and Required to deal effectually, in this matter; and no Soldier may preſume to leave his Poſt, or abſent himſelf from his Duty, on pain of being proceeded againſt with utmoſt ſeverity of Law.</p>
            <p>And whereas a vigorous Endeavour to ſuppreſs the Growth of Wickedneſs and Prophaneneſs in this Territory, is not onely the way to obtain the gracious Preſence of Almighty God, without which we can expect no good Succeſs of our Affairs, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a thing for which Their Majeſties have given their particular Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>IT is hereby Required, That all the wholſome Laws here in Force againſt Vices of all kinds, and particularly the Laws againſt Blaſphemy, Swearing, Curſing, Lying, unlawful Gaming, Sabbath-breaking, Idleneſs, Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, and all Nurſeries and Inticements of ſuch Impietys, be in their Majeſties Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and impartially put in Execution. And all Juſtices, of the Peace, Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Tithing men, or what-ever other Officers, as well Civil as Military, as are therein concerned, are hereby directed, enjoyned, and in Their Majeſties Name Required, in this matter to diſcharge the Duty of their places, with all fidelity, and all ſorts of perſons to conform themſelves accordingly: And it is hereby ſignified, that upon Complaint made, and proved againſt any Officers; of having neglected their Duty, the utmoſt mark of Diſpleaſure ſhall be ſet upon them, while thoſe that are found faithful, ſhall be encouraged with all fit Acknowledgments. Given at Boſton, and Dated the 27th day of July, 1692. In the Fourth Year of Their Majeſties Reign.</p>
