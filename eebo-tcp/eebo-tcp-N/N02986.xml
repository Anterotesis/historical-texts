            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ICHES is commonly taken for a Plenty of the Necessaries for the Support of Human Life: And if every Man would seek the Good of others, as truly and sincerely, as men ought to seek their own; there would be no Occasion for any Man to have his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or Estate to himself. For every
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003576_0003_0FF82F99E6BCAFE0"/>
Man would labour sincerely, in his calling, for the Good of the Whole, the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,</hi> the <hi>Trades-man,</hi> the <hi>Merchant,</hi> the <hi>Sailor,</hi> the <hi>Ruler,</hi> the <hi>Teacher,</hi> and all other needful Employs. And all that is produced, would be for every one as he needs. And what People raise in one Country more than they need, would be carried to another Country that needs it. And what they of the other Country have to spare, would be brought back to the Country that needs it. And no <hi>Price</hi> would be talked of; but every man would labour faithfully in his calling to raise all he can; and the Merchants deal out, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and transport; the Carpenters build for such as need <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus all Men would have Plenty, and Contentions would cease, and most of the Miseries of this World would be taken away.</p>
            <p>It is an approved Way, <hi>Acts</hi> IV, 32. <hi>Sin</hi> is the only Hinderance: For now, since men love none but themselves, such a thing would be vain to talk of; few men would labour faithfully, and all things would come short, so that there is a Necessity that each man be the proper Owner of what his Industry raises. And

               <hi>Covetousness</hi> (which is Idolatry) must be the Support of the World, and the Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it both. Each man coveting to make himself rich, carries on the Publick Good: For Men cannot gain Riches and use 'em, except they help others by it. Thus God in his <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> turns our Wickedness to publick Benefit, or the World could not stand.</p>
            <p>Riches are given for Publick Good, and it is not in the Skill of the most co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and envious Man to make it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. It must be put to the use it was made for. He cannot swallow it all into his own Belly. Others must have part with him, or he cannot gain or keep his Riches. And he can have but his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Food and Raiment out of it, (for God has given him no more, and nothing more will do him good) and if Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness do not hinder, the poorest Man has <hi>that</hi> as well as he. He pleases him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he will leave his Riches to his Children. But how commonly doth this prove their Undoing for ever (as the gaining of it was to their Father) while Poor Mens Children by honest Industry prove happy in this Life and the next.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003576_0005_0FF82F9DAB597920"/>A rich Man is a <hi>Slave</hi> to others: while he thinks others are Slaves to him. He is a great Friend to the Publick, while he aims at nothing but serving himself. God will have us live by helping one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and since <hi>Love</hi> will not do it, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness</hi> shall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Merchant</hi> cannot gain his Riches, except he bring the Goods from other Lands, which they there have no need to keep, and give 'em in exchange what they need more, and bring to <hi>us</hi> what we need, or <hi>think</hi> we need; and take off from our hands for it, the Produce which we have no need to keep. He slaves and breaks his Rest to do this: and (if he deal <hi>honestly</hi>) they that deal with him have the Benefit, and he has <hi>the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it with his eyes,</hi> for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Eccl.</hi> V, 11.12. And if he deal <hi>knavishly,</hi> they that deal with him are wronged, and he must answer for it in the great Day. And while he is <hi>here,</hi> he cannot eat nor wear with the more Comfort.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>Husbandman</hi> raiseth more than he can eat and wear, is to feed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or he is never the better for it.

Thus while men covet <hi>All for themselves,</hi> they do others more good then they do themselves; but no Thanks to their good Intention.</p>
            <p>The like of the <hi>Tradesman,</hi> if he deal honestly.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Userer</hi> does no body good. He did not make the Money. He did not dig it out of the Ground: He did not bring it into the Country in Exchange for other Produce more needed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country. The Money had been in the Country, if he had never been. He hath his Heart's desire, to live for no body but himself. So the <hi>Landlord</hi> who lives upon his Rents: He did not make the Land, nor bring it into order for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. What good has he done in the World for his Money?</p>
            <p>But that we may view the Truth on both Sides of it; lest we take up a wrong <hi>Idea</hi> of it (the Neglect whereof is the Cause of all Errors) If he that gets his Money so easily, improve it and his Time in doing good, we have the less to say against him.</p>
            <p>And he that builds Houses, and rents 'em out, does publick good for his Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003576_0007_0FF82BDC9D050BF0"/>And if a Man borrow Money to make himself an Estate, by carrying on some profitable Design; his Money has done Publick Good: And it is just that the Owner of it should have a Reward from him that has made his Gain by it. But if a Man be in necessity, He that has it is bound to give or lend it for nothing, <hi>Exod.</hi> XX, 25. <hi>Deut.</hi> XV, 7.8.9.10.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> XVIII, 8.13.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>We are not made to live for our selves only. And tho' Sin has brought the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that every Man ought to know his own Property, and God will punish him that invades another's Property without his Consent: Yet God is the proper Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all, and we are but Stewards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted, and must give an Account to him, how we use all that we are intrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and must part with it as he pleases.</p>
            <p>So we may not lawfully withold from such as are in necessity. Yet they may not meddle with it without our Leave: that we may have the Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of giving it with a free Heart, or be punished if we refuse it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must be needy People to do good to. <hi>Deut.</hi> XV, 10.11.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>So the <hi>Lawyer</hi> is oft times so far from getting his Money by doing good, that he gets it by doing <hi>Harm,</hi> in helping Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to undo each other. The like of the <hi>Physician,</hi> if he take Money where he can do no good, or take extravagantly where he really does good.</p>
            <p>But let a Man come by his Goods <hi>just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> or <hi>unjustly,</hi> the more he has, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Slave he is, and the greater is his Uneasiness of Life here, and Difficulty in preparing for another Life.</p>
            <p>And if he come by any part unjustly, except he make Restitution to the utmost of his Power, he is utterly debarred from all Treasure in the next Life: and must surely be punished for all his Injustice. <hi>Psal.</hi> LXII, <hi>last. Levit.</hi> VI, 4.5.6.7. <hi>Num.</hi> V, 7.8.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ruler</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> if they receive so much as to support' em in their Work and Office, so as to be able to perform it well, it is as well as the Merchant, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman or Tradesman who deal honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But if they or the Merchant, Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman or Tradesman take more (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be plenty enough to afford it) it is no better than the Usurer or Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,

(which are useless ways of getting a Livelyhood) whereas the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be supported without the other.</p>
            <p>What a Man gains to himself, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Publick as much good as he does himself, and wronging no Man by doing it, is honestly and lawfully gotten, and nothing else that I can think of. And I think this may pass for an universal Rule. The Needy helped I do not call Gain: except by God's Blessing to the <hi>Giver.</hi> The Provision raised by the <hi>Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> make so much the more in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (yea in the World): So the Work of a <hi>Tradesman</hi>: So Fish and wild Beasts taken, and the like. So the <hi>Merchant</hi> exporting and importing, to the Benefit of both Countries. So a <hi>Physician</hi> when he cures a Disease, does good to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, by saving the Life or Health of a Member of the Common-wealth Some body has the Benefit more than he that gets Money by it. So a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> when he defeats the Design of a <hi>Knave.</hi> A <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> or <hi>Teacher,</hi> who is worthy of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, does the Publick much more good, than what he receives of the Publick.

            <p>What ever is gotten by making ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the poorer, (not helping him to something better for him, in the Room of it) is unjustly gotten: The Publick has no Benefit by it. And he that doth it, presumes to take into his own Hands, what God hath betrusted another with: which is a Rejecting of God's Authority, and Injuring the Person so made poorer.</p>
            <p>For these Reasons <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Robbery</hi> are unlawful, and accounted so <hi>intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> as to be punished with Death.

for their Souls, when they sell them for worldly Gain.</p>
            <p>A Rich Man has a <hi>miserable</hi> Life: for he is always full of Fear and Care: And the more he has, the more he wants. And if he lose any part of his Riches, the <hi>Grief</hi> of his Loss is far more than the Pleasure of calling it <hi>His</hi> was while he had it. And he can eat no more, nor wear with more comfort than a Man who has but sufficient from Hand to Mouth. Whereas a Man that has but Food and Raiment with honest Labour, is free from these Fears and Cares, and is not in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of such Grief for his Losses: And has the Comfort, that if Sickness disable him from Labour, the Rich must give him Food and Raiment: which is the highest they can enjoy themselves.</p>
            <p>If a Man have so much that he need not labour with his Hands, he must have a harder Labour with his Mind, and must break his Rest. While a poor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Man, who has no Expectation of rising higher, labours and rests, and eats and drinks with Comfort, and sleeps with a cheerful mind, <hi>Eccl.</hi> V, 12.

he is as bad of it as the Rich. He might better lose what he labours for. For more means to live, and more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Strength, (the Honour of a Beast, and yet we need it) may be got when more Health cannot, nor the other if Health be lost. Rest after moderate La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is a Pleasure, which those that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not cannot have: As Eating is made a Pleasure by Hunger. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, what Pleasure have we in this World (since Sin <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>If a Man live upon his <hi>Rents</hi> (a use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Life) and so be free from these Cares; he hath a far worse Life yet, except he take to some profitable Imploy suiting his Station.

If he seek it in Pleasure and Sports, it leaves him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied, and his mind worse disquieted than before. He must go to it again, to ease his <hi>uneasy</hi> mind, and what doth it help in the End? It cannot give the Contentment wich the performance of some profitable Work would give: And being still discontent, he seeks to please

            <p>And if he seek to satisfy himself with <hi>pleasurable</hi> Eating and Drinking (the Happiness of a Beast) he soon <hi>suffocates</hi> his Appetite and spoils it.

So that a Man, whose Portion is in this Life, is far worse of it, even in this Life, than a <hi>Beast</hi>: and especially those that lead a useless Life and live for Pleasure.

            <p>It is a great Benefit to a Country where there are many <hi>Rich</hi> Men, especially rich <hi>Merchants</hi> (but not rich Landlords nor Usurers:) For without <hi>these,</hi> Goods can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so well be exchanged from Country to Country. The People, who pretend not to the Riches, have the Benefit, and the Merchants the Slavery. Indeed, who that is <hi>wise</hi> would desire to be Rich, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be for Conscience sake? that he might do the good he sees needed in the Land. I suppose the most will readily dream this to be their Motive: But how few do shew it in their Practice! But God's Kindness to Men, who are not so kind to one another, makes covetous men by seeking to gratify their <hi>Idol</hi> Lust, to do the good they least desired.</p>
            <p>He that <hi>gains Riches</hi> must employ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who can eat and wear of it as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable as he can himself; which some

            <p>But what am I doing? If this discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage People from seeking after Riches, it would be a great Detriment to the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick, if not the undoing of the World. Yet I have no fear of hurting two Sorts of People by it. Those that make Riches their God, will not be dissuaded. For a Man will part with any thing, yea every thing rather than forsake his <hi>God.</hi> (As it is likewise with those that make some <hi>Faction</hi> their God.) And those that make Riches their God, are so very numerous among us; that I have little Fear of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Harm in this matter. And as little Hope of doing such Men good. For as the <hi>Eye</hi> fixed on a certain thing, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hindered from the Sight of other things. So the Mind and Heart <hi>fixed</hi> upon Riches, can see no Argument against them, nor against the covetous Interest.</p>

But my Fear is of spoiling those that are good for nothing already: by their taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse from it to be idle. Which is in it self sinful, and renders the idle Person un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to eat. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> III.10, 11.</p>
            <p>Industrious Labour keeps men's Tho'ts from studying <hi>Mischief,</hi> is <hi>healthy</hi> for the Body, and naturally gives a pleasant Mind, and fit for religious good. Whereas Want of Imploy brings all the contrary Evils. God has not made us to spend our Time for nothing.</p>
            <p>These Things considered, it follows: 1. We need to <hi>pity</hi> and <hi>love</hi> Rich Men. To pity them because of the Troubles and Temptations they undergo. And to love them, because of the publick Benefit we receive by them. Provided they be merciful Men, and do not make others poorer to make themselves richer: Nor by their Example in wasting Good on <hi>Foppish</hi> Pride, tempt Fools to fall to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</p>

            <p n="3">3. A <hi>selfish</hi> Spirit, which rules in almost every one, is a great wrong to themselves, and every one beside.

And if they see it to be for the good of <hi>All,</hi> and are willing to be Sharer in it, they would gladly have <hi>others</hi> be at the Charge: So that they will do so little for their part, that it must fall to nothing, and they that have expended <hi>nobly</hi> must lose it, and the Publick suffer the Want. How many a noble Design both for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and for Temporal Benefits is thus utterly lost! <hi>What Benefit will this be to ME?</hi> is all the Argument they can see into.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Of all Men <hi>publick spirited</hi> Men are the <hi>only</hi> Men worthy of Honour. For no other Men have any true Honour in them. Yet <hi>narrow spirited</hi> Creatures who love none but themselves, do neither regard love or honour 'em the more for it: but if they can make their own Gain by them they will not leave it.

When a Man, not moved with Pity nor Conscience, will sue (and with Law-Charges, undo) men, because they are not able to pay: and the Grief of it brings upon some of 'em a melancholy Distemper, which (being began, grows upon 'em, and so) makes 'em miserable all their Life after.

            <p>FOR a Help against some of these Things (if it may be done without Offence) I would humbly suggest to our honourable Legislators, the Enacting (some things which are in Force in some other Places) That <hi>he that troubles ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Law-Suit without necessary Cause, or puts him to more Charge than needs, shall pay for his Time and all the other Damages accrued thereby.</hi> And <hi>if it be made appear, that he that sues might have had his Money as well without su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it shall be deemed that he had sued

without Cause. And that he that sued before he have given timely Warning to prepare the Money</hi> (except it were a transient Person, or there were apparent Danger of his conveying himself or Goods out of the way) <hi>shall be deemed to have sued without cause.</hi> And to make Men careful, not to trust such as cannot pay 'em, <hi>That the oldest Debt shall be first paid; let who will have sued.</hi> Unless some such Acts be made, the Country is like to be undone by <hi>Law,</hi> (Conscience is so little used) And the Rulers that do it, will be a Blessing to the Land.</p>
            <p>It is impossible for the Laws to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against <hi>all</hi> Knavery. If that could be, there would be no room to know the Difference between honest Men and Knaves. Therefore it cannot be just to take all we can hold by Law. Yet Men designed for Damnation look no further. <hi>Psal.</hi> XCIV, 20.</p>
            <p>If we were so restrained that we could not sin at all, there had been no Room for a Reward for the Obedient.</p>
