            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Fatal Effects of Jealouſy.</head>
            <p>DON RAMIRO had been brought up in his infancy with young Iſabella Mendoſa, who was deſtined to be his wife. He loved her from a child. His paſſion for her increaſed with his years, and grew ſtronger with his reaſon. He was too amiable a perſon not to be beloved. Iſabella re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited tenderneſs for her with the ſincereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and every thing promiſed the two lovers all they wiſhed for, when cruel fortune made them ſuffer the ſevereſt trials.</p>
            <p>The Count de St. Eſtevan ſaw Iſabella, and fell in love with her to diſtraction: He believed too, that, if he did but aſk the conſent of her parents, he ſhould eaſily obtain her in marriage; for he was rich, had an honorable poſt at court, was of a very ancient family; and, as ſuch conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages pleaded in his favor, he actually made a propoſal to Iſabella's parents to marry her; but he had not the anſwer which he expected. The
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047415_0004_1023A0D8F793BCC8"/>
Marquis de Mendoſa ſaid, "He had long ſince promiſed his daughter to Don Ramiro, and that he could not prevail on himſelf to break his word, were the offer made to him ever ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>This denial was a ſenſible mortification to the Count de St. Eſtevan, but did not daunt him. The impatience of obtaining a good thing which if refuſed to us renders it precious to us, and the heart is never in a greater flutter than when it is agitated with the fear of loſing the object with which it is charmed. The Count laid his ſcheme to intereſt the court in his favor, and hoped that the Marquis de Mendoſa, who he knew was a crafty politician would alter his purpoſe, as ſoon as he ſaw it would be pleaſing to the Prince upon the throne. He ſet his friends at work, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his point.—The King ordered one of his Miniſters to ſpeak to the Marquis in the Count's favor. The Marquis immediately returned the ſame anſwer which he had given to the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of it; but it was conceived in ſuch terms as made the Miniſter believe it was not impoſſible but he might at length comply with his deſire. The view of the Marquis was that of an old Courtier. He was for enhancing the value of the ſacrifice that was demanded of him. He was ſenſible that if he made no conceſſion to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and appeared at the ſame time in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity how to act, the King would ſpeak to him about the affair himſelf.</p>
            <p>As he foreſaw, ſo it happened. The King ſpoke to him in favor of the Count de St. Eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, and urged the matter very home. The
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047415_0005_1023A0DB8D022B70"/>
crafty Courtier ſeemed to be in great tribulation, yet put on a ſubmiſſive air, and made anſwer, "That he thought his Majeſty did him too great an honor by condeſcending to intereſt himſelf in the concerns of his family." "I am much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, (ſaid the King) with your obedience, and will take care you ſhall find your account by it in due time and place." Theſe laſt words compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the misfortunes of the unhappy Don Ramiro. From that very inſtant the Marquis was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſacrifice him to his ambition. He thought himſelf the propere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> perſon to acquaint him of his misfortune, and took all the care poſſible to ſweeten the bitter pill: Therefore, before he diſcovered the matter to him, he made a long ſpeech upon the ſad neceſſity that perſons attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the court were under of conforming to the deſires of their Prince. In ſhort, he told Don Ramiro, that, by an order from court, he muſt reſign all thoughts of poſſeſſing Iſabella. Don Ramiro's aſtoniſhment as well as ſorrow was ſuch that he could make no anſwer. There are ſome ſituations ſo diſmaying, that the rejection of the heart throws a ſudden cloud over the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and then both ſeem alike inſenſible, becauſe the grief with which they are affected takes too deep root for them to give outward marks of it, and the ſoul muſt have ſome time to recover a power of acting. Don Ramiro came to himſelf again, and looking ſternly at the Marquis de Mendoſa. "I thought, (ſaid he) that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated and ſolemn promiſes you made to me would have been my ſure protection from the injury which you now do me. You deſire me never to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047415_0006_1023A0DDECF8AA30"/>
think more of Iſabella: You endeavor to perſuade me that you are forced to obey the King: but are you not Iſabella's father, and conſequently is ſhe not at your diſpoſal? The King is juſt, and, if you had but repreſented to him that you could not in honor break your engagement with me, he would not have required of you to commit an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that would ſtain your reputation."</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro was going on in this ſtrain, but the harſh terms he made uſe of gave ſuch a ſhock to the vanity of the Marquis, that with a ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful air, he returned him a rough anſwer, and left him abruptly. He was ſo exaſperated againſt him, that he was no ſooner alone but he ordered his daughter to be ſent for. He had not yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her of her misfortune, becauſe he tho't it proper to have that previous converſation with Don Ramiro. The moment Iſabella appeared before him, he ſaid to her, with ſome ſharpneſs, "Daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I make no doubt but you have the love and reſpect for me that you owe to me. You muſt, this moment give me a ſubſtantial proof of it, by renouncing Don Ramiro. The King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me to diſpoſe of you to the Count de St. Eſtevan; and what I demand of you is, that you look upon Don Ramiro as a man that I hate, and one that has offended me." Iſabella was ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at the thoughts of her deſtiny, that ſhe could not help uttering her complaints, though it was at the hazard of diſguſting her father. When misfortunes are come to a certain pitch, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the weakeſt ſouls with courage; and the proſpect of loſing all that is dear to us is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended with a reſolution to run all riſq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:047415_0007_1023A0DF87F3F320"/>
for preſerving it. "Were you to diſapprove of my tears ever ſo much, ſaid Iſabella, permit me, dear father, to vent them in abundance. If I am unfortunate, it cannot be owing to any cauſe, but the ſubmiſſion I always paid to your commands. I ſcarce knew what I was before you brought me acquainted with Don Ramiro; you diſpoſed of my heart in his favour; you deſired I would give it up to him entirely. You told me day after day that you ſhould judge of my obedience to you by the degree of love which I entertained for him. You commanded me to conſider him as a ſpouſe, that ought to be the dearer to me, becauſe he was of your own ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſing. Alas! could I diſpute or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that were ſo poſitive? Could I foresee that you would one day be so cruel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to revoke them? I have purſued, nay, intirely abandoned myſelf to the inclinations with which you inſpired me; I have only lived, for ſeveral years paſt, in hopes of having a ſpouſe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Ramiro, whoſe adreſſes, complaiſance, and amiable qualities, have deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all my love. And would you now require me, that I ſhould forget him all at once, and pluck that image out of my heart, which you yourſelf have engraved in it? Oh! father, by theſe knees of your's, which I now embrace, recall an order which is death to me. Take pity of an unhappy daughter, who has not deſerved to be ſo, and whoſe misfortunes it is in your power to put an end to. You gave me life: was it to render it miſerable? You make me no anſwer, you look another way. Alas! father, let me therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire at your feet, and thereby put a period to the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:047415_0008_1023A0E11069CC28"/>
cruel ſituation in which you have caſt me. You know how dearly I love Don Ramiro. You know the affection and eſteem I have for yourſelf. You demand, that I ſhould recall my heart from Don Ramiro: What would you have me do in this ſad dilemma? Being reduced as I am to the hard ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of failing in my duty to you, or betraying my lover; death is the only reſource I have left."</p>
            <p>"Your obſtinacy, replied the Marquis, deſerves to be puniſhed, and I ought to make you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> my authority, that you may learn the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul your inclination. I will leave you a little longer time to indulge your grief, after which I'll be obeyed, and admit of no farther plea. The Count de St. Eſtevan ſhall pay you a viſit; and prepare yourſelf to receive him as a perſon for whom you are allotted."</p>
            <p>Theſe laſt words completed. Iſabella's deſpair, and her grief was almoſt turned of fury; but it was checked by the preſence of her father, tho' it did not hinder her from diſcovering how deeply ſhe was in love. "No, ſaid ſhe, father, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſolve to abandon Don Ramiro, Exert all the authority you have over me; make me feel the effects of your indignation: I am ready to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to every thing; and, ſince I am come to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution not to obey the will of a father whom I adore, I fear not the worſt that can happen, but look upon it as a trifle, in compariſon with the object which has made you hate me."</p>
            <p>The Marquis, perceiving his daughter inflexible, was reſolved to act with ſeverity, "Well then, ſaid he, ſince you will not obey me, I will find ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:047415_0009_1023A0E3F200FAC8"/>
a way to prevent you from ſeeing Don Ramiro. I give you twenty-four hours time to determine your choice, either of the Count de St. Eſtevan, or a Convent." "The moſt cruel impriſonment, replied Iſabella, will be a pleaſure to me, as it will ſave me from the horrid fate of being the wife of any other man in the world, if I cannot have Don Ramiro." "Withdraw, replied the Marquis, I begin to be out of patience with your obſtinacy, and you treſpaſs too far upon my forbearance." Iſabella retired from her father's apartment to her own, to give full vent to her grief.</p>
            <p>Nature has certain prerogatives, which the hardeſt hearts cannot reſiſt. When the Marquis de Mendoſa was left alone, he could not but feel the ſecret reproach of his conſcience for the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity with which he had treated his daughter; but this remorſe of his, though there was ſo juſt an occaſion for it, did not laſt long. Iſabella was ignorant, in the mean time, whether Don Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro was a ſharer in her trouble. Her father had not let her into the ſecret of his diſguſt with him, nor did ſhe know the occaſion of the enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two perſons that were ſo dear to her. Though ſhe could not ſpeak to her lover, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to write to him. She acquainted him of the injunction laid upon her not to ſee him any more, and painted her condition with all its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. The domeſtic who carried her letter brought back an anſwer to it. She then perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe was unfortunate to the laſt degree. Don Ramiro, conjured her, by the love ſhe had for him, not to forget him; and aſſured her, that his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:047415_0010_1023A0EAB477A400"/>
life was in her hands, and that he would hold it by no other tenure than her conſtancy.</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro's grief was no ſmall addition to Iſabella's How to alter her condition ſhe could not deviſe; nothing occurred to her thoughts, but what was gloomy and a afflicting; yet ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined a convent was the beſt place, for there ſhe hoped to receive tidings from Don Ramiro, with more eaſe than ſhe could at home; At leaſt ſhe was ſure of not being teazed by the Count de St. Eſtevan, whom ſhe looked upon as the only cauſe of her misfortunes. She had alſo ſome faint hopes, that, in time her father might alter his mind. How great ſoever the perplexity of the mind is, yet, till the evil is apprehended actually happens, there always remains ſome glimmer of hope. The underſtanding and the heart, which are ſo often at variance in good fortune, unite their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in adverſity, to aſſiſt each other.</p>
            <p>Iſabella, being reſolved to go into a convent, did not think it proper to ſtay for another melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly converſation with her father. She imparted her deſign to one of the women of her bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and, having contrived a way to leave the houſe without being perceived, ſhe ſtepped into a coach that waited for her, and drove to an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, where the Abbeſs was her intimate friend and relation.</p>
            <p>When the Marquis de Mendoſa heard that Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belly was gone off, he poſted with his complaint to the King, not ſo much out of a fondneſs to ſee his daughter, as to convince the Sovereign of the vigour with which he had acted in obedience to his orders. When he ſpoke to him he exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:047415_0011_1023A0EC408865F8"/>
the ſtruggle he had within his breaſt to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount a fatherly tenderneſs, and concluded by aſſuring him that he was too ſenſible how much it was his duty to conform to his intentions, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to he biaſſed by the tears of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The King ſeemed pleaſed with the conduct of the Marquis, yet he was not willing that the ſanctuary which Iſabella had choſen ſhould be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated: "She'll be weary, (ſaid he to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis) of ſuch a melancholy retirement; and you will find her hereafter more tractable, and more ſubmiſſive to your commands."</p>
            <p>The Marquis overjoyed that he had made his court ſo well, thought of nothing now but how to break off all correſpondence betwixt his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Don Ramiro. He petitioned the court that the Abbeſs might be obliged to receive a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he convent that was a creature of his, in order that she might be a ſpy upon Iſabella. His ſuit was granted, and the nuns were ordered to prevent any correſpondence between Don Ramiro and Iſabella.</p>
            <p>The Count de St. Eſtevan was too much in love with her, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. He thought it impoſſible but that Iſabella muſt fall in love with him ſooner or later. His birth and his riches had made him intolerably conceited; and he was likewiſe obſtinate, paſſionate and Jealous. He ſent to Iſabella ſeveral times to deſire ſhe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:047415_0012_1023A0EDC81B5CF8"/>
would give him leave to viſit her at the grate; but ſhe always refuſed him, and not without ſcorn. Theſe marks of hatred and contempt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated the Count, who was now reſolved to haſten his marriage, and to prepare for removing every obſtacle that oppoſed it. His vanity was ſo offended, that it made him conſider Iſabella's charms with no other view than to render him unhappy; and he was ſo baſe a man as to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a deſire of marrying her as much out of ſpite as love. After he had conſidered with himſelf a long while what courſe he ſhould take to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his deſign he thought of none ſo expedient as that of removing Don Ramiro at a good diſtance from Iſabella; which, how difficult ſoever, he did not think impoſſible: Fortune favored him, a few days after this reſolution, with an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity which he could not have flattered himſelf with the hopes of.</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro had found means, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Marquis de Mendoſa's precautions, and the vigilence of the woman whom he had placed in the convent to be a ſpy upon her, to write to Iſabella, and to receive letters from her. This correſpondence had laſted ſome weeks. The nun, who was her confident, being very much preſſed to it by Don Ramiro, propoſed to Iſabella to ſee him in private, and gave her ſuch hopes of the ſucceſs of the aſſignation, that she could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand her longings to ſee the lover from whom ſhe was parted. It was agreed that Don Ramiro ſhould come in the night time, over ſuch a part of the garden walls as was not ſo high as the reſt, and return after his viſit the ſame way. In ſhort,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:047415_0013_1023A0EF902CABB8"/>
every thing ſeemed to be ſo well concerted, that 'twas thought impoſſible for any accident to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat it.</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro, having received the letter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Iſabella advertis'd him of the time and place of repairing to the garden, did not fail of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither according to the appointment; but as his ill luck would have it, when he was got upon the wall, he was diſcovered by a perſon who was walking with two ſervants behind him, in the ſtreet next to the garden. This perſon was a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty too much concerned to know who was got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the convent to leave any ſtone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>turned for ſtopping him. Therefore he ſent for the watch, and poſted it at the very place where he imagined Don Ramiro was to come back. After he had made this diſpoſition, the Count de St. Eſtevan, for he was the perſon, ſent to acquaint the nuns that there was a man in the garden.</p>
            <p>The time which it neceſſarily took up to get the convent open in the night, gave Don Ramiro leiſure to fall at the feet of his dear Iſabella, and to ſay the tendereſt things to her in the phraſe of a lover. She, in her turn aſſured him that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could rend him from her heart, and that ſhe had rather live and die in a convent than become the wife of the Count de St. Eſtevan.</p>
            <p>While theſe two lovers little thinking of the freſh misfortune that threatened them, were giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other the moſt reciprocal marks of their love, they heard a confuſed noiſe in the convent, which obliged them to ſeparate. Don Ramiro haſtened to make his retreat over the wall; but no ſooner was he got down, than the men who
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:047415_0014_1023A0F41DEAB4E8"/>
had been poſted there for the purpoſe ruſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and, without giving him time to prepare for his defence, took away his ſword, and then in the King's name charged him to follow them. The Captain of the watch cauſed him to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted afterwards to priſon, and drew up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation againſt him, which he laid next day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Solicitor General.</p>
            <p>The Count de St. Eſtevan, though the ſole author of the misfortune that happened to Don Ramiro, did not appear to have had any hand in it; for the man he had ſent for the watch, and he who gave notice to the nuns, were both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. It was mere accident that brought the Count into this ſtreet, juſt as Don Ramiro was clambering the wall; and it was jealouſy which made him believe that it could be no body but his rival. He knew of what importance it was to get him arreſted, and imagined now that his ruin was unavoidable, the violation of the walls of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent being in Spain a capital crime. His deſign ſucceeded but too well. The lawyers prepared his indictment, and the death of Don Ramiro was next to a certainty. He had not a word to plead in his excuſe, and he had the poſitive evidence of all thoſe who had taken him. This affair was the talk of the whole city of Madrid, where Don Ramiro was generally beloved; All men of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our pitied him, and ſolicited for him, but ſcarce hoped for any ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The ſorrowful Iſabella was almoſt diſtracted, and reproached herſelf that ſhe had been the cauſe of the ruin of her lover. The melancholy to which ſhe abandoned herſelf was ſuch, that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:047415_0015_1023A0F838D3DA00"/>
her friends dreaded it would put a period to her days. Her father the Marquis de Mendoſa was alarmed at it; and the Count de St. Eſtevan who was informed of it by a nun he had bribed, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that Iſabella would not long ſurvive Don Ramiro. He had too great an affection for her to ſeek her deſtruction, and reſolved to employ his own and his friends credit to ſave Don Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's life. He had hitherto done every thing that was in his power underhand, to ruin him; and though he now left off his intrigues, yet he was ſtill in hopes of making his rival's misfortune ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to his purpoſe of obtaining Iſabella. He imparted his deſign to the Marquis de Mendoſa, and made him ſenſible that it would not be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to procure a pardon for Don Ramiro, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that Iſabella would forget him. The Marquis approved of the Count's propoſal, and promiſed to ſpeak of it to his daughter. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the convent, and having ſent for his daughter, deſired to ſpeak with her alone. The grief with which you are oppreſſed, ſaid he, melts my heart into compaſſion, and I will, if poſſible, put a ſtop to it. You dread the thoughts of Don Ramiro's death; you reproach yourſelf with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of the ſentence which is ſoon to be paſſed upon him, while it is in your power not only give him life but to reſtore him to liberty. "Alas! my father, cried Iſabella, if Don Rami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro is to live, I am happy indeed! What, ſhall I be ſo fortunate as to pluck him from the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fate that attends him? Can I preſerve that life to him which he is to loſe through my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence?
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:047415_0016_1023A0F9C5DE9FE0"/>
Nay, can I alſo reſtore him to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with life? Say but the word, father, there's nothing that I will not do."—"One word is ſufficient, (replied the Marquis) and you ſave Don Ramiro: One ſingle yea delivers him out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The Count de St. Eſtevan deſires to have you in marriage. The King countenances his ſuit. Do you but give your content, and Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro is free." "It, (ſaid Iſabella, diſſolving in tears) if that is the only way I have left to ſave Don Ramiro's life, I rather chuſe to die with him; he loves me too well to conſent to live upon ſuch a condition as that, and would be ſorry that I had prevented his death by ſuch a conceſſion.

anſwer, father; what have I done to deſerve this harſhneſs with which you caſt me down?"</p>
            <p>"Daughter, (replied the Marquis, at the ſame time that he raiſed up Iſabella from her knees) it is not from anger that I do not make you an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; it is becauſe I have nothing to ſay for your comfort, as glad as I ſhould be to aſſuage your grief and to ſave Don Ramiro. Your hand is the price of his life, and upon no other condition can his pardon be granted. He will be indebted for it to the Count de St. Eſtevan, who by his marriage with you takes upon him to obtain it of the King, though his Majeſty has refuſed it to all others who have ſolicited it. The time is very preſſing, and perhaps when you would be glad to ſave Don Ramiro's life it may be too late: His ſentence is juſt ready to be paſſed; after which it will not not be poſſible to prevent the execution of it. If his life be as dear to you as you ſay it is, haſten to ſave it."—" If it be dear to me! repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iſabella, good God! can you ſo much as doubt of it? Have you not taken ſufficient care to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear him to me? You opened that frightful abyſs into which you have now plunged me, when I was but an infant. Since it muſt be ſo, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to periſh: I will die and Don Ramiro will follow me to the grave. He has too great an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for me to take it amiſs of me that I did not ſave a life which he could not ſpend with me." "Very well, replied the Marquis, with ſome bitterneſs, your obſtinacy will meet with its due reward; and, ſince you are willing that Don Ramiro ſhall die, you ſhall have your deſire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> I will go myſelf to haſten it, and to demand juſtice
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:047415_0018_1023A100A18275F0"/>
for the offront he has put upon me, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delible ſtain with which he has diſgraced you. I will join iſſue with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nuns who proſecute him, and animate all that ſeek his ruin." The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis had no ſooner ſaid this than he was retiring; but Iſabella cried out to him with a faint and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dying voice, "Stay, father, ſtay, Don Ramiro's life muſt be ſaved: no <hi>I</hi> cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that he ſhould periſh; <hi>I</hi> could not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the horror that <hi>I</hi> felt, juſt as you was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to part from me; all the misfortunes that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs me are nothing to my anguiſh at the view of his approaching death, but how much more ſhould <hi>I</hi> ſuffer by his death itſelf? Save Don Ramiro's life, <hi>I</hi> will obey." At theſe words Iſabella fainted away. The Marquis called for perſons to relieve her, who, with great difficulty brought her to herſelf; and then ſhe deſired to be carried to her chamber.</p>
            <p>The Marquis ſatisfied with his daughter's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, was not much concerned at her fainting fit, in which he thought there was no great danger, but looked on it as the laſt ſtruggle of a paſſion, which her marriage with the Count de St. Eſtevan would quickly ſmother; and he went to carry him the news of his daughter's conſent. The Count, overjoyed, that his project had ſucceeded ſo well, put his friends upon employing their intereſt at court; and the King granted Don Ramiro a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: But before it was delivered to him, St. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tevan was for concluding his marriage. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Iſabella was accordingly married to Don Ramiro's mortal enemy, whom yet the conſidered as his deliverer. The ſervice which ſhe imagined
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:047415_0019_1023A1022817BF88"/>
the Count had done Don Ramiro, rendered him leſs hateful in her eyes, and honour made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to do every thing in her power to ſtifle a paſſion, which, after her marriage, ſhe thought would be criminal. Nay, ſhe was determined to try, by all means, to raiſe her affection for a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to whom ſhe had only been married by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion.</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro had heard nothing of all this in his priſon, where he was abandoned to the moſt melancholy ideas. He wiſhed his Judges would haſten the moment of his death, and the thought of its being near at hand was the only comfort he had, at the time that the news was brought him that the king had ſigned his pardon. At firſt he imagined that Iſabella's fate could not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, ſince his own was ſo much mended; and this ſingle thought was no ſmall addition to his joy. Now then, ſaid he, I will reviſit the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Iſabella. I hope to have leave to die at her feet, and to atone for the misfortunes that <hi>I</hi> have brought upon her. "<hi>I</hi> adviſe you, ſaid the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who brought him his pardon, to avoid Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's company; ſhe will but increaſe your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles." "No, no ſaid Don Ramiro, bluntly interrupting him, <hi>I</hi> make no account of life but to ſee, to love, and to adore, Iſabella. If I were to renounce her, the pardon granted to me would be a cruel puniſhment." "But what hopes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the perſon can you have now? For ſince ſhe is married"—"What! married! ſaid Don Ramiro. Ah! then <hi>I</hi> muſt die." His ſorrow making his ſpeech faulter, he was quite <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weight of his misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:047415_0020_1023A103E1A77698"/>
In this ſtate Don Ramiro remained for near a quarter of an hour; but, ſorrow having at length recalled his ſoul to itſelf, his dejection was ſoon ſucceeded by rage. "What! ſaid he, has Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella betrayed me? Has that Iſabella, whoſe heart I always thought full of tenderneſs for me abandoned me? Has ſhe even married my rival? Ah! cruel one, I will diſappoint you, and you ſhall no longer feaſt your eyes with the grief of a lover whom you have drove to deſpair."</p>
            <p>The perſon who had acquainted Don Ramiro with Iſabella's marriage, not thinking that this news would have had ſuch an effect upon him, endeavoured to pacify him by a vindication of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabella's conduct. He knew that this amiable young lady only conſented to marry the Count, in order to ſave Don Ramiro's life; he therefore gave him a particular detail of what his unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate miſtreſs had ſuffered, and of the neceſſity ſhe was reduced to of giving her hand to the Count de St. Eſtevan for that very purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro obſerved a penſive ſilence during the narrative of his dear Iſabella's misfortunes, and his rage, by degrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> abated. Every token of his miſtreſs's love made that impreſſion upon his heart which reaſon operates on a mind that is ſomewhat diſturbed. At length, the paſſion which he had for Iſabella having recovered intire poſſeſſion of his ſoul, he cried out, in a plaintive tone, "Alas! Why has ſhe loved me to ſuch a degree! Or rather, why did ſhe not let me die? What ſhall I do with a life that I ſo much hate?"</p>
            <p>While Don Ramiro was thus complaining, the officers of juſtice came to ſet him at liberty. He
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:047415_0021_1023A10895730720"/>
was ſo afflicted, that he made them no anſwer, but went out with them, plunged in deep medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and, at the bottom of the ſteps of the priſon in which he had been confined, found a coach, which carried him home. He no ſooner ſet down, than he wrote a letter to Iſabella, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of his hard lot; but her anſwer made him more uneaſy than before. He ſaw that ſhe had ſtill the ſame kindneſs for him; he was fully ſenſible of the ſacrifice which ſhe had made to ſave his life, yet this ſame Iſabella was he obliged to ſhun; and death, which he thought the only remedy for his misfortunes, was not permitted him. In this ſad ſituation Don Ramiro reſolved to indulge melancholy till it put an end to his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and in this way did he live for above three months, when a man, altogether unknown to him, deſired to ſpeak with him. "<hi>I</hi> come, Sir, ſaid he, to reveal a ſecret to you, which it highly concerns you to know. I was many years a domeſtic of the Count de St. Eſtevan, and it is not above a month ſince I left his ſervice, <hi>I</hi> am now going to leave Madrid; elſe ſooner or later, I ſhall feel the Counts reſentment. Shall I tell you the very thing that has puſhed him to ruin me? He is afraid le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t I ſhould acquaint you, that it was he who diſcovered you when you got over into the convent. He has always perſecuted you ſince; and, while you was in priſon, I went with him very often, to ſeveral of your judges, whom he ſolicited to ruin you. It is true he had a hand in procuring your pardon, when your miſtreſs had conſented to marry him. I hope you will not ſuffer the ſecret I tell you to be divulged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:047415_0022_1023A10C9E1A6FA8"/>
I am gone from Madrid. Nothing could ſave one from his fury if he knew that I had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you of his behaviour, he being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual alarm for fear his ſpouſe ſhould come to the knowledge of it."</p>
            <p>While the domeſtic was purſuing his narrative, Don Ramiro was in a perfect rage. "The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous wretch, ſaid he, ſhall moſt certainly die; his impoſture ſhall have its due reward"</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro, without delay, prepared to put his menaces into execution. He wrote two let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, one to Iſabella, wherein he told her what her huſband had done, and the other to the Count, inviting him to decide, without any one's privity, a quarrel, for which nothing could put an end, but the death of one of them.</p>
            <p>Iſabella was gone to pay a viſit to her ſiſter the Marchioneſs del Prado, when the domeſtic deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the letter to the Count. He was nettled at it to the laſt degree; and, though he was more brutiſh than brave, he was ſo animated by his pride and reſentment, that without waiting for Iſabella's return, he went out that very moment alone to the place appointed. The two antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts were no ſooner met, but without any parley they drew their ſwords and fought furiouſly. They had each received ſeveral wounds, but their rage hindered them from perceiving that they had loſt blood. Don Ramiro vexed at meeting with ſuch reſiſtence, from a rival whom he deſpiſed as much as he hated, was determined to put an end by one puſh to a duel which had laſted ſo long, and, making a full paſs at the Count, ran him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the breaſt; but he received a ſlab in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:047415_0023_1023A10E25664F70"/>
of his belly, which was altogether as danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Theſe two laſt thruſts diſabled the two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants alike at one and the ſame time, and both loſt ſo much blood that they could no longer ſtand on their feet, but fell down both together, the moment that a coach came to them.</p>
            <p>Whoſe coach ſhould this be but Iſabella's, who, receiving Don Ramiro's letter when ſhe came home, and finding upon enquiry, that her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was gone out alone, made no doubt but he had ſome duel on his hands. In her confuſion ſhe happened alſo to go into the Count's chamber, and perceived a letter on the table, which, by the hand-writing ſhe gueſſed to be Don Ramiro's; and it was indeed the very challenge he had wrote to his rival. Iſabella needed no farther informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to direct her to the place ſhe was to go to. When ſhe alighted out of the coach. She ran towards her huſband, who hardly knew her, and was ſo weak, that he could not ſpeak. Iſabella turned her eyes every now and then to Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro, whoſe condition was altogether as danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Duty engaged her to ſupport her huſband, love called her attention to her lover: her care was engaged for the Count, her wiſhes for Don Ramiro. She was ſenſible that ſhe ought that inſtant to have carried her huſband to town but then Don Ramiro would have been left without any manner of help. Love prevailed over de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum, and ſhe ſtaid till her ſervants had carried Don Ramiro to a neighbouring convent. The Count, as faint as he was, had ſenſe enough to perceive what reaſons his wife had for not return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:047415_0024_1023A110F0AE3438"/>
with more ſpeed to Madrid. Theſe his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy pointed to him in the blackeſt colours, and nothing but his being ſo faint hindered him from exclaiming againſt Iſabella with the moſt bitter reproaches. The unfortunate Don Ramiro was ſenſible alſo of the obligations which he had to his miſtreſs; and, though he ſpoke very low, and though Iſabella made him no manner of anſwer, the Count ſuſpecting that there was an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding between them, and the more he reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the more he was confirmed in it; ſo that during the firſt days of his illneſs he thought of nothing elſe. His duel was not unknown at court; but, as neither his wounds nor thoſe of Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro were mortal, juſtice took no cognizance of the matter, and there was no proſecution.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Count de St. Eſtevan had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſpirits to ſhew his reſentment. He rallied Iſabella with all the ſharpneſs that could be. "I do not know what you mean, replied Iſabella, and, if you really imagine that I was any way concerned in your duel, you would be the moſt ungenerous of mortals." "Nay, replied the Count in a rage, it was you that fet on Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro to attack me. I ſaw the confuſion of your countenance, when he was wounded. Regardleſs whether I lived or died, you thought of nothing but the danger you ſuppoſed he was in. He could not command his temper enough, not to expreſs his grateful ſenſe of it to you before my face: and I ſaw him thank you for it. My eyes ready to be cloſed for ever, expoſed both my own diſgrace and yours to me. But would to God I had been
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:047415_0025_1023A112D2D359E8"/>
ſtrong enough at that inſtant to have ſtabbed your lover to the heart, and you after him!"</p>
            <p>"I am not deaf, ſaid <hi>I</hi>ſabella with an Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant air, to the reproaches which you have caſt upon me; reproaches as worthy of you as they are unworthy of me. My virtue defies the blackeſt calumney; nor do I fear the ſlander of the huſband to whom cruel fortune has been pleaſed to join me. But, for my own ſatisfaction, I muſt tell you what perhaps you never yet knew. I loved Don Ramiro from my very infancy. The unhappy paſſion which you entertained for me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of him for ever. I conſented to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry you in order to ſave his life, and reſolved from that time to baniſh him from my heart; but I perceived that my efforts were vain, and that his image haunted me wherever I went. Mean time I turned my duty into a ſevere law. Mean time I turned my duty into a ſevere law. I ordered Don Ramiro to keep out of my ſight: <hi>I</hi> lived with you in the beſt manner I could; I fell in with every thing that I thought could pleaſe you, and even wiſhed I could love you. When my heart was in ſo uneaſy a ſituation, I learnt that you was the ſole author of my misfortunes, and thoſe of Don Ramiro. <hi>I</hi> find that it was you that cauſed him to be apprehended. <hi>B</hi>arbarous as it was; and as much an abhorrence as I have for ſo ſhocking a deed, I perſevere in my duty, and my virtue is not ſhaken. I found by a letter lying on your table the place appointed for your duel with Don Ramiro. I ran thither to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate you, but could not arrive ſoon enough. You reproach me for ſhewing a concern at the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which I ſaw my lover. I was concerned,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:047415_0026_1023A1182C592A28"/>
no doubt, and am not aſhamed to own it. Alas! why ſhould I not pity a virtuous man; one who is truly worthy of being beloved, and who is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate for my ſake? Thus have you now heard what I had to ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o you."</p>
            <p>At theſe words the Counteſs went out of her huſband's chamber, and left him ſeemingly abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a profound reverie. The ſincere confeſſion which ſhe had made put him into ſuch a ſtate, that he could not diſtinguiſh right and a wrong. He was ſmitten with the tokens which Iſabella had given him of her honeſty and firmneſs of mind. He admired her frankneſs and ſincerity; but, on the other hand, his jealous temper inclined him to think, that, as ſhe had an affection for Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro, it would not be long before ſhe ſhook off the yoke of troubleſome virtue, and that the firſt opportunity ſhe would betray him. The affront he had lately put upon her increaſed his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. We commonly judge of others hearts by our own. The wicked imagine that the moſt commendable actions are only artful cloaks for knavery.</p>
            <p>Such tormenting thoughts were quickly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by rage, and he reſolved to be revenged the very firſt opportunity, both upon Iſabella and Don Ramiro. He would have been glad to have gone that inſtant from Madrid, and to have carri-his ſpouſe to one of his country ſeats, but his wounds hindered him from ſetting out as yet. He was therefore under the neceſſity of bearing all with patience.</p>
            <p>While the Count thought of confining his wife in ſome ſolitary place, far from court, Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:047415_0027_1023A11B06470E40"/>
being perfectly cured of his wounds, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to quit not only Madrid but Spain, and to travel in foreign parts. He had no hopes of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any alleviation of his ſuffering, while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at Madrid. He thought abſence would be his only relief. Love is excited and animated, more than any paſſion, by the nearneſs of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro was juſt upon ſetting out for France; but he could not reſolve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o quit Spain, without acquainting Iſabella of it. Iſabella received his letter, and read it ſeveral times, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhedding tears. The departure of her lover, is neceſſary as ſhe thought it, overwhelmed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with grief. She had been plunged a long time in theſe melancholy reflections, when word was brought her that her father was come. She went out of her chamber to receive him, and threw Don Ramiro's letter into a little box upon her toilet. Whether it was that ſhe had not time to lock it, or whether ſhe really forgot it, her huſband coming ſoon after into her chamber, while ſhe was in another room with her father, had the jealous curioſity to peep into this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ox where he knew Iſabella ſometimes kept her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. There he found Don Ramiro's letter, which he read and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid again in its place; but was in ſuch a violent paſſion, that from that moment he formed a deſign to be the ruin of Don Ramiro, and to ſecure his wife in a cloſe priſon for her life. Nevertheleſs he reſolved to take no notice till the moment he could work his revenge.</p>
            <p>The wicked are more maſters of their tempers than thoſe who mean well. The ſentiments of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:047415_0028_1023A3925C3D4368"/>
the latter are painted on their faces; and in vain would they ſeek to diſſemble; for their looks, their language, in ſhort, every thing would betray them. True virtue can bear no maſk of any ſhape whatſoever; but diſſimulation is the art of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The more heinous the crimes are which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, the more art have they to conceal them.</p>
            <p>The Count de St. Eſtevan had a ſoul ſo baſe, that he was ſure of putting the revenge he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived into execution, without any poſſibility of preventing it. He propoſed to his wife to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to one of his eſtates; Iſabella who only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a ſolitary retirement from the world, and was the more earneſt for it after ſhe had heard of Don Ramiro's journey, readily conſented to her huſband's offer; and ſhe even preſſed him to ſet out with all ſpeed.</p>
            <p>The Marquis de Mendoſa who thought differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently from his daughter, was very ſorry to find her going into the country. He only matched her to the Count de St. Eſtevan, thinking that the rank ſhe would hold at court would make her inſtrumental to his ambition; but now all his hopes would be fruſtrated by being deprived of his daughter, and he ſhould reap no advantage from having made her unhappy. He did what of lay in his power with the Count to hinder from leaving Madrid: but could obtain nothing him. He feared and not without reaſon, how paſſionate and jealous he would be, when he was at a diſtance from the court and could act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſtraint. Theſe mortifying ideas, which were but too well founded, determined the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis to place a waiting maid with his daughter on
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:047415_0029_10239D344271F618"/>
whom he could depend, and who promiſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him how Iſabella fared, and how her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band behaved to her.</p>
            <p>The Count ſet out for his eſtate, continuing his diſſimulation, and making no diſcovery <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it could give Iſabella the leaſt ſuſpicion of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid deſigns which he was contriving, and putting into execution. This barbarian had poſted aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins in Don Ramiro's road, who, after having murdered him, were to bring him his heart: but Don Ramiro's good fortune preſerved him from the ſnares that were laid for him. His valet-de-chambre happening to receive a wound by a fall from his horſe, two leagues from the wood where the ruffians were poſted. Don Ramiro did not care to ſtop, but ordered him to be put into his chaiſe, and carried gently to the next town: then he mounted his horſe, taking only one footman with him, leaving the other to take care of the valet-de-chambre. The aſſaſſins, ſeeing two men paſs by upon a gallop, thought they were Don Ramiro's domeſtics going to get poſt horſes ready at the next ſtage. They were overjoyed to think, that the man whom they aimed at was deprived of that aſſiſtance which he might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have had, and lay concealed in that poſt. An hour after came Don Ramiro's chai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, which they preſently knew to be the ſame the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> were to attack. They fired at the poſtilion, and killed him; the lacky, who was on horſeback, ſeeing him fall, turned about his horſe, and rode back. The aſſaſſins, having him who was in the chaiſe at their mercy did not give him time ſo much as to ſpeak, but ſhot him dead: After which they took
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:047415_0030_1023A2BB48CDA980"/>
his body, disfigured as it was with its blood, out of the chaiſe, opened the ſtomach, plucked out his heart and put it into a box<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for the body they interred in the middle of the wood, and far from the road, as they had been ordered, left, if it had been found with the heart taken out of it, a ſuſpicion might have ariſen that the murder had not been committed by common highwaymen.</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro having waited a day for his valet-de-chambre, ſent away meſſengers to learn what was become of him. Having met with the lacky, who as above-mentioned, rode off upon the at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tack of the chaiſe, they brought him to Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro, and it was by his intelligence that he knew of the aſſaſſination of the poſtilion and valet de-chambre. He imagined that thoſe who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the murder were highwaymen; and after having laid an account of what had happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Magiſtrates, he thought it his beſt way not to ſtay longer, his preſence for proſecution for the murder being not neceſſary.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time that Don Ramiro was travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Paris, the ruffians who had aſſaſſinated his valet de-chambre ſteered their courſe towards the eſtate of the Count de St. Eſtevan, to whom they carried the heart, for which he was exceedingly impatient: for the murder of his rival was but a ſaint ſketch of the horrid projects which he had formed; his raging jealouſy having put him upon deſigns, attended with the more barbarity and cruelty than that of the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:047415_0031_1023A2BCD51A30F0"/>
The Count's joy was beyond all meaſure, when he thought himſelf rid of his rival. All that vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him was, that the aſſaſſins had not told Don Ramiro, before they murdered him, that they did it by his order; for he thought his revenge was not compleat, becauſe his enemy did not know who ſtruck him. He reproached the aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins for it more than once, and ſaid they had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their commiſſion by halves. As the other crimes. which he had contrived, were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in his view, he reſolved to take meaſures, that they might not be defective in the matter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>The cook having had time to reflect on what the Count had ſaid, believed that the heart was not poiſoned.

The waiting wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man promiſed her miſtreſs to ſatisfy her in every thing that the requeſted; but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> notwithſtanding her promiſe, ſent private information to the Marquis de Mendoſa of his daughter's wound, of Don Ramiro's being aſſaſſinated, and of the cruel ragoo. The Marquis, at the receipt of this intelligence, was extremely afflicted: Yet ſtate policy which influenced all his actions, was his guide alſo upon this occaſion. He was ſenſible that by revealing the Count de St. Eſtevan's crimes, which were hitherto known only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Iſabella's waiting woman, he ſhould ſtain his own character. The ignomenious death of his ſon in law would be a diſgrace to him and all his family; therefore he reſolved to complain only of what was already public. He acquainted the King of the wound his daughter had received,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:047415_0037_1023A2CD7A19B7E0"/>
and of her huſband's rage; and, like a crafty Courtier, took this occaſion to magnify the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he had paid to the orders of his ſovereign, and improving thoſe ſufferings which ſeemed the moſt cruel, to pave the way of his preferment. The King was affected by Iſabella's misfortunes, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her father to ſend for her back to Madrid, and diſpatched an order that ſhe might be brought thither by twenty dragoons, who were ſent to fetch her from the country.</p>
            <p>While theſe things paſſed at Madrid, the Count de St. Eſtevan was actually ſet out for Liſbon. He did not imagine that Iſabella was ſo generous as to conceal the aſſaſſination of Don Ramiro; and therefore ordered three of his ſervants, of whom the cook was one, to be ready to let forward in the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>k of the evening.</p>
            <p>Iſabella continued three or four days longer in ſuch a low ſtate of ſpirits as hindered her from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible of all her misfortunes. In proportion as the began to recover her ſpirits, and to give more hopes of life, her ſorrows gathered ſtrength: The death of Don Ramiro appeared freſher in her imagination. She reſolved, however, to bear up againſt her ſorrow, though ſhe could not conquer it: And, when the guard above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was come for her ſhe was in a condition to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the fatigue at of the journey. She would have been glad to have been excuſed going to Madrid; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:047415_0038_1023A2D3BA7EBF28"/>
the reſt of her days. When ſhe was arrived there, ſhe acquainted her father of her reſolution, and begged him not to oppoſe it, becauſe ſhe was firmly reſolved to quit the world forever.</p>
            <p>While Iſabella was edifying all the Nuns by her behaviour, Don Ramiro heard at Paris that his miſtreſs was retired to a Convent, as well as how ſhe came to be ſeparated from her huſband. On the other hand, the Count de St. Eſtevan, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made it his buſineſs to enquire what was the talk at Madrid about Don Ramiro, diſcovered that he was not dead. The Marquis de Mendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa was alſo undeceived; and, ſeveral perſons hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received letters from Don Ramiro at Paris, giving an account of the aſſaſſination of his valet-de-chambre, the Marquis de Mendoſa was let in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the real truth of this affair. He reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ved to ſet out himſelf to convince his daughter how ſhe had been impoſed on, and to tell her news which he was ſure muſt be very grateful to her. While he was preparing to ſet out, two other perſons ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame courſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Don Ramiro and the Count de St. Eſtevan. Don Ramiro let out from Paris three days after he came to it; for, as ſoon as he was informed of Iſabella's retreat to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, he thought fit to haſten thither, in order to defend her againſt the attacks of her tyrant. On the other hand, the Count, being no longer apprehenſive of any proſecution for the aſſaſſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Don Ramiro, quitted Liſbon, and ſet out for the abbey to which he was informed his wife had retired. His deſign was either to poiſon or ſtab her; for his rage and jealouſy were doubled after he ſaw Iſabella out of his power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:047415_0039_1023A2D6CBA56260"/>
Don Ramiro came firſt to the place which Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella had choſen for her retreat. Alighting from his chaiſe, he haſtened to the Abbey, an gave notice that he was come to communicate ſome things of the laſt importance to the Counteſs de St. Eſtevan. The Nuns gave Don Ramiro ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the hall without the convent. Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella came thither ſome moments after Don Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miro. As ſoon as ſhe perceived him, ſhe gave a terrible ſhriek, and fell into a ſwoon with the fright. Don Ramiro, not knowing the reaſon of Iſabella's fainting away, and aſcribing it pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her affection, approached her, and taking her by the hand, ſaid to her, with a voice which was broken with tears and ſighs: "If I had thought, Madam, that my unexpected preſence would have brought the tragical ideas of your misfortunes ſo freſh to your remembrance, I would have been more cautions how I made my firſt appearance to you." Iſabella made no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer but fixed her eyes on Don Ramiro; and not withſtanding the fright ſhe was in, and her prepoſſeſſion that ſhe ſaw and heard a ghoſt, the image of her lover engaged all her attention. She durſt not anſwer, but ſhe heard and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: The force of her love, however, diminiſhed that of her fear.</p>
            <p>Don Ramiro, being ſurpriſed to find Iſabella ſo aſtoniſhed, and diſcovering ſomething in her countenance which betrayed fear, ſaid to her, looking tenderly on her at the ſame time: "What, fair Iſabella, has time changed your
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:047415_0040_1023A2D853746090"/>
heart? Am I hateful or indifferent to you? What is become of that love which you was to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for me, even beyond the grave? Ah! how different has my heart been form your's! nothing has been capable of changing my ſentiments. They are ſtill the ſame. They are as tender as ever."</p>
            <p>Fear is like the other paſſions: the ſecond im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of it are not ſo violent as the firſt; and a very little ſpace of time wears off the force of it. Iſabella ventured to look upon her lover's image. She afterwards heard him, and had the courage even to attempt to anſwer him; for, at the firſt effort ſhe made to ſpeak, her tongue faltered two or three times, but at laſt it formed diſtinct founds. "Oh! Don Ramiro, ſaid ſhe, is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for you to love me ſo well as to return from the other world to give me proofs of it! Since the dead know the ſtate of the living, you cannot be ignorant of the tears which I have ſhed for the loſs of you, and the tenderneſs with which I have ever remembered you. Notwithſtanding the fright which you have put me in, I conſider this moment that I now ſee you again as the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of all my life."</p>
            <p>No words could expreſs Don Ramiro's aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment. He knew not what to think of Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's diſcourſe. He was almoſt inclined to think that her ſenſes were impaired. "I am not dead, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he, fair Iſabella; I live, and live only to adore you." Iſabella ſurpriſed at Don Ramiro's lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. "You are really alive then, ſaid ſhe, looking tenderly on him, and my cruel huſband
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:047415_0041_1023A2D9DBF04090"/>
has not committed all the foul crimes which he related to me with as much aſſurance as cruelty. Oh! dear Ramiro! how many tears have you coſt me, and how do I delight to ſee you again? You would gueſs how great my joy muſt be, if you could but know the meaſure of my paſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row." She then gave him an account of her huſband's barbarity. Don Ramiro quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that his life was only owing to the miſtake of thoſe ruffians who had murdered his valet de chambre, and ſo great was his rage againſt the Count de St. Eſtevan, that he reſolved to go to Liſbon and fight a duel with him: nor was he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven maſter enough of his temper to conceal his purpoſe from Iſabella. No, ſaid Iſabella, if you have any love for me, I forbid you to fight a duel with my huſband. If I am really dear to you, of which I make no manner of doubt, do not give me reaſon to complain of you. Do not ſtain my honour by a combat, wherein it will be thought that I was concerned. The tears which dropt from Iſabella's eyes, while ſhe was ſpeaking to Don Ramiro, melted him. The fury which worked in his ſoul with ſuch violence was ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a warm tenderneſs. When he came to himſelf, he was afraid to add to the ſorrows of his dear miſtreſs, and feigned a compliance with every thing ſhe deſired. There are certain cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſuch as was this of Don Ramiro, wherein diſſimulation becomes neceſſary to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

to keep, ſaid to him, "I muſt alſo deſire another favor of you; which is that you will ſet out from this abbey with all the ſpeed you can, as your preſence cannot but be injurious to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Farewell, dear Ramiro, it is time that I take myſelf from you. I think my afflictions infinitely the lighter, ſince you are alive. At theſe words Iſabella, with tears in her eyes, went out of the parlour. Don Ramiro had not ſtrength to make anſwer, but he followed her to the gate, took her by the hand, watered it with tears as he kiſſed it, and, when he was alone, ſtepped ſome moments longer, quite oppreſſed with grief, and without ſeeming to remember the purpoſe he had contrived. But his deſire of puniſhing the Count de St. Eſtevan, quickly raged in him with more violence than before. He was no ſooner returned to his quarters, but he ordered his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to get the horſes ready, and ſet out for Liſbon. He had already travelled ſix poſt miles, when he heard the firing of piſtols, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of a wood not far off, through which the great road led. He thought he heard the cry of perſons attacked, and puſhed on to the place from whence the noiſe came. He preſently diſcovered three perſons ſtoutly deſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ding themſelves againſt ſix others, who ſurrounded and preſſed on them from every ſide. Don Ramiro thought himſelf obliged to aſſiſt perſons that were attacked with ſuch odds, and alighted therefore from his chaiſe. He was very well ſeconded by his two domeſtics; ſo that one of the highwaymen fell immediately by the point of his ſword, run in at his ſtomach,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:047415_0043_1023A2E253199A48"/>
another died ſoon after of the wounds he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and the other four ſeeing the fate of their comrades, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed.</p>
            <p>In the heat of the ſkirmiſh, Don Ramiro took no obſervation of the phyſiog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>y of the perſons whom he had aſſiſted. How great therefore was his ſurpriſe, when, drawing near to the perſon who ſeemed to be the maſter of the others, and who was ſo dangerouſly wounded that he could not ſtand, but was forced to lean againſt a tree, he found it was the Count de St. Eſtevan. His aſtoniſhment was ſo great that he ſtared at him without ſaying one word: The languiſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he found him in ſuſpended his animoſity.—The Count perceiving on his part that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector was Don Ramiro, ſeemed almoſt as much ſurpriſed as he, and much more confounded.—Though he perceived he had not many minutes to live, his jealouſy revived; ſo that he could not diſpoſſeſs himſelf of a notion that his rival had been to ſee Iſabella; and he was poſitive in his mind that ſhe only retired to the abbey, that ſhe might have the more freedom to converſe with him. Rage and fury intirely engroſſed his ſoul and he was reſolved to fill up the meaſure of all his iniquities; but he diſſembled, and concealed his wrath to render the effects of it the more fatal. "I perceive, ſaid he to Don Ramiro, that it was the will of Heaven that I ſhould be reconciled to you before I died, and that I ſhould with my own hand reſtore a felicity to you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

nevertheleſs to engage me to gratitude. I have not many more moments to live; permit me to make you the bearer of my laſt will to Iſabella. I have a right to require it of her; I wiſh that ſhe would give herſelf to you in marriage. My ſervants will tell her, and her father too, of the ſervice you have done me: They will be witneſſes that I die in friendſhip with you. I deſire you to forget what is paſt: I reſign my breath; be ſo good as to let me die in your arms, that I may expire with the ſatisfaction, at leaſt, of being perſuaded that you have pardoned me." Don Ramiro, ſeeing his enemy giving up the ghoſt, and touched with a remorſe for the misfortunes he had brought upon Iſabella, was ſo generous as to forget the injuries he had done to himſelf. I forgive you every thing, ſaid he to the Count, embracing him at the ſame time, and my heart is not"—Don Ramiro ſaid no more, but cried out; for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

up, to the neareſt town, which was that wherein the abbey was ſituate. As ſoon as Don Ramiro was come thither, he ſent one of the Count's ſervants to acquaint Iſabella of the ſad affair that had happened. Such was her abhorrence of the Count's action, that ſhe could not lament his death; but ſo great was her affliction to hear that Don Ramiro was dangerouſly wounded, that ſhe could not help going to ſee him. She was juſt departing out of the Convent, when ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that her father the Marquis de Mendoſa was arrived, and waited in the parlour to ſpeak with her. She ran to embrace him, and having acquainted him of her huſband's death, and of Don Ramiro's wound, the Marquis choſe to lead her himſelf to the man whom he commanded her to regard from that moment as her future ſpouſe.</p>

The hopes of being ſoon perfectly happy by the poſſeſſion of Iſabella, which the Marquis aſſured him of, contributed as much as the care of his doctors to his cure, which was compleated in a very little time, as was his marriage with his fair miſtreſs.</p>
