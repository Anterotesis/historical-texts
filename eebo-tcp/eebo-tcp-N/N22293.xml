            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE HISTORY OF CLARISSA HARLOWE.</head>
            <p>MISS Clariſſa Harlowe, the ſubject of this Hiſtory, was the youngeſt daughter of James Harlowe, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> and was adorned with great perſonal charms, and ſuch perfections, as rendered her the ſubject of general admiration. Her father was a gentleman of a rigorous, inflexible temper, and extremely tenacious of his authority as a huſband and a parent. Her mother was a lady of a mild and gentle diſpoſition; but too much over-ruled by her lordly huſband and imperious ſon, who left her little power
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029413_0004_0FE0F01E8B8FD6C0"/>
of exerting the fine qualities ſhe poſſeſſed. This ſon was of a proud untractable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgiving temper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his ſiſter Arabella great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſembled him in her diſpoſition, and as ſhe was not diſtinguiſhed either by her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or accompliſhments, it is no wonder that her ſiſter Clariſſa, who was univerſally belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould be the object of her ſecret jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy and diſlike: but ſhe had another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for her averſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her grandfather had left Miſs Clariſſa a handſome eſtate, with a very elegant building <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Dairy-houſe, and enjoined his ſons not to diſpute it with her. This eſtate, however, raiſed ill blood in the family; though the mild and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, humble and unambitious Clariſſa, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it to her father's management, which for a time prevented thoſe heart-burnings from breaking out, which her brother and after were unable to ſtifle.</p>
            <p>While Mr. James Harlowe, Clariſſa's broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was gone to Scotland, Lord M—inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their uncle, Mr. Anthony Harlowe, that Mr. Lovelace, his nephew, was deſirous of entering into an alliance with the family, and that gentleman, who was a gay young rake, was admitted to pay his reſpects to Miſs Arabella, while Clariſſa was from home at the Dairy-houſe. The next day Miſs Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella paid her a viſit, and let her know that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029413_0005_0FE0F024668BBCA0"/>
ſhe was highly pleaſed with this event; though ſhe lamented that he was wild, and fond of intrigues; but took notice that he was young, and a man of ſenſe. At the next viſit ſhe liked him ſtill better; but though he afterwards made her ſeveral oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, he avoided all particular declarations; a conduct which Miſs Bella attributed to baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and grew extremely fond of a mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, on his ſtill continuing ſilent on a ſubjec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> that lay near her heart, ſhe at length grew offended. Mr. Lovelace, who in every thing behaved with the utmoſt art, took the opportunity of his ſeeing her angry to urge his ſuit; when ſhe told him that ſhe had no inclination to change her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and was quite happy as ſhe was. This Mr. Lovelace reſolved to take for a final anſwer, and expreſſing great concern at her reſolution, took his leave, and never more renewed his ſuit. Mean while Miſs Bella, who was greatly diſappointed, made a virtue of neceſſity, and pretended to be extremely glad that ſhe had rejected him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lovelace, ſometime after returning into the country, paid a viſit to the family, profeſſing that he was very deſirous of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating a friendſhip with it, though he had been ſo unhappy as to be deprived of the hope of the wiſhed-for alliance; and the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029413_0006_0FE0F02A277735E0"/>
lovely and accompliſhed Clariſſa being now preſent, his attention was obſerved to be entirely fixed on her; and the next day Lord M—making a formal propoſal in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his nephew, Mr. Lovelace was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to continue his viſits; though Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa's father had received a letter from his ſon, wherein he charged Mr. Lovelace with groſs immoralities, which induced him to ſuſpend the declaration of his own mind till his ſon's return; on which account Clariſſa would give him no opportunity of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with her in private.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lovelace now became very intimate in the family, though Miſs Clariſſa never appeared to think his viſits paid more to her than to the reſt. Mean while a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man under the care of Mrs. Harlowe's broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-in-law, being ſoon to make the tour of Europe, and Mr. Lovelace, who had already made is, being able to give a good account of what was moſt neceſſary for a young trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller to obſerve, he was aſked to oblige them with a deſcription of each country and court he had viſited; to which he conſented, on condition Miſs Clariſſa would direct his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation was Mr. Lovelace with the family, when Mr. James Harlowe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Scotland, and being told of his
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029413_0007_0FE0F02F920236D8"/>
viſits, loudly expreſſed his diſapprobation. He had an inveterate hatred of Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, that had ariſen from their frequent quarrels at college, where that gentleman had ſometimes ridiculed the haughty airs he aſſumed; and as Mr. James Harlowe never forgave what he thought an injury, he read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily ſeized this opportunity of ſhewing his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. Miſs Bella joined her brother from very different motives: ſhe boaſted her having diſcarded Lovelace, for which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the praiſes of her brother; and when they could not avoid ſeeing him, their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior was cold and diſobliging, and ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated into rudeneſs. One day, on Mr. Lovelace's coming, young Mr. Harlowe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly aſked, what buſineſs he had with his ſiſter; on which the other ſaid haughtily, he would anſwer a gentleman any way; but wiſhed he would not aſſume ſuch high airs, as he was not at college. Both their hands were on their ſwords; but a gentleman in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing, the affair paſſed off for that time: but as Mr. Harlowe ſeized every opportunity to inſult Mr. Lovelace, they fought, and the former was wounded, and afterwards attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſlight fever; on which the whole family <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lamed out, laying all the blame on the innocent Clariſſa.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lovelace, who had generouſly given
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029413_0008_0FE0F03518855FD0"/>
the young gentleman his life, ſent three days ſucceſſively to inquire after his health, and on the fourth came to pay him a viſit, which was conſidered as an inſult upon the whole family; and the father, though lame with the gout, could hardly be reſtrained from meeting him ſword in hand; while the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging Clariſſa, terrified at this confuſion, fell into a ſwoon, and, on her recovery, was cruelly inſulted by her inſolent ſiſter. At length, Lovelace hearing of Clariſſa's illneſs, retired, vowing revenge.</p>
            <p>As Lord M—was leſs inclined to blame his nephew than to take his part, the whole family were afraid of him, and though they believed that Clariſſa correſponded with him, their regard for their own ſafety pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their forbidding her. Mr. James Harlowe ſoon recovered, when both he and his ſiſter, the one from deep-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ooted hatred, and the other from ſlighted love, deteſted the name of Lovelace; and reſolved to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all poſſibility of his entering into an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with the family, by having their ſiſter ſpeedily married. He propoſed ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, but ſhe rejected them all; and yet had ſuch influence over her father and uncles, who had hitherto ſhewn great affection for her, as to be permitted to have ſome will of her own: but being now teazed and treated
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029413_0009_0FE0F03A416FE3B0"/>
ill at home, ſhe intreated to be allowed to ſpend ſome time with Miſs Howe, her moſt dear and intimate friend, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the oppoſition of her brother, was granted.</p>
            <p>She had been abſent near a month on this moſt agreeable viſit, when, without the leaſt notice, the chariot was ſent to fetch her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> home; ſhe was greatly ſurpriſed, but immediately obeyed. On her return, her conſternation was encreaſed, at ſeeing, inſtead of the pleaſure with which ſhe uſed to be received, a ſtiff formality <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it on all their countenances; and at her being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of being in Lovelace's company, ſhe pleaded, that ſhe had never converſed with him alone, and that it did not become her to preſcribe who ſhould viſit Mrs. Howe. To this her father anſwered, that ſhe had been too much indulged, and had refuſed ſeveral gentlemen; but that it was now his turn, and he would be obeyed, and therefore inſiſted on her conſenting to marry Mr. Roger Solmes.</p>
            <p>This gentleman was deeply in love with her; but was poſſeſſed of no one good qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; yet was immenſely rich. Clariſſa's generous heart roſe againſt him, and ſhe loathed the wretch who was famed for his avarice and meanneſs. Her oppoſition to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029413_0010_0FE0F040282B8DD8"/>
this diſagreeable propoſal expoſed her to the moſt mortifying inſults from her brother and ſiſter, and the harſheſt treatment from her parents and uncles. She was neither permitted to go to church, nor to pay any viſit, nor to appear before her father and mother. Her maid, who loved her, was turned away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Betty Barnes, a p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of her ſiſter's, ſet over her. In ſhort, ſhe had no other conſolation, but her correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with Miſs Howe; for being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to feed ſome Bantam poultry in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n old wood-houſe, at the ſide of the garden, ſhe depoſited her letters under a brick in a hole in the wall, that opened into a narrow lane; whither her friend's ſervant came for letters, and depoſited his young lady's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in the ſame place.</p>
            <p>In this diſtreſs ſhe wrote ſeveral moving letters to her brother and ſiſter; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn received the moſt bitter taunts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, with ſevere reflections on her ſuppoſed fondneſs for Lovelace. She alſo wrote to her father and uncles; but they all remained inflexible. In vain ſhe urged her averſion to Solmes, who, though he had a ſiſter in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, propoſed to make over his whole eſtate to them, in caſe he died without iſſue by Clariſſa. Hence they alleged that her aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ought to yield to the aggrandizement
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029413_0011_0FE0F042AD758708"/>
of the family, and the commands of a father, who having made no doubt of her compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, had gone too far to recede; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe muſt and ſhould be Solmes's wife.</p>
            <p>While Clariſſa was involved in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, ſhe was dreadfully frighted by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den appearance of Mr. Lovelace, who had entered the wood-houſe in diſguiſe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his reſpectful behaviour in this lonely place ſoon diſſipated her fears: but ſhe was in terror left he ſhould be ſeen; ſhe therefore reproached him for the danger to which he expoſed her, and was haſtening from him, when, throwing himſelf at her feet, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her ſtay for a few moments, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that he had committed this raſhneſs only to avoid a greater; he being no longer able to bear the inſults he received from her family, while his forbearance would be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with no other effect, than his loſing her for ever, by her being obliged to marry the object of her averſion. She anſwered, that no conſideration ſhould induce her to marry Solmes, ſince ſhe could, with great ſincerity, declare for a ſingle life. Here, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting her, he expreſſed his concern that after ſo many inſtances of his tender and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious devotion—Clariſſa ſtopped him by aſking, Why he did not in plain words men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion her obligation to him for his unwiſhed.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029413_0012_0FE0F0493189C340"/>
for perſeverance, that ſet all her friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her? She muſt forgive him, he ſaid, for preſuming to hope for a greater ſhare in her favour, when ſo vile a reptile as Solmes was ſet up as his competitor; and that, if ſhe was driven to extremities, his family would be proud of giving her their protection. In ſhort, his behaviour increaſed her confidence in him; and ſhe was ſurprized to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that he ſeemed as well acquainted with the cruel treatment ſhe met with as herſelf.</p>
            <p>Soon after this ſhe received a very affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate letter from her mamma, in which were incloſed patterns of rich ſilks from London, for the choice of ſeveral ſuits ſhe was to have on her marriage with Mr. Solmes, with orders to come and ſhew her thoſe ſhe liked beſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but commanding her not to come into her father's or her preſence, if ſhe was ſtill reſolved to continue undutiful. Her averſion to Solmes made her look on the patterns with horror, and ſhe remained in her chamber, though reminded by Betty, (Miſs Bella's pert maid,) that her papa and mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma waited for in her father's ſtudy. In this perplexity ſhe ſent her intreaties to ſpeak to her mamma alone; but in return, received an angry letter from her father, that he would never ſee her more till ſhe was Mr. Solmes's wife.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:029413_0013_0FE0F04E6BFB3F30"/>
At this time her dear friend Miſs Howe warmly adviſed the reſumption of her eſtate; but Clariſſa, from a principle of duty, was averſed to any litigation with her father, even though by his barbarous treatment ſhe ſhould be reduced to want. Mr. Lovelace paid that young lady a viſit, in order to engage her intereſt with her friend: he complained of the repeated inſults he received from the Harlowes, and, with an air of fierceneſs, told Miſs Howe, that if Clariſſa <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> forced to give her hand to Solmes, he ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> the world, and the world's cenſures, ſince the menaces of the family and their triumph over him would warrant the utmoſt effects of his vengeance.</p>
            <p>Clariſſa had juſt received an account from Miſs Howe of this viſit, when her relations reſolved to force her to a compliance, by ſending her to a moated houſe belonging to her uncle Anthony, where ſhe was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>arbarous brother and ſiſter. On this reſolution ſhe wrote warm remonſtrances to her brother, and had the ſpirit to add, that ſhe ſhould think it hard to be compelled to go to any one's houſe, when ſhe had one of her own, to which ſhe might retire. Soon after this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſent, Miſs Bella came up in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

O ſpirit, cried ſhe, is it come to this at laſt? You want to be independent, do you? My papa has lived too long for you!—Clariſſa was going to ſpeak, when rudely putting her handkerchief to her mouth, You have done enough with your pen, ſhe continued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but your independent ſcheme will not be granted: prepare this moment, for to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row you go, depend upon it: 'tis determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, child, you muſt go to-morrow. Thus ſhe ran on, till Clariſſa, quite out of patience, cried, No more of your violence; talk in this manner to your ſervant; and let me tell you, I won't go to-morrow, except I am dragged away by violence. What, girl, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed Bella, not if your papa and mamma command you? That command ſhall come from their own mouths, returned Clariſſa, and not from yours; and ſay another word, let the conſequence be what it will, I will force myſelf into their preſence, and demand of them, what I have done to be thus treated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Come along, child—come along, meek one, cried Bella; you'll find both your deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed parents—I don't want to be led, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Clariſſa; and ſince I can plead your invitation, I will go. She was haſtening to the ſtairs, but Bella locked the door; on which ſhe returned and went into her cloſet.</p>
            <p>In the evening a letter was brought her
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029413_0015_0FE0F05707019440"/>
from her ſiſter, in which ſhe was told, that her mamma had begged her off till the next week, but ſhe had done her buſineſs with the family; for, thanks to her ſtubbornneſs, none would receive her but her uncle Anthony. Clariſſa ſent the copy of this epiſtle to her mother, with a ſhort one of her own, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> know if ſhe was thus uſed by hers or her father's order? ſince, if ſhe was, ſhe would ſubmit. In return, her mother wrote, that ſhe had ordered her ſiſter to moderate her zeal for their authority, and concluded with bidding her try to deſerve a more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able treatment. In ſhort, it was reſolved, that within three days ſhe ſhould go to her uncle Anthony's, which ſhe learned from an inſolent note written by her brother.</p>
            <p>Clariſſa was in this perplexed ſituation, when ſhe received a letter from Lovelace, in which he obſerved, that he had ſomething of the utmoſt importance to communicate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

She had no ſooner depoſited her letter, than her heart miſgiving her, ſhe went to take it away; but Lovelace had been ſo watchful, that it was already in his poſſeſſion.—This was Tueſday, and on Thurſday ſhe was to be carried to the moated-houſe, from which there appeared no poſſibility of eſcape. Finding that her relations were unanimouſly reſolved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Clariſſa, having obtained ſo much time, revoked her appointment with Lovelace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to write what he had to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. In his anſwer, he complained, in very high terms, of her breaking her promiſe, and now appeared rather the haughty than the humble lover. Clariſſa, in her reply, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her ſurpriſe at the freedom of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, and told him, that ſhe was ſo much alarmed at this treatment, that ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the laſt letter he had written might be

            <p>That unhappy lady, filled with the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of her being carried to her uncle's, now ſent Miſs Howe a ſmall parcel of linen, with all her papers; and that young lady promiſed to try to engage her mother to give her privately her protection. Two days after ſhe received another letter from Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, who expreſſed himſelf under mortal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions from Solmes's viſit, and even propoſed to fix her in a place of ſecurity, either with the ladies of his family, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe ſhould chooſe, and then leave her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at her own liberty, either to agree with her friends, or to approve or reject him, as his future conduct ſhould deſerve. But ſhe told him, in her anſwer, that ſhe had intended never more to write to a man who could reflect on her for making uſe of her own judgment, cenſuring him for his clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine proceedings, in order to come at the ſecrets of her family; obſerving, that her averſion for Solmes would not permit her to doubt her reſolution; though ſhe would not have him interpret this averſion in his own favour.</p>
            <p>The dreaded time of meeting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Solmes, who was richly dreſſed, approached her, cringing to the ground, with a viſible confuſion on every feature. After half a dozen ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aked-up hems, he began, He was very ſorry—it was his misfortune—it was his misfortune—and then he ſtopped. Clariſſa ſat down, turning her face from him, and fanning herſelf: on which he reſumed, It was his awe, his extreme reverence for ſo ſuperlative a lady, and he hoped ſhe would not deſpiſe him for ſuch true tokens of love. He then added, ſhe might have heard things to his diſadvantage; and if ſhe would men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them, he would either own his faults, or convince her that he was baſely belied. Clariſſa acknowledged that ſhe had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, as he was nothing to her, nor ever could be, it did not become her to concern herſelf about them. He returned, that he was very ſorry to hear it, but was ſure ſhe ſhould not tell him of a fault that he would not be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to correct.

Mr. Solmes now pauſed, and appeared ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolute; when her uncle Anthony coming in, immediately cried out, So, niece, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Clariſſa, on her uncle's entrance, roſe up, and humbly beſought his compaſſion. You, niece, he replied, will have every body's favour when you have learned to deſerve it. If I ever can deſerve it, ſhe cried, I certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerve it now: I will engage never to marry without my father's conſent, and yours, Sir, and every body's.

Her uncle now ſwore ſhe ſhould, in ſpite of all oppoſition, be Solmes's wife, within a week at fartheſt. On which ſhe replied, I am very ſorry, Sir, to ſee you out of temper, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

            <p>She was now going, when her brother bolted upon her, crying, Return, pretty Miſs. Your intriguing brother, ſhall redeem you! You ſhall be redeemed from ruin, by being married to this worthy gentleman, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after you will thank him for his condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Then ſeizing her hand, he pulled her to Mr Solmes, and endeavoued to join their hands; on which Clariſſa ſtrove to ſnatch hers from him. How now, Miſs Clary! he cried. And how now! ſhe returned; what right have you to diſpoſe of my hand? Let me go, Sir. You deſign, by your unmanly griping, to hurt me. But why am I treated thus by you?

As ſoon as ſhe could ſpeak, ſhe again addreſſed herſelf to Solmes, telling him, that if he had any regard either for her, or even his own happineſs, he would proſecute his addreſſes no farther. Can you think me, Sir, added ſhe, ſo poor a ſlave, as to change my mind from the violent uſage I meet with? And you, Sir, continued ſhe, turning to her broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if you think meekneſs always indicates tameneſs, and that there is no magnanimity without bluſter, for once own yourſelf miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken;

for you ſhall be convinced that a generous mind is not to be forced: and—No more I charge you, interrupted the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious brother; and then turning to his uncle, cried, See, Sir, your faultleſs niece, your dear favourite!</p>
            <p>By this time, the young lady was ready to faint, but nobody minded her: ſhe rang, and on Betty's coming in, ordered her to bring a glaſs of water; on which her broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cried to Solmes, Art, damned art! Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa, having drank the water, leaned on Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's arm, and was withdrawing, when her uncle let her know, that he had not yet done with her; on which ſhe promiſed to return as ſoon as ſhe had recovered her ſpirits, and was permitted to go into the garden. In about half an hour's time, ſhe was again or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into the parlour, where ſhe continued alone, till her uncle Anthony uſhered in Mr. Solmes. For God's ſake, Madam, cried the latter, folding his hands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

No more ſupplications, Sir, cried the uncle: this perverſe and fooliſh girl deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſes all I intended to do for her; I will therefore change my meaſures. Clariſſa, thanking him for his kind intentions, ſaid ſhe would cheerfully reſign all claim to any of his favours, except kind looks a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

At this inſtant, in burſt her meanly liſtening brother, in a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rage, calling her names. Was this, he aſked, he conſtructions of his care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for her?

            <p>At this inſtant Betty entered to deſire her young maſter to attend his father.

She ſhall not ſtay another hour under my roof. Upon this ſhe flew to the door, and on her knes begged for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, entreating her father not to caſt off his kneeling child.

While the lovely Clariſſa was thus agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by continual apprehenſions of her being united to a man for whom ſhe had the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt averſion, ſhe was informed by a letter from Miſs Howe that ſhe had tried in vain to perſuade her mamma to give her protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if ſhe was forced to leave her father's houſe. At the ſame time ſhe found by a letter from Lovelace, that he was acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the ſevere treatment ſhe met with, and his earneſt entreaties to accept of the protection of the ladies of his family. But while ſhe was heſitating how to act, ſhe was told that all ſhe feared from her uncle's chapel, would be performed in her own chamber. This news was confirmed by her aunt Harvey, who informed her that Mr. Lovelace's menaces occaſioned this haſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; and that the whole family were reſolved to have her married the following week: that her father himſelf would bring her the ſettlements for her to ſign: and as ſhe had complained of harſh uſage, he had reſolved on making uſe of all the mild and gentle arts of perſuaſion, to induce her to yield. But whether ſhe conſented with a good grace or not, it was abſolutely reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ſhe ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

—indeed I never will. All I ſhall ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Mrs. Harvey, is, that as Mr. Lovelace has reſolved to force you out of their hands, I can't help ſaying they art in the right, in reſolving not to be bullied out of their child. Clariſſa ſoon after ſent to deſire a week's reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite, when the anſwer was, did ſhe want to give the vileſt of men an opportunity to put his murderous ſchemes in execution?

            <p>Lovelace came at the appointed hour; but inſtead of liſtening to her reaſons, artfully drew her to the outſide of the garden door, beſeeching her to haſte to a chariot which waited for her.

She ſtruggled to get her hand from him, telling him ſhe would ſooner die than go; but he ſtill drew her further from the door. Whither, Mr. Lovelace, do you pull me? cried ſhe in anger: Do you ſeek to keep me till it is impoſſible for me to return? If you would have me think tolerably of you, let me go this moment.

Mr. Lovelace took leave of his lady, as he called Clariſſa, the next morning, but firſt preſſed her to accept of a bank note, which ſhe reſolutely refuſed; but he left it on the table. However, the next day he returned, pleading the ardour of his love, and his fear of her brother's projects. He now amuſed her with looking for a houſe, and told her he had fixed on one inhabited by Mrs. Fretchville, a widow lady, that would ſoon be empty. He, however, ſtill lodged in the houſe with Clariſſa, who was too much in his power to hinder him. His vanity made him now reſolve to ſhew her to four gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men his moſt intimate friends, for whom he provided an entertainment in the ſame houſe; but it was with the utmoſt difficulty that he and Mrs. Sinclair prevailed on Miſs Clariſſa to give them her company. Theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men became her great admirers, but their behaviour was far from being agreeable to Clariſſa, who, as ſoon as ſhe was able, retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to her own apartment.</p>
            <p>A few days after, the unhappy lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her cloaths; but her inexorable rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſent with them neither the money ſhe wrote <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

my brother's wit, who points out to me death and deſpair: I wiſh for the one, and am every now and then on the brink of the other. As ſhe had now her cloaths, Mr. Lovelace very importunately perſuaded her to let him and ſome of the young women of the houſe accompany her to public places; but this ſhe prudently refuſed.</p>
            <p>One day when Lovelace was abroad, ſhe was ſitting in the dining-room, looking <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Lovelace entered the room with an air of tranſport, claſping his arms about her as ſhe ſat, while ſhe haſtily put up the papers in her handkerchief. My dear life, he cried, I have thought on a lucky ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to haſten Mrs. Fretchville to quit the houſe. My friends will ſoon be with you, who will not permit you to ſuſpend my happy day. And that all your ſcruples may be granted, I will then conſent to ſtay here, while you reſide at your new houſe.

               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:029413_0038_0FE0F0D1B67E8408"/>
Clariſſa was at length informed by Miſs Howe, that all ſubmiſſion to her inexorable relations would be in vain, and that ſhe ought to marry Lovelace as ſoon as poſſible: but this was not now in her power; for though Lovelace, to amuſe her, ſometimes pleaded his paſſion, and in the ſtrongeſt terms reproached her for her indifference, yet whenever he preſſed her to name the happy day, he mentioned ſeveral, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing her time to ſpeak, raiſed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections for her, and changed the ſubject. Thus in one of theſe converſations he told her, that he hoped his uncle lord M—would be her father; to which ſhe replied, that the word father had a ſweet and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſound, and ſhe ſhould be glad to have a father that would own her; but inſtead of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> this indirect conſent, which was expreſſions in an engaging ſweetneſs, with which he found himſelf greatly affected, he repulſed the riſing tenderneſs, objecting, that his uncle being lame of the gout would ſcarcely permit him to enjoy the honour, and then turned the diſcourſe to ſettlements and writings, that would take up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Vexed at his indelicate delays, Clariſſa had ſome thoughts of eſcaping from him, though ſhe knew her relations would neither relieve nor own her. Theſe thoughts ſhe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:029413_0039_0FE0F0D60E92D9A8"/>
communicated to her friend, who endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to find her a convenient and ſecure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and at length informed her that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> had found one; but Lovelace's behaviour now gave her hopes, though theſe were of ſhort continuance.</p>
            <p>The artful Lovelace, at length, prevailed on her to allow him to attend her to a play; and during their abſence, ſeveral of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were directed to ſearch for Miſs Howe's letters. Theſe were found, and all were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily employed in tranſcribing the ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections that virtuous lady caſt on the cruel, baſe, and ungenerous conduct of Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; and the ſchemes ſhe had formed for Clariſſa's eſcape.

               </gap> Lovelace now formed projects of revenge, and reſolved to uſe every art to bring the lovely Clariſſa to live with him on his own terms. Hence his tenderneſs became mingled with a ſavage fierceneſs, which affrighted and alarmed her, Provoked by this ungenerous treatment, ſhe tore almoſt in two an anſwer ſhe had written
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:029413_0040_0FE0F0DBD0482EB0"/>
to ſome propoſals he had given her in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the marriage articles; an anſwer that in the ſtrongeſt manner equally ſhewed the nobleneſs and delicacy of her mind, her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and prudence, and her duty and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her relations. Finding that ſhe was deeply offended, Lovelace, in order to impoſe on her credulity, formed new ſtratagems, in which he was ſupported and aſſiſted by wretches taught to act the part he directed. The houſe he pretended to have taken had hitherto anſwered his purpoſe, as it had made Clariſſa contented to ſtay with Mrs. Sinclair, whom ſhe diſliked; and he now put an end to thoſe expectations, by preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the imaginary widow Fretchville was ſeized with the ſmall-pox. In order to gain upon the tender heart of Clariſſa, who ardently longed to be reconciled to her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, it was pretended that a reconciliation was ſet on foot by an old villain, who called himſelf Captain Tomlinſon. This fellow was directed to form a plauſible ſtory of his having lately purchaſed an eſtate in her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle's neighbourhood, with a view to ſpend the laſt years of his life in the enjoyment of peace and retirement, where having contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an intimate friendſhip with her uncle Mr. John Harlowe, he was informed of the whole unhappy affair, and told that overtures had
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:029413_0041_0FE0F0DE3A9EBE90"/>
been made for a reconciliation, and that her uncle, having calmly conſidered every thing that had paſſed, had reſolved, in caſe Clariſſa and Mr. Lovelace were actually married, to endeavour to procure a reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and her relations.</p>
            <p>Lovelace uſed the utmoſt art to prevail on her to own before this man that they were married; but in vain. She obſerved, that ſhe was ſenſible of her folly, in permitting the people of the family to remain in an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and as her appearing in that character <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his friends; and therefore the ſucceſs even of her deareſt hopes ſhould not again engage her to countenance his falſehoods. Upon this he altered his plan. The ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed captain appeared; and, by Lovelace's deſire, ſhe overheard the diſcourſe that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between them. In fine, ſhe was invited to breakfaſt with them; when, after a long converſation, in which he acted his part with ſuch art, as to impoſe on Clariſſa, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her eſteem, he took his leave; and on Mr. Lovelace's return from attending him to the outward door, ſhe met him with a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble complacency in her looks. You don't know, Mr. Lovelace, ſaid ſhe, how near my heart this long-hoped-for reconciliation is. You don't know, Sir, how much you have obliged me. How happy ſhall I be, when
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:029413_0042_0FE0F0E4CAC62208"/>
my heart is freed from the weight of a fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's curſe; when my dear, my excellent mamma ſhall once more fold me to her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent boſom!—when I ſhall again have uncles all ſtriving who ſhall ſhew moſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the poor outcaſt!—then no more an outcaſt—and you, Mr. Lovelace, to be the pleaſed ſpectator of all this, and to be welcomed into a family ſo dear to me!—what, though they ſhould be a little cold at firſt, when they come to know you better, and you, as I hope, are entered upon a new courſe, all will be warmer and warmer love on both ſides, till they will wonder, perhaps, how they came to be at enmity with you. Then applying her h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

His compunction was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but of ſhort continuance; for his pride, his averſion to marriage, and his hatred of her family, made him ſtifle the dictates of conſcience, and continue to purſue his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous projects. The pretended reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was carried on; but when all her doubts and fears were cleared up, he only attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gain upon her affections, and by taking
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:029413_0043_0FE0F0E9BB152EE0"/>
hold of the moſt favourable moments, to make way, by little freedoms, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the greateſt: and when in theſe encroaching ſteps, he boldly took ſuch liberties as ſhocked the delicacy of her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, a viſit or a letter from Captain Tomlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to inform her of the meaſures he and her uncle had taken to accompliſh this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, was contrived to remove her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and reſtore him to favour. The marriage ſettlements were in the mean time ingroſſed, a licenſe applied for, and every method was purſued that could prevent her harbouring the leaſt doubt of his intentions being honourable.

            <p>One evening he ſuffered her to leave him ſooner than uſual, on her promiſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire directly to reſt. But a little after two in the morning, the alarm of fire was given, by her maid running to the door, and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loudly at it, crying, Fire! fire! the houſe is on fire!—riſe, Madam, if you would not be burnt in your bed! The lady's door was inſtantly unbolted, unlocked, and

opened, when Lovelace flying to it, beheld the lovely Clariſſa leaning on the arm of Dorcas, trembling, and ready to faint: ſhe was dreſſed only in her under-petticoat, and her feet juſt ſlipped into her ſhoes.

Lovelace claſping her in his arms, cried, my deareſt life, fear nothing, the danger is over—the fire is got under—and turning to Dorcas, added, how could you thus alarm and frighten my angel?

            <p>Lovelace had no ſooner entered his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than recollecting the opportunity he had loſt, and repenting that he had let it ſlip, he haſted back with the hopes, that through the diſtreſs of her mind, ſhe had not yet faſtened the door, and was now fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to execute all his purpoſes, let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences be what they would. But the door was locked and bolted, and all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions could not prevail on her to open it, though he pretended he only wanted to ſay three words, which ſhe would think the moſt acceptable ſhe had ever heard him utter.</p>

            <p>Lovelace had no ſooner left the houſe than Dorcas came to Clariſſa, and urged her to take ſome refreſhment. That lady was in tears, and her eyes ſwelled with weeping; ſhe ſighed as if her heart would break, and refuſed either to eat or drink; but ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordered her to bring her three of four French rolls, a little butter, and a decanter of water; telling her, ſhe ſhould not want her attendance. Dorcas conſulted Mrs. Sin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clair about obeying her, who readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that ſhe ſhould, but that a bottle of Sherry ſhould be added. Clariſſa was ſo obliged by this cheerful compliance, that ſhe was prevailed to on to go and look at the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age done by the fire; when, the better to deceive them, ſhe ſeemed to be convinced it was no trick.</p>

            <p>Before he came, his ſervant told the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the houſe, that his lady was lately married to one of the fineſt gentlemen in the world; but he being naturally gay and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe was extremely jealous of him, and in this fit had eloped; and that ſhe had played his maſter ſuch tricks three or four times, but with all the virtue and innocence in the world; ſhe flying to an intimate friend of hers, who, though a young lady of honour, was too, indulg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Lovelace no ſooner arrived, than every body appeared ready to oblige him; and he acted the part of a tender huſband ſo well as to gain their pity. He told them, that ſhould his ſpouſe ſee him at a diſtance, he ſhould find it very difficult to get to the ſpeech of her, and therefore prevailed on the landlord to lend him a great coat; when buttoning the cape over his chin, he aſked for a little powder, and lightly ſhook the puff over his hat, ſlapping one ſide of it over his eyes; and then put on a pair of coarſe ſtirrup ſtockings, that gave his legs a gouty appearance. Being thus equipped, he left the publick-houſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He pretended to want lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for his old wife, who lay under a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of diſorders, and acted the gouty old man ſo naturally, that Mrs. Moore was deceived. He hobbled up ſtairs, and ſaw all the apartments, except Clariſſa's and at laſt, with ſome difficulty, was admitted into that, while ſhe retired into a cloſet. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, if poſſible, to make her come out, and pretending to be going, You con't agree as to any time. Mrs. Moore, ſaid he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

that I would incommode the lady, but I would tell my wife whenaboute. Clariſſa then broke ſilence: Pray, Mrs. Moore, ſaid ſhe, inform the gentleman, that I ſhall not ſtay above two or three days at moſt, by which time I expect to receive an anſwer to a letter I have written into the country; but rather than be your hindrance, I would take up with an apartment a pair of ſtairs higher. Not for the world—not for the world, young lady, cried he; as well as I love my wife, ſhe ſhould he in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

She inſtantly knew him, and giving three violent ſhrieks, ſunk down at his feet in a fit, before he could catch her in his arms.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Moore, obſerving ſuch a ſtrange al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in his perſon, features, voice and dreſs, cried out ſeveral times, Murder! help! which alarming the houſe, up ran two ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant-maids, and after them Lovelace's ſervant. Lovelace called for water and hartſhorn, and every one flew a different way; while Mrs. Moore ran out of one room into another, and up and down the apartment they were in, wringing her hands, without knowing what ſhe did. Then come running a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his ſiſter, brought in by the maid, who told them that ſhe had let in an old wretch, hobbling with the go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

elſe; and atleaſt, ſhe ſtirring, and beginning to utter the moſt bitter ſighs, he in the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt accents called upon her, as he kneeled by her, with his arm ſupporting her head, My Clariſſa, my angel, my deareſt life, look upon me—I am not angry with you!—My <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Lovelace then threw up the cloſet ſaſh for air, and left her to the care of the young gentlewoman who came in with her brother, whoſe name was Rawlins, and of Mrs. Moore who had by this time recovered from her ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p>On his retiring he made his ſervant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

judge in this cauſe; and, Sir, I beg you to oblige me with your abſence. On this Mr. Rawlins retired, and Lovelace perceiving that ſhe was beginning to recover, left the cloſet, left her ſeeing him too ſoon ſhould throw her into another fit.</p>
            <p>Clariſſa at laſt looking round her with great emotion cried, O hide me! hide me! Is he gone'—Sir, ſaid Miſs Rawlins, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, this is ſome ſurpriſing caſe; the lady cannot bear the ſight of you. What you have done to her is beſt known in your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but another ſuch fit would probably be her laſt. It would therefore be but kind in you to retire.—The dear creature, ſaid he, may well be concerned at ſeeing me. If you, Madam, had a huſband who loved you, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But ſhe is mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled! This is indeed her only fault; but it is the more inexcuſable, as I am the man of her choice, and have reaſon to believe ſhe has a greater affection for me, than all the men in the world. I have three times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready forgiven the dear creature—but this jealouſy—there's ſpice of that in it, and of ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The unhappy Clariſſa no ſooner recovered her ſenſes, than ſhe burſt into the bittereſt complaints, that ſhe was ruined and undone, and earneſtly intreated them to aſſiſt her to eſcape the dreadful evils in which ſhe ſhould otherwiſe be involved. They preached pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to her, and perſuaded her to lie down; but ſhe refuſed and trembling ſo as to be unable to ſtand, ſeek into am eaſy chair. Lovelace now hoped that ſhe was ſo well recovered as to bear his preſence; but, on ſeeing him, ſhe redoubled her exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and beſought him to leave her. He anſwered in the tendereſt language, and told her, that he had a letter from Captain Tomlinſon; but uſed ſuch expreſſions as he knew would ſet her in ſuch a paſſion before the women, as might confirm the intimation he had given of her mind being diſordered. This artifice ſucceeded; ſhe exclaimed againſt his baſeneſs, and then burſting into tears, begged pardon of the woman for her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate exceſs.

Here they are—on which he pulled them out of his pocket, and offered them to her, with that of the Captain's; but ſhe held back her hand. Reflect, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, he continued, I beſeech you reflect upon the fatal conſequences that may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this high reſentment. From my firſt knowing you, ſaid ſhe, I have been in a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of doubt and error; but I bleſs God, I am now out of your hands, and will tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act what relates to myſelf.

I can, I will, ſhe returned, and thus I anſwer them. Again, raiſing his voice, he overbore her words; but when he found her ſilent, ſoftened his accent, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to ſee Captain Tomlinſon with temper, begging that for the peace of her own mind, ſhe would not fruſtrate the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's negociations. She was going to ſpeak, when he proceeded in a ſtrong and ſolemn voice, If we are to be ſeparate for ever, this iſland ſhall not long be troubled with me. Mean while, only be pleaſed to give theſe letters a peruſal, and conſider what is to be ſaid to your uncle's friend, and what you would have him ſay to your uncle. Then putting the letters into her lap, he, with a low bow, retired into the next room, and was ſoon followed by Miſs Rawlins and Mrs. Moore.</p>
            <p>Lovelace, on being joined by theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, endeavoured to engage them in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, by giving them the hiſtory of his own

and Clariſſa's family; her extraordinary averſion for Mr. Solmes, and putting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under his protection. He ſaid, they had been privately married, though ſhe had made him ſwear to keep ſeparate beds, and that ſhe obliged him to comply, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail on him to become reconciled to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. As Miſs Howe had detected the bawd, to whoſe houſe he had carried Clariſſa, and might ſtill find ſome way to acquaint that lady with her diſcoveries, he thought proper to prepoſſeſs them in favor of Mrs. Sinclair, and her two pretended nieces, by repreſenting them as very good people, and to paint Miſs Howe as a perfect virago, who had no equal in contriving and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting miſchief. He even told them the occaſion of their preſent difference; inſiſted on the reality of the fire, but acknowledged, that, having a huſband's right on his ſide, he would not have ſcrupled to break the ſtrange unnatural oath by which ſhe had bound him, on her being ſo accidentally frightened into his arms; and as ſhe thought fit to carry her reſentment ſo high, he blamed himſelf that he had not done it. He then read them a part of a copy of Captain Tomlinſon's letter, and afterwards put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands the copies of the two letters he pretended to have juſt received from his

            <p>In fine, Lovelace gained both Miſs Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins and the widow Moore over to his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and was even ſo ſucceſsful as to prevail on the latter to accept him for her boarder and lodger; but Clariſſa ſteadily refuſing to lie in the ſame houſe with him, he hired an apartment in the neighbourhood, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained leave for his ſervant to lie there, who had private orders to prevent Clariſſa's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a letter from Miſs Howe, or making her eſcape.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Moore and Miſs Rawlins, on their return to Clariſſa, pleaded with that lady in
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029413_0066_0FE0F16011F66768"/>
behalf of Mr. Lovelace; while ſhe, in the moſt diſtreſsful terms, beſought them to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour her eſcape. Lovelace, who overheard what was ſaid, and feared ſhe would remove the falſe impreſſions he had made on the minds of theſe ſober and modeſt women, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted their converſation; on which Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa complained of his intruſion, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he would ſay before that lady and Mrs. Moore, that they were really married; adding, Lay your hand on your heart, and anſwer me, Am I your wedded wife? Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, who would not have had the leaſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about aſſerting this, or even confirming it by the ſtrongeſt aſſeverations, could it have anſwered his purpoſe, was by this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thrown into confuſion, from his being well convinced, that, ſhould he aſſert ſuch a falſehood to her face, ſhe would never more believe any thing he could ſay. Hence he avoided giving her a direct anſwer; and though ſhe ſtill preſſed the queſtion, ſhe could obtain nothing from him but quibbles and prevarications: ſhe therefore reſolved inſtantly to leave the houſe: but he detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her by ſetting his back againſt the door, and then dropping on his knees, beſought her pardon, and intreated her to ſtay and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the viſit of Lady Betty and his couſin Montague, with the news brought by Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:029413_0067_0FE0F165A6EEA4F0"/>
Tomlinſon, of her uncle's having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with both their wiſhes. In vain were all her endeavours to eſcape from him: ſhe grew perfectly diſtreſſed, was ready to faint, and forced to lean againſt the wainſcot, as he kneeled at her feet. At laſt a ſtream of tears guſhing from her eyes, Good Heaven, ſaid ſhe, what will be my fate? Deliver me from this dangerous man!—I know not what I do, nor what I ought to do! Then turning from him, ſhe threw herſelf into a chair. He roſe, and approached her with reverence, crying, My deareſt life!—when, with a face glowing with conſcious dignity, ſhe interrupted him by crying, Ungenerous, ungrateful Lovelace! you know not the value of the heart you have inſulted! Nor can you imagine how much my ſoul deſpiſes your meanneſs: but meanneſs muſt ever be the portion of the vicious.</p>
            <p>The women, thinking they were now likely to be on better terms, retired, though ſhe warmly oppoſed their going. Lovelace then, bending his knee, begged her forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, promiſing to behave for the future with the moſt exact circumſpection; but ſhe could not truſt his promiſes, and refuſed either to dine with him, or to taſte any refreſhment.</p>
            <p>There dined with Mr. Lovelace and Mrs. Moore, a young widow, named Bevis, who
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029413_0068_0FE0F16BAFBCC788"/>
was very forward, extremely lively, and ſoon ſhewed herſelf a great admirer of Mr. Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. As ſhe was to ſtay a month with Mrs. Moore, who was her aunt, he took great pains to prevail on her to ſide with him againſt Clariſſa, and repreſented her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate friend Miſs Howe as the cauſe of all their miſunderſtandings. In the mean time, the pretended Captain Tomlinſon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, a converſation paſſed between them, which was ſo managed, as to make every one preſent believe that he was really married to Clariſſa, and that Miſs Howe, from her rage and jealouſy at his having ſlighted her, took every opportunity to widen the difference between them. Lovelace now obſerved, that he thought it high time to acquaint his ſpouſe that Captain Tomlinſon was arrived; on which Mrs. Moore went up, and deſired in his name that ſhe would permit him to ſee her; but ſhe begged to be excuſed, on account of her being very ill; when the pretended captain, profeſſing that he had much buſineſs on his hands, appeared great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vexed, and took his leave.</p>
            <p>The captain was but juſt gone, when Lovelace's ſervant brought him a letter from Miſs Howe, in anſwer to one ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Clariſſa, in which ſhe mentioned the agreeable news of her eſcape to Mrs.
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029413_0069_0FE0F16F9D302330"/>
Moore's, with an account of the low plot of firing the houſe to force her into Lovelace's arms, when ſhe had ſufficient proof of its being an infamous houſe, ſince, though ſhe heard the women in the next room, they took no notice of her cries. Lovelace's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, being ordered to intercept Miſs Howe's anſwer, had ſtopt the meſſenger, made him drunk, picked the letter out of his pocket, and carried it to his maſter, who finding means to read it without breaking the ſeal, the ſervant took it back, and put it again into the fellow's pocket, who ſoon after left the alehouſe, and mounting his horſe, gave it into Clariſſa's own hand. Miſs Howe, in this letter, congratulated her dear friend on her eſcape, and informed her of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a great deal of concern about a letter of the utmoſt importance, which ſhe had before ſent, and would not have had fall into the hands of that abandoned rake, Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, for the whole world. Clariſſa inſtantly applying to Mrs. Moore, told her that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he did not value the price, could a man and horſe be engaged to go for a letter left for her at one Mr. Wilſon's in Pall-Mall. On which a poor neighbour was ſent, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the ſame evening with the letter; but it was not the ſame ſent by Miſs Howe.
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:029413_0070_0FE0F175AD801DF8"/>
The important letter was that in which ſhe had laid open the plots of the treacherous Lovelace, and which he had in his poſſeſſion. He had copied thoſe parts of it that were moſt in his favour, omitting every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that might induce her to think Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair a bawd, and Tomlinſon an impoſtor; and, at the ſame time, had ſo artfully imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſs Howe's hand, that it was not eaſy to know the difference. The next day Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa wrote an anſwer, to let Miſs Howe know that ſhe had received her letter, but deferred giving a farther account of her affairs till ſhe had a more compoſed mind and leſs trembling fingers. This ſhe delivered to Mrs. Moore's maid, who being courted by Lovelace's ſervant, ſhe delivered it to him, to put into the poſt-office, and he carried it to his maſter, who immediately forged anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which he ſuppoſed was what ſhe would have written, had ſhe really received the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence ſent her by her deareſt friend.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Lovelace behaved to her with the utmoſt tenderneſs, pretending to be deeply concerned at his having offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. That ſpecious villain Tomlinſon was introduced, and ſeveral intereſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations paſſed between him, Lovelace, and Clariſſa, wherein no arguments were ſpared to engage her confidence, and baniſh every
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:029413_0071_0FE0F178722090B8"/>
apprehenſion of the deſigns he ſecretly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt her. In the mean time, the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of his heart and of his conſcience fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prompted him to endeavour to merit her favour, by laying aſide all his wicked plots; but his libertine principles prevailed, and his pride and revenge getting the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, he reſolved to humble her virtue, and, before he married her, to bring her down nearer to his own level. By his inſidious arts he again prevailed upon her to allow him her company, and to ſhew him ſome compaſſion for his well-diſſembled diſtreſs; but he could not engage her to come to any determination till ſhe had received another letter from her dear and only friend; and this he was determined to prevent, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which indeed he effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great difficulty. One day, after his having a very tender and affecting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with her alone, a meſſenger arrived from Miſs Howe with a letter, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on delivering into Miſs Clariſſa's own hand; but ſhe being gone to church with Mrs. Moore, Lovelace prevailed on Mrs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis to perſonate her, and reclining on a couch, with her face muffled up, ſhe received the letter, and delivered it to Lovelace, who now found freſh cauſe to rejoice that he had prevented her receiving it, for Miſs Howe
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:029413_0072_0FE0F1802734BE40"/>
here confirmed her of what ſhe had before written of the infamous houſe, and her rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for diſtruſting the ſpecious Tomlinſon; and, in ſhort, had laid a plan for her eſcape.</p>
            <p>Lovelace, now finding himſelf under a neceſſity of haſtening his deſigns, procured two genteel women of the town to perſonate Lady Betty and his couſin Montague, and having inſtructed them in their parts, had them brought to Mrs. Moore's in a hired coach and four, it being pretended that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Betty's was new lining and repairing. Both of them were richly dreſſed, and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with jewels, hired for this purpoſe; and being attended by ſervants nearly in the ſame livery as Lady Betty's, it was impoſſible for Clariſſa, who had never ſeen either of them, to ſuſpect their being other than what they appeared. The more theſe pretended ladies converſed with her, the more fond they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to grow; they loaded her with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes, cenſured Lovelace, and congratulated themſelves on the happineſs they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his being allied to her, could they prevail on her to forgive him. Clariſſa was far from having the vanity to believe all the flattering ſpeeches they made her; yet hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no ſuſpicion, ſhe was not diſpleaſed at ſo favourable a beginning of an acquaintance, with ladies of whom ſhe had always heard honourable mention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:029413_0073_0FE0F18411C41C68"/>
Mr. Lovelace treated his pretended aunt with great reſpect, and allowed her to have the advantage over him in the many lively repartees that paſſed between them; though Clariſſa eaſily perceived he purpoſely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore that ſmartneſs which he never ſpared ſhewing to Miſs Montague. The laſt-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned lady behaved with ſtill more reverence to her aunt; while ſhe kept up the dignity of the character ſhe aſſumed, rallying both, of them with the air of a perſon conſcious of the ſuperiority which her years and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune gave over thoſe who might be obliged to her either while living or at her death. The converſation, for ſome time, turned on their own family and the happineſs they ſhould receive on Clariſſa's admiſſion into it. They diſcourſed on Lady M—'s and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Sarah's earneſt deſire to ſee her; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friends and admirers ſhe would have among them, and the happineſs of Lovelace. They launched out in praiſe of Miſs Howe, and talked of a reconciliation and intimacy with all Clariſſa's friends, particularly with her mother; giving that lady all thoſe praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that were univerſally allowed to be her due; while Clariſſa, delighted with hearing ſo many agreeable things, almoſt forgot her reſentment againſt Lovelace.</p>

               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:029413_0074_0FE0F18AA10A9670"/>
As there were accommodations in the houſe for Lady Betty and Miſs Montague, it was agreed that they ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e there that night; but the Lady Betty recollecting that ſhe muſt go to town, ordered her coach to the door, telling Clariſſa that they would all go together, and that ſhe would leave her woman to ſet her apartment in order. All her objections were over ruled: ſhe was led to the coach, and Lady Betty ordered Mrs. Moore to get ſupper ready againſt their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. All the way nothing paſſed but the height of affectionate complaiſance. But what dreadful terrors ſeized Clariſſa's mind, when ſhe came within ſight of the odious houſe from which ſhe had made her eſcape! The coach ſtopped at the door, and Clariſſa cried out;—but Lovelace, begging ſhe would be under no apprehenſions, aſked if there were any letters for him. Dreadfully did Clariſſa's heart miſgive her; ſhe was ready to faint. O my life, ſaid Lovelace, why this terror? You ſhall not ſtir out of the coach. Your lady will faint, ſaid the vile Lady Betty, turning to him. My dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt niece, added ſhe, taking her hand, you are ſo ill, we muſt alight—let us alight only for a glaſs of water and hartſhorn—indeed we muſt alight. No, no, cried Clariſſa, no—I am well—quite well. Then putting
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029413_0075_0FE0F18F1EF04DA8"/>
her head out of the coach, ſhe called out, Man, drive on! drive on! Dorcas then came to the door. My deareſt creature, ſaid Lovelace, you ſhall not alight. Any letters for me, Dorcas? There are two, Sir, ſhe replied, and here is a gentleman waiting for your honour. I'll juſt ſpeak to him, he returned, open the door—you ſhan't ſtep out, my dear.—But we muſt ſtep out, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, ſaid his aunt, your lady will faint. Maid, a glaſs of hartſhorn and water! My dear, you muſt ſtep out—You'll faint, child—We muſt cut your laces—Indeed you muſt ſtep out, my dear. I know, ſaid Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, that ſhe will be well the moment the coach drives from the door. She ſhall not alight, by my ſoul ſhe ſhan't. Lord, Lord, nephew! Lord, couſin! cried both of the women in a breath, what ado you make about nothing! You perſuade the lady to be afraid of alighting. Don't you ſee ſhe is fainting? Indeed, Madam, ſaid he, my dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love muſt not be teazed to come out againſt her will. Fiddle faddle, fooliſh; what a pother is here! ſaid Lady Betty. I ſuppoſe you are aſhamed to let us ſee what ſort of people you carried your lady among. But do you go, take your letters, and ſpeak to your friend.

while the execrable Lady Betty inſiſted on their alighting, aſking her whom ſhe could be afraid of in her and her niece's company; obſerving that ſhe muſt have been treated there in a very ſhocking manner, and that ſhe was determined to inquire into it. The old creature, at this inſtant, came to the door, begging a thouſand pardons if ſhe had any way offended her, and entreating the other ladies to alight. In fine, a glaſs of hartſhorn and water, mixed with ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ingredients, were brought; the pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lady Betty obliged her to drink it up, and the poor unhappy Clariſſa, in ſpite of all her oppoſition, was prevailed on to alight, and on the promiſe of being detained only a few minutes, with faultering ſteps, and the utmoſt reluctance, entered the houſe. Tea was called for, and inſtantly brought, of which, diſliking the taſte, ſhe drank only two diſhes.</p>
            <p>The diſtreſſed Clariſſa was ill before, but ſhe now perceived herſelf more and more diſordered in her head; a heavy torpid pain increaſing faſt upon her, which ſhe then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted only to her terror. By the Lady Betty's perſuaſions, ſhe was induced to go up ſtairs, attended by Dorcas, to take ſuch of her cloaths as ſhe immediately wanted. She inſtantly ſet about it, ordering what

               </gap>he bad way Miſs Montague was in, and the dangers of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But ſhe would believe nothing he ſaid, unleſs he would immediately order a coach, and let her go in it to Hampſtead: She fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not robbers. He was all her fear, and that houſe her terror: Repeating, If you mean me honourably, let me leave this hated place.</p>
            <p>At this inſtant entered Mrs. Sinclair in a violent ferment, crying, Pray, Madam, what has this houſe done to you? And ſetting her huge arms a-kimbo, added, Hoh! Madam! let me tell you, I am aſtoniſhed at the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms you take with my character! The poor Clariſſa, to whom this woman had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways behaved with the moſt obſequious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:029413_0080_0FE0B7F7246D2260"/>
was frighted at her fierce look, and maſculine air. God help me! cried ſhe; what will become of me? Then turning her head in a wild kind of amazement, added, Whom have I for a protector? What will become of me now! My deareſt life, I will be your protector, he cried; but indeed you are uncharitably ſevere on poor Mrs. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair: She was born a gentlewoman, and would ſcorn to be guilty of a wilful baſeneſs. I hope ſo, ſaid ſhe—it may be ſo—I may be miſtaken; but there is no crime, I preſume, nor treaſon, in ſaying, I don't like her houſe. The old dragon again ſtalked up to her with her arms a-kimbo, while her erect and ſcouling eye-brows half hid her fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret eyes, and with two Hoh! Madams! ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted the frighted beauty, who was ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified that ſhe caught hold of Lovelace's ſleeve. He, fearing leſt ſhe ſhould fall into fits, told Mrs. Sinclair that thoſe apartments were his; and he could not conceive what ſhe meant either by liſtening to what paſſed between him and his ſpouſe, or by her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in unaſked, and giving herſelf thoſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent airs. At this, the old Beldam threw herſelf into a chair, and fell a blubbering. Mean while, the pacifying her, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to reconcile the lady to her, took up till near one o'clock. What followed was
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029413_0081_0FE0B7F0C43600C0"/>
the moſt vile and inhuman acts of violence. The diſtreſſed lady, rouſed from the dreadful lethargy into which ſhe was ſinking, pleaded for mercy, and cried, I will be yours—indeed, to obtain mercy, I will be yours! But no mercy could ſhe find. Her ſtrength, her intellects failed her. Fits upon fits fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, which procured her no compaſſion; and death was with-held from her, which ſhe would have received as the greateſt bleſſing.</p>
            <p>On the ſecond day after this vile and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid action, the abandoned Lovelace had a ſpecimen of what he might expect from the lady's reſentment, ſhould ſhe ever recover her ſenſes: For, following Dorcas into her apartment, and attempting to pacify-her, in the midſt of all his blandiſhments, ſhe in ſpeechleſs agony held up to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a licenſe he had procured and given her, and ſeemed about to call down vengeance upon him, when all her ſenſes were locked up in ſleep, before ſhe could get half through with her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended imprecation. The next day the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy lady fell into a contrary extreme, and became as much too lively as ſhe had been before too ſtupid; and, except in ſome lucid intervals, was raving mad.</p>
            <p>The barbarous Lovelace was ſhocked at the reflection of the villainy of the attempt,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029413_0082_0FE0B7FD1BD59470"/>
and the madneſs with which it was followed: And whenever he gave himſelf leave to think, was filled with remorſe: But the lovely Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa no ſooner began to recover her ſenſes, than liſtening to the ſolicitations of the abandoned Sinclair, he reſumed his project of breaking her ſpirit, ſo as to make her glad to live with him as his miſtreſs. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhe was coming to ſpeak to him, he grew pleaſed with the thought that he ſhould ſtare her into confuſion, and exulted in the advantage which the confidence of his ſex would give him over the baſhful modeſty of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. But ſhe no ſooner appeared, than the dignity of her air, the ſedate firmneſs of her countenance, and the ſuperiority of her mind, expreſſed in the awful language of injured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his whole frame, and gave him the faultering heſitation of a trembling criminal. His guilt, and her innocence, merit and rank, all ſtared him in the face, in ſo formidable a manner, that his preſent account to which ſhe now unexpectedly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, ſeemed to reſemble the general one to which we muſt all be ſummoned. In this ſolemn converſation ſhe boldly aſked him, what ſhe was farther to ſuffer from his bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, and whether ſhe was ſtill to be kept a priſoner? He was ſo confounded by the majeſtic compoſure, and the dignity of her
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029413_0083_0FE0B81445987AD8"/>
juſt reproaches, that he could only in broken incoherent ſentences ſtammer out an offer of making her amends by marriage. But doſt thou think, replied ſhe, that marriage will atone for a guilt like thine? Deſtitute as thou haſt made me, both of friends and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I too much deſpiſe the wretch who could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ob himſelf of his wife's virtue, ever more to endure the thought of marrying thee.</p>
            <p>In fine, ſeveral other affecting converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions paſſed between them, wherein ſhe bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claimed her right to be left to her own liberty to go where ſhe pleaſed; and indeed made ſeveral attempts to eſcape. But though, while in her preſence, he was awed by her virtues, yet he would not permit her to leave the houſe; and ſhe ſtill found herſelf a priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, ſurrounded by none but thoſe who were the objects of her deteſtation, and were ready to prompt and aſſiſt him in all his baſe deſigns. Often did he plead for pardon, and offer marriage; but all his ſolicitations were without effect, and ſhe told him, ſhe was firmly reſolved never to bind her ſoul in covenant to a man ſo nearly allied to perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>While the unhappy Clariſſa was in this diſtreſsful ſtate, and every hour in dread of ſuffering ſome freſh act of violence, ſhe fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:029413_0084_0FE0B8030DF21568"/>
ſhe obſerved ſome marks of compaſſion in Dorcas, who by Lovelace's order artfully inſinuated herſelf into her favour. Clariſſa, imagining her ſincere, thought this a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py opportunity of engaging her in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and gave her a note, in which ſhe promiſed her, on condition of procuring her eſcape, a valuable diamond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing, and an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of twenty pounds a year during life. From this circumſtance, Lovelace reſolved to terrify the friendleſs Clariſſa into a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his wiſhes; and therefore one night, ſoon after ſhe had retired to her chamber, he pretended to find this promiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry note, and inſtantly ringing the bell with the greateſt violence, the whole houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came in an uproar, and his ſervant <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>unning into the room, he bid him in a rage bring that to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d Dorcas. She inſtantly appeared before him, when drawing his ſword, he cried, Curſed, confounded, villainous brib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery! She ran up to her lady's door, ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſafety and protection, while two or three of the other women ran, crying, what's the matter! What's the matter! But Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa, inſtead of opening the door, drew another bolt. This abominable Dorcas! he exclaimed; call up her aunt: let her ſee what a traitoreſs ſhe has placed about me, and let her bring the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029413_0085_0FE0B7B7C1738178"/>
She has taken a bribe, a proviſion for life, to betray her truſt, baſely to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a quarrel between a man and his wife, and for ever deſtroy all hopes of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between us. At this Sinclair came up puffing and blowing, crying, as ſhe hoped for mercy, ſhe was not privy to it. Well might ſervants be at ſuch a paſs, when ſuch ladies as Mrs. Lovelace made no conſcience of corrupting them. For her part, ſhe did not deſire that he ſhould ſhew her the leaſt mercy. But where was the proof? The note was ſhewn; curſed then proceeded from every mouth, while all inveighed againſt the vileneſs of the corrupted, and the unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the corruptreſs. Dorcas was drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged along, whimpering between two women, both bawling out, You muſt come—you ſhall come and anſwer for yourſelf; you are a diſcredit to all worthy ſervants. She whining, I can't look ſo good and generous a gentleman in the face! Come along, cried Lovelace, it is detection, not the crime, that confounds you. Tell me, ungrateful devil, tell me, who made the firſt advances? Aye, diſgrace to my family! cried Sinclair, tell his honour—tell the truth; Who made the firſt advances? I have already betrayed one truſt, ſaid Dorcas—oh don't make
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029413_0086_0FE0B81A77A5BE28"/>
me betray another! my lady is a good lady! Oh don't let her ſuffer! Suppoſe, Sir, ſaid Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you have my lady and the wench brought face to face? You ſee ſhe does not care to confeſs. Oh my careleſſneſs! cried Dorcas! Don't let my poor lady ſuffer! Indeed if you all knew what I know, you would ſay her ladyſhip has been cruelly treated.—See, ſee, ſee, they all cried at once, only ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for being detected. Your lady won't, ſhe dare not come to ſave you, though it is more his honour's mercy, than your deſert, if he does not this inſtant cut your vile throat. Say, was it your lady, or was it you, creature, that made the firſt advances—If the lady had ſo much honour as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, bawled the vile Sinclair, ſhe will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to vindicate a poor ſervant, miſled by ſuch large promiſes! But, I hope, Sir, you will do them both juſtice—I hope you will.—Good lack! clapping her hands, to grant her every thing her heart could wiſh—to indulge her in her hatred to my poor innocent houſe—O Sir, I hope, if your lady will not come out, you will find a way to try this cauſe in her preſence. On ſuch an occaſion as this, I won't value my doors. Juſtice I ever loved. I hope you'll come to the bottom of it. I'll be ſworn I had no concern in this black affair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:029413_0087_0FE0F1AB17D351C8"/>
At this inſtant they heard the lady's door unlock and unbolt. The doors and window<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhutters where faſtened, and Will was placed below to prevent her eſcape, and that no noiſe or ſcreaming might be heard. But confiding in her innocence, Clariſſa entered the room with a majeſty in her perſon and manners that was natural to her, but then ſhone out in all its glory. Every tongue was ſilent; every eye awed. She walked up and down the room two or three times, before her indignation would permit her to ſpeak. But at laſt recovering her voice, O thou abandoned and contemptible Lovelace, cried ſhe, thinkeſt thou that I don't ſee through this poor villainous plot of thine, and theſe thine abandoned accomplices? Thou, woman, looking at the bawd, once my terror, always my diſlike, but now my deteſtation, ſhouldſt once more have robbed me of my ſenſes by intoxicating potions; then thou, wretch, added ſhe, turning again to Lovelace, mighteſt have ſecurely depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch a low, ſuch a wretched contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And yet, vile woman, who, perhaps, haſt been the ruin of the body and ſoul of hundreds, know that I am not married to this miſcreant, and that I have friends who will demand my honour at your hands: Take care then what farther inſults you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

You and I know, Madam.—We do ſo, ſaid ſhe, and I thank God I am not thine—once more I thank God for it! I have no doubt of the farther baſeneſs thou hadſt intended me, by this vile and low trick.

Say you will ſheath your knife in the injurer's, not the injured's heart; and then, and not till then, will I approach you. He moved a little forward; And doſt thou, doſt thou, added ſhe, with her arms extended, doſt thou ſtill inſidiouſly move towards me?

that diſtance; for it has ſaved a life; to what purpoſe reſerved, the Almighty only knows! To be happy, Madam, ſaid he, and to make happy—and O let me but hope for your favour to-morrow—I will put off my journey till then. And may God—Swear not, Sir, cried ſhe, with an awful and piercing look; you have too often ſwore! God's eye is upon us, his more immediate eye! and looked wildly. But the woman looked up to the cieling and trembled, as if afraid of the eye of God.</p>
            <p>If not to-morrow, Madam, ſaid he, ſay but next Thurſday!—ſay but next Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day! This I ſay, replied ſhe, and of this thou mayſt aſſure thyſelf, I never, never will be thine. And let me hope that I may be entitled to the performance of thy promiſe, to allow me to leave this innocent houſe, as one called it, as ſoon as the day breaks. Did my perdition depend upon it. Madam, replied he, you cannot, but upon terms: And I hope you will not terrify me.—Nothing leſs, ſhe returned, than an attempt upon my honour, ſhall make me deſparate. I have no views but to defend my honour: Solely with this view I entered into treaty with your infamous agent below. The reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution you have ſeen, God will give me

upon the ſame occaſion: but for a leſs, I wiſh not for it. Only take notice, woman, that I am not this man's wife; he has no authority over me. If you, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, detain me, look to it. Then taking one of the candles, ſhe turned from them, and, while Lovelace and the women ſtood ſtupidly gazing at each other, went away, not a ſoul being able to moleſt her. In a hurry ſhe pulled her key out of her pocket, unlocked her chamber door, and inſtantly entering her apartment, locked herſelf in.</p>
            <p>Early the next morning Lovelace ſet out for M—Hall, from whence he ſent ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral letters to Clariſſa, apologizing for the deſpicable figure he made in the laſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, and intreating her to render him hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py the next Thurſday. Four of theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were ſent by ſpecial meſſengers, who returned without an anſwer. He now wrote to Mr. Belford, one of his companions, and to the pretended Captain Tomlinſon, to pay her a viſit, and prevail on her to give her conſent. Mean while, Clariſſa's thoughts were employed on the means of her eſcape; and having given Mabell a brown luteſtring gown, while the mantua-maker was trying it on in another room, ſhe ſlipped over her own the one the girl had pulled off, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the wench's apron and ſhort cloak,

walked out of the houſe without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. No ſooner was ſhe gone than the whole houſe was in confuſion; but all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to find her were in vain. She had taken lodgings at Mr. Smith's, a glover, in King-ſtreet, Covent-garden, where ſhe had two rooms on the firſt floor; and, while ſhe was praiſing God for her happy eſcape, Lovelace was raving, curſing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Clariſſa inſtantly wrote to inform Miſs Howe of the loſs of her honour, and her eſcape; and alſo to Lady Betty Lawrence and Miſs Montague, to know whether they were at Hampſtead, and had brought her in a coach and four to town. Theſe ladies informed her, that they had not been at Hampſtead, and expreſſed their earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſee her happily married, as on that event they founded all their hopes of Mr. Lovelace's reformation: but Clariſſa, in her reply, told them of his villainous forgeries and perjuries; of his procuring two women, richly dreſſed, to perſonate them, who took her to a vile houſe, from which ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſcaped; where ſhe was firſt robbed of her ſenſes, and then of her honour; and concluded with obſerving, that nothing ſhould ever induce her to marry ſo treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and profligate a villain.</p>

The letter ſhe had ſent to Miſs Howe fell into the hands of that young lady's mother, who returned a very ſevere anſwer, which the ſtill unhappy Clariſſa received, while her mind was ſinking under the diſtreſſing tho'ts of the cruelty of relations, whom ſhe had nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ceaſed to love, and the dreadful idea of her father's curſe; but this giving a turn to her thoughts, helped to remove her deſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. At laſt ſhe received a letter from Miſs Howe; but it was only ſuch a one as aggravated her diſtreſs, and made her think ſhe had loſt her only friend. That lady re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on her for voluntarily returning to the wicked Sinclair's, after her informing her in two letters of the infamous character of the houſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Grieved and ſurpriſed at the contents of this letter, Clariſſa, in her reply, vindicated her own conduct from the charge of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſending back the long letter forged by Lovelace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then writing to Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, was informed that Mrs. Bevis, by Lovelace's deſire, had perſonated her, in

            <p>In the mean time, the Lady Betty Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and Miſs Montague went to Lord M—'s, and in that nobleman's preſence read to Lovelace the letters they had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the injured Clariſſa, and in very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere terms reproached him for his villainy.

            <p>Miſs Howe, influenced by their reaſons, preſſed her dear friend to marry him, as the only means of procuring her own happineſs. This letter ſhe ſent by the poſt, deſiring an immediate anſwer; but receiving none, ſhe wrote again to chide her for keeping her in ſuſpenſe, and ſent the letter by a meſſenger, who travelled all night, and carried it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Clariſſa, on being ſtopped by the officers, who whiſpered her, that they had a writ againſt her, and that ſhe muſt go with them, was terrified, trembled, and turned pale. They deſired her to ſtep into a chair, which ſtood with the head up to receive her. She for ſome time expoſtulated with them to know what they meant; but, at laſt, ſeeing Lovelace's ſervant, ſhe called out for help. A crowd inſtantly gathered round her, and while ſome were ſtruck with compaſſion at ſeeing a fine young creature in ſuch diſtreſs, others threw out ſhocking reflections. A gentleman now interpoſed, and aſking to ſee the fellow's authority, deſired, after he had looked at it, to know if her name was Clariſſa Harlow; and being told that it was, expreſſed his pity, and telling her ſhe muſt go with them, retired. Another gentleman inquiring if nobody could be applied to, who would ſee that ſhe was not ill uſed, Lovelace's ſervant anſwered, that orders were particularly given for that. She had rich relations, and would only be carried to the officer's houſe till her affairs could be made up.

Cover me, cover me up for ever! She was taken to the officer's houſe in a mean court in High Holborn; but, on her being taken out of the chair, fainted away. Sally, one of Mrs. Sinclair's nieces, was there, and, as a favour, propoſed her going to her former lodgings; but this ſhe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the diſtreſſed Clariſſa thus arreſted, than the execrable Sinclair diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a man and horſe with the joyful news to Lovelace, and the meſſenger was flattered with the hopes of his receiving a conſiderable reward; and therefore, as he found on his arrival that Lovelace was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a tour with Lord M—and his two nieces for two or three days, he ſtaid till his return; but, inſtead of a reward, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived nothing but curſes.

A ſhamed of the low villainy of this proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and diſtracted with rage, he inſtantly wrote to Mr. Belford, his moſt intimate friend; and ſending a meſſenger, as if on life and death, deſired him to haſten <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>This gentleman, who had often been an advocate for Clariſſa, and had frequently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſuade him to do her juſtice, inſtantly haſted to the vile Sinclair's, and not finding the lady there, poſted to the officers, but, as it was Sunday, could not obtain the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

However, the next morning, he was introduced into the room by the officer's wife, when he was immediately ſhocked at the dreadful place in which he found her, and its wretched furniture. She was kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a corner, near a diſmal broken win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſecured with iron bars, her arms croſſed upon a crazy table, and the fore finger of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:029413_0102_0FE0B8211C104F98"/>
her right hand in a Bible. Her dreſs was a neat white damaſk; her head-cloaths were a little diſcompoſed; her fine hair hanging in natural ringlets, but a little tangled, ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one ſide of her neck, as her rumpled handkerchief did the other; and her face, yet lovely, amidſt all her ſufferings, reſted on her arms.</p>
            <p>While Mr. Belford took a view of the room, and the kneeling lady in her white flowing dreſs, he thought his concern would have choaked him; and ſtammering out a curſe at the officer and his wife, aſked if that was an apartment for ſuch a lady? They replied, in excuſe, that they had offered her their own bed-chamber, but ſhe refuſed it. The charming ſufferer then raiſing her love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly face, overſpread with the moſt ſignificant woe, waved her hand towards the door, as if deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Mr. Belford did not dare to approach her, but on his knee entreated her to allow him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> from that wretched houſe, and out of the power of the vile woman who had cauſed her to be brought there: when once more lifting up her face, ſhe ſaid, Sir, are not you Mr. Belford? I think your name is Belford. It is, Madam, he returned; I
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:029413_0103_0FE0F28310AB22B8"/>
was always an admirer of your virtues, and am come to releaſe you from the hands you are in. And into whoſe to place me? cried ſhe. Leave me! leave me! Let me never riſe from this ſpot! Let me never, never more believe in man! This moment, deareſt Madam, ſaid he, this very moment, if you pleaſe, you may depart whitherſoever you think fit; you are abſolutely free, and your own miſtreſs. I had now, ſhe returned, as lieve die here as any where, and will owe no obligation to the friend of him in whoſe company you have ſeen me; therefore, pray Sir, leave me. Then turning to the officer, ſhe ſaid, that ſhe was better reconciled to his houſe than at firſt, and if he could but engage that none but his wife ſhould come near her, ſhe ſhould die with him, and they ſhould be well ſatisfied for their trouble; and then turning to Mr. Belford, again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to leave her, repeating, ſhe would owe no obligation to the friend of her deſtroyer; but offering to riſe, ſhe, through weakneſs, ſunk down and fainted away.</p>
            <p>Mr. Belford and the officer retiring, left her to the care of the woman of the houſe and her maid; and after her recovery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed ſhe was ſo weak and low that ſhe could hardly ſpeak, Mr. Belford took

this opportunity to go to her lodgings, in order to fetch Mrs. Smith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſhe being from home, he told her huſband what had happened, which he pretended was owing to a miſtake of orders; and finding that two letters had been left for her, he called a chair, and haſted back with them.</p>
            <p>On his return, an apothecary who had been ſent for, had juſt gone up ſtairs; and the officer's wife being above with him, Mr. Belford made no ſcruple of following them. The unhappy lady was ſeated on the ſide of a broken couch, and did not care to ſpeak to the apothecary, who made a very diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance. On her ſeeing Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, ſhe ſaid, her not being left to her own ſex was not the leaſt of her preſent misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. He begged her excuſe, and making a ſign to the apothecary to withdraw, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that he had been at her new lodgings to get every thing ready for her reception. That Mr. Smith and his wife had been ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of apprehenſions for her ſafety, and that he had brought two letters, which had been left there for her. Thoſe, ſhe ſaid, were from the only friend ſhe had in the world; when kiſſing them, and looking at the ſeals, ſhe put them in her boſom. He again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated her to think of quitting that wretched place, aſſuring her, in the ſolemneſt manner,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:029413_0105_0FE0F288E2610298"/>
that nobody ſhould diſturb her at Mr. Smith's; and that he would particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his honour, that he who had moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her, ſhould not come near her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her own conſent. Your honour, Sir! ſaid ſhe, are you not that man's friend? I am not a friend, Madam, returned he, to his vile actions to the moſt excellent of women. Do you flatter me, Sir? ſaid ſhe. O Sir, your friend, your barbarous friend, what has he to anſwer for! Her heart was too full to proceed; and putting her hand over her eyes, he ſaw the tears trickle through her fingers. He then mentioned Lovelace's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of this baſe outrage, and told her, that he was reſolved not to moleſt her; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching her to give directions about ſending her apparel to her new lodgings. Clariſſa then immediately gave him her keys, aſking if Mrs. Smith might not attend him; to which he having readily aſſented, ſhe agreed to go in the chair he had brought.</p>
            <p>Mr. Belford then left the room, and took that opportunity to make a ſmall preſent to the officer and his maid; and ſending for the apothecary, he paid him beyond his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>As Clariſſa had not been undreſſed during her confinement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe, on her arrival at Mr. Smith's, went to bed, and ſoon after, Mr. Belford, taking Mrs. Smith with him to the abandoned Sinclair's, ſaw every thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Clariſſa was next day ſo ill, that Mrs. Smith provided for her a very good nurſe; and ſhe had alſo the voluntary attendance of Mrs. Lovick, a decayed widow gentlewoman of great piety, who lodged over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

On the firſt viſit Mr. Belford was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to pay her, he vindicated Lovelace from having any hand in the ſhameful arreſt; but ſhe would not allow him to uſe any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to engage her to be his, or even to ſee him. The whole of this gentleman's conduct was, however, ſo unexceptionable, that ſhe could not refuſe his viſits; and her converſation had ſo happy an effect on his mind, as made him deteſt himſelf for his former vices, and reſolved, for the future, to regulate his conduct, as much as poſſible, by the unerring ſtandard of virtue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

In this melancholy ſituation, deprived of the comfort and aſſiſtance of her relations, ſhe found conſolation in the tenderneſs of the worthy Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith, which ſhe termed maternal; and in the affectionate viſits both of her doctor and apothecary, who being in years, and having children of their own grown up, behaved to her with an affection which ſhe was pleaſed to call pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.

Clariſſa's relations being, in the mean time, willing to know her manner of life, and, if ſhe was really ſo ill as ſhe pretended, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned a pragmatical young pedant, who had juſt taken orders, and was going to London, to make proper inquiries; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of which was, that, though ſhe was very ill, ſhe was viſited by one of Mr. Lovelace's intimate friends, and often went out in a chair, as it was ſaid, to hear morning prayers; but he had been told, that nothing was more common than to make the hearing of morning prayers a cover for private aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Having collected this conjectural ſcandal, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent it down to her relations; and ſuch was the ſpirit by which they were governed, that they readily believed the worſt inſinuation, and it was agreed to ſend her out of the reach of both Lovelace and Belford. Her ſiſter was therefore directed to write to Clariſſa, to propoſe her taking a voyage to one of the colonies.</p>
            <p>About this time arrived Colonel Morden, the truſtee for her grandfather's eſtate, who was received by the family with great marks of reſpect; but having a ſincere regard for Clariſſa, whom he had not ſeen for ſome years, he reſolved to take his own m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

With this view he rode to M—hall, where he had a very warm conteſt with Lord M—and Lovelace; but after ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſallies of paſſion, they grew more calm and compoſed, and Lovelace doing juſtice to Clariſſa's merit, and very freely cenſuring his own conduct, while he concealed the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inſtance of his villainy, and profeſſing his ardent deſire to make her all the reparation in his power by marrying her, as ſoon as ſhe ſhould permit him that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>This gentleman now wrote a very affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing letter to Clariſſa, to prevail on her to accept of Lovelace; to comfort her under her preſent illneſs; and to inform her that he would be her conſtant friend; and was then exerting all his endeavours to produce a happy reconciliation between her and her relations; which, as ſoon as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Colonel being now firmly convinced of his niece's innocence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent a perſon of diſcretion to inquire into the manner in which ſhe was ſupported, and the ſtate of her health. This meſſenger filled him with the greateſt concern and aſtoniſhment; for he found that ſhe was reduced to the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſelling her cloaths for ſupport; that ſhe was very ill, and that her piety and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation rendered her the admiration of all who were admitted to converſe with her. He then paid a viſit to Miſs Howe, who ſhewed him ſeveral of Clariſſa's letters, by which it evidently appeared that ſhe was extremely ill; and he rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Mr. Morden having tranſcribed theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, he the next day procured a general meeting with all the family, and renewed his ſolicitations in favour of Clariſſa: He then expatiated on her penitence, virtue, and ill health; read a very contrite letter written by Lovelace to Clariſſa, with her high-ſoul'd anſwer; and afterward mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his viſit to Miſs Howe, read ſome of the paſſages he had tranſcribed from Clariſſa's letters to that lady; particularly one, in
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:029413_0113_0FE0F2A139C29F00"/>
which ſhe aſked what could be done for her now, ſhould her friends be ever ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And wiſhed, more for their ſakes than for her own, that they would ſtill relent; and then complained that ſhe was very ill, and muſt drop her pen. At this, Mrs. Harlowe, weeping and wringing her hands, cried, O my child! my child! They all ſeemed affected, except Clariſſa's brother, who, addreſſing himſelf to the good lady, cried, Dear Madam, pray recollect that you have more children than this ungrateful one. Mr. Morden was at length permitted to proceed with his extracts; and again moved every one to pity the unhappy Clariſſa; but her brother going to each, ſtrove to harden their hearts, and in particular again reminded his mother, that ſhe had other children; aſking, what was there in all that was read, but the reſult of his ſiſter's talent at moving the paſſions? Mrs. Harlowe talked of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to town to ſee and comfort her poor unhappy daughter, and Mr. Morden offered his ſervice to eſcort her; but this too was over-ruled by the imperious brother, who rendered ineffectual all his endeavours to reſtore the dying Clariſſa to their favour. At this the Colonel exclaimed againſt his inhumanity, reproached him for his obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; and high words ariſing between them,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029413_0114_0FE0F22625AFDF78"/>
their reſentments were carried to a very great height; and every one ſiding with the brother, Mr. Morden, lifting up his hands and eyes, cried, To what hearts of flint am I related? O couſin Harlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

I will never more open my lips to you on this ſubject; but will inſtantly make my will, and in me ſhall the dear creature have the father, uncle, and brother ſhe has loſt. On ſaying this, he hurried out of the room, notwithſtanding their uſing their utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to detain him; and, calling for his horſe, rode away.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Clariſſa was buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in taking all ſuch meaſures as ſhe thought would render the office of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutor as little troubleſome as poſſible. That lady had not only rendered the view of death familiar to her mind, but longed for its approach, and every preparation for it was attended with pleaſure. She took a chair, and went to an undertaker's in Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, where ſhe beſpoke her coffin; and, with the greateſt compoſure, gave directions about ſome emblems, of which ſhe had made drawings, and choſe to have placed on the lid.</p>

Some days after ſhe had taken this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſtep, Mr. Belford paid her a viſit, and was but juſt ſeated, when he was ſtartled at hearing a rumbling noiſe upon the ſtairs, as if a large trunk had been bringing up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two people. Clariſſa bluſhed, and entreating him not to be ſurpriſed, ſaid they were bringing her ſomething before the time. In an inſtant Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick entered, crying, O Madam, what have you done? and Mr. Belford ſtarting up and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the door, to his great ſurpriſe, they told him it was a coffin. With the utmoſt intrepidity and calmneſs Clariſſa aroſe, and directed the men to carry it into her bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber: and then returning, ſaid, Pray excuſe me, Mr. Belford; and don't you, Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick, be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; there is nothing more in it than the uncommonneſs of the thing. May we not be as reaſonably ſhocked at going to church, where are the monuments of our anceſtors, with whoſe duſt we hope ours will one day be mingled, as to be affected at ſuch a ſight as this?

            <p>The coffin was covered with fine black cloth, and lined with white ſatin; and the burial dreſs was brought in with it. Mrs. Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

She laid before Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a particular account of what ſhe would have done immediately after her deceaſe; ſhewed him where ſhe had depoſited her will, and where ſhe had put her letters and copies of letters; and then cauſed him to ſeal up all with his own ſeal in her preſence. This was done with an air ſo compoſed and cheerful, as equally ſurprized and affected both him and the women who were preſent. Then rubbing her eyes, which ſhe ſaid were miſty, and looking intently upon them, God bleſs you all! cried ſhe. How kindly are you

            <p>That gentleman ſoon after retired, and immediately wrote to Colonel Morden, that if he expected to ſee his beloved couſin alive, he muſt loſe no time; and by the ſame poſt Dr. H—wrote to her father, to acquaint him, that he had yet an opportunity to ſave himſelf and family great future regret, by diſpatching one of it, with his and his lady's laſt bleſſing, to the moſt excellent lady of her ſex; and after giving the higheſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums on her conduct, which, he ſaid, was that in which a dying ſaint might glory, he obſerved, that whatever was done, muſt be done ſpeedily; for he did not think ſhe could live above a week; and how long of that time ſhe might enjoy her ſenſes, ſo as to receive comfort from the favours he might think proper to confer upon her, he could not pretend to ſay.</p>
            <p>Mr. Belford had communicated to Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace every particular as it paſſed, and that gentleman now ſeeing the effects of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainous treatment he had given the excellent

lady, whom he had forced into his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was now ſtung by the reproaches of his own conſcience. Sick of himſelf, ſick of the remembrance of his vile plots, which had brought upon him ſuch heavy, ſuch durable remorſe, he, in unavailing anguiſh, uttered his complaints to Mr. Belford, bidding aim tell the doctor, that if he could recover her, he would make him a preſent of a thouſand guineas; but deſiring him, that if ſhe really left the world, he would not bluntly tell hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I have the honour to be nearly related to her; ſtep up, pray, and if ſhe be ſenſible, tell her that I am here. Who is with her? She replied, there was nobody but her nurſe and Mrs. Lovick, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Mr. Belford was with her. He then deſired to ſpeak with Mr. Belford, who
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029413_0120_0FE0F23633ED0B88"/>
came down to him; when being informed that ſhe was ſitting in a ſound ſleep, the Colonel begged that he might ſee her, though ſleeping; for his impatience was too great to permit his ſtaying till ſhe awaked, and he would not have her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed. Mrs. Smith, therefore, ſtepping up before them, deſired Mrs. Lovick and the nurſe not to ſtir when they entered. Colonel Morden, on his being introduced by Mr. Belford, found her dreſſed in white, with her left arm round Mrs. Lovick's neck, who ſet cloſe by her. One faded cheek reſted upon the good woman's breaſt, the kindly warmth of which had overſpread it with a faint but charming fluſh; the other paler and hollow. Her hands, which were extremely white, hung lifeleſs, one before her, the other was held by the affectionate widow, whoſe tears bedewed the face which her motherly boſom ſupported. Her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance had an air of the ſweeteſt calmneſs and ſerenity, and her ſleep ſeemed eaſy; her breath was indeed quick and ſhort, but tolerably free, and did not appear like that of a perſon on the verge of life. In this affecting attitude ſhe appeared before her couſin Morden, who ſighing often, gazed upon her with folded arms, and the moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate attention; till, at laſt, on her

ſtarting, and fetching her breath with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er difficulty than before, he retired to a ſcreen that was drawn before her coffin, which ſtood under the window. This ſcreen was placed there as ſoon as Clariſſa was obliged to take to her chamber; though Mr. Belford, in the ſhort converſation he had with the Colonel, had forgot to inform him of what he would probably ſee.</p>
            <p>On his retiring thither, he drew out his handkerchief, and, drowned in grief, ſeemed unable to ſpeak; but on caſting his eyes downwards, he perceived the ſhape of a cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin; and lifting up a purple cloth that was ſpread over it, he ſtarted back, crying, Good God! what's here? Mrs. Smith ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up ſoftly to him; but while he was, in a low voice, blaming her for ſuffering his couſin to indulge her gloomy reflections with ſuch an object, and ſhe vindicating her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Clariſſa heaved a profound ſigh, ſtarted, and awaked. She obſerved, that ſhe had ſlept without being refreſhed, and that her fingers ends ſeemed numbed. Mr. Belford told her, that her couſin Morden had called there, and would return in half an hour; but he feared to ſurpriſe her. Nothing in this world can now ſurpriſe me, ſaid ſhe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my dear mamma was to come, and favour me with her laſt bleſſing. That
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:029413_0122_0FE0F23BC7AB64E8"/>
would even yet be a welcome ſurpriſe. But if he comes, what ſhall I do about that ſcreen? He will probably chide me, and I can't bear chiding now.</p>
            <p>Mr. Belford now favoured Mr. Morden's retreat, and the ſcreen was placed as near the window as poſſible, to prevent his ſeeing what was behind it; while he, hearing all ſhe ſaid, reſolved to take no notice of it. He ſoon after ſent in his name, and being inſtantly admitted, folded the lady in his arms as ſhe ſat, dropping down on one knee; for placing her hands on the elbows of the chair, ſhe attempted to riſe, but could not. Excuſe me, my dear couſin, ſaid ſhe, excuſe my not ſtanding up. I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſuch a favour now; but I am glad of this opportunity of thanking you for all your kind and generous goodneſs. I never, my beſt beloved and deareſt couſin, ſaid he, the tears guſhing from his eyes, ſhall forgive myſelf that I did not attend you ſooner. Little did I think you were ſo ill; nor do any of your friends believe it. If they did—If they did, repeated ſhe, interrupting him, I ſhould have more compaſſion for them—I am ſure I ſhould. But pray, Sir, how did you leave them? Are you recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to them? If you are not, I beg, if you love your poor Clariſſa, that you will; for
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:029413_0123_0FE0F2B9967F3378"/>
every widened difference ſerves to augment my fault, ſince that is the foundation of all. He then told her, that he had brought her the accounts of her grandfather's eſtate, with bills and draughts upon their banker<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt ſhe ſhould be in want of money; and that this was ſuch an earneſt of an approaching reconciliation, that he dared to anſwer for every thing elſe. Ah, Sir! cried ſhe.—with frequent breaks and pauſes.—I wiſh, I wiſh this does not rather ſhew, that, were I to live, they would have nothing more to ſay to me. I never had any pride in being independent: all my actions, when I might have made myſelf more ſo, ſhew this. She then apologized for having troubled Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford with the office of being her executor, from her not having ſeen him ſooner, and not knowing that he ſtill honoured her with his regard; and entreated him not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her on Lovelace. After this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of her being very faint and low, and expreſſing her ſorrow that ſhe could not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſerve the honour of that viſit, ſhe ſunk back into her chair, and was ſilent; on which the colonel and Mr. Belford inſtantly withdrew.</p>
            <p>Clariſſa had before remarked, that all would be moſt conveniently over in bed: the ſolemn, the important moment approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029413_0124_0FE0F23F1A0675D8"/>
but her ſoul ardently aſpiring after im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, ſhe imagined the time moved ſlowly; and with great preſence of mind, ſhe gave orders in relation to her body, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting her nurſe and the maid of the houſe, as ſoon as ſhe was cold, to put her into her coffin. The colonel, after paying her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other viſit, wrote to her uncle Mr. John Harlowe, that they might ſave themſelves the trouble of having any farther debates about reconciliation; for before they could reſolve, his dear couſin would probably be no more.</p>
            <p>A day or two after, Mr. Belford was ſent for, and immediately came: at his entrance he ſaw the colonel kneeling by her bed-ſide with the lady's right hand in both his, which his face covered, bathing it with his tears, though ſhe had juſt been endeavouring to comfort him, in noble and elevated ſtrains. On the oppoſite ſide of the bed was ſeated Mrs. Lovick, who leaning againſt the bed's head in a moſt diſconſolate manner, turned to him, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, crying, O Mr. Belford, the dear lady!—a heavy ſigh not permitting her to ſay more. Mrs. Smith was kneeling at the bed's feet, with claſped fingers and uplifted eyes, with the tears trickling in large drops down her cheeks, as if imploring help from the Source of life and every comfort.</p>

The excellent lady had been <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent a few minutes, and was thought ſpeechleſs, ſhe moving her lips without uttering a word; but when Mrs. Lovick, on Mr. Belford's approach, pronounced his name, O Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford! cried ſhe, in a faint inward voice, Now!—now!—I bleſs God, all will ſoon be over—a few—a very few moments will end this ſtrife—and I ſhall be happy!—Comfort, Sir,—comfort, my couſin—See!—the blameable kindneſs!—He does not wiſh me to be happy ſo ſoon!—Then pauſing for two or three minutes, during which her looks were earneſtly fixed on the colonel, My deareſt couſin, ſhe reſumed, be comforted!—What is dying but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lot?—The mortal frame may ſeem to labour—but that is all: it is not ſo hard to die as I thought—The prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the difficulty, and I bleſs God I have had time for that!—the reſt is worſe to beholders than to me!—I am all bleſſed hope—hope itſelf! Here her looks expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this truth; for a ſweet ſmile overſpread her countenance. After a ſhort ſilence, Once more, my dear couſin, ſaid ſhe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me moſt dutifully to my father and mother, to my ſiſter, to my brother, to my uncles—Tell them I bleſs them with my departing breath—for all their diſpleaſure,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:029413_0126_0FE0F2462EBD7828"/>
I bleſs them—Moſt happy has been my puniſhment here, happy—indeed.</p>
            <p>She was again ſilent for a few moments, lifting up her eyes, and the hand her couſin did not hold between his, and then cried, "O death! where is thy ſting?"—"It is good for me that I was afflicted." Then turning to the colonel and Mr. Belford, who were loſt in ſpeechleſs ſorrow, O dear, dear gentlemen, ſaid ſhe, you don't know what foretaſtes—what aſſurances—Here ſhe again ſtopped, and looked upward, ſweetly ſmiling, as if in a thankful rapture.</p>
            <p>She then turned her head towards Mr. Belford, and ſaid, Do you, Sir, tell your friend, that I forgive him! And I pray God forgive him! again pauſing, and lifting up her eyes, as if praying for his forgiveneſs. Let him know, added ſhe, how happily I die, and that I wiſh his laſt hour may be like mine.</p>
            <p>Again ſhe was ſilent for a few moments, and then reſuming—My ſight fails me!—your voices only—but the voice of grief is alike in all. Is not this Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's hand, preſſing one of his with her hand, which ſhe had juſt let go? Which is Mr. Belford's? added ſhe, holding out the other. He gave her his. God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty bleſs you both, and make you both
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:029413_0127_0FE0F2C3F8C52848"/>
in your laſt hour—for you muſt come to this—as happy as I am.</p>
            <p>Again ſhe pauſed, her breath growing ſhorter; and after a few minutes, And now, my deareſt couſin, give me your hand—nearer—nearer ſtill, added ſhe, drawing it towards her, and preſſing it to her dying lips—God protect you, dear, dear Sir! and once more receive my beſt and moſt grateful thanks—and tell my dear Miſs Howe—ſhe will one day, I fear not, be a ſaint in heaven.</p>
            <p>After again continuing for a ſhort time ſilent, ſhe reſumed, in a more faint and broken accent, And you, Mr. Belford, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his hand, may God preſerve you, and make you ſenſible of all your errors!—may you be—She then ſunk her head upon her pillow, and fainting away, drew from them her hands. They all thoughts ſhe was gone, and each gave way to a violent burſt of grief. But ſoon ſhewing ſigns of returning life, their attention was again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; and when a little recovered, Mr. Belford, entreated her to complete in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour her half-pronounced bleſſing; when waving her hand to him and her coffin, and bowing her head to every one preſent, not omitting the nurſe and the maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029413_0128_0FE0F24C66F534A0"/>
with a faultering and inward voice, ſhe added, Bleſs—bleſs—bleſs—you all!—And now—and now—for the laſt time, holding up her almoſt lifeleſs hands,—Come, O come—bleſſed Lord Jeſus!—And with theſe words ſhe expired, with ſuch a ſmile, ſuch a ſweet ſerenity, at that inſtant overſpreading her face, as ſeemed to expreſs her eternal happineſs already begun.</p>
            <p>Mr. Belford and the colonel preſſed her ſtill warm though lifeleſs hand with their lips, and then retired into the next room, where they looked at each other as if going to ſpeak; but, as if one motion governed, as one cauſe affected both, they turned away ſilent. Mr. Morden ſighed as if his heart would burſt; and at laſt, lifting up his hands and face, Good Heaven! ſaid he, ſupport me! And is it thus, O flower of nature!—Muſt we no more—never more—my bleſſed, bleſſed couſin—And then, as if recollecting himſelf, Forgive me, Sir! he added—O excuſe me, Mr. Belford, and haſtily paſſing by him, walked down ſtairs and left the houſe; Mr. Belford remaining ſilent and motionleſs as a ſtatue: but, at laſt, recovering himſelf as well as he was able, he wrote to two of his companions to haſten to Lovelace, to prevent his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome act of deſperation; and then ſent
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:029413_0129_0FE0F2CA958579C8"/>
to the latter a ſhort note, in which were only theſe words, <q>I have only to ſay at preſent, thou wilt do well to take a tour to Paris, or where-ever thy deſtiny ſhall lead thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The very day after Clariſſa's death, a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in livery brought for her a letter from her brother, and another from her ſiſter, to comfort and aſſure her of her father's and mother's bleſſing, which ſhe had ſo ardently longed for, and which, had they come in time, ſhe would have received with great joy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Belford, on looking over her papers, found ſhe had written letters to be ſent after her deceaſe, to every one of her family; alſo to Miſs Howe and Lovelace; and one to himſelf. Theſe were all written in a tender, pious, and generous ſtrain, in order to give comfort, rather than diſtreſs; her duty, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and piety, appeared in every line; and all of them expreſſed the ecſtatic aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that when thoſe letters came to their hands, ſhe ſhould be enjoying eternal felicity.</p>
            <p>Mr. Belford, now in the character of her executor, ſent one of his ſervants with the poſthumous letters to the family, and to Miſs Howe, and alſo a letter from Colonel. Morden, to acquaint Mr. James Harlowe with his ſiſter's death, and her deſire to be interred near her grandfather. This meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029413_0130_0FE0F2520D38A0D8"/>
found the whole family aſſembled, on occaſion of the letter the Colonel had before ſent, and flattering themſelves with the hopes, that to haſten their reſolutions, their couſin had repreſented her worſe than ſhe really was; but the ſervant had no ſooner deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the letter that contained the fatal news, than the whole houſe was in the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, the ſervants running different ways, lamenting and wringing their hands; Mrs. Harlowe was in fits, and all in ſuch diſorder, that he could get no commands, nor obtain any notice of himſelf.</p>
            <p>He therefore proceeded to Mrs. Howe's, where he had the precaution to deſire to ſpeak with Miſs's maid, to whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the fatal news, that ſhe might break it to her miſtreſs. The maid herſelf was ſo affected, that the old lady came to ſee what ailed her, and was herſelf ſo ſtruck with the communication, that ſhe was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſit down. O the ſweet creature! ſaid ſhe, And is it come to this?—O my poor Nancy—How ſhall I be able to break the matter to my Nancy! When Mrs. Howe was a little recovered, ſhe went up, in order to let her daughter know the dreadful tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, taking the letter and ſalts in her hand. Inſtantly the houſe-keeper, with her face overſpread with tears, came hurrying down
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:029413_0131_0FE0F2CF6DEE2DC0"/>
into the kitchen, crying, her young miſtreſs had fainted away; nor did ſhe wonder at it—There never lived a lady more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of general admiration than Miſs Clariſſa Harlowe! and never was their a ſtronger friendſhip diſſolved by death, than between her young lady and her. She then hurried away with a lighted wax candle, and feathers to burn under the noſe of her young miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. Morden reſolved to accompany the hearſe to Harlowe-Place. The coffin was filled with flowers and aromatic herbs; and proper care taken to prevent the corpſe from being moved by the jolting of the hearſe. He arrived at Harlowe-Place, ſome time before the body. At his entrance into the court, all were in motion, every ſervant he ſaw had ſwelled eyes, and ſeemed deeply concerned. But a perfect concert of grief broke out the moment they ſaw him enter the parlour. Mr. Harlowe, the father, no ſooner caſt his eyes upon him, than he cried, O couſin, couſin, you are the only perſon of all our family, who have nothing to reproach yourſelf with! The poor mother, bowing her head to him, in ſpeechleſs grief, ſat with her handkerchief held to her eyes with one hand, while her ſiſter Harvey held the other between both hers, weeping upon it. Mr.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029413_0132_0FE0F2579CF544E0"/>
Anthony Harlowe, who conducted Colonel Morden into the room, went towards Mrs. Harlowe, crying, Don't—don't—dear ſiſter! then towards the afflicted father, Don't—don't, dear brother, don't thus give way—and without being able to ſay an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other word, went to a corner of the room, and, wanting himſelf the comfort he ſtrove to give, ſunk into a chair, and ſobbed aloud.</p>
            <p>The colonel then approaching the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolable mother, ſaid, Let us not, Madam, give way to a grief, which however juſt, can be of no avail. We hurt ourſelves, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not recal the dear creature for whom we mourn. Nor indeed would you wiſh it, did you but know with what aſſurances of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs ſhe left the world. She is happy, Madam!—depend upon it, ſhe is happy! and let this be your comfort. O couſin, couſin! cried the unhappy mother, withdrawing her hand from her ſiſter Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey's and preſſing the colonel's with it. You know not what a child I have loſt!—and how loſt! That it is that makes my loſs inſupportable.</p>
            <p>They now all joined in the melancholy chorus, each accuſing him and herſelf, and ſome one another. But the eyes of all were in turn fixed upon James Harlowe, as the perſon who had kept up the general reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:029413_0133_0FE0F2D501806640"/>
while he ſeemed hardly able to bear his own remorſe, nor Miſs Harlowe hers, ſhe breaking out, How tauntingly did I write to her! How barbarouſly did I inſult her! Yet how patiently did ſhe bear it! O brother, brother!—but for you!—but for you!—Double not upon me, cried he, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting her, my own woes! I only tho't to reclaim a dear creature that had erred! I did not intend to break her heart! but it was the villainous Lovelace who did that—not any of us! We muſt forever lament, cried the unhappy mother, our unkindneſs to ſo ſweet a child!—Indeed, indeed, added ſhe ſoftly to her ſiſter Harvey, I have been too paſſive, much too paſſive. The tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary quiet I have, all my life, been ſo ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to preſerve, will coſt me everlaſting diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet!—Dear ſiſter! was all the anſwer Mrs. Harvey could make.—I have done but half my duty to the deareſt and moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of my children, reſumed the afflicted mother;—nay, not half—How have we hardened our hearts againſt her! Again her tears choaked up the paſſage of her words, and, Deareſt, deareſt ſiſter! was all the reply Mrs. Harvey could make. Would to heaven, proceeded the mother, I had but once ſeen her! Then lifting up her eyes to her ſon and daughter, ſhe added, O James!
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:029413_0134_0FE0F25D2CC4A1E0"/>
O Arabella! were we to receive as little mercy!</p>
            <p>The hearſe at length came to the gate, and a ſervant entered to let them know what its lumbering heavy noiſe up the paved inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court-yard had before apprized them of; unable to ſpeak, he looked, bowed, and withdrew. Clariſſa, having been univerſally beloved, on account of her being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon patroneſs of all the honeſt poor in the neighbourhood, about fifty men, women, and children, had, at the ſolemn tolling of the bell of the pariſh church, aſſembled; this was a reſpect paid to the memory of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, out of officious love, as the hearſe paſſed near the church. Several of theſe people made a good appearance, but not one of them had a dry eye, each lamenting the death of the admirable lady, who never ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out but ſomebody was the better for it. When the coffin was taken out of the hearſe, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe crowding about it, for a few moments, hindered its being carried in, the young people ſtriving who ſhould bear it. At length, ſix maidens were permitted to carry it by the ſix handles, into a parlour adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the hall, which Clariſſa uſed to call her parlour, and placed it on a table in the middle of the room; but when the father and mother, her aunt Harvey, the two uncles,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:029413_0135_0FE0F2D8650B2398"/>
and her ſiſter came in, joining her brother and Mr. Morden, the ſcene became ſtill more affecting. Their ſorrow was, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, heightened by the idea of their cruelty; and now ſeeing before them the receptacle that contained the glory of their family, who was ſo lately driven thence by their indiſcreet and cruel violence, no wonder their grief was more than they knew how to bear. They would have with-held the mother <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> entering the parlour; but when they could not, though undetermined before, led by an irreſiſtable impulſe, they all bore her company. The poor lady did but juſt caſt her eye upon the coffin, and then ſnatching it away, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with paſſionate grief towards the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, addreſſing herſelf to her beloved daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, O my child! my child! cried ſhe, thou pride of my hope! why, oh why was not I permitted to ſpeak pardon and peace to thee? O forgive thy cruel mother! The father's grief was too deep for utterance, till he ſaw his ſon coming in, when giving a groan, Never, ſaid he, was ſorrow like mine! O ſon, ſon! added he in a reproaching ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Her uncles and her ſiſter frequently looked and turned away on the emblems, in ſilent ſorrow. Mrs. Harvey would have read to them the inſcription: theſe words ſhe did read: "Here the wicked ceaſe
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:029413_0136_0FE0F26234EE23F0"/>
from troubling;" but could proceed no farther, her tears falling in large drops upon the plate ſhe was contemplating.</p>
            <p>Theſe mourners were no ſooner retired, than Mr. Morden ordered the lid of the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin to be unſcrewed, and cauſed ſome freſh aromatics and flowers to be put into it. The maids who brought the flowers were ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Afterwards the afflicted parents propoſed to take one laſt view of their once darling daughter, but having reached the door, neither of them were able to enter the room.</p>
            <p>Miſs Howe came the next morning in her chariot, for the laſt time, to behold her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friend.
