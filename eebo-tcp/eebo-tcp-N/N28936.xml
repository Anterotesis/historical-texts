         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SO general an appearance of affliction was never depicted here before. To ſtand in this immenſe concourſe of fellow citizens, where every face is marked with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, almoſt unmans the ſpeaker. Verily there is a great mourning here to-day, like the mourning of Iſrael when MOSES died, and to improve the occaſion let us turn to</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>EXODUS xi. 3.</bibl>
—<hi>Moreover the man MOSES was very great in the land of Egypt, in the ſight of Pharoah's ſervants, and in the ſight of the people.</hi>

            <p>IT muſt be a ſolemn ſeaſon, when a great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lament before the LORD, the death of thoſe, whom his infinite goodneſs hath made the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their greateſt benefits. On ſuch occaſions the mind muſt be impreſſed with me ſovereignty of GOD, and frailty of man in his beſt earthly eſtate; and a tender and reſpectful
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038577_0004_101296530BECAC60"/>
remembrance of deceaſed virtues will open all hearts to a mutual condolence. All bleſſings are from GOD, who upholds the civil ſtate, girds the civil and military rulers of men, and keeps his church in peace and quietneſs, thro the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of his ſervants who fear his name.</p>
            <p>The LORD hath ſet his king upon his holy hill of Zion, who is the CREATOR, REDEEMER, and JUDGE of men. He is GOD forever on the throne in heaven, and thro the earth, and to fulfil his counſels he works thro inſtruments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by himſelf, and made worthy of acting in his name, and bearing the marks of a divine commiſſion. There have been but few men in the world eminently great, and thoſe have, in general, been on the ſide of virtue. There have been many tyrants and deſtroyers, for it requires only ſmall talents to work ruin; but to build up, to bleſs, to humanize ſociety, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the oppreſſed, to vindicate human liberty, and at the ſame time reſtrain licentiouſneſs, is an arduous taſk; where none but good men will be inclined to expoſe themſelves, and which none but great men are able to accompliſh.</p>
            <p>That we may on this occaſion, honor the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Sovereign of the world, and duly eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the public loſs ſuſtained, let us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Contemplate the providence of GOD in raiſing up great and eminent men, and qualify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038577_0005_101296549FDE6E98"/>
them for the good which they are appointed to do to mankind.</p>
            <p>In the formation of ſuch perſons, there muſt be a union of rare and great natural talents, with an eminent love of moral virtue. when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever GOD hath a great work to do in the world, he forms inſtruments fitted for the truſt to be repoſed in them, who are poſſeſſed of talents, guided by his providential care, and inſpired with a ſpirit of underſtanding from himſelf, whereby they are enabled, whatever difficulties and oppoſition may occur, to do the things determined for them.</p>
            <p>We know that thoſe, who deſpiſe a ſupreme providence, are prone to refer every remarkable thing, either to a certain blind neceſſity of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they cannot deſcribe, or to the effects of accidental but uncommon genius; indeed like other fooliſh men who think themſelves to be wiſe, they have recourſe to any means which will hide the being, the holy perfections, and the providence of GOD. Herein infidels ſhow themſelves to be at an equal remove from piety, wiſdom and truth; and that they are as far from diſcerning in what the true greatneſs of a creature conſiſts, as they are from being good and pious.</p>
            <p>The riſe of eminent and good men is one of the higheſt diſplays of a ſupreme Providence,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038577_0006_101296577240AF60"/>
for they always appear at periods, when there is a work prepared for them to do, for the honor of GOD and the good of the world, and at no other times; ſo that we may conſider their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and introduction to the ſcenes of action, their good lives and their great actions, eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial of a SUPREME BEING, of the ſtability of his counſels and the irreſiſtible energy of his government.</p>
            <p>Divine wiſdom, in the proviſion of means and inſtruments, always hath regard to the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the work that is to be done by them in the world, under the direction of his providence. To accompliſh a great work in the earth he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own inſtruments great, either thro un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common natural endowments, aſſiſted by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of propitious providences; or by a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aid evidencing their commiſſion and the preſence of GOD with them in diſcharging ſome important truſt, or in both of thoſe ways at the ſame time. MOSES, the Father, Lawgiver, and Commander of Iſrael was great, in the fight of Iſrael his people, and in the fight of Pharaoh and his ſervants their enemies, both by uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon natural endowments and by ſupernatural aid. The FATHER of his Country, for whoſe deceaſe we mourn before the LORD this day, was made great in the fight of his people, and of all their enemies, by his eminent natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which GOD was pleaſed to aid by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038577_0007_1012965A5D709F00"/>
of propitious providences, for the ſalvation and good government of his country.</p>
            <p>When we ſee remarkable inſtruments of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence coming into action, it indicates an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting period in that ſcheme of divine counſel, which will be forever unfolding; and when ſuch inſtruments of bleſſing to mankind are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn by the power which raiſed them up, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes cauſe for public mourning and fear; cauſe for mourning, for every good man will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret the departure of virtue from the earth; cauſe of fear, for we are told that the righteous are taken from the evil to come, and that while they live, GOD will ſpare an ungrateful people from judgments, for their ſakes.</p>
            <p>When a MOSES, a CYRUS, and a WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON were brought on the ſtage of action, it was to effect changes in the ſtate of mankind, favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to religion and civil rights, which could not have been done, in the manner that divine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel choſe to execute, under the auſpices of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon characters, nor even of great men, as great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is uſually eſtimated in this imperfect world. Theſe actors in the ſcenes of the world, were ſpecially raiſed up, and guided by an infinite GOD, to atchieve things which will ever make them celebrated in the hiſtory of mankind and of the church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:038577_0008_1012965E68F9E228"/>
Much honor is due to them as inſtruments of Almighty goodneſs. Let their virtues—their love and friendſhip to human nature—their juſtice—their firmneſs in holding the ſword of the LORD—and their political eminence as rulers and lawgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; let theſe be admired and remain perpetual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to ſuch as wiſh to be on GOD's ſide; but let the glory of faſhioning them from the womb, of girding them to lead his armies, of inſpiring them to give laws to nations or creating new commonwealths, and of enabling them to die great as they had lived; let the glory of theſe things be given to GOD.</p>
            <p>It can be no glory to a man, either living or departed, to ſay that the great things he hath done for his country, either by his ſword or ſceptre, were done without a divine aid; for all conſiderate perſons would know it to be a falſe eulogy. Even infidels, in the midſt of their vain pretenſions, know there is a divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and in the profane words they utter on this ſubject, they ſpeak the wiſhes of their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not the dictates of their conſciences and of their better underſtandings. Such men are like actors in a farce, ſaying that which they know to be untrue, and it is a falſe complaiſance to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they may be honeſt; for it is very evident they dare not truſt their own honeſty, when dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and death approach them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:038577_0009_101296613B98DDD0"/>
The higheſt honor which we can give to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, is to ſay, that the infinite Author of life, power and wiſdom, made them greater and more virtuous than other men, inſpired them with talents above their brethren, and filled them with a rare underſtanding, to do things for the glory of GOD and the good of mankind, which were not permitted to others.—Many have made a conſpicuous figure for a ſhort ſeaſon and within national limits, who were neither great nor good; but death is written on the glory of ſuch, by the pen of future hiſtorians, nor is it their privilege to live in the affections of mankind, or to be held up as examples for forming the morals of the world. Their praiſe reſted in adventitious circumſtances found in the corruption of courts, and an era of falſe opinions, and was never ſpoken by plain and good men, who were not poiſoned by ſenſuality and the expectations of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled ambition; but the merits of great and good men, are ſeen by perſons of every deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The peaſant deſcries them as ſoon as the man of letters.—They are more admired by the virtuous yeomanry of a country, than by the gay circle who bow and flatter to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves noticed.</p>
            <p>Such inſtruments of GOD's goodneſs to men, have a divine impreſſion on their character, ſeen by all virtuous people—all look to them as
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038577_0010_10129662E8BBC3D0"/>
being, under GOD, fathers, defenders in war, and rulers in peace. Such was MOSES to the Hebrews, and ſuch was WASHINGTON to us. If any expect me this day to draw his character with preciſion, let me beg ſuch to recollect that they are expecting an impoſſibility, and that it is as much beyond me to do this as it is to be ſuch a man as he was. All will allow, that he was formed by the providence of GOD, to walk in a path where other men cannot guide their ſteps, and to be an eminent agent in the formation of a new empire, which is to be conſpicuous in the future hiſtory of mankind; but what it is to be ſuch an inſtrument of the infinite Ruler, what divine energies meet in originally forming and providentially guiding, and how thoſe energies were conſciouſly felt and exerted by the recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, certainly is not for me to tell and for but few of mankind to conceive.</p>
            <p>MOSES was formed to reſcue the ancient and eaſtern Iſrael from bondage, and after they were reſcued to form their civil, military and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſtate, and be an inſtrument of delivering the moral law to mankind in a new manner; and he was, in every reſpect, perfected for the office to which heaven deſigned him.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON was formed to reſcue from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage the modern and weſtern Iſrael of the LORD, and after they were ſaved from foreign enemies
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038577_0011_101296674B4EA358"/>
by his ſword, to ſave them, a ſecond time, from deſtruction by themſelves; from the miſeries of anarchy; and to bring them into a ſtate of government, whereby they might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from devouring one another, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devoured by the whole earth. Theſe were great objects in the divine government, and worthy of that diſplay of his ſufficiency, which was made in the proviſion of inſtruments. The glory of furniſhing protectors muſt belong to GOD, and if the people who have been ſaved are pious, they will praiſe him for the means of executing his moſt gracious counſel. The formation of great characters, for the good of mankind, is really an exhibition of GOD's providential efficiency, and is obſerved by the pious as a diſplay of himſelf, thro the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of means made for his own glory. Their progreſs and their works thro life are the unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his gracious counſels, and their exit from time is to be marked as a temporary withdrawment of the remarkable energies of divine providence, in favor of thoſe who have been his care. For this reaſon, the whole congregation of Iſrael mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thirty days when MOSES died; and for the ſame reaſon the American Iſrael mourn when WASHINGTON dies.</p>
            <p>We are not to think, that the LORD can give counſel and preſerve, only by thoſe who have been great inſtruments of ſalvation; nor are we
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038577_0012_10129668DCF3A6D0"/>
to diſtruſt a future divine care; or to ſuppoſe that he will not raiſe up inſtruments according to the day and exigencies in which they have to act; but ſtill the withdrawment of ſo great a benefactor, under exiſting circumſtances, is to be devoutly and penitentially noticed as a divine frown; eſpecially when we conſider the evidence that he was remarkably formed to be the father and deliverer of his country. None who have conſidered the American revolution with its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent events and the ſtate of our country, can deny this; nor can they doubt the evidence of a moſt wonderful interpoſition of heaven, in the formation and continuance of one ſo fitted to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our great national wants.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are two kinds of evidence by which great and good men are clearly commiſſioned from on high, to act a conſpicuous part, under GOD, in his government of the world. The firſt is, ſupernatural works which evidence them to be immediate organs of divine power and truth ſpeaking to men. The ſecond, is uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon natural talents and moral integrity, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with fit opportunities for their exertion. In the caſe of MOSES, both theſe evidences were united to anſwer particular purpoſes in the divine government of the world, at that period of time.</p>
            <p>His natural abilities and moral attainments were great, and continued to the end of his life;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038577_0013_1012966BB7B7CB40"/>
for when he died an old man, his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. He was ſkill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the learning of the world, and eſpecially in the wiſdom of that people, whom he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the power of GOD to overcome. By a ſpecial providence, he was brought into a ſtate of power and riches, and reputedly the ſon of Pharaoh's daughter, that having had an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental taſte of worldly wealth and pleaſure, and found its vanity compared with the delights of moral and pious integrity, he might not be brib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his duty by any worldly overture, when he came to a ſtate of confidential truſt.</p>
            <p>Whoever reads his hiſtory as a lawgiver and military leader, conſidering the condition of the world in thoſe ages when he acted, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was a great and good man, even apart from thoſe ſupernatural aids, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to evidence his appointment and authority from heaven, and that he had that uncommon genius and ſelf-command which all can ſee and admire, but only a rare few can imitate in the ſcience and practice of legiſlation and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Alſo, he was a good man, fearing the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and adoring the holineſs of the GOD of Iſrael. If he had not been poſſeſſed of religious rectitude; neither great natural talents, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired attainments, nor ſupernatural aid could
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038577_0014_1012966D50559C30"/>
have given him ſo venerable an appearance in the eyes of his people, and ſanctified their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the opinion of all poſterity. At the head of the LORD's Iſrael he was a meek man, and humble in the midſt of greatneſs. He eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed himſelf one among many brethren and citizens, and relying on a divine providence to lead him and the people to whom his life was conſecrated, he was never forſaken, but witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a gracious preſence thro his whole adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration.</p>
            <p>To the evidence that he was divinely commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, which aroſe from great natural talents and uncommon piety, we may add the ſupernat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural works he was enabled to perform, and the revelations which were made to him. To learn the reaſon, why theſe additional and great evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the divine preſence were given to MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SES, we muſt conſider the extent of his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The flood had once cleanſed the world of idolatry, but at the time of this great prophet, the nations in their new diſperſion had forgotten the LORD, and the worſhip of idols had become almoſt univerſal. The people of Iſrael, who were deſcendents of Abraham, were deſigned to be depoſitaries of a written law of religion, and the works of providence, which regarded them and their enemies, were intended to ſhow that their LORD JEHOVAH, was the GOD of the whole earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:038577_0015_10129672DD30FDF0"/>
Theſe intentions of heaven were foretold to their fathers, and to accompliſh the divine prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe it was neceſſary a character like MOSES ſhould be raiſed up, who, being mighty in word and deed, ſhould confound the idolizing nations, ſo that the world might look upon him and ſee that his LORD was the true GOD. Alſo, that no other ruler of men had been like unto him, in all the ſigns and wonders which he was ſent to do, and in all that mighty hand and all that terror which he ſhewed in the fight of Iſrael and their enemies. This was the reaſon for a ſupernatural evidence of his divine commiſſion being added to thoſe rare talents and piety, which he poſſeſſed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with other great and good men, who were made by GOD, in their reſpective times, to honor his name and bleſs mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At other times GOD hath raiſed up his eminent ſervants and ſent them abroad into the world, without this ſupernatural evidence of their commiſſion from him; and indeed this hath been his uſual manner in providential govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But in all ſuch caſes, there hath been to the conſiderate obſerver, ſufficient notices of GOD's ſpecial providence, in forming his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and guiding and making them ſucceſsful in his hand, to execute the counſels of his will. The production of rare talents at a time when they are needed to execute the benevolent purpoſes of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038577_0016_101296746FB19070"/>
Providence, and preparing the way for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, is a ſufficient evidence that GOD is with the actor. In this part of my diſcourſe I ſhall paſs over many inſtances of the truth of this doctrine—many eventful epochs in the hiſtory of the world and the church—many great charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the cabinet, in the temple of the LORD and in the field, who were raiſed by the almighty providence of GOD, at fit times to execute his pre-determined counſels for the benefit of men; and I ſhall come down to our own times and the occaſion which hath gathered us before the LORD, the death of General WASHINGTON. Among modern characters there hath been none to whom the words of our text would more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently apply. He was very great, both in the ſight of his own people, and in the ſight of all their enemies; nor at the time of his death, was his eye dim, nor his natural force abated. As thro his life, ſo at the time of his death, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſeem to have been ſpecially ordered by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence to hide human weakneſs, and make him an extraordinary example to men, in fortitude and in all the moral virtues. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon age of man had not in him, impaired a great underſtanding, nor any of thoſe energies which decide in the cabinet or execute in the field.</p>
            <p>THIS GREAT MAN WAS AN AMERICAN BY BIRTH, and the country raiſed by his ſword into
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038577_0017_1012967748325BB0"/>
independence, and which he afterwards govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſupreme magiſtrate, gave him the political and moral ſentiments, which made him illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ſcenes of action. He early commenced the life of a ſoldier, and while a young officer, Monongahela witneſſed, and Britons owned the talents of the young American, in ſaving from ſlaughter the remains of an army ſufficiently humbled by ſavage fury and policy. Even, at that time, the talents of the youth cauſed a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that he would be the ſaviour of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but little was it conjectured how the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction would be fulfilled.<note n="*" place="bottom">In a note to a ſermon preached by that eminent ſervant of CHRIST, Preſident DAVIES, before Capt. Overton's independent company of volunteers, raiſed in Hanover county, Virginia, Aug. 17, 1755, entitled, "<hi>Religion and Patriotiſm the conſtituents of a good ſoldier,</hi>" as an example of this character, the author ſays, <q>As a remarkable inſtance of this, I may point out to the public that heroic youth, Col. WASHINGTON, whom I cannot but hope prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence has hitherto preſerved in ſo ſignal a manner, for ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervice to his country.</q> Whoever reads this muſt be convinced that there were early preſages of that great and good character, which General WASHINGTON hath ſince diſplayed, and that his greatneſs did not ariſe from a ſeries of accidental events. The man WASHINGTON was great in his youth, and prepared by almighty Providence to protect the American ſtate and church.</note>

            <p>It certainly cannot be expected of me, on this occaſion, particularly to recite the events which have made him beloved by his country, and owned as their preſerver, under the providence of GOD, who girded him for the field, and filled him with the ſpirit of underſtanding in all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concerns. To make ſuch a recital requires all the volumes, which have been, and the more
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038577_0018_1012967B5169D320"/>
numerous ones which will be written on this great ſubject.—It muſt ſuffice for me to ſay, that General WASHINGTON was the point of ſtrength around whom the political fathers and the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary defenders of this country have rallied, and where they repoſed their earthly confidence, from the moment a revolution was contemplated, as the only poſſible means of avoiding foreign oppreſſion, down to the preſent time. In a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of almoſt thirty years, we have ſeen many changes, many dangers from within and without, from foreign artifice and internal folly and caprice; and during the whole of this term, WASHINGTON has been the name, which would raiſe a martial ſpirit and point its energies by the waving of his ſword; or ſooth the multitude to peace, quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and ſubordination, as his voice and pen adviſed.—Theſe influential energies of the man, were not confined to the uninformed multitude only; for they had as much impreſſion on delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erating ſenates, as on armed ſquadrons;—he was as much the angel of peace as of war;—as much reſpected, as deeply reverenced in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical cabinet for a luminous coolneſs of diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby party jealouſy became enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and aſhamed of itſelf, as he was for a cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of command, in the dreadful moment, when empires hung ſuſpended on the fate of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.—His opinions became the opinions of the public body, and every man was pleaſed with himſelf when he found he thought like WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:038577_0019_1012967CF1FBCE90"/>
Our revolutionary war began ſuddenly, when the country was wholly unorganized in every department, that was neceſſary to maintain and enjoy an independent ſtate among the nations. There was paſſion enough, among all orders of men; but paſſion can endure only for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there is no ſafety in its dictates.</p>
            <p>It was General WASHINGTON who came cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ſcene of action, under a mighty impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the greatneſs of the labor to which he had permitted himſelf to be proclaimed, and for which, thro the aſſiſtance of GOD, he was found able both in word and in deed. He ordained ſyſtem—induced regularity—was found capable of reducing a half-armed multitude to military bravery and obedience, and for a long time had apparently to create the means, from day to day, by which he defended his country.</p>
            <p>It ſince appears, that while doing this in camp, his pen was the organ of wiſdom and of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering firmneſs to the councils of the union and of the ſeveral ſtates; and that the great men, who ſhone like ſtars of the firſt magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in the ſeveral parts of the American hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſphere where GOD had placed them, ſhone brighter for their communication with him.—His name ſoon became reverenced by our enemies, and wherever they heard of him, they joined the apprehenſion of a ſenate and hoſt. His name and the fear of him, and of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038577_0020_1012967E894BDE18"/>
a few tried men and ſoldiers, who were the heads of military departments and in the line of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſervice, often ſhielded the country againſt mighty hoſts, and finally ſaved the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and made it independent.</p>
            <p>The fame even of hiſtorians will be eternized, in relating how he with the band of his brother officers, and a patient, perſevering, gallant army under them, vindicated the foundation of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican empire, and then retired into the claſs of peaceful citizens, to eat the hard-earned, and in many inſtances, ſcanty bread of repoſe.</p>
            <p>General WASHINGTON was formed and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, in every reſpect, by the hand of Providence to perform the duty determined for him by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom. He was ſkilled, by an early edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in human ſcience. He expreſſed on all fit occaſions, a reverence of GOD, and his gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erning providence in all the events of individual life and of empire, and reſorted to the throne of grace and called on thoſe around him to do the ſame when danger threatened, or when ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs claimed his praiſe. He had a luminous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding—a mind above the ruffle of paſſion—was as far from the gaſconade of mock hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm as he was from a ſervile fear of men and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Nothing was too ſmall to call his attention, if it regarded the public good; at the ſame time he was naturally formed to look on great objects,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038577_0021_101296828ACEB940"/>
and ſurvey in one comprehenſive view, an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in all its civil and military intereſts.—He ſeemed intuitively to look thro men, and know the extent of their capacities to underſtand, and their abilities for exertion, and from this it came that the heads of departments thro his advice, were filled in general with ſuch extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and talents for exertion; and this was one circumſtance which eſſentially conduced to American triumph.—If the created honors, which are given by crowns and royal nations could have bribed him, many a time he would have been ſtolen from us; but he eſteemed it the greateſt honor, to be the defence of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. American freedom, and independence were written on his heart, and he importunately breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a deſire for them in all his devotions to heaven. Under the auſpices of this great war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, who was formed by the providence of GOD to defend his country, the war was ended, and America ranked among the nations. He who might have been a monarch, retired to his own Vernon, unclothed of all authority, to enjoy the bliſs of being a free private citizen. This was a ſtrange ſight, and gave a new triumph to human virtue—a triumph that hath never been exceeded in the hiſtory of the world, except it was by his ſecond receſs, which was from the preſidency of the United States.</p>
            <p>After the revolutionary war was ended, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſoon taught that freedom cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038577_0022_10129686F2ABDCE0"/>
without government. Anarchy became more dangerous than Britain with all her hoſts had been before, and we were near deſpair. The impreſſive feelings of danger, again led the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to aſk the aid of General WASHINGTON, and he greatly aſſiſted in forming a conſtitution which we hope will be perpetual. By the voice of the people, he became once and again the Preſident of the union, and continued thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, in his opinion, the complete organization of the civil ſtate, permitted him to retire a ſecond time into private life, giving in all reſpects a new example to men and the world, that a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind finds its higheſt delights, in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſolitude and in beholding others happy.</p>
            <p>A third time danger menaced his country—a third time his country called—he heard his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens and his children and took his ſword, and bid them truſt in GOD, and keep his laws, and the ordinances of a good government and they ſhould be ſafe. When lo! the experiment became too great for humanity to exhibit any longer, and he who rules the univerſe, and hath great men and nations in his hand hath removed him by death.</p>
            <p>Do not all our civil rulers ſay, Know ye not that a great man and a prince hath died in Iſrael to day.—Do not all the pious look after him heavenward, and ſay, My father, my father, the chariots of Iſrael, and the horſemen thereof.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038577_0023_1012968893A9AD18"/>
—Ye rulers of the civil ſtate, ye defenders of the land, know ye, that it will be no evidence againſt the firmneſs of your minds to weep this day. Ye young defenders of your country; ye virgins the offspring of thoſe who fought the American battles, weep with your parents.</p>
            <p>Concerning the final exit of our great and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted friend, private information thus ſays, That he died with one days illneſs, <q>that his great and good mind, remained unhurt and unclouded thro the cloſing ſcene, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his ſenſe of its near approach, and ſaid it had no terrors for him.</q> Thus may all who have ſerved under him, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the LORD die.</p>
            <p>I have only a word more to ſay to you my brethren, by way of improvement.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Let us praiſe and adore the providence of GOD, for raiſing up ſuch an inſtrument to ſave this country from oppreſſion. It was the work of GOD's moſt gracious providence, and marvellous in our eyes; let us now with reverence adore the ſovereignty, which hath withdrawn the gift. Let us remember to adore that Providence which our departed FATHER adored, and taught us to truſt. Let us keep far away from thoſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of infidelity and atheiſm which he abhored, and which in the preſent aera of nations, is both the cauſe and the means, whereby a holy GOD is puniſhing an ungrateful world.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:038577_0024_1012968C9CC37EB0"/>
2ndly. Let us ſeek that public ſpirit in our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and practice, which guided him, ſo hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orably thro life and brought him to ſo peaceful an end. You my hearers, are the moſt of you private men, but if you fear GOD; if you honor his government, and keep his precepts; if you love the ſtate and continue to maintain a right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous government, you may die unclouded, and ſay death has no terrors for you.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Under this bereaving event, there are but two grounds of conſolation remain for us; the LORD who hath been our GOD, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of our country is ſtill on the throne; and he hath prepared an ADAMS to ſucceed our WASHINGTON; for we already ſee the ſpirit of ELIJAH reſting on ELISHA.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. Let us ever remember the political opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of our deceaſed father. He was an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can both in principle and feeling, as well as by birth. While he loved all men, and reſpected the rights of all nations, his moſt ardent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was for the houſehold of his country. And as his enlightened life drew towards a cloſe, he had a moſt deep ſenſe, that the people whom he had ſaved by his ſword, could be preſerved in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſperity, only by a firm adherence to the principles of their own government, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their fathers.</p>
            <p>May the LORD be with the American ſtates to preſerve them. AMEN.</p>

               <head>SKETCHES OF THE LIFE OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</head>
               <p>GEORGE WASHINGTON was born on the 11th of February A. D. 1732 O. S. His perſon was conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly above the middle ſize, but of a dignified and graceful form. His countenance exhibited ſtrong marks of that fortitude and wiſdom which always ſhone in his character; and at once ſpoke the hero and the man. At an early period of life, he was thought worthy of the confidence of his native ſtate, and while only twenty-one years of age was, at his own requeſt, ſent on a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult and important miſſion. During the diſpute which originat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the war which concluded in 1763, the French, pretending to claim the territory in the vicinity of the river Ohio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> committed many acts of hoſtility and violence upon the Britiſh ſubjects by erecting forts in their dominions, and ſeizing their perſons and ſending them priſoners to Canada. Complaints being made to the governor of Virginia of theſe outrages, he determined to ſend ſome ſuitable perſon to the French commandant near the Ohio, to demand of him the reaſon of his conduct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and inſiſt upon his evacuating the fort lately built in that quarter. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral WASHINGTON, then being a major, offered his ſervice, which was thankfully accepted. The diſtance to be travelled was more than 400 miles, and one half of the rout lay through a wilderneſs, inhabited only by ſavages. Taking proviſion on his back, he ſat out, attended by a ſingle companion. When he arrived and delivered his meſſage, the officer refuſed to comply with the demand, and claimed the whole country as belonging to the king his maſter.</p>
               <p>The Ohio company could not brook this diſappointment of their hopes, and prevailed on the Britiſh government to inſtruct the colonies to oppoſe with arms theſe encroachments on their territory. In the year 1754 Virginia ſent Col. WASHINGTON with the command of 300 men towards the Ohio. An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement between them and a party of the French took place, in which the latter were defeated. In conſequence of this event, the commandant of the French marched againſt Col. WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON with 900 men, partly Indians, and attacked him. He made a brave defence, behind a ſmall unfiniſhed entrenchment, which he called fort Neceſſity, and obliged the French officer to grant him honorable terms of capitulation.</p>
               <p>The hoſtile conduct of the French produced, both in England and America, the reſolution of driving them out of the whole territory claimed by the Engliſh. General Braddock was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ordered from Ireland to Virginia with two regiments, and was there joined by as many Americans as made in the whole 2200 men. General Braddock was a brave man, but with a ſupercilious contempt of the Americans, he greatly ſlighted the Virginia officers and men. Col. WASHINGTON who then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038577_0026_1012969102982B58"/>
the Virginia troops, begged his permiſſion to march be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and with the Americans, who were acquainted with that kind of ſervice, ſcour the woods; but was refuſed. The General puſhed on incautiouſly with 1400 men, and fell into an ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade of French and Indians, by whom he was defeated and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded on the 9th day of June 1755. The Britiſh were thrown into confuſion, but the Americans more accuſtomed to ſavage warfare, were not much diſconcerted. They contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued unbroken under Col. WASHINGTON, and by covering the retreat of the Britiſh, prevented their being entirely cut off. Ever ſince this battle was fought, General WASHINGTON has had the credit of ſaving the remains of that unfortunate corps by his maſterly addreſs and good conduct.</p>
               <p>After the peace of Paris, in 1763, Gen. WASHINGTON re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to his eſtate, where with great induſtry and ſucceſs he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the arts of peace. Since this time there ſeems to be no hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical monument of his public life until he was returned a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the ſtate of Virginia to the memorable congreſs of 1774. This venerable band of patriots and ſtateſmen might glory in reckoning among their number the ſage and hero of America.</p>
               <p>On the 15th day of June 1775, he was unanimouſly choſen, by the continental congreſs, to fill the important and dangerous ſtation of commander in chief of the forces raiſed, or to be raiſed for the defence of American Liberty. His election pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the uncommon ſpectacle of a man raiſed to the higheſt honors his country could beſtow, without exciting either compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition or envy. On the day following, the Preſident of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs announced to General WASHINGTON his appointment; to which he, ſtanding in his place, replied—</p>

               <p>To do juſtice to that part of the life of General WASHINGTON

which is included within the time of the American war, would require a detail of all the principal events which took place in that hard ſtruggle for liberty, and would greatly exceed the limits of theſe ſketches. The evacuation of Boſton, the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly retreat from Long-Iſland and New-York, croſſing the North river and the retreat through New-Jerſey, the brilliant coup-de-main at Trenton, the more ſplendid affair at Prince-town, the battle of Germantown, the battle of Monmouth, the capture of Stoney-point, theſe are a few of the events which were directed by his wiſdom, or effected by his arm; and are but reſting places in his glorious career through this bloody con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict. During the progreſs of the war the confidence of the Congreſs was, on many occaſions, manifeſted to him, by votes of thanks and applauſe, and by medals ordered to be preſented to him in commemoration of particular inſtances of heroiſm and generalſhip. So great indeed was their truſt in his abilities and virtue, that from time to time they increaſed his powers as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief until he was little leſs than univerſal dictator.—In no inſtance can he be accuſed of abuſing thoſe powers; and the time arriving when they were no longer neceſſary for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, he cheerfully reſigned them.</p>
               <p>The event which finiſhed the American war and added the laſt wreath to the brow of WASHINGTON, was the capture of Lord Cornwallis with 7000 Britiſh troops, at Yorktown in the month of October 1781. This ſucceſs was gained by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate valor of the combined troops of America and France; but the wiſdom of the plan and energy of the execution muſt be attributed to him. On this triumphant occaſion his heart was filled with joy and gratitude to heaven for his wonderful ſucceſs. A ſhort extract from his orders on this great day, will evince that amidſt all his proſperity, he was not unmindful of that GOD whoſe directing hand had pointed out to him the path of glory. "Divine ſervice ſhall be performed to-morrow in all the brigades and diviſions. The commander in chief, recommends that all the troops that are not upon duty, do aſſiſt at it with a ſerious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment and that ſenſibility of heart, which the recollection of the ſurpriſing and particular interpoſition of Divine Providence in our favor claims."</p>
               <p>Every one knows that towards the cloſe of the war our troops were unpaid and the credit of the United States at its loweſt ebb. At this period an attempt was made to inflame the minds of the officers and ſoldiers, by a ſeditious and artful publication, inviting them while they had arms in their hands, to redreſs their own grievances. Perhaps in no period of the war was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the commander in chief, ſo politic, ſo magnanimous, ſo worthy of himſelf, as at this intereſting and alarming criſis. No ſooner were theſe mutinous and inflammatory papers ſcattered through the camp; than the General convened the officers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and in a ſpeech well calculated to calm their minds, he
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038577_0028_101296969FF53A88"/>
pledged himſelf to uſe all his faculties and influence in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and urged them to rely on the future juſtice of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He conjured them "as they valued their honor, as they reſpected the rights of humanity and as they regarded the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and national character of America, to expreſs their utmoſt deteſtation of the man, who was attempting to open the flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of civil diſcord, and deluge their riſing empire with blood." His attempt was ſucceſsful; and the officers and ſoldiers return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their duty and conſented to wait for the tardy juſtice of their country.</p>
               <p>At the return of peace, General WASHINGTON repaired to Annapolis, where Congreſs was in ſeſſion, for the purpoſe of reſigning his command. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Happy in the confirmation of our independence and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, and pleaſed with the opportunity afforded the United States of becoming a reſpectable nation, I reſign with ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the appointment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I accepted with diffidence; a diffidence in my abilities to accompliſh ſo arduous a taſk, which however was ſuperſeded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cauſe, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the ſupreme power of the Union, and the patronage of Heaven.</p>

               <p>From this time General WASHINGTON reſided at his retreat at Mount Vernon, until the deranged ſtate of our public affairs, and the total inefficiency of our confederation, had convinced the leading characters of our nation that a new form of government was neceſſary. At this time a convention was called, which met in Philadelphia in the year 1787. To this convention Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral WASHINGTON was ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>In the year 1789, he was unanimouſly choſen Preſident of the United States. No ſooner was he informed that he was again called to exchange his happy retirement for the ſtormy ſcenes of public life, than he prepared to meet the wiſhes of his country; and in a few days arrived at New-York. Here he accepted his appointment of Preſident of the United States, and informed both houſes of Congreſs, that he ſhould recline any compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his ſervices—in the following manner; "When I was firſt honored with a call into the ſervice of my country, then on the eve of an arduous ſtruggle for its liberties, the light in which I contemplated my duty required that I ſhould renounce every pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary compenſation. From this reſolution I have in no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance departed. And being ſtill under the impreſſions which produced it, I muſt decline as inapplicable to myſelf, any ſhare in the perſonal emoluments which may be indiſpenſably included in a permanent proviſion for the executive department; and muſt accordingly pray that pecuniary eſtimates for the ſtation in which I am placed, may, during my continuance in it, be limited to ſuch actual expenditures, as the public good may be thought to require."</p>
               <p>In the year 1793 the time for which his firſt appointment was made being expired, he was again elected; and having a ſecond time officiated in the character of Preſident of the United States, he choſe to retire from the public ſcene and ſpend the remainder of his days in rural quiet and domeſtic tranquillity. He pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his intention in an addreſs to the people of the United States, which, while it breathes the pure ſpirit of benevolence and patriotiſm, recommends to them in the moſt winning and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive language the cauſe of virtue and religion.</p>
               <p>After his farewel for a ſecond time, to all public honors, he retired to his favorite ſeat at Mount Vernon, where he reſided in the character of a private citizen, until the proſpect of a rupture with France turned the eyes of the government towards him as their only refuge during the impending ſtorm. His cheerful acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence in accepting the office of Lieutenant-General of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican forces, at a time when his age and former ſervices might have juſtified a refuſal, will long be remembered with ſentiments of affection and gratitude, by a generous people.</p>
