            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Mr. Pyke and Mr. Franklyn, who had been aſſigned, were then heard for the priſoner; but they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for no witneſſes. The Attorney General made a very able reply, in which he commented on the priſoner's indiſcretion in attempting his own defence, and clearly refuted all the pretexts he had ſet up, to the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every body. The evidence was then ſummed up by the Chief Juſtice, who obſerved, that moſt of the overt acts charged, which were fourteen in number had been proved by three or four witneſſes; many of whom (which was rarely the caſe in proſecutions of

by Adet the late French mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter at Philadelphia, to carry letters to ſome diſaffected gentlemen, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to revolt againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the province, with a promiſe of being aſſiſted very ſhortly with a naval force. He was charged alſo with commiſſions for thoſe who were to take the lead; ſeveral of whom are apprehended and now in confinement. On the 21ſt of July he was brought from priſon to the Grand Square, the whole garriſon were under arms—two executioners attended,—he declared that he was innocent of any attempt to diſturb the peace of the government, and did not know that the letters he had been employed to carry for Adet were of that tendency; he prayed about five minutes and then gave the ſignal that he was ready. He was drawn up the gallows by a pulley, and let down again in a few minutes, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther executioner proceeded to quarter him, which began by cutting a large inciſion in his left ſide and taking out his heart, which was thrown into a fire kindled under the gallows for the purpoſe; he was then cut into four quarters in a ſhocking and

Thus fell an unfortunate man, a dupe to French artifice. He was about 30 years of age, a native of Airſhire in Scotland.</p>
