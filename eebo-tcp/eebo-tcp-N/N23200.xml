            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>LET the ſons and daughters of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction receive comfort from hope.—The motion of the ſunbeams on the wave, is not more uncertain than the condition of human life: miſery, therefore, has much to hope, and happineſs much to fear; but vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue has always a reſource in Providence, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improves the bleſſings, but mitigates the evils of life.</p>
               <p>In a pleaſant valley of Meſopotamia, on the banks of the Irwan lived Solyman, the ſon of Ardavan the ſage. He was early inſtructed in all the learning of the eaſt; but as his underſtanding opened he grew weary of the labours of ſtudy, and thirſted only for the knowledge of mankind. With much importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity he prevailed on his father to permit him to travel. "My ſon," ſaid Ardavan, "let not your curioſity interrupt your happineſs: all that nature can give you is in the valley of Irwan, here you are cheriſhed by the eye of affection, and indulged with all the bounties of the eternal ſun. Travel is often danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and always inconvenient: your knowledge of men may be purchaſed by experiencing their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, their cruelty and their pride; the unſuſpecting innocence of your heart will expoſe you to the deſigns of the ſelfiſh, and the inſolence of the vain; you will
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030671_0003_0FE85B3BB9BEF968"/>
wander from place to place, only for amuſement; as your heart can have no connections that time or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt have rendered dear to you, you will be little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by any thing you ſee: and, what is more than all, your virtue will be endangered; when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the univerſal prevalence of vice, when your eye is attracted by the flowery paths in which ſhe ſeems to tread, you will find it difficult to withſtand the force of example, and the blandiſhments of pleaſure." Solyman humbled himſelf, and replied—"Prince of the ſages that dwell between the rivers, let your ear be patient to the words of youth. Can Ardavan doubt the integrity of the heart, which his precepts have formed to virtue; or fear that Solyman ſhould become the ſlave of vice? I am not a ſtranger to the manners of men, though I have mixed but little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; nor am I unacquainted with the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations to which I ſhall be expoſed, nor unprepared to withſtand them. Travel may be attended with ſome inconvenience, but it has many advantages: next to the knowledge of ourſelves, moſt valuable is the knowledge of nature; and this is to be acquired only by attending her through the variety of her works; the more we behold of theſe, the more our ideas are enlarged and extended; and the nobler and more worthy conceptions we muſt entertain of that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er who is the parent of univerſal being."</p>
               <p>"My ſon," ſaid Ardavan, "if you are determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to travel, let your ear attend to the inſtruction of age. Move not one pace from the valley of Irwan, if your heart rely not on the Eternal Providence; it is that confidence alone which muſt ſupport you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the poſſible contingencies of diſtreſs: O let it not depart from you; it is the ſovereign antidote to the evils of live! the day is not lighted up in vain, let it not paſs without the practice of virtue; dare not to behold the everlaſting ſun go down, if thou haſt waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his light in idleneſs, or vanity: ignorance, miſery, or want, will always afford thee the means of benifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:030671_0004_0FE85B3D49D0B5E8"/>"May that Immortal Being, whoſe eye is over all his creatures, ſave thee from folly and from vice! may his hand direct thee in the hour of negligence, and his ſpirit guide thee through the maze of error! When thy mind ſhall be enriched with the knowledge of his works, may he reſtore thee, more virtuous, to the valley of Irwan, to the arms of thy aged father! and may he forgive this tear, which proceeds not from a diſtruſt of his Providence, but falls for the loſs of Solyman.</p>

               <p>THE morning was ſpread upon the mountains, and Solyman prepared to depart: but firſt proſtrating himſelf towards the ſun, he thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed that glorious luminary—"Incomparable, and everlaſting! thou that lighteſt up a thouſand worlds, and extendeſt thy protecting power to the minuteſt parts of nature! let thy univerſal eye look with favor upon Solyman. When I wander over the waſtes of deſolation, may thy cheerful rays comfort and ſupport me! when I go into the cities of men, mayeſt thou ſtill look upon me; teach me to diſcover the dark deſigns of malignity, and to unfold the intricacies of fraud! ſo mayeſt thou riſe with ſevenfold luſtre over the waves of Indus; ſo mayeſt thou be adorned by thoſe ſavage nations who experience thy goodneſs without acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment!"

               <p>When Solyman had finiſhed his devotions, he paſſed over the Tigris into the kingdom of Perſia.</p>
               <p>There is ſome ſecret attraction in the place where we have paſſed the cheerful innocence of childhood, that holds our heart to it during the remaining part of life. No ſooner had Solyman aſcended an eminence that gave him a retroſpective view of the valley of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wan, than he turned his eye on his native fields, and gazed for ſome time with a kind of penſive compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. "Happy ſcenes," ſaid he, "where I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the everlaſting ſun ſo often riſe and ſet! yonder is the grove where I repoſed at noon; and that is the hill where I muſed at eve. In yon manſion, I firſt drew the breath of Heaven; and there perhaps Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davan may yet be weeping for my departure."</p>

                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:030671_0006_0FE85B4606E63088"/>The gentle heart of Solyman thus indulged itſelf a while, till the declining day called upon him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>

               <p>WHEN he had reached the foot of Taurus, the ſhadows of evening fell from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; he, therefore, ſought to repoſe himſelf in the village of Abdat: but as he was advancing towards it, he was ſtopped by the exclamation of ſorrow, that proceeded from an adjacent wood. As he was in hopes of relieving ſome diſtreſs, he ſcrupled not to draw near enough to liſten; and ſoon diſcovered, that the perſons he heard ſpeaking, were two lovers, who had ſtolen a ſecret interview, before their final ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The heart of Solyman had never felt the paſſion of love; and he was therefore the more curious to ſee the effects of it. But how great was his aſtoniſhment, when, as he approached the place from whence the voices came he beheld the lover lying in all the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſorrow, at the feet of his weeping miſtreſs! "Immortal Power!" ſaid he, "I have been told that love was the beſt of thy gifts; is this miſerable, this painful ſight, a proof of it? Behold that wretched youth, how his heart labors and ſtruggles under its oppreſſion; while the amiable maiden, who ſeems to be the cauſe of his miſery, hangs over him in tears and ſilence, as if incapable of relieving him! Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, what agonies! Reaſon will be driven from her ſeat. Ha! nature gives place; he faints!"</p>
               <p>Solyman, perceiving his aſſiſtance was now become neceſſary, ruſhed into the thicket, and raiſed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy lover from the earth. At length his ſenſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; but his grief, which had before been ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely violent, was changed into gloomy ſtupidity.— Solyman, however, by the ſoothing ſounds of pity,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030671_0007_0FE85B4D103114A0"/>
awoke his attention, and by gentle importunity drew from him the cauſe of his diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>"Stranger," ſaid the youth, "whoever thou art thine appearance entitles thee to regard, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion thou haſt ſhown me merits my confidence. Thou now beholdeſt the moſt unhappy of men. That lady, at whoſe feet I ſo lately lay inſenſible, is the daughter of a mercenary wretch, who has ſold her to the Khan of Bukharia: and to-morrow ſhe is to be conveyed to him without expoſtulation or reprieve."</p>
               <p>"What!" replied Solyman, "is it poſſible that any thing can induce a parent to make his child miſerable! I was not ignorant of the depravity of man; but I thought the affections of nature could not have been overcome. Yet, if it is ſo, can there be any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the child to take the portion of miſery that her parent holds out to her? The obligation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to parents, can only be founded in gratitude; and where no favor is ſhown, no gratitude can be due. It is impoſſible that, in any circumſtances, you ſhould be more miſerable; but it is very poſſible, that you may be happier. Fly, while the moments of liberty remain: and let not thoſe hearts which Heaven has formed for each other, be ſeparated by man. The roof of Ardavan has always been a refuge to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in diſtreſs; I will myſelf conduct you to the valley of Irwan, where my father's venerable charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the retired ſituation of his abode, will ſecure you from detection; and I ſhall rejoice to be the means of delivering you from miſery."</p>
               <p>This offer was too intereſting to be refuſed. The lovers put themſelves under the conduct of Solyman; and he now repaſſed the roads he had travelled by the light of the ſun, with ſuperior pleaſure, even in the gloom of night; ſo delightful is beneficence to a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous mind!</p>
               <p>When the morning began to appear they had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the banks of the Tigris. "It will not be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry," ſaid ſolyman, "that I ſhould attend you farther:
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030671_0008_0FE85B4E9A74C038"/>
yonder is the valley of Irwan, and the houſe of Arda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van. To know that you are unhappy, will be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient motive for him to receive you; and your ſtory will procure you his protection. I will now take leave of you, becauſe I would not again take leave of my father. Tell him that I recommend you to his care; he will rejoice to hear that Solyman has been the means of your happineſs; but tell him not, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the banks of the Tigris." Having thus parted with the lovers, he proceeded on his journey, and in five days arrived at Iſpahan.</p>
               <p>The beauty and magnificence of that extenſive city engaged his attention for many days: he was now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed at the ſtupendous effects of induſtry, and now delighted by the elegance of art. But by theſe he thought himſelf rather amuſed than inſtructed: and he perceived that day after day departed from him, without being diſtinguiſhed either by the acquiſition of knowledge or the practice of virtue; he, therefore frequented the places of public reſort, and endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to form ſuch connections as were moſt likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote both.</p>

               <p>AMONG thoſe whoſe converſation he found moſt inſtructing and entertaining, he was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly fond of an Engliſh merchant, who had reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome time at Iſpahan, and ſpoke the language of the country: the merchant alſo perceiving in Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man a ſuperior underſtanding, and a benevolent heart, was delighted with his company, and cultivated his friendſhip. They frequently met; and their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation generally turning on the manners and purſuits of men, they mutually gratified each other by accounts of their different countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:030671_0009_0FE85B558D5A7118"/>"You," ſaid Solyman, "have enjoyed the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which I am ſtill to procure. You have ſeen many different parts of the world, and can form a collective idea of its inhabitants: your commercial engagements muſt have led you much into the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts and deſigns of men; and you muſt conſequently be well acquainted with the prevailing propenſities of the heart. But I ſhould be particularly obliged to you for an account of your own country, of which I have yet had but an imperfect deſcription."</p>
               <p>"The difference of men," ſaid the merchant, "lies only in their complexion and manners: their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are the ſame, in all ages, and in all climates; and ſelf-intereſt is the prevailing principle from Indus to the Thames. I am not however ſuch a ſchool phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, as to think the whole human ſpecies ſhould come under this concluſion: I have experienced the delights of friendſhip, and the conſolations of benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, where intereſt was no motive; I have even known many, who have contributed to remove the miſeries of their fellow creatures, though by the dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inution of their own fortune.—That excellent, that truly uſeful ſpirit of munificence, in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner characterizes my countrymen. Were you, my friend, in the metropolis of Great Britain, you would behold ſpacious edifices erected for helpleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence; and find the ſame ſkill and care employed for the health and the lives of the poor, that the moſt affluent circumſtances can procure for the rich."</p>
               <p>"But munificence is not the only ornament that diſtinguiſhes my country: there, too, dwell liberty and juſtice; liberty, that, however ſtrange it may ſeem to you, delights in the protection of a monarch; and juſtice, which he cauſes to be adminiſtered without partiality. The greateſt baſſa in Great Britain can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not invade either the life or the property of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſubject with impunity; he is equally obnoxious to the laws, and would ſuffer indiſcriminately with the moſt obſcure malefactor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="unknown:030671_0010_0FE85B5718E38D30"/>"This general ſecurity of property and life excites an unwearied ſpirit of induſtry, and diſperſes the ſons of commerce over the remoteſt regions of the earth. Hence, my friend, we viſit the towers of Iſpahan, and the gulphs of Baſſora; our ſails are ſtretched from the moſt diſtant iſlands of the Atlantic to the ſhores of Japan: and London is ſupplied with all the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of nature, and all the labors of art."</p>
               <p>"You give me," ſaid Solyman, "a very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and a very pleaſing idea of your country. But will not commerce, as it enriches the people, corrupt their manners. Will unbounded affluence produce neither riot nor debauchery, vanity nor pride? The inhabitants of Great Britain may be more ſplendid and luxurious; but the dwellers in Meſopotamia are, perhaps, happier, in proportion as they are more inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: for Ardavan my father, has frequently told me, that wealth corrupts the heart of man."</p>
               <p>"All the good things of life," anſwered the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, "are complicated with evils. If wealth be not deſirable becauſe it may lead us into luxury, or inflame us with pride; no more would the ſanguine cheerfulneſs of health, leſt it ſhould betray us into li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs. There are, it is to be feared, many whoſe manners are depraved by riches, but, there are, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, many who employ them in the diffuſion of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, or the relief of indigence.</p>
               <p>"Theſe," ſaid Solyman, "are glorious ends, and would almoſt excite me to turn merchant, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of wealth. But give me ſome account of the literature of your country."</p>
               <p>"Of that," replied the merchant, "I am ſcarce a competent judge, the greateſt part of my time having been employed in commercial ſtudies. I am not, however, wholly unacquainted with it; for I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thought, that a merchant ſhould not neglect the accompliſhments of a gentleman. The preſent ſtate of literature in Great Britain will be ſeen beſt by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the performances of the learned in their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030671_0011_0FE85C1485995980"/>
claſſes. We have but few hiſtorians of real merit; either their ſtyle is ſlovenly and unharmonious, or their matter undigeſted and confuſed; they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the tools of a faction, or the ſlaves of a bookſeller. But I have had the pleaſure of hearing, ſince I came to Iſpahan, that the hiſtories of England and Scotland, the two diviſions of Great Britain, have lately been written with conſiderable ſpirit, accuracy, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance. As to the hiſtories of other countries, which have been publiſhed in Great Britian, they are ſuch mere compilations that they deſerve not to be called the labors of art."</p>
               <p>"From this account of your hiſtorians," ſaid Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "I cannot entertain any great idea of them; but what are your orators?"—"As to rhetorical wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting," anſwered the merchant, we have many that are truly excellent; ſpirited and elevated in ſentiment, in language harmonious and correct: but the powers of compoſition are rendered inefficacious by a ſpiritleſs pronunciation. The art of public ſpeaking, however important in itſelf, ſeems entirely to be neglected; and the orator pronounces his diſcourſe from the roſtrum with as little feeling himſelf, and as little influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his audience, as if he were reading the newſpaper of the day."—"Then I ſuppoſe," ſaid Solyman, "that your orators ſpeak on unaffecting, or unintereſting ſubjects." "That is not the caſe," replied the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant; "the ſubjects they treat are of the laſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: the duties we owe the Supreme Being, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of his providence, the eternal obligations of morality, the charms of virtue, and the delightful exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of juſtice, mercy, and charity."—"Holy Mithra!" interrupted Solyman, "can the ſpeakers be unaffected while they are treating theſe ſubjects? Do they then think them of that importance they really are; or do your teachers diſbelieve and diſregard their own doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines; or are they unconcerned what effect they may have upon the people?" "It would be uncharitable," ſaid the merchant, "to admit generally any of theſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030671_0012_0FE85C161205B560"/>
ſuppoſitions. Their unanimated and unawakening manner of ſpeaking may proceed from innocent cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which thoſe you mention are not."</p>
               <p>"I take it for granted," ſaid Solyman, "that as you have orators, at leaſt in point of compoſition, you have alſo poets; for rhetoric and poetry are nearly allied. Beſides I have been informed that every country has its poets; and that even on the frozen mountains of the north, the hardy inh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>tants open their mouths to ſing." "The love of harmony," replied the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, "is in man a natural paſſion. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing metrical and numerous in his motions, his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and his words, and he has always endeavored to reduce the laſt to a kind of poetical meaſure, even where the art of writing was unknown or unpractiſed. The art of poetry in Great Britain, has of late years been brought to great perfection; the language of the country is both nervous and harmonious, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to expreſs the tender and the ſublime, in both which ſpecies of writing we have poets that have nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er been excelled. Though the Engliſh are, in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, of a leſs ſprightly turn than their neighbors the French; yet, in the active powers of imagination, in the flights of fancy, and the ſtrains of humor, their writings are by no means inferior. Hence the Engliſh poetry is not only harmonious, but ſentimental and pictureſque, abounding with ſtrong images and lively deſcriptions. In ſhort, my countrymen have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every different ſpecies of poetry, and have excelled in each."</p>
               <p>"The account you give me of your poetry," ſaid Solyman, "makes me very deſirous to learn your lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. There is no ſpecies of writing that gives me equal pleaſure: I caught the enthuſiaſm from nature, from the harmony and ſymmetry of her works. If you who have ſo long been accuſtomed to the elegance of the Engliſh, can bear a ſpecimen of the Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian poetry, I will repeat you a performance of my own."</p>

               <p>IN ſocial intercourſe the merchant paſſed many days with Solyman, and while he gratified his curioſity, engaged his affection. Being ſuddenly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by buſineſs to the court of Baſſora, he came one
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030671_0014_0FE85C1D51266180"/>
morning to take a final leave; but the traveller was too much attached to his friend, to ſuffer any thing but neceſſity to part them. "Permit me," ſaid he, "to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you on your preſent expedition. I have not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to myſelf any particular rout, but travel as occaſion or inclination leads me; I am ſenſible I ſhall gain more from your experience and obſervation, than I can from my own." This offer was too agreeable to the merchant, not to be eagerly embraced; and, after the neceſſary preparations, they ſet out from Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahan, and met the morning on the mountains of Arvan.</p>
               <p>The ſun appeared above the horizon, and Solyman proſtrated himſelf in the profoundeſt adoration. When he aroſe from his devotions, he advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his fellow traveller, with a look of kindneſs mixed with pity and concern. The merchant under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him: but as he was unwilling to controvert the principles of his religion, he made no apology for his conduct during the devotions of Solyman.</p>
               <p>The mild morning light which was diffuſed over the vallies and ſtreams, the various beauty of the meadows, the regular diſpoſition of bloſſomed hedge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, the ſoothing murmurs of bees at their early la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and the full concert of the feathered creation, drew their converſation on the univerſal beneficence of nature. "I feel," ſaid Solyman, a delight, which I can neither account for nor deſcribe. Theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains gilded with the rays of the orient ſun, thoſe paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vallies that ſhame the rich carpets of Perſia, yon diſtant waters which gleam with the ſhifting effulgence of light, the general buſy voice of joy and activity in the animal creation, conſpire to fill my heart with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible pleaſure."</p>
               <p>"That pleaſure," replied the merchant, "I believe, proceeds from ſympathy: it is ſcarce poſſible, unleſs you have ſome peculiar cauſe of miſery, not to be pleaſed when you ſee every thing around you happy. On the contrary, if you go into the manſions of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, it will be impoſſible to withſtand the infection of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030671_0015_0FE85C1EDA33FE18"/>
it. The God of nature ſeems to have given us theſe ſympathetic feelings, to link our affections in the great chain of ſociety: hence, ſocial virtue is not left to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ſolely no the moral will, but is founded on the principles of our nature.</p>
               <p>But the object of your adoration is ſo profuſe of his favors, that I ſhould now be glad to find ſome conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhade. I think, I diſcover a cave on the ſouthern declivity of the mountain; let us retire to it during the heat of the day."</p>
               <p>As they were advancing towards the cave, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a beaten path leading directly from it to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant rivulet: this made them apprehenſive that it might be the habitation of ſome wild beaſt, that had worn the path by conſtantly going to drink at the ſtream: but their fears were ſoon removed upon the appearance of an aged hermit, advancing ſlowly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the rivulet with an earthen pitcher. At ſight of the travellers, he haſted to his abode with all the feeble precipitancy of age; they agrees not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb him, and only took advantage of the rock which projected over his cell to ſhelter themſelves from the ſun; but they had not long continued in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before the hermit, perceiving them to be inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive travellers invited them into his cave.</p>
               <p>"You will excuſe," ſaid the hoary ſage, "the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of years: these mountains are not ſecure from the ravage of human ferocity; and these grey hairs would be no defence from the wanton cruelty of man. I have ſuffered ſo much from my own ſpecies, that I have at laſt forſaken their ſociety: I thought it better to give up the convenience of it, than to bear the evils; and I have long lived in this ſolitary cave on nothing more than what uncultivated nature would afford me."—"Thoſe ſufferings," ſaid Solyman, "muſt, indeed, have been extraordinary, that could make you give up one of the greateſt advantages of life, the ſocial intercourſe of your fellow creatures."— "The narratives of age," replied the hermit, "are
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030671_0016_0FE85C2649549490"/>
ſeldom agreeable to youth; but as inſtruction can be gained only from experience, you will do wiſely to learn it from the misfortunes of Abbas.</p>
               <p>I was born to a competent fortune in the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince of Lureſtan: but being early left an orphan, my affairs came under the cognizance of a juſticiary court, which the members of it call the court of equity; but ſo equitable were they with regard to me, that they claimed two parts of my little fortune for their care of the third."—"Would to God, that were never the caſe in Great Britain!" interrupted the merchant. "But proceed." Though I had ſuch in early and convincing proof of the treachery and rapacity of mankind; yet, as I had always exerciſed the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent virtues myſelf, I could not think others totally devoid of them; and at my three and twentieth year being inclined to travel, I without ſcruple entruſted the remains of my fortune with a perſon whom I had long known and reſpected; a perſon, Holy Allah! who lifted his hands to thee; but I had not been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from Lureſtan more than three moons, when he pretended a commiſſion to diſpoſe of my effects, and immediately left the place. Upon my return there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the province, I found neither friend nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and being bred to no buſineſs, I was reduced to the moſt diſtreſsful ſtate of indigence. I applied, however, not without hopes of redreſs or relief, to a perſon of power and eminence, whom I had often heard ſpeak of his friendſhip with my father. After long and frequent attendance, I was admitted to an interview: I laid open my diſtreſs to him with that kind of eloquence which the miſeries we ſuffer from the treachery of others always ſuggeſts; and which however unaffected it may be to indifferent perſons, utters its complaints with dignity and reſentment. I was heard half way through my ſtory, and diſmiſſed with the following reply: "It is not neceſſary, young man, to proceed with your complaints; I perceive you have been abuſed, and I am ſorry for you; But
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030671_0017_0FE85B5FA89E1240"/>
that ſhall not be the only proof of my regard for you; I will give you a little advice: you ſhould never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ſo much on the benevolence or integrity of any human being, as to truſt him with your fortune or your life." Thus ended my hopes from the friend of my father; whoſe benevolence extended no farther, than to inſtruct me how to ſecure the fortune that was ſtolen, and to preſerve the life which I wiſhed to looſe.</p>
               <p>I had now no choice, but to enter as a common ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, into the army of the Sophia. I had always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in martial exerciſes, and was expert in the uſe of arms; my dexterity and addreſs drew upon me the attention of my officers; and in a ſhort time obtained a ſmall commiſſion. I had now almoſt forgotten my miſeries, and embraced my new ſituation with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and hope; but Fortune, who had for a while ceaſed to perſecute me as below her notice, as if ſhe had been indignant at my ſatisfaction, and jealous of my proſpects, now renewed and redoubled her ſeverity.</p>
               <p>"My commanding officer had a daughter of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary beauty, and an uncommon capacity. Zara was the object of univerſal admiration: but ſhe had ſet her heart on the unfortunate Abbas. The firſt moment I beheld her, I diſcovered in her looks the moſt tender and affectionate regard for me, which I imputed to her compaſſion for my misfortunes; though at the ſame time I wiſhed, not knowing why, that it might proceed from another cauſe.—She aſked me for the ſtory of my life: I told it in the plaineſt and moſt pathetic manner; yet, when I had finiſhed ſhe deſired me to repeat it. From this moment I had done with peace; her infectious tenderneſs had ſuch an influence upon my heart, that I could think of nothing but Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra; without Zara I was miſerable.

               <p>"The emotions I felt on the receipt of this letter can only be conceived by thoſe who, in the midſt of deſpairing love, have beheld a gleam of hope. The tumult of my heart hurried me to the place appointed, long before the time: I walked backward and forward in the utmoſt confuſion, totally regardleſs of every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject about me; ſometimes raiſing my hands and eyes in the ſudden effuſions of tranſport, and ſometimes ſmiling with the complacency of delight.</p>
               <p>At length the day departed, and Zara came. My heart bounded at her ſight: I was unable to ſpeak, and threw myſelf at her feet. She was alarmed at my exceſſive earneſtneſs and confuſion; but commad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to riſe," "Abbas" ſaid ſhe, "if your confuſion proceed from your modeſt gratitude, reſtrain it, till you find whether I am able to ſerve you; if it ariſes from any other cauſe, I muſt leave you this moment." I entreated ſhe would tell me, to what I was indebted for the happineſs of this interview, and I would be calm and attentive. "My regard for your merit, and my compaſſion for your ſufferings," ſaid ſhe, "make me wiſh to ſerve you. Tell me, Abbas, can I aſſiſt you through the intereſt of my father?" I faltered out my acknowledgments: telling her, that to her I muſt owe all my hopes of future happineſs.</p>
               <p>She left me immediately without reply. The ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of my behavior on the parade before the coming of Zara, had drawn upon me the attention of an officer who was ſecretly her admirer, and who, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through curioſity, or ſuſpicion, though unobſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>ZARA, ignorant of what had paſſed, with her uſual freedom and good nature, began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her compaſſion for the misfortunes of Abbas, talked of his merits, and wiſhed to ſee him preferred.

I vented my grief in broken ejaculations, frequently calling upon the name of Zara, but not once addreſſing myſelf to my attendant. By the evening of the ſecond day, we had advanced forty miles ſouthward from the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince of Lureſtan; when—how ſhall I relate the laſt horrid ſcene of my miſeries!—pardon me! theſe aged eyes have yet a tear left, yet a tear for the memory of Zara!—we were attacked by a band of robbers. My guide was Zara! in her fright ſhe threw off her maſk, and cried "Zara!" Love, rage, fear and vengeance, gave me ſupernatural ſtrength: three of the villians fell by my ſabre; a fourth diſarmed me; and the reſt of the gang carried off Zara."</p>
               <p>At this criſis of his ſtory, the ſpirits of the aged hermit were exhauſted by their own violence; and it was ſome time before he could proceed.</p>
               <p>"You have now" continued he, "heard the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of my misfortunes. When I was recovered of the wounds I had received, I ſpent ſome months in a fruitleſs ſearch of Zara: at laſt, deſpairing to gain any intelligence of her, I tranſmitted an account of the affair to her father; not without hope, that his Power, or his wealth, might be a means of finding her out, and redeeming her: but I was deceived, and had ſoon the mortification to hear, that the unnatural wretch exulted in our misfortunes, and uttered the moſt dreadful imprecations on his only child.</p>
               <p>Deprived of hope, and dejected with melancholy, I could no longer bear the ſociety of mankind: I therefore betook myſelf to theſe ſolitary mountains, where this cell has been my habitation for years, that have paſſed away in unvaried ſorrow; and where you are the firſt of human beings that have heard me tell my tale."</p>

               <p>SOLYMAN expatiated on the ſufferings of Abbas with the moſt tender ſenſibility, and inveighed againſt the baſeneſs of mankind with all the rage of honeſt reſentment. "Surely," ſaid he to the merchant "man is the vileſt of all creatures! in proportion as he excels them in reaſon, he exceeds them in the ability to do miſchief; and being equally cruel, the miſchief he does renders him more deteſtable. Sacred Mithra! why doſt thou lend thy light to the villain and the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant? Were it not for the enjoyment of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, my friend, I ſhould have few inducements to go farther from the valley of Irwan; for poſſibly to ſee more of human life, is only to know more of its crimes and miſeries."</p>
               <p>"From the complicated diſtreſſes of one perſon," replied the merchant, "you draw a partial image of the life of man. But the day declines: let us haſten over theſe mountains, that we may repoſe at night in ſome village of the valley." The travellers took leave of the hermit; and about the cloſe of day arrived at the village of Arden.</p>
               <p>At their entrance they were met by a perſon of a plain dreſs, and a cheerful countenance, who without ceremony, invited them, as travellers, to partake of his houſe and table that night. They accepted his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation; and the merchant, addreſſing himſelf to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman, ſaid, "From the family of this man, you ſhall not only be convinced, that there is both happineſs and virtue in human life; but you ſhall ſee alſo, how much the former depends upon the latter, I have been entertained by him, in travelling this way before: he is never more happy than when he has an opportunity of gratifying his benevolence. His inheritance being much leſſened by the loſſes of his father, who was a merchant, he has but little wealth, except what ariſes from the induſtrious cultivation of a farm, which he purchaſed ten years ago with the chief part of his

fortune; yet he is as liberal to the poor and the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as if he had large poſſeſſions; his known hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and generoſity make his houſe the reſort of the traveller and the indigent; and after he has finiſhed the labors of the day, he is always ready to entertain the one, and relieve the other; hence that ſerene and eaſy cheerfulneſs which you ſee in his countenance. In his family you behold the influence of a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; his wife, whom he loves, and by whom he is beloved with the moſt cordial ſincerity, goes hand in hand with him, not only through their mutual cares, but alſo in the exerciſes of benevolence. It is the principle of her economy, that domeſtic frugality is the ſupport of liberality; and ſhe diſpenſes her own, and her huſbands bounties, with that propriety and eaſy cheerfulneſs, which double their value to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. The children inherit the benevolence of their parents, and learn the exerciſe of it from their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. By and by they will croud about your ſofa, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to ſerve you: you ſhall ſee them preventing your wants and watching your requeſts, with a buſy emulation which ſhall do you the moſt ſervices."</p>
               <p>Solyman liſtened with delight to his deſcription of the villager's family; and haſted, with the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent curioſity, to behold that virtue he ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. When he found that every thing exceeded the merchant's account and his own expectation, "it is enough," ſaid he, "I am again reconciled to my own ſpecies. Notwithſtanding the impreſſion I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ſtory of the unfortunate Abbas, virtue has yet her temples among men! but, ſurely, ſhe is a villager, and her votaries are the inhabitants of the field!"

               <head>CHAP. VIII.</head>
               <p>WHEN the dawn of the morning broke, Solyman and the merchant, with the moſt grateful acknowledgments of the hoſpitality with which they had been entertained, left the village of Arden, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the kind wiſhes of their hoſt, and his amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble family. They travelled for ſome days through the ſouthern provinces of Perſia, without any remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occurrences, or any other entertainment, than ſuch as could be found in the diverſity of proſpects, and the different labors of men. Sometimes they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed themſelves with the contemplation of thoſe places, which hiſtory had marked out as the ſcenes of great events; and ſometimes had occaſion to reflect on the periſhable monuments of human magnificence.</p>
               <p>The noble plain on which ſtood the once glorious Perſepolis afforded them inexhauſtible matter of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity and meditation: this plain extending about nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen leagues, abounds every where with villages, and is watered by the great river Araxes. Nature has been ſo induſtrious in the defence of it, that ſhe has raiſed before it mountains, that bear all the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and might anſwer the end of artificial fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. From hence the travellers were amuſed with the ruinous remains of many noble edifices, that had once adorned the range of mountains: but when they were come to that part of them which covered the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient palace of Perſepolis, the ſtupendous ruin ſtruck them with ſilent aſtoniſhment. Porticoes, which had withſtood the aſſaults of time more than two thouſand years; broken columns of different lengths, riſing at conſiderable diſtances within the limits of the ſame pile; ſculptured portals, through whoſe frowning ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the winds paſs with a hollow murmuring; num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs figures engraven on the pilaſters of thoſe port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and multitudes of hieroglyphics on the different parts of the ſpacious ruin; gave the travellers a
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030671_0025_0FE85B6F472963A8"/>
mournful and magnificent idea of the priſtine grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur of this edifice,</p>
               <p>The merchant obſerving Solyman to be totally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed in thought, would not interrupt the melancholy pleaſure of his contemplations; but waited, in ſilence, till, with an air of unaffected concern, he thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſentiments on Perſepolis.</p>
               <p>"I am at a loſs, my friend, in the midſt of theſe magnificent ruins, whether I ſhould think more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or more meanly of mankind. Pride raiſed this lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty edifice, and pride deſtroyed it.—The vanity of a Cyrus, a Darius, or a Xerxes, adorned thoſe ſuperb columns; and the vanity of an Alexander defaced them. Theſe domes were not reared ſolely for regal magnificence and ſecurity, but to aid the appetites of poverty and luxury, and to ſecrete the royal pleaſures from thoſe that toiled to gratify them. Thus, as this noble ſtructure was poſſibly raiſed not only for vanity but for riot; ſo, probably, by vanity inflamed by riot, it fell: probably at the requeſt of a ſmiling harlot, the towers of Perſepolis blazed for her diverſion; probably, becauſe the conqueror had taken too large a draught of wine, this palace, the glory of eaſtern art, ſunk to the ground: a ſtriking inſtance of the vanity of human labors, and the depravity of human nature! on the other hand, while I conſider the work of the artiſt; while I am delighted with the ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and proportion, which is yet to be traced through theſe maimed ruins, and ſtruck with the bold relief of the ancient Perſian achitecture; I forget the motives both of the erection and demolition of Perſepolis; and admire the induſtry and ingenuity of man, that gave ſuch grace and beauty to theſe maſſy ſtructures."</p>
               <p>"Your ſentiments," ſaid the merchant, "are much the ſame with my own, but give me leave now to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you to a mountain, about two leagues diſtant from theſe ruins, and ſituated between two of the moſt beautiful plains in the world. This mountain conſiſts of one entire rock, capable of the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030671_0026_0FE85B70D17D8A00"/>
poliſh: it is reduced to form by art, and its ſides are perpendicular; ſo that, at a diſtance, it has the appearance of a wall. Upon this rock are ſeveral pieces of baſs relief, exquiſitely performed; in one of which is repreſented a combat between the king of Perſia, and the king of the Indies; the latter of whom, according to the tradition of the times, was ſubdued. There are beſides many other figures, of which, though you may not diſcover the deſign, you will be pleaſed with the execution."</p>
               <p>Solyman proceeded with his friend to the mountain, much delighted, as well with the extraordinary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the rock, as the uncommon beauty of the plains that were ſpread on either hand beneath, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with villas ſhaded by trees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> extenſive meadows, and paſtures filled with flocks. When they had grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified their curioſity, and indulged their ſpeculations, they proceeded on their journey, and in a ſhort time arrived at the Gulf of Baſſora.</p>
               <p>The merchant, having here found the veſſel he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, told Solyman, that if his inclination led him to Europe, he could accommodate him with a convenient paſſage; informing him, at the ſame time, that his own affairs would detain him ſome years longer in Perſia. Solyman, whoſe heart was firmly attached to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, long heſitated between friendſhip and curioſity: however, as he muſt have parted with him had he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his travels in Aſia, and was not totally without hopes of ſeeing him in what he called the new world, he determined to accept his offer.</p>

               <p>AS the ſhip was to remain ſome time in the gulf, Solyman took the opportunity to make the tour of India. In his way he viſited the Iſle of Ormus, than which no part of nature wears a more
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030671_0027_0FE85C390C2C45A0"/>
diſmal appearance. Excepting a few houſes, which make the capital of the place, the whole looks like a heath blaſted by lightning, or burnt up by deſign. Yet here, in this ſcene of dreary deſolation, Solyman had the mortification to meet with an exile from the city of Iſpahan.</p>
               <p>"Surely," ſaid he to the unhappy man, "you muſt have been ſo unfortunate as to commit ſome enormous crime, condemned as you are to this miſerable abode?"</p>
               <p>"Stranger," replied the exile, "I have been unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, but not unjuſt. One day, being at the Perſian court, I told a gentleman who ſtood near me in a low whiſper, that I thought the Sultana Moratte extremely beautiful.—This was my crime! and it was the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of imperial juſtice, that for this I ſhould wear out the remains of life in this dreary ſolitude,"</p>
               <p>"Heavens!" ſaid Solyman, "what madneſs muſt poſſeſs mankind, to lodge unlimited power in the hands of any one human being! when the decrees of juſtice muſt be iſſued by numbers united, there are many means of reſtraining partial or illegal ſentences: ſelf-intereſt, revenge, envy, and every other cauſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting juſtice, would then operate feebly, when oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by public ſhame, divided intereſts, and the open appearance of equity. But what comfort can you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from uſeleſs declamation? I can help you to the means of deliverance from this wretched priſon; and I think that you are reſtrained by no principle of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from embracing them; for it is impoſſible, that Divine Power ſhould enforce obedience to the decrees of injuſtice. I am now about to travel through In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia; at my return I will again viſit Ormus and you; and if you ſhall be inclined to exchange your priſon for the ſpacious kingdoms of Europe, I will procure you a paſſage thither."</p>
               <p>The exile heard theſe words with inconceivable tranſport; he threw himſelf at the feet of Solyman, and expreſſed his delight in one emphatical word cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out—"Liberty, liberty!" the pleaſure of the trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030671_0028_0FE85C406BC50460"/>
was ſcarce inferior to that of the exile. "Surely," ſaid he to himſelf, "the diffuſion of happineſs is the higheſt bliſs that the human heart is capable of! I feel more delight in the hope of defeating the malice of injurious power, than in any thing I have ever met with, either before or ſince the beginning of my travels.</p>

               <p>SOLYMAN now left Ormus, and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards the frontiers of India. Though the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try lies nearly in the ſame climate with the ſouthern provinces of Perſia, yet the aſpect of it is different; and it is furniſhed with other kinds of plants and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imals, as well as with people of a different complexion, and different manners: indeed nature ſeems to have made the intercourſe of different nations neceſſary, by ſupplying each with ſome peculiar conveniences.</p>
               <p>Solyman paſſed not through the provinces of the Mogul's empire without inſtruction as well as amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was ſkilled in the natural hiſtory of plants and animals; and he ſound here abundant opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to exerciſe that kind of knowledge. He was often amuſed by obſerving, how nearly brutal ſenſe borders upon human reaſon, in the reflecting ſagacity of the elephant, and the adroit miſchief of the baboon.</p>
               <p>Small, however, in compariſon, was the pleaſure he received from the natural rarities of India, to that which the excellent adminiſtration of juſtice in the ſeveral provinces afforded him.—The police of that country appeared to him moſt wiſely calculated for the preſervation of peace and property; the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates that were appointed to adminiſter juſtice in their ſeveral diſtricts, being obliged to keep perſons contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually employed to watch the dealings of commerce, and attend both to public and private tranſactions; for the iniquity of which themſelves were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030671_0029_0FE85B77B65E4A08"/>
and the emperor might always be appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to.</p>
               <p>But when he came to Delhi, the capital of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal's empire, his opinion of the Indian policy was much altered. He there had the mortification to find a miniſtry of wives, and a court of concubines, at whoſe diſcretion the principle poſts in the civil and military eſtabliſhments were uſually diſpoſed of; and he who was moſt recommended by his perſon and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, was ſure to obtain the higheſt office in the leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſlature or the army. To find that the bands of muſic at court conſiſted only of women, gave him no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt: "There," ſaid the traveller, "the ladies are in their proper ſphere. Let them cultivate all the ſoft and engaging graces: let them employ themſelves in the embelliſhments of art and the excurſions of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but let them not interfere in the important con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of government; nor raiſe thoſe to the places of power, whoſe accompliſhments are ſuited only to their taſte."</p>
               <p>As Solyman was diſpleaſed with the caballing arts of the Indian ladies, ſo he was ſhocked at their inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and unnatural ſupeſtition. With horror and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement did he ſometimes behold a woman, in the bloom of life and beauty, ruſh into the flames to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the manes of her dead huſband: and if na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhuddered at the thought of this dreadful ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, or female ſoftneſs ſhrunk into fear or irreſolution, he beheld a number of diabolical prieſts, with execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcreams, and faces of honor, puſhing forward the poor trembling reluctant woman to the burning pile. "Eternal Mithra!" ſaid the afflicted youth, "what havoc does ſuperſtition make among thy works! when once that fiend enters the human heart, nature and reaſon are driven out; their ſacred lights are wholly extinguiſhed; truth and humanity are trampled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the deteſted fury leads her infatuated vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries through the horrors of darkneſs, into the arms of death!"</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <p>SOLYMAN was the more affected by this infernal cuſtom, as he feared it might one day be the fate of a lady, with whom he had contracted an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friendſhip, and for whom he had the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der regard. This amiable perſon was a native of Delhi, and her name Almena. As the houſes in which they lodged were contiguous, ſhe firſt drew his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by her muſic, which was her favorite employment, and in which ſhe was greatly ſkilled. Solyman had a taſte for all the fine arts; and, after the inquiries and obſervations of the day, he felt an irreſiſtable pleaſure, in liſtening, from his portico, to the evening muſic of Almena. His heart ſoon became prejudiced in favor of a lady, who had afforded him ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; and he wiſhed for nothing more than an opportunity of expreſſing his gratitude.</p>
               <p>It was uſual for Almena to take a morning walk in the ſuburbs of Delhi. Solyman obſerved this; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced himſelf to her converſation, by paying his acknowledgments. There is ſome ſecret attraction in congenial natures, which draws them together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the forms of a long acquaintance. Solyman was ſoon convinced, that he diſcovered, in Almena, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition perfectly ſuited to his own: her converſation was the picture of a mind enlarged by virtue, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by learning: ſhe had none of the trifling follies or the inſignificant levity of her ſex; yet her manner was animated and cheerful: ſhe had no ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions of giddy wit; but her language was the clear and natural image of poliſhed ſenſe, and unaffected knowledge. Solyman left no means unattempted to cultivate a friendſhip that promiſed ſo much felicity. He conſtantly attended Almena in her morning walk; and, at every interview, entertained ſome new ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in her favor. Her heart was not leſs benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than his own: "You have ſeen, my friend," ſaid ſhe, "almoſt every thing in Delhi, that is worth the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030671_0031_0FE85B80365DDCA8"/>
of a ſtranger; but I ſuppoſe you do not make it your buſineſs, as a traveller, merely to attend to what is uncommon or magnificent; not merely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the different operations of nature, and manners of men. Travel muſt afford you many opportunities to relieve the indigent, to comfort the afflicted, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ignorant, or reſcue the oppreſſed. Within the compaſs of my morning walk, there is a village, the inhabitants of which I call my people; they are all poor; to thoſe that are able to labor, I propoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for the greateſt induſtry; and thoſe who are incapatiated by age or ſickneſs I take under my own protection."</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to conceive how much Solyman would be delighted with this account of Almena. When he found, that, to all the elegant graces of female ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe added the virtues of benevolence, his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for her was heightened into the moſt refined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. On the other hand, her regard for Solyman increaſed, as ſhe became acquainted with his improved underſtanding, and generous temper: for virtue loves her own image, wherever it is found.</p>

               <p>SOLYMAN had now paſſed many days at Delhi, in this pleaſing intercourſe of friendſhip; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to aſſiſt his Almena in the diffuſion of happineſs, charmed with her virtues, and delighted with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. The time, however, approached, when he was to think of his expedition into Europe; but the friendſhip of Almena bound to his heart by ſtronger ties than that which he had before contracted with the merchant, overbalanced at once every thought of his voyage: he had, therefore, determined to remain at Delhi; when the poor exile at Ormus came into his mind. He ſtarted at the thought, as he would have
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030671_0032_0FE85B81C5256200"/>
done at the ghoſt of Ardavan. "Tis done!" ſaid he: "Adieu to Almena; adieu to the dear delights of her friendſhip, if they muſt be purchaſed at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of virtue!"</p>
               <p>There is no precept of human wiſdom conceived to be of greater uſe, and therefore none more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged, than that we ſhould learn to avoid the evils of life, from the irregularities and misfortunes of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; yet important as this precept may be, it is, like moſt others, univerſally neglected. We obſerve, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the events of life; and inquire into their cauſes with infatiable curioſity; but we ſeldom draw any concluſions for the direction of our own conduct: we hear or read only for amuſement; and the ſtory paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by, without leaving any traces of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>Solyman, who, from the firſt ſetting out on his trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, had received the ſtrongeſt convictions of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of love, without the leaſt caution or reſiſtance ſuffered that paſſion to make its inroads under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of friendſhip; and he now felt all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, which he had before been a witneſs to, near the village of Abdat. Not once, however, did he heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate between love and virtue: the torrent of his grief for the loſs of Almena, violent as it was, could not bear down his determined integrity.</p>
               <p>With a heart full of the moſt piercing ſorrow, he went to take leave of his beloved friend: he reſolved, nevertheleſs, to explain the cauſe of his departure with the moſt ſerene indifference, determined not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his Almena by the appearance of ſorrow; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and threw himſelf at her feet in ſpeechleſs an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
               <p>Almena beheld his grief with united ſorrow and ſurpriſe; and, with tears that flowed from pity and friendſhip, entreated him to diſcover he cauſe of his diſtreſs. "It is in vain Almena," ſaid he, "it is in vain any longer to hide my heart from you: nor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſhould I act the part of friendſhip, to diſſemble its feelings. I, who was yeſterday the happieſt of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030671_0033_0FE85B88C5D57C08"/>
mankind in the enjoyment of your converſation, am now the moſt miſerable. By the indiſpenſable laws of honor and humanity, I am called from Delhi: but alas! by the love of Almena, I am induced to ſtay. I know, my friend, there is no alternative: but that knowledge is my miſery I go, then, from you and from happineſs; perhaps never more to enjoy either; but when I am far from you, it will be ſome conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to believe that you will remember the love and the truth of Solyman."</p>
               <p>Almena, as well as the emotions of her heart would give her leave, replied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> "Go my friend; go where your virtue leads you, and providence be your guide! Your friendſhip while I have life, ſhall not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: no; Almena ſhall always reſpect your memory, and love you with the ſame affection as ſhe does the deareſt of her friends."</p>
               <p>A flood of tears followed theſe words; and Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, unable any longer to behold her ſorrow, precip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itately withdrew.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="13" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XIII.</head>
               <p>DEPRIVED of that ſerenity which ever waits on conſcious virtue, when free from the great calamities of life, the innocent the once happy Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was now become the child of affliction. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the provinces of India in deep melancholy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected by every thing that might excite curioſity or exerciſe ſpeculation. But, behold the power of virtue! and be convinced, whoever thou art that readeſt this ſtory, that there is nothing equally capable of allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the afflictions which are incident to human life.</p>
               <p>When he arrived at Ormus, and beheld the joy of the poor exile at the ſight of his deliverer, he felt a torrent of pleaſure in his breaſt, overflowing all the oppoſitions that grief had raiſed againſt it. "O that
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030671_0034_0FE85B8A50653848"/>
Almena," ſaid he, "were preſent! that I could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to her the happineſs I feel in reſcuing this poor Perſian from the oppreſſion of tyranny! how would her gentle heart rejoice, and indulge itſelf with Solyman in the delights of benevolence! Fate has been ſevere in dividing thoſe whoſe ſouls were made for each other: but it has left me this happineſs, and I enjoy it."</p>
               <p>Solyman was now about to apply to his friend the merchant, who was ſtill upon the coaſt, to procure a paſſage for the exile, but he could not reſiſt the deſire of writing immediately to Almena; and from Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus he ſent the following letter:</p>

When he perceived me from the rocks on which he uſed to wander daily to watch my coming, he flew towards me in an ecſtacy of joy, crying out—"Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! my deliverer! Liberty!" Here was a ſcene, my friend, that might have overbalanced every thing but the loſs of your company. For that, Almena—for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me—for that I muſt yet ſhed a tear.</p>

               <p>AFTER the diſmiſſion of this letter, he went immediately to viſit the merchant, who received him with the warmeſt expreſſions of friendſhip.—
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030671_0035_0FE84D322AE260D8"/>
"Welcome," ſaid he "my valuable friend! whoſe uncommon virtues have made you devote the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urable ſeaſon of life, to the acquiſition of knowledge, and the diſtribution of happineſs."</p>
               <p>"For the latter of theſe purpoſes," ſaid Solyman, "I now wait upon you. In the iſle of Ormus is an unhappy Perſian, whom the capricious cruelty of his prince has condemned to perpetual exile in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal priſon. Were he a criminal, juſtice ſhould have its courſe; I might then have beheld him with pity, but ſhould not have meditated his deliverance; but he is innocent, my friend, he is innocent, and ſuffers. Cannot you aſſiſt me to effect his eſcape? cannot he have that paſſage to Europe, which you obligingly offered me?"</p>
               <p>"To facilitate the eſcape of an exile," replied the merchant, "were as much as my intereſt and ſafety are worth in Perſia. I muſt not be concerned in it; but I will introduce you to the captain of a ſhip, and engage him to ſerve you in every thing you ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: after which if you can take the exile along with you in diſguiſe, or by any other means, as your friend or attendant, perhaps he may eſcape without much difficulty or danger. I have diſpatched my buſineſs on the coaſt, and am obliged to return to Iſpahan: let us now therefore, if you pleaſe, wait upon the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain."</p>
               <p>Solyman, as he had been in hopes of procuring the exile a paſſage without going himſelf into Europe, from which the friendſhip of Almena had weaned his inclinations, was ſomewhat embarraſſed by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. However, as he was determined at all events to deliver the poor Perſian, he went immediately to the apartments of the captain, to whom the merchant recommended him as a particular friend who wanted to make the tour of Europe.—The captain received them with the freedom and cheerfulneſs peculiar to his ſtation, and promiſed Solyman the beſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030671_0036_0FE85C41F7903670"/>
of his ſhip; but told him, that ſhe muſt remain there a few months before ſhe could get out of the gulf.</p>
               <p>Of this delay, though not anſwerable to his impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient wiſhes for the deliverance of the exile, Solyman reſolved to make uſe, in viſiting his father and the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Irwan. As ſoon therefore as he had acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the exile with what he had to hope, and adviſed him to provide ſecretly for his voyage, and his ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in a diſtant country, he ſailed from the gulf up the Euphrates as far as where the Tigris empties itſelf into that river, and from thence proceeded by land to the valley of Irwan.</p>

               <p>THE venerable Ardavan had aſcended an eminence near his houſe, to enjoy the beauties of the ſummer evening, and to offer up a prayer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting ſun for Solyman, when Solyman appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
               <p>What language can paint the emotions of paternal affection? The feeble remains of aged life twice faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beneath the wait of joy. At length recovering he cried—"It is enough! Solyman lives! Heaven has regarded the virtues of my ſon, and reſtored him to the arms of Ardavan."</p>
               <p>Solyman was not leſs affected by this meeting; nor leſs delighted to find his aged parent ſtill enjoying health and reaſon in the decline of life. But his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, was allayed with anxiety.—He viſited the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite ſcenes of his native valley in hopes of finding that delight which he thought to be connected with the idea of them; but his imagination was ſtill at Delhi. As love and melancholy are of the ſiſterhood of poetry, he had not been long in the valley before he wrote the following lines—</p>

                  <head>TO ALMENA, FROM THE BANKS OF THE IRWAN.</head>
                  <l>WHERE trembling poplars ſhade their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vale,</l>
                  <l>And tune to melody the mountain gale;</l>
                  <l>Where Irwan murmurs muſically ſlow,</l>

                  <l>Friend of my heart, behold thy poet laid</l>
                  <l>In the dear ſilence of his native ſhade!</l>
                  <l>Ye ſacred vales, where oft the Muſe, unſeen,</l>

                  <l>Is it that knowledge is allied to woe;</l>
                  <l>And are we happy, only ere we know?</l>
                  <l>Is it that Hope withholds her golden ray,</l>
                  <l>That fancy's fairy viſions fade away?</l>
                  <l>Or can I, diſtant far from all that's dear,</l>

                  <l>Thus mourn'd the muſe, when, thro' his ofiers wild,</l>

               <p>Where are the delights of the valley of Irwan, where the flowery variety of its paſtures and mead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ows, its hills that roſe gradually to meet the morning ſun, and its groves that ſpread their foilage to exclude the heats of midday? Wrapt in the gloom, of penſive ſolitude, the ſon of Ardavan was now negligent of theſe, and of all that once delighted or amuſed him. In vain did his father deſire a relation of his travels; and in vain did he begin it: when he attempted to ſpeak of Perſepolis, he gave a deſcription of Delhi; when he was aſked after ſome other place, he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the village of Almena: inſtead of deſcribing the people of India, he deſcribed the perſon of Almena; and when an account of their manners was requeſted— "Her manners," he replied, "are ſuch as the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Mithra looks down upon with delight."</p>

            <div n="16" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
               <p>ARDAVAN was now no longer at a loſs to account for the gloomy inconſiſtency of his ſon's behavior: but willing to be ſtill more convinced of what he ſuſpected to be the cauſe, he applied to his paſſions the ſtory of thoſe lovers whom he had rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommended to his care. At the mention of the lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Solyman was rouſed from his melancholy negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, into the moſt eager attention. "Tell me, my father," ſaid the impatient youth: "tell me, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, the fate of the lovers?"</p>
               <p>"I thank you," replied the ſage, "for putting it in my power to aſſiſt the unfortunate. From your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the ſufferings of theſe lovers, and your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to alleviate them, you will feel more ſenſibly
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030671_0039_0FE85B9A28B668B8"/>
the power of the ſame conſolation, when your own heart becomes a prey to the diſtreſſes of love."</p>
               <p>Solyman diſcovered, by his emotions, the effect which this ſhort preface had upon him.</p>
               <p>"You know," continued Ardavan, "a ſmall build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I erected ſome years ago for a retreat in the ſummer months; you remember its ſituation, in the depth of a ſpacious wood; which is only acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by one narrow paſſage, to which I have provided a door, ſo beſet with evergreens, that it is impoſſible for the moſt curious eye to perceive it: the canal of running water in the middle of the wood, and the beautiful graſs-plat I have extended, ſince you left me, to the ſummer-houſe. To this place I conducted the lovers as ſoon as I had heard their ſtory. There they continued for ſome time, attended by one of my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful domeſtics, who ſupplied them with every neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and they were viſited almoſt every day by myſelf. O, my ſon, how exquiſite was the delight, to behold the happineſs of this innocent pair, and at the ſame time to conſider myſelf as in ſome meaſure contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it! Surely this was to partake of the pleaſure of the Deity, which we believe to conſiſt in his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal power of removing evil and diſpenſing good!</p>
               <p>"After ſome time I was informed, that the khan of Bukharia, who had purchaſed the maiden of her father, was depoſed and baniſhed by the Sophi. This gave us new hopes; and it was agreed that the youth ſhould return to Abdat, to learn the diſpoſition of the unnatural parent. He accordingly went; and told him, that he would endeavor to find his daughter, upon condition that he would conſent to their marriage. The wretch, though he was no ſtranger to their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual paſſion, inſiſted that no man ſhould ever have his daughter who would not pay the ſame price for her which the khan of Bukharia had offered.</p>
               <p>"As this price far exceeded the ability of the lover, he returned to Irwan, fallen from thoſe pleaſing hopes, which he had ſo lately formed, of enjoying at once
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030671_0040_0FE85B9BB348A980"/>
his love and his liberty. The father, convinced that his daughter was in the poſſeſſion of the young man, and not now without hopes of recovering her, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering her again to ſale, hired a ſet of ruffians to watch his return, and to extort from him a confeſſion of the place where ſhe was ſecreted. Of this deſign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> however, he was timely appriſed by an honeſt villager of Abdat, to whom one of the ruffians had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated their buſineſs; and he came off in diſguiſe, and eſcaped their notice.</p>
               <p>"About two months after, it was reported that the father had died of vexation for the diſappointment of his avaricious views; I, therefore diſpatched a ſervant to inquire into the truth of this report; and finding it confirmed, conducted the lovers to Abdat without farther apprehenſion. The maiden, who was an only child, inherited her father's fortune, which was very conſiderable: but as great part of it had been amaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by oppreſſion, ſhe made reſtitution to thoſe whom his avarice had injured, and ſhe now enjoys the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder with happineſs and her lover."</p>
               <p>"What you tell me," ſaid Solyman, "gives me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible satiſfaction: for the lovers are poſſeſſed of eminent virtue; and to be inſtrumental to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of virtuous lovers, is the moſt delightful taſk within the province of benevolence. Indeed, thoſe hearts only that are generous and noble can be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the tender ſenſibility of love: for the breaſt which harbors malignity and envy, can never feel the ſympathetic tenderneſs which is the very eſſence of that gentle paſſion."</p>
               <p>"Your obſervation," replied the ſage, "may be very juſt; and it is therefore the more neceſſary for thoſe to whom nature and the principles of a virtuous education have given the bleſſing of an open heart, to guard againſt the inroads of that paſſion: if there is no probability of an uninterrupted enjoyment of its object, they ſhould look upon its advances, as of an evil that will deſtroy their peace, The pleaſures of

real-love are, perhaps the moſt refined, the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and ſenſible, of any we are capable of enjoying: but believe me, thoſe are fortunate lovers, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnified by theſe, for the many uneaſy hours, the reſtleſs anxieties, and the painful apprehenſions they undergo."</p>
               <p>In theſe general terms did Ardavan deliver his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to his ſon, who received them with a ſilent conviction of their truth and propriety; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after this converſation, retired to offer up the following prayer to the Sun for Almena.</p>
               <p>"Incomparable and Everlaſting! whoſe univerſal eye ſees nothing fairer, nothing more virtuous, than Almena; O let that eye look upon her with the vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a parent. She moſt reſembles theſe in the continual exerciſe of beneficence; cheriſh, therefore, thoſe virtues that are congenial with thy own; and let the dear poſſeſſor, through thy benignant influence, enjoy the conſtant bleſſings of health and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but if ſome portion of ſorrow be the birthright of every human being, immortal Mithra! may Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena only ſigh for the abſence of her friend!"</p>

               <p>IN ſuch exerciſes did Solyman employ his retired hours, till the time approached for his return to Ormus. As he was determined if poſſible, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void going into Europe, he made no mention of that circumſtance to his father: his engagements to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile were a ſufficient reaſon for his departure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, in a ſhort time, he arrived at the gulf, and waited upon the Engliſh captain, who was preparing for his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Solyman informed him, that upon ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting occaſion he was obliged to relinquiſh his deſign of viſiting Europe; but that he would recommend a Perſian lady to his care, who was bound for England;
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030671_0042_0FE85BA482EC0048"/>
and he begged that ſhe might enjoy all the retirement her ſituation could afford. As no objection was made to this propoſal, he privately purchaſed the habit of a Perſian lady, which he concealed ſome days on the coaſt of Ormus; and, under favor of the night, he found no difficulty to procure a boat to the Engliſh veſſel. In a few hours they got under ſail; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received repeated aſſurances of the captain's eare, and engaged the good offices of his crew by a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome gratuity, he procured a paſſage by ſea to the coaſt of India.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of his heart was now very different from what it had been a few days before: he had diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his engagements to the exile, with all the ſucceſs that he could wiſh; and his face was now ſet towards Delhi. On he travelled with the eager pace of a lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and in a few days reached the capital of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul's empire.</p>
               <p>The evening he arrived, he flew to the houſe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena, who received him with emotions of tenderneſs which ſhe was ſcarcely able to conceal. When the firſt ſalutations were paſſed, ſhe aſked him how he had diſpoſed of the exile, and why he did not accompany him to Europe as he had propoſed. He informed her by what means he had procured the exile's eſcape; adding, that from the letters he had written, if ſhe had received them, ſhe might at once ſee the reaſon both of his rejecting the European voyage, and his return to Delhi.</p>
               <p>"What would it availed me," ſaid he, "to have viſited the diſtant regions of the univerſe! What pleaſure or amuſement could I have expected to find in Europe, when all my heart holds dear was ſtill in Aſia? Believe me, this place is now more than the whole world to me; and the friendſhip of Almena is the only pleaſure I can enjoy."</p>
               <p>"I have received your letters," ſaid ſhe; "and if they ſpeak the language of your heart, I am no ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to its feelings. To deal ingenuouſly with you, I
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030671_0043_0FE85BAB8BB884D0"/>
am ſenſible of your merit, and admire your virtues: and were I not more happy in my preſent condition, than I could hope to be in any other, I know not the man, with whom I would rather divide the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life, than with Solyman."</p>
               <p>"Is it poſſible, then," ſaid Solyman, "that you can think the condition of celibacy happier than that of marriage? Undoubtedly, the principal happineſs of mankind depends on the intercourſe of ſociety, and the connections of friendſhip; marriage is nothing elſe but a ſtate of friendſhip, in which the friends by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting their intereſts, have a conſtant and uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enjoyment of each other. Nature aids this union, and reaſon approves it: can any condition bid fairer for happineſs, than that in which the mutual delights of friendſhip can only be torn from us by the hand of death?</p>
               <p>"There may be ſome truth," anſwered ſhe, "in what you obſerve; but there is an inconſtancy in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, that makes it dangerous even for two friends to enter into any connection that cannot be broken; and an unaccountable caprice, that makes us quarrel with our happineſs, becauſe we are ſure of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it."</p>
               <p>"Were we deterred from every purſuit," ſaid So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman, "by the apprehenſion of thoſe inconveniences which the foibles and frailties of our nature might bring upon us, we ſhould never be either virtuous or happy; but might languiſh away our lives in ſolitary and unſocial indolence. To avoid the inconveniences of human inconſtancy, marriage is, ſurely, the beſt inſtitution in the world; for what could be more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fix the inconſtant, than the habitual intercourſe of kindneſs and good offices: than that gratitude, which is due to the long exerciſe of affectionate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; and thoſe dear pledges, which muſt depend for happineſs and ſupport on the unanimity of their parents?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:030671_0044_0FE85BAD16B76A18"/>"There is, indeed, an inſuperable objection to your being married in India: I mean, that contempt, or the horrid alternative of torture, which is entailed on the unhappy woman who ſurvives her huſband. But that objection ſhall vaniſh immediately," continued the lover, with a look of paſſionate earneſtneſs: "let us go, my friend, let us go to love and happineſs in the valley of Irwan. That place, which ſo lately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a retreat to the lovers whoſe diſtreſſes I have related to you, ſhall then become eternally ſacred to love and friendſhip: that place, whoſe beautiful ſcenes I ſo lately beheld with indifference, I ſhall then viſit with rapture.—Extacy is in the thought! to enjoy, with Almena the ſhades of Irwan; with her to walk in my native fields; with her to pluck down on the banks of my favorite ſtream; for her to pluck the flower, whoſe beauty may have drawn her attention: to lead her through theſe romantic ſcenes, that delighted the innocent enthuſiaſm of my childhood: and to ſhow her the more ſolitary retreats, which I ſought when her friendſhip had firſt taught me to ſigh!"</p>
               <p>Thus Solyman poured out the natural and paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſenſations of love; and Almena, whoſe heart was far from being indifferent to him, eaſily caught the enthuſiaſm. "To your honor and your friendſhip," ſaid ſhe, "I can truſt every thing. I am ready to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend you to thoſe ſcenes, of which you have given me ſo lively a deſcription; whether they may anſwer it or not, or whatever they may be, the friendſhip of Solyman, will make them agreeable."</p>
               <p>It is eaſier to conceive than to expreſs the joy which, the lover felt upon this declaration. Within a few, days they ſet forward from Delhi, on their journey to the valley of Irwan; and for the greater expedition, and the leſs fatigue, they determined to go by ſea, and accordingly proceeded to the coaſt, where they went on board a trading veſſel bound for the Perſian gulf.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII</head>
               <p>AT that time there was a war between two petty princes of the higher peninſula of India; and unfortunately, the ſhip in which they embarked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to one of theſe powers.—They had not proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above five leagues from the coaſt, when they were purſued by the foe. After an obſtinate and bloody engagement, they were boarded; and their enemies, when they had ſtripped the veſſel of every thing valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, diſmiſſed it.</p>
               <p>They diſmiſſed the veſſel; but they took Almena. What heart does not bleed, what eye does not ſhed a tear, for the miſerable Solyman; They diſmiſſed the veſſel; but they took Almena! Prayers and tears, and agony and anguiſh were vain. The lover ſaw his dear, trembling, fainting maid, dragged by the hands of the unfeeling ſailors into their own ſhip, after they had bound him, to prevent the effects of his rage, "I aſk not for your mercy," cried the wretched youth: "only take me into your veſſel along with that lady, and prepare your tortures, your racks, and wheels: for me prepare them, and let me periſh, before theſe eyes loſe ſight of Almena!"</p>
               <p>While Solyman was vainly uttering theſe pitiable exclamations, the enemy ſteered away, and was in a ſhort time out of ſight. The men of the ſhip in which he was, apprehenſive of ſome bad conſequences from the violence of his rage, were prudent enough to let him continue bound; while he now loaded them with the reproachful terms of ſlaves and cowards, and now excited them by promiſes, or entreated them by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to purſue the foe.—The ſhip having loſt her freight, did not proceed on her intended voyage, but returned to the coaſt of India</p>
               <p>When they arrived, Solyman was informed that the veſſel which had taken them belonged to the king of Sundah, who at that time was at war with the king of Kanara. Upon this information, as ſoon as he had
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030671_0046_0FE85BB5D8E8FFB8"/>
received intelligence of the ſituation of the kingdom of Sundah, he went immediately in queſt of Almena. Though almoſt worn to death with fatigue and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, he travelled night and day, till he reached the country. But, alas! when he was there, what could he do? Stranger as he was to the people, and in a great meaſure to their language, he had as much to hope from chance, as from application, for the diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of Almena.</p>
               <p>He would now have ſunk under the weight of his misfortunes, had he not availed himſelf of the firſt advice of Ardavan, and firmly relied on the Eternal Providence. "Immortal Mithra!" ſaid the afflicted youth, "thou beholdeſt me oppreſſed with miſery: but thy beams ſtill ſhine upon me; and while I enjoy thy light, I will hope for thy favor!"</p>
               <p>Thus comforting himſelf, he ſtill continued his ſearch: depending, for the neceſſary ſupports of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, on the precarious bounty of the villages through which he paſſed; frequently making the mountain rocks the refuge of his night's repoſe, when nature, exhauſted with toil and ſorrow, in her own defence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined him to ſleep. He wandered inceſſantly from town to town, and from province to province; often expoſed to the attacks of ſavage beaſts, and often ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the inſults of the more ſavage people.</p>
               <p>Having in vain gone over a large tract of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land country, he now confined his ſearch to the coaſt, in hopes that he might again ſee the veſſel which took his Almena. Day by day he wandered on the beach, conſtantly caſting his eyes on the immenſe waſte of waters, and watching the approach of every veſſel he ſaw, with the ſame impatience of expectation, as if he had been aſſured that it contained Almena.</p>

               <p>AS he was walking one evening by the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Sevaſir, he heard a mournful voice proceeding from a garden within the fort. Solyman never neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the voice of ſorrow: he went nearer to the place from whence it ſeemed to proceed; and looking through the iron paliſadoes, with which the garden was encompaſſed, he beheld a lady ſitting in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly poſture on a flower-bank at a ſmall diſtance.</p>
               <p>In the irreſiſtable tranſport of his heart, he cried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud—"Almena!" The lady roſe; and as ſhe came towards him, he perceived his miſtake.—"Pardon me, Madam," ſaid he; "I am an unhappy man who have loſt every thing that is dear to me, in a lady whom I have ſought in vain for many months in this province; where I have ſtill reaſon to believe ſhe is confined, if indeed ſhe yet lives; if ſhe is not fallen a ſarifice to her own miſeries, or to the barbarous cruelty of the villains who tore her from me.</p>
               <p>"Stranger," ſaid the lady, "it is long ſince I have known any comfort myſelf, and I am afraid I can have little for you. Your miſeries affect me much: the ſame did my beloved huſband once undergo, for whom I now mourn, and muſt forever mourn in hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſorrow."</p>
               <p>"Is your huſband then dead?" ſaid Solyman; "or is he only loſt to you as Almena is to me? if the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the caſe, you may yet have hope; the all-ſeeing eye of Providence looks down upon all his creatures, and he will aſſuredly redreſs the misfortunes of the virtuous.</p>
               <p>"We were inhabitants," replied the lady, "of the kingdom of Kanara. The Sundians, who made an incurſion into our territories, amongſt many other wretched people, carried off my huſband and me—" "How, madam!" interrupted Solyman: "they were merciful, if they ſuffered your huſband to accompany you."—"Their mercy," ſaid ſhe, "did not extend ſo
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:030671_0048_0FE85C4ADE3473D0"/>
far: they preſented me to the governor of this caſtle; and my huſband they impriſoned in a diſtant part of the kingdom.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince I came within theſe hated walls, their ſavage maſter has aggravated my miſeries, by the mortifying offers of his love; totally regardleſs of my ſorrow and diſtraction, a thouſand times has the unfeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wretch inſulted my torn heart with odious careſſes, and ſtill continues to perſecute me in the ſame manner, upbraiding me with ingratitude for what he calls his kindneſs in permitting me to live. But I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in my misfortunes; here are numbers of unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py women under the ſame confinement, whoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings too nearly reſemble my own. Some of them, like me, have ſtill reſiſted the importunities of the tyrant; while others, more, I hope through fear than inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have unhappily ſubmitted to his will."</p>
               <p>At theſe words, terror and apprehenſion were again rouſed in the heart of Solyman, and created a conflict which ſhook his frame. He ſtood aghaſt and motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for a moment: at laſt recollecting himſelf—"Is there" ſaid he, "tell me, Madam, is there a lady with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe walls, a native of Delhi, who was taken ſome months ago from on board a Kanarian veſſel by the Sundians?</p>
               <p>"To that queſtion," ſaid the lady, "I can make no anſwer: we are all kept in different apartments, and not allowed to converſe with each other; we are not even permitted, but alone, to walk in theſe gardens: and ſhould I now be obſerved to talk with you, though through theſe deteſted bars my future liberty would probably be endangered. All that you can do to know, whether the lady you have loſt be in this place, is to attend at the different hours of the day near theſe pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſadoes; where you will be able to obſerve, in their reſpective turns, the appearance of the women in the gardens. But you will incur great danger in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment: and, after all, ſhould you find that your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is here, what can it avail you? You will only have the mortification to know it, without being able to reſcue her.</p>

               <p>SOLYMAN took his leave of the lady; and having formed his reſolution, waited with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impatience for the light of morning. He hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, indeed, to be ſo far ſecured from ſuſpicion, as to be dreſſed in a Sundian habit, which belonged to an officer of the ſhip that carried off Almena, who compelled him to take it in exchange for his own. But inſenſible of danger, at the earlieſt dawn he haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his poſt, and paſſed the day in alternate hope and deſpair: he ſaw many women, but he ſaw not Almena. In the evening therefore, regretting the diſappointment even of thoſe expectations which he dreaded to have confirmed, he reſolved to quit his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till the return of morning, when, by the glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of the moon, he perceived another lady enter the garden.</p>
               <p>As ſhe came nearer, her image glanced through his heart more ſwiftly than the lightning ſmites the traveller on the mountains of Hima. The lady was Almena. In a burſt of tranſport, he cried— "Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena! Solyman!" Struck at once with the voice, the name, and the figure of Solyman, ſurpriſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her, and ſhe fell ſenſeleſs upon the terrace.</p>
               <p>Solyman, unable to enter the garden, in an agony of terror cried out—"Save, ſave my Almena; at the ſame time running round the walls in the utmoſt diſtraction. His exclamations alarmed the guard, who immediately ſecured him; though, from his cries and confuſion, they concluded him to be mad, and made their report of him as ſuch to the governor of the caſtle, who ordered him to be immediately brought before him.</p>
               <p>Solyman, the moment he beheld the governor, fiercely cried out—"I conjure thee, if thou art a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being, let me inſtantly fly to the relief of a lady in the garden." The governor was alarmed by an appearance of reaſon in this requeſt, and ordered him
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030671_0050_0FE85BC662F854E0"/>
ſecured, while he went himſelf into the gardens to know if there was any foundation for it. There he found Almena ſupporting herſelf againſt the wall, not having perfectly recovered either her ſtrength or reaſon. "Art thou, indeed, my Solyman? ſaid ſhe: "if thou art my Solyman, ſupport me in thy arms." in his arms he took her, and bore her to a pavilion: where he held her till her reaſon returned. She turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her eyes full upon him; and, with a look of fear and ſorrow, ſhrunk from his embrace.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, Madam; I beſeech you tell me," ſaid the governor; "what is the cauſe of this diſtraction? Why are thoſe dear eyes ſo full of wildneſs and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror? and why do you look upon your protector with ſuch averſion? Is there then ſome other perſon more happy in your favor and affection? and muſt I forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er languiſh at your feet in vain?"</p>
               <p>"If thou haſt any other affection for me," ſaid Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena, "than that which is inſpired by brutal inſtinct; if thou haſt more feeling than the walls that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round thee, thou wilt ſurely pity me. The dear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy man, whom I fear ere now thy guards have ſeized, is the friend for whoſe loſs thou haſt known me mourn ever ſince I came within thy power. Yes, thou wilt pity me for thou has wept: when I related to thee my miſeries the tears of compaſſion flowed from thine eyes. Let us throw ourſelves at thy feet; let us owe our happineſs to thee, and thou ſhalt have all the affection which is not due to Solyman.</p>
               <p>The weeping beauty, as ſhe uttered theſe words, threw herſelf before him in ſuch an agony of ſorrow, and ſuch a poſture of ſupplication, as would have moved any heart in which vice had not extinguiſhed every ſpark of humanity. Far from being affected by it, the governor of Savaſir made her the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anſwer— "Abſurd and vain! to ſuppoſe that I ſhould tamely yield that happineſs to another, which I could never obtain myſelf. Know, Madam, that both you and your lover are now in my power; and
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030671_0051_0FE85BC7EDD07C30"/>
that he has no indulgence to hope for but what your kindneſs to me may procure him." With theſe words he withdrew; rather leſs offended at the thought of having a rival in Almena's affections than pleaſed with the hope that he might terrify her into compliance by his menaces againſt her lover.</p>
               <p>Almena remained in the moſt pitiful diſtreſs, ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by painful apprehenſions for her own honor, and the life of Solyman; and wandering alone into the garden ſhe added one night of ſorrow more to the many ſhe had ſuffered.</p>
               <p>Great God! what miſery may one villain, armed with power, bring upon thy creatures! Were there not a ſtate of exiſtence, where vice ſhall be puniſhed and virtue rewarded, how would thy works ſeem to reproach their Almighty Maker! But let the ſons of men learn, that he who is infinitely wiſe, is alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly juſt; and that he can as eaſily take cognizance of the moral conduct of his creatures, as he could at firſt create this immenſe ſyſtem of the univerſe, in which the minuteſt creature declares the ſkill of the Architect.</p>

               <p>When the morning appeared, Nagrakut, for that was the wretch's name, went at the uſual hour into the garden, Almena who was ſtill there, overcome by the weight of continual ſorrow, had ſunk into a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient ſlumber on a bench in the pavilion. Nagrakut, approached and ſtood by her as ſhe ſlumbered. There was a ſight that might have excited tenderneſs in the breaſt of a ſavage: but it moved not the heart

of Nagrakut, nor awakened any other paſſion in him but that of a libidinous deſire.

               <p>Nagrakut yet felt no pity; but placing himſelf near her on the bench, incloſed her in his arms. She awoke; and finding herſelf in the embraces of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, ſhrieked out with the moſt diſtreſsful horror. Her cries pierced the cell where Solyman was confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. With the united ſtrength of rage and terror, he burſt the door of his priſon; and running through the apartments of the caſtle with a dagger in his hand, which he had fortunately ſnatched up in the way, he flew to the Garden.</p>
               <p>Almena was ſtill ſhrieking and ſtruggling in the arms of Nagrakut, who endeavoring to ſooth her to his embraces, had not obſerved the approach of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman. "Villain," ſaid Solyman, "remove thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable hands from the perſon of that lady, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them in the defence of thy own!" Nagrakut, who was the moſt abject coward, called aloud to his guards. "Coward! ſlave!" ſaid Solyman; "draw this inſtant, or my dagger ſhall pierce thy heart." Nagrakut then fell at his feet; and begging for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, promiſed him Almena and liberty. "This mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then," ſaid Solyman, "diſmiſs us from thy curſed priſon." No ſooner had he uttered theſe words than the guards appeared. Nagrakut imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately beckoned to them to ſeize him: but Solyman, obſerving his motion, haſtily ran up to him, and plunging his dagger into his heart.</p>
               <p>The tyrant fell. No way of eſcape, however, was leſt for Solyman: he was inſtantly ſeized by the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, loaded with heavy chains, and ſhut up, with Almena, in a ſtrong apartment of the caſtle: with Almena he was ſhut up, for jealouſy now no longer
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:030671_0053_0FE85BD057A78EA8"/>
parted them; and ſhe was conſidered as an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice in the murder of the governor.</p>
               <p>This circumſtance adminiſtered inexpreſſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to them both. "At laſt, my Almena," ſaid the lover, "fortune has brought thee to my arms; but after what miſeries, good Heaven! and in what circumſtances! Yet my Heart never once doubted the juſtice or the care of Providence; we ſhall yet be happy in the valley of Irwan."</p>
               <p>The ſpirits of Almena were ſo exhauſted by the ſucceſſive ravages of terror, ſorrow and ſurpriſe, that ſhe reclined for ſome time in the arms of Solyman, unable to ſpeak, and only venting her grief in broken and feeble ſighs. The officers of the caſtle of Seva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir had ſent in the mean time to the king of Sundah, to know in what manner he would have the muderers of the governor executed.</p>
               <p>The death of a villain is ſeldom regretted, even by thoſe to whom his villainies have been of ſervice. The king of Sundah always hated the governor of Sevaſir; but he dared not depoſe him, becauſe he had been eſtabliſhed under him by the mogul: he, therefore, ſent no other commands to the officers of the caſtle, but that the priſoners ſhould remain there till farther orders.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, a body of Kanarians entered the country of Sundah, and laid ſeige to the caſtle of Sevaſir. As the death of the governor had thrown all into confuſion, the fort was eaſily carried; and the Kanarians took priſoners all that were within the caſtle. Solyman and Almena, though they could not be diſpleaſed at this change of fortune had yet another to encounter, which might prove as fatal to their happineſs as any they had eſcaped could have been.</p>
               <p>It is a cuſtom in the eaſtern nations, to preſent the women taken in war to the kings, that they may ſelect whom they like: and the reſt are divided among the officers, according to their ſeveral ranks. All the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030671_0054_0FE85BD746A727D0"/>
that were taken in the caſtle of Sevaſir, had this fate to undergo; and as the governor had been curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his choice, theſe women were looked upon as a moſt valuable capture.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="22" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXII.</head>
               <p>THEY were immediately conveyed to the court of Kanara, and preſented to the king for his choice. They all ſtood before him at the ſame time; and he looked upon each of them for ſome minutes: but his eye dwelt longer on Almena than the reſt. Unfortunately, ſhe obſerved this; and her fear and confuſion new animated her features, and gave freſh beauties to her complexion. The king immediately ſelected her, and the reſt were diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>Solyman was all this time kept with the garriſon of Sevaſir as a priſoner of war: but at length hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced the Kanarians, that he had no connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the king of Sundah, and that he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enter into the ſervice of their prince, his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was reſtored him. This was the only means by which he could attempt the recovery of Almena; who, as he was now informed, was retained by the king. He immediately repaired to the capital of Kanaria; and ſignifying to the officers of the court that he had ſome important intelligence relating to the war, to communicate to his majeſty, he gained an eaſy admittance to him.</p>
               <p>When the king appeared he proſtrated himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; and being commanded to ſpeak, he thus expreſſed himſelf: "Let the king of Kanaria live! for his ear is open to the complaints of the unhappy, and he deſpiſeth no man for the miſeries which chance hath brought upon him."—"I am a man," interpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the king; "proceed."—"It was my hand that put an end to the life of your enemy, the governor of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſir.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030671_0055_0FE85C5205260228"/>
"In that, replied the prince, "you did me a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſervice: but let me know your motives; and I ſhall be better able to judge of the action, as well as of my obligations to you for it."</p>
               <p>"O Prince!" ſaid Solyman, "I was poſſeſſed of a lady, more beautiful than the ſtar that overflows its urn in the evening, and dearer to me than the life drops of my heart. We were on board a Kanarian veſſel that was trading to the Perſian Gulph; and were bound to the valley of Irwan in Meſopotamia, the place of my nativity: but alas! before we had proceeded many leagues from our coaſt, we were boarded by a pirate of Sundah. We were plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſmiſſed; but the dear partner of my heart was taken from me. After long ſearch, I found that ſhe was in the poſſeſſion of the governor of Sevaſir; who regardleſs of her miſeries, or the prepoſſeſſion of her heart, cruelly continued to inſult her with the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of his love."—"Inhuman wretch!" interrupted the king: "but proceed."—This ejaculation gave Solyman new hopes, and he continued his relation.</p>
               <p>"Walking one evening by the gardens of the fort, I diſcovered her on a terrace at a ſmall diſtance. She was ſo much ſurpriſed by the ſuddenneſs of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that ſhe fainted. Being unable to enter the gardens, in my diſtreſs I cried for help; and my cries alarming the guard, I was ſeized. That night I was confined in a dungeon of the caſtle; but early the next morning hearing the ſhrieks of a female voice, which I either knew or fear imagined to be that of my love, rage and terror gave me more than natural ſtrength, and I burſt open the door of my priſon. I was unarmed; but, fortunately, a dagger lying in my way, I ſnatched it up, and flew to the garden from whence the voice proceeded. There I beheld the dear object of my affections trembling in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of the tyrant: at the ſight of me, he called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud to his guards, cowardly refuſing the offer I gave him of defending himſelf againſt my dagger; nay,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:030671_0056_0FE85BD8D2325EF8"/>
he meanly begged his life, and offered me, on that condition liberty for myſelf and the lady; but the guards immediately coming up, he beckoned to them to ſeize me: I found time, however, to thruſt my dagger into his baſe heart, thus the villain periſhed." —"And juſtice ſaid the king directed your arm."</p>
               <p>"O prince!" continued Solyman, I am ſtill miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. I have reaſon to believe, that ſome of your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers will detain the lady, as a prize taken in the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Sevaſir."—"No officer of mine," replied the king, "ſhall be ſuffered to detain her: let me know her name, and ſhe ſhall be immediately reſtored to you."—"Her name," ſaid Solyman, "is Almena."</p>
               <p>The king appeared diſturbed, and walked backward and forward for ſome moments, in the utmoſt confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He knew, that Almena was the lady whom he had ſelected from the captives; and he had the moſt ardent affection for her. In a few moments he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew, and commanded Solyman to attend him the following day.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="23" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XXIII.</head>
               <p>THE heart of the king was, in the mean time diſtracted by different paſſions; urged by the moſt powerful love to detain Almena, and diſſuaded from that by truth, humanity, and ſhame. "Am I," ſaid he, "poſſeſſed of a throne, and ſhall I have no more power to indulge my wiſhes, than the peaſant of the field! what is the worth or the end of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, if kings muſt tamely ſacrafice their incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, to the creatures they were born to command! Shall I give up ſuch beauty as that of Almena! a beauty that has ſmitten my heart, and inſpired me with ſuch tenderneſs of affection as I never yet felt for woman! But Almena was Solyman's!—It might be ſo; but ſhe is now mine. Poſſeſſion goes from
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030671_0057_0FE85C538FA7CC18"/>
one to another, according to the laws of nation; and, by thoſe laws, Almena is mine."</p>
               <p>"Why then do I feel theſe uneaſy ſenſations, as much at the thoughts of keeping, as of parting with her! the laws of nature and truth create them. The laws of nations ought always to be founded on theſe; and theſe ſuggeſt to me, that to keep Almena, would be moſt injurious and inhuman. Shall I, who have condemned that in another, as a crime which deſerved the puniſhment of death, commit the very ſame my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf! what a deteſtable hypocrite ſhould I appear! Shall I, who promiſed the lover that none of my offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhould deprive him of Almena; ſhall I degrade the king by doing what I would have puniſhed in a ſubject? I love Almena, and ſhould be exquiſitely happy in the enjoyment of her; but ſhall I, therefore, make her miſerable! How ſhould I ever partake of happineſs, if the object of my affections lived with me in ſullen diſcontent, or inconſolable ſorrow? Baſe and unworthy of the heart of man, muſt be that love, which would purchaſe its gratification by the miſery of its object! The heart of Almena is Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's, and ſo ſhall be her perſon: painful is the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native; but truth, and honor, and virtue muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail!"</p>
               <p>Thus the generous king of Kanara overcame the efforts of importunate deſire, by the force of virtue and reaſon; and nobly ſcorned to avail himſelf of his power againſt an unhappy man, who had been long perſecuted by misfortune, and diſtreſſed in his love.</p>
               <p>The hour came at which he had ordered Solyman to attend him. The king received him with a conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ſmile; and without the leaſt appearance of uneaſineſs or diſſatisfaction in his countenance, deſired him not to be apprehenſive about Almena, for that he ſhould ſhortly be put in poſſeſſion of her.</p>
               <p>Having thus ſpoken, he went immediately to her apartment, and gently taking her hand, "Moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful of the daughters of India," ſaid he, "ceaſe
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030671_0058_0FE85BDFF626C330"/>
your ſorrows! I am not come to offer you my love; but to recommend to you another lover, who poſſibly may be happier in your favor than I could ever hope to be: he is now in the palace; and if you will give me leave, I will in<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oduce him to you."—"My heart." ſaid Almena, "has been ſo much accuſtomed to new diſtreſſes, that it is not now ſhocked by their frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: but if you have any pity for me, ſuffer me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail my miſeries in ſolitude. Not to be interrupted in my ſorrows, is all I aſk; and that is not, ſurely, too much for you to grant." The king anſwered with a ſmile, "If I am not to be happy in your love, I am determined that none but the perſon whom I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to introduce to you, ſhall be ſo;" and haſtily quitting the appartment, returned with Solyman. The lovers flew to each others arms; "My Solyman!" —"My Almena!" In a few moments being recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, they threw themſelves at the feet of the king; and Solyman, as well as the tranſports of his heart would give him leave, expreſſed his gratitude: "Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous prince," ſaid he, "the thanks of Solyman are not worth your acceptance. But you will not be without a reward: yours ſhall be the ſupreme pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of conſcious goodneſs; yours ſhall be the care of Eternal Providence, and the prayers and bleſſings of Solyman and Almena!"</p>
               <p>In the gratitude of his heart, Solyman offered the king his aſſiſtance in the proſecution of the war with the Sundians; but he humanely refuſed his offer; telling him that love and war were no allies; that his ſufferings had already been too many and too great; and that neither he ſhould be expoſed to danger, nor Almena to fear, on his account. He moreover told them, that if they were inclined to return by ſea to the valley of Irwan, they ſhould be attended by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med veſſel, to ſecure them from the aſſaults of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy. But this obliging offer they declined; Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was unwilling any more to riſque that which was dearer than life; and Almena yet trembled at
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:030671_0059_0FE85BE187B47920"/>
the thoughts of the Sundian pirate. They, therefore, notwithſtanding the length and tediouſneſs of the way, determined to go by land; and having taken leave of the king, who ſupplied them with every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and lent them his own beaſts and attendants, they ſet their faces towards Delhi.</p>

               <p>THEIR road was through a mountainous country, troubleſome to the traveller; little cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the labors, or enlivened by the habitations of men. But what are the difficulties which love and hope cannot ſurmount! they deſpiſe the threats of danger, and the toils of labor; and proceed with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution through thoſe perplexities, which by other eyes are beheld with deſpair. The travellers thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imated, and looking forward to thoſe delightful ſcenes of reſt, thoſe days of rural eaſe and happineſs which they ſhould enjoy in the valley of Irwan, paſſed over the rugged mountains that oppoſed their way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſenſe of wearineſs or fear.</p>
               <p>After travelling many days, without any accident or delay, more than the neceſſary refreſhment of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture required, they arrived at Delhi. At the ſight of her native place, Almena ſhed a tear of joy, and the lovers embraced each other with more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon tenderneſs: ſo much is there in the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal circumſtances, to improve and exalt the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of the mind. Almena always loved her Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with the moſt tender affection; but ſhe loved him at Delhi, more than in any other place: delight is inſeparable from the idea of thoſe ſcenes, where we have paſſed the happy hours of childhood; and though, when in a maturity of life we reviſit our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive countries, we cannot enjoy that innocent thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs chearfulneſs, of which we ſtill retain ſome notion;
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:030671_0060_0FE85BE87A46E648"/>
yet we are delighted with the remembrance of it, and thoſe ſcenes are always dear to us.</p>
               <p>Almena forgot not to viſit her village, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom ſhe called her own. The poor inhabitants, at the ſight of their benefactreſs, wept with pleaſure; and ſhe did not leave them without giving them new exhortations to their duty, and new inſtances of her beneficence. Indeed, in all generous acts ſhe now doubled her aſſiduities: for ſhe concluded, that, on account of her great and ſingular obligations to Providence, ſhe ought in gratitude to have a ſuperior portion of virtue.</p>
               <p>After a ſhort ſtay at Delhi, Solyman and Almena renewed their journey, and ſet forward to Iſpahan. This route was longer; but it was more eaſy, and leſs expoſed to robbers, than that which led to the Perſian Gulf. When they arrived at Iſpahan, Solyman had the pleaſure to find his friend the merchant, who was ſtill detained by buſineſs in that city. He eaſily made his apology for not accepting, as he had propoſed, his kind offer of a paſſage into Europe, by introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to Almena. He related to him their vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous intereſting adventures, to which he liſtened with the eager curioſity and concern of a friend, acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edging all along the hand of Providence in their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervation. For the amiable and accompliſhed Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, he felt great eſteem: her pathetic deſcriptions, and her juſt and natural obſervations, were extremely entertaining and affecting. But he was moſt charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the character of the king of Kanara; and requeſted Almena to relate every particular of his behavior.</p>
               <p>"When I firſt beheld him" ſaid ſhe "I perceived in his countenance a noble affability and openneſs, which ſeemed to ſpeak a great and generous mind. This gave me ſome pleaſure; as I might have hopes from his compaſſion, ſhould it be my fate to be ſelected by him: ſuch you know it was.—When I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into an apartment of the palace, he waited on
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030671_0061_0FE85BEA08D1F710"/>
me with the moſt affable politeneſs; and ſeeing me in tears, he gently took my hand, and ſpoke to the following effect. "Be not diſtreſſed, fair Almena! Though you are in the power of a prince, you are not in the hands of a tyrant. If time and the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duities of tenderneſs may prevail on you to return my love, I ſhall be happy; if not, you ſhall never be made miſerable by cruelty or by violence." "Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with this declaration, was his whole conduct to me, during the time I was in his poſſeſſion. How I regained my liberty, you have already heard."</p>
               <p>"To the character which you have already receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Kanarian prince," ſaid Solyman to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, "I will add a poetical portrait, which poſſibly may not be diſagreeable to you: my gratitude for his favors, and my admiration of his virtues, induced me to attempt it."</p>

               <p>"The ode you have obliged me with," ſaid Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, "though I do not very well underſtand it, gives me ſome idea of the enthuſiaſm and harmony of the Engliſh poetry. But I am leſs pleaſed with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of art in your country, than the affectionate duty which the people ſhow to their king; for that is the baſis of civil happineſs; and indeed every human prince, who has the intereſt of his ſubjects at heart, will always reign in their affections.</p>
               <p>But now, my friend, if you are not too much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with your concerns at Iſpahan, will you be prevailed on to viſit the valley of Irwan? As you are a lover of nature, and of the muſes, you will there meet with much to entertain you; at leaſt, you
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030671_0065_0FE85BFA14D98A28"/>
will find a retreat from the fatigues of buſineſs, and the plagues of popularity. Almena too joins in this requeſt, and will be glad of ſo entertaining a friend in the firſt ſtages of her retirement."</p>
               <p>The merchant accepted the invitation, and they left Iſpahan the following day. He was deſirous to hear from Almena the ſtory of her captivity, and took the firſt opportunity to requeſt it: "I have heard," ſaid he, "from Solyman, the greateſt part of your adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but I have not been informed how you paſſed that unhappy period of time, from your being taken by the Sundians, to your departure from the caſtle at Sevaſir."</p>
               <p>"You call back memory, Sir," ſaid Almena, "to the days of miſery: but as I can, at this diſtance, look upon them without terror, I will endeavor to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe them to you.</p>
               <p>"When I was firſt taken by the Sundians, my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction was ſo great, that I retain no Idea of what paſſed, till the captain of the veſſel conveyed me on ſhore to the caſtle of Sevaſir and preſented me, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and almoſt frantic as I was, to the deteſted gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor; who as I have been ſince informed, received ſuch kind of acknowledgments from the ſeamen, for protecting them in their illegal and piratical captures.</p>
               <p>"The wretch, as well as I remember, ſeemed total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſenſible to my miſery; and, with a ſmile upon his countenance, ordered his domeſtics to convey me to my apartments. Theſe, indeed, wanted neither el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>egance nor convenience; but I deſpiſed the one, and neglected the other. The firſt evening I paſſed in the moſt painful anguiſh for the loſs of Solyman, and the moſt dreadful apprehenſions of injurious treatment from the governor. The women that were about me, ſeemed the wretched remains of ruined innocence, who had firſt been victims to the deſires of the tyrant, and afterwards made his ſlaves. Dreadful was the ſcene I had before me! Some of theſe unhappy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſeemed to pity me, and to be concerned for my
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030671_0066_0FE85BFB9F206628"/>
approaching misfortunes; while others, who with their virtue had loſt their humanity, looked upon me with a careleſs ſcorn; pleaſed, I fear, with the tho't, that they ſhould ſee one woman more, as miſerable and as deſpicable as themſelves.</p>
               <p>"Early the next morning, the governor came into my apartment; and caſting his eyes upon the bed on which I had not repoſed, "it ſeems, madam," ſaid he, with a ſcornful ſmile, "that you approve not of your lodgings; but a little time, it is to be preſumed, will reconcile you to us." Theſe morning viſits he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly paid me; and as he always found me in ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſorrow, he behaved much in the ſame manner. At laſt, he changed his addreſs; ſeemed to pity me; aſked me for the ſtory of my misfortunes; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve wept, when he heard it; but as I was aware of the hypocrite, I was equally regardleſs of his pity, as I had been of his ſcorn: and ſtill continued to look upon him, with the ſame forbidding averſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain.</p>
               <p>"Thus paſſed my days in this confinement: but they would have been more intolerable, had I not found a harp in my apartments, which probably had been left there by ſome unhappy lady, who had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed them before me. With this inſtrument I amuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed myſelf for many a melancholy hour, which muſt otherwiſe have paſſed away in the moſt miſerable lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor, I alſo compoſed a ſong, ſuitable to my ſtate of mind and misfortune; which I adapted to my harp, and which, I think, was as follows:</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXV.</head>
               <p>THE travellers had now proceeded on their way to the valley of Irwan, as far as the village of Abdat; where Solyman propoſed that they ſhould viſit the lovers who owed their preſervation to him. Of this he was the more deſirous; as he had never ſeen them, ſince he had firſt recommended them to the protection of his father; but the pleaſure he propoſed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from this viſit, aroſe not from a deſire of being flattered with their acknowledgments, but of behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enjoying their happineſs.</p>
               <p>The lovers received their benefactor, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ardor of gratitude; but at the ſame time with that delicacy, which proved it to be ſincere: they were not loud in their acknowledgments, nor officious in their compliments; but yet their attention to their gueſt, ſhewed how much they were delighted with this opportunity of expreſſing their reſpect for Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The travellers, in the mean time, were not leſs pleaſed to behold the peculiar happineſs of the lovers, who ſeemed to have but one heart, and one inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Solyman and Almena beheld, in them, a pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of themſelves; and felt more ſenſibly their own felicity, when they had before them ſo pleaſing an image of it.</p>
               <p>The merchant too was delighted with this ſcene of conjugal happineſs. "Such," ſaid he to Solyman, "are the genuine fruits of thoſe alliances, which are made by love. When I behold them, I bluſh for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and for my countrymen; for love, genuine love, as if it were no longer a paſſion eſſential to human nature, is looked upon as an Utopian idea, exiſting on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the imagination of poets and enthuſiaſts: hence, every tendency to it is ridiculed as romantic, and modern marriages are only contracts of convenience. A Britiſh lady is expoſed to ſale; and if ſhe has a good perſon, as well as an ample fortune ſhe hopes by
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030671_0069_0FE85C04900593E8"/>
that addition only to fetch a higher price, and make a better market. This, however, it muſt be owned, is not the foible of the women only, the men are equally, if not more mercenary; and have if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, more ſelfiſh views in their marriages; ſo that, in this caſe, cunning is only oppoſed to cunning. All this proceeds from that miſchievous opinion, which meaſures happineſs by the poſſeſſions of fortune. Hence, that mutual coldneſs and indifference, which both experience before the marriage torch is extinct: from new acquiſitions of wealth, each expects new degrees of felicity, and both are diſappointed; when they find themſelves miſtaken, deſtitute of that affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate tenderneſs which endears the married ſtate, they look upon each other as the cauſe of diſcontent, and diſguſt and averſion ſucceed. Thus they ſacrifice to vanity, and reap the fruits of it!"</p>
               <p>From the village of Abdat, Solyman and Almena, with their friend the merchant, proceeded to the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Irwan, where they found the aged Ardavan ſtill living, and enjoying all the faculties of nature. The benevolent ſage rejoiced to receive his ſon, not only ſafe from the dangers of travel, but happy in the enjoyment of his love; and with a heart full of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, he thus conferred on both, his paternal bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:</p>
               <p>"Children of the heart, and comfort of the years of Ardavan! Solyman ſhall be as the ſun, when he cometh from the chambers of the eaſt, when he ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his glories over the waves of Ganges; my ſon ſhall be as the Euphrates, the river of plenty, whoſe waves are the delight of a thouſand meadows; he ſhall be like the roe upon the mountains, that danceth in the vigor of his heart, and ſaith to the fence of the huſbandman, "What art thou?" His head ſhall be crowned with the rays of Mithra; becauſe his heart melted with compaſſion, and becauſe his hand was ſtretched forth to relieve the children of affliction!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:030671_0070_0FE85C5C223629D8"/>"Almena is fairer than the women of the eaſt; ſhe is more virtuous than the daughters of men: love dwelleth in her heart, and benevolence ſitteth in her eye. She ſhall be like the tree that droppeth balm up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the flowers of Irwan; as the ſtar of the evening reflected from the river. Her countenance ſhall be pleaſant as the calm ſurface of the ocean, when the gilded clouds of evening blaze upon its boſom: ſhe ſhall be as the moon, when ſhe lendeth her rays to the traveller, and ſheddeth a mild light over the groves and vallies. Her voice ſhall be as the voice of the turtle, calling to her mate in the thickets of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Like the ſtars that ſurround the chariot of the moon, ſhall be the children of Almena; beautiful as the plants of the cedar, and ſprightly as the fawns upon the mountains!"</p>
               <p>Thus bleſſed by the voice of Ardavan, and happy in themſelves, the virtuous Solyman and Almena live in the valley of Irwan! Each day is endeared by the delights of tender love; and the remembrance of paſt diſtreſſes is attended only with the pleaſing ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of gratitude to that Being, whoſe providence is over all his works.</p>
