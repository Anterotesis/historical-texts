            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THESE words contain the ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of King Agrippa, which having ſome reference to what went before, it may not be improper to relate to you the ſubſtance of the preceding verſes, to which theſe words are ſo cloſely connected. The chapter, then, out of which the text is taken, contains an admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able account the great St. Paul gave of his wonderful converſion from Judaiſm to Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, when he was called to make his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence before Feſtus and another Gentile go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor.—Our bleſſed Lord had long ſince fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that, <hi>when the</hi> SON OF MAN <hi>ſhould be lifted up, his diſciples ſhould be brought before kings for his name's ſake, for a teſtimony unto them;</hi>— and very good was the deſign of Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in thus ordaining it, for Chriſtianity being, from the very beginning, a doctrine of the croſs, the princes and rulers of the earth tho't themſelves too high to be inſtructed by ſuch mean teachers, or too happy to be diſturbed by ſuch unwelcome truths, and, therefore, would have always continued ſtrangers to Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified, had not the apoſtles, by being

arraigned before them as criminals, gained op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of preaching to them Jeſus and the reſurrection. St. Paul knew full well that this was the main reaſon why his bleſſed Maſter, at this time, permitted his enemies to arraign him at a public bar, and, therefore, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the divine will, thinks it not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent barely to make his defence, but endeavors, at the ſame time, to convert his judges. And this he did with ſuch demonſtration of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and of power, that Feſtus, unwilling to be convinced by the ſtrongeſt evidence, cries out, with a loud voice—<hi>Much learning doth make thee mad</hi>—to which the brave apoſtle, like a true follower of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>poſſible he might complete his wiſhed-for converſion, he, with an inimitable ſtrain of oratory, addreſſes himſelf ſtill more cloſely <hi>King Agrippa, believeſt thou the prophets? I know that thou believeſt them:</hi> At which the paſſions of the king began to work ſo ſtrongly, that he was obliged, in open court, to own him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affected by the priſoner's preaching, and ingenuouſly to cry out, <hi>Paul, almoſt thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuadeſt me to be a Chriſtian;</hi> which words taken
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028080_0004_0FD69625878D5598"/>
with the context, afford us a lively repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the different reception the doctrine of Chriſt's miniſters, who come in the power and ſpirit of St. Paul, meets with now a-days in the minds of men; for notwithſtanding they, like this great apoſtle, ſpeak forth the words of truth and ſoberneſs, and with ſuch energy and power, that all their adverſaries cannot juſtly gainſay or reſiſt, yet too many, with the moſt noble Feſtus before-mentioned, being like him, either too proud to be taught, or too ſenſual, too careleſs, or too worldly-minded to live up to their doctrine, in order to excuſe themſelves, cry out, that much learning, much ſtudy, or what is more unaccountable, much piety hath made them mad; and though, bleſſed be God, all do not thus diſbelieve our report, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe many others, who gladly receive the word, and confeſs that we ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs, there are ſo few, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at any higher degree of piety than that of Agrippa, or are any farther perſuaded than to be almoſt Chriſtians, that I cannot but think it highly neceſſary to warn my dear hearers of the danger of ſuch a ſtate; and therefore, from the words of the text, ſhall endeavor to conſider theſe three things:
<list>
                  <item>I. What is meant by an almoſt Chriſtian.</item>
                  <item>II. What are the chief reaſons why ſo many are no more than almoſt Chriſtians.</item>
                  <item>III. I ſhall conſider the ineffectualneſs, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, abſurdity, and uneaſineſs that attends thoſe that are but almoſt Chriſtians.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028080_0005_0FD6962E108B32F0"/>IV. I ſhall conclude with a general exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to ſet all upon ſtriving not only to be almoſt, but altogether Chriſtians.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. And firſt I am to conſider what is meant by an almoſt Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>An almoſt Chriſtian, then, if we conſider him in reſpect to his duty to God, is one that halts between two opinions, that wavers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the world, that would recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile God and Mammon, that is, light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Chriſt and B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lial. It is true, he has an inclination to religion, but then he is very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious how he goes too far in it: His falſe heart is always crying out—Spare thyſelf, do thyſelf no harm. He prays, indeed, that God's <hi>will may be done on earth, as it is in heaven;</hi> but then, notwithſtanding he is very partial in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and fondly hopes that God will not be extreme to mark every thing that he wilfully does amiſs, though an inſpired apoſtle has told him, that he that <hi>offends in one point is guilty of all.</hi> Above all, he is one that depends much on outward ordinances, and upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count looks upon himſelf as righteous, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes others; though, at the ſame time, he may be as great a ſtranger to the divine life, as any other perſon whatſoever. In ſhort, he is fond of the form, but never experiences the power of godlineſs in his heart: He goes on, year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter year, feeding and attending on the means of grace; but then, like Pharaoh's lean kine, is never the better, but rather the worſe for them.</p>
            <p>If you conſider him in reſpect to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028080_0006_0FD6963010AB2A88"/>
he is one that is ſtrictly juſt to all; but then this does not proceed from any love <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o God, or regard to man, but only out of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of ſelf love, becauſe he knows diſhoneſty will ſpoil his reputation, and conſequently hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his thriving in the world.</p>
            <p>He is one that depends much on being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively good, and contents himſelf with the conſciouſneſs of having done no one any harm, though he reads in the goſpel, that <hi>the unprofit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervant was caſt into outer darkneſs,</hi> and the barren ſig-tree curſed and dried up from the roots, not for bearing bad, but no fruit.</p>
            <p>He is no enemy to charitable contributions in public, if not too frequently recommended; but then he is unacquainted with the kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of <hi>viſiting the ſick and impriſoned, cloathing the naked, and relieving the hungry</hi> in a private manner. He thinks that theſe things belong only to the clergy, though his own falſe heart tells him, that nothing but pride keeps him from exerciſing theſe acts of humility, and that Jeſus Chriſt, in the xxvth chapter of St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, condemns perſons to everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not for being fornicators, drunkards, or extortioners, but for neglecting theſe charitable offices. <hi>When the Son of Man,</hi> ſays our bleſſed Lord himſelf, <hi>ſhall come in his glory, he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, and the goals on his left. And then ſhall he ſay to them on his left hand, Depart from me, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels: For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was thirſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028080_0007_0FD696348A748768"/>
and ye gave me no drink; I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye cloathed me not; ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not. Then ſhall they alſo ſay, Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungred, or athirſt, or a ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and did not miniſter unto thee? Then ſhall be anſwer them, Verily, I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye have not done it unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye did it not unto me: And theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment.</hi> I thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to give you this whole paſſage of ſcripture at large, becauſe our Saviour lays ſuch a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſtreſs upon it; and yet, notwithſtanding it is ſo little regarded, that were we to judge by the practice of Chriſtians, one ſhould be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think there were no ſuch verſes in the Bible.</p>
            <p>But to proceed in our character of an almoſt Chriſtian. If we conſider him in reſpect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as before we ſaid he was ſtrictly honeſt to his neighbor, ſo he is likewiſe ſtrictly ſober in himſelf; but then both his honeſty and ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty proceed from the ſame principle of a falſe ſelf love. It is true he runs not into the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of roit with other men, but then it is not out of obedience to the laws of God, but either becauſe his conſtitution will not away with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, or rather becauſe he is cautious of forfeiting his reputation, or unfitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for temporal buſineſs. But though he is ſo prudent as to avoid intemperance and exceſs, for the reaſons before-mentioned, yet he always goes to the extremity of what is lawful. It is
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028080_0008_0FD69636E87D8250"/>
true, he is no drunkard, but then he has no Chriſtian ſelf-denial. He cannot think our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to be ſo auſtere a maſter, as to deny us to indulge ourſelves in ſome particulars; and ſo by this means he is kept out of a ſenſe of true religion, as much as if he lived in debauchery, or any other crime whatever. As to ſettling his principles as well as practice, he is guided more by the world, than by the word of God. As for his part, he cannot think the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo narrow as ſome would make it; and, therefore, conſiders not ſo much what ſcripture requires, as what ſuch and ſuch a good man does, or what will beſt ſuit his own corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. Upon this account, he is not only very cautious himſelf, but likewiſe very careful of young converts, whoſe faces are ſet heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and, therefore, is always acting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's part, and bidding them ſpare themſelves, though they are doing no more than what the ſcripture ſtrictly requires them to do; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which is, that he ſuffers not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to enter into the kingdom of God, and thoſe that are entering in he hinders.</p>
            <p>Thus lives the almoſt Chriſtian; not that I can ſay I have fully deſcribed him to you, but, from theſe out-lines and ſketches of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, if your conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028080_0009_0FD6963A1D4754B0"/>
at the ſame time, that you join with the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the words immediately following the text, and wiſh yourſelves not only almoſt, but altogether Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But I proceed to the ſecond general thing propoſed, namely, to conſider the reaſons why ſo many are no more than almoſt Chriſtians.</p>

And the firſt reaſon I ſhall mention is— becauſe ſo many ſet out with falſe notions of religion, and though they live in a Chriſtian country, yet know not what Chriſtianity is.— This, perhaps may be eſteemed a hard ſaying, but experience ſadly evinces the truth of it; for ſome place religion in being of this or that communion, more in morality, moſt in a round of duties, and a model of performances, and few, very few, acknowledge it to be what it really is, a thorough inward change of nature, a divine life, a vital participation of Jeſus Chriſt, an union of the ſoul with God, which the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle expreſſes by ſaying, <hi>He that is joined to the Lord is one ſpirit.</hi> Hence it happens that ſo many, even of the moſt knowing profeſſors, when you come to converſe with them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eſſence, the life, the ſoul of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I mean our new birth in Jeſus Chriſt, confeſs themſelves quite ignorant of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and cry out with Nicodemus, <hi>How can this thing be?</hi> And no wonder then, that ſo many are only almoſt Chriſtians, when ſo many know not what Chriſtianity is: No marvel ſo many take up with the form, when they are quite ſtrangers to the power of godlineſs, or content themſelves
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028080_0010_0FD6963B492C7ED8"/>
with the ſhadow, when they know ſo little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſubſtance of it. And this is one cauſe why ſo many are almoſt, why ſo few are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond reaſon that may be aſſigned why ſo many are no more than almoſt Chriſtians, is a ſervile fear of man Multitudes there are, and have been, who, though awakened to a ſenſe of the divine life, and <hi>have taſted and felt the powers of the world to come,</hi> yet out of a baſe, ſinful fear of being counted ſingular, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of men, have ſuffered all thoſe good impreſſions to wear off again. It is true, they have ſome eſteem for Jeſus Chriſt, but then, like Nicodemus, they would <hi>come to him</hi> only <hi>by night:</hi> They are willing to ſerve him, but then they would do it <hi>ſecretly, for fear of the Jews:</hi> They <hi>have a mind to ſee Jeſus,</hi> but then <hi>they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to him becauſe of the preſs;</hi> for fear of being laughed at, and ridiculed by thoſe with whom they uſed to ſit at meat. But well did our Saviour propheſy of ſuch perſons, <hi>How can ye love me which receive honor one of another?</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! have they never read, that <hi>the friendſhip of this world is enmity with God;</hi> and that our Lord himſelf has threatened, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of me, or of my words, in this wicked and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous generation, of him ſhall the Son of Man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father, and of his holy angels.</hi> But no wonder that ſo many are no more that almoſt Chriſtians, ſince ſo many <hi>love the praiſe of men more than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor which cometh of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:028080_0011_0FD6963E66D9C918"/>3. A third reaſon why ſo many are no more than almoſt Chriſtians, is a reigning love of money. This was the pitiable caſe of that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward young man in the goſpel, who came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to our bleſſed Lord, and kneeling before him, enquired what <hi>he muſt do to inherit eternal life;</hi> to which our bleſſed Maſter replied, <hi>Thou knoweſt the commandments, do not kill, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery, do not ſteal;</hi> to which the young man replied, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth.</hi> But when our Lord proceeded to tell him, <hi>Yet lackeſt thou one thing, go ſell all that thou haſt and give to the poor; he was grieved at that ſaying, and went away ſorrowful, for he had great poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions!</hi> Poor youth! he had a good mind to be a Chriſtian, and to inherit eternal life, but tho't it too dear, if it could be purchaſed at no leſs an expence than of his whole eſtate! And thus many, both young and old, now-a-days, come running to worſhip our bleſſed Lord in public, and kneel before him in private, and enquire at his goſpel, what muſt they do to inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; but when they find they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> renounce the ſelf-enjoyment of riches, and forſake all in affection to follow him, they cry—The Lord pardon us in this thing!—We pray thee have us excuſed.</p>
            <p>But is heaven ſo ſmall a trifle in ſuch men's eſteem, as not to be worth a little gilded earth? Is eternal life ſo mean a purchaſe, as not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the temporary renunciation of a few tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory riches? Sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly it is. But however incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent ſuch a behaviour may be, this inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028080_0012_0FD696449F657DA8"/>
love of money is too evidently the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and fatal cauſe, why ſo many are no more than almoſt Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor is the reigning love of pleaſure a leſs uncommon, or a leſs fatal cauſe, why ſo many are no more than almoſt Chriſtians. Thouſands and ten thouſands there are, who deſpiſe rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and would willingly be true diſciples of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, would parting with their money make them ſo; but when they are told, that our bleſſed Lord has ſaid, that <hi>whoſoever will come after him muſt deny himſelf.</hi> Like the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable young man, before-mentioned, <hi>they go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſorrowful;</hi> for they have too great a love for ſenſual pleaſures. They will, like Herod, perhaps ſend for the miniſters of Chriſt, as he did for John, and <hi>hear them gladly;</hi> but touch them in their Herodias, tell them they muſt part with ſuch or ſuch a darling pleaſure, and with wicked Ahab they cry out—<hi>Haſt thou found us, O our enemy?</hi> Tell them of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of mortification, faſting, and ſelf-denial, and it is as difficult to them to hear, as if you was to bid them cut off a right hand or pluck out a right eye: They cannot think our bleſſed Lord requires ſo much at their hands, though an inſpired apoſtle has commanded us to <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify our members which are upon earth;</hi> and he himſelf, even after he had converted millions, and was very near arrived to the end of his race, yet profeſſed that it was his daily practice to <hi>keep under his body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028080_0013_0FD69646375B5748"/>
after he had preached to others, he himſelf ſhould be a caſt-away!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome men would be wiſer than this great apoſtle, and chalk out to us what they falſely imagine an eaſier way to happineſs. They would flatter us we may go to heaven without offering violence to our ſenſual appetites, and <hi>enter into the ſtrait gate</hi> without ſtriving againſt our carnal inclinations. And this is another reaſon why ſo many are only almoſt, and not altogether Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fifth and laſt reaſon I ſhall aſſign why ſo many are only almoſt Chriſtians, is a ſickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and inſtability of temper.</p>
            <p>It has been, no doubt, the misfortune that many a miniſter and ſincere Chriſtian has met with, to weep and wail over numbers of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing converts, who ſeemingly began in the ſpirit, but after a while have fell away, and baſely ended in the fleſh, and this not for want of right notions in religion, nor out of a ſervile fear of man, nor out of love of money or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſure, but out of an inſtability and ſickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of temper. They looked upon religion merely for novelty, as ſomething which pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for a while, but after their curioſity was ſatisfied, they have laid it aſide again. Like the young man that came to ſee Jeſus, with a linen cloth about his naked body, they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him for a ſeaſon, but when temptations have come to take hold on them, for want of a little more reſolution, they have been ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all their good intentions, and fled away
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028080_0014_0FD696480BBEB2D8"/>
naked. They at firſt, like a tree planted by the water-ſide, grew up and flouriſhed for a while, but having no root in themſelves, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of holineſs and piety, like Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's gourd, were ſoon <hi>dried up, cut down, and withered.</hi> Their good intentions are but too like the violent motions of the animal ſpirits of a body newly beheaded, which, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, are not laſting. In ſhort, they ſet out well in their journey to heaven, but finding the way either narrower or longer than they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, through an unſteadineſs of temper, they have made an eternal halt, and ſo <hi>returned like the dog to his vomit, or like the ſow that was waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to her wallowing in the mire!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I tremble to pronounce the fate of ſuch unſtable profeſſors, <hi>who, having put their hands to the plow,</hi> for want of a little more reſolution, ſhamefully look back. How ſhall I repeat to them that dreadful threatening, <hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him:</hi> And again, <hi>It is impoſſible,</hi> that is, exceedingly diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult at leaſt, <hi>for thoſe that have been once enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and have taſted the good gift of God's holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the powers of the world to come, if they ſhould fall away, to be renewed again unto repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> But notwithſtanding the goſpel is ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt apoſtates, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et many that begun well, through a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>kleneſs of temper, (Oh that none of us here preſent may ever be ſuch!) have been, by this means, of <hi>the number of thoſe that turn back unto perdition.</hi> And this is the fifth and laſt reaſon I ſhall give, why ſo many are only almoſt, and not altogether Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028080_0015_0FD628B9828F9808"/>III. Proceed now to the third general thing propoſed, namely, to conſider the folly of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more than an almoſt Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>And the firſt proof I ſhall give of the folly of ſuch a proceeding is—that it is ineffectual to ſalvation. It is true, ſuch men are almoſt good, but almoſt to hit the mark, is really to miſs it. God requires us to <hi>love him with all our hearts, with all our ſouls, and with all our ſtrength:</hi> He loves us too well to admit any rival, becauſe ſo far as our hearts are empty of God, ſo far muſt they be unhappy. The Devil, indeed, like the falſe mother that came before Solomon, would have our hearts divided, as ſhe would have had the child, but God, like the true mother, will have all or none. <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart,</hi> thy whole heart, is the general call to all; and if this be not done, we never can expect the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy.</p>
            <p>Perſons may play the hypocrite, but God, at the great day, will ſtrike them dead, (as he did Ananias and Sapphira by the mouth of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Peter) for pretending to offer him all their hearts, when they keep back from him the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part. They may, perhaps, impoſe upon their fellow-creatures for a while, but he that enabled Elijah to cry out, <hi>Come in thou wife of Jeroboam,</hi> when ſhe came diſguiſed to enquire about her ſick ſon, will alſo diſcover them through their moſt artful diſſimulations, and if <hi>their hearts are not whole with him, appoint them their portion with hypocrites and unbelievers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> what renders an half-way piety
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028080_0016_0FD69651F1DDABB8"/>
more inexcuſable is, that it is not only inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to our own ſalvation, but alſo moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to that of others.</p>
            <p>An almoſt Chriſtian is one of the moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful creatures in the world; he is a wolf in ſheep's cloathing—he is one of thoſe falſe prophets our bleſſed Lord bids us beware of in his ſermon on the mount, who would perſuade men, that the way to heaven is broader than it really is; and thereby, as it was obſerved before, <hi>enter not into the kingdom of God themſelves, and thoſe that are entering in they hinder.</hi> Theſe, theſe are the men that turn the world into a lukewarm Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean ſpirit—that hang out fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe lights, and ſo ſhipwreck unthinking benighted ſouls in their voyage to the haven of eternity. Theſe are they that are greater enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, than infidels themſelves; for of an unbeliever every one will be aware, but an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Chriſtian, through his ſubtle hypocriſy, draws away many after him, and therefore muſt expect to receive the greater damnation.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>thirdly,</hi> as it is moſt prejudicial to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and hurtful to others, ſo it is the greateſt piece of ingratitude we can expreſs towards our Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt. For did he come down from heaven, and ſhed his precious blood, to purchaſe theſe hearts of ours, and ſhall we only give him half of them? Oh how can we ſay we love him, when our hearts are not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him? How can we call him our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, when we will not endeavor ſincerely to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:028080_0017_0FD6965353A455E8"/>
approve ourſelves to him, and ſo let him ſee the travail of his ſoul, and be ſatisfied!</p>
            <p>Had any of us purchaſed a ſlave at a moſt expenſive rate, that was before involved in the utmoſt miſeries and torments, and ſo muſt have continued for ever, had we ſhut up our bowels of compaſſion from him; and was this ſlave af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to grow rebellious, or deny giving us but half his ſervice—how, how ſhould we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt his baſe ingratitude? And yet this baſe ungrateful ſlave thou art, O man, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeſt thyſelf to be redeemed from infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite unavoidable miſery and puniſhment by the death of Jeſus Chriſt, and yet wilt not give thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to him. But ſhall we deal with God, our Maker, in a manner we would not be dealt with by a man, like ourſelves? God forbid!— No.</p>
            <p>That I may come to the laſt thing propoſed, namely, to add a word or two of exhortation to be not only almoſt, but altogether Chriſtians, let us ſcorn all ſuch baſe and treacherous treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our King and Saviour—nay, our God. Let us not take ſome pains all our lives to go to heaven, and yet plunge ourſelves into hell at laſt. Let us give God our whole hearts, and no longer halt between two opinions: If the world be God, let us ſerve that—If pleaſure be a God, let us ſerve that; but if the Lord, he be God, let us—Oh let us ſerve him alone! Alas! why, why ſhould we ſtand out any longer?— Why ſhould we be ſo in love with ſlavery, as not wholly to renounce the world, the fleſh, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028080_0018_0FD6965682E50338"/>
the Devil, which, like ſo many ſpiritual chains, bind down our ſouls, and hinder them from fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to God. Alas! what are we afraid of? Is not God able to reward our entire obedience? If he is, as the almoſt Chriſtian's lame way of ſerving him ſeems to grant—Why, then, will we not ſerve him entirely? For the ſame reaſon we do ſo much, why do we not do more? Or do you think that being only half religious will make you happy, but that going farther will render you miſerable and uneaſy? Alas! this, my brethren, is deluſion all over; for what is it but this half piety—this wavering between God and the world, that makes ſo many that are ſeemingly well diſpoſed, ſuch utter ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the comforts of religion? They choſe juſt ſo much of religion as will diſturb them in their luſts, and follow their luſts ſo far as to deprive themſelves of the comforts of religion: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, on the contrary, would they ſincerely leave all in affection, and give their hearts wholly to God, they would then (and they cannot till then) experience the unſpeakable pleaſure of having a mind at unity with itſelf, and enjoy ſuch a peace of God, which, even in this life, paſſes all underſtanding, and which they were entire ſtrangers to before. It is true, if we will devote ourſelves entirely to God, we muſt meet with contempt, but then it is becauſe contempt is neceſſary to heal our pride. We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> pleaſure, but then it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe unfit us for ſpiritual ones, which are infinitely better. We muſt renounce the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028080_0019_0FD69657D088BE08"/>
love of the world, but then it is that we may be filled with the love of God: And when that has once enlarged our hearts, we ſhall, like Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, when he ſerved for his beloved Rachel, think nothing too difficult to undergo, no hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips too tedious to endure, becauſe of the love we ſhall then have for our dear Redeemer.— Thus eaſy, thus delightful will be the ways of God even in this life; but when once we throw off theſe bodies, and our ſouls are filled with all the fullneſs of God, Oh! what heart can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what tongue can expreſs, with what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy and conſolation we ſhall then look back on our paſt ſincere and hearty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. Think you then, my dear hearers, we ſhall repent we had done too much; or rather think you not we ſhall be aſhamed that we did no more, and bluſh we were ſo backward to give up all to God, when he intended hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to give us himſelf?</p>
            <p>Let me, therefore, to conclude, exhort you, my brethren, to have always the unſpeakable happineſs of enjoying God ſet before you: And think withal, that every degree of holineſs you neglect—every inſtance of piety you paſs by, is a jewel taken out of your crown, a degree of bleſſedneſs loſt in the viſion of God.

            <p>Some forget this duty of praying for others, becauſe they ſeldom remember to pray for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and even good people, who are conſtant in praying to their Father, which is in heaven, are often ſo conſtrained and ſelfiſh in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the throne of grace, that they do not enlarge their petitions for the welfare of their fellow Chriſtians as they ought, and thereby fall ſhort of attaining that Chriſtian charity, that unfeigned love of their brethren, which their ſac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus earneſt, thus importunate, are all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Chriſtians in praying for themſelves; but then, not having ſo lively, laſting, and deep a ſenſe of the wants of their Chriſtian brethren, they are, for the moſt part, too remiſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in their prayers for them; whereas was the love of God ſhed abroad in our hearts, and did we love our neighbor in that manner in which the Son of God, our Saviour loved us, and according to his command and example, we could not but be as importunate for their ſpiritual and temporal welfare, as for our own, and as earneſtly deſire and endeavor that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould ſhare in the benefits of the death and paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt as we ourſelves.</p>
            <p>Let not any one think, that this is an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon degree of charity, an high pitch of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which every one cannot attain unto, ſince it is no ſuch thing:—For if we are all commanded to <hi>love our neighbor,</hi> that is every m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028080_0024_0FD69663CF541A50"/>
and by all poſſible acts and expreſſions of love and affection towards them, at all times, to ſhew their readineſs even to lay down their lives for them, if ever it ſhould pleaſe God to call them to it.</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Saviour, as he hath ſet us an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that we ſhould follow his ſteps in every thing elſe, ſo hath he more eſpecially in this: For in that moſt divine, that moſt perfect and inimitable prayer, recorded in the xviith of St. John, which he put up juſt before his paſſion, we find but few petitions for his own, though many for his diſciples' welfare: And in that moſt perfect form which he has been pleaſed to preſcribe us, we are taught to ſay—not <hi>my,</hi> but <hi>our Father;</hi> thereby to put us in mind, that, whenever we approach the throne of grace, we ought to pray not for ourſelves alone, but for all our brethren in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Interceſſion then is certainly a duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon all Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Whom we are to intercede for, and how this duty is to be performed, comes next to be conſidered, under my ſecond general head.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt, our interceſſion muſt be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal. <hi>I will,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>that prayers, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and interceſſions be made for all men:</hi> For as <hi>God's mercy is over all his works,</hi> as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt died to redeem a people out of all nations and languages;</hi> ſo we ſhould I pray, that <hi>all men may come to the knowledge of the truth, and be ſaved.</hi> — Many precious promiſes are made in holy writ, that <hi>the goſpel ſhall be publiſhed through the whole
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:028080_0025_0FD6966B9409C2C0"/>
world,</hi> that <hi>the earth ſhall be covered with the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea:</hi> And therefore it is our duty not to confine our petitions to our own nation, but to pray that all thoſe nations, who now ſit in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death, may have the glorious goſpel ſhine out upon them, as well as upon us. But you need not that any man ſhould teach you this, ſince ye yourſelves are taught of God, even of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, to pray, that his kingdom may come; part of the meaning of which petition is, that God's ways may be known upon earth, and his ſaving health a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all nations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Next to the praying for all men, we ſhould, according to St. Paul's rule, pray for thoſe in au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hority, that we may lead quiet lives, in all godlineſs and honeſty. For if we conſider how heavy the burden of government is, and how much the welfare of any people depends on the zeal and godly converſation of thoſe that have the rule over them: If we ſet before us the many dangers and difficulties to which gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, by their ſtation, are expoſed, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual temptations they lie under to luxury and ſelf-indulgence, we ſhall not only pity but pray for them—that he who preſerved Eſther, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and Joſiah <hi>unſpotted from the world,</hi> amidſt the grandeur of a court, and gave ſucceſs to their deſigns, would alſo preſerve them holy and unblamable, and proſper all the works of their hands upon them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But, <hi>thirdly,</hi> you ought, in a more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028080_0026_0FD6966D68AFC968"/>
manner, to pray for thoſe, whom <hi>the Holy Ghoſt hath made overſeers over you.</hi> This is what St. Paul begs, again and again, of the churches to whom he writes. <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſays he in the text, <hi>pray for us;</hi> and again, in his epiſtle to the Epheſians—<hi>Praying always,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with all manner of ſupplication; and for me alſo, that I may open my mouth boldly, to declare the myſtery of the goſpel.</hi> And in another place, to expreſs his earneſtneſs in this requeſt, and the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of their prayers to him, he bids the church <hi>ſtrive,</hi> or, as the original word ſignifies, <hi>be in an agony, together with him in their prayers.</hi> And ſurely, if the great St. Paul, that choſen veſſel, that favorite of heaven, needed the moſt importunate prayers of his Chriſtian converts, much more do the ordinary miniſters of the goſpel ſtand in need of the interceſſion of their reſpective flocks.</p>
            <p>And I cannot but, in a more eſpecial manner, inſiſt upon this branch of your duty, becauſe it is a matter of ſuch importance; for, no doubt, much good is frequently with-held from many by reaſon of their neglecting to pray for their miniſters, which they would have received, had they prayed for them as they ought. Not to mention, that people often complain of the want of diligent and faithful paſtors: But how do they deſerve good paſtors, who will not ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pray to God for ſuch.</p>
            <p>The church has ſet apart four ſeaſons in the year for this purpoſe, and to call down a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on thoſe who are to be ordained to any
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028080_0027_0FD6966E558B84A8"/>
holy function; but by how very few are the <hi>ember days</hi> obſerved! And if we will not <hi>pray to the Lord of the harveſt,</hi> can it be expected, <hi>he will ſend forth laborers into his harveſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, what ingratitude is it, not to pray for your miniſters! For ſhall they watch and labor in the word and doctrine for you, and for your ſalvation, and ſhall not you pray for them in return? If any beſtow favors on your bodies, you think it right, meet, and your bounden duty, to pray for them; and ſhall not they be remembered in your prayers, who daily feed and nouriſh your ſouls? Add to all this, that praying for your miniſters will be a manifeſt proof of your believing, that though Paul plant and Apollos water, yet it is God alone who giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the increaſe. And you will alſo find it the beſt means you can uſe, to promote your own welfare; becauſe God, in anſwer to your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, may impart a double portion of his Holy Spirit to them, whereby they will be qualified to deal out to you larger meaſures of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſpiritual things, and be enabled more ſkilfully to divide the word of truth.</p>
            <p>Would men but conſtantly obſerve this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and when their miniſters are praying in their name to God, humbly beſeech him to perform all their petitions: Or, when they are ſpeaking in God's name to them, pray that <hi>the Holy Ghoſt may fall on all them that hear the word;</hi> we ſhall then find a more viſible good effect of their doctrine, and a greater mutual love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028080_0028_0FD6966FCC22F6D0"/>
miniſters and their people. For miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters' hands would then be held up by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's interceſſions, and the people will never dare to vilify or traduce thoſe who are the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſubjects of their prayers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Next to our miniſters, our friends claim a pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e in our interceſſions; but then we ſhould not content ourſelves with praying in general terms for them, but ſuit our prayers to their particular circumſtances. When Meriam was affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For inſtance—is a friend ſick? We ſhould pray, that if it be God's good pleaſure, it may not be unto death; but if otherwiſe, that he would give him grace, ſo to take his viſitation, that, after this painful life ended, he may dwell with him in life everlaſting. Is a friend in doubt, in a matter? We ſhould lay his caſe before God, as Moſes did that of the daughters of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lophehad, and pray, that God's Holy Spirit may lead him into all truth. Is he in w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

difficult duty, yet not impracticable to thoſe who have renounced the things of this preſent life, (from an inordinate love of which alone all enmities ariſe) and who, knowing the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woes denounced againſt thoſe who offend Chriſt's little ones, can, out of real pity, and a ſenſe of their danger, pray for thoſe by whom ſuch offences come.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, and to conclude this head, we ſhould intercede for all that are any ways af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in mind, body, or eſtate; for all who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and ſtand in need of our prayers, and for all who do not pray for themſelves.</p>
            <p>And Oh! that all who hear me, would ſet apart ſome time every day for the due perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this moſt neceſſary duty!—In order to which,</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to the third general thing propoſed, namely,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhew the advantages, and offer ſome conſiderations to excite you to the practice of daily interceſſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And <hi>firſt,</hi> it will fill you hearts with love one to another. He that every day hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly intercedes at the throne of grace for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, cannot but in a ſhort time be filled with love and charity to all; and the frequent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his love in this manner, will inſenſibly enlarge his heart, and make him partaker of that exceeding abundance of it which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord! Envy, malice, revenge and ſuch like helliſh tempers, can never long harbour in a gracious interceſſor's breaſt; but
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:028080_0031_0FD696738CB1A628"/>
he will be filled with joy, peace, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, and all other graces of the holy ſpirit. By frequently laying his neighbour's wants before God, he will be touched with a fellow feeling of them; he will rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with thoſe that weep. Every bleſſing beſtowed on others, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of exciting envy in him, will be looked on as an anſwer to his particular interceſſion, and fill his ſoul with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</p>
            <p>Abound therefore in acts of general and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular interceſſions, and when you hear of your neighbour's faults, inſtead of relating them to, and expoſing them before others, lay them in ſecret before God, and beg of him to correct and amend them. When you hear of a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinner, inſtead of thinking, you do well to be angry, beg of Jeſus Chriſt to convert and make him a monument of his free grace; and you cannot imagine what a bleſſed alteration this practice will make in your heart, and how much you will increaſe, day by day, in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of love and meekneſs towards all mankind!</p>
            <p>But, further to excite you to the conſtant practice of this duty of interceſſion, conſider the many inſtances given us in holy ſcripture of the power and efficacy of it. Great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things are there recorded as the effects of this divine employ. It has ſtopped plagues, it has opened and ſhut heaven, and has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently turned away God's fury from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. How was Abimelech's houſe freed from
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028080_0032_0FD69675957F6718"/>
the diſeaſe God ſent amongſt them, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Abraham! When Phineas ſtood up and prayed, how ſoon did the plague ceaſe!— When Daniel humbled and afflicted his ſoul, and interceded for the Lord's inheritance, how quickly was an angel diſpatched to tell him his prayer was heard! And to mention but one inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ance more, how does God own himſelf, as it were, quite overcome with the importunity of Moſes, when he was interceding for his ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous people—<hi>Let me alone,</hi> ſays God!</p>
            <p>This ſufficiently ſhews, I could almoſt ſay, the omnipotency of interceſſion, and how we may, like Jacob, wreſtle with God, and by an holy violence prevail both for ourſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And no doubt it is owing to the ſecret and prevailing interceſſions of the few righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſouls who ſtill remain among us, that God has yet ſpared this miſerably ſinful nation; for were there not ſome ſuch faithful ones, like Moſes, left to ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d in the gap, we ſhould ſoon be deſtroyed, even as was Sodom, and reduced to aſhes like unto Gomorrah.</p>
            <p>But, to ſtir you up yet farther to this God-like exerciſe of interceſſion, conſider that, in all probability, it is the frequent employment even of the glorified ſaints; for though they are delivered from the burden of the fleſh, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the glorious liberty of the ſons of God, yet as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir happineſs cannot be perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted 'till the reſurrection of the laſt day, when all their brethren will be glorified with them, we cannot but think they are often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028080_0033_0FD6967717C626B0"/>
in beſeeching our heavenly Father ſhortly to accompliſh the number of his elect, and to haſten his kingdom. And ſhall not we, who are on earth, be often exerciſed in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine employ with the glorious company of the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect? Since our happineſs is ſo much to conſiſt in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of ſaints in the church triumphant above, ſhall we not frequently intercede for the church militant here below, and earneſtly beg, that we may all be one, even as the holy Jeſus and his Father are one, that we may alſo be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in one?</p>
            <p>To provoke you to this great work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor of love, remember that it is the never ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employment of the holy and highly exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jeſus himſelf, who ſits at the right hand of God to hear all our prayers, and to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual interceſſion for us! So that he who is conſtantly employed in interceding for others, is doing that on earth, which the eternal Son of God is always doing in heaven.</p>
            <p>Imagine, therefore, when you are lifting up holy hands in prayer for one another, that you ſee the heavens opened, and the Son of God in all his glory, as the great high prieſt of your ſalvation, offering up and pleading for you, the all-ſufficient merit of his ſacrifice before the throne of his heavenly Father? Join then your interceſſions with his, and beſeech him, that they may, through him, come up as incenſe, and be received as a ſweet ſmelling ſavour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the ſight of God! This imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028080_0034_0FD696788AE34310"/>
will ſtrengthen your faith, excite a holy earneſtneſs in your p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>yers, and make you wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with God as Jacob did, when he ſaw him face to face, and his life was preſerved; as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, when he pleaded for Sodom; and as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, when he prayed, being in an agony, ſo much the more earneſtly the night before his bitter paſſion!</p>
            <p>And now, brethren, what ſhall I ſay more, ſince you are t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ught of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf to abound in love, and in this good work of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one for another. Though ever ſo mean, though as poor as Lazarus, you will then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come benefactors to all mankind; thouſands, and twenty times ten thouſands, will then be bleſſed for your ſakes! and after you have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed a few years in this divine exerciſe here, you will be tranſlated to that happy place, where you have ſo often wiſhed others might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, and be exalted to ſit at the right hand of our all-powerful, all-prevailing Interceſſor, in the kingdom of his heavenly Father here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after!</p>
            <p>However, I cannot but in an eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner preſs this upon you now, becauſe all ye, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom I have now been preaching, in all probability will ſee me no more; for I am now going (I truſt under the conduct of God's moſt holy ſpirit) from you, knowing not what ſhall befal me: I need therefore your moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate interceſſions, that nothing may move me from my duty, and that I may not count even my life dear unto myſelf, ſo that I may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

my courſe with joy; and the miniſtry I have received of the Lord Jeſus to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of God!</p>
            <p>Whilſt I have been here, to the beſt of my knowledge I have not failed to declare unto you the whole will of God:—And though my preaching may have been a ſavour of death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death to ſome, yet I truſt it has been alſo a ſavour of life unto l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fe to others; and therefore I earneſtly hope that thoſe will not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me in their prayers. As for my own part, the many unmerited kindneſſes I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you, will not ſuffer me to forget you: Out of the deep, therefore, I truſt, ſhall my cry come unto God, and whilſt the winds and ſtorms are blowing over me, unto the Lord will I make my ſupplication for you. For it is but a little while, and we muſt all appear before the judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, where I muſt give a ſtrict account of the doctrine I have preached, and you of your improvement under it. And Oh! that I may never be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out as a ſwift witneſs againſt any of thoſe, for whoſe ſalvation I have ſincerely, though too faintly, longed and labored!</p>
            <p>It is true, I have been cenſured by ſome as acting out of ſiniſter and ſelfiſh views; but it is a ſmall matter with me to be judged by man's judgment: I hope my eye is ſingle, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, brethren, by the mercies of God in Chriſt Jeſus, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now, brethren, what ſhall I ſay more? I could wiſh to continue my diſcourſe much longer, for I can never fully expreſs the deſire of my ſoul towards you! Finally, therefore, brethren, <hi>Whatſoever things are holy, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are honeſt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are of good report; if there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any fellowſhip of the Spirit,</hi> if any hopes of our appearing to the comfort of each other at the awful tribunal of Jeſus Chriſt, think of the things that you have heard, and of thoſe which your paſtors have declared, and will yet declare unto you: and continue under their miniſtry to <hi>work out your own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling;</hi> ſo that, whether I ſhall ſee you any more, or whether it ſhall pleaſe God to bring me back again at any time, I may always have the ſatisfaction of knowing that your converſation is ſuch as becometh the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt.</p>
