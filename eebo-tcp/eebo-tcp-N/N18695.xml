            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT was the unhappy caſe of Agrippa, that though <hi>almoſt,</hi> he was only <hi>almoſt, perſuaded to be a Chriſtian</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Acts xxvi. 28.</note>; and I fear, it is now the caſe of many, and particularly of many <hi>young perſons,</hi> who have enjoyed the advantages of a religious education. I believe it is difficult to find any amongſt them, who have not been brought under ſome ſerious impreſſions betimes. With regard to the internal operations of the bleſſed Spirit, as well as external means, <hi>the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of life</hi> is generally to them, in a peculiar ſenſe, <hi>the day of their viſitation</hi>; and they often ſeem to know it, and in ſome meaſure to improve it: but in too many inſtances we find their <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as a morning cloud, and as the early dew, which ſoon paſſeth away</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Hoſ. vi. 4.</note>. The bloſſoms open fair and beautiful, and give a very agreeable proſpect of the plentiful fruits of holineſs in life: but too often, when ſtorms of temptation and corruption ariſe, the goodly appearance is laid in ruins; the bloſſoms do as it were fall to the ground, and leave the tree blaſted and naked; or at beſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered only with leaves of an external profeſſion,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024272_0003_0FC5F7EA63760890"/>
which, however green and flouriſhing they may for the preſent be, will not at laſt ſecure it from being <hi>cut down and caſt into the burning.</hi> Though <hi>they</hi> for a while <hi>had eſcaped the pollutions of the world</hi> through luſt, <hi>they are</hi> afterwards <hi>entangled</hi> and ſubdued; and the conſequence is, they prove a ſcandal to religion, and a diſcouragement to others, till, in the end, they bring aggravated deſtruction on themſelves; ſo that on the whole, as the <hi>apoſtle</hi> moſt juſtly obſerves, <hi>It had been better for them not to have known the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, than</hi> thus, <hi>after they have known it, to turn aſide from the holy commandment</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">2 Pet. ii. 21.</note>.</p>
            <p>THIS may be in a great meaſure owing to the mutability of human nature in general, and particularly to the levity and inconſtancy of youth, in conjunction with the force of thoſe temptations of life, which continually ſurround and preſs upon them. Yet I apprehend this is not all, but that it is, in part, to be charged on ſomething defective, even in their beſt days, on their reſting in ſomething ſhort of real religion, and a true ſaving change. Solomon had ſeen reaſon to ſay, <hi>There is a way that ſeemeth right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death</hi> 
               <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Prov. xiv. 12.</note>: and I believe every conſiderate perſon will be ready to own, that in order to prevent ſo fatal a deluſion, and all the train of miſchiefs which may follow upon it, great care ſhould be taken in ſtating this important queſtion;
<q>What is the true and ſolid <hi>baſis,</hi> on which we may ſecurely ground our eternal hopes?</q>
It is a queſtion of the higheſt importance, and the moſt univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal concern, both to the <hi>aged</hi> and the <hi>young</hi>; ſo that I truſt I need not offer any apology for
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024272_0004_0FC5F7EE54E4F408"/>
complying with the requeſt of a pious and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious friend, who recommended this ſubject to our conſideration, at this time, and on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>IN proſecution of this deſign, I have made choice of theſe words of the <hi>apoſtle,</hi> which I have now been reading, and which may, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any violence to them, be very fairly and naturally accommodated to the preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p>IT is plain from many paſſages in this epiſtle, that the great apoſtle, who had planted the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church among the Galatians, had reaſon to fear, that many, who were by profeſſion its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, were not ſufficiently eſtabliſhed in their holy faith. It is probable; that he himſelf had an opportunity of making but a ſhort ſtay amongſt them; and, partly through their own negligence and prejudices, and partly through the artful attempts of falſe teachers, in the abſence of St. Paul, they appear to have fallen into a ſet of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a conduct, which tended not only to impair the glory, but to ſubvert the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the <hi>goſpel,</hi> and with it the foundation of their own eternal hopes. Of this the apoſtle does, in a very awful manner, admoniſh them. He tells them, in the very beginning of his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that <hi>he marvelled, that they were ſo ſoon remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him that called them</hi> (and from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples he had taught them) <hi>into another goſpel</hi> 
               <note n="(e)" place="bottom">Gal. i. 6.</note>. And afterwards he uſeth theſe very free and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical words: <hi>O fooliſh Galatians, who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched,</hi> or enchanted <hi>you, that you ſhould not obey the truth? Are you ſo fooliſh? Having begun in the ſpirit</hi> (having profeſſed to embrace the goſpel, and ſhewn the appearances of ſome common zeal
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024272_0005_0FC5F7EFA4D8EC20"/>
for it) can <hi>you now</hi> hope to be <hi>made perfect by the fleſh,</hi> or by the ritual and carnal obſervances of the Moſaic inſtitution? Is it thus that you diſgrace all you have done, and all you have borne for Chriſt? <hi>Have you</hi> then <hi>ſuffered ſo many things in vain</hi> 
               <note n="(f)" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 1—4.</note>? On the whole, he tells them, he was ready to apprehend, that all the agreeable hopes he had once entertained concerning them, would be buried in everlaſting diſappointment, and that it would appear, <hi>he had beſtowed upon them labour in vain</hi> 
               <note n="(g)" place="bottom">Chap. iv. 11.</note>. Thus did he <hi>ſtand in doubt of them</hi> 
               <note n="(h)" place="bottom">Chap. iv. 29.</note>; and that doubt pierced his heart with the moſt tender concern, and brought upon him, as it were a ſecond time, thoſe pangs of ſoul which he had felt on their account, when he ſaw them in all the ignorance and wickedneſs of their Gentile ſtate. He was hardly more ſolicitous then, that they might be <hi>turned from dumb idols to the living GOD,</hi> than he was now, that they might give convincing evidences that CHRIST was <hi>formed in them,</hi> i. e. that they had cordially received and digeſted the goſpel, and that their hearts were <hi>delivered into the mould of it</hi> 
               <note n="(i)" place="bottom">Rom vi. 17.</note>: which it did not appear they were, while they were thus making void the grace of GOD, and the righteouſneſs of faith, by adhering to the fooliſh and pernicious doctrine of the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſeeking their <hi>juſtification,</hi> in part at leaſt, by the obſervation of the Moſaic law.</p>
            <p>THIS ſeems to be the moſt natural ſenſe of the words of the text, where ſuch a latitude of expreſſion is uſed, as the apoſtle elſewhere ſeems to ſtudy, on purpoſe to render his writings uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally edifying, and uſeful to <hi>them,</hi> whoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024272_0006_0FC5F7F6C44CF3C0"/>
circumſtances in life are widely different from thoſe of the perſons to whom they were originally addreſſed.</p>
            <p>AS to the introductory words, <hi>My little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> we cannot imagine they refer to the <hi>age</hi> of thoſe to whom the apoſtle wrote. The evident deſign of them is, to expreſs that kind of parental tenderneſs which he entertained for them, like that which a mother hath for an infant with which ſhe travails in birth. <hi>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, till Chriſt be formed in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT would be eaſy to multiply obſervations from the words. I might eſpecially take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew,—that it is poſſible, thoſe that once ſeemed very hopeful, and ſtill maintain an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal profeſſion, may appear, after all, in ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous circumſtances, that judicious <hi>miniſters,</hi> and other <hi>Chriſtian friends,</hi> may be thrown into a great deal of perplexity and agony on their account;—and that the great thing neceſſary to eſtabliſh their ſafety, and the comfort of thoſe concerned for them, is, that the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt be formed in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT I may more particularly illuſtrate and improve the text, and take in what is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant in theſe remarks, I will
<list>
                  <item>I. CONSIDER ſeveral things, on which men are ready to build <hi>a falſe confidence,</hi> which will bring them into danger, and their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious friends into perplexity upon their account.</item>
                  <item>II. I WILL endeavour to ſhew you, what is the <hi>only ſolid foundation</hi> of their own hopes, and the joys of others with regard to them;
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024272_0007_0FC5F7FD1901AC20"/>
which is here expreſſed by <hi>Chriſt formed in them.</hi> And then,</item>
                  <item>III. I SHALL conclude with ſome more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>improvement,</hi> in proper inferences from the whole.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are plainly matters of <hi>univerſal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>; but as I am now peculiarly addreſſing myſelf to <hi>young perſons,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to fix on thoſe thoughts, which may be moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuitable to them: for I am much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned that my diſcourſe may be uſeful, than that it may be critically regular and exact. I hope there are many amongſt you, who are experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally acquainted with the vitals of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and have received from above an <hi>incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſeed</hi> 
               <note n="(k)" place="bottom">1 Pet. i. 23.</note>. There are others, to whom I muſt ſay with the apoſtle to theſe Galatians, <hi>I ſtand in doubt of you</hi> 
               <note n="(l)" place="bottom">Gal. iv. 20.</note>; and to ſuch, I hope, I can apply myſelf in the language of the text, <hi>My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, till Chriſt be formed in you.</hi> Pardon me, if in this inſtance <hi>I am jealous over you with a godly jealouſy,</hi> 
               <note n="(m)" place="bottom">2 Cor. xi. 2.</note>. I would endeavour, with the ſincereſt and tendereſt affection, and with ſuch freedom as the importance of the caſe requires, to guard you againſt thoſe <hi>ſandy foundations,</hi> which will bury you and your hopes deep in eternal ruins; and to direct you to <hi>the Rock of Ages,</hi> on which they who build ſhall <hi>never be aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I THEREFORE intreat your ſerious attention, and would humbly aſk, both for myſelf and you, the teachings of that bleſſed <hi>Spirit,</hi> whoſe pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar office it is, in the moſt efficacious manner, to ſhew us our danger and our remedy; to aid the labouring minds of <hi>miniſters,</hi> and to cauſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024272_0008_0FC5F801BB632FA0"/>

               <note n="(n)" place="bottom">Iſa. liii. 11.</note> while he gives to their hearers a new birth, and immortal life, by <hi>forming Chriſt</hi> in them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I AM to caution you againſt ſeveral things, on which <hi>young perſons</hi> are peculiarly prone to build <hi>a falſe</hi> and precarious <hi>confidence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND here let me particularly intreat you, as you love your ſouls, and value your eternal hopes,—that you <hi>truſt not</hi> to the privileges of your birth,—or the rectitude of your ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in matters of religion,—or the purity and frequency of your forms of worſhip,—or the warmth of your paſſions,—or the morality of your conduct: for none of theſe apart, nor even all of them united, can, according to the tenor of the goſpel, be ſufficient for your ſecurity and happineſs.</p>

            <p>SO various are the workings of men's hearts, and the devices of Satan, that, if I miſtake not, there are ſome that place their confidence in the <hi>ſtrictneſs,</hi> and others in the <hi>latitude</hi> of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious opinions; but the one, and the other, will appear <hi>equally vain,</hi> when conſidered in the view now before us.</p>
            <p>SOME may poſſibly perſuade themſelves, that their condition is ſecure, becauſe their <hi>ſentiments</hi> are <hi>orthodox.</hi> They live perhaps in the midſt of the unbelieving and profane, and ſee daily contempt and deriſion thrown upon the bleſſed goſpel, or its moſt glorious peculiarities; but through the influence of a good education, or from ſome other principle, ſhort of true piety, they may nevertheleſs not only <hi>hold faſt the faith once deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the ſaints,</hi> but even <hi>contend earneſtly for it,</hi>

As precious a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as the knowledge of the truth is, if we go no farther than mere ſpeculation, it will be to you

            <p>THERE are others who err in the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. <hi>Orthodox notions</hi> are <hi>their banter,</hi> rather than <hi>their confidence.</hi> They pride themſelves in having broke the ſhackles in which others are confined, and in ſeeing through the miſt in which multitudes have been perplexed. They are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that many things which divide the world are merely <hi>controverſies about words</hi>; and are not much concerned about others in which there is a real difference, becauſe they are well aware, that the <hi>fundamentals of religion</hi> lie in a very little room. They are confident of the innocency of error, and the ſafety of an <hi>honeſt mind</hi> under thoſe miſtakes which have been branded by the ſevereſt names. A wicked life is, in their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem, the only dangerous hereſy; and <hi>morality</hi> the only thing that is worth contending about. Charmed with their own wiſdom and happineſs in this freedom of thought, they look down with

               <note n="(w)" place="bottom">2 Pet. ii. 19.</note>. It is certain, that the moſt generous ſpeculations will no more ſave men of unregenerate hearts, and unholy lives, than the moſt rigid and ſevere ſet of notions. For <hi>notions</hi> and <hi>ſpeculations</hi> are in their nature ſo far ſhort of real goodneſs, that if there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than theſe, it matters but little what they are. Yet one cannot forbear obſerving a peculiar and moſt abſurd inconſiſtency in the conduct of thoſe, who think ſo highly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, becauſe they are poſſeſſed of this one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, that <hi>ſpeculation in general is a trifle, and morality is all</hi>; as if the whole of morality con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in bearing this teſtimony in its favour. I wiſh ſuch a character were not almoſt as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as it is for men to be bigots in defence of catholiciſm, and uncharitable in pleading the cauſe of charity.

            <p>I WILL conclude this head with obſerving, that the inſtance of the bleſſed apoſtle St. Paul ſerves well to illuſtrate and confirm our diſcourſe in each of the particulars I have now mentioned.

In theſe things, he was once ſo weak and ſo wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to place a great deal of confidence; but when he was illuminated, and called by divine grace, he aſſures us, that <hi>what things were gain unto him</hi> before, <hi>thoſe he counted loſs for Chriſt,</hi> i. e. he moſt entirely renounced all dependence upon them: <hi>yea doubtleſs,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus my Lord:</hi> which naturally leads me to the ſecond general, where</p>

acquainted with the temper and change which I ſhall now deſcribe, as ſignified by this remarkable expreſſion in the text, <hi>Chriſt formed in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW, I think, it implies theſe three things:— that ſome <hi>apprehenſions of Chriſt</hi> have taken hold of the heart;—that the man is brought to <hi>an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit choice of him,</hi> and deliberately enters into covenant with him;—and that in conſequence of both theſe, ſomething of <hi>the temper and ſpirit of Chriſt</hi> is by divine grace wrought in his ſoul. I will touch on each of theſe, but my time will not allow me to manage them in ſo copious and particular a manner as they well deſerve.</p>
            <p>1. TO have <hi>Chriſt formed in the ſoul</hi> ſuppoſes, that ſome <hi>ſerious apprehenſions of Chriſt</hi> have taken hold of the heart.</p>
            <p>IT evidently implies, that the external revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him hath not only been admitted as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative truth, but attended to as a matter of the higheſt concern. Previous to the <hi>forming of Chriſt</hi> in the ſoul, there muſt be a <hi>conviction,</hi> that we are naturally <hi>without Chriſt,</hi> and that, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, we are in a moſt unhappy condition. And <hi>this conviction</hi> muſt ſtrike deep upon the heart; for till the evil of ſin be felt, what can make the <hi>news of a Saviour</hi> welcome? Since, as he himſelf has declared, <hi>the whole need not a phyſician, but they that are ſick</hi> 
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Matt. ix. 12.</note>. The man in whoſe heart <hi>Chriſt is formed,</hi> has ſeen himſelf <hi>condemned</hi> by GOD's righteous law; has ſeen himſelf equally <hi>unable</hi> to anſwer its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or to bear up under the execution of its penalties. And feeling this to be <hi>no light matter,</hi> but the very <hi>life of his ſoul,</hi> he has then been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024272_0022_0FC5F8462B8EC1C0"/>
with the greateſt ſeriouſneſs and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to cry out, <hi>Woe is me, for I am undone</hi> 
               <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Iſa. vi. 5.</note>! Oh, <hi>what ſhall I do to be ſaved</hi> 
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 30.</note>? I before told you, there may be theſe <hi>convictions</hi> and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is never <hi>formed in the ſoul</hi>; and I now add, that the degree of them may be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, according to the various tempers and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of different perſons: but it is moſt evident that ſomething of this kind muſt make way for the Redeemer's entrance, who <hi>comes to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt</hi> 
               <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Luke xix. 10.</note>; <hi>to bind up the broken-hearted</hi>

               <note n="(f)" place="bottom">Mat. xi. 28, 29.</note>. And I the rather inſiſt on this, becauſe I am fully perſuaded, that ſlight thoughts of ſin, and of the miſery of our natural eſtate by it, have been the principal cauſe of all the infidelity of the preſent age, and are daily ruining a multitude of ſouls.</p>
            <p>2. THE formation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the ſoul doth farther imply <hi>an explicit choice of him,</hi> and a deliberate <hi>entering into covenant with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN ſuch a ſoul hears of a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and of the <hi>way of ſalvation</hi> by him, exhibited in ſcripture, it cordially <hi>approves</hi> the ſcheme, as entirely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of its divine author; and though corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture raiſes up a thouſand <hi>proud thoughts,</hi> in a vain and ungrateful rebellion againſt it, yet they are, by almighty grace, ſubdued and <hi>brought into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity</hi>

The man really ſees ſuch a ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſuch an amiableneſs, in the bleſſed Jeſus, under the character in which the goſpel reveals him, that he judges him to be <hi>the pearl of great price</hi>; and as GOD has laid him as <hi>the foundation-ſtone,</hi> he is, in that view, inconceivably <hi>precious to him</hi>

Far from contenting himſelf with applauding this plan, as regular, beautiful, and magnificent in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the true believer is ſolicitous, that he may have his own ſhare in this edifice of mercy; and that <hi>coming to Chriſt as a living ſtone,</hi> he may himſelf be one of thoſe, who ſhall <hi>on him be built up for an habitation of GOD through the Spirit</hi>

It is his deſire to ſeat him on the throne in his heart, and, as it were, to put into his hand the <hi>ſceptre</hi> and the <hi>ſword,</hi> that all the powers of nature may be governed, and all the corruptions of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by him. In a word, as he knows that Chriſt was <hi>given for a covenant to the people</hi> 
               <note n="(o)" place="bottom">Iſa. xlix. 8.</note> he deliberately <hi>ſets his ſeal</hi> to that <hi>covenant,</hi> thereby devoting himſelf to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and, through him, to the <hi>Father.</hi> Such are his views, his purpoſes, and his engagements; and by divine grace he is ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to be faithful to them. Which leads me to add,</p>
            <p>3. WHEN <hi>Chriſt</hi> is formed in any ſoul, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>temper and character of the bleſſed Jeſus</hi> is by divine grace <hi>wrought there.</hi>

            <p>3. WHAT <hi>need</hi> is there of the work of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Spirit</hi> on the heart, in order to the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>this great foundation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE language of the text, which ſpeaks of <hi>Chriſt formed in us,</hi> naturally leads our thoughts to ſome <hi>agent,</hi> by whom the work is done; and when you conſider what kind of a work it is, I appeal to your own conſciences, whether it is to be thought merely a <hi>human production.</hi> Were it only a name, a ceremony, a ſpeculation, or a paſſion, it would not be worth a moment's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, whether <hi>you</hi> or <hi>we</hi> ſhould have the glory of it. But as it is nothing leſs than the a <hi>transformation</hi> of a corrupt and degenerate creature, into the holy image of the Son of GOD, it were impiety for <hi>either</hi> to arrogate it to <hi>ourſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us therefore, on the whole, learn our duty and our wiſdom. Let the matter be brought to a ſerious and immediate review, and let us <hi>judge ourſelves</hi> by the character deſcribed, as thoſe that
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024272_0029_0FC5F860EDC3ED58"/>
expect very ſhortly to be <hi>judged of the Lord.</hi>—If, on the examination, any of you have reaſon to conclude that you are <hi>ſtrangers to it,</hi> remember that the invincible battery of the word of GOD demoliſhes all the towering hopes you may have raiſed on any <hi>other foundation.</hi> Let conſcience then ſay, whether any amuſement, or any buſineſs in life, be ſo <hi>important,</hi> as to be attended to, even for one ſingle day, in neglect of this <hi>great concern,</hi> on which all the happineſs of an immortal ſoul is ſuſpended. If nothing be indeed found of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er moment, apply yourſelves ſeriouſly to this, and omit no proper and rational methods of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it. Conſider the ways by which <hi>Chriſt</hi> uſes to enter into a ſoul, and wait upon him in thoſe ways. Reflect ſeriouſly on your preſent condition; conſtantly attend the inſtructions of his word, and the other ſolemnities of his worſhip; and chuſe to converſe intimately with thoſe, in whom you have reaſon to think <hi>he is already formed.</hi> But in all remember, that the ſucceſs depends upon a <hi>divine co-operation,</hi> and therefore go frequently into the preſence of GOD by <hi>prayer</hi>; go into it this day, or if poſſible this hour, and importunately intreat the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and ſanctifying influences of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> which, when you earneſtly deſire them, the <hi>goſpel</hi> gives you ſuch ample encouragement to expect. —But if you have reaſon to hope that you have <hi>already received them,</hi> learn to what the <hi>praiſe</hi> ſhould be aſcribed; and let it animate you to <hi>pray,</hi> that, through farther communications from the throne of grace, you may be made continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more <hi>like</hi> to your <hi>Redeemer,</hi> till you are prepared for that world, where you ſhall <hi>ſhine forth</hi> in his complete reſemblance, and ſhall find it your complete and eternal felicity. AMEN.</p>
