            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 KINGS, xii. 15.</bibl>
               <q>Wherefore the King hearkened not unto the people, for the cauſe was from the Lord, that he might perform his ſaying, which the Lord ſpake by Ahijah the Shilon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, unto Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>SOLOMON, altho' the wiſeſt of meer men, yet was guilty of much folly, that is, of ſin and wickedneſs, which is emphatically ſtiled folly in the ſacred ſcriptures. And eſpecially in the matter relating to his wives, concubines, and idolatry, was his ſin very provoking to the Lord; for we are told Solomon did evil in the ſight of the Lord, and the Lord was angry with Solomon. Hence we read that the Lord determined not to let his ſin go unpuniſhed. I Kings xi. 11, 12. <hi>Wherefore the Lord ſaid unto Solomon, for as much as this is done of thee, and thou haſt not kept my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and my ſtatutes which I commanded thee, I will ſurely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy ſervant: Notwithſtanding, in thy days I will not do it for David, thy father's ſake; but I will rend it out of the hand of thy ſon.</hi> Hence the prophet, by inſpiration, was ordered to give informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof to Jeroboam, to whom God determined to give the kingdom, when he ſhould take it from the ſon of Solomon. <hi>And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it into twelve pieces; and ſaid to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, take thee ten pieces: For thus ſaith the Lord, the God of Iſrael, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes unto thee.</hi> I Kings, xi. 30, 31. And now, that the purpoſe of God, and the prophecy of Ahijah might have their accompliſhment, we ſee what means the Lord made uſe of to bring the ſame about, viz. <hi>the corrupt tempers and wicked diſpoſitions of thoſe very perſons be determined to correct and puniſh.</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:013333_0003_0F9056C96747E498"/>
It was a puniſhment, and a ſevere correction to Rehoboam to have ten tribes taken from his kingdom: and it was a puniſhment, and a ſevere correction to the ten tribes alſo, to be rent off; and therefore it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed that God determined to rend them off, as a chaſtiſement for their wickedneſs, and eſpecially for their ſin of idolitry, <hi>Becauſe that they have forſaken me, ſaith the Lord, and worſhipped Aſhtaroth,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe who are led into ſin expoſe themſelves to puniſhment, as well as thoſe who lead; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' leaders expoſe themſelves, and merit puniſhment to a more aggravated degree. Altho' Solomon led the people to idolatry, yet idolators deſerve puniſhment, by what means ſoever they became ſuch.</p>
            <p>And as before hinted, God made uſe of the corrupt tempers and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſpoſitions of thoſe he determined to puniſh, to be the very means to bring it about; when Rehoboam was to be made king, the people, with Jeroboam, made a very abrupt demand, and it ſeems, by the manner of their doing of it, they did not care much whether he anſwered it or no: for it ſeems they had about determined what to do before hand, and ſo made their demand in ſuch a manner, all things conſidered, that it was not very likely to be granted, but rather likely to iritate the ſpirits of an ambitious and aſpiring prince. The demand of the people, in their addreſs to Rehoboam was, <hi>Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make the grievous ſervice of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter, and we will ſerve thee.</hi> v. 4 of our context; which ſeems evidently to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry an imply, If you don't, we will revolt. Upon this Rehoboam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults with the old men, what anſwer he had beſt to return the people; and they gave him wiſe and good counſel in ſtate-policy, which, if he had took, and had been condeſcending, and gave the people good words that day, as they adviſed him, he might have eſtabliſhed the kingdom to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and himſelf have been eſtabliſhed king over the ten tribes. But Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam was very unwiſe, or wiſdom was very much hid from the wiſe through the prevalency of the corrupt tempers of hisproud and ambitious heart. Therefore he conſults with the young men, brought up with him, and vain like himſelf, and he follows their advice, by anſwering the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple roughly, ſaying, <hi>My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke; my fathey alſo chaſtiſed you with whips, but I will chaſtiſe you with Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> v. 14. Here we ſee, the people demanded peremptorily, the prince anſwered tyrannically, which was the means of their own puniſhment, mutually. O! the tremendous wiſdom and juſtice of God in his conduct toward obſtinate ſinners! He can make ſin its own puniſhment, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners their own executioners and tormenters!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:013333_0003_0F905C96747E498"/>
Our text informs us, <hi>That the King hearkened not to the people; for the cauſe was from the Lord that be might perform his ſaying, which the Lord ſpake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jereboam the ſon of Nebat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe words we may note ſeveral things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A purpoſe or determination in God, to puniſh ſuch ſins in ſuch a manner, but not a new purpoſe none ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That God had revealed his purpoſe and intention by the mouth of the prophet Ahijah.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That God does, and will overule things ſo as that his purpoſes ſhall be brought about. <hi>The king hearkened not to the people, for the cauſe was from the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That God in his holy providence makes uſe of the corruptions and wickedneſs of men to bring about his righteous purpoſe and decree, and their own puniſhment when ever he pleaſes. For this we are not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be a ſingular caſe peculiar to Rehoboam and the ten tribes, for God to make uſe of their own corrupt tempers, and wicked diſpoſitions, as the means to bring about his purpoſe, and their puniſhment, but is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe in other inſtances, as we may ſee further confirmed in the ſequel. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I collect and lay down this doctrine, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord may, and often does, bring about his wife, holy and righteous purpoſe or decree, concerning particular events, by making uſe of the corrupt tempers, and wicked diſpoſitions of mankind, in order thereunto; and often improves their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent corruptions, as the means to puniſh them for former wickedneſs.</hi> To illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate this doctrine, I ſhall conſider the following propoſitions, viz.</p>
            <p>I. That God has a wiſe, holy and righteous purpoſe or decree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all events that ever take place,</p>
            <p>II. That in the courſe of providence God often brings about his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or decree, concerning particular events, by uſing and improving the wicked tempers, and corrupt diſpoſitions of mankind.</p>
            <p>III. That God may, and often does, improve the preſent corruptions of ſinners, as the means to chaſtiſe and puniſh them for former wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>I. That God has a wife, holy and righteous purpoſe or decree, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all events that ever take place. Here I ſhall conſider two things, (I) That God has a purpoſe or decree concerning all events that ever take place. (2) That 'tis a wife, holy and righteous purpoſe or decree.</p>
            <p>(I) That God has a purpoſe or decree concerning all events that ever take place. It may be called an eternal purpoſe or decree, as God has no new purpoſes nor new intentions upon any revolutions or alterations that take place in any part of the created cyſtem; which, to ſuppoſe he
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013333_0004_0F9056CA194329C0"/>
has, would argue mutability and change. And it may be called a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or decree, in the ſingular number, in reference to the act of God which is one, all one inſtantaneous act, and not a number of acts in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion one after another, as acts and purpoſes take place in finite minds; and yet we may call them purpoſes and decrees, in the plural number, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to events which are manifold, and the purpoſe and decree of God reacheth them all, that no one event cometh to paſs by meer caſualty and accident, reſpecting the Divine Being, or unconnected with the plan of events ſettled in the fore-ordination and appointment of God.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible that I am fallen upon a point that grates hard on the minds of many: To aſſert, <hi>that God, for his own glory, hath fore-ordained whatſoever comes to paſs,</hi> is looked upon to be a very frightful doctrine, and thought by many to be ſufficiently confuted, by only ſaying, <q>that if it be ſo, then God is the author of ſin, and man is not to blame if he does ſin.</q> But if this declaration in our catechiſm is duly attended to right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood and explain'd, it will appear to be agreable, both to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and reaſon, and that there is nothing more frightful in it than the truth, nor does the aſſertion make God the author of ſin, nor man a whit the leſs to blame for ſin, than if there was no decree about it.</p>
            <p>Some who deny the doctrine of the divine decrees, will ſay, <q>that God from all eternity fore-knew all events, as certain, which ever take place, altho' he did not fix their certainty by any decree of his.</q> To this it may be replied, that the fore-knowledge of any future event, as certain, always and neceſſarily implies that the ſame event is certain; becauſe in the nature of things, no degree of wiſdom, whether finite or infinite, can poſſibly know an event to be certain which is not ſo. And if God did from all eternity fore-know all events as certain that ever do take place, he muſt know upon what foundation they became certain; and if their certainty were not founded in and by his own decree, then it muſt be ſomething elſe that eſtabliſhed the certainty of events, and God, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſe ſpectator, looking on that which he had no hand in, ſaw the certainty of future events in that which fixed their certainty, and ſo fore-know all events, and yet not decree them. But I would fain query, what the <hi>something elſe</hi> was, which from all eternity, fixed and eſtabliſhed the certainty of all future events, diſtinct from the decree of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Was it fate? Was it any neceſſity in nature? Or was it the decree of ſome other Deity? Or won't it neceſſarily involve a man in blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the true God, to aſſert any poſitive cauſe, eſtabliſhing the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all events which from all eternity God ſaw the certainty of, and at the ſame time exclude the decree of God out of the queſtion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:013333_0004_0F9056CA194329C0"/>
But that the doctrine of the divine decrees, aſſerting that God, for his own glory, hath fore-ordained whatſoever comes to paſs, is no way abſurd, if rightly underſtood, and truly explained, I ſhall here juſt offer a word reſpecting two different kinds of events, and remark how we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that they are made certain by the decree of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt ſort of events I ſhall conſider, is ſuch as require the divine efficiency to produce them, viz. the creation of the world, the creation of man at firſt, or his new creation in Chriſt; the implantation of a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of holineſs in man, after he had loſt it, and the like. Now, if we ſhould ſay, that God from all eternity, fore-knew exactly at what period theſe events would take place; 'tis eaſy to ſee in this caſe, he could not fore-know the events, nor the time preciſely when they would take place, but only in his own eternal and immutable purpoſe, to exert his own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on ſuch wiſe as would infallibly produce thoſe effects; and that in ſuch a period one, and in ſuch a period another, and herein abſolutely fore-knew the certainty of the event. For theſe events could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly take place but only by the exertion of the divine power to produce them, and therefore could not be known to be cettain, but in knowing the purpoſe or decree of God, that in reality he was determined to exert his power ſo as without fail to bring the event to paſs. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other ſort of events I ſhall mention, is ſuch as are not produced by the divine efficiency, viz. <hi>the ſin of the creature.</hi> 'Tis a blaſphemous doctrine that ſome have run into to aſſert that God created ſin, and is the efficient cauſe of it, as he is of holineſs. God is the efficient cauſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, becauſe 'tis his own nature, and produced, whenever it is found in any creature, by his own power; but ſin is the reverſe. For ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, The ſun is the natural, poſitive and proper cauſe of light and heat, but not ſo of darkneſs and the cold; altho' in point of event darkneſs and cold do neceſſarily take place upon the ſun's withdrawing. And if the ſun in his daily and nightly revolutions, was a free and moral agent, and had no other being to controul it, we might ſay, he bounded, fixed, and limitted the hours of darkneſs, as well as the hours of light, altho' he was not the proper cauſe of darkneſs as he is of the light. So, God don't ſuffer the darkneſs of ſin to take place at random, but bounds and limits it by his decree; ſo as the proud waves of the ſea, ſaying hitherto ſhalt thou come and no further.</p>
            <p>But that we may ſee how the event is made certain, by the purpoſe, or decree of God, reſpecting ſin, we muſt conſider, not only that God don't exert any poſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tive efficacy of his, to produce it: but alſo, we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013333_0005_0F9056CAD98B9CA0"/>
that the decree of God lays no violence upon the freedom of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>but 'tis a determination in God, to ſuffer or permit the creature to chuſe, and act freely, in that which is ſin, and not interpoſe by his own power ſo as to prevent it; in ſuch circumſtances as he ſees the event will certainly take place if he don't.</hi> As for inſtance. God, by his infinite underſtanding and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, could not but know, that if he made man, Adam, and placed him juſt as he did, in that ſtate of trial, Adam would certainly ſin, in point of event, if God did not interpoſe by his divine power and grace, effectually to prevent it; and God determining (for wiſe ends) that he would not by his power prevent it, the event became fixed and certain in the divine mind, but the certainty of the event, had no manner of influence upon the mind of the creature in the affair, any more than if the event was not fixed and certain, for man acted juſt the freedom of his own mind, and juſt as he would do, in the ſame circumſtances, had there been no decree about it, unleſs God ſhould have done otherwiſe than he has, viz. prevented ſin where he has not ſeen fit to prevent it. And ſo we may ſay concerning the ſins of other men, as well as the ſin of Adam, that God perfectly knew, from all eternity, that men under ſuch and ſuch temptations as they would in time be under, would certainly ſin, ſo and ſo, juſt as they do, unleſs he ſhould effectually interpoſe by his power and grace, and prevent it. But for ſome wiſe and glorious ends, God determined he would not effectually prevent ſin, where in reality he now doth not; and ſo the event became fixed and certain, by the decree of God to permit, or ſuffer it to take place. And with the abſolute certainty, that thoſe events which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to ſin would take place, as well as other events, the divine plan ſtands connected; which we may ſee in an inſtance or two I ſhall mention as a ſpecimen, viz. Upon the invariable certainty that Adam would ſin, ſtands inſeperably connected, the ſcheme of redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, laid in God's eternal counſel of love and peace. Upon the invariable certainty, that Judas, the Jews and the Romans, would be wicked enough, with God's decree of permiſſion, to put Chriſt to death, ſtands inſeperably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected God's eternal purpoſe of ſalvation to ſinners by Chriſt's death. So, that when the event took place, and they by their wickedneſs had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually put Chriſt to death, the counſel of God was not fruſtrated, but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, as faith the apoſtle, Acts, ii. 23. <hi>Him, being delivered, by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate counſel, and fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> So, upon the invariable certainty that Pharoah would be hardened, and wicked as he was, and injure and oppreſs Iſrael as he did, God told Abraham of it, and the event connected with it, more than
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013333_0005_0F9056CAD98B9CA0"/>
four hundred years before hand. Gen. xv. 13, 14. But not to enlarge, the ſcripture is expreſs, <hi>that God worketh all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi> Eph. i. 11. And that ſinful actions, as well as others, are included, ſee Acts iv. 27, 28. <hi>Againſt thy holy child Jeſus, whom thou haſt anointed, both Herod and Pontious Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Iſrael were gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, for to do whatſoever thy hand and thy counſel determined before to be done.</hi> And although there are many devices in the heart of man, yet we are expreſly told, <hi>the counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I am to conſider that the purpoſe or decree of God, eſtabliſhing the certainty of all events that ever take place, is wiſe, holy and righteous. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This might be argued from the infinite perfections of God: The infinite perfections will not admit of any purpoſe in the divine mind, but what is wiſe, holy and righteous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This might be largely and fully proved, from the ſcripture; or the the ſcripture character we have of God, given in his holy word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But what I aim for the preſent to conſider and offer as proof, is <hi>the divine conduct.</hi> God executes his decrees, and I may ſay, explains them, in his Conduct. Many there are, who think it gives a ſhocking charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Divine Being, to ſay he hate decreed all events, or to ſay that God hath fore-ordained whatſoever comes to paſs. And yet theſe very men think they highly approve the divine conduct; or at leaſt they dare not object a word againſt it, but will ſpeak much in favour of it. But if the divine conduct is good, wiſe, holy and righteous, then an eternal purpoſe or decree in God, to do juſt ſo, muſt be good, wiſe, holy and righteous alſo. By way of ſimilitude, for illuſtration. Suppoſe a man has a ſecret purpoſe in his heart, which is bad, even to abuſe and injure his fellow men; when that purpoſe comes to be acted out, the conduct will appear to be very bad alſo; and rather more glaringly bad, in the conduct than in the purpoſe only. But yet, depraved mortals have often another way of arguing reſpecting the Divine Being. They will allow the divine conduct to be good, but an eternal purpoſe or decree in God to do juſt ſo, they hold to be ſhockingly bad. Hence, nothing ſeems to ſet ſome people in a greater ruffle than to mention the doctrine of election, fore-ordination or decrees; and hence they will fly therefrom as Moſes fled from his rod when it appear'd like a ſerpent, but when he took it in his hand, it became a ſtaff. So I ſay, if theſe men would but venture to come near theſe doctrines, with humble enquiry, and take hold of them with a good underſtanding of them, they would appear no more frightful, but as a ſtaff of comfort and ſupport in the hand of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:013333_0006_0F9056CC323921C8"/>
But that I may improve the divine conduct to illuſtrate and vindicate the doctrine of the divine decrees, let us conſider the divine conduct in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſuch events which depraved mortals ſeem moſt averſe to a willingneſs to own, are made certain, fixed, and bounded by a decree, viz. ſuch as the fall of Adam, or the ſin of his children, the final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency of any, and their eternal damnation. And on the other hand, that a decree from eternity ſhould engage, that a certain number of the fallen race, choſen by grace, ſhould, by the goſpel, be effectually and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly called; in time, receive the bleſſing of regenerating grace, and have ſalvation therewith inſeparably connected. I ſay, let us briefly, at this time, but truly and faithfully attend to the ſcripture account of what the divine conduct is, reſpecting theſe points.</p>
            <p>And we find by the ſcripture repreſentation of the divine conduct, that in fact God did make and place man, Adam, in a ſtate of trial—did ſuffer the temptations to prevail—did ſuffer Adam to ſin, when he knew he would ſin if he ſuffered it; and that God does ſuffer Adam's children to ſin is manifeſtly evident; and altho' he reſtrains them often, and prevents them from acting out all their heart wickedneſs, which otherwiſe they would, yet we ſee much is permitted to take place in the world. And under the light of the goſpel God does ſuffer many to continue in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency and unbelief to the laſt, and die under the curſe, and puniſhes them with eternal damnation, as they deſerve. And on the other hand, we find by ſcripture repreſentation, that 'tis fact that God does bleſs the means of grace to ſome, for their ſaving good—makes the goſpel the power of God unto their ſalvation—makes them willing in the day of his power—does extend to them regenerating grace—does beſtow the gift of faith, and thereunto inſeperably connects eternal life, and in the final end infallibly beſtows it upon them. Now, if the divine conduct in theſe things is good and glorious, and muſt be acknowledged by all, to be wiſe, holy and righteous, how is it poſſible that an eternal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or decree in the divine mind, to conduct juſt ſo toward his creatures, ſhould be otherwiſe than good and glorious, and ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, to be wiſe, holy and righteous. But the divine conduct in theſe things is repreſented in the ſcripture to be good and glorious, wiſe, holy and righteous; and for which God ought to be adored and praiſed to all eternity, even in his conduct both toward them who are ſaved, and them that periſh. Concerning the ſaved, their language in ſcripture is, <hi>Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory. By grace we are ſaved. Not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013333_0006_0F9056CC323921C8"/>
hath ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt. Not that we loved God, but he loved us. And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying thou art worthy to take the book, and open the ſeals thereof; for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood—ſaying, bleſſing and honor, and glory and power be unto him that ſiteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever.</hi> And concerning them that periſh, the ſcripture language is, <hi>What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and make his power known, endured with all long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the veſſels of wrath, fitted to deſtruction. The Judge of all the earth will do right. 'Tis a righteous thing with God, to recompence tribulation to them even when he ſhall ſay, depart, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire. Thou art righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, O Lord, becauſe thou judgeſt thus. Amen, Alleluia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus the eternal purpoſe or decree of God may be vindicated by the divine conduct, which is the decree acted out; and ſeeing the conduct is holy and righteous, which reſpects every event, the decree cannot be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>But before I diſmiſs this head, I will juſt anſwer one objection which is often brought againſt the doctrine of an eternal decree fixing the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all events. They ſay, "this renders the uſe of means wholly needleſs." But this objection is full as ſtrong againſt the doctrine of God's eternal fore-knowledge of all events as certain, as 'tis againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God; for God's eternal fore-knowledge of the certainty of all events, ſuppoſes that the events will come to paſs juſt ſo, and according as they are known to be certain. And they might ſay as well, this renders means uſeleſs. But the objection has its foundation in ignorance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention; and if men were won't to talk ſo, in worldly affairs, they would be looked upon not much ſhort of ideots. Let us ſee this in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar repreſentation by way of ſimilitude. Suppoſe a very rich and able man has a full purpoſe and determination to erect a magnificent building, and to finiſh it off to the turning of a key in the ſpace of a year; and he has carpenters, maſons and joiners, a competent number, and other work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men under his controul, ſufficient to perform the buſineſs; and he has an idea of the building finiſhed in his mind before hand, and rejoices in proſpect as tho' already accompliſhed; and on the ſuppoſition 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the man won't be diſappointed. Now, for one of that man's neighbours to tell him, Friend, you may diſmiſs all your workmen, and ſend them about their own buſineſs, for you need not employ one of them in going forward with your building, for the uſe of means is needleſs, and it will do no good to uſe them, for you have got a firm and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled purpoſe to finiſh your building by ſuch a time, and I am perſuaded
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013333_0007_0F9056CC65578260"/>
you are able to do it, and will not be diſappointed, therefore you had as good diſmiſs all your workmen as not. Now, for a man in this caſe to talk thus, would be to make himſelf ridiculous; for every one knows that the more firm a man is reſolved to finiſh a building in a certain ſpace time, and the more certain 'tis the man won't be diſappointed, the greater neceſſity there is to uſe the means by which 'tis to be brought about. And indeed, 'tis the man that is not determined to build, that may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs his workmen, and uſe no means in order thereto, and not the other. And full as abſurd it is, to talk as many do, that if all things are decreed which ever take place, then there is no neceſſity of uſing means, we had as good fling by all duties, as reading, preaching and praying, &amp;c. as not, for, ſay they, it won't alter the caſe at all, nor do any good. Whereas to talk ſo, 'tis a ſelf-contradiction: for on the doctrine, that all events are decreed, ſuppoſes the uſe of means, is one event, that is to take place, and that to be the means of another; and therefore on this plan, means are made as neceſſary, as on any other, and more ſo; <hi>means</hi> and <hi>end</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected together. As for inſtance. If God has ordain'd, that faith ſhall come by hearing, and ſalvation by faith, is it not neceſſary that we both hear, and believe too, in order to maintain a ſcriptural hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? But,</p>
            <p>II. I proceed to conſider the ſecond general head or propoſition, viz. That in the courſe of providence God often brings about his purpoſe or decree concerning particular events, by uſing and improving the wicked tempers, and corrupt diſpoſitions of mankind in order thereto. I ſhall mention a few ſcripture inſtances of this nature, briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The affair which our text and context relates unto, may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as one inſtance, as noted before. God determined to rend the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Rehoboam, that is, the ten tribes; this is the event to take place. But how does God bring it about? why, we ſee, that in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of providence, God made uſe of their wicked diſpoſitions; there was no condeſcention on the ſide of the prince, nor any ſubmiſſion on the ſide of the people, but contrary diſpoſitions prevailed, by which means the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction was fulfilled.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another inſtance I ſhall mention is concerning Joſeph: God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that Joſeph, one of the ſons or Jacob, ſhould be advanced to great honor and dignity in Egypt, and be the bleſſed inſtrument of laying up corn in ſtore againſt the grievous famine. But Joſeph was young, liv'd at a diſtance, and had no thoughts of ſo much as going to Egypt, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. But the ſcripture tells us that God ſent him there, and what means
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013333_0007_0F9056CC65578260"/>
he made uſe of in order thereunto, viz. the wicked tempers and evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Joſeph's brethren: <hi>They hated him,</hi> and ſold him, and did barbarouſly by their brother; <hi>they meant it for evil, but God meant it for good.</hi> God made uſe of their wickedneſs to be the means bring about his own holy purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When a nation and people have grown ripe for judgments, and the purpoſe and determination of God, is to puniſh them ſeverely, with the heavy calamity of war, captivity, bondage and ſlavery, then God is wont to make uſe of the corrupt diſpoſitions of ſome proud, and aſpiring mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>march, as Nebuchadnezzer of old, and many others we read of in the bible, to be the inſtrument, or rod, in the hand of God, to ſcourge a wicked and rebellious nation or people: and altho' ſuch an one, in one ſenſe, does the will of God, that is, chaſtiſes and ſcourges a wicked people, an event that God determined, yet, <hi>howbeit they meant not ſo, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did their heart think ſo.</hi> But it was in their heart to gratify their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, avarice and revenge. And therefore, when God has uſed ſuch rods ſufficiently to anſwer his purpoſe, he has been wont to break them to pieces, or burn them. See how this is repreſented in Iſaiah x Once more,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The merciful purpoſe and decree of God was to give his ſon to die for ſinners, that by his death, they might have life. But what means did God make uſe of to bring this aſtoniſhing event to paſs? Why, the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſpoſitions of mankind, excited by Satan, as Judas's covetouſneſs, the heart-malice and enmity of the high prieſts, &amp;c. But I need not enlarge, nor multiply inſtances, the point being plain. Well may we ſay, the Lord is wonderful in counſel, and mighty in working! whenever any have behaved themſelves proudly againſt him, he hath evidently been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them; when any rebelliouſly refuſe to obey his preceptive will, he can make them fulfil his decreetive will, whether they will or no; he can, and will ſerve himſelf, of them that won't ſerve him.</p>
            <p>III. The third thing to be conſidered is, The Lord may, and often does improve the preſent corruptions of ſinners, as the means to chaſtiſe and puniſh them for former wickedneſs. This is an awful and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous way of being puniſhed, yet the righteous Lord often puniſhes ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on this wiſe. We read in the firſt ch. Rom. that God puniſhed the Gentile idolators in this manner. That, <hi>when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, but changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image like to corruptible man. Wherefore God alſo gave them up to uncleanneſs, thro' the luſts of their own hearts to diſhonor their own bodies between themſelves.</hi> And
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013333_0008_0F9056CD22B832E8"/>
Further, <hi>Becauſe they chang'd the truth of God into a lie, and worſhipped and ſerved the creature more than the Creator. For this cauſe God gave them up to vile affections,</hi> which led them into abominable, and even unnatural actions. And again, <hi>As they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do thoſe things which are not convenient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And after the ſame manner we are told that God puniſhed the wicked Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, Pſalm lxxxi. 11, 12. <hi>My people would not be hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own heart's luſts, and they walked in their own counſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So God made uſe of the wicked &amp; corrupt diſpoſition of Pharaoh, to be the means of his puniſhment for his former wickedneſs, and even to be the means of his deſtruction. By his former wickedneſs he had forfeited di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine reſtraints, and God was pleaſed to with-hold reſtraining grace from him, and let his own luſts prove his own ruin. Hence his own wicked heart led him into the ſea, and ſo was the means of his deſtruction. So God made uſe of Haman's corruption, as the means of his deſtruction. For his proud, ambitious and aſpiring mind, was the means that brought him to his end, on a high gallows, as recorded in the book of Eſther.</p>
            <p>Again, in the inſtance of Judas: by his great wickedneſs, he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the grace of God, even reſtraining grace; and God determining to puniſh him in great ſeverity, with-holds reſtraining grace from him, and leaves him to fall a prey to his preſent wicked diſpoſition, as a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his former wickedneſs. And his unbelief hurries him to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and his deſperation to the haltar. And even concerning the damned in hell, we may ſuppoſe this to be the caſe with them, that God makes their preſent wickedneſs the means to puniſh them for their former wickedneſs, that is, their own luſts of pride and envy, their diſpair ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God, and implacable enmity againſt him are their continual tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p>USE I. If, as we have heard, God brings about his holy and wiſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or decree concerning many particular events, by uſing and improving the wicked diſpoſitions of mankind in order thereto, and often improves the preſent corruptions of ſinners as the means to chaſtiſe and puniſh them for former wickedneſs, then we may hence learn what grounds we have to fear that God is now about to ſcourge and chaſtiſe, in awful ſeverity, our ſinful nation and land; and as a juſt puniſhment for former ſins, to make uſe of the preſent corruptions of men to be the means to bring about their own miſery? How ſimilar is the circumſtance of our nation and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013333_0008_0F9056CD22B832E8"/>
land now, to that of Jeroboam and the children of Iſrael, both with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ripeneſs for judgments by former ſins, and ripeneſs in preſent cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and wicked diſpoſitions diſcovered, to be the means to bring mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ruin upon our own heads, if heaven prevent not.</p>
               <p>When people, highly favoured of God, will ſin againſt his goodneſs, and merit his wrath, God may ſay in judgment, you may ſin, and bring your own ruin. This was the caſe of Solomon, Rehoboam, and the children of Iſrael: they ſinned much againſt the goodneſs and mercy of the Lord, and therefore it was but juſtice for the Lord to ſuffer them to ſin againſt themſelves, that is, to bring judgments upon themſelves by their ſins. So, by way of puniſhment, God ſuffered an unreaſonable and tyrannical ſpirit to prevail in Rehoboam, and a licentious and rebellious ſpirit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail among the ten tribes; by means of which, they were mutually chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, and a train of evils followed; for we are told, there was war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Rehoboam and Jeroboam, all the days of their life, and the evils did not end with their lives neither.</p>
               <p>So by way of puniſhment God is threatening of us now, &amp; if he ſhould ſuffer arbitrary and tyrannical edicts to iſſue from the higheſt ſeat of power in our nation, tending to abridge the colonies in America of their natural and conſtitutional liberties; and the people ſhould refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thereto, let the riſque be what it will; and if what is begun of this nature, and has already took place in a degree, ſhould be ſuffered to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, what can we expect but blood ſhed and ruin? yea, mutual ruin, the ruin of Britain as well as of the colonies? And if this ſhould be, if this awful event ſhould take place, we muſt, and we ought, to acknowledge the hand of God therein, and that the hand of God therein is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, however ſinful the inſtruments may be by which it is brought about.</p>
               <p>Our text tells us <hi>the King hearkened not to the people, for the cauſe was from the Lord.</hi> And if the king of Great-Britain will not hearken to the people in the colonies of America, if he will not hearken to their humble petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor to their particular demands, the cauſe is from the Lord; and doubtleſs for this cauſe, viz. becauſe he intends to puniſh the nation for national ſins; and to make uſe of the corruptions of thoſe he means to puniſh, as the means to bring it about. If a righteous God had not a hand in what this land ſeems to be threatened with, as well as unrighteous men, we ſhould have leſs cauſe to fear. If the great King of Heaven did not threaten to puniſh this land, we ſhould have leſs cauſe to fear the threats of the king of Great-Britain. And if there is no act paſſed in the court of heaven to puniſh us, we might hope, ſome how, to evade the acts
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013333_0009_0F9056CE0EE7DB60"/>
of parliament, paſſed with that deſign. But this, alas! this is what we have reaſon to fear, that God is now about to chaſtiſe, and in great ſeverity, to puniſh ſuch a wicked land and nation as our's is, at this day grown ſo ripe for ruin. When the wickedneſs of the old world was great upon the earth, God ſent the deluge and ſwept them off of the earth; and when the cry of Sodom, whoſe wickedneſs was great, went up to heaven; the Lord whoſe wrath was hot, rained down fire and brimſtone upon them, out of Heaven. And how can we expect to eſcape the ſevere judgments of God, when there is ſo much of the ſin of the old world &amp; of Sodom too, to be found in our nation and Land? Britain and America, eſpecially this part of America, called New-England, have been eminently favoured by heaven for a greatwhile, but have not made anſwerable returns, but have requited the Lord with evil for his goodneſs. <hi>And will not the Lord viſit for theſe things, and be avenged on ſuch a nation as this?</hi> O! what a deluge of impiety has overſpread Britain, at this day ſo much drench'd in all manner of debaucheries &amp; wickedneſs? How doth intemperance, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs and ſenſualities of all kinds prevail? What profanation the day and name of the Lord, and contempt of the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt? What licencious doctrines and damnable heriſies are imbibed, while the glorious truths of the goſpel are rejected? Doth not arminianiſm, arianiſm, deiſm and infidelities of the groſſeſt kinds prevail? While truth, and the power of godlineſs is but rarely known, in a comparative ſenſe I mean. There is doubtleſs a few at this day, and comparatively but a few, eminent ones, like Lot in Sodom, daily have their <hi>righteous ſouls vexed with the evil deeds and converſation of the wicked while they live among them.</hi> And if we caſt our eyes over the American land, and colonies, and even New-England in particular, once renowned for piety, and purity, and with the apoſtle ſhould aſk the queſtion, <hi>are we better than they?</hi> muſt we not with him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>no in no wiſe.</hi> Or if in ſome branches of impiety, this land has not yet quite equalled her mother country, yet how manifeſt it is, that as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we have been long on the march, and have travelled with the rapid ſwiftneſs, towards as high a pitch of wickedneſs as was ever practiſed in our mother country, or any other in the univerſe, And the ſame ſins in this lands, muſt be more henious in the ſight of God than in ſome other countries, by reaſon of our being more highly exalted in point of privileges, ſpiritual privileges eſpecially, with reſpect to the primitive religion of New England, the glory is departed, the gold is become dim, and the moſt fine gold changed. <hi>Do we thus requite the Lord, O fooliſh people and unwiſe</hi> Have we not now reaſon to expect the frowns of Heaven, &amp; a ſtorm of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013333_0009_0F9056CE0EE7DB60"/>
to be ſent down upon us? And are not the clouds now gathering? And have been for ſome time, both thick and dark? And what does this portend but a ſtorm at hand? People now in New-England begin to feel the effects of deſpotic power, and are alarm'd thereat, but yet entertain hopes to evade the force of it, but whether they can or no, heaven only knows. How vigilant have many been of late, to ſtudy, aſſert and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their natural and conſtitutional liberties and privileges? And what a loud and juſt cry they make againſt that power, or claim of power that would abridge them of the ſame? And yet among other ſins, is not New-England, the government and authrity of ſome of the colonies in New-England, guilty of exerciſing the ſame arbitrary power, to abridge man, or their natural and conſtitutional liberties and privileges? One of the natural rights of mankind is, a liberty to chooſe, in matters of religion, that way, mode, form and worſhip which a man in his conſcience thinks moſt is agreable to the word of God, and moſt acceptable to God. And the conſtitution of the goſpel confirms this natural right unto man, by bidding individuals <hi>ſearch the ſcriptures,</hi> &amp;c. And the deſign of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal conſtitution of New-England was the ſame. For our fore-fathers came into this land, to enjoy and grant liberty of conſcience. But now times and things amongſt us are ſo altered from their original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in New-England, that if a number in point of conſcience, reduce the principles of our fore-fathers in this land into practice, by adhering to the Cambridge platform, in forming a church, ordaining a miniſter, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, &amp;c. it has often ſo happened in New-England, in Connecticut in particular, that ſuch men muſt be oppreſſed by the laws of the colony, and their eſtates taken from them one ſeven years after another, to ſupport another worſhip than their own, a worſhip they have no connection with, but only by living in the bounds of civil ſociety. And petitions to the general aſſembly for relief, in this caſe, have been often repulſed; and when and where it has been ſo, how have particular towns and ſocieties been embolden'd, under the patronage of the legiſlators of the colony, to vote and take away the eſtates of their honeſt neighbours yearly, when they know in their conſcience 'tis not doing as they would be done by. But how righteous would it be in God to puniſh ſuch law-makers, and thoſe who are hardy enough to put the ſame into execution, by bringing them under arbitrary laws of the ſame nature? How juſt would the retalation be, if God ſhould pay them in their own coin? What if the king of England ſhould not only ſend laws and acts of parliament to the colonies to cut ſhort the liberties and freedom of the people here, which hitherto
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013333_0010_0F9056CF5E8ED0A0"/>
we have enjoyed? But what if he ſhould alſo ſend ſnipping, and force by ſea ſufficient to enforce them? eſpecially to enforce them on the capital towns and ſea-port places, or orders to deſtroy them? And whether the reſolutions already formed in parliament to ſubject the colonies to their edicts, won't make even this probable, eſpecially when the ſame comes to be iritated and increaſed by the news of the late conduct of the people of Boſton, deſtroying ſuch a quantity of Tea belonging to the Eaſt-India company, and deſtroying of it on the very principle of refuſing to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to parliamentary power, making laws to bind the colonies. Now, the thing is, whether the next queſtion in parliament won't be, <hi>Who ſhall ſubmit or yield, we, or the colonies?</hi> And whether it won't be natural for the parliament to think that they have gone too far already to drop the matter now, conſiſtent with their honor? And whether they won't alſo think that the colonies, Boſton in particular, have gone too far, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting their authority, to be ſuffered to go unpuniſhed? And therefore with reſolution will rally all their force, rather than not ſubject the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? And on the other hand, the colonies ſeeing the deſign of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment acts, to abridge their liberties, and fearing what is to come of that nature, will doubtleſs, as they have already begun, endervour to unite and ſtrengthen themſelves by union, to reſiſt, all they can, the force of thoſe arbitrary acts. But what if this encreaſing reſolution, and recollecting ſtrength on both ſides, ſhould be the very means of mutual ruin? God can eaſily make this uſe of it, and righteouſly, on this wiſe, ſcourge a wicked nation and ſinful land. However, we would gladly hope hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven won't ſuffer things to be carried to that extreme; but who can ſay there is no danger of it? And have we not reaſon to fear ſomething very calamitous of this nature will take place? And perhaps we ſhall ſoon ſee more diſtreſſing times in America, in New-England, than ever we ſaw in all our northern war, with the French and ſavage foe.</p>
               <p>But what ſhall the colonies do, or which way ſhall they turn for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? Why, ſome ſeem to think that 'tis eaſy anſwered: They ſay, only let the colonies unite, and agree firmly that they won't import any more goods from Britain, till theſe acts are repeal'd, and England will ſoon be obliged to yield. But I think the propoſed remedy a very precarious and uncertain. For there may be great difficulty in getting the colonies to unite; and doubtleſs there will be men of influence in every colony of ſuch a mercenary ſpirit, that if they view it probable that their own honor and intereſt will be advanced by taking the parliament ſide, and pleading in favour of their right and power in matters relating to the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013333_0010_0F9056CF5E8ED0A0"/>
preſent controverſy, they will very readily do it; for if, as we have ſeen by public accounts given, that a native of the metropolis of New-England, advanced to the higheſt ſeat of power in the government, viewing, as we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, his honor and intereſt connected with that ſide the queſtion, could not only be willing that there ſhould be ſome <hi>"abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what is called Engliſh liberties,"</hi> but even <hi>court</hi> the ſame; ſurely we can't have much dependance upon men, eſpecially men who are candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for poſts of honor and preferment. For the pſalmiſt's obſervation is often a verified truth; <hi>men of low degree are vanity; and men of high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are a lie;</hi> for they often deceive, as a lie doth, to the injury of thoſe who depend upon them. And beſides. Suppoſe the union of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſhould not be impeded, or abſolutely hindred, by men who would, ſacrifice the public good, to private intereſt, yet how do we know, but when the motion, and attempt for ſuch a thing, comes to be underſtood or Britain, I ſay how do we know, but this very thing will be the means to increaſe and haſten parliamentary rage and reſolution, to be the more ſpeedy and ſevere, in order to reduce, to their ſubjection, the capital towns, and the firſt, and chief leaders, in the factions and rebellions of America, as they call it; and even if it be too much bloodſhed, and the total ruin of valuable, and populous towns; and yet, flatter themſelves, that they are doing their duty in being vigorous in cruſhing rebellion in the bud, and by being ſpeedy, anſwer the end effectually, and ſhed as little blood as may be and leſs than muſt be if matters are delayed. But ſay ſome, our King won't be ſo unwiſe, as really to deſtroy his own ſubjects, and weaken his own kingdom, and thereby expoſe himſelf to his neighbouring enemies. To this it may be replied. Have we not often heard, and ſometimes ſeen, that wiſdom is ſometimes hid from the wiſe, and eſpecially, when the time is come, that God is determined to puniſh or deſtroy them. And I look upon it, that the preſent melancholy appearances of things, by which the colonies are threatened, the kingdom is alſo threatened with ruin. But the queſtion recurs again, what muſt be done? why, I am apt to think that it would be wiſe, and well, for all the colonies to unite, and every man in each colony, in all warrantable ſteps under the guidance of wiſdom and prudence, to maintain their threatened rights and liberties, and even for individuals, in ſuch a day as this, to be willing to ſacrifice much of their private intereſt for the ſake of the public good. But I leave it to others to plan, in thoſe affairs which relate to ſtate policy, and give my advice in another character. Therefore to the queſtion, in this diſtreſſing day, what muſt we do, what mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

I anſwer, The beſt way is to take the ſcripture advice, under threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgments. <hi>Break off thy ſins by righteouſneſs, and thine eniquities by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy to the poor, if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquility.</hi> We ſee the ſteps which Ninivah took, when threatened with immediate, deſtruction, and the happy effect that followed, God ſpared the city. Therefore let us all repent of our ſins, and unfeignedly turn to the Lord, that iniquity prove not our ruin. And this ſhall be our ſecond uſe.</p>
               <p>USE 2. of exhortation. There is a loud call upon us now, to make God our friend, and that we may thus do, it is neceſſary that we be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to him; that we caſt away our weapons of rebellion, and fall in humble ſubmiſſion at Gods feet, begging for that mercy we have forfeited, and that we may eſcape that wrath we have merited. And if our humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and repentance be ſincere—univerſal or general—accompanied with reformation of all known evils, we may hope that the Lord will yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for us and open ſome way for our eſcape even of thoſe temporal judgements with which this land is now threatened. And to excite one and all, now forthwith to ſee and feel the neceſſity of repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in order warrantably, to hope that God will deliver us from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending danger, I ſhall mention one or two things by way of motive.</p>
               <p>And, 1. According to God's decree and appointment of events, God has been wont to connect <hi>means</hi> and <hi>end</hi> together. That in a time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if people become ſenſible, humble, penitent and reformed, this is wont to be the means, by which the end is brought about, viz. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverence of that people from the threatened deſtruction, as in the caſe of Ninivah, &amp;c. So on the other hand, when a people are apparently threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with diſtruction, and they continue hardened, impenitent and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, this is the means, in God's plan eſtabliſhed, to bring about the end, viz. The deſtruction of that people.</p>
               <p>So now, if we deſire the end, viz. the deliverence of this land from the awful judgments with which we are threatened, then let us comply with; and be in the uſe of means requiſite, that is, let us repent of ſin and turn to God. See how this is repreſented in Jer. xviii. 7. 8. <hi>At what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to pull down, and to deſtroy it: If that nation againſt whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil I tho't to do unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in ſuch an inſtance as this we are not to ſuppoſe, that there was really any change or alteration in God, although he condeſends to ſpeak after the manner of men, as tho he repented and altered his purpoſe; for when men repent, they do change and alter their purpoſe; ſo when God
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013333_0011_0F9056D018911BB8"/>
altars his conduct towards a people, he ſpeaks to men as tho' he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But in reality the change was in the people, and not in God; and when there became ſuch a change in the people for the better, the end of the threatning was anſwered, and it became meet and ſuitable that God ſhould change his diſpenſations towards them; and this ſeems to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as though he repented, altho' <hi>he is not a man that he ſhould repent.</hi> But this conduct in God, in changing his diſpenſations towards people, as they change, either for the better or for the worſe, is entirely agreeable to God's immutable and eternal purpoſe and decree, becauſe therein he determined to do juſt ſo, connecting <hi>means</hi> and <hi>end</hi> together. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the way of eſcape is on this wiſe, now open to us, both by the decree connecting means and end, and the written word of God, propoſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as the means to eſcape either national or eternal deſtruction. And therefore we ought to ſee, and feel, the neceſſity of being in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the appointed means of ſafety. And mankind will be volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in that conduct which will be the means, either to avert or bring ruin. And God in his providence now, as well as in his word, is ſetting life and death before us, and is bidding us chooſe: and therefore, O, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, O, New-England, be wiſe, and chooſe life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond motive to urge all to repentance, and a genuine turning to the Lord, I ſhall make uſe of is, <hi>The real ſtraits we are already plunged in, by things that have operated and took place.</hi> Parliament acts have took place, that is, they exiſt, are enjoin'd; oppoſition and reſiſtance have took place; reſentment and reſolutions have took place; and what further will take place, who can tell? But let the colonies turn which way they will, are they not in an awful ſtrait? Suppoſe the colonies, for peace ſake, and to prevent the confuſion and diſtreſs that is likely to follow, if they ſhould continue to reſiſt parliament acts; I ſay, ſuppoſe they ſhould ſubmit, and comply with the claim of parliamentary power in paſſing acts to bind the colonies, and ſubmit to all they lay upon us, <hi>where will they ſtop?</hi> Who can tell that? Surely we know not. It may be, that their claims and their authority won't ſtop at temporal property; but when they have got the colonies all ſubjected, and faſt bound as to that, ſo that they can make but feeble or no reſiſtance at all, then perhaps our religious privileges and liberties will be call'd for next, and in lieu thereof Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enjoin'd. For I think that there is ſuch a kindred and likeneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a deſpotic power claim'd by mortals, arbitrary government, and Popery, that they who are friendly to the one, cannot be enemies to the other. But wo to the colonies, woe to New-England, if this ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013333_0012_0F9056D530AD6D00"/>
come to paſs! and who can ſay we are out of danger? Not only to have temporal property at the diſpoſal of arbitrary power, but conſcience bound by Popiſh chains, which, when thoroughly faſtened upon us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way muſt go our bibles, and in lieu thereof, we muſt have impoſed upon us, the ſuperſtitions and damnable hereſies and idolatries of the church of Rome. Then we muſt pray to the Virgin Mary, worſhip images, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the doctrine of Purgatory, and the Pope's infalibility, and ſuch like. And laſt of all, the deepeſt plot of hell and Rome, the holy inquiſition, muſt guard the Catholic faith of the church of Rome, and bind us thereto with all its terrors and cruelty. O! who that is awake, with any ſenſibility hereof, had not rather looſe their blood and lives too, than leave poſterity in ſuch an awful ſituation! No wonder then, that men of ſenſe and honor, no wonder that men of piety and religion, no wonder that men of conſcience and fidelity, are loth to ſubmit to that, which they have reaſon to think is leading towards this, and have reaſon to fear will terminate in this if ſubmitted to. While the enemies of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would fain have it go that 'tis only the faction of mob and rabble that has made any oppoſition, or that diſcovers any reluctance in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. And if on the other hand, the colonies do not yield; if they think they are bound in faithfulneſs to our native rights, and Engliſh liberties, in faithfulneſs to themſelves, and to unborn poſterity, to reſiſt that claim of power that would enſlave them; yet what a ſtrait are the colonies plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, for who can tell how far to carry their reſiſtance? If reſiſting by diſputing the point would do, a manly reſiſtance has already been made, by diſcovering and vindicating our natural and conſtitutional libertis; and by dint of argument have, on that wiſe, won the field, if we might be allow'd to poſſeſs the juſt victory obtain'd; but we find that won't do our turn. And now we hear, that at Boſton, further reſiſtance has been made, even to the deſtruction of property, which, certain it is, nothing but pure neceſſity can warrant.<note n="*" place="bottom">When I ſay nothing but pure neceſſity can warrant the deſtruction of property, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the deſtruction of the tea at Boſton, I mean not abſolutely to determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there was a real neceſſity for it or no; for not having a univerſal acquaintance with the affair, as to the grounds, reaſons or expediency, I muſt in ſome ſort ſuſpend my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the preſent; altho' perhaps they were too haſty and raſh, as it is natural to run into extremes, even in the defence of a juſt cauſe, But however it were in this caſe, I ſuppoſe the neceſſity may be ſuch as will warrant the deſtruction of property, and even of lives too, The Engliſh liberties are valuable and precious, and were not obtained but at the expence of much blood; and tamely to reſign them up, whenever arbitrarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, argues more baſeneſs than true loyalty of ſpirit.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And what ſhall the colonies do? Shall they reſiſt further yet? Shall
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013333_0012_0F9056D530AD6D00"/>
they reſiſt unto blood, or if they have ſo done already, ſhall they reſiſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſhedding of blood as well as the loſs of blood? Or, if it ſhould once come to blood-ſhed another time, what woful times muſt we expect?</p>
               <p>So, it appears, I think, evident enough, to all who are not ſtupidly blind, that the colonies now, are in a ſad and woful plunge let them turn which way they will, either ſubmit to or reſiſt theſe parliament acts; and what adds to the calamity is, the divided ſentiments among us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning what is right, and beſt for us to do, while ſome take one ſide the queſtion, and ſome the other.</p>
               <p>And ſurely we ſtand in need of help from the Lord, that he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his kind providence, and deliver us out of this ſtrait. When the children of Iſrael were brought into a ſtrait, and could ſee nothing but deſtruction, the ſea before them, the Egyptians behind them, and mountains on either ſide, and ſeem'd to be ſhut up unto ruin; yet in the mount and mouth of danger, the Lord appeared, and opened a way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and unthought of by them for their eſcape. And as we are now threatned with ruin, and according to the appearance of things, ſome aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgments are nigh. Therefore, let one and all turn to the Lord, and ſeek his mercy, <hi>before the decree bring forth,</hi> in our deſtruction, <hi>before the days paſs as the chaff, that we may be hid in the day of the Lord's anger;</hi> and imitate the Ninivites, when expoſed to deſtruction, who, from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the leaſt, humbled themſelves before the Lord in ſackloth and aſhes, and cried mightily to the Lord, upon this encouragement, <hi>Who can tell if the Lord will turn away his fierce wrath that we periſh not.</hi>
