            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN obedience to your deſire, I have ſent you the hiſtory of the yellow fever as it appeared <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the year 1748, which, as far as I can remember, agreed in its ſymptoms with the ſame diſeaſe, when it viſited this town in former years. In <hi>this</hi> hiſtory, I have confined myſelf to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful narration of facts, and have avoided any phyſical inquiry into the cauſes of the ſeveral ſymptoms in this diſeaſe; as that would have required more leiſure than I am, at preſent, maſter of, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been leſs uſeful than a plain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:035733_0003_10063D0FBB342C78"/>
I wrote this hiſtory, ſo far as it relates to the ſymptoms and prognoſtics, in the year 1748, when we had the diſeaſe laſt in this place; intending afterwards, if it return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to add, from further experience, the method of cure, and likewiſe an account of any other ſymptoms which might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it; but as no ſuch opportunity has offered, I muſt now omit that part. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I hope the deſcription which I have given of this dreadful malady, which ſo frequently rages like the plague in the ſouthern parts of America, is ſo full, that a phyſician may, from thence, not only form a true judgment of its nature, but likewiſe be able to deduce and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſome more certain method of cure, than has perhaps hitherto been uſed.</p>
            <p>I am ſorry I could not give a fuller account of the diſſections of thoſe who died of this diſeaſe, having unfortunately loſt my notes taken from thoſe diſſections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035733_0004_10065DE6D2504B20"/>I. THAT <hi>fever,</hi> which continues two or three days, and terminates without any critical diſcharge by ſweat, urine, ſtool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leaving the patient exceſſively weak, with a ſmall pulſe, eaſily depreſſible by very little motion, or by an erect poſture; and <hi>which</hi> is ſoon ſucceeded with an icteritious colour in the white of the eyes and the ſkin, vomiting, haemorrhages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe, without being accompanied with any degree of a febrile pulſe and heat, is called in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the <hi>yellow fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. THIS fever does not ſeem to take its origin from any particular conſtitution of the weather, independent of <hi>infectious miaſmata,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Warren</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In his Treatiſe concerning the malignant fever in Barbados</note> has formerly well obſerved.</p>
            <p>FOR within theſe twenty-five years, it has only been four times epidemical in this town, namely, in the autumns of the year 1732, 39, 45 and 48, though none of theſe years (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that of 1739, whoſe ſummer and autumn were remarkably rainy) were either
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035733_0005_10065DE9CB359548"/>warmer or more rainy (and ſome of them leſs ſo) than the ſummers and autumns were in ſeveral other years, in which we had not one inſtance of any one being ſeized with this fever; which is contrary to what would probably have happened, if particular conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the weather were productive of it, without infectious <hi>miaſmata.</hi> But that this is really an infectious diſeaſe, ſeems plain, not only from this, that almoſt all the nurſes catched it and died of it; but likewiſe, as ſoon as it appeared in town, it ſoon invaded new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comers, thoſe who never had the diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and country-people when they came to town, while thoſe who remained in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try eſcaped it, as likewiſe did thoſe who had formerly felt its <hi>dire</hi> effects, though they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the town, viſited the ſick in all the different <hi>ſtadia</hi> of the diſeaſe, and attended the funeral of thoſe who died of it. And laſtly, whenever the diſeaſe appeared here, it was eaſily traced to ſome perſon who had lately arrived from ſome of the Weſt-Indian Iſlands, where it was epidemical. Although the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was ſpread with great celerity through the town, yet if any from the country receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in town, and ſickened on their return
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035733_0006_10065DEB68D264C8"/>home, the infection ſpread no further, not even ſo much as to one in the ſame houſe.</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE ſubjects which were ſuſceptible of this fever, were both ſexes of the white colour, eſpecially ſtrangers lately arrived from cold climates, Indians, Miſtees, Mulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes of all ages, excepting young children and of thoſe only ſuch as had formerly eſcaped the infection. And indeed it is a great happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that our conſtitutions undergo ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the ſmall-pox, meaſles and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, as for ever afterwards ſecure us from a ſecond attack of thoſe diſeaſes. There is ſomething very ſingular in the conſtitution of the Negroes, which renders them no lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this fever; for though many of theſe were as much expoſed as the nurſes to the infection, yet I never knew one inſtance of this fever amongſt them, though they are equally ſubject with the white people to the <hi>bilious fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. THIS fever began in the middle or rather towards the end of Auguſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till near the middle of October, when the weather became cold enough to prevent
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035733_0007_10065DECF7C49C80"/>its further progreſs. In the beginning of Auguſt, the weather was warmer than I had ever known it in that month: the mercury in Farenheit's thermometer, for ſome days at 2 o'clock, <hi>p. m.</hi> roſe, in the ſhaded air, to the 96th degree, at which time ſeveral people died of apoplexies. The latter part of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and the firſt week in September were much more temperate; the weather being then much as uſual at that ſeaſon of the year. The ſecond week in September was cold, the wind being conſtantly eaſterly and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cloudy; after which time I kept a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of the heat of the ſhaded air; an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of which follows.</p>

            <p>IN all the month of September, and in the greateſt part of October, the wind was eaſterly.</p>
            <p>THE depth of the rain in Auguſt, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember and October reſpectively, was 6.881, 7.442 and 5.550 inches; which, though it exceeded the rain of theſe three months tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en together at a medium, from the ten pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding years, by 5.570 inches, yet it was inferior to that which fell in the ſame months in ſeveral other years; for in the years 1747, 50, 51 and 52, there fell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, in thoſe three months of theſe years, above 21, 22, 24 and 26 inches of rain.</p>
            <p n="5">V. FOR a day or two before the attack of the fever, people in general complained of a headach, pain in the loins and extremities, eſpecially in the knees and calves of the legs, loſs of appetite, debility and a ſpontaneous laſſitude.</p>

In ſome there was a remarkable throbbing in the carotids and in the <hi>hypochondria</hi>; in the latter of which it was ſometimes ſo great, that it cauſed a conſtant tremulous motion of the <hi>abdomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>heat,</hi> generally, did not exceed 102 degrees of Farenheit's thermometer; in ſome it was leſs, it varied frequently, and was commonly nearly equal in all parts, the heat about the <hi>praecordia</hi> being ſeldom more intenſe than in the extremities, when theſe were kept covered. In the firſt day of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035733_0010_10065DF4B7300958"/>diſeaſe, ſome had frequent returns of a ſenſe of chillneſs, though there was not any abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their heat. In a few, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſo great a remiſſion of the heat for ſome hours, when at the ſame time the pulſe was ſoft and leſs frequent and the ſkin moiſt, that one from theſe circumſtances might reaſonably have hoped that the fever would only prove a remittent or intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. About the end of the ſecond day, the heat began to abate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>ſkin</hi> was ſometimes (though rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) dry; but oftener, and indeed generally, it was moiſt and diſpoſed to ſweat.</p>
            <p>ON the firſt day, the ſweating was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly profuſe and general; on the ſecond day, it was more moderate: but on both theſe, there happened frequent and ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of the ſweatings; at which times the febrile heat increaſed, and the patient became more uneaſy. On the third day, the diſpoſition to ſweat was ſo much abated, that the ſkin was generally dry; only the forehead and backs of the hands continued moiſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:035733_0011_10065DF653E7F668"/>4. THE <hi>reſpiration</hi> was by no means fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent or difficult, but was ſoon accelerated by motion, or the fatigue of drinking a cup of any liquid.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE <hi>tongue</hi> was moiſt, rough and white, even to its tip and edges. On the ſecond day, its middle in ſome was brown. On the third day, the whiteneſs and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the tongue began to abate.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE <hi>thirſt</hi> in very few was great.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A <hi>nauſea, vomiting</hi> or frequent <hi>reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> to vomit, eſpecially after the exhibition of either medicines or food, came on gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the third day, as the fever began to leſſen; or rather as the fullneſs of the pulſe, heat, and diſpoſition to ſweat began to abate. Some indeed, but very few, on the firſt day, had a vomiting either bilious or phlegmatic.</p>
            <p n="8">8. VERY few complained of <hi>anxiety</hi> or oppreſſion about the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>raecordia</hi> or <hi>hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> nor was there any tenſion or hardneſs about the latter.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:035733_0012_10065DFAE96AC0B0"/>9. ON the firſt day they generally <hi>dozed</hi> much, but afterwards were very <hi>watchful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Reſtleſſneſs</hi> and almoſt continual <hi>jacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> came on the ſecond day.</p>
            <p n="11">11. A great <hi>deſpondency</hi> attended the ſick from the firſt attack.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THE <hi>ſtrength</hi> was greatly <hi>proſtrated</hi> from the firſt attack.</p>
            <p n="13">13. THE <hi>pain</hi> in the <hi>head, loins, &amp;c.</hi> of which they had complained (V) before the attack, were greatly increaſed, and in ſome, the pain in the forehead was very acute and darting; but thoſe pains went generally off the ſecond day.</p>
            <p n="14">14. THE <hi>face</hi> was fluſhed, and the eyes were hot, inflamed and unable to bear much light.</p>
            <p n="15">15. ON the firſt day, many of them, at times, were a little <hi>delirious,</hi> but afterwards not until the receſs of the fever.</p>
            <p n="16">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:035733_0013_10065DFC6FB3F1D0"/>16. THE <hi>blood</hi> ſaved at venaefection had not any inflammatory cruſt; in warm weather, it was florid like arterial blood, and continued in one ſoft homogeneous-like maſs, without any ſeparation of the <hi>ſerum</hi> after it was cold. When there was any ſeparation, the <hi>craſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi> was of too lax a texture.</p>
            <p n="17">17. THE <hi>ſtools,</hi> after the firſt day, were fetid, inclined to a black colour, and were very rarely bilious, ſoft or liquid, excepting when forced by art; for an obſtinate coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs attended the febrile ſtate.</p>
            <p n="18">18. THE <hi>urine</hi> was diſcharged in a large quantity, was pale, ſometimes limpid, and rarely of a higher than a ſtraw colour, except when the weather was very warm, and then it was more ſaturated, of a deep colour, and diſcharged in ſmaller quantities. It had a large cloud, except when it was very pale or limpid; but more generally it had a copious, white ſediment, even in the firſt day of the fever.</p>
            <p>ON the ſecond day, the urine continued to be diſcharged very copiouſly; in ſome, it
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035733_0014_10065DFE1C7C7330"/>was then turbid, and depoſited a more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſediment, than on the firſt day; this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment was ſometimes of a browniſh colour; in which caſe it was generally followed by bloody urine, either about the end of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond or beginning of the third day. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and quantity of the urine, diſcharged in equal times, were remarkably variable, being now limpid, then of a deeper colour, now diſcharged in a larger, then in a ſmaller quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, which could not be aſcribed to any change made either in the quantity or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. THE fever accompanied with thoſe (VI.) ſymptoms, terminated on the third day, or generally in leſs than 72 hours from the firſt attack, not by any aſſimulation, or coction and excretion of the morbid matter; for if by the latter, there would have been ſome critical diſcharge by ſweat, urine, ſtool, or otherwiſe, none of which happened; and if, by the former, nothing then would have remained but great debility. No; this fever did not terminate in either of theſe ſalutary ways, excepting in ſome, who were happy enough to have the diſeaſe conquered in the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035733_0015_10065DFFA4CBBD20"/>beginning by proper evacuations, and by keeping up a plentiful ſweat, till the total ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the fever, by proper mild diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics and diluents. But thoſe who had not that good fortune, however tranquil things might appear at this period, (as great debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and a little yellowneſs in the white of the eyes, ſeemed then to be the chief com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, excepting when the vomiting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued), yet the face of affairs was ſoon chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; for this period was ſoon ſucceeded by the ſecond <hi>ſtadium</hi>; a ſtate, though without any fever, much more terrible than the firſt: the ſymptoms in which were the following.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. 1. THE <hi>pulſe,</hi> immediately after the receſs of the fever, was very little more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than in health, but hard and ſmall. However, tho' it continued ſmall, it became, ſoon afterwards, ſlower and very ſoft; and this ſoftneſs of the pulſe remained as long as the pulſe could be felt. In many, in this ſtage of the diſeaſe, the pulſe gradually ſubſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until it became ſcarce perceptible; and this, notwithſtanding all the means uſed to ſupport and fill it; and when this was the caſe, the icteritious-like ſuffuſion, the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035733_0016_10065E045B6922B8"/>
               <hi>delirium,</hi> reſtleſſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> increaſed to a great degree. In ſome, the pulſe, after being exceedingly ſmall and ſcarce percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, recovered conſiderably its fullneſs; but that favourable appearance was generally of but ſhort continuance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>heat</hi> did not exceed the natural animal heat; and when the pulſe ſubſided, the ſkin became cold, and the face, breaſt and extremities acquired ſomewhat of a livid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>ſkin</hi> was dry when the weather was cold, but was moiſt and clammy when the weather was hot.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE <hi>reſpiration</hi> was natural or rather ſlow.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE <hi>tongue</hi> was moiſt and much clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than in the former (VI. 5.) ſtage, its tip and edges, as alſo the gums and lips, were of a more florid red colour than uſual.</p>
            <p n="6">6. VERY few complained of <hi>thirſt,</hi> though they had a great deſire for cold liquors.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035733_0017_10065E05E1712840"/>7. THE <hi>vomiting</hi> or <hi>reaching</hi> to vomit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and in ſome was ſo conſtant, that neither medicines nor aliment of any kind were retained. Some vomited blood; others only what was laſt exhibited, mixed with phlegm; and others again had what is called the <hi>black vomit.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">That which is called the <hi>black vomit,</hi> at firſt ſight, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be black; but on a more careful examination, I obſerved, that this colour proceeded from a great quantity of ſmall, flakey, black ſubſtances which floated in the liquor thrown up by vomit; but the colour of this liquor was much the ſame with that which the patient had laſt drank, and was by no means black. Thoſe black flakey ſubſtances are the bile mixed with, or adhering to the <hi>mucus</hi> which lined the ſtomach. For, upon diſſection of thoſe who died of this diſeaſe, not only in this but former years, I always obſerved that the <hi>mucus</hi> of the ſtomach was abraded, and the bile in its <hi>cyſtis</hi> was black and ſometimes very viſcid. In a lad who died of this diſeaſe in the beginning of the fourth day, and who was immediately opened, the bile was not only black, but had the conſiſtence of thick <hi>Venice</hi>-tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, and was exceedingly tough. On the inſide of the ſtomach, there were ſeveral carbuncles or gangrenousſpecks. And in all thoſe I have diſſected, who have died of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, I have not only always obſerved the ſame, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the blood was very fluid, and the veſſels of the <hi>viſcera</hi> much diſtended; from whence I have been very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to think, when the diſeaſe was not conquered in its firſt <hi>ſtadium,</hi> that, about the time of the termination of the fever, there was a <hi>metaſtaſis</hi> of the morbid matter to the <hi>viſcera.</hi>
               </note> The reaching to vomit
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035733_0018_10065E0768B29058"/>continued a longer or ſhorter time, according to the ſtate of the pulſe; for as that became fuller, and the heat greater, the reaching to vomit abated, and <hi>è contra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. THE inquietude was very obſtinate, and when they dozed, their ſlumbers were but ſhort and unrefreſhing. There were ſome who were drowſy; but theſe always awaked, after the ſhorteſt ſlumbers, with a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of ſpirits and ſtrength.</p>
            <p n="9">9. THE <hi>jactations</hi> or reſtleſsneſs was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing; it was frequently ſcarce poſſible to keep the patients in bed, though, at the ſame time, they did not complain of any anxiety or uneaſineſs; but if aſked how they did, the reply was, <hi>Very well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. THE <hi>debility</hi> was ſo great, that, if the patient was raiſed erect in the bed, or, in ſome, if the head was only raiſed from the pillow, while a cup of drink was given, the pulſe ſunk immediately, and became ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo ſmall, that it could ſcarcely be felt; at this time, they became cold, as in a <hi>hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripilatio,</hi> but without the anſerine-like ſkin:
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035733_0019_10065E096D97F388"/>their ſkin became clammy, the <hi>delirium</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, their lips and ſkin, eſpecially about the neck, face and extremities, together with their nails, acquired a livid colour.</p>
            <p n="11">11. THE <hi>delirium</hi> returned and increaſed; it was generally conſtant in thoſe whoſe pulſe was ſmall and ſubſiding.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THE inflammation of the <hi>tunica con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctiva</hi> or white of the eyes increaſed much, but without pain.</p>
            <p n="13">13. A <hi>yellowneſs</hi> in the white of the eyes, if it did not appear before in the febrile ſtate, became now very obſervable, and that icteritious-like colour was ſoon diffuſed over the whole ſurface of the body, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually acquiring a deeper ſaffron-like co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. In ſome indeed no yellowneſs was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, excepting in the white of the eyes, until a little before death, when it increaſed ſurpriſingly quick, eſpecially about the breaſt and neck.</p>
            <p n="14">14. THERE were many ſmall <hi>ſpecks,</hi> not raiſed above the ſkin, which appeared very
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035733_0020_10065E0CE173CC08"/>thick in the breaſt and neck; but leſs ſo in the extremities, and were of a ſcarlet, purple or livid colour.</p>
            <p n="15">15. IN women the <hi>menſtrua</hi> flowed, and ſometimes exceſſively, though not at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular periods.</p>
            <p n="16">16. THERE was ſuch a putrid diſſolution of the blood in this <hi>ſtadium</hi> of the diſeaſe, that, beſides the vomiting of blood former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned, and the bloody urine ſoon to be taken notice of, there were <hi>haemorrhagies</hi> from the noſe, mouth, ears, eyes, and from the parts which were bliſtered with <hi>cantha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides.</hi> Nay, in the year 1739 or 1745, there was one or two inſtances of an haemorrhage from the ſkin, without any apparent punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or loſs of any part of the ſcarf-ſkin.</p>
            <p n="17">17. AN obſtinate <hi>coſtiveneſs</hi> continued in ſome; in others, the ſtools were frequent and looſe; in ſome, they were black, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, large and greatly fatiguing; in others, when the ſtools were moderate, even though they were black, they gave great relief; in others again, the ſtools nearly reſembled tar
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035733_0021_10065E0FD3D87990"/>in ſmoothneſs, tenacity, colour and conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p n="18">18. THE <hi>urine</hi> was diſcharged in a large quantity, in proportion to the drink retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the patient: it was pale if the patient was not yellow; but if yellow, then it was of a deep-ſaffron colour; in either caſe it had a ſediment, or at leaſt a large cloud, which remained at the bottom of the glaſs; in ſome, it was very turbid, in others, it was bloody, and the quantity of blood diſcharged with the urine bore always ſome proportion to the ſtate of the pulſe; when that became fuller, the quantity of blood in the urine was diminiſhed: when the pulſe ſubſided, the bloody urine increaſed, and even returned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had ceaſed ſome days, ſoon after the pulſe became ſmaller.</p>
            <p>THIS ſtage of the diſeaſe continued ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeven or eight days before the patient died.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. WHEN this <hi>ſtadium</hi> (VIII.) of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe terminated in health, it was by a receſs or abatement of the vomiting, haemorrhagies,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035733_0022_10065E115AE51608"/>
               <hi>delirium,</hi> inquietude, jactations, and icteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious-like ſuffuſion of the ſkin and white of the eyes; while, at the ſame time, the pulſe became fuller, and the patient gained ſtrength, which, after this diſeaſe, was very ſlowly.</p>
            <p>BUT when it terminated in death, thoſe (VIII.) ſymptoms not only continued, but ſooner or later increaſed in violence, and were ſucceeded with the following, which may be termed the <hi>third ſtadium</hi> of the diſeaſe, which quickly ended in death.</p>
            <p n="10">X. THE pulſe tho' ſoft became exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſmall and unequal; the extremities grew cold, clammy and livid; the face and lips, in ſome, were fluſhed; in others, they were of a livid colour; the livid ſpecks increaſed ſo faſt, that in ſome, the whole breaſt and neck appeared livid; the heart palpitated ſtrongly; the heat about the <hi>praecordia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed much; the reſpiration became diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, with frequent ſighing; the patient now became anxious, and extremely reſtleſs; the ſweat flowed from the face, neck and breaſt; blood flowed from the mouth, or
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035733_0023_10065E12E1CE1550"/>noſe or ears, and in ſome, from all thoſe parts at once; the deglutition became diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; the hiccoughs and <hi>ſubſultus</hi> of the tendons came on, and were frequent; the patients trifled with their fingers, and picked the naps of the bed-cloaths; they grew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matous, or were conſtantly delirious. In this terrible ſtate, ſome continued eight, ten or twelve hours before they died, even after they had been ſo long ſpeechleſs, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any perceptible pulſation of the arteries in the wriſts; whereas, in all other acute diſeaſes, after the pulſe in the wriſts ceaſes, death follows immediately. When the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was <hi>very</hi> acute, violent convulſions ſeized the unhappy patient, and quickly brought this <hi>ſtadium</hi> to its fatal end. After death, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid blotches increaſed faſt, eſpecially about the face, breaſt, and neck, and the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction began very early, or rather increaſed very quickly.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. THIS was the progreſs of this terrible diſeaſe through its ſeveral <hi>ſtadia.</hi> But in hot weather, and when the ſymptoms in the firſt ſtage were very violent, it paſſed thro' thoſe ſtages, as Dr. <hi>Warren</hi> has likewiſe obſerved,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035733_0024_10065E17BB60AF00"/>with ſuch precipitation, that there was but little opportunity of diſtinguiſhing its diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>ſtadia</hi>; the whole tragedy having been finiſhed in leſs than 48 hours.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. IT was remarkable, that, 1. The infection was increaſed by warm and leſſened by cold weather. 2. The ſymptoms in the ſeveral <hi>ſtadia</hi> were more or leſs violent, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the heat or coolneſs of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In hot days, the ſymptoms were not only more violent, but in thoſe who ſeemed, in moderate weather, to be on the recovery, or at leaſt in no danger, the ſymptoms were all ſo greatly heightened, when the weather grew conſiderably warmer, as frequently to become fatal. In cool days, the ſymptoms were not only milder, but many, who were apparently in great danger in hot days, were ſaved from the very jaws of death by the weather becoming happily cooler. 3. The diſeaſe was generally more fatal to thoſe who lay in ſmall chambers not conveniently ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for the admiſſion of freſh air, to thoſe of an athletic and full habit, to ſtrangers who were natives of a cold climate, to thoſe who had the greateſt dread of it, and to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035733_0025_10065E1946919460"/>thoſe, who, before the attack of the diſeaſe, had overheated themſelves by exerciſe in the ſun, or by exceſſive drinking of ſtrong li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; either of which indeed ſeemed to render the body more ſuſceptible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Laſtly, the diſeaſe proved moſt certainly fatal to valetudinarians, or to thoſe who had been weakened by any previous diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. THE <hi>prognoſtics</hi> in the firſt <hi>ſtadium</hi> are theſe. 1. The more acute and conſtant the pains are in the head, loins, knees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the more the eyes are inflamed; the greater their inability is to bear light, and the more the face is fluſhed at the firſt attack, the fever and all the ſymptoms (VI.) in the firſt <hi>ſtadium</hi> will be the more violent. 2. The more intenſe the ſymptoms are in the firſt ſtate, the ſooner will the fever terminate. 3. The ſooner the diſeaſe runs thro' the firſt <hi>ſtadium,</hi> the ſhorter will be the duration of the ſecond, and <hi>è contra.</hi> 4. The ſhorter the duration is of the firſt, the greater and more certain is the danger in the ſecond ſtate. For when the fever terminated before the beginning of the third day, death ſeemed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035733_0026_10065E1B224573E8"/>inevitably to be the conſequence, as there was then no poſſibility of ſupporting the pulſe, and as all the bad ſymptoms were then hurried on with ſuch precipitation, that the patient generally died before the end of the fifth day, excepting a conſiderable cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the weather happily intervened; but on the contrary, it was a favourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance when the fever was protracted to the end of the third day, without any remarkable hardneſs or depreſſion of the pulſe. 5. A great depreſſion of the pulſe, about the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the fever, is bad, ſince, from that circumſtance, the vomitings, inceſſant jactations, the coldneſs and lividneſs of the extremities, haemorrhagies, <hi>delirium, &amp;c.</hi> are uſhered in with ſurpriſing celerity. 6. The more the ſtrength is proſtrated from the firſt attack, the greater is the danger. 7. A vomiting coming on early in the diſeaſe, and continuing or increaſing, is bad, and generally preſages the <hi>black vomit.</hi> 8. A ſediment in the urine in the firſt and ſecond day of the diſeaſe is bad, and the more copious the ſediment is, the greater is the danger.</p>
            <p n="14">

An early yellowneſs in the white of the eyes is bad: when it is obſervable about the end of the ſecond day, in the firſt <hi>ſtadium,</hi> the patient generally dies about the beginning of the fourth day from the firſt attack of the diſeaſe. But when the yellowneſs does not appear till the end of the third day, if the patient does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, the diſeaſe ſometimes continues to the 9th or 10th day of the ſecond <hi>ſtadium</hi> before the patient dies. When the yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſkin and eyes increaſes faſt and acquires ſoon a deep icteritious-like colour, the greateſt danger is to be apprehended. 2. If the inflammation of the white of the eyes increaſes, it is bad. 3. The more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and bloody-like the ſkin is where it has been bliſtered, the greater is the danger. 4. If the vomiting continues or increaſes, it is bad, but the <hi>black vomiting</hi> is generally mortal. 5. When the pulſe varies frequently in its fullneſs, being ſometimes ſmall, then fuller, it is bad. But there was leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence to be had on the pulſe in this than is common in other diſeaſes; for in ſome patients, in the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035733_0028_10065E214643BAB0"/>even within a few hours of their death, the pulſe, with reſpect to its fullneſs, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, equality and frequency, has continued like that of one in perfect health, although, from the other ſymptoms, the death of the patient could be foretold with great cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. 6. The more the ſtrength of the patient is reduced in the firſt, the greater is the danger in the ſecond <hi>ſtadium.</hi> 7. Great reſtleſſneſs, inquietude, an early <hi>delirium</hi> and a continuation of it are very bad. 8. Livid blotches about the neck and breaſt, a livid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the lips and nails, fluſhing of the face, or a livid colour thereof, are ſure ſigns of the quick approach of death. 9. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent looſe ſtools, which give not any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, are bad, and the ſooner they ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly happen, the greater is the danger: but thoſe which are black, and continue ſo without any abatement of the ſymptoms, are generally mortal. 10. Bloody urine and all haemorrhagies, excepting ſlight ones from the noſe, are bad; and the more copious they are, the greater is the danger. But a flux of the <hi>menſes,</hi> though not at their regular period, if attended with an abatement of the ſymptoms, is a favourable circumſtance,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035733_0029_10065E22CE8EF978"/>otherwiſe it is bad. 11. A ſuppreſſion of urine, eſpecially in thoſe, who, in the courſe of the diſeaſe, have had large diſcharges that way, is a certain ſign of the quick approach of death.</p>
