            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Q. <hi>What therefore do you learn from hence, to be the principall care and study of your life?</hi>

things in me. 1 That I may feel my miſery by ſin, and be deeply humbled under it.</p>

            <p>Queſt. <hi>Doth the Lord work thus by his Spirit in this order in all men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Yes; unleſs it be in an extraordinary way, and not by ordinary meanes. Becauſe it is expreſsly ſaid in the text, he ſhall convince the whole world of this.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But is not by world, meant the wicked of the world?</hi>

            <p>A. No; but the world of the Elect, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are called, 2 <hi>Cor:</hi> 5.19. For none of the wicked of the world are truly convinced of theſe things.</p>
            <p>Q: <hi>What is it therfore to convince?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. To make a thing plain and evident to ones mind, by demonſtrative argument; ſo as that he hath nothing to object againſt it, for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>A. 1 Not natural, which cometh by the light of natural conſcience, <hi>Rom:</hi> 2.15. But ſpiritual &amp; ſupernatural: becauſe it is here expreſsly ſaid, the Spirit ſhall conuince &amp;c:</p>

               <hi>Anſw:</hi> Becauſe no common work is attributed to the Spirit as a Comforter, throughout all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as this is; for conviction of the ſoul to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion is no comforting act, but rather matter of mourning.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe it is ſuch a work of conviction, as whereby Chriſt comes to be glorified by the ſoul, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. which is no common worke.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Becauſe the ſcope of the words is to comfort the hearts of the diſciples againſt Chriſts abſence <hi>viz:</hi> that the Spirit ſhall come, and thus convince the world; now it is no joy of heart to ſee men convicted ſo farr only as may leave them without excuſe, and breed more confuſion of face, but it is a joyfull thing to ſee the Spirit work on the hearts of a world of men to converſion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To convince of Sin.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Doth not the Law convince, and ſhew a man his ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes; as an inſtrument in the hand of the Spirit. <hi>Rom:</hi> 3.20. But the Spirit doth it as the principal agent by the Law.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Is there not a natural conviction by the light of nature (or the light of natural conſcience) and not by the light of the Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Yes; <hi>Rom:</hi> 2.15. But the conviction of ſin here is of a higher nature, it is ſupernatural, by a ſupernatural power of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What difference is there between natural and ſupernatural conviction of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Natural conviction by natural conſcience is much defiled and corrupted. <hi>Titus</hi> 1.15. It will ſhow ſome groſs ſinns, but it brings not to light thoſe which are moſt ſecret, and moſt dangerous; but ſuper-natural conviction or the Spirit by ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural conviction dealeth plainly, and diſcovereth
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:039167_0033_10141AD8F5D05248"/>
the moſt ſecret ſinns of the ſoul. 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 15.14, 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Natural conviction is uſually dark and weak, without deep affection, becauſe it is a dim light; but ſuper-natural conviction is ſtrong and over-powering and mightily affecting the heart. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. becauſe this is a clear light.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Natural conviction if it be ſometimes ſtrong and affecting the heart, yet it hurries the ſoul from God, it made Adam flee into the buſhes to hide himſelf, it ſent Saul to the witch, and Judas to the halter. Becauſe natural conſcience is but the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant of Divine juſtice, before whoſe throne it drags the ſoule, and ſo workes feare &amp; flight; but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural conviction inclines &amp; drawes the ſoul unto God, and to ſeek after Chriſt, becauſe it is the fruit of mercy from a mercifull Redeemer, from a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Spirit.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doth the Spirit undertake this work to convince of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw</hi> 1. That the Lord Jeſus might have all the glory of the converſion of a ſinner, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in this firſt act of conviction, for if it were in mans power to convince himſelf of ſin, then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ing of mens converſion (which is conviction) ſhould be attributed unto man, and ſo Chriſt ſhould not have all the glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Becauſe no man can or will ſee his ſin effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually untill the Spirit firſt comes, becauſe without the Spirit men flatter themſelves in their evill wayes
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:039167_0034_10141B1073691A30"/>
                  <hi>Pſal:</hi> 36.2, 3. Love their own peace, fly from the trouble of ſin as from the biting of a Serpent, or a temptation of the divel toward deſpair, and Sathan ſeeks by all means to blind mens eyes here <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21. and allthough ſin be the greateſt evill, yet a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart can never ſee his ſin till the Spirit comes.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>If the Spirit only doth, and can convince of Sin, What uſe are you to make of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> 1. That it is no eaſie matter to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually convinced, becauſe the eternal Spirit of the Lord Jeſus only can do it, and therefore it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to any created power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not to be diſcouraged though I find a blind mind, and a hard heart, that I cannot be convinced of ſin, becauſe the Spirit only is able to do it, and allthough the Word and Spirit hath given many knocks upon my heart, to break it, yet as it is in hard things one knock at laſt may do it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To go to Chriſt for this Spirit in prayer, when I find my heart hard; and to believe, that it is one of the moſt pleaſing requeſts that I can put up unto Chriſt, to deſire his Spirit to convince and humble my heart; all the glory of Chriſt (in ſome ſort) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed from this one work of the Spirit, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince &amp; break the heart for ſin.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is meant here by Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw</hi> Not only the act of ſin, but all the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that followes upon ſin, eſpecially the wrath of God for ſin.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe effectual conviction is here to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Lord Ieſus ſay the Spirit ſhall convince of ſin, without mentioning conviction of the wrath of God, and that miſery that followeth on ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A</hi> 1. Becauſe ſin is the greateſt evill, and the cauſe of Gods wrath, and therfore in ſaying Sin all other miſery is included.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe by effectual conviction &amp; humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spirit of God ſets on ſin upon the ſoul and makes it ly moſt heavy upon the heart, &amp; although he makes the ſence of wrath heavie, yet the Spirit by that doth but raiſe up the ſoul to make it the more fearfull of ſin the cauſe of it. <hi>Ier.</hi> 2.19.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why doth the Lord Ieſus uſe convince rather then humble?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. That he might ſhew where true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation begins, and that is in conviction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he might not only ſhew the work of humiliation, but the manner and way of it, which is not by any blind fears &amp; fleabitings (as it were) as in many reprobates, but by clear light &amp; demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration out of the word, over-pouring all reaſons and ſhiftings (which is in the nature of conviction) that their condition is ſinfull and miſerable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To teach us that not only the great work of humiliation upon the heart is the work of the Spirit
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:039167_0036_10141B146D084648"/>
but that the firſt and leaſt beginings of it even the very firſt ſight and conviction of ſin is his work alſo, and not our own.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is there in ſin, of which the Spirit convinceth and humbleth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Three things. 1. The exceeding great evill and horrible nature of ſin it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The terrible wrath of God for ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The pollution of the perſon that ſinneth, that he is wholly poſſeſſed with ſin, and univerſally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed by ſin in every thing be doth and is able to do, and all this becauſe he hath no part in Jeſus Chriſt by Faith.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What need is there that the Spirit ſhould ſet forth the exceeding evill of ſin?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw</hi> Becauſe ſin is that evill which principally grieves the heart of God, and therefore when the Spirit comes to correct &amp; humble for ſin, he makes it to grieve our hearts moſt, and to be exceeding bitter to the ſoul. The Divels and reprobates, to whom the Comforter never comes, they feel the terrour of ſin, but never feel the evil of ſin.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What need is there of conviction of the wrath of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That the ſoul of man might be more deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſenſibly humbled for ſin the cauſe of it, for the heart of man being ſenſual, it cannot ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly feel ſin which is a more ſpiritual evill, but by means of Gods terrour, (as by the burning of the

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe otherwiſe the heart would bee lifted up from what litle good it ſeeth in it ſelf, and never go to Chriſt for all good.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What meaſure of conviction and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for ſin is neceſſary?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So much ſight and ſenſe of ſin is neceſſary as may make ſin a burthen unſupportable to the ſoul <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.2. <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What neceſſity is there of ſuch a meaſure?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe ſin and the wrath of God are in themſelves the greateſt &amp; moſt unſupportable evills hence the ſoul muſt feel them ſo, or elſe the Spirit ſhould not let them feel them as they be.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Becauſe Chriſt hath felt ſin as a burthen unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, therefore the ſoul muſt feel it ſo, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſhould not feelingly know what mercy Chriſt hath ſhewed unto it in bearing ſin for it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Deliverance from ſin &amp; wrath of God, would not be matter of unſpeakable joy, unleſs ſinn was matter of unſupportable burthen.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe ſuch is a mans love of ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Chriſt, that he will never go to Chriſt to take ſin and wrath of God away, while he can bear them quietly without intollerable preſſure under it:
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:039167_0038_10141B18B58DE278"/>
and therefore we ſee many that having only ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>victions &amp; light fears &amp; troubles for ſin, they can eaſe themſelves by ſome light confeſſion &amp; praying or by buſineſs, or ſports, or mirth, hence they live in their ſin and muſt periſh for it.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How much ſenſe and feeling of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable burthen is needfull?</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the end of all troubles in the Elect is to bring them to Chriſt, they muſt come to him, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. Hence they muſt be reſtleſs till they find peace in him, and can never be ſayd to be humbled if they can find any reſt without him: hence that promiſe, <hi>Mat:</hi> 11.28. is the firſt and moſt ordinary ſupport and ground of comfort to an humbled ſinner.</p>

and forced unquietneſs, but a ſpecial ſpirituall and ſecret puſh of the Spirit, which puts them dayly forward, either in a more gentle or terrible manner.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But may not ſome be thus reſtleſs, and yet not know it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, and the reaſon is becauſe uſually many judg of this reſtleſnes only by terrible afright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when as there may be an intellectual ſenſe of ſin, or a deep apprehenſion of ſin and wrath in the mind and underſtanding, which may make the ſoul reſtleſs without ſuch affectionate affrightments As there may be great joy from a deep apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome good, without laughing &amp; dauncing, and as there may be great affrightments without light, as ſometimes in a dream, ſo there may be a great humbling light without affrightments, and violent raging fears.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How may ſuch come to know it that think they never have been thus affected with ſin, and yet indeed have been ſo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Two wayes. 1. If the ſoul doth eſteem Chriſt conſidered as a Redeemer from ſin &amp; wrath of God, as the greateſt good, it is a certain ſign that ſuch an one hath ben ſenſible of ſin and wrath of God as the greateſt evill, though they ſhould think they were never ſo, for how elſe could deliverance from ſin and the wrath of God be ſo precious, if ſin and wrath were not moſt heavy; as (for example)
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:039167_0041_101467636B6AEDE0"/>
how can a man eſteem bread &amp; water as a greater good then all the gold and ſilver in the world, if he was not ſenſible of a hunger-bitten and thirſty condition before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If any ſoul hath a part in Chriſt without ſenſe of ſin (as he thinks) at his firſt converſion, yet he ſhall find that it was there indeed by his after converſions to God, for Peter and the reſt of the diſciples, after they were converted, were to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain converted <hi>Math:</hi> 18.3. Now many gracious chriſtians ſhall find much ſenſe of ſin, and terrour of God affecting them all their life in their humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations before God which they neuer felt at firſt, yet notwithſtanding theſe after-returnings do evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew what ingredients were in them at firſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not this conviction and humiliation a conſequent of faith, and following ones being in Chriſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is indeed ſome kind of conviction and humiliation for ſin which followes faith, but in this place Chriſt expreſsly ſpeaks of that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>victi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; humiliation for ſin which is wrought by the Spirit in the ſoul becauſe it believeth not in Chriſt, and therefore is before faith is fully wrought.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>How may it appear that conviction of ſin is the firſt work of the Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw:</hi> 1. Becauſe none without this can feel their need of Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, and ſeek after him before they have him. For the whole need not a Phyſician, but the ſick <hi>Math.</hi> 9.12.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:039167_0042_10141B1D702A94E8"/>2. Becauſe otherwiſe none would be glad of Chriſt when he is to be given to them. A condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man is only glad of pardon; and they only that were pricked at the heart <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. gladly receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word of the Goſpel. <hi>verſe</hi> 41.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Otherwiſe none would ſtay with Chriſt after they had received him As the ſtony ground ſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Math.</hi> 13. becauſe it had not depth of earth (or deep humiliation) if ſin was never very bitter, a ſmall temptation to ſin would make men eaſily to forſake Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What uſe are you to make of this doctrine</hi> viz: <hi>conviction of ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I learn hence, that the firſt work of the Spirit upon the ſoul, is not that myſtical Union which is between Chriſt &amp; the ſoul (as ſome think) Chriſt doth not firſt unite himſelf to the ſoul, and then it is convinced of ſin and humbled for ſin, and then believeth in Chriſt, but the ſoul is convinced of ſin before this union; for if the Spirit firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the ſoul of ſin becauſe it believeth not in Chriſt, and conſequently becauſe it hath no part in Chriſt by any union to him; then the Spirit doth not firſt unite the ſoul &amp; Chriſt together, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward convinceth it of ſin. He that is united to Chriſt is in actuall favour with God, but he that believeth not is out of favour, condemned allready, and the wrath of God abideth on him. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.18. <hi>Chap</hi> 3.36. if therefore the Spirit firſt convinceth the ſoul
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:039167_0043_10146768DE39CB00"/>
of ſin becauſe it believeth not in Chriſt, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is out of favour with God, condemned all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready abiding under the wrath of God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not as yet united to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What evill is there in holding this opinion that the ſoul is united to Christ firſt before it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and humbled for ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Becauſe by this principle, it is not fit to preach the Law to any of the Elect, to ſhew them thereby their curſed eſtate: for if they be united to Chriſt before any conviction of ſin by the Law, their eſtate is not curſed but bleſſed, union to Chriſt being the root of all bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe by this principle there is no need of preaching the Goſpel, to draw the ſeperated ſoul from Chriſt, to unite it to Chriſt: becauſe before conviction of ſin, and therefore much more before conviction of Chriſts Righteouſneſs in the Goſpel, this union is ſuppoſed to be wrought.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe by this principle one may be united to Chriſt, and yet have a heart corrupt and wholly united to ſin: becauſe it ſuppoſeth ſuch an union to Chriſt which is before ſo much as the leaſt ſight and ſenſe of ſin.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5 Becauſe by this principle, a man muſt bee juſtified, adopted, reconciled to God, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith, but even before he either ſeeth or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſin, or need of Chriſt: for at that inſtant a man hath his union to Chriſt, he hath communion neceſſarily in all the benefits of Chriſt, as Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Adoption, Reconciliation, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.1. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12. But this is contrary to the whole currant of Scripture, which affirms that we are not juſtified without faith, but by faith; and that not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratively in the Court of our conſciences, but in the Court of heaven, and ſight of God. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11.

The Spirit like a wiſe carpenter hews and cuts the ſoul to make it fit for union, as he doth the beams of an houſe; but this hewing &amp; cuting and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the ſoul is no fruit of union, no more then hewing the rafters of a houſe are a fruit of union to the main beam.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The curſe of the Law belongs to ſinners as ſinners, but not the promiſes. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. And if the Goſpell belongs to ſinners as ſinners, then all ſinners ſhall be ſaved throughout the whole world, the Goſpel indeed is offered to the vileſt ſinner, but the promiſe of it is actually applyed to none but humbled and believing ſinners.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What followes from this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That one reaſon why ſome are ſo long before they ſee their juſtification, is becauſe there is ſome flaw in their humiliation; unſound humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:039167_0055_1014677C5C6516B8"/>
unſound peace, little humiliation, little peace in ſence of our juſtification; for though an humbled heart hath many objections againſt believing, yet when the Spirit comes, he will convince you of righteouſneſs as he did formerly of ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That ſight &amp; ſence of ſin ſhould not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage any one from believing in Chriſts righteouſnes becauſe to ſuch perſons onely Chriſts Righteoſneſs is revealed by the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence it followeth, that when a ſinner is humbled he may then without preſumption believe a proud and unhumbled ſpirit cannot believe, an humbled ſinner cannot preſume, nor yet believe too ſoon; preſumption is the proper quality of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled ſoul, for if now is the time of Chriſts reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his righteouſnes while the ſoul is humbled, then it is the time of our aplying of Chriſts righteouſnes without preſumption.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence it followeth, that an humbled ſinner ſhould not ſeek firſt for ſanctification, but juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or a clear revelation of Chriſts righteouſnes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence it followes the way to keep aſſurance of our juſtification is to keep our hearts in an humbled frame, effectually convinced of ſin; and therefore hate that doctrine as hell it ſelf which under a colour of advancing the glorious eſtate of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in Chriſt, would not have him lament, mourn &amp; be humbled for ſin; when as Chriſt dwels with a contrite and broken heart. <hi>Iſa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And thoſe that confeſs ſin under the Goſpel (which is therefore no old Teſtament ſpirit onely as ſome ignorantly and perverſly upbraid it,) God is righteous to forgive their ſin. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 1.9. And when the Spirit of grace, and ſupplication, is poured out on men, under the Goſpel, then there ſhall be a great mourning. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 11.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not his judgment of puniſhment on the wicked, for Chriſt ſpeaks of that judgment which is a comfort to the elect, now judgment of puniſhment is not ſuch a great comfort to them, but it is his judgment of Government whereby Satan the Prince of this world is judged, or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and conſequently all power in heaven and

earth is in the hands of Chriſt to doe for his people, and hence it is ſayd, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.22. God the Father judgeth no man, but hath put all judgment into the hand of his Son.</p>
               <p>Queſt, <hi>Is this judgment of government meant of Chriſts univerſal government, and of governing the world, or of his ſpeciall government in governing, and ruling in his peoples hearts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is meant of both, yet ſo as that the generall government of Chriſt is in reſpect of the ſpecial government of his peoples hearts, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the world without Chriſts government of it, ſo Sathan is God and Ruler and Prince of it, eſpecially in mens hearts, ſo the Lord Jeſus cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this power of Sathan, and deſtroying this god and prince of this world, he now governeth all things that he may rule eſpecially in mens hearts ſubduing Sathan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſin.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes becauſe it is part of Chriſts judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary and ſpeciall power, to give power againſt ſin, and ſathan, unto all fruitful obedience, and thence it is that ſanctification is called judgment. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 42.3. <hi>till judgment come to victory,</hi> But this only is not meant here, but alſo his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal power of government over all creatures as well as Divels for as by conviction of ſin, the Spirit humbles, or therby is wrought humiliation,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:039167_0058_10141B349C77D398"/>
and as by conviction of righteouſneſs, Faith is wrought, ſo by conviction of Chriſts univerſall power of government the ſoul falls down before Chriſt, and ſubmits to Chriſt, and ſo ſanctification is wrought,</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is meant therfore more particularly by conviction of judgment, or what doth the Spirit cenvince a juſtified perſon of, when he convinceth of judgment?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3 Things; 1 That the Prince of the world being judged, and conquered by Chriſt in aboliſhing all ſin by juſtification, that now Jeſus Chriſt hath therefore all lawfull power of right to rule them as their King.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That now they ought therefore to ſubmit to Chriſt, he being now King as well as Saviour to them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.8, 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they alſo ſhall ſubmit to him &amp; that their ſins ſhall be ſubdued by Chriſt their King. <hi>Ro:</hi> 6.14.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why doth the Spirit thus convince of Judgment in the laſt place?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the great and laſt complaint of a perſon juſtified by Chriſts Righteouſneſs is the power of ſinn, crying out who ſhall deliver me from it, and ſaying what am I the better if my ſins are pardoned and not ſubdued, hence at laſt the Lord comforts them by revealing him unto them who hath all judgment and power to ſubdue their ſin, and alſo how they ought and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:039167_0059_10146782D7AD14B8"/>
ſhall be ſubdued to his bleſſed will.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What think you then of ſuch as live looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after Faith in their juſtification?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their Faith is but a fancy, and a meer deluſion, beaauſe all that are juſtified are laſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of judgment alſo.</p>
               <p>Queſt <hi>How may it be known when Christ ſets up this judgment of rule in ſubduing his peoples ſins?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In three degrees. 1. When the ſoul cannot but yield to Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. That as the ſoul when ſin reigned was neceſſarily acted by ſin, ſo now it is neceſſarily holy when Chriſt reigns in it. <hi>Rom</hi>: 5.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the ſoul yields for a time to ſin, yet at laſt it goeth to Chriſt to take it away. <hi>Pſal</hi>: 119.6, 7. Chriſt is then ſet upon his throne of judgment when this honour is put upon him by us to ſubdue our enemies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If Chriſt doth not come preſently and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſin, then the ſoul ſighs under his bondage till Chriſt comes and takes it away. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24.</p>
               <p>Queſt <hi>Is not their ſin great therefore who are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and thinke that their ſins ſhall never be ſubdued?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes verily; for this is directly croſs to what the Spirit witneſſeth, and convinceth of when he comes to comfort, and it is therfore the great ſin of many who come to Chriſt that he would take away their ſin, yet do not believe that he will;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:039167_0060_10141B375BC4CB90"/>
for thoſe that be convinced of righteouſneſs ſhall be allſo convinced of judgment, and that Chriſt ſhall reigne to ſubdue their ſinns by ſome means or other, by little and little, by Ordinances, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Aflictions, frownes, ſmiles, and by death it ſelf at laſt.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why is ſo much ſin unſubdued left in them which they ſee they cannot ſubdue?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To convince them that this judgment or this power is in the hand of Chriſt only and not in their own.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the duty therefore of ſuch as are now juſtified?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1 To ſee that now they ought to live to Chriſt, and ſubmit to Chriſt who hath all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commited to him for their ſakes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they not only ought, but alſo ſhall doe ſo becauſe the Prince of this world is judged, and therefore all righteouſneſs and judgment to ſubdue ſin is in the hand of Chriſt.</p>
