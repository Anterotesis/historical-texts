            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I earnestly pray that the Blessings of Heaven may descend upon Your Person, and upon Your Virtuous Consort, whom the Lord hath made to be a Pattern of Humility and real Piety, and upon the many hopeful Branches of Your Family, who are th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THAT <hi>a General Conversion of the Israelitish Nation,</hi> is according to the Scriptures to be expected in the latter Ages of the World, is nothing but what Christians in all Ages have believed. So the <hi>Ancients</hi> (Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as they are called) who lived towards the Primitive Times. So the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the dark Days of <hi>Popery.</hi> So the chief <hi>Reformers</hi> in this and the last Century, all which I have elsewhere made to appear, and therefore shall not again mention the Names of those great Authors, whether ancient or modern, which have declared their Judgment, and given their Testimony to what we assert as a glorious Truth. Some few of late have opposed the commonly received Doctrine, as a Scriptureless Notion. <hi>Iacobus Batalerius</hi> a <hi>Dutch</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister hath published a small Tract, entituled <hi>Dissertatio de Israelitarum Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versione à Paulo ad Romanos undecimo capite pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This Author calls that Truth which the greatest Worthies in this Age have believed, <hi>a Thing incredible, a golden Mountain, the Vision of one asleep,</hi> &amp;c. He pretends that <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Distribution of the Tribes is not Mystical, but Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and that <hi>Exekiel</hi>'s City was that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> destroyed, and that whereas the Name whereby that City shall be called is, <hi>The Lord is there,</hi> that was fulfilled (he says Page 184, 221.) in that <hi>Zorobabel</hi> who was a Type of Christ, and afterwards Christ himself was personally present in that <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> He thinks the Second Temple did answer that described by <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> Most certainly when the <hi>Iews</hi> read such Things written by Christians, they laugh them to Scorn, and are harden'd in their Infidelity. <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Temple shall never be prophaned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.7, 8. But the Second Temple was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned by <hi>Antiochus, Pompey, Titus,</hi> &amp;c. Another pretty Conceit he has (p. 62, 63.) concerning the <hi>New Ierusalem, viz.</hi>
                  <q>That after the Old <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was destroyed, the City was built again in the Days of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and then inhabited by Christians, but there was no Temple in it, so was <hi>Rev.</hi> 21, 22. fulfilled.</q>
This is somewhat like <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s Interpretation, who because <hi>Constantine</hi> turned the Heathen Temples which he found in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> into Christian, supposeth that to be the <hi>New-Ierusalem.</hi> I mention not these Things to confute them, for the very Recitation is Confutation suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; yet out of this Author has Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> taken (in a Manner all) his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections against a future Conversion of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation.

And if the <hi>Iews</hi> are not guilty of the Sin against the Holy Ghost, notwithstanding the Heinousness of their Guilt in crucifying the Son of God, and preferring a Murderer to him, who knows but that Infinite Grace may convert and save them? Especially considering that some Thousands of those very Individual Persons, who did with wicked Hands crucifie the Prince of Life, were nevertheless (such is the exceeding Riches of the Grace of God) brought to true Repentance, and their Sins forgiven, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. To say that because that Nation is under the Guilt of such an unparallell'd Crime as that of crucifying their Saviour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no Probability of their Conversion, does not agree with Zech. 12.10. <hi>They shall look on him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him.</hi> This Learned and Worthy Doctor in his first Volume, p. 375. expresseth himself with great Modesty: His Words are, <hi>Tho' I am unwilling to recede from that charitable Opinion of most Christians, that there shall once be a Calling of them home, yet see I not how the Supposal of the universal Call of the whole Nation, as of one Man, can be digested without some Alloy and Mitigation.</hi> And again, p. 377. <hi>That they shall be generally called, and that not 'till the</hi> Antichrist <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and the Fulness of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>come in, as some Circumstantiate, the Thing needs clearer Evidence than has yet been produced.</hi> As for that Notion of <hi>a Universal Conversion of the</hi> Jews <hi>to a Man,</hi> I confess the School Doctors have asserted it. So <hi>Aquinas, Cajetan, Dominicus à Soto.</hi> But our Authors generally affirm only a <hi>National, and not a Universal Conversion.</hi> So judicious Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> in his excellent Sermon on <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. But this Reverend Author, besides what has been mentioned concerning the <hi>Iews</hi> having rejected Christ and the Offers of the Gospel, produceth chiefly Two Objections. One is, <hi>That the</hi> Jews <hi>are a Brood of</hi> Antichrist. But (saith he) <hi>The End of</hi> Antichrist <hi>will not be Conversion, but Perdition.</hi> The Argument must stand thus; If the Body of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation be Antichristian, then the Body of that Nation shall not be converted: But so it is; therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Both the Consequents of the Proposition, and the Assumption, are to be denied.

Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (who is an Interpreter of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

But as for the grand Sin of <hi>Antichrist, viz. Idolatry,</hi> we know the <hi>Iews</hi> have dreaded that Sin ever since the <hi>Babylonian Captivity.</hi> So that to say there is no Hope of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, because they are of the Brood of Antichrist, seems not to be an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of Weight enough to cause us to recede from that which has been <hi>the received Opinion of most Christians,</hi> as the Doctor acknowledges this of the <hi>Iews</hi> future Conversion to have been.</p>
               <p>He does moreover object <hi>that the Drift of the Apostle in that eminent Place,</hi> Rom. 11. <hi>is not to shew that the Iews shall be all hereafter called, only to prove that they were not wholly cast off.</hi> But it is clear that the Design of the Apostle is to convince those <hi>Gentiles</hi> of their Error who insulted over the Blind and rejected Jewish Nation. He therefore tells them that not only some of the then <hi>Iews</hi> did belong to Election, but that the Obduration which the Body of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was punished with, was only, <gap reason="foreign">

To say that he intends the Elect, or <hi>Spiritual Israel,</hi> is against the Drift of his whole Discourse, who throughout the 9<hi>th,</hi> 10<hi>th,</hi> and 11<hi>th</hi> Chapters, speaks of <hi>Israel according to the Flesh.</hi> Besides, he says he would acquaint them with a <hi>Mystery</hi> which before they we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It was no Mystery to them that all the Elect should be saved: But tho' the Prophets had declared it, they were as ignorant of a future Conversion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> as the believing <hi>Iews</hi> were of the Conversion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which seemed a very strange Doctrine to them: Altho' it was revealed unto, and foretold by the Prophets, they did not of a long Time understand it. Now if the Apostle speaks of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Israel,</hi> nothing can be imagined more clear and express for a National Conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> than those his Words are. For <hi>the Salvation of all Israel</hi> connot intend <hi>a few,</hi> or any thing less than a <hi>National Conversion. All Israel</hi> in due Time to be converted, is put in <hi>Opposition to a Remnant,</hi> and to <hi>the diminutive Number</hi> that were saved in the Apostles Days. This <hi>Salvation of all Israel</hi> is called <hi>their Fulness,</hi> and <hi>their being received again,</hi> v. 12, 15. The future Conversion of the <hi>Iews</hi> will equalize that of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Now the Conversion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> has been National: Hence it is said <hi>the World, i. e. Gentile Nations,</hi> have been <hi>reconciled</hi>; their <hi>future Conversion</hi> will be like <hi>their present Rejection:</hi> Now that is not of a few particular Persons, but of the Body of the Nation.

               <p>Since that I have met with some others who have written on this Subject. There is an Anonymous Author has published a Book with this Title, <hi>Tractatus de Regno Ecclesiae glorios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I perceive by Mr. <hi>Iurieu, (p.</hi> 395.) that <hi>Whitsius,</hi> one of the learned Professors at <hi>Utrecht,</hi> has lately written on this Subject, and that he does not only acknowledge a future Conversion of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but that they shall return to their own Land again, and rebuild <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; which is a Thing doubted of by many who are clear for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; but that Book I have not yet seen.

               <p>As for the manner of their Conversion, I still encline (with Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> and others) to think that it will be effected as <hi>Paul</hi>'s was, by a miraculous Appearance of Christ to some of them, and be carried on by the Preaching of the Gospel, with a most glorious down pouring of the Holy Spirit therewith. My Reasons I have expressed in my <hi>Diatriba de signo filii hominis &amp; secundo Messiae adventis</hi>; which was Printed at <hi>Amsterdam, Anno</hi> 1682. As to <hi>the Time of their Conversion,</hi> I have not much to say: The <hi>Turks</hi> keep them from possessing the Land of their Fathers.

               <p>That the Turkish Empire is near some fatal <hi>Catastrophe,</hi> not only the present Posture of Affairs there, but what is written in the <hi>Apocalypse</hi> gives us Ground to believe.

We must not be wise above what is written, and therefore we may not determine how long the Conflagration will last. <hi>Noah</hi>'s Floud continued for many Days and Months, he was a whole Year in the Ark. The Weapons of <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s <hi>Gog</hi> are <hi>Seven Years in burning,</hi> Ezek. 39.9. No Doubt but that the Conflagration of the Great Day will last a long Time. Many will perish as soon as the Fire begins; but the wicked shall not be raised until the Conflagration be over: Nor (as we shall endeavour to prove) of a long Time after that. When as the Saints shall rise when the Heavens and the Earth, which now are, shall begin to be on Fire.

               <p>There are judicious Interpreters who suppose that the Angel speaketh of a <hi>First Resurrection</hi> in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. where it is said <hi>that many of them who sleep in the Dust of the Earth shall awake:</hi> Since it is not said <hi>All,</hi> but <hi>Many</hi> that sleep awake, when as at the Day of Judgment, <hi>not only many, but All</hi> will rise. Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huit,</hi> in their Commentaries on <hi>Daniel,</hi> are of Opinion that it is only a <hi>Mystical Resurrection</hi> of the <hi>Iewish Nation</hi> which is there spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of; with whom I perceive my worthy Friend Mr. <hi>Samuel Clark</hi> in his Notes on that Place does concur. But the Reason alledged has no Cogency in it: For (as <hi>Glass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us</hi> observes) <hi>Many</hi> is in the Scripture taken, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for <hi>All, Isa.</hi> 52.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 19. and 12.8. We may not unnecessarily recede from a Literal Interpretation. And inasmuch as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church did build her Faith of the Resurrection on this Text in <hi>Daniel</hi> in a special Manner, (as may be seen in <hi>Manasseh-Ben-Israel</hi> in his Book <hi>De Resurrectione</hi>) I think we should not exclude the Literal Sense of the Words.</p>
               <p>Now taking it for granted that the Resurrection here spoken of, is that which shall be at the Judgment of the Great Day, this Text seems to be a very pregnant and clear Proof that the just shall rise unto everlasting Life a long Time before the wicked shall rise unto Shame and everlasting Contempt: For the Angel does plainly intimate, both that <hi>this Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> shall be <hi>when the Time, Times and half Time</hi> is fully expired; and when the <hi>King of the North,</hi> having planted the Tabernacles of his Palace between the Seas in the glorious holy Mountain, shall come to his End. <hi>But this King of the North will come to his End long before the ultimate Resurrection,</hi> as in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of our Discourse will be made to appear: Therefore some shall awake out of the Dust of the Earth unto Everlasting Life long before that. I omit here Mr. <hi>Burroughs</hi>'s Argument (on <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. p. 133.) that <hi>standing up</hi> in this Resurrction is promised to <hi>Daniel</hi> as a special Favour to him as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saint, and that therefore the Place cannot be meant of the General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection which shall be at the ultimate Judgment. What is that <hi>End of Days</hi> in which <hi>Daniel</hi> must <hi>stand up,</hi> that is, <hi>rise from the dead?</hi> Does it not mean that after the Time, Times and half a Time (when <hi>Iohn</hi> also saith that the Mystery of God will be finished) are expired, this first Resurrection will begin.</p>
               <p>Reas. 3. <hi>There are Scriptures in the</hi> New Testament <hi>which intimate that the Resurrection of the just will precede the universal Resurrection.</hi>

Mr. <hi>Strong</hi> (in his Thirty Sermons p. 279.) thinks that this Text is not to be understood of the General Resurrection, because when the last Trumpet sounds, not Elect only, but Reprobates are brought to judgment, when as this Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet in <hi>Matthew</hi> gathers only the Elect from the Four Winds; therefore (says he) <hi>it seems that none shall bear this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>coming in the Clouds of Heaven</hi> is peculiar unto his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to begin the great Day of Judgment, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13. with <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11.

Another Scripture which seems to speak no less, is that <hi>Luke</hi> 14.14, 15. where we read of <hi>Blessedness, and Recompences, and the Kingdom of God at the Resurrection of the just.</hi> The ultimate Resurrection will be a Resurrection of the unjust: It is called <hi>a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Damnation,</hi> John 5.29. The Righteous shall <hi>rise and reign</hi> long before that. The Expression seems clearly to import that there is a Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>peculiar to the Righteous,</hi> therefore called <hi>the Resurrection of the just.</hi> And in <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35. It is said, <hi>They are the Children of God, being the Children of the Resurrection. Laurentius</hi> in his Problem, <hi>De Regno Millenario,</hi> p. 25 argues thus, The universal Resurrection is not proper to the Children of God; but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection spoken of in <hi>Luke</hi> 20. is proper to the Children of God; for the Children of that Resurrection are said to be the Children of God; therefore it is not the Universal Resurrection which in that Place is spoken of. Another Scripture which some have produced, as confirming a Distinction of Time in the Resurrection, is that 1 Cor. 15.22, 23, 24. <hi>In Christ shall all be made alive, but every Man in his own Order, Christ the first Fruits, afterwards they that are Christ's at his Coming, after that the End.</hi> It is true that all shall rise <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>at the Coming of Christ</hi>: But a large Space of Time is contained under that Expression of <hi>the Lord's Coming.</hi> His first Coming comprehends more than <hi>Sixteen Hundred Years.</hi> We are sure that under the Dispensation which will begin at his <hi>Second Coming</hi> there will be a <hi>Thousand Years,</hi> but how much more we know not.</p>
               <p>The Apostle asserts <hi>an Order in the Resurrection,</hi> which implies that some shall have a Preference therein as to the Time of their Resurrection: They that are united to Christ shall rise when his next Personal Appearance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins: But it is not said, that <hi>the End when the Kingdom shall be delivered to the Father, and all the dead shall rise,</hi> will be <hi>then,</hi> or as soon as they who are in Christ shall rise, but that it will be afterwards. Our <hi>English</hi> Translation does very much obscure the true Meaning of that Scripture; The Adverb <gap reason="foreign">

23. It is there and frequently put for that which comes a considerable Time after, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.28. We proceed therefore unto another Scripture, which seems to intimate that the righteous shall rise in the Morning, but the wicked in the Evening of the great Day of Judgment, it is that <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 28, Where the Lord says to the Overcomer, <hi>I will give him Power over the Nations, and I will give him the Morning Star.</hi> Some Expositors have wearied themselves in vain by seeking to accomodate this Promise to a State of the Church before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; when as it is certain that every one of the glorious Things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to the <hi>Overcomer,</hi> in Christ's Epistles to the Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accomplished at, and not before the Day of Judgment. Now admitting the Doctrine of the first Resurrection, it is easie to see how the Saints reign on Earth and have Power over the Nations; but if the Resurrection be <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> of just and unjust, all at the same Moment, it is not easie to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate how Nations and Kingdoms shall be ruled by them.</p>
               <p>Christian <hi>Victors</hi> shall <hi>in the Morning of the Resurrection,</hi> as soon as the great Day shall dawn, <hi>be with Christ,</hi> and partake with him in his Kingdom. Thus is the <hi>Morning Star given to them.</hi>

                  </gap>, Historically, and in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as cannot easily be answered. Let the following Arguments be duly weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a known, received Maxim among Divines, that in the Interpretation of Scripture we may not depart from the Literal Sense, if it will stand with the Analogy of Faith.</hi> For Men to make <hi>Allegories</hi> where there are none, is to obtrude their own Imaginations instead of Scripture. Now saith Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> (Fol. 943.) <hi>The</hi> 20<hi>th of Apocalypse, of all the Narrations in that Book, seems to be the most plain and simple, most free of Allegory, and of the Involution of Prophetical Figures.</hi> How can a Man then take a Passage of so plain, and ordinarily expressed Words as those about the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> are, in any other Sense than the usual and Literal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is evident by the Law of Opposites.</hi> The <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second Resurrection</hi> must needs be of the same Kind, otherwise the Discourse would be <hi>Illogical,</hi> which may not be supposed. <hi>Piscator</hi> speaks like a Logician as well as a Divine when he says, <hi>In omni Legitim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> opponuntur sub eodem genere.</hi> In every Rational Distribution the opposite Parts are of the same Kind. Here is a Distribution or Distinction of dead Men living again, some at the Beginning of the Thousand Years, the rest not until the Thousand Years were finished. But those that live again after the Thousand Years, live as to their Bodies. That <hi>the Second Resurrection</hi> is <hi>not Metaphorical</hi> but <hi>real,</hi> and to be taken in a Literal Sense is clear and indisputable. For then <hi>the dead, small and great, shall stand before God and be judged according to what is written in the Books, and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it,</hi> Ver. 12.13. This is the <hi>Second Resurrection</hi> which comes after the Thousand Years; and it is certainly a Resurrection of the Body. And thus does Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> argue, <hi>It would</hi> (says he) <hi>be a most harsh and violent Interpretation to say that [Dead] and consequently [living again from the dead] should not,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>trobique, <hi>be taken in the same Meaning.</hi> For such a Speech in ordinary Construction implies, that as <hi>some of the dead lived again</hi> in the Beginning of the Thousand Years, in that Sense <hi>the rest of the dead</hi> should live again at the End of the Thousand Years, and <hi>é contra,</hi> in what Manner the rest of the dead should live again at the End of the Thousand Years, in that Manner those that were beheaded for Jesus, lived again in the Beginning of the Thousand Years; which living again of those some, is called the <hi>First Resurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Piscator</hi> has another Argument which is to this Purpose, <hi>They who after they live again shall be and reign with Christ,</hi> do rise in Respect of their Bodies. Now this is affirmed of the Subjects of the <hi>First Resurrection</hi>; They lived and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Christ, and they were Priests of God and of Christ, and reigned with him a Thousand Years. <hi>Piscator</hi> indeed supposes it to be a reigning with Christ in Heaven after the Resurrection: But the Saints in Heaven shall not reign for a Thousand Years, but on Earth they shall, it must therefore be meant of a Reign not in Heaven, but on Earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>As is the Death of those Reigning Saints, such will be their Resurrection:</hi> But their Death was of their Bodies: For it is said <hi>they were beheaded,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Natural Death. The <hi>Romans</hi> did usually, and the <hi>Iews</hi> often put Men to Death (as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was) by cutting off their Heads with a Sword. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho'
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001411_0022_0FB2F9F0644B6990"/>
it is said <hi>Souls</hi> that were beheaded, that does not in the least imply that the Death spoken of was a Spiritual Death peculiar to the Soul; for how can an immortal Soul be beheaded? But frequently in Scripture the <hi>Soul</hi> is put for the <hi>Person, Gen.</hi> 46.26. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.25. nay <hi>for the Body</hi>; As when it is said, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell. i. e.</hi> my Body in the Grave, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.10. The martyred <hi>sacrificed Bodies</hi> of the Saints, are said to be <hi>Souls slain,</hi> which cry for Vengeance, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.9. Dr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> observes well, <hi>their Resurrection to Life must be taken in the same Sense and Proportion to the Life they lost.</hi> Inasmuch then as the Natural Lives of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> were taken away, their Living implies a Resurrection of their Bodies, for their Souls to be re-united with and live in. The Argument stands thus, A Resurrection of the dead in Body is a Corporal Resurrection; but the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> is a Resurrection of the dead in Body; for it is a Resurrection of them that were beheaded.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>The</hi> First Resurrection <hi>spoken of in the</hi> Apocalypse <hi>is either a Spiritual, or a Political, or Corporal Resurrection:</hi> But neither of the former. It has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly been interpreted as meant of a Spiritual <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the Soul, in Respect of <hi>Regeneration</hi>; as if it were the same with what <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, Eph. 2.5. <hi>You hath he quickened who were dead in Trespasses and Sins.</hi> But if this were intended, how is it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aid, that <hi>they lived and reigned a thousand Years?</hi> Do all that are made Partakers of Regeneration live a Thousand Years? And how is it said that <hi>the rest of the dead lived not again until the Thousand Years were finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> There never was a Thousand Years in which there was no Conversion, or Spiritual Resurrection of Souls. Besides, a <hi>Death in Sin is not called the first Death,</hi> and consequently Conversion from a State of Sin is not properly called [the] first (supposing it be [a] first) <hi>Resurrection.</hi> The Spiritual Resurrection began presently after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, and shall continue to the End of the World; when as that which <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks of is proper to the Thousand Years, and not to begin before <hi>Antichrist</hi>'s Reign is ended. Yet again, how can it be said of Men that were beheaded, that they were converted after their beheading? Such Absurdities has this (tho' a vulgar) Exposition in it. This Notion is therefore rejected by most that have studied the <hi>Apocalypse:</hi> But there are many learned and judicious Authors who take the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> in a <hi>Political Sense,</hi> as if it were of the same Nature with the Resurrection of the Witnesses spoken of in the 11th of <hi>Revelation,</hi> and did intend only thus much, <hi>that when</hi> Antichrist <hi>is destroyed, the Church shall be delivered from the Death of Affliction, and continue in a glorious State for a Thousand Years before the ultimate Iudgment, during all which Time Men shall be ruled by the Laws of Christ, and only Saints shall have Power in their Hands.</hi> All this I freely acknowledge to be true and according to the Scriptures: But with all due Respect to these Expositors, I conceive that does not comprehend the full Meaning of the Text before us. For this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation does imply that the Saints of the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> suffered a <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Death</hi> only, like that of the <hi>Two Witnesses.</hi> Were that so, a <hi>Political Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi> would be intended by their living again. But (as has been shewn) their Death was more than Political, and therefore so must their Resurrection unto Life be. Again, this Interpretation implies that the beheaded Saints lived again in their <hi>Successors</hi> only, and <hi>not</hi> in <hi>their own Persons.</hi> When as in Strictness of Speech, a Resurrection is of the same individual Person rather than of a Successor. And certainly as they suffered in their own Persons, so they themselves in their own Persons, and not others for them, shall rise and reign, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. When Christ says to <hi>Overcomers,</hi> that they shall <hi>eat of the Tree of Life, have a new Name, have Power over the Nations,</hi> &amp;c. we may not suppose that he intends they shall have this Glory in their Successors: No more may we think they who have been beheaded for his Sake shall have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

given them for a Thousand Years in their Successors, but not in their own Persons.</p>
               <p>Yet further, it is said concerning the Saints of the <hi>First Resurrection,</hi> that <hi>they are blessed and holy, and that the Second Death shall have no Power over them.</hi> How does this agree to them that are the Subjects of only a Political Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? Will there be a Time when in the Church on Earth there shall be no Reprobate, nor any unregenerate Person for a Thousand Years together? So indeed it will be at the Day of Judgment: But before that Blessed Day it will not be, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.30. Nor does this <hi>Political Sense</hi> well agree with that Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the rest of the dead not living again until the Thousand Years were finished. Shall all the dead have a Political Resurrection at the End of the Thousand Years? They must have a Resurrection of the same Kind with that which some had at the Beginning of the Thousand Years. I have yet one Thing more to object here. This Political Resurrection does imply that the Lord's People shall enjoy great Prosperity, yea, <hi>and Dominion in this present World,</hi> and that for many Ages, when as the Scripture tells them of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and of an evil World, and that the Sufferings of the Church shall last throughout <hi>this present Time</hi>; yea, until the Day comes when the Creature shall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption, and we shall have the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18,—24. There is a Kingdom promised, but the Enjoyment of it not to be expected in this present, but <hi>in the World to come.</hi> In the <hi>Resurrection World</hi> we shall reign on Earth, but it must be made a <hi>New Earth,</hi> which it will not be before the Conflagration: The Fire of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Day will purifie and renovate the World. The Scripture is express, that the <hi>last Days</hi> of this present World will be <hi>perilous Times,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.1. It is not said <hi>some</hi> of the last Days will be so: Nor may we distinguish where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does not. But how then can we believe that the last Thousand Years of this World will be Times without any Peril? The <hi>New Heaven</hi> and <hi>the New Earth</hi> which God has promised, <hi>i. e. the New World</hi> which shall begin with the Resurrection, will be another kind of World than what this which we see is, and has been ever since the Fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> In <hi>that World</hi> they shall have Rest and Refreshing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.35. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19, 21. 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.7. In the mean Time they must bear the Cross, conflict with Enemies, and suffer Persecution, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.36. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. It remains then that the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> is Literal and Corporal.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Primitive and Orthodox Christianity was of this Mind.</hi> Indeed since <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianism</hi> has had the Ascendant, as many other glorious Truths, so the Doctrine of the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> and the Thousand Years Reign has been condemned for Heresie. <hi>Baronius</hi> calls it Heresie, but <hi>A Lapide</hi> is more modest. He saith the Millenary Opinion is <hi>an Error,</hi> but he dared not to call it Heresie, <hi>because it was never condemned by any Council.</hi> Some <hi>Lutherans</hi> have been as severe in their Censures as <hi>Baronius.</hi> There was a late <hi>Lutheran</hi> Minister, <hi>viz.

                  </gap> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not answer, and therefore must believe the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> to be Corporal, until I see a clear and solid Answer to them.</p>
               <p>Argum. 1. <hi>Because</hi> Daniel's <hi>Day of Iudgment, with the universal Kingdom, and</hi> John's <hi>Thousand Years are the same.</hi> I shall not spend Time to prove that the 7th Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi> speaks of Christ's Personal Coming to Judgment. It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful that any Men of Learning should deny it, and affirm that what is spoken in that Chapter is already accomplished. But was the <hi>Beast</hi> given <hi>to the burning Flame</hi> at Christ's first Personal Coming? Was the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> destroyed Four Hundred Years before he was born? Was <hi>the Dominion under the whole Heaven</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Saints of the most High at Christ's First Coming, who told his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples that they must expect Sufferings, and not Dominion in this World: Nor in the Interpretation of others to be admitted, which supposeth that <hi>Daniel</hi> speaks only of a <hi>Vertual Coming</hi> of Christ, <hi>by the Power and Presence of his Spirit.</hi> Such Expositions are dangerous, inasmuch as they have a Tendency to weaken the Faith of Men concerning a Fundamental Article in Religion. There is not a more pregnant and illustrious Place in all the <hi>Old Testament</hi> to prove Christ's Personal Coming to Judgment, than that in the 7th of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he shall come with <hi>a fiery Stream issuing before him, and ten thousand times ten thousand Angels waiting on him; i. e.</hi> when he shall be <hi>revealed from Heaven in flaming Fire with his mighty Angels,</hi> he will come to Judgment. Now this is that Coming of Christ to receive an <hi>universal Kingdom</hi> which <hi>Daniel</hi> speaks of. But <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Thousand Years</hi> is the same with this as appears; 1. In that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the same Time, <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the <hi>Beast</hi> is cast alive into the Lake of Fire, then does <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Thousand Years begin, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.20. and 20.4. If <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Day of Judgment and <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Thousand Years both begin with the total Ruin of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> as we see they do, then they are the same. 2. They have both the very same Description given to them, as we shall see if we compare them. <hi>Daniel</hi> saith, <hi>I beheld 'till the Thrones were pitched down.</hi> Our <hi>English</hi> Translation, which is <hi>until the Thrones mere cast down,</hi> is not according to the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Original. The Meaning is, that Thrones or Seats were placed for the Judges to sit upon. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors say, that one of these Thrones is for the King <hi>Messias</hi> to sit upon. There is mention made of more Thrones than one, because the Saints shall have the Honour to sit with Christ as <hi>Assesso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> in judging the World. Doubtless our Saviour had Respect to this Text in <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he said to the Apostles in Matth. 19.28. <hi>When the Son of Man shall sit upon the Throne of his Glory, ye shall also sit upon Twelve Thrones, judging the Twelve Tribes of Israel.</hi> Now whereas <hi>Daniel</hi> says, <hi>I beheld 'till the Thrones were pitched down, and the Iudgment (i. e.</hi> they that were to be Judges) <hi>sate: Iohn</hi> says, <hi>I saw Thrones, and they sate upon them. Daniel</hi> says, Ver. 22. <hi>And Iudgment (i. e.</hi> Power of judging) <hi>was given to the Saints of the most High: Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>And Iudgment was given to them. Daniel</hi> saith, <hi>And the Saints possessed the Kingdom</hi>; that is to say, with the Son of Man who came in the Clouds of Heaven: <hi>Iohn</hi> says, <hi>And they lived and reigned with Christ a Thousand Years.</hi> Who that well considers this can do otherwise than

think that <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Vision of the great Judgment and universal Kingdom of Christ with his Saints, and <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Vision of the Saints reigning with Christ a Thousand Years, are one and the same Thing. See Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s first Letter to Dr. <hi>Medus.</hi> Fol. 932.</p>
               <p>Argum. 2. <hi>If the Thousand Years are not past, but future, and if the Day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be here within less than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se Thousand Years, then undoubtedly the Day of Iudgment does begin with the</hi> Apocalyptical Chiliad: But both these are true.</p>
               <p>Many Learned Men have thought that the Thousand Years began either at the Birth or Death of our Saviour, or at the Destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or when <hi>Constantine</hi> the first Christian Emperor was enthroned. This last Opinion is followed by many that have wrote on the <hi>Apocalypse</hi>: But the Reign or Prosperity of Christians under <hi>Constantine</hi> continued not a Thousand, nor for more than Twenty or Thirty Years before unhappy Changes attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. From the Beginning to the End of the <hi>Millennium</hi> Satan is bound, which hitherto he has never been. If the Devil's Hands have been bound for a Thousand Years, how then has he been able to strike the Church with such cruel Persecutions? And as much since <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Time as before. Some say this <hi>Ligation</hi> of <hi>Satan</hi> does not imply his being kept from persecuting the Church, only from being able <hi>to deceive the Nations.</hi> But he has deceiv'd the Nations within these Thousand Years last past as much as ever since the World began. Has he not <hi>deceiv'd the Nations</hi> by his Prophet <hi>Mahomet?</hi> And has he not deceiv'd the Nations by <hi>Antichrist?</hi> It is strange that any Man should imagine that Satan has not deceiv'd the Nations since <hi>Antichrist</hi> came, when the Apostle says his <hi>coming is after the working of Satan, with lying Wonders, and with all deceivableness of Unrighteousness,</hi> 2 Thess. 2.9, 10. And if the Nations have not been deceived since <hi>Constantine,</hi> how is it said of the Beast, that <hi>he deceives them that dwell on the Earth,</hi> Revel. 13.14. It is said that <hi>after the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years are finished Satan must be loosed a little Season:</hi> But according to the mentioned Interpretations, the Thousand Years were expired Four Hundred Years ago, which is more than a <hi>little Season,</hi> compared with a Thousand Years. But why then is not <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> destroyed by Fire from Heaven, nor the ultimate Judgment here? which without doubt it will be within less than Four Hundred Years after the <hi>Millennium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Millennial Reign began a Thousand Years ago, then Christ's Reign on Earth and Antichrist's would be at the very same time, which cannot be. <hi>Non bené conveniunt nec in unâ sede morantur.</hi> There are others who think the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years are now current. <hi>Cotterius</hi> supposeth that they began in the Year 1517. Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> (a worthy Man) makes the <hi>Millennium</hi> to commence <hi>ab anno</hi> 1560. He imagines that the Twelve Hundred and Sixty Days were expired, and that the seventh Trumpet has been sounding ever since that. He thinks that this Notion of his <hi>will</hi> (as he Phraseth it) <hi>help to stay the Gadding Expectation of stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious things to come.</hi> The <hi>First Resurrection</hi> is with him the same with Conversion and Regeneration. He would not have us believe that Christ will ever be on the Earth again, no not at the Day of Judgment. I am apt to think that <hi>Iob</hi> and he had differing Sentiments as to that particular (see him on <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. p. 715, 727.) But since the Time he fixes upon, the Witnesses have been in Sackcloth, and slain also. What <hi>Massacres</hi> have there been since that?

So that they had been dead and in Hell during all the Thousand Years. I confess this was one of the first Arguments which did above Twenty Years since induce me to believe a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Resurrection at the beginning of the Thousand Years; I could never an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it, I saw clearly by what is spoken by <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> as well as by <hi>Iohn,</hi> in the Revelation, that at the Final Destruction of <hi>Antichrist</hi> there will be a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal Coming of Christ, and that the World will then be on a light Fire. And I saw that after this Perdition of the Man of Sin, there shall be a Glorious Reign of the Saints on Earth.</p>
               <p>If <hi>after the Total and Final Ruine of</hi> Antichrist, <hi>the Church of God shall have a Glorious time on Earth,</hi> before the Universal Judgment of all Mankind: And <hi>of the Final ruine of</hi> Antichrist <hi>is not to be expected before the coming of Christ in the Clouds of Heaven,</hi> all that we argue for must needs be granted; Both the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses does the Scripture clearly assert.</p>
               <p>Yet further to prove that Christ's next Personal Coming will be a long time before the Wicked shall rise, I argue thus.</p>

And Whereas it is said again, <hi>the Sea gave up the Dead which was in it,</hi> he says, <hi>the Sea</hi> notes <hi>Corrupt Doctrines,</hi> and that therefore the Words imply, <hi>that the Iews who live in</hi> Spain <hi>and</hi> Italy, <hi>and in other Popish Countries</hi> shall be called. But if Men allow themselves this Liberty of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorizing,</hi> we may at last Allegorize Religion into nothing but Fancy, and say that the Resurrection is past already.

               <p>THE Design of the former part of this <hi>Dissertation</hi> is to handle the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie under Debate (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) only in a defensive Way, and I have therefore but touched, and not enlarged on the Arguments that prove a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Conversion of the Israelitish Nation. In this last part, which concerns the <hi>first Resurrection,</hi> to begin with the <hi>Millennium,</hi> I once purposed to consider the Question (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and only by positive Reasons to confirm what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is Truth. But I perceive it will be needful to endeavour the Removal of some Objections which detain many sober Minds from the embracing of such a <hi>Paradox</hi> as that which we have been labouring to evince.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>It has been objected that</hi> Matth. 25. <hi>speaks of the Righteous and the Wicked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iudged together; the one being set on the Right hand and the other on the Left hand of Christ the Iudge.</hi> To which I answer,</p>
               <p>That it is evident that <hi>the Sentence of Absolution</hi> will be passed on the Righteous before the <hi>Sentence of Condemnation</hi> on the Wicked. When it is said, <hi>he shall set the Sheep on the Right hand, but the Goats on the Left,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the Sheep shall be acquitted, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It did consist of Seventy Elders besides the <hi>Nasi.</hi> i. e. the <hi>Prince or President of the Court.</hi> The most Aged or Venerable of the Judges was <hi>Vice-president,</hi> he was called <hi>Ab-beth-din,</hi> the Father of the House of Judgment. This helps to understand that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of <hi>the Ancient of Days</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Daniel.</hi> These Judges sate semi-circle wise: The <hi>Nasi,</hi> or <hi>President,</hi> in the midst of them, <hi>the Father of the Consistory,</hi> or <hi>Vice President,</hi> next to him on his Right Hand. This gives Light to the Expression of <hi>sitting on the right Hand of Power,</hi> Mark 14.62. There were Two Scribes belonging to this House of the great Judgment; the one of which <hi>sate on the Right Hand,</hi> he took the Votes for <hi>Absolution</hi>; the other on the <hi>Left Hand,</hi> who took the Votes for <hi>Condemnation.</hi> Unto this (I say) the 25th of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the 7th of <hi>Daniel</hi> have Respect. Now why may we not believe, that at the <hi>great Assize,</hi> when all Mankind shall be brought before the Judge, the Righteous shall have the Sentence of Absolution passed on them <hi>in the Morning</hi> of that great and long Day; but the Wicked receive their Sentence of Condemnation <hi>in the after Part, or Evening of the Day?</hi> And why may not the <hi>Mille Anni caelestis imperii,</hi> (as <hi>Lactantius</hi>'s Expression is,) why may not the Thousand Years Reign be the setting of the righteous at the <hi>Right Hand</hi> of him who is <hi>the Ancient of Days,</hi> the chief Judge to whom it belongs to pronounce the Sentence, and who will sentence to the Second Death all whose Names are not written in the Book

The <hi>Messiah</hi> his being to be born of a Virgin, and at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and that he was to come within so many Years, these Things were but once mentioned by the Prophets. That particular Resurrection which was at the Time of our Lord's Resurrection, is spoken of by only one of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists. Many Historical Passages in <hi>Luke</hi>'s Gospel are no where else mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that is Ground sufficient for our Faith to build upon. But as for the <hi>Thousand Years,</hi> they are mentioned <hi>no less than Six Times</hi> (sometime with, and sometime without an Article in the <hi>Greek</hi> Original) in one Chapter. I cannot think that the Holy Spirit by the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> would so inculcate, and insist upon it, if there were not a greater and a more glorious Mystery contain'd therein than the vulgar Interpretation does allow of. Moreover, it seems to me that another Apostle mentions the Thousand Years, as concurring with the Day of Judgment: For <hi>Peter</hi> calls <hi>the Day of Iudgment, the Day of God, and the Day of the Lord.</hi> He also says, that <hi>one Day is with the Lord as a Thousand Years, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It is a celebrated Saying among them when they speak of the Day of Judgment, <hi>that one Day of the Holy Blessed God, is a Thousand Years. Peter</hi> seems to say the same.

The <hi>Iews</hi> cannot endure to read the <hi>New Testament</hi>; nevertheless, some of them are affected with the <hi>Book of Revelation,</hi> for therein they find Mystical Numbers, such as 666, and 42 Months, Three Days and a half, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they are delighted with, and they are taken with <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Description of the <hi>New Ierusalem,</hi> and the Allusions which are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Book to Things which they are acquainted with is pleasing to them: And in particular, <hi>a Thousand Years glorious Reign with the Messiah, and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Resurrection of the Righteous, and before the Resurrection of the Wicked,</hi> is a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery which the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors have not been altogether unacquainted with; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving (no doubt) received that Notion, as well as that of the Day of Judgment, by Tradition from their Fathers, who had them from the Prophets.

They that would see more <hi>Rabbinical</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may find them in <hi>Grellot's Prodromus in Apoc cap.</hi> 20. I shall only add here, that it is no Heresie to believe that some Circumstances relating to the Day of Judgment were not revealed so fully before as since the Ascension of our Lord, who has taken the Book out of the Right Hand of him that sits on the Throne, and has made these Things known to <hi>Iohn,</hi> the last of the Apostles, so far as is needful, for the Edification and Consolation of his Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another Objection is <hi>that at the Day of Iudgment the Conflagration will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all the wicked on the Earth, and then how shall there be Enemies,</hi> viz. Gog <hi>and</hi> Magog <hi>to make an Attempt on the Camp of the Saints after the Thousand Years are expired?</hi> To this some have answered, that we may suppose that the <hi>Living Saints</hi> who shall be all changed at the Lord's Coming, will not be put into a State in respect of Immortality, <hi>equal with the Angels,</hi> as the Saints of the <hi>First Resurrection</hi> shall be; but the Change they shall undergo will make them like <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise; that they shall eat and drink and the like, as <hi>Adam</hi> should if he had not sinned; that these shall be <hi>instructed and ruled by the Saints of the New Ierusalem,</hi> who shall then be <hi>Priests and Kings.</hi> Thus <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Lib. 5. Cap. 35. and <hi>Lactantius</hi> Lib. 7. C. 24. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors are of Opinion, that in the Days of the <hi>Messiah</hi> Men shall live as long as the Patriarchs did before the Flood. They suppose the Meaning of that Text Isa. 65.20. <hi>The Child shall die an Hundred Years old,</hi> to be, that one who is but an Hundred Years old will be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Child, because of the great Longevity of Men in those Days. But the Scripture seems to intimate that the Saints <hi>found alive at the Lord's Coming</hi> shall in a Moment be made incorruptible, like those raised from the dead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50, 51, 52. Wherefore there is another Answer which seems to some (tho' for my own Part I am not so fully satisfy'd in that Notion of the Saints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made incorruptible at the Beginning of the Thousand Years) a clearer So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of what has been objected. It is this; the Scripture gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that there will be <hi>Two Conflagrations,</hi> as well as Two Resurrections, the first at the Beginning, and the last at the End of the Thousand Years. As for the first <hi>Conflagration,</hi> not only the Living Saints, but whole Nations besides shall escape that Destruction, out of which Nations will <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> arise. <hi>Lactantius</hi> says, that when the Thousand Years begin, tho' <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall be destroyed, yet that the Nations shall not be wholly extinguished, but <hi>Quadam relinquentur ut triumphantur à justis,</hi> &amp;c. Some will remain for the Righteous to reign over. And the Scripture speaks expresly of the <hi>Nations of them which are saved,</hi> Rev. 21.24. that is to say, who are saved from that Fire, which the <hi>Beast</hi> and <hi>False Prophet</hi> are cast alive into; who are saved from that Burning which shall be when the <hi>Beast</hi> is slain, and his Body given to the burning Flame.

When God's appointed Time is come for the Burning of the World, the Fire will doubtless begin in one Part of the Earth first, as it was when the World was drowned; and the Scripture does clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate that <hi>Italy</hi> will be the Place, for there the <hi>Beast</hi> has his Seat. Dr. <hi>Cressener</hi> (a late judicious Writer) inclines to think that after the burning of the Body of the <hi>Beast,</hi> there will remain a considerable Part of the Earth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and inhabited; that the Christian Church shall not only continue, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, after the particular Conflagration of the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories; because it is said, <hi>the rest of the Beasts had their Lives prolonged for a season,</hi> Dan 7.12.

He also supposeth that when that Part of the Earth shall continue in Flames, this partial Conflagration will be a Means of keeping Christians in a more strict Obedience, yea and of converting the Heathen Nations in all Parts of the World. Thus doth that learned and worthy Person conjecture. His Argument would be demonstrative, if it were certain that <hi>the Prolongati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> chuses to read the Word in the singular Number, <hi>the Remainder of the Beast,</hi> and then the Sense is, that not the <hi>Body</hi> only, or <hi>People of the Beast's Dominions</hi> were destroyed, but the <hi>Ten Horns</hi> and the <hi>wicked Horn</hi> (which are <hi>the Remainder of the Beast</hi>) had their Dominion taken away; yet the <hi>Prolongation of Life was given to them for a Season and Time, viz.</hi> until the Time when the Son of Man shall come in the Clouds of Heaven. But if we construe the Words plurally, and by the rest of the <hi>Beasts</hi> understand the Three First Monarchies, the Meaning may be, that they lost their Dominion after they had successively for a Time ruled the World: But then the <hi>Fourth Beast</hi> differed from them in this, that he was destroyed by Fire from Heaven, which they were not: So that this Text in <hi>Daniel</hi> does not necessitate us to believe that the <hi>Conflagration</hi> will be so <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,</hi> or that only the <hi>Western</hi> Part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire shall fall under it.</p>

Is it credible that during the Time of Iudgment, there can be Heart in any Creature to attempt such an Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against Christ and his Saints, as this of</hi> Magog <hi>is?</hi> As for the first part of the Objection, it is answered without any difficulty. How was <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> able to converse with the Angels who came to instruct them? How were three of the Disciples able to converse with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> when Christ was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in the Holy Mount, in which there was a Glimpse and Representation of this Glorious Kingdom, and of the Communion which shall then be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Saints Mortal and Immortal: As for the latter Part of the Objection, the Answer which Dr. <hi>Twiss</hi> gives is this, <hi>True, if</hi> Gog <hi>and</hi> Magog <hi>knew the Condition of</hi> New-Jerusalem <hi>so well as the Devil and his Angels know the Condition of Heaven.</hi> The Devil will deceive them, as he did our first Parents, and make them believe that they may without Danger follow his Suggestions. But if we suppose them to be acquainted with the Glory of the <hi>New-Ierusalem,</hi> which is only the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of the New World, the Camp of the Saints, upon whom the Attach does immediately fall, are in a less Glorious Estate. It will doubtless be a great Hardiness in <hi>Gog and Magog</hi> to engage in so desperate an Attempt: But how often have Sinners, when left to themselves, not acted like rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? Some have thought that the Apostate Angels did first Sin in Heaven; I am not of that Opinion, for Heaven is a Place that was never defiled, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. But for certain those Angels were once in Heaven, that was their first and proper Habitation. They saw the Infinite Power of God; they were

They could not but know that the Eternal Power was able to destroy them in a Moment; yet these mutable Beings left to themselves, begin a War against Heaven. Is it then impossible that <hi>Gog and Magog</hi> should do the like, when the Devil is in them?</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>William Alleine</hi> in his Discourse of <hi>the New-Heavens and New-Earth,</hi> p. 123. reasons well, that the Power of Sin is so great as that it will make Men hazard their Lives to fulfill their Lusts. The Officers who apprehended the Lord Jesus Christ, notwithstanding He did at that very Time discover his Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before their Eyes, were so hardned as to go on with their Design, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.6. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.51.

No doubt but the <hi>Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites</hi> did hear of this, and that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his Host were drowned in that Sea, yet they would venture to come and fight against <hi>the Camp of the Saints,</hi> tho' they knew God was among them. <hi>Balaam</hi> knew that God was with them, and that there was great rejoycing amongst the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> because they had Him as King in the midst of them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.21. He knew that <hi>Israel</hi> should <hi>Eat up the Nations, his Enemies.</hi> For all this he did them all the Mischief in his Power, and gave Devilish Advice to <hi>Balak</hi> tending to the ruin of That People. Is it then impossible that <hi>Magog</hi> should, by the Instigation of Satan, attempt a War against the Saints of God, tho' he should hear that Christ is amongst them and Reigning over them, and that the Name of that Glorious Church is, <hi>The Lord is there?</hi> The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> whilst in the Wilderness, Lived by Continual Miracles; the Pillar of Cloud by Day, and of Fire by Night, was a standing Miraculous Demonstration of the Presence of God.

Why then should it be thought impossible that <hi>God and Magog</hi> should <hi>compass about the Camp of the Saints, and the beloved City,</hi> with an ill Design, (which yet shall signifie no more than the Men of <hi>Sodon</hi> their besetting <hi>Lot</hi>'s House when the Angels were in it) supposing Risen and Immortal Men to be in the midst of them.</p>
               <p>As for that Opinion of <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Personal Presence and Residence in the midst of the</hi> New-Jerusalem, <hi>during the Thousand Years,</hi> I do not assert it. I believe He will <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear when the thousand Years begin:</hi> Yet I know not, but <hi>in that World to come,</hi> He may be <hi>seen ascending and descending at his Pleasure,</hi> all the Angels of Heaven wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Him. This <hi>great thing,</hi> this glorious Sight shall <hi>Nathanael,</hi> and all such <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> as he was, be blessed with, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.50.51. The Saints on Earth may have a glorious Vision of Christ in Heaven at the Right Hand of God, when Heaven shall be opened, and they shall have the same Sight that <hi>Stephen</hi> had <hi>Acts</hi> 7.55.56. We may not reject a Truth, which as to the Substance of it is revealed, because we are in the Dark as to many Circumstances attending it. The Patriarchs and Prophets had the first coming of Christ discovered to them. They knew that the Eternal Son of God should be Incarnate, and that he should die for the Salvation of Men; Nevertheless, many Circumstances attending that coming
