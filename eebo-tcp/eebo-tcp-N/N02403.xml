            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe <hi>Indian</hi> Affairs of this Province have appear'd to your Excellency of such Importance to the Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the People here, that you have carefully apply'd your Thoughts to them, in which I hope your Excellency will have such Success, that not only the present Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration shall enjoy the Benefit of your Care, but our latest Posterity likewise may
<pb n="II" facs="unknown:002849_0003_0FE6765236B4D648"/>
bless your Memory under their Happiness, the Foundation of which may be laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Excellency's Administration, if the People here, who's Interest is chiefly concern'd, do on their parts second your Endeavours, as their Duty requires, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards securing the Peace and advancing the Prosperity of their Country.</p>
            <p>The following Account of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> will show what Dangerous Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Indians</hi> have been, what Pains a Neighbouring Colony (who's Interest is Opposit to ours) has taken to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Affections from Us, and how dreadful the Consequences may be, if that Colony should succeed in their Designs, and therefore how much we ought to be on our Guard. If we only consider the Riches which a People, who have been and may again be our Enemies, receive from the <hi>Indian Trade</hi> (tho' we were under no apprehensions from the <hi>Indians</hi> themselves) it may be thought imprudent in Us to suffer such People to grow Rich and Powerful, while it is in our Power to prevent it, with much less Charge and
<pb n="III" facs="unknown:002849_0004_0FE6765798FABEB0"/>
Trouble than it is in theirs to accomplish their designs.</p>
            <p>These Considerations are sufficient to make the <hi>Indian Affairs</hi> deserve the most serious Thoughts of the Governor of <hi>New-York.</hi> But I know your Excellency's Views are not confin'd to the Interest of your own Country only.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Five Nations</hi> are a poor Barbarous People, under the <hi>darkest Ignorance,</hi> and yet a <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>noble Genius</hi> shines thro' these <hi>black Clouds.</hi> None of the greatest <hi>Roman Hero's</hi> have discovered a greater Love to their Country, or a greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Death than these <hi>Barbarians.</hi> have done, when <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> came in Competition: Indeed, I think our <hi>Indians</hi> have out-done the <hi>Romans</hi> in this particulars for some of the greatest <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> have Murder'd themselves to avoid Shame or Torments, <note place="bottom">This will appear by several Instances in the second Part of this History.</note> Whereas our <hi>Indians</hi> have refused to Dye meanly with the least Pain, when they thought their
<pb n="IV" facs="unknown:002849_0005_0FE67657C0A8A7C8"/>
Country's Hononr would be at stake, by it, but gave their Bodies willingly up to the most cruel Torments of their Enemies, to shew, that the <hi>Five Nations</hi> consisted of Men whose Courage and Resolution could not be shaken. They fully, however, these <hi>noble Vertues</hi> by that cruel Passion <hi>Revenge,</hi> which they think not only law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but Honourable to exert without Mercy on their Country's Enemies, and for this only they deserve the Name of <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what have we <hi>Christians</hi> done to make them better? Alas! we have reason to be ashamed, that these <hi>Infidels,</hi> by our Conversation and Neighbourhood, are become worse than they were before they knew us. Instead of <hi>Vertues</hi> we have only taught them <hi>Vices,</hi> that they were entirely free of before that time. The narrow Views of <hi>private Interest</hi> have occasioned this, and will occasion <hi>greater,</hi> even <hi>Publick Mischiefs,</hi> if the Governors of the People do not, like true Patriots, exert themselves, and put a stop to these growing Evils. If these Practices be
<pb n="V" facs="unknown:002849_0006_0FE6765A8C742BE0"/>
winked at, instead of <hi>faithful Friends</hi> that have Manfully fought our Battles for us, the <hi>Five Nations</hi> will become <hi>faithless Thieves</hi> and <hi>Robbers,</hi> and joyn with every Enemy that can give them the hopes of <hi>Plunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If care were taken to plant in them, and cultivate that general Benevolence to Mankind, which is the true Principle of <hi>Vertue,</hi> it would effectually eradicate those <hi>horrid Vices</hi> occasioned by their <hi>Unbounded Revenge;</hi> and then the <hi>Five Nations</hi> would no longer deserve the Name of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> but would become a People whose <hi>Friendship</hi> might add <hi>Honour</hi> to the <hi>British Nation,</hi> tho' they be now too generally despised.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> &amp; <hi>Romans,</hi> once as much <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> as our <hi>Indians</hi> now are, dei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ied the Hero's that first taught them the <hi>Vertues,</hi> from whence the Grandeur of those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Nations wholly proceeded; but a good Man will feel more real Satisfaction and Pleasure from the Sense of having any way forwarded the <hi>Civilizing</hi> of <hi>Barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nations,</hi> or of having <hi>Multiplied</hi> the

               <hi>Number of good Men,</hi> than from the fondest hopes of such <hi>extravagant Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Considerations, I believe, would make your Excellency think a <hi>good History of the Five Nations</hi> worthy of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. As to this, I only hope, that you will look on my offering the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Account, however meanly perform'd, to proceed from the Desire I have of making some Publick Profession of that Gratitude, which is so much the Duty of</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THough every one that is in the least acquainted with the Affairs of <hi>North-America,</hi> knows of what Consequence the <hi>Indians,</hi> commonly known to the People of <hi>New-York</hi> by the Name of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> are both in Peace and War, I know of no Accounts of them Published in <hi>English;</hi> but what are meer Translations of <hi>French</hi> Authors. This seems to throw some Reflection on the Inhabitants of this Province, as if we wanted Curiosity to enquire into our own Affairs, and that we were willing to rest satisfied with the Accounts the <hi>French</hi> give us of our own <hi>Indians,</hi> notwithstanding that the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Canada</hi> are always in a different Interest, and sometimes in open Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility with us. This Consideration, I hope, will justify my attempting to write an History of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> at this time; and my endeavouring to remove that Blame with which we may be charged; perhaps will at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one for many Faults which the want of Capacity may have occasioned.</p>
            <p>Having had the Perusal of the Minutes of the <hi>Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners for Indian Affairs,</hi> I have been enabled to collect many Materials for this History, which are not to be found any where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: And this Collection will, at least, be useful to any Person of more Capacity, who shall afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this Task. When a History of these Nations shall be well wrote, it will be of great use to all the <hi>British Colonies</hi> in <hi>North-America;</hi> for it may enable them to learn Experience at the Expence of others; and if I can contribute any thing to so good a Purpose, I shall not think my Labour lost.</p>
            <p>It will be necessary to Excuse two things in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Performance, which, I am afraid, will be found fault with by those that are the best Judges. The <hi>First</hi> is, My
<pb n="VIII" facs="unknown:002849_0009_0FE6765DB7D79FB0"/>
filling up so great part of the Work with the Adventures of small Parties, and sometimes with those of one single Man. The <hi>Second</hi> is, The inserting so many Speeches at length. I must confess, that I have done both these designedly.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>First,</hi> The History of <hi>Indians</hi> would be very lame without an Account of these Private Adventures; for their War-like Expeditions are almost always carried on by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing each other, and their whole Art of War consists in managing small Parties. The whole Country being one continued Forrest, gives great Advantages to these Sculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties, and has obliged the <hi>Christians</hi> to imitate the <hi>Indians</hi> in this Method of making War. I believ'd like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, that some would be curious to know the Manners and Customs of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in their Publick Treaties especially, who could not be satisfied without taking Notice of several <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Circumstances, and some things otherwise of no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. We are fond of searching into Remote Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, to know the Manners of our Earliest <hi>Progenitors:</hi> if I be not mistaken, the <hi>Indians</hi> are living Images of them.</p>
            <p>My Design in the <hi>Second</hi> was, That thereby the Genius of the <hi>Indians</hi> might better appear. An Historian may paint Mens Actions in lively Colours, or in faint Shades, as he likes best, and in both cases preserve a perfect Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: But it will be a difficult Task to show the Wit, and Judgment, and Art, and Simplicity, and Ignorance of the several Parties, managing a Treaty, in other Words than their own. As to my part, I thought my self uncapable of doing it, without depriving the judicious Observer of the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of discovering much of the <hi>Indian Genius,</hi> by my Contracting or Paraphrasing their Harrangues, and without committing often gross Mistakes. For, on these Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, a skillful Manager often talks Confusedly and Obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y with design; which if an Historian should endeavour to amend, the Reader would receive the History in a false Light.</p>

The Reader will find a great Difference between some of the Speeches made at <hi>Albany,</hi> and those taken from the <hi>French</hi> Authors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The first are genuine, and truly related, as delivered by the Sworn Interpreters, and where Truth only is required; a rough Stile with it, is preferable to Eloquence without it. But I must own, that <hi>I</hi> suspect ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Interpreters may not have done Justice to the <hi>Indian Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</hi> For, the <hi>Indians</hi> having but few words, and few complex Ideas, use many Metaphors in their Discourse, which interpreted by an hesitating Tongue, may appear mean, and strike our Imagination faintly, but under the Pen of a skilful Interpreter may strongly move our Passions by their lively Images. I have heard an Old <hi>Indian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> speak with much Vivacity and Elocution, so that the Speaker pleas'd and moved the Auditors with the manner of delivering his Discourse; which, however, as it came from the Interpreter, disappointed us in our Expectations. After the Speaker had employ'd a considerable time in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranguing with much Elocution, the Interpreter often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the whole by one single Sentence. I believe the Speaker in that time imbellished and coloured his Figures, that they might have their full force on the Imagination, while the Interpreter contented himself with the Sense, in as few words as it could be exprest.</p>
            <p>He that first writes the History of Matters which are not generally known, ought to avoid, as much as possible, to make the Evidence of the Truth depend entirely on his own Veracity and Judgment: For this reason I have often related several Transactions in the Words of the Registers. When this is once done, he that shall write afterwards need not act with so much Caution.</p>
            <p>The History of <hi>Indians</hi> well wrote, would give an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Amusement to many, every one might find something therein suited to his own Pallat; but even then, every Line would not please every Man; on the contrary, one with

praise what another condemns, and one desires to know what another thinks not worth the trouble of Reading: And therefore, I think, it is better to run the Risque of being sometimes Tedious, than to omit any thing that may be Useful.</p>
            <p>I have sometimes thought that the Histories wrote with all the Delicacy of a fine Romance, are like <hi>French</hi> Dishes, more agreeable to the Pallat than the Stomach, and less wholsom than more common and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>An Historian's Views must be various and extensive, and the History of different People and different Ages, requires different Rules, and often different Abilities to write it: I hope, therefore, the Reader will receive this first At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the kind, in this Country, with more than usually Favourable Allowances.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>New-York</hi> have been much more concern'd in the Transactions which followed the year 1688, than in those which preceeded that year. As it requires un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Courage and Resolution to engage willingly in the Wars of Cruel and Barbarous Enemies; I should be sorry to forget any that may deserve to be remembered by their Country with gratitude. The <hi>First Part</hi> of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story going abroad by it self, may give those that have any <hi>Memoirs</hi> of their Friends who have distinguished them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, an opportunity of Communicating them, and may thereby enable the Writer hereof to do some Justice to their Merit.</p>
            <p>They likewise that are better acquainted with the <hi>Indian Affairs</hi> may, perhaps, find some Mistakes in what is now Published, and may know some things which I know not, if they will be so kind as to Communicate them, I shall gladly Amend and Insert them in what is to follow.</p>

            <head>A Short VIEW OF THE Form of Government OF THE FIVE NATIONS.</head>
            <p>IT is necessary to know something of the <hi>Form of Government</hi> of the People whose History one reads. A few words will serve to give the Reader a general Notion of that of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> because it still remains under Original Simplicity, free from those complicated Contrivances which have become necessary to those Nations where Deceit and Cunning have increased as much as their Knowledge and Wisdom.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Five Nations</hi> (as their Name denotes) consist of so many. Tribes or Nations joyn'd together by a League or Confederacy, like the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> without any Superiority of any one over the other. This Union has continued so long that the <hi>Christians</hi> know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Original of it.</p>
            <p>They are known to the <hi>English</hi> under the
<pb n="XV" facs="unknown:002849_0016_0FE6766FA929BC28"/>
Names of <hi>Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onnondagas, Cayugas</hi> and <hi>Sennekas;</hi> but it is probable that this Union at first consisted only of three Nations, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the <hi>Mohawks, Onnondagas</hi> and <hi>Sennekas,</hi> and that the <hi>Oneydoes</hi> and <hi>Cayugas</hi> were afterwards adopted or received into this League; for the <hi>Oneydoes</hi> acknowledge the <hi>Mohawks</hi> to be their Fathers, as the <hi>Cayugas</hi> do the <hi>Sennekas</hi> to be theirs.</p>
            <p>Each of the Nations are distinguished into 3 Tribes or Families, who distinguish themselves by three different sorts of Arms or Ensigns, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> the <hi>Tortoise,</hi> the <hi>Bear</hi> &amp; the <hi>Wolfe.</hi> The Sachems of these Families, when they sign any Publick Papers, put the Mark or Ensign of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to it.</p>
            <p>Each Nation is an absolute Republick by its self, govern'd in all Publick Affairs of War and Peace by the <hi>Sachems</hi> or <hi>Old Men,</hi> whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Power is gain'd by and consists wholly in the Opinion the rest of the Nation have of their <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Imegrity.</hi> They never execute their Resolutions by Compulsion or Force upon any of their People. <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Esteem</hi> are their Principal Rewards, as <hi>Shame</hi> &amp; being <hi>Despised</hi> are their Punishments. They have certain Customs which they observe in their Publick Affairs with other Nations, and in their Private Affairs among themselves, which it is <hi>scandalous</hi> for any one not to observe,
<pb n="XVI" facs="unknown:002849_0017_0FE6766FCF2A04E0"/>
and draw after them publick or private <hi>Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> when they are broke.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Generals</hi> and <hi>Captains</hi> obtain their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority likewise by the general Opinion of their <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Conduct,</hi> and loose it by a <hi>Failure</hi> in those <hi>Vertues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Great Men,</hi> both <hi>Sachems</hi> and <hi>Captains,</hi> are generally poorer than the common People, for they affect to give away and distribute all the <hi>Presents</hi> or <hi>Plunder</hi> they get in their Treaties or War, so as to leave nothing to themselves. If they should once be suspected of <hi>Selfishness,</hi> they would grow mean in the Opinion of their Country-men, and would consequently loose their Authority.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Affairs of Great Consequence,</hi> which concern all the Nations, are Transacted in a <hi>General Meeting</hi> of the <hi>Sachems</hi> of every Nation. These Conventions are generally held at <hi>On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondaga,</hi> which is nearly in the Center of all the <hi>Five Nations.</hi> But they have fixed upon <hi>Albany</hi> to be the Place for their <hi>Solemn Treaties</hi> with the <hi>English Colonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Tuscaroras,</hi> since the War they had with the People of <hi>Carolina,</hi> fled to the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and are now incorporated with them, so that they now properly consist of <hi>Six Nations</hi> (tho' they still retain the old Name among the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish.</hi>) The <hi>Tuscaroras,</hi> since they came under the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="XVII" facs="unknown:002849_0018_0FE67671E54A6300"/>
well, and remain peaceable and quiet By which may be seen the advantage of using the <hi>Indians</hi> well; and, I believe, if they were still better used, (as there is room enough to do it) the <hi>Indians</hi> would be proportionably more Useful to us.</p>
            <p>As I am fond to think, that the present state of the <hi>Indian Nations</hi> exactly shows the <hi>most Ancient</hi> and <hi>Original Condition</hi> of almost every Nation; so I believe, here we may with more certainty see the <hi>Original Form of all Government,</hi> than in the most <hi>curious Speculations</hi> of the <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and that the <hi>Patriarchal,</hi> and other <hi>Schemes</hi> in <hi>Politicks</hi> are no better than <hi>Hypotheses</hi> in <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,</hi> and as prejudicial to real Knowledge.</p>
            <p>I shall only add the Character which Mons. <hi>De la Poterie</hi> gives of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> in his History of <hi>North-America,</hi> 
               <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>When one talks <hi>(says he)</hi> of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> they are thought, by a common Mistake, to be meer <hi>Barbarians,</hi> always thirsting after <hi>Human Blood;</hi> but their true Character is very different: They are the <hi>Fiercest</hi> and <hi>most Formidable People</hi> in <hi>North America,</hi> and at the same time as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick</hi> and <hi>Judicious</hi> as well can be conceiv'd. This appears from their Management of the Affairs which they Transact, not only with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> but likewise with almost all the <hi>Indian Nations</hi> of this vast Continent.</q>

The <hi>Adiron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacks</hi> valued themselves, and their manner of living, as more Noble than that of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and despised them for that reason.</p>
                  <p>At last the Game began to be scarce with the <hi>Adirondacks,</hi> they therefore desired that some of the young Men of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> might joyn with them, and assist them in their Hunting, which the <hi>Five Nations</hi> the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002849_0022_0FE67679C46749F0"/>
agreed to, in hopes that thereby their People might acquire skill in Hunting.</p>
                  <p>It has been a constant Custom among all the Nations of <hi>Indians,</hi> to divide themselves into small Companies while they Hunt, and to divide likewise the Country among their several Parties, each having a space of 3 or four Miles Square alloted them, in which none of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers must pretend to Hunt; and if any Nation should encroach upon the Limits of another, in their hunting, they certainly draw a War upon themselves.</p>
                  <p>At this time the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> were obliged to spread themselves far, because of the scarcity of the Game, and each Party took some of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> along with them, who being less expert than the <hi>Adirondacks,</hi> perform'd most of the Drudgery in their March. One of the Parties, which consisted of six <hi>Adirondacks,</hi> and as many of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> marched further than any of the rest, in hopes of the better Sport: They had, for a long time bad luck, so as to be obliged to live upon the Bark of Trees, and some Roots, which those of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> scraped out of the ground, from under the Snow. This extremity obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> to part from those of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> each making a seperate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and after they had agreed on a Day to return to a Cabbin where both of them left
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002849_0023_0FE67679EBF985C8"/>
their Baggage, each took his Quarter to hunt in: The <hi>Adirondacks</hi> were unlucky, and return'd first to the Cabbin, where not finding those of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> they did not doubt of their being dead of Hunger; but these young Men of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> were become dex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Adirondacks</hi> could not believe that they were capable of such an Expedition, without being assisted by some of their Nations. However, the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> received them with pleasant Countenances, and congratulated them on their Success. Those of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> made the other a Present of the best of their Venison: They eat together with much Civility, on both sides: But the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> becoming Jealous of this Success, conspired together, and in the Night time murdered all the six Men of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> while they slept. Next Morning the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> follow'd their Foot-steps, by which they had return'd to the Cabbin, and found the place where they had hunted, and much Venison which they had killed, which the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> dryed, and carried home along with them.</p>

But the People of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> being impatient to know something certain of their Companions, sent out several Parties in quest of them: They followed the Foot-steps of those Hunters, and found the six Dead Bodies, which the wild Beasts had dug up; and upon Examination found they had been Murdered. They made many Complaints to the Chiefs of the <hi>Adirondacks,</hi> of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity of this Murder, who contented themselves with blaming the Murderers, and ordering them to make some small Presents to the Relations of the murdered Persons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being apprehensive of the Resentment of the <hi>Five Nations;</hi> for they look'd upon them as men not capable of taking any Revenge.</p>
                  <p>Those of the <hi>Five Nations</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002849_0025_0FE67681A932C4A8"/>
to their Law, by force of Arms. The <hi>Five Nations</hi> apprehending their Power, retired to the Southward of <hi>Cadarackui Lake,</hi> where they now live, and defended themselves at first but faintly against the Vigorous Attack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the <hi>Adirondacks.</hi> But afterwards becoming more expert, and more used to War, they no only made a brave Defence, but likewise made themselves Masters of the great Lakes, and chased the <hi>Shawanons</hi> from thence.</p>
                  <p>While the two Nations were at War, the <hi>French</hi> arrived and settled in <hi>Canada,</hi> and the <hi>Five Nations</hi> having forced the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> to leave their own Country and retire towards <hi>Quebeck,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> thought themselves obliged to assist their New Allies, the <hi>Adirondacks,</hi> without examining into the Reasons of the War.</p>
                  <p>Thus began a War and Hatred between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> which cost the <hi>French</hi> much Blood, and more than once had like to have occasioned the entire Destruction of their Colony. The War had driven the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> to <hi>Quebec,</hi> and the desire of Trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>French,</hi> had drawn likewise all their Allies that way, who agreed with them joyntly, to make War against the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and to attack them in their <hi>own Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Champlain</hi> desiring to give his Allies Proof of his Love, and the Valour of the

                     <hi>French Nation,</hi> put himself at the Head of a Body of <hi>Adirondacks,</hi> and passed with them into <hi>Corlars Lake,</hi> which from this time the <hi>French</hi> have called by Mr. <hi>Champlain'</hi>s name.</p>
                  <p>They had not long been in the Lake before they discover'd a Body of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> going to War. As soon as they saw each other, Shouts and Crys began on both Sides. Mr. <hi>Champlain</hi> made his men keep their Canoes at some distance; The <hi>Five Nations</hi> in the mean time landed, and began to intrench themselves, by cutting down the Trees round them; The <hi>Adirondacks</hi> stopt their Canoes near the Enemy, &amp; sent to offer them Battel, who answer'd, <hi>That they must stay till Morning, when both sides would have the Advantage of the Day Light:</hi> The night passed in Dancing and War <hi>S</hi>ongs, mixed with a thousand Reproaches against each other. Mr. <hi>Champlain</hi> had put some <hi>French</hi> in each Canoe, and order'd them not to show themselves, that their appearance might be the greater surprize to the Enemy, in the time of the Battel. As soon as day light appeared, the <hi>Adirondacks</hi>

                     </gap>lumes of Feathers on their Heads, and then advanced with a grave Air and slow Pace. The <hi>Adirondacks</hi> gave a great Shout and open'd
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002849_0027_0FE6768311C5A6F0"/>
to the Right and Left, to give room for Mr. <hi>Champlain</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> to advance: This new Sight surprized the Enemy, and made them halt, to consider it, upon which the <hi>French</hi> firing, the three Captains were kill'd: This more surpriz'd the <hi>Five Nations;</hi> for they knew that their Captains had a kind of Cuirass made of pieces of Wood join'd together, that was Proof against Arrows, and they could not perceive in what manner the Wound was given by which they fell so suddenly. Then the <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondacks</hi> gave a terrible Shout, and attacked the Enemy, who received them bravely, but a second Volley from the <hi>French,</hi> put them into such Confusion (having never before seen fire Arms) that they immediately fled. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dirondacks</hi> took twelve Prisoners, and as the Custom of the Indians is, burnt one of them alive, with great Cruelty; His Torment had continued much longer than it did, if Mr. <hi>Champlain</hi> had not in Compassion, &amp; abhorrence of such Barbarity, Shot the poor Wreth thro' the Head.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Adirondacks</hi> having their Numbers thus very much encreased, and their fire Arms giving them new Confidence, proposed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less to themselves, than the entire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> by open Force; And upon this their Young Warriors became Fierce and Insolent, and could not be kept

under any Discipline, Order or Subjection to their Chiefs or Captains, but upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions rashly attacked the Enemy, who were oblig'd to keep themselves upon the Defensive, and to make up what they wanted in Force, by Stratagems, and a skillful management of the War. The Young Men of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> soon perceived the Advantages they gain'd by this Conduct, and every day grew more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive to their Captains, and diligent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting any Enterprize, while the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> confiding in their Numbers and their fire Arms, thought of nothing but of Conquering by meer Force.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Five Nations</hi> sent out small Parties only, who meeting with great Numbers of the <hi>Adi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rondacks,</hi> retired before them, with seeming Fear and Terror, while the <hi>Adirondacks</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them with Fury, and without thought, till they were cunningly drawn into Ambu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus the most War-like and Polite Nation of all the <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>North-America</hi> was almost entirely Destroy'd by a People they at first despised, and by a War which their Pride and Injustice brought upon them. <hi>Immorality</hi> has ever ruin'd the Nations where it abounded, whether they were Civilized or Barbarians, as Justice and strict Discipline has made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Flourish and grow Powerful.</p>
                  <p>A very few <hi>Adirondacks</hi> now remain in some Villages near <hi>Quebeck,</hi> who still waste away and decay, by their drinking Strong Waters, tho' when the <hi>French</hi> first settled <hi>Quebeck,</hi> 1500 Men of them lived between that and <hi>Silleri,</hi> which are only a League distant, besides those that lived at <hi>Saguenay, Trots Rivieres,</hi> and some other places.

                  <head>Their Wars and Treaties of Peace with the French from 1665. to 1683. and their Affairs with New-York in that Time.</head>
                  <p>IN <hi>june,</hi> 1665, Mons. <hi>de Trasi</hi> being Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Vice-Roy of <hi>America,</hi> arrived at <hi>Quebeck,</hi> after he had visited all the Islands in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> and brought with him four Companies of Foot. In <hi>September</hi> of the same year Mr. <hi>Coursel</hi> arrived with the Commission of Governor General of <hi>Canada,</hi> with eleven Vessels, which transported a Regiment, and several Families, with all things necessary for the establishing of a Colony. The <hi>French</hi> Force being thus so considerably augmented, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in the Winter to send out a Party against the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> which by the Cold, and their not knowing the use of Snow-Shoes, suffered very much, without doing any thing against the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>This Party fell in with <hi>Schenectady,</hi> a small Town which <hi>Corlaer</hi> (a considerable Man among the <hi>Dutch</hi>) had then newly settled. When they appear'd near <hi>Schenectady</hi> they were almost kill'd with Cold and Hunger, and the <hi>Indians,</hi> who then were in that Village,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002849_0042_0FE676A618914A98"/>
had entirely finished their Ruin, if <hi>Corlaer,</hi> in Compassion of fellow <hi>Christians</hi>) had not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ontriv'd their escape. He had a mighty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence over the <hi>Indians,</hi> and it is from him that all the Governors of <hi>New-York</hi> are call'd <hi>Corlaer</hi> by the Indians to this Day, tho' he himself never was Governor. He perswaded the Indians that this was but a small Party of the <hi>French</hi> Army, come to amuse them, that the great Body was gone directly towards their Castles, and that it was necessary for them immediately to go in Defence of their Wives and Children: which they did. As soon as the Indians were gone, he sent to the <hi>French,</hi> and supply'd them with Provisions to carry them back. The <hi>French</hi> Governor, in order to Reward so signal a Service, invited <hi>Corlaer</hi> to <hi>Canada,</hi> and, no doubt, with design to make use of his Interest with the Indians in some Project, in favour of the <hi>French</hi> Colony; but as he went through the Lake (by the French call'd <hi>Champlain</hi>) his Canoe was Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>There is a Rock in this Lake, on which he Waves dash and fly up to a very great height, when the Wind bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002849_0043_0FE676A641827D68"/>
and therefore as they pass this Rock in their Voyages through this Lake, they always throw a <hi>Pipe</hi> or some <hi>Tobacco,</hi> or something else to this Old <hi>Indian,</hi> and pray a favourable Wind. The <hi>English</hi> that often pass with them, sometimes laugh at them; but they are sure to be told of <hi>Corlaers Death</hi> with a grave air. <hi>Your great Country-man</hi> Corlaer (say they) <hi>as he passed by this Rock, jested at our Fathers making Presents to this Old</hi> Indian, <hi>and in derision turn'd up his Back-side towards the Rock, but this Affron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But the next Spring the Vice-Roy and the Governor, with 28 Companies of Foot, and all the Inhabitants of the Colony, marched into the Country of the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to destroy this Nation, which by the War not only prevented their Commerce with other Indians, but even prevented the Settlement of the Colony. This certainly was a bold At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to march thus above 250 Leagues from <hi>Quebeck,</hi> through unknown Forre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This Expedition. however, gave the <hi>Five Nations</hi> Apprehensions they had not before; for they never before that saw so great a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Europeans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Designs met with Obstruction, and had not so considerable Success, by reason of the War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as otherwise they might have had; for in the Year 1674. <hi>New-York</hi> being Surpriz'd by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and Restor'd, the alterations in Government and of Masters, obstructed very much the designs of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Indians.</hi> Their Trade was likewise considerably hindred by the War, which the <hi>Five Nations</hi> had with the <note n="(c)" place="bottom">The <hi>Indians</hi> living on the Banks of <hi>Hudsons River,</hi> within or near the <hi>English</hi> Settlements.</note>

discovering new Countries, and every where spreading the Fame of the <hi>French</hi> Name and Grandeur, by making themselves the Arbitrators in all difference between the <hi>Indian Nations.</hi> The Sieur <hi>Perot</hi> deserves to be remember'd, who pushed his Discoveries as far as the <hi>Putewatemies</hi> and Indians living round the farther Lakes, with the greatest Fatigues and Danger. He acquired the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages of many Nations, and brought them to <hi>Canada</hi> to Trade, before the Peace was made with the <hi>Five Nations.</hi> In the Year 1667 he accomparied the Officer that was sent to the Fall of <hi>St. Mary,</hi> to take Possession of all that Country, in the name of the <hi>French King,</hi> in the presence of many of the Sachems of the Nations that liv'd round the Lakes, where there was an Alliance agree'd to with the <hi>French,</hi> but (ev'n by the <hi>French</hi> Books) no Subjection was Promised.</p>

                     <p>We likewise make known to our Father <hi>Corlaer,</hi> That in our Fury and Anger (after the People of the South had fallen upon us) We took these six Prisoners, and afterwards four Scalps were brought by our People, and no more.</p>
                     <p>We speak as <hi>Oneydoes,</hi> for our selves. If the <hi>Susquehana</hi> or <hi>Delaware</hi> Indians have done any Mischief, let not that be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us.</p>
                     <p>Eight of our People are now out against the <hi>Christians,</hi> of which we told <hi>Aernout</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> when they were at our Castle.

                              <head>Propositions made by the Right Honourable Francis Lord Howard of Effingham, Governor Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of His Majesty's Dominion of Virginia, To the Mohawks, Oneydoes, Onnonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas and Cayugas.</head>
                              <p>IT is now about seven years ago since you (unprovok'd) came into <hi>Virginia,</hi> a Country belonging to the Great King of <hi>England,</hi> and committed several Murders and Robberys, carrying away our <hi>Christian</hi> Women and Children Prisoners into your Castles. All which Injurys we designed to have Revenged on you; but at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Sir <hi>Edmond Andross,</hi> then Governor General of this Country, we desisted from destroying you, and sent our Agents Col. <hi>William Kendall</hi> and Col. <hi>Southley Littleton,</hi> to Confirm and make sure the Peace that Col. <hi>Coursey</hi> of <hi>Maryland</hi> included us in, when first he Treated with you. We find, that as you quickly forgot what you promised Col. <hi>Coursey,</hi> so you have willfully broke the Covenant Chain, which you promised our Agent, Col. <hi>Kendall,</hi> should be most strong and bright, if we of <hi>Virginia,</hi> would bury in the Pit of Oblivion, the Injurys you had then done us, which upon your Governor <hi>Andross'</hi>s Intercession, and your
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002849_0070_0FE676E375E5C678"/>
Submission, we were willing to forget; But you not at all minding the Covenant then made, have every year since, come into our Country, in a War-like manner, under pretence of Fighting with our <hi>Indians,</hi> our Friends and Neighbours, which you ought not to have done, our Agent having enclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them likewise in the Peace. You not only destroyed and took many of them Prisoners, but you have also kill'd and burnt our <hi>Christian People,</hi> destroying our Corn and Tobacco, more than you made use of, killing our Horses, Hogs and Cattle, not to eat, but let them ly in the Woods and stink. This you did, when you were not denyed any thing you said you want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                              <p>I must also tell you, that under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Friendship, you have come to our Houses at the heads of our Rivers (where they have been fortified) with a white Sheet on a Pole, and have laid down your Guns before the Fort, upon which our People taking you to be Friends, have admitted your great Men into their Forts, and have given them Meat and Drink, what they desired. After the great Men had refreshed themselves, and desiring to return, as they were let out of the Fort Gates, the young Men rushed into the Fort and plunder'd the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002849_0071_0FE676E39E961400"/>
House, taking away and destroying all the Corn, Tobacco, Bedding, and what else was in the House. When they went away, they took several Sheep with them, and kill'd several Cows big with Calf, and left them behind them, cut to pieces and flung about, as if it were in Defiance of the Peace, and destroying of our Friendship.</p>
                              <p>These, and many more Injurys that you have done us, have caused me to raise Forces, to send to the heads of our Rivers to defend our People from your Outrages, till I came to <hi>New-York</hi> to Col. <hi>Thomas Dongan,</hi> your Governor General, to desire him, as we are all one Kings Subjects, to assist me in Warring against you, to Revenge the <hi>Christian</hi> Blood that you have shed, and to make you give full Satisfaction for all the goods that you destroyed. But by the Mediation of your Governor, I am now come to <hi>Albany</hi> to speak with you; and to know the reason of your breaking the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Chain, not only with us and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>Indians</hi> but with <hi>Maryland,</hi> who are great King <hi>Charles'</hi>s Subjects; for our <hi>Indians</hi> have giv'n great King <hi>Charles</hi> their Land. Therefore I, the Governor of <hi>Virginia,</hi> will protect them, as your Governor under the Great <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Albany;</hi> will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth you, when the Chain of Friendship is made between us all.</p>
                              <p>

Now that I have let you know that I am sensible of all the Injurys that you have done us, by the desire of your noble Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor General, I am willing to make a new Chain with you for <hi>Virginia, Maryland,</hi> and our <hi>Indians,</hi> that may be more strong and lasting, even to the World's end, so that we may all be Bretheren and Great King <hi>Charles'</hi>s Children.</p>
                              <p>I propose to you, <hi>First,</hi> That you call out of our Countrys of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> all your young Men or Soldiers that are now there.</p>
                              <p>

                              <p>
                                 <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Tho' the Damages you have done our Country be very great, and would require a great deal of Satisfaction, which you are bound to give, yet we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you, that only by the Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>For the better Confirmation of the same and that the Peace now concluded, may be lasting, I propose to have two <note n="(m)" place="bottom">All Indians make use of the Hatchet or Ax as an Emblem to express War.</note> Hatchets buried as a final Determination of all Wars and Jarrings between us: One on behalf of us and our <hi>Indians,</hi> and the other for all your Nations united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that ever did us any Injury, or pretended to War against our <hi>Indian</hi> Friends or <hi>Maryland.</hi>

                              <p>And that nothing may be wanting for Confirmation thereof, (if you desire it) we are willing to send some of our <hi>Indian</hi> Sachems with an Agent next Summer, about this time, that they may Ratifie the Covenant with you here in this prefixed House, where you may see and speak to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as Friends.</p>
                              <p>That the Covenant now made between us in this prefixed House, in the presence of your Governor, may be firmly kept and perform'd on your parts, as it always has on ours, and that you do not break any one Link of the Covenant Chain for the future, by your Peoples coming near our Plantations; When you march to the

Southward, keep to the feet of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and not come nigh the heads, of our Rivers, there being no Bever Hunting there; for we shall not for the future (tho' you lay down your Arms as Friends) ever trust you more, you have so often deceiv'd us.</p>

                  <p>The next Day the <hi> Mohawks </hi> answered first by their Speaker, saying,</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>(Then turning to the other three Nations) <q>You have heard Yesterday all that has been said; as for our parts, we are free of the blame laid on us for the Mischief done in <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi> You are Stupid, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, and have no Understanding, thus to break your Covenant.

from an <hi>English</hi> Mans House, and four <hi>Indian</hi> Boys Prisoners.</p>
                  <p>They excused this, by its being done by the Parties that were out when the Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, who knew nothing of it; Which Accidents they had provided against in their Articles.

                  <p>So that we may still observe the Influence which the <hi>French Priests</hi> had obtain'd over those other Nations, and to what Christian-like Purposes they us'd it.</p>

The Bevers are the most valuable part of the <hi>Indian</hi> Trade.

                  <p>The <hi>Putewatemies, Malhominies</hi> and <hi>Puans</hi> offer'd themselves willingly, and went to the Rendevouze at <hi>Missilimainak,</hi> where they were receiv'd by the <hi>Utawawas</hi> with all the Marks of Honour usually paid to Soldiers, tho' the <hi>Utawawas</hi> had no inclination to the present Enterprize; they could not tell, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, how to appear against it, otherwise than by inventing what Delays they could to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their Marching.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while, a Cannoe arriv'd, which was sent by Mr. <hi>De Nonville</hi> with his Orders to the Officers.

                  <p>The <hi>English</hi> brought great Quantities of Rum with them, (which the <hi>Indians</hi> love more than their Life) and the <hi>French</hi> being afraid that if the <hi>Indians</hi> took to drinking, they would grow ungovernable, did what they could to keep them from it.

to make us Slaves, and that we should make our selves the Tools to effect it.

                  <p>The Messenger having assured the General, that it was time to depart, in order to meet the Western <hi>Indians,</hi> that came to his Assistance, he set out the 23d of <hi>June,</hi> and sent one part of his Army in Canoes, along the North Shoar, while he with the other part passed along the South, that no accidents of wind

might prevent the one or the other reaching within the time appointed at the Place the <hi>Indians</hi> were to meet him. It happened, by reason of the good weather that both the Parties arrived on the same day, and joyned the Western <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Irondequat.</hi> As soon as the men were put on shoar, they hawled up the Canoes, and began a Fort, where 400 Men were left to guard the Canoes, and the Baggage. Here a young <hi>Canadien</hi> was shot to death, as a Deserter, for conducting the <hi>English</hi> into the Lakes, tho' the two Nations were not only at Peace, but their Kings in stricter Friendship than usual. But this Piece of severity is not to be wonder'd at, when the <hi>French</hi> were resolved to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take an unjust War, and every thing to put a stop to the <hi>English</hi> Trade, which now began to extend it self far into the Continent, and would in its consequence ruin theirs.

the Village, but when he came there, he found the <hi>Sennekas</hi> had saved him the trouble; for they had laid all in Ashes before they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired; Two Old Men only were found in the Castle, who were cut into Pieces and boyled to make Soop for the <hi>French</hi> Allies. The <hi>French</hi> slaid five or six Days to destroy their Corn, and then marched to two other Villages, at two or three Leagues distance. After they had perform'd the like Exploits in those Places they return'd to the Banks of the Lake.</p>
                  <p>Before the <hi>French</hi> left the Lakes, they built a Fort of four Bastions at <hi>Oniagara,</hi> on the South side of the Streights, between <hi>Ohswego Lake</hi> and <hi>Cadarackui Lake,</hi> and left a hundred Men, with eight Months Provisions in it.

                  <p>The <hi>Western Indians</hi> when they parted from the <hi>French</hi> General, made their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues, as usual, in which they told him with what Pleasure they saw a Fort so well placed to favour their Designs against the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and that they Relied on his never Finishing the War but with the Destruction of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> or Force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to abandon their Country.

                     <p>I am now about sending a Gentleman to <hi>England,</hi> to the King, my Master, to let him know, that the <hi>French</hi> have invaded his Territories on this side the great Lake, and War'd upon the Brethren, his Subjects. I would therefore willingly know, whether the Brethren have giver the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> any Provocation or not; and if they have, how, and in what manner, because I am oblig'd to give a true account of this matter. This business may cause a War between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and here, and therefore I must know the Truth.</p>
                     <p>I know the Governor of <hi>Canada</hi> dare not enter into the great King of <hi>England's</hi> Territories, in a Hostile manner, without Provocation, if he thought the Brethren were the King of <hi>England'</hi>s Subjects; But you having two or three years ago, made a
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:002849_0114_0FE67737CB4A6950"/>
Covenant Chain with the <hi>French,</hi> contrary to my Command, (which I knew could not hold long) being void of it self among the <hi>Christians;</hi> for as much as Subjects (as you are) ought not to treat with any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nation, it not lying in your Power, have brought this Trouble upon your selves, and, as I believe, is the only reason of their falling upon you at this time.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brethren,</hi> I took it very ill, that after you had put your selves into the Number of the great King of <hi>England'</hi>s Subjects, that you should ever offer to make Peace or War without my consent. You know that we can live without you, but you cannot live without us. You never found that I told you a Lie, and I did offer your Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as you wanted, provided that you would be advised by me; for I know the <hi>French</hi> better than any of you do.</p>
                     <p>Now since there is a War begun upon you by the Governor of <hi>Canada,</hi> I hope without any Provocation by you given, I desire and command you, that you hearken to no Treaty but by my Advice, which if you follow, you shall have the Benefit of the great Chain of Friendship between the great King of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, which came out of <hi>England</hi> the other day, and which I have sent to <hi>Canada</hi> by <hi>Anthony

                           </gap>unard;</hi> In the mean time I will give you such Advice as will be for your good, and will supply you with such Necessarys as you will have need of.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> My Advice is, that as many Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners of the <hi>French,</hi> as you shall take, that you draw not their Blood, but bring them home and keep them to Exchange for your People, which they have Prisoners already or may take hereafter.</p>
                     <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> That if it be Possible, that you can order it so, I would have you take one or two of your wisest Sachems, and one or two chief Captains of each Nation, to be a Council to manage all Affairs of the War. They to give Orders to the rest of the Officers what they are to do, that your designs may be kept Private, for after it comes among so many People, it is Blazed abroad, and your designs are often frustrated. And those chief Men to keep a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with me, by a Trusty Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>3<hi>dly,</hi> Now the Great matter under Consideration with the Brethren, is, how to strengthen themselves, and weaken your Enemy. My Opinion is, that the Brethren should send Messengers to the <hi>Utawawas, Twihtwichs,</hi> and the farther <hi>Indians,</hi> and to send back likewise some of the Prisoners of
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:002849_0116_0FE6773C8A6AFE00"/>
these Nations, if any you have left, to bury the Hatchet, and to make a Covenant Chain, that they may put away all the <hi>French</hi> that are among them, and that you will open a Path for them this way, They being the King of <hi>England'</hi>s Subjects like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, only the <hi>French</hi> have been admitted to Trade with them, for all that the <hi>French</hi> have in <hi>Canada</hi> they had it of the Great King of <hi>England,</hi> that by that Means they may come hither freely where they may have every thing Cheaper than among the <hi>French.</hi> That you and they may joyn together against the <hi>French,</hi> and make so firm a League that whoever is an Enemy to one, must be to both.</p>
                     <p>4<hi>thly,</hi> Another thing of Concern is, that you ought to do what you can to open a Path for all the <hi>North Indians</hi> and <hi>Mahikanders</hi> that are among the <hi>Utawawas</hi> and farther Nations: I will endeavour to do the same, to bring them home; for they not daring to return home your way, the <hi>French</hi> keep them there on purpose to joyn with the farther Nations against you, for your Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for you know, that one of them is worse than six of the others. Therefore all means must be used to bring them Home, and use them kindly as they pass through your Country.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="108" facs="unknown:002849_0117_0FE6773CAC3594C8"/>
5<hi>thly,</hi> My Advice further is, That Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers go in behalf of all the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> to the <hi>Christian Indians</hi> at <hi>Canada,</hi> to perswade them to come Home to their Native Country, and to promise them all Protection. This will be another great means to weaken your Enemy; but if they will not be advised, you know what to do with them.</p>
                     <p>6<hi>thly,</hi> I think it very necessary for the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ethrens Security and Assistance, and to the endamaging the <hi>French,</hi> to build a Fort upon the Lake, where I may keep Stores and Provisions, in case of necessity; and therefore I would have the Brethren let me know what Place will be most convenient for it.</p>
                     <p>7<hi>thly,</hi> I would not have the Brethren keep their Corn in their Castles, as I hear the <hi>Onnondagas</hi> do, but to bury it a great way in the Woods, where few People may know where it is, for fear of such an Accident as has happen'd to the <hi>Sennekas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>8<hi>thly,</hi> I have given my Advice in your General Assembly by Mr. <hi>Dirk Wessels</hi> and <hi>Akus;</hi> the Interpreter, how you are to manage your Partys, and how necessary it is to get Prisoners, to exchange for your own Men that are Prisoners with the <hi>French.</hi> And I am glad to hear that the Brethren are so United, as Mr. <hi>Dirk Wessels</hi> tells me you
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:002849_0118_0FE6773F1265BB68"/>
are, and that there are no Rotten Members nor <hi>French</hi> Spyes among you.</p>
                     <p>9<hi>thly,</hi> The Brethren may remember my Advice which I sent you this Spring, Not to go to <hi>Cadarackui;</hi> if you had, they would have serv'd you as they did your People who came from Hunting thither; for I told you then, that I knew the <hi>French</hi> better than you did.</p>
                     <p>10<hi>thly.</hi> There was no Advice or Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition that I made to the Brethren, all the time that the Priest liv'd at <hi>Onondaga,</hi> but what he wrote to <hi>Canada,</hi> as I found by one of his Letters which he gave to an Indian to carry to <hi>Canada,</hi> but was brought hither. Therefore I desire the Brethren not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him or any <hi>French Priests</hi> any more, having sent for <hi>English Priests,</hi> with whom you may be supply'd to your Content.</p>
                     <p>11. I would have the Brethren look out sharp for fear of being surprised. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all the Strength of the <hi>French</hi> will be at their Frontier Places, <abbr>
                           <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </abbr> at <hi>Cadarackui</hi> and <hi>Oniagara,</hi> where they build a Fort now, and at <hi>Trois Rivieres, Montreal</hi> and <hi>Chambly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>12. Let me put you in mind again, not to make any Treatys without my Means, which will be more Advantagious for you, than your doing it by your selves, for then you will be look'd upon as the King of

                        <hi>England'</hi>s Subjects. And let me know, from time to time, every thing that is done.</p>
                     <p>Thus far I have spoken to you relating to the War.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Then he chid them for their Breach of Faith with <hi>Virginia.</hi> He told them, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that last Spring they had kill'd a fine Gentleman, with some others, and that a Party of the <hi>Oneydoes</hi> was now there at the head of <hi>James River,</hi> with intention to destroy all the <hi>Indians</hi> there-about. They had taken six Prisoners, whom he order'd them to bring to him, to be Restored; and that for the future they should desist from doing any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the People of <hi>Virginia</hi> or their <hi>Indians,</hi> otherwise all the <hi>English</hi> would unite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them.

                  <p>Coll. <hi>Dongan'</hi>s Message to Mr. <hi>De Nonville</hi> at a time when the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> had so lat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But the little Success he had in his Expensive and Dangerous Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, together with the Obstruction that the <hi>French</hi> Trade met with from the War, inclin'd him more effectually to Proposals of Peace, which Coll. <hi>Dongan</hi> was forced to make, and the <hi>

And that no Accident might prevent, Mr. <hi>De Nonville</hi> sent his Orders to all his Officers in the <hi>Indian</hi> Countrys to observe a Cessation of Arms till the Ambassadors of the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:002849_0121_0FE67745A2723108"/>
                     <hi>Five Nations</hi> should meet him at <hi>Montreal,</hi> as they had given him reason to expect in a little time, to conclude the Peace in the usual Form.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Adario,</hi> the chief of the <hi>Deonondadies,</hi> finding that his Nation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come suspected by the <hi>French,</hi> since the time they had shown so much Inclination to the <hi>English</hi> when they attempted to Trade at <hi>Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limakinak,</hi> Resolved by some brave Action against the <hi>Five Nations</hi> to recover the good Graces of the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For this Purpose he Marched from <hi>Missili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makinak</hi> at the head of a hundred Men; and that he might act with more Security, he took <hi>Cadarackui</hi> Fort in his way for Intelligence: The Commandant informed him, that Mr. <hi>De Nonville</hi> was in hopes of concluding a Peace with the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> and expected their Embassadors in eight or ten days at <hi>Montreal</hi> for that purpose, and therefore desired him to return to <hi>Missilimakinak</hi> without attempting any thing that might Obstruct so good a Design.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> being surprized with this News, was under great Concern for his Nation, which he was afraid would be sacrificed to the <hi>French</hi> Resentment or Interest, but dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled his Concern before the <hi>French</hi> Officer. He went from <hi>Cadarackui,</hi> not to return home as the Commandant thought, but to wait for
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:002849_0122_0FE67745C7FACD08"/>
the <hi>Ambassadors</hi> of the 5 <hi>Nations</hi> near one of the Falls of <hi>Cadarackui River,</hi> by which he knew they must pass. He did not lurk there above four or five days before the unhappy Deputies came guarded by forty young Soldiers, who were all surprized &amp; kill'd or taken Prisoners. As soon as the Prisoners were all secured, the cunning <hi>Deonondadie</hi> told them <q>That he having been enformed by the Governor of <hi>Canada,</hi> That Fifty Warriors of their Nation were to pass this way about this time, he had secured this Pass, not doubting of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pting them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ambassadors being much surpris'd with the <hi>French</hi> Perfidy, told <hi>Adario</hi> the Design of their Journey, who, the better to play his part, seem'd to grow Mad and Furious, declaiming against Mr. <hi>De Nonville,</hi> and said, <hi>He would, some Time or other be Revenged of him for making a Tool of him to commit such horrid Treachery.</hi> Then looking stedfastly on the Prisoners (among whom <hi>Dekanesora</hi> was the Principal Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor) <hi>Adario</hi> said to them, <hi>Go my Brethren, I Unty your Bonds, and send you Home again, tho' our Nations be at War: The</hi> French <hi>Governor has made me commit so black an Action, that I shall never be easy after it till your</hi> Five Nations <hi>shall have taken full Vengeance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was sufficient to perswade the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors of the Truth of what he said, who
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:002849_0123_0FE677474029E690"/>
assured him, That he and his Nation might make their Peace when they pleased. <hi>Adario</hi> lost only one Man on this occasion, and would keep a <hi>Satana</hi> Slave, (adopted into the <hi>Five Nations</hi>) to fill up his place. Then he gave Arms, Powder and Ball to the rest of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, to enable them to Return.</p>
                  <p>The Ambassadors were chiefly, if not all, <hi>Onnondagas</hi> and <hi>Oneydoes,</hi> who had been long under the influence of the <hi>French Priests,</hi> and still retain'd an Affection to them; but this Adventure throughly changed their thoughts, and irritated them so heartily against the <hi>French,</hi> that all the <hi>Five Nations</hi> from this time prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the War unanimously.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adario</hi> deliver'd the Slave (his Prisoner) to the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Missilimakinak,</hi> who to keep up the Enmity between the <hi>Deonondadies</hi> and the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> order'd him to be shot to Death. As they carried him out, he related the whole of the Action, but the <hi>French</hi> thinking that he had only contrived it to save his Life, had no regard to it, till the fatal Consequences call'd his Dying Words to their Remembrance, with sorrowful Reflections.</p>
                  <p>The same Day that the <hi>Satana</hi> was shot, <hi>Adario</hi> call'd one of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> who had been long a Prisoner, to be an Eye-witness of his Country-mans Death, then bid him make his Escape to his own Country, to give an
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:002849_0124_0FE67747635BDD58"/>
Account of the <hi>French</hi> Cruelty, from which it was not in his Power to save a Prisoner he himself had taken.</p>
                  <p>This heighten'd the Rage of the <hi>Five Nations,</hi> so that Mr. <hi>De Nonville'</hi>s sending to disown <hi>Adario</hi> in this Action, had no effect upon them: Their Breasts admitted of no thought but that of Revenge. It was not not long before the <hi>French</hi> felt the Bloody effects of this cruel Passion; for 1200 Men of the <hi>Five Nations</hi> invaded the Island of <hi>Montreal</hi> when the <hi>French</hi> had no suspicion of any such Attempt, while Mr. <hi>De Nonville</hi> and his Lady were in that Town. They Landed on the South side of the Island at <hi>La Chine,</hi> on the 26<hi>th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> 1688. where they burnt and sacked all the Plantations, and made a terrible Massacre of Men, Women and Children. The <hi>French</hi> were under apprehension of the Town's being attacked, for which reason they durst not send out any considerable Party to the Relief of the Country, till the <hi>Indians</hi> had blocked up two Forts, when Mr. <hi>De Nonvill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> sent out a hundred Soldiers and fifty <hi>Indians</hi> to try to bring off the Men. The <hi>French</hi> of this Party were all either taken or cut to pieces, except one Soldier and the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officer, who was carried off by twelve <hi>Indians</hi> that made their escape, after he had his Thigh broke. There was above a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

of the <hi>French</hi> kill'd at this time, and Twenty six were carried away Prisoners, the greatest part of which were burnt alive. The <hi>Five Nations</hi> only lost three Men in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, that got Drunk, and were left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. This, however, did not satiate their Thirst after Blood; for in <hi>October</hi> following they destroy'd likewise all the lower part of the Island, and carried away many Prisoners.</p>
                  <p>The Consequences of these Expeditions were very dismal to the <hi>French,</hi> for they were forced to burn their two Barks which they had on <hi>Cadarackui Lake,</hi> and to abandon their Fort there. They design'd to have blown up their Works when they left that place, and for that end left a lighted Match where the Powder lay, but were in such a Fright, that they dur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t not stay to see what effect it had. They went down <hi>Cadarackui River,</hi> in seven Birch Canoes, and for greater Security travel'd in the Night. One of the Canoes with all the men in it was lost by their Precipitation, as they passed one of the Falls of that River. The <hi>Five Nations</hi> hearing that the <hi>French</hi> had deserted <hi>Cadarackui</hi> Fort, 50 <hi>Indians</hi> went and took Possession of it, who found the Match the <hi>French</hi> had left, which had gone out, and 28 Barrils of Powder in the same place, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with several other Stores.</p>
                  <p>The News of the Success the <hi>Five Nations</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Utawawas</hi> had always shown an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the <hi>English,</hi> and they therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately sent openly four Sachems with three Prisoners of the <hi>Sennekas</hi> that they had, to assure them, That they would forever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Friendship with the <hi>French,</hi> and promised to Restore the rest of the Prisoners. They also included seven Nations that liv'd near <hi>Missilimakinak,</hi> in this Peace.</p>
                  <p>This put the <hi>French</hi> Commandant there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greatest Difficulty to maintain his Post; but there was no Choice, he must stand his Ground; for the <hi>Five Nations</hi> had cut off all hopes of Retiring.</p>
