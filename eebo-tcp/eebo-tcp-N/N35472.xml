            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SAINT Paul was eminent for ſerving the Church of Chriſt, not only by his doctrine, but alſo, by eſtabliſhing Churches in order, and appointing proper officers to take the charge and care of them; inſomuch that he ſtiles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a ſpiritual Father; as when writing to the Corinthians, I Cor. iv. 14, 15.—"As my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſons, I warn you, for though you have ten
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:046360_0004_1021419355DDD6E0"/>
thouſand inſtructors in Chriſt, yet ye have not many Fathers; for in Chriſt Jeſus I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten you through the goſpel." But, having ſo great a charge, it was not poſſible for him to continue conſtantly at one place, neither was it for the welfare of Chriſt's kingdom that he ſhould. He preached the kingdom of God, both to Jews and Gentiles, and held forth the ſame God, and way of ſalvation, to both, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caring it was one God who ſhould juſtify the circumciſion by faith, and the uncircumciſion through faith; and that his doctrines had no tendency to make void the law, but to eſtabliſh the law. <hi>Rom.</hi> iii.</p>
            <p>PAUL is now, by our text, diſcharging one part of his miniſtry to the Church at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> having called the Elders together, and informed them that he was about to leave them, for ſome weighty reaſons, as he ſays, I go bound to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> Before he departs, he gives to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and doubtleſs to the people, ſome of the beſt advice; reminding them, what his life and doctrine had been among them; and alſo the many trials and temptations which had befallon him by the lying in wait of the Jews; by the uneaſineſs and diſſimulation of ſome, who were inimical to the doctrines he delivered.</p>
            <p>BUT that which was the Apoſtle's ſupport, muſt be that which will afford comfort to all his
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:046360_0005_102141951EE99300"/>
followers; I mean the ſweet approbation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that in ſimplicity and Godly ſincerity, he had his converſation among them, diſcharged the duty incumbent on him, to the beſt of his knowledge and ability, teſtifying daily repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance toward God, and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Thus, by his ſincere and impartial deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the great things of Chriſt's kingdom, that not only God and his own conſcience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit him, but even they themſelves, that is, the people among whom he had been preaching, were witneſſes, that he was pure from the blood of all men. He had ſo plainly delivered to them the counſel of God, and preſſed the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of goſpel-obedience on their conſciences, that ſhould they never ſee him more, in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, at judgment they could not ſay, they were not ſufficiently warned of thoſe things. I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kingdom of God, ſhall ſee my face no more: Wherefore, I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men, for i have not ſhunned to declare to you all the counſel of God. Though he had done this, he could not leave them 'till he had ſtrictly charged them to great care and watchfulneſs: Being fully acquainted with the ſtate and dangers to which they were expoſed, cauſed him to ſpeak
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:046360_0006_102141986A16E700"/>
with the greateſt confidence—" I know this, that after my departing, ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock." He was ſo fully acquainted with the temper of that people, and the many enemies which ſurrounded them, who, by every artful ſtratagem, entering among them, under the appearance of friends, but not having friendly intents, would be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous wolves, who would not ſpare the flock, and that they were not only expoſed to wolves from without, but from the beſt of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſome of their worſt enemies ſhould ariſe from among themſelves, who would gain a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by ſpeaking perverſe things.</p>
            <p>This a melancholy truth, that the worſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Zion, will always have ſome followers and that ſuch take the opportunity to work, when the Church is in the weakeſt condition, when the watchman is off the walls. This we find has been the method in which the great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of man has made in roads upon Zion, in various ages; that is, when a people were left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of a paſtor: Notwithſtanding we may be ſenſible, that this will really be the caſe, yet there may be reaſons ſufficient to juſtify a ſeparation between a paſtor and people: For, as two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk together except they be agreed—<hi>Amos.</hi> iii. 3.—If unhappy difficulties once take place'
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:046360_0007_10214199F1C78F90"/>
ſo as to deſtroy that love which is the band of union, that notwithſtanding the report may be given by the watchman, and yet the people will not take the alarm; ſuch cannot in the leaſt be benefited by all his watchfulneſs and care; but often are more apt, by a ſpirit of reſentment, to fall away with thoſe who would zealouſly affect them, but not well.</p>
            <p>As this, Sirs, is the melancholy ſtate of this Church and people, that you are deſtitute of a paſtor's care, the grounds of our ſeparation being ſo well known, it would be untimely to mention them at preſent; permit me to ſay with the Apoſtle, though I pretend not with that degree of aſſurance—" that I know this, that after my departing, ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock." As the Apoſtle had a knowledge that this had been the caſe in many inſtances, and from the ſtate and temper of the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded this would be the caſe with them: I have no other way to account for my fears, on this affair, but by the like way of argument, that the like difficulties, which I pray a compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate God to avert—will attend you in your preſent broken ſtate. You are not only in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in common with the reſt of the Churches, to

the aſſaults of the ſower of ſedition, but you are in an uncommon danger, from many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy circumſtances.

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> THAT they are expoſed to grievous wolves.</p>
            <p>FROM the firſt eſtabliſhment of religion, Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has ever had her enemies; the great adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, like a roaring lion, goes about ſeeking whom he may deſtroy: He ranged paradiſe, having leaped the peaceful walls, till he finds his prey; and man, poor innocent man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a victim to his rage and malice, but thanks be to Heaven, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, engages for man, appears as his Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and reſcues him from the power of the infernal prince: And, notwithſtanding, by the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Son of God, the Church is redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her enemies; and, by virtue of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:046360_0009_1021419E08A739A8"/>
with the Father, the Father has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to raiſe up a Church, and that the gates of hell ſhall not finally prevail againſt it; yet the adverſary is not ſo cloſely confined, but that the Church is ſubject to receive from his ſpite grievous wounds, which may all be conſiſtent with that divine ſentence againſt the ſerpent,<hi>Gen.</hi> iii. 15—I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed: It ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel. Theſe bruiſes on the heel, the Church has in all ages received. For wiſe ends ſatan is permitted to range at certain limits, and though he may, by guile, bring mortals into the moſt deplorable circumſtances, yet, as he had no power to compel the firſt happy pair to ſin, neither has he now: Hence ſays <hi>St. John</hi> 1. iv.4,—Greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world. Thus he is ſtyled the tempter—1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> iii. 5.—becauſe his warfare is carried on by guile and ſtratagem; knowing that by open violence and force of arms, he never can great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthen his party, or weaken the Church of Chriſt. Our ſpiritual enemies are ever on their watch, and are never more careful, than when men are careleſs, and off their guard—<hi>Mat.</hi> xiii. 25—while men ſlept, his enemy came and ſowed tares, and the ſervants of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder came, and ſaid unto him, Sir, didſt not
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:046360_0010_102141A29D168880"/>
thou ſow good ſeed in thy field? From whence then hath it tares? And he ſaid to them, an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hath done this. This parable is opened by our Savious, wherein the tares are ſaid to be the children of the wicked one, who were influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to all impiety, and to injure the wheat, that is, God's children, and that theſe were ſent forth by their father, the prince of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>WHEN the watchmen of Zion ſtand on the walls attentive to the approach of the enemy, and the people attentively waiting for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm, they are then not only in the way, in which they may expect the ſpecial aids of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but are more fitly prepared by union of force, to withſtand the fiery aſſaults, and fight, with the whole armour of God: But when, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the people grow inattentive to the call, or the watchman is removed from the tower, ſatan inſtantly ſeizes the opportunity, and marches in the ſwiftneſs of his might, with all his attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, to waſte and deſtroy: His watchfulneſs to evil, we may ſee deſcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> xii.—where he is repreſented as the red dragon, ſtanding before the woman, ready to be delivered of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, to devour the child as ſoon as it was born. <hi>Moſes</hi> is only abſent for a ſhort time, being on the mount with God, and the adverſary ſeizes
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:046360_0011_102141A422753290"/>
that opportunity, to urge the people on to idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry; that the Lord ſays to <hi>Moſes,</hi> "Go get thee down, for thy people which thou broughteſt up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they have turned aſide quickly out of the way—<hi>Exod.</hi> xxxii.</p>
            <p>IN like manner, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> is repreſented as being in a broken ſtate, and guilty of high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, this reaſon is given, as in <hi>Judges</hi> xvii. 6.—In thoſe days there was no king in <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and every man did that which was right in his own eyes—they were deſtitute of any head and leader; and while this was the caſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious inſtitutions were moſtly thrown aſide; various irregular modes and cuſtoms of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip took place, as each one fancied: This, doubtleſs, made Micah ſo gladly receive the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite of <hi>Beth-lebem-judab,</hi> and ſay to him, dwell with me, and be to me a father, and a prieſt—<hi>Judges</hi> xvii.</p>
            <p>BUT further, we find that not only ſatan him. ſelf has been influencing the hearts of men to fall away from their profeſſion: But even of ourſelves have men ariſen ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them; that falſe Chriſts and falſe prophets have ariſen, to do his ſervice. For as there were falſe prophets under the old teſtament, who laboured againſt

the prophets of God; ſo, ſays he Divine Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiv. 24.—There ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and behold, I have told you before.—So he tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 15.—They will come in ſheep's cloathing, but inwardly be ravening wolves, but ye ſhall know them by their fruits. This was the voice, not only of the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but of his diſciples alſo—2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii.—In the laſt days, perilous times ſhall come; men ſhall come forth, having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power, who will creep into hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and lead captive ſilly women, laden with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts, ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
            <p>SUCH as theſe are actually now in the world, and in what danger do people ſtand of being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them, when brought into a broken ſtate; ſuch are the ſocieties they will frequent, and this is the time they will work; by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary appearance of godlineſs ſteel the affections, creep into the heart, and ſo lead away the ſimple, and the unguarded. Diviſions are the loudeſt calls for theſe wolves to come and ſeize the prey; the horrid cries of contention is muſic to their ears; and when the members are at variance, they will more readily gain the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of ſome, by eſpouſing their cauſe:—Hence ſaid <hi>Saint Paul, Gal. iv.</hi> 17.—They zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:046360_0013_102141A81D585C10"/>
affect you, but not well; who would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the fond appearance of a wolf? No more dependance is to be put on thoſe who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the fold of Chriſt, but not by the door, they ſow the ſeeds of all ſedition among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>'Tis too much the unhappy caſe, that, when a ſociety gets thus divided, every one as it were, appears to have ſome particular notions of their own; and they will have no one for their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, unleſs he is in every thing of their mind, even if all the reſt are agreed in him: The ſpirit of diviſion is often a ſpirit of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to anſwer ſome ſelfiſh view; ſome pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no regard to the general good and peace, pay not the leaſt attention to purity of doctrine, or conformity of manners, but open the door with their own hands, to introduce the wolf among their tender lambs.</p>
            <p>THIS has an immediate tendency to ſet up parties and when ſtrength is divided, the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt body becomes weak; and the ſociety which, while united, might have ſtood in defence of pure religion, now becomes a receptacle of all religions, ſects, parties and inconſiſtencies, yea, a ſource of all confuſion and impiety; and what ſport is this, my dear Sirs, to the enemy of all good!</p>

THIS was, in ſome meaſure, for a while, the ſtate of <hi>Corinth,</hi> while one ſaid, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> I of <hi>Apollos,</hi> and I of <hi>Cephas,</hi> and I of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> but ſays the Apoſtle is Chriſt divided?

God's houſe is forſaken—his Sabbaths are forgotten—his precepts are preſently unknown, and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe becomes a burden—and thus to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion will be coupled the moſt fatal ignorance, which is ever an inlet to all error: Men, who are the leaſt qualified to be judges of doctrine, will ariſe up, and be teachers, as the text ſays, "ſpeaking perverſe things;" he will have his diſciples, inculcate things they underſtand not themſelves, and ſo will ignorantly be ſcattering poiſon on the table before their tender offspring: It behoves every ſcribe in the kingdom of God, to be well inſtructed, who can bring from his treaſure things new and old—<hi>Mat.</hi> xiii. 15.</p>

which they fell, inſomuch that the divine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel weeps over their ſituation, as deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when their houſe was to be left deſolate—<hi>Luke</hi> xix. 22.—For the days ſhall come upon thee that thine enemy ſhall caſt a trench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thee, and compaſs thee, and keep thee in on every ſide: Though this may not be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy caſe, with all ſocieties thus divided, yet they are expoſed to it, by the daily aſſaults of ſurrounding enemies; neither need we ſuppoſe there is no danger of being diſturbed by theſe ſeducers—there are ſome in almoſt every ſociety, who are qualified for, and diſpoſed to it; who pay no attention to any principles; others who are poſſeſſed of erroneous ones themſelves; and each of theſe may be ſtrongly engaged to bring in vice and ruin: Therefore we have from Saint <hi>John</hi> I. iv. I. this exhortation: Beloved, believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are of God, becauſe many falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are gone out into the world.—Which brings me,</p>

            <p>WATCH and remember, I ceaſed not to warn you againſt both diviſions and errors—both have the moſt dangerous tendency; diviſion opens the door for error, and error for diviſion: Hence

Paul adviſes, that there ſhould be no ſchiſm in the body—I <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.—but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one for another; and whether one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it. How many and ſharp were the reproofs the Apoſtle gave againſt ſuch diviſions, and how did he give charge to obſerve the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of them. <hi>Rom.</hi> xvi. 17.—Now I beſeech you brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them. Thoſe who once cauſe diviſions, people are much to blame if they are deceived by them a ſecond time; there ſhould a mark be ſet on ſuch, as the Lord ſet a mark on Cain, when he cauſed blood and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in the firſt church and family on earth.</p>
            <p>PERSONS who once divide a people, know not where it will end. to them, ſays Saint Jude, for they have gone in the way of Cain; they are to be ſo marked, that they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

undiſcovered—his voice appears as harmony, a found of peace—his very appearance, as it were, ſpeaks friendſhip; and thus he deceives us, like the fly Adder, that approaches us inſenſibly—whereas the open, furious ſerpent, is often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſlain in his firſt attacks. The wiſe man, who well knew the diſguiſes of the human heart, gives us this advice—<hi>Prov.</hi> xxvi. 24, 25.—He that hateth, diſſembleth with his lips, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up deceit within him, when he ſpeaketh fair, believe him not—for there are ſeven abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his heart. Thus the adulterous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>Prov.</hi> vii. betrayed the young man void of underſtanding, with her much fair ſpeeches, ſhe cauſed him to yield, with the flattering of her lips ſhe forced him:—Of ſuch, a people in an unſettled ſtate, are in great danger. But watch, Sirs, you cannot obſerve them, unleſs you do—and remember I ceaſed not to warn you.</p>
            <p>SUCH, in part, is the character of the wolves mentioned in our text. Our Saviour tells us, they will come in ſheep's cloathing: What crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is eſteemed ſo innocent, ſo harmleſs, as the ſheep: Hence believers are called ſheep, and Chriſt's tender ones are called his lambs: Now how dangerous is it, when wolves put on this appearance; that is, when fly, ſubtle men, to gain a party, will appear in God's Church, as
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:046360_0018_102141B61C39BD10"/>
followers of the meek and lowly Jeſus, but at the ſame time, are of corrupt doctrine, impure hearts, and profane lives; but, bleſſed be God, our Divine Jeſus has given us a mark whereby to know them—by their fruits—<hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 16.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING this is the caſe, that by exact and ſerious obſervation, they may be known, yet how many are ſo deceived by them, as to take from them the greateſt errors and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtencies in doctrine, and alſo to put up with the groſſeſt immoralities in their conduct; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſad inſtances in this and the neighbouring States, evince the truth of this: But are ſuch the followers of Chriſt? Is this the effects of that wiſdom which comes from above, and is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſy to be entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, full of mercy and good fruits, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, without hypocriſy—<hi>James</hi> iii. 17.</p>
            <p>THERE is great danger of your being impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon by men of corrupt doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to avoid this, take the Revelation of God for your ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. <hi>Iſa.</hi> viii. 20.—To the law and the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in them. He who departs from the revealed will of God, and is ever-meddling in the ſecret things of Heaven, cannot bring any thing of importance to your view, but betrays his ignorance. God
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:046360_0019_102141B7A066A998"/>
has plainly told us by revelation, who they are, who ſhall inhabit his holy hill; he has deſcribed the temper of their heart, and the manner of their life, and that, whoſoever will, may come and partake of the waters of life freely. But if any are ſo preſumptuous as to paſs by this, and ſay the ſecret will of God is otherwiſe—which has determined all our ſtates, tempers and actions, before ever the mountains were brought forth, or the foundations of the earth were laid; that the ſecret decree of Heaven, has, without any reſpect to virtue or vice, from all eternity, immutably fixed the ſtate of all mankind, and that he, whom Heaven has decreed, muſt, from a neceſſity of action, be holy of unholy; and that, though a Saviour is provided, at infinite coſt, and offered to all men, and they as earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſted by the revelation of God, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by faith and repentance, declaring that he who believes ſhall be ſaved; but he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not ſhall be damned; yet, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret decree of Deity has put a fatal bar in the way, that only a few can accept; for this was his intentions, that only a few ſhould be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by that great ſacrifice. Is not this to make all the offers, promiſes, invitations, exhortations and threatenings of Heaven, a piece of impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Yea, what better does it repreſent them, than a ſolemn piece of mockery!</p>

THE revealed will of Deity, is for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 4.—Whatſoever things were written aforetime, were written for our learning: But O the depth of the riches, both of the knowledge and wiſdom of God? how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out! Who then, of mortals, hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counſellor, that they ſhould pretend to know his ſecret will or decree!</p>
            <p>THAT doctrine, which repreſents God as the author of all ſin, though perhaps that term may be denied, and they uſe the term "efficient cauſe of all moral evil;" and that ſin is for his glory—this, in my opinion, falls but little, if any thing, ſhort of blaſphemy: When the Lord ſays of ſin, O do not this abominable thing that I hate, <hi>Jer.</hi> xiiv. 4.—And will God work or produce that in us which he hates, which his ſoul loaths, and which he declares is the only cauſe of eternal damnation.

            </p>
            <p>THAT doctrine, which has a tendency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the atonement of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, denying the imputation of guilt and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, has an immediate tendency to rip up the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:046360_0021_102141BC6524E558"/>
covenant of grace, and repreſent the ſacrifice of the Meſſiah, as a piece of needleſs cruelty in God the Father, and not a manifeſtation of his love: Whereas Chriſt ſays, <hi>John</hi> iii.—God ſo loved the world, as to give up his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life; and that God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved; and to effect this, he ſays, I lay down my life for the ſheep, <hi>John</hi> x. 16. Any who diſcourage your attendance on the means of grace, certainly have a tendency to deſtroy the flock of God, and open the door to all licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, they will undoubtedly cauſe diviſions and endleſs debates among you.</p>
            <p>WATCH, therefore, I earneſtly entreat you, and remember I ceaſed not to warn you againſt theſe things; and, though many difficulties may have ariſen to me on this very account, yet they ſhake not my ſtedfaſtneſs; none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear to me, if ſo be that I may finiſh my courſe with joy. I am not aſhamed of that goſpel which I have preached unto you; I have not knowingly kept back any thing that was profitable to you, but have taught you publicly, and from houſe to houſe, repentance toward God, and faith in the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:046360_0022_102141BF94FE15A0"/>
Lord Jeſus Chriſt: I have often, and now tell you that faith, if not coupled with love, is vain: and repentance, if not followed with works meet for repentance, is ineffectual; for our faith muſt be that which purifies and enlarges the heart—and our repentance, be that which reforms the life, that upon it, we become followers of God as dear children.</p>
            <p>BUT watch, and remember I now leave you my laſt teſtimony, againſt thoſe things of which I have theſe few<note n="*" place="bottom">Ordained <hi>December</hi> 13, 1786—Diſmiſſed <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1791.</note> years of my miniſtry, moſt earneſtly warned you; that is, that you be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful both to principle and practice—that you take your principles from the goſpel of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, from the bible of God; and that your prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is in conformity to the divine law, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our bleſſed Redeemer; and that, in order to be happy with him, it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary you be his friends and followers here, for without holineſs, no man ſhall ſee the Lord: That it is immediately neceſſary for us to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by the ſpirit, and not be conformed to this world, but transformed by the renewing of our mind, that we may prove what is that good, acceptable and perfect will of God. There are ſome who would trouble you, and pervert the goſpel of Chriſt; but if I, or an angel from

Heaven, ſhould preach another goſpel to you, let him be accurſed—<hi>Gal.</hi> i. 8.</p>
            <p>WATCH not only their doctrine, but alſo their manner of entrance: He who comes not in by the door, but climbs up ſome other way, the ſame is a thief and a robber: To introduce men of infamous characters, and reprobate lives, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſacred order, is introducing an enemy to wound the Lord Jeſus, in the houſe of his friends. Be careful of thoſe who run before they are ſent. Be careful of ſtrangers, who come without a teſtimony, or with one you know not from whom: How many wounds has reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion received by ſuch, and how has the Church of God been made to bleed and ſtagger, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of men being taken from the plough, and put immediately into the deſk—which now grows faſhionable! Not that I would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as ſpeaking degrading of that neceſſary order of honeſt huſbandmen, but againſt their leaving that employment, and without further qualifications than is neceſſary for that calling, that even the moſt unlearned, the moſt unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified of them, ſhould aſſume to treat in the great things of Zion, not conſidering, that in ſcripture, there are things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt to their deſtruction.</p>

OUR Apoſtle may have reference to ſuch, when he ſays, Of your own ſelves alſo ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, when ſome will ſtart up notions from their own head, and by daily converſing upon them, with the moſt weak and ſimple, they will have diſciples, and error will ſpread. Thus in I <hi>Kings,</hi> xii. it is charged as ſin againſt Jeroboam, that he made prieſts of the loweſt of the people, which were not of the ſons of Levi, and this thing became ſin to the houſe of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to deſtroy it from off the face of the earth."</p>
            <p>How careful ſhould people be concerning thoſe who enter among them, as diſpenſers of the word: Look, Fathers, I entreat you; yea, I charge you, in the name of the living God, ſee who they are who teach, and what are the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines held forth to your riſing offspring, to thoſe tender babes, which are juſt riſing up, and with whom I once expected to live, and with whom I wiſhed to die.</p>
            <p>YOUR charge and care is now doubled, ſtrive together for the faith of the goſpel: The goſpel bears you a precious treaſure, but if you part with this, where are you?—where are your off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring?—where are your ſouls? If through your neglect, poſterity is defrauded of this precious legacy from Heaven, how can you ſtand before

            <p>STAND faſt in the Lord, dearly beloved, give not up that privilege on which your Heaven, your all depends, but be valiant for the faith, and careful at the very firſt appearance of error, for a little leaven will preſently leaven the whole lump.</p>
            <p>REMEMBER that you are now in the foreſt, where there are wolves ranging for prey, and you know not how near they may be, ſeeing they can aſſume the appearance of the lamb.—Make no dependence on tales of extraordinary experiences and enthuſiaſtic revelations; but ſearch the ſcriptures, and ſee whether theſe things are ſo. Be not deſirous after, nor pleaſed with novelty; but ſtand ye in the ways and ſee; aſk for the old paths, where is the good way and walk therein, and ye ſhall find reſt to your ſouls, <hi>Iſa.</hi> vi. 16.</p>
            <p>THE Lord hath ſet you a way, an high way, it ſhall be called a way of holineſs, the unclean ſhall not paſs over it; the wayfaring men, tho' fools, ſhall not err therein." So that if ſome

come, ſaying to you, contrary to what you find in this word, lo here is Chriſt, and lo there is Chriſt, believe them not; Chriſt Jeſus is only to be ſought and found in his own word and way—<hi>Cant.</hi> i. 8. If thou know not, O thou faireſt among women, go thy way forth, by the footſteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beſide the Shepherd's tents.—Learn of him who ſays, if any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether he ſpeak of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now, Brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an inheritance among them who are ſanctified.</p>

            <p>THE Church at Corinth, was greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by Heaven, with goſpel light; it was, for a long time, favoured with the chief of Apoſtles; one whoſe greateſt glory and aim was to build them up in holineſs, and wiſhed even their perfection.</p>
            <p>BUT, notwithſtanding all his care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, he could, by no means, prevail on ſome of them, to be ſuch as he earneſtly wiſhed, but
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:046360_0028_102141CD3833D910"/>
they would even ſtand out, and inſiſt on further proof of his authority, and divine miſſion; though, if any man might plead, he was ſent from God, to treat in the great things of Zion, ſurely ſaint Paul might, who received his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in ſo extraordinary a manner, as he ſays, <hi>Gal.</hi> i.—I certify to you, Brethren, the goſpel which is preached of me, is not after man, for I neither received of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>No people ever had more repeated warnings againſt diviſions, than the Corinthians had from Paul; and theſe diviſions of the moſt dangerous nature; <hi>to wit,</hi> about religion, about the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preachers with which they had been favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Some of them having a peculiar attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſaint Paul, would reject all others, and even contend with the brethren, if they did not; others were for Apollos, others for Cephas, and others for Chriſt: but the Apoſtle would have them to know this was nothing but a vain ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of contention, for each of them were follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Chriſt, and diſpenſers of his word, and that it was wrong for them to contend about names or empty titles.</p>
            <p>'Tis good to be zealouſly affected in a good cauſe, and though our religion is nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs attended with an holy, rational, well-timed,

well-governed zeal, yet the Church of Chriſt has been cauſed grievouſly to bleed, by means of the zeal even of thoſe who would be her friends.—For as all are not qualified to be judges of all religious diſputes, they never can do the Church a greater ſervice than by their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſilence; but when every one will take it upon them, to be zealous diſputants in the holy law, no wonder if various opinions come forth, and many of them inconſiſtent and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Hence ſaint James gives this advice—"Let every man be ſwift to hear—flow to ſpeak—flow to wrath.—'Tis too frequently the caſe, the more any who are zealouſly attached to their own peculiar notions, the more fixed they will be by oppoſition.</p>
            <p>RELIGION, which is a plan adopted of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom, to unite the hearts of men, in the worſhip of the one living and true God, is often turned from its natural current, and held to be nothing more than the diſpute of parties; and, inſtead of its anſwering the great end of its adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is ſubſtituted to the baſeſ ends—has ſhed fountains of innocent blood—rendered a cauſe of diviſion and hatred—a veil to cover the moſt infamous conduct, but ſtill the religion of God ſtands the ſame, however corrupted in the minds of men, and however various their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions;

'tis not for the ſayſos of men, to alter truth in the eye of Deity, or ever to eraſe any of the divine precepts from the eternal mind: The ſame truth which was at firſt delivered to the ſaints, will be found the ſame at judgment, notwithſtanding the various attempts to coin—'till heaven and earth paſs away, one jot or tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the law, 'till all be fulfilled—<hi>Mat.</hi> v. 18. This law—this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is but one—we have but one Lord, one faith, one baptiſm, one God, and Father of all; and though mortals may differ in ſentiment, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout various modes and circumſtantials in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, it may not be unaccountable, according to their various capacities—yet a diſagreement in the eſſentials, is dangerous and gloomy.—Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has drawn the line ſo plain, that the moſt eſſential parts of the divine precepts are intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible to every common capacity; and as he who cannot ſwim, is ſafeſt where the waters are ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, ſo weak minds had better be contented with the knowledge and practice of plain truths; for, perhaps religion has never more ſuffered, than by the deep reſearches of ſome, who would ſpend the whole of their time and talents, in vain endeavours to ſathom and reveal the deep, dark and ſecret things of God.</p>
            <p>REVELATION has long ceaſed, and ſaint John, ſenſible that it contains, and plainly holds forth,

every thing ſufficient to make the ſerious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer, the man of God perfect, thoroughly furniſhed to every good work, cloſes the ſacred canon—teſtifying to every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book. If any man ſhall add to theſe things, God ſhall add to him the plagues written in the book; and if any man ſhall take away from the words of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of this book, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and out of the things written in this book—<hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. So that a departure from the ſcripture truths of God, will ever be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt dangerous conſequences—truth cannot be ſtifled—error, or hereſy, be lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, without a hazard of life; and, though ſome may think, that diſputing about religion, is a ſign of religion—'tis ſo far from it, that our Lord, and his Apoſtles, have ever diſcouraged it, and enjoined, that fooliſh and unlearned queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought to be avoided, knowing that they gender ſtrifes—<hi>a Tim.</hi> ii. 23.—This the Apoſtle labours in our text—that as ſome in Corinth had ſpent their time in that way, he feared they had yet the ſame mind; he wiſhes them to take timely warning—to abandon all thoſe ſins and follies, which had been the cauſe of diviſion among them, and that they ſhould be perfect.—

A CHURCH, though compoſed of many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, is but one—all being parts of Chriſt the Head; and as there muſt be pain in the human frame, if any one member is out of joint, and if it continues ſo for any time, the part affected grows callous, brings on lameneſs to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that the whole body feels the blow; and often, to give relief to the body, a member thus ſhattered, when a cure cannot be made, is to be cut off, leſt the whole be deſtroyed: So it is with the Church, when any one of the members fall away, by continuing in that broken ſtate, there is danger of a great hardneſs taking place between that member and the body, inſomuch that the whole Church, by reaſon of one, all get into diviſions, as if not related—and, perhaps, nothing will reſtore peace, but the moſt ſevere methods of diſcipline; therefore ſays Paul, I write theſe things being abſent, leſt being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I ſhould uſe ſharpneſs; and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when writing to the Epheſians, iv.—that we henceforth be no more children, toſſed to and fro, carried about with every wind of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, by the ſleight of men, and cunning crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.—As love is that which unites a ſociety, this ſhould always be kept pure and perfect; and when any, by any particular diſguſt, or becauſe they are
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:046360_0034_102141DC54C5B020"/>
not gratified in every reſpect, whether in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or government; if they begin to grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy, let them remember, there are other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the body beſide themſelves, and that they are not to be ſingled out, as the only one to be regarded, but the perfection of the whole Church; doctrines are not to be ſuited to the humours of men, but men muſt conform to doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi>"Be of good comfort."—Comfort is that which is to be enjoyed by peace and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: Every one who yields obedience to the divine precepts, who practice the mutual offices, ſignalize themſelves to be true diſciples of Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> xiii.35—by this ſhall all men know that you are my diſciples, if ye love one another:—This muſt be matter of comfort, when we have this evidence in our hearts, and ſo live, that our lives do not contradict our profeſſion; but let us appear ever ſo ſmooth, and make ever ſuch profeſſions of friendſhip, yet if we are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in heart, we cannot have comfort; but this evil temper, like an inward fever, preys on the heart—and, as a perſon in a fever is ever thirſting, ſo ſuch perſons as vehemently thirſt to ſatisfy their minds againſt their fellow-creatures, for ever envious of their happineſs, and watchful for their halting, that if by any means, they
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:046360_0035_102141DDD97F5800"/>
may have an opportunity to vent the ſecret fires of their heart.—The Apoſtle would diſſuade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this dreadful temper—ſo he would wiſh them to be comforted under all the diſagreeable ſcenes of life, under all diſappointments and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als—he wiſhed them this, more immediately, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he was abſent from them.—His dear friends regretted his abſence; he was dear to them as their Spiritual Father, who had begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them through the goſpel. When God is pleaſed to confer any ſpiritual benefit on us by the inſtrumentality of any particular perſon, we muſt be void of feeling, if we have not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regard for ſuch, as the goſpel enjoins— <hi>1 Theſſ v.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> We beſeech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem them very highly in love, for their work's ſake. When we find men deeply engaged to bring us to the enjoyment of that, which is the great deſire of our ſouls—when we loſe them, we are apt to be ſorrowful.—This was the caſe when Paul parted with the Epheſians at Miletus, in order to go to Jeruſalem—it was like the parting of a loving pair, coupled by the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tie—they all wept ſore, and fell on Paul's neck, and kiſſed him, ſorrowing moſt of all for the words which he ſpake, that they ſhould ſee
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:046360_0036_102141E07B1507D0"/>
his face no more—Acts xx.—And when he came to Ceſarea, there were many of his friends to whom he was dear, yet he could not tarry with them, though they beſought him with tears; and when no arguments would prevail on them to deſiſt, he breaks forth—What mean ye to weep and break mine heart, for I am ready not to be bound only, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the name of the Lord Jeſus. At ſuch a time as this, people want ſomething to comfort them—they ſhould remember they are not part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for ever to be aſunder, and though they ſee each other no more in this world, yet this is ſhort, and if they can but take comfort in God, through the conſolations of the Holy Spirit, the hour will quickly arrive, in which they ſhall meet in a world free from diviſions.</p>
            <p>ANY people, on the removal of their paſtor, who has been dear to any of them, ſhould not be comfortleſs—remembering they are but men, but pray to the great Lord of the harveſt, that their wants may be ſupplied; neither ſhould they bear it ill in their minds againſt thoſe whom they conceive to be the means of their loſs, but forgive and exhort one another daily, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering that at judgment all theſe things muſt be accounted for, and that God will do juſtice to every one.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Be of one mind"—in the things of religion; for as there is but one true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he would have them all, without exception, to proſeſs and practice this.—They ſhould all have one end in view, God's glory, and their own ſalvation; and if they all deſired this, that with one accord, they ſhould ſeek it together.—A Church and ſociety aſſembled together(if they are right) are a company, all enquiring for, and travelling to Zion; and how vain is it for perſons, travelling together, to fall our by the way, if one takes more ſteps than the reſt, he muſt not quarrel with them who advance as faſt as himſelf, becauſe they don't take juſt as many ſteps.</p>
            <p>THE deſire of the true unity, muſt centre in the glory of God, and the general good, it ſhould be ſought on terms of equity.—Wherever ſelf is the center of that union we deſire to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and when we would have it accompliſhed on our own terms, and every one have a method of his own, this has an immediate tendency to deſtroy the whole; to be of one mind, is to be regulated according to the rules of the goſpel. Offences will come, but woe to him through whom they come—<hi>Luke xvii.</hi> 'Tis to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he who divides the minds of a people, little thinks on what he is about, when he is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But ſays the text,</p>

               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> "Live in peace;" free from all thoſe contentions to which you have been long addicted—don't quarrel about religion as you have done.—Rom.xii.18.—If it be poſſible, as much as in you lies, live peaceable with all men; with ſome 'tis morally impoſſible to live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if you have any thing to do with them; with ſuch be little concerned, always ſtand ready to do them a favour; if thine enemy hunger, feed him—if he thirſt, give him to drink: If we cannot have dealings with a man but to our own diſadvantage, and the diſadvantage of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, on the account of his uneaſy reſtleſ temper, let him alone; ſuch is the caſe with buſy bodies and tattlers—note ſuch, and have no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them, that they may be aſhamed—yet count them not as enemies, but admoniſh them as brethren. When any are once diſcovered to be diſturbers of the peace, 'tis beſt never to put it in their power to do the like again—let them walk alone—put them into no office—entruſt

them with no ſervices for the ſociety; let them be thus ſignalized, that if any enquire why they are ſo neglected, it may readily be anſwered, they are quarrelſome, miſchievous, troubleſome perſons, who wiſh not to ſerve the general good, but their own private intereſt; this will be the beſt way to quell their temper, and bring them over to the love of peace.—Every one ſhould ſtrive for peace—if there is not a general deſire for it, it is hard, it is difficult to obtain it.</p>

It is this that ſtands as a guard againſt the aſſaults of enemies, and when attacked, will enable us to make the more forcible oppoſition; hence, ſays Jeſus Chriſt, Mat.xii.25.—Every kingdom divided againſt itſelf, is brought to deſolation, and every city or houſe divided againſt itſelf ſhall not ſtand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

ſociety—to let go all religious privileges—to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon all worſhip of God—all care for heaven, and all regard to poſterity—for theſe things muſt inevitably go, if, inſtead of love, there is hatred—inſtead of peace, there is ſtrife—if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of one general enquiry for the way that leads to Zion, nothing is to be heard but vain diſpute about empty terms, and inſtead of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of mutual kind offices, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but wrath, envy and diſſimulation?</p>
            <p>DIVISIONS tend to the deſtruction of all civil and religious privileges: When perſons are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped in this confuſion, they are actuated by ſo blind a zeal, that they finally would ſacrifice every thing that is near and dear, rather than not to gratify and perverſe inclination—though in a few months after, perhaps, they would regret it, as it were, with tears of blood. The diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages ariſing from diviſions are almoſt innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; it caſts ſuch a ſtigma on a town, that it diſcourages perſons of ſober, quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives, from ever gaining a reſidence in ſuch a place, and all on the account of a few haſty, unthinking mortals, who, when they begin a quarrel, know not, but within a few hours, they may be called to the tribunal of a juſt God.</p>
            <p>Love and harmony render any ſociety ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the ſight of Deity itſelf, when built on

the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Chriſt Jeſus himſelf being the chief corner ſtone, in whom all the building ſitly framed together, groweth up to an holy temple in the Lord—<hi>Eph.ii. 20, 21.</hi>—It is this chriſtian ſpirit that will make the Church of Chriſt beautiful as Tirzah—comely as Jeruſalem—terrible as an army with banners—amiabel in the eye of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—venerable and terrible to the eyes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice: When all its members are animated with one zeal, worſhipping the ſame God, with one heart and voice, all governed by the ſame rule, poſſeſſed of the ſame nature, all ſtriving to build up one intereſt, all ſupported by the ſame hope, all ſinging one ſong of praiſe—ſuch a ſight as this, is ſufficient to penetrate the moſt infidel, heart, and force it to ſay, "ſurely this is the ſinger of God." Whatever ſpecious pretences men may make about their religion—one crying up truth, another holineſs, and another order, to juſtify their envying and ſtrife, that hereby they may blind men's eyes; what will all this avail, if their actions do not agree—for them to have ſmooth voices, while the poiſon of aſps is under their tongues; how unlike are they to the true flock of Chriſt, while they thus bite and devour each other!</p>
            <p>CHRISTIAN peace and harmony is the very life of religion, and he who ſights againſt it is a

By this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors are removed, and the ſheep ſcattered on the mountains.</p>
            <p>ANY, who are at any times, acceſſary to ſuch ſcenes as this, what injuſtice do they commit, both on the preſent and future generations—by what means can they repair the damage, or by what arguments juſtify their conduct? Now, ſome of ſuch characters, there have been in the world, it behoves every one to put the important queſtion, Lord, is it I? Lord, is it I? It is a matter of ſo deep a ſtain, that every guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience muſt accuſe, and if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts, and knows all things; but only let men act ſincerely before God, and remember, that for all theſe things God will brings us to judgment.</p>

into my arms with joy, and baptized them in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt: Though I muſt leave you, my warmeſt love ſtill remains with you.—Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, ſo ſtand faſt in the Lord, dearly beloved, I ſhall never deſire a greater joy, than to hear that you all walk in the truth.</p>
            <p>BRETHREN of this Church—bear in mind the days in which we took ſweet counſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which we have eaten of the bread of life at the ſame table—but I am diſtreſſed for you—your walls are ſhattered, the enemy ſtand ready—danger ſurrounds you—yet remember the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that ye have ſworn to the Lord to be his, and engaged, though all men forſake him, yet ye will not. Jeſus, Iſrael's Shepherd, obſerves your walk—walk in love, as brethren of the ſame family—purge out the old leaven—and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the leaven of error—walk in love, as Chriſt alſo loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it—How much the welfare of this ſociety depends on you, I hope you are ſenſible—a ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy well-governed Church, is the ſtrength of a ſociety—but if you are toſſed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, ſickle and inconſtant, you may do that damage that can ſcarcely be repaired: Though it is not probable we ſhall

eat together again, or drink of the fruit of the vine, on earth, may God grant that we may ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the celeſtial board above, and partake at the marriage ſupper of the Lamb; for ſhould I, through grace, obtain a ſeat at the right hand of my Lord, how ſhall it infinitely add to my joy, to find you, once a ſpecial charge, there to meet me in the company of Angels.</p>
            <p>But before I leave you, let my young friends receive a part in theſe my laſt addreſſes—</p>
            <p>THOUGH you are no more to look to me as your miniſter, yet you may ever look to me as your ſure, ſtedfaſt friend. Bear in mind, my dear youth, what from time to time, I have taught you from this ſacred deſk—with what joy have I ſeen your attentive eyes often toward me for inſtruction.—O let my laſt words never be forgotten.—I again exhort you to be ſober mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—let not your minds be ſtained with the tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of diviſion and party; how ſoon will time bring you forward into the ſtanding of Fathers, while they ſhall ſlumber in the duſt! Therefore now ſet out for God—the care of ſociety muſt preſently be your care.—Get yours hearts prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by love—ſhun thoſe rocks againſt which ſo many have undergone ſhipwreck: Though perhaps, you may now be deſtitute for ſome time, of the public orders of religion, yet retain the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:046360_0049_1021410FF8FFDBA0"/>
regard of it in your minds—remember the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, to keep it holy—ſtudy the Bible of God—there take your principles—there form your manners, and be followers of God as dear children; remember that I ſhall meet you at judgment: O let it not be the unhappy caſe, that all my endeavours for your happineſs ſhould be loſt—or that all my prayers and entreaties, with and for you, ſhall only ſerve at that day, as a witneſs for God, that I am clear of your blood, while you are not benefited by them: Renounce, I beſeech you, all youthful follies, and ſhew yourſelves men, that by your firmneſs for ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, your ſtedfaſtneſs for the goſpel, your prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſucceſful endeavours to build up the broken walls of Zion, in this place, generations yet unborn, ſhall ariſe and call you bleſſed, when reaping the effects of your virtues.</p>
            <p>LET me now entreat one and all of you, to, look to religion: Though you are now, Sirs, deſtitute of one to take you by the hand, look to Iſrael's Shepherd for a ſupply—guard for time to come, againſt that which has brought on this ſeparation—guard againſt contention: Let not this be a root of bitterneſs in any of your breaſts, ſo as to hold reſentment againſt any; and ſhould it pleaſe an infinitely wiſe God, to favour you with the re-ſettlement of a goſpel miniſter, I
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:046360_0050_102142066F37A198"/>
ſhall ever rejoice to hear of your affairs, that ye ſtand faſt in one ſpirit, of one mind, ſtriving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the faith of the goſpel, and in nothing terrified by your adverſaries: But, beware, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain entreat you, beware of falſe teachers—re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive none who enter not at the door—hear none who are not ſufficiently recommended—you may be deceived—aſk the advice of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clergy, with whoſe faith you are acquainted and on whoſe advice you may depend.—Forget the many diſputes which have been of ſo long ſtanding among you—theſe are not the life, but deſtruction of all religion and real piety, they tend to gender ſtrife—ſurely you have held them long enough, and have this day ſeen their dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects: Shun all party names—call no man your father on earth, for their is but one Father, even God; take your principles not from men, but the divine word—exerciſe faith in Jeſus, an offered Saviour—imitate his holy life—love his divine character—practice his ſacred precepts—look to him whom you have pierced, and mourn; mourn, mourn ſincerely before God, for all ſin; fly, each ſoul, to the covenant of grace—cloſe in with God.</p>
            <p>I MUST leave you, my friends—I can no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er carry; but weep not for me, but let me weep for you—and indulge me in a flood of tears, for

your beloved, young and tender babes.—I leave you with a compaſſionate God: Fly to the great. Phyſician, for the balm of Gilead, for your wound is grievous.—Should you never ſee me more—O prepare, prepare—each ſoul.—I warn you—I entreat you—I beſeech you, by all the endearing love of the Lord Jeſus, and by every tender tie, as upon my bended knees, that you prepare for judgment.—Attend to the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate calls of God, who ſays, Return ye back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding children and I will bed your backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and receive you graciouſly.</p>
            <p>SET out afreſh for heaven—reſolve to be ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy—Examine yourſelves, whether you be in the faith, and continue therein with a ſtedfaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance.—Heaven, with all its joys, are before you—which can be obtained, if you comply with the offers of the goſpel; and if any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſo reaſonable terms of entering into reſt, I can ſay no more—but at the juſt bar of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judge, you muſt anſwer for it.</p>
            <p>WHO then is wiſe, let him underſtand theſe things; and whoſo is prudent, let him know them. Farewell, Sirs.—May you all, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, walk in the ways of Zion, with undivided, undiverted affections.—This is my laſt requeſt and "if there be any conſolation in Chriſt—if any comfort of love—if any fellowſhip of the

ſpirit—if any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like minded, having the ſame love, being of one accord, of one mind."</p>
            <p>FINALLY, BRETHREN, FAREWELL—BE PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FECT—BE OF GOOD COMFORT—BE OF ONE MIND—LIVE IN PEACE, AND THE GOD OF LOVE AND PEACE SHALL BE WITH YOU.</p>
