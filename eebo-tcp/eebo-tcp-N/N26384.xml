            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>WHEN you quitted the ſmoaky capital, to retire to your delicious reſidence in Northumberland, you enjoined me, my dear Louiſa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to become a conſtant correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent. The requeſt was ſo conſonant to my inclinations, that I yielded to it with alacrity; but I am not without my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions that you will be wearied with the length and number of my epiſtles. I ſlatter myſelf, however, that our friendſhip is eſtabliſhed on ſo firm a baſis, that you will forgive what you cannot approve, and give me credit for my good intentions, ſhould I treſpaſs with prolixity or impertinence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:035084_0003_100007F7741FD388"/>You know, my Louiſa, all the ſecrets of my heart. Conſidering you as my ſceond ſelf, I have ever communicated to you the particulars of my thoughts, words, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; hitherto, indeed, my life has been unchequered with the viciſſitudes of fortune, and hardly furniſhes an intereſting ſcene; but I am reſolved to be no longer unnoticed in the world—no longer conſidered as a mere blank in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>!</p>
               <p>I need not inform you, that I am this day entering into my eighteenth year; and you will, without accuſing me of vanity, admit that I am not very defective in perſon or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments. Do not conſider this, my Louiſa, as an eulogiu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ngle over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from any of the ſex: I therefore, am determined, in juſtice to myſelf to compel them to pay attention to me: and I dare venture to flatter myſelf that before many days are expired. I ſhall behold half a dozen of theſe lords of the creation, ſighing at my feet.</p>
               <p>This may appear romantic to you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further explanation; but my ſcheme is very practicable, though it may be thought to deviate, in ſome degree, from the delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of my ſex. Be that as it may, hazard it I will, regardleſs of the cenſures of the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:035084_0004_100007FE701CF0B8"/>
world, if my Louiſa ſhould but approve the ſtep.</p>
               <p>Beauty, like any other mercantile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, is become an article of traffic in our daily prints; advertiſements indiſcriminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly announce the bargain and ſale of a lady's perſon, or a bale of ſilk; and direct the readers whither they are to repair to treat for the affections of a lady, with as little reſerve as if ſhe had been a hogſhead of ſugar, or any other common article of commerce.</p>
               <p>Taught, therefore, by example, I intend, to purſue the ſame mode. The WORLD ſhall be the vehicle for my advertiſement; it is read by all the world, and will probably produce me many ſuitors. The addreſs I propoſe, ſhall be nearly in the following words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A young lady, pretty far advanced in her teens, thus publicly appeals to the young gentlemen of this kingdom. She has not the ſmalleſt reaſon to accuſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for not embelliſhing her perſon; and Fortune, ſhe admits, has been equally liberal to her. Acquired accompliſhments, ſhe alſo flatters herſelf, ſhe has a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſhare of; and her diſpoſition has generally been thought amiable. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe perfections, which are far from being exaggerated, ſhe has not been
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035084_0005_0FFFB4F34A2D31B0"/>
aſked the material queſtion by any man living. Thus circumſtanced, ſhe candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledges that a ſtate of virginity is ſo irkſome to her, that ſhe would willingly exchange it for a better. Propoſals, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to Belinda, ſealed up, and left at the Bar of the London Coffeehouſe, ſhall be duly attended to, and an interview appointed, if the propoſals appear ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the lady's expectations.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Blame me not Louiſa, for forming a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this kind; for be aſſured I ſhall act with the utmoſt prudence and decorum in the whole of the buſineſs. Never ſhall Louiſa have the leaſt occaſion to bluſh for her affectionate friend,</p>

               <p>YOU aſtoniſh me, my dear Belinda, by the reſolution which you have formed. Be not too precipitate in the execution of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035084_0006_1000080502FFF5A8"/>
ſuch a romantic plan! Excuſe me, deareſt girl, for taking the freedom of a friend.— Suffer me to expoſtulate a little with you, on the impropriety of expoſing your perſon, to the wanton ſneers of a rude rabble; for ſuch will aſſuredly be the fellows who make application for your fair hand, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the advertiſement. I tremble for the conſequences of ſuch a procedure, and conjure you, if you value my friendſhip, to let the idea periſh whilſt it is in embryo.</p>
               <p>Conſider, my Belinda, very few ſerious applications are made to ladies of your age. I am indeed half a year older than you are, and I ſhould look upon any matrimonial overtures as an inſult to my underſtanding; and rather an attack upon my inexperience, than a juſtifiable claim to my affections. Your perſon and talents are ſufficient to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate the richeſt and moſt accompliſhed of the ſex; and, in due time, will certainly be attended to. The men are not thoſe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent beings you would repreſent them; but hitherto you have mixed but little with the world; like a recluſe, you have paſſed a few ſucceſſive years, in pious attendance on an infirm and ancient parent, who is now no more. The fineſt pictures, when not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, are unknown to the connoiſſeurs; but where your ſemblance appears, every man muſt be an <hi>amateur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:035084_0007_10000811DCE6A2C8"/>You are now emerging from the chamber of ſickneſs and deſolation, and will natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive and pay viſits among the circle of your friends. Chance, my dear, will ſoon introduce objects worthy of your eſteem, who will, doubtleſs pay their court to ſuch beauty and excellence as belong to my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda. Why, therefore, ſhould you have recourſe to ſuch expedients as even the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and abandoned almoſt deſpiſe?</p>
               <p>Conſider, my Belinda, how ſoon a female reputation receives a blemiſh; and, when once ſullied, how difficult, nay how impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, it is to remove that blemiſh. A ſingle erroneous ſtep, or a ſtep, even bordering up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on error, will, by the cenſorious public, be magnified into a crime; and my poor, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Belinda, by diſregarding appearances, being conſcious of her own purity and integ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, may incur the calumny of malignant tongues, and loſe the moſt valuable jewel upon earth, a "<hi>good name.</hi>"</p>
               <p>I am too young to aſſume the character of a grave adviſer, and you may probably be ſurpriſed at ſo ſerious a lecture from one who is deſtitute of grey hairs. Had you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted my opinion reſpecting the faſhion of a ribband, or any other article of dreſs and the <hi>ton,</hi> I would have anſwered you with my uſual pleaſantry, and you ſhould have
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035084_0008_0FFFB8016F0640F8"/>
found your Louiſa as ſprightly and frolick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome as ever. <hi>Vive la Bagatelle!</hi>—But, where your reputation and future happineſs in life, are the objects of conſideration, my years appear to double upon me, and I think myſelf as well qualified for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor, as a Seneca, or a Solon.</p>
               <p>You have not been accaſtomed, my dear Belinda, to ſuch epiſtles as theſe from your Louiſa. Often have you termed me, in the purſuit of our innocent <hi>extravagances,</hi> your <hi>little madcap.</hi> Hereafter I ſuppoſe you will think me entitled to the appellation of <hi>your</hi> philoſopher. At all times, however, you may rely upon me as your friend.</p>
               <p>Lay aſide your ridiculous plan, my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda, or you will make me miſerable. Were I poſſeſſed of half your fortune, and a tythe of your perfections, I ſhould think myſelf entitled to the attentions of the firſt nobility. <hi>Apropos,</hi> have you any of the <hi>beau monde</hi> in your quarter, or do you abound in fox hunters?</p>

               <p>PARDON me, Louiſa, if I condemn you for the ſeverity of your epiſtle. I have unboſomed my whole ſoul to you; which I never ſhould have done, had I not been convinced that you entertained the higheſt opinion of my integrity and honor. Do you ſuppoſe, my Louiſa, educated as I have been in the ſchool of adverſity, (though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, liberally treated by the ſickle God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs) that I ſhould ſo far forget myſelf as to hazard my reputation or my honor? No, my dear friend, I wiſh only to ſee the world; to trace out the ſnares which are ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly laid to entrap the unweary ſex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to learn to be upon my guard againſt the ſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agems of ſeducers.</p>
               <p>Either you have flattered me, or you have always entertained a good opinion of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and integrity. You cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuppoſe that I ſhould inſtantly bid adieu to ſuch attendants, without giving them a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035084_0010_1000082A86019518"/>
proper warning, and engage indiſcretion and irregularity in my <hi>ſuite.</hi> Indeed, Louiſa, I am as immaculate as you left me, and am determined to continue unpolluted in thought, word and deed; ſtill, however, I am reſolved to have my humour, and to carry my projected plan into immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. I can, without deviating from the rules of decency, receive the letters of thoſe who are candidates for my perſon, peruſe them, and anſwer them as they deſerve; ſhould any of them diſplay evident marks of being the production of gentlemen, I may probably condeſcend to notice them; but if ignorance or vulgarity are the moſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent features in their epiſtles, I ſhall, with contempt, commit them to the flames.</p>
               <p>Should I even deign to permit an interview with any of my unknown correſpondents, it ſhould be with ſuch as diſplayed evident <hi>traits</hi> of honor, and a liberal education. A gentleman is as well known by his ſtile, as by his deportment; and no impoſtor can impoſe himſelf, in that character, on a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the leaſt diſcernment. With a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, therefore, I have nothing to riſque; with ſuch a man, preliminaries my be talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of; and, if the treaty ſhould not happen to be definitive, the negociation is at an end, and no diſagreeable conſequences can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.</p>
               <p>

               <p>YOUR advertiſement in the WORLD, has ſtruck me like electricity; but, perhaps, as I am an apothecary, you may conſider me as a mere <hi>drug,</hi> and fit only for an <hi>opiate</hi> to a lady of your conſequence.

                  <salute>MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is my uſual cuſtom to lounge away an hour at a coffeehouſe almoſt every morning; during which time I meet with a variety of amuſements in the diurnal prints; but nothing has ſo far excited my attention as your advertiſement, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared yeſterday in the WORLD. There is ſuch an air of ingenuous can dor in that little compoſition, that I am induced to think the writer of it is in earneſt.</p>
               <p>Your addreſs being general, no apology is neceſſary for troubling you with a few lines. As I purpoſe to be a candidate for your hand, you will naturally expect that I ſhould give ſome account of myſelf, before I can ever hope to be favored with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview. I ſhall begin therefore, by giving you a faithful portrait of my perſon, without exaggeration, either on the ſide of flattery or caricature. In point of height, I rather exceed the middle ſize. I am neither lean nor cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent; and my figure is erect and ſtrait.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035084_0015_100008480E503710"/>
The whole ſymmetry of my body will bear inveſtigation, except my legs; they are thought to be ſomewhat out of proportion, nature having been too profuſe in furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe regions. My face is of the oval kind, and my noſe aquiline; my eyes and eyebrows are truly ebon. It would ſavour too much of vanity were I to mention the encomiums which have been laviſhed on them. The ſmall pox has made ſome rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages upon my countenance, but has not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured it; on the contrary, it has ſtamped a degree of manlineſs upon it, which it might otherwiſe have wanted.</p>
               <p>So much for my perſon! With reſpect to fortune, I have not much to ſay; I have a ſmall unincumbered eſtate, which I let for three hundred pounds per annum, and that is all I am poſſeſſed of. I might, indeed, by following the example of my neighbors, almoſt double that income, by raiſing my rents among the tenants; but I am happier at ſeeing them thrive and flouriſh upon my farms, than any augmentation of my rents can poſſibly make me.</p>
               <p>My father, knowing I had but a ſcanty fortune to ſucceed to, bred me to the Bar, to enable me the better to ſupport the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter and appearance of a gentleman. But there were unſurmountable obſtacles to my diſtinguiſhing myſelf in Weſtminſter Hall;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035084_0016_10000852DC1C59A0"/>
I had too much diffidence, and too much honor in my nature, to make any progreſs in the courts of law.</p>
               <p>Were I poſſeſſed of the moſt ſhining talents, I never could condeſcend to proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute thoſe talents, and plead againſt my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for a fee. If I unjuſtly detain the property of the fatherleſs or the widow, and give a lawyer a large fee, his mercenary tongue will move for hours, to varniſh my ſullied character, or to conceal my villainy; without regarding the diſtreſſes of thoſe whom his abilities have robbed of bread.</p>
               <p>Not being able therefore to add to my fortune, by exerciſing my profeſſion; my income would be inadequate to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes, were I not to obſerve the ſtricteſt fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>Permit me then, Madam, to approach you, and ſolicit your fair hand; I feel a kind of <hi>preſentiment</hi> that nature has formed us for each other. My little fortune, added to what you poſſeſs, will afford independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to both. If you will deign to honor me with an audience, I flatter myſelf that I ſhall be able to plead my own cauſe entirely to your ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Should I be ſo unfortunate as to be thought unworthy of an anſwer to this epiſtle, I know not what might be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Piſtols and daggers are alarming

things!—I will not tell you, however, that I ſhall have recourſe to either of them; but I ſhould poſitively be much chagrined to be treated with ſo much indifference. This is the firſt love epiſtle (if it may be ſo called) that I have ever written; and, ſhould it not be honored with your notice, believe me, Madam, I ſhall never write another.</p>

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035084_0018_100008607544F298"/>
your advertiſement. Indeed, Madam, you talk like a woman of ſenſe and parts, when you ſay you are willing to change your ſtate for a <hi>better.</hi> A man need not be a conjuror to know what you <hi>main</hi> by a <hi>better,</hi> for <hi>ſartainly</hi> it is better to be married than not to have a huſband.</p>
               <p>By the holy Shannon, Madam, I am vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in love with you! for though I have not ſeen you at all at all, my mind's eye has been looking at every <hi>failure</hi> belonging to you, and running over all your charms, from the ſole of your ſtocking, to the ſteeple of your bonnet.</p>
               <p>I have no fortune, at preſent; to <hi>ſpaik</hi> of, but I ſhall have when I come to it; for my father (Heaven reſt his ſoul!) has made a will, and appointed me his ſole <hi>predeceſſor</hi> when he dies, which I hope will be <hi>ſpaidily,</hi> for he is as worthy a <hi>craiture</hi> as ever ſtepped upon ſhoe leather. I think, Madam, I have a right to ſurvive my father, <hi>becaiſe</hi> I am told he was born before me. He has got a large ſum of money in the Bank and South Sea, and ſeveral <hi>other</hi> freehold eſtates, which muſt all come to me; for it is not in his power to <hi>laive</hi> it to any body elſe, without altering his will, and that he cannot do, my jewel, <hi>becaiſe</hi> I have got a copy of it in my own poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>He has a <hi>grait</hi> deal of other <hi>terra firma,</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:035084_0019_100008638564EBA0"/>
which muſt all be mine; particularly a large ſhare in the New River Water Works, and the navigation of the Liffy; beſides, he has an annuity of five hundred pounds a year upon his own life, ſo long as he lives, which you know he cannot keep any longer than he can keep his breath.</p>
               <p>You ſee, Madam, I am not a mere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hunter, like ſome of my countrymen; for my own fortune will be immenſe, when my father will be ſo complaiſant as to take himſelf out of this wicked world.</p>
               <p>By way of amuſing myſelf till I come to my eſtate, I play in Covent Garden with a ſedan chair, in partnerſhip with another <hi>jontleman,</hi> who was educated at Dublin Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; but, devil burn the new pavement! it is made ſo <hi>aiſy</hi> and <hi>convainient,</hi> that people ride upon a hackneycoach, or upon their ten toes, whilſt a poor chairman ſtands like a mere cypher, and is no more regarded than a chairman of a porter club, or of the Eaſtindia Company.</p>
               <p>I hope, Madam, you will not conſider my employment as diſgraceful, <hi>becaiſe,</hi> you know, every one is a gentleman who can keep his carriage as I do.</p>
               <p>Pray let me have an expreſs from you, by the penny poſt, to let me know if you have any regard for me. I think I have ſaid enough to win the affections of any <hi>raiſonable</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035084_0020_1000086748A73D90"/>
but if you are <hi>unraiſonable,</hi> the devil go along with you! You ſay your "vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity is irkſome to you;" then who is to be blamed but yourſelf for keeping it any longer; when a <hi>jontleman,</hi> like me, is willing to take you for <hi>better</hi> or for <hi>worſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is ſome little <hi>diſperity</hi> in our ages, I muſt acknowledge; for you are but <hi>eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,</hi> and I am thirty ſix; but that is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not worth making a <hi>botheration</hi> about, for after we have been married <hi>eighteen</hi> years, we ſhall be <hi>both of an age.</hi>

               <p>It is not my intention to <hi>deſaive</hi> any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, eſpecially one ſo amiable as yourſelf; my honor therefore compels me to acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge that I am already married to a <hi>couple of wives;</hi> one of which I left in Crow Street, Dublin, and the other at the Ring's End; but, we were married <hi>without ceremony,</hi> I left them <hi>without ceremony,</hi> and am now at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to beſtow my hand according to my own will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>It is very diſagreeable for a man to be <hi>alone,</hi> except he has got <hi>company</hi> with him; and I am <hi>ſartain</hi> you would find my <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany</hi> more agreeable than to be <hi>alone</hi> with any body elſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ACCUSE me not of preſumption, Madam, for venturing to trouble you with a few obſervations on your conduct, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your addreſs to the Public, on ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting and important a ſubject as matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. I cannot think you are in earneſt; for a young lady with your figure, fortune, and accompliſhments, muſt demand the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reverence of mankind.</p>
               <p>But, whether you are in jeſt or earneſt, let me entreat you, my dear girl, to be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon your guard. Be not entrapped by the ſeducive wiles of the abandoned liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035084_0022_100008756F9FA298"/>
who flatters that he may deſtroy, and who prides himſelf upon the victims he has made.</p>
               <p>Struck by the conſideration of your age and inexperience, I conſidered it as my duty to remonſtrate with you on ſo alarming a procedure. You will the more readily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, my dear Madam, when I inform you that I am a clergyman; and in that character, conſcienciouſly performing what I could not diſpenſe with, without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a violence on my feelings. If in this particular, you think I am overacting my part, I kiſs the rod of correction, and requeſt your pardon; if, on the contrary, you ſhould commend my vigilance for your ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I ſhould eſteem myſelf happy.</p>
               <p>My humble ſituation in life precludes me from making you a tender of my hand, or I would immediately have addreſſed you as a lover; in order to ſnatch you from the danger which apparently awaits you. I am but a poor curate, and may probably long continue ſo, having but little intereſt with thoſe in power; and exaltation in the Church depends wholly upon a man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions.</p>
               <p>I pretend not to ſuperior talents, or to a more exemplary life, than many of my cloth; but, admitting that my abilities and conduct were in the higheſt degree meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035084_0023_10000876F54150E8"/>
how little would they avail againſt the influence of connexions! Obliged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the character of a gentleman, I am ſtarving upon the paltry pittance of fifty pounds a year; whilſt ſome of the meaneſt mechanics in this metropolis, acquire double that ſum annually; and, with a mixture of pity and contempt, expreſs their ſorrow for a poor miſerable journeyman parſon.</p>
               <p>Should you, however, condeſcend to take compaſſion on me, and, by honoring me with your hand, lift me from poverty to happineſs and independence, how much would you be entitled to my gratitude; and how zealouſly ſhould I endeavor to deſerve a favor ſo diſtinguiſhed and ſo unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! But I condemn my arrogance and ſelf deluſion, having as great pretenſions to a mitre, as to ſuch unparalleled generoſity from Belinda.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, Madam, even for ſuggeſting ſo extravagant an idea. Let me obſerve, however, in mitigation of my preſumption, that, though I am indigent, I am unincum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with debt; no man having a claim upon me for a ſingle ſhilling, It is poſſible, Madam, that you may receive applications from men, who, with the appearance of affluence, may be infinitely worſe than nothing, and your fortune may be in ſome
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035084_0024_1000087DAAD6C048"/>
degree exhauſted to ſatisfy the demands of his clamorous creditors.</p>
               <p>Though theſe obſervations, ſo far as they reſpect myſelf, may be ineffectual; yet I hope they will admoniſh you to be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wary and circumſpect. Your unſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years may be amuſed by miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſpecious promiſes; and you may find, at length, that you have liſtened, with too credulous an ear, to the proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mercenary or the abandoned.</p>
               <p>But how am I deviating from the path I entered upon! When I ſat down to write to you, I was actuated by the pureſt principles, to diſſuade you from attending to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of others, and I am imperceptibly drawn in to tender propoſals of my own. But ſhould they be honored with your attention, or even excite your curioſity to be further acquainted with them, ſtill I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to examine them with the niceſt penetration.</p>
               <p>But, leſt I ſhould ſwell my letter to the bulk of a moderate ſermon, and deter Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda from paſſing through it, I muſt haſten to a concluſion; but I cannot take my leave of you, Madam, without ſubmiſſively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching you to liſten to my own overtures; or, if they ſhould be deemed unworthy of your

               <p>I once put up to be a common council man of <hi>Cheap</hi> ward, but it turned out to be a very <hi>dear</hi> piece of buſineſs; and, what was worſt of all, I came off ſecond beſt.

I am a man of ſome <hi>a count,</hi> and not a mere <hi>venturer</hi> and beggar. Beſides, Madam, I am <hi>comed</hi> of a very good family; for my great grandfather of my mother's ſide was a large biſket baker in <hi>Horſeliedown</hi>; and great grandmother of my father's ſide mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the firſt couſin of a capital ſoapboiler, in Swine Alley, Barnaby Street.</p>

               <p>You perceive, Madam, that I am a man of <hi>rudition</hi> and <hi>reading,</hi> and I have a moſt <hi>purdidgeous</hi> memory.

               <p>BELIEVE me, my Louiſa, I receive as many letters as if I had been in a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal department in the ſtate; and more are inceſſantly arriving. Lawyers, clergymen, apothecaries, fiſhmongers and newſmongers, compoſe a part of my correſpondents.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I have not any reaſon to regret the adoption of my ſcheme. It affords me amuſement, keeps me from <hi>ennui,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs me, in ſome meaſure, in the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the world.</p>
               <p>As I expected, I received epiſtles of various kinds; ſerious and humorous; whimſical and ſolemn; ſarcaſtical and ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous. An apothecary recommends himſelf to me as a drug; a lawyer very obligingly offers to partake of my fortune, becauſe he he has too much honeſty and honor to ſupport or defend an act of villainy; and a very ſententious clergyman adviſes me to be
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035084_0035_100008A842A742A0"/>
extremely cautious and circumſpect, in a matter of ſuch great importance.</p>
               <p>Among the ludicrous letters that have yet come to hand, may be reckoned that of a blundering Hibernian, who declares himſelf to be a gentleman of large expectations, but chooſes to amuſe himſelf with carrying a ſedan chair!</p>
               <p>Another is from an impertinent puppy, who deſires me to return to boarding ſchool. This is the moſt inſolent epiſtle that I have received. It is evidently the production of ſome empty coxcomb.</p>
               <p>A wealthy butcher, in the true Smithfield ſtyle, ſolicits my hand, either for himſelf or ſon, and gives a very curious and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account of himſelf; and a Mr. Salmon deſires to be <hi>ſerved up</hi> to me, not conſidering that Lent is juſt expired.</p>
               <p>A freſh packet of letters has this moment arrived, which would take ſome hours in the peruſal; but they ſhall remain unno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed by me, till I have diſcharged my duty to my Louiſa.</p>
               <p>Had I ſufficient leiſure, I would copy the letters as I receive them, and tranſmit thoſe copies to you; but I am ſufficiently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in reading them only. You muſt therefore wait with patience till you return to London, when you will certainly have a
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035084_0036_100008B26D69E678"/>
delecious treat in looking over thoſe which I ſhall recommend to your peruſal.</p>
               <p>I am really of opinion, my Louiſa, that, among my epiſtolary wooers, I ſhall be able to make a prudent and judicious choice. One or two, who have already favored me with addreſſes, ſeem perfectly qualified to render any reaſonable woman happy, if mental qualifications are eſſential to that end. My fortune is more than ſufficient for the ſphere of life in which I intend to move; then why ſhould I require an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that fortune, or ſeek for an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in an huſband?</p>
               <p>A match, upon ſuch a conſtruction, could be but barter for barter; where, like two plodding partners, each may be conſidered as having brought in his full proportion of the articles in trade, and that neither of them are indebted to each other.</p>
               <p>My diſpoſition is of a different, and I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf of a nobler turn. It is a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſatisfaction to me, to confer favors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even the deſire or expectation of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn! I ſhould be happy in beſtowing the means of happineſs on a man whom I eſteemed, and in receiving thoſe returns of affection which the grateful are ever ready to pay. But, where mercenary marriages are negociated, and ſhilling for ſhilling is the ſtipulation on both ſides, the equality of
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035084_0037_0FFFB5241ACDA608"/>
the parties is principally contended for, and a man treats his wife with common decency and reſpect, from no other motive than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe advanced her ſhare of the capital ſtock.</p>
               <p>Such people, my Louiſa, are deſtitute of ſentiment and feeling. There is a pleaſure in conferring and receiving favors; but where there are cautious ſtipulations and every act is performed for a valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, a generous heart ſhudders at the idea.</p>
               <p>I hope you are, by this time a little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reconciled to my project. As I have found time, notwithſtanding I am ſo much engaged in buſineſs, to write you this long epiſtle, I expect one of the firſt magnitude from you. Favor me with a deſcription of the country round you, and with ſome account of your neighbors. Tell me if there are any pretty fellows within a reaſonable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of your manſion; but, above all, be particular in informing me when I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the pleaſure of ſeeing you in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis.</p>

               <p>IF your heart is capable of feeling for the unfortunate, I may flatter myſelf that you will take compaſſion on me; or at leaſt, that you will condeſcend to pay ſome atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my diſaſtrous tale.</p>
               <p>In my early youth, indeed, nothing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial happened to me of a calamitous nature, except the loſs of an indulgent father and mother; but ever ſince I approached man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, a ſeries of misfortunes have attended me.</p>
               <p>At the age of twenty, I ſucceeded to an eſtate of fifteen hundred pounds per annum, and upwards of thirty thouſand pounds in caſh; ſo affluent a fortune I thought would enable me to adopt a genteel mode of living, without injuring my circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Having only an antiquated manſion houſe upon my premiſes, I ordered a new
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035084_0039_0FFFB526C7A974D0"/>
one to be erected in the modern ſtyle, on which I expended ſeven thouſand pounds, and about a fourth part of that ſum in the moſt elegant furniture I could procure; but, before I was in the actual occupation of it, the whole building took fire, and that and the furniture were all conſumed to aſhes.</p>
               <p>Prior to this accident, I had depoſited up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of ten thouſand pounds in the hands of a merchant, whom I conſidered as my banker, and meant to draw on him for caſh as I might occaſionally want it. He was a director of the Bank, a member of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a governor of many of the city hoſpitals. He was ſaid to be immenſely rich by all who knew him, and I thought my property as ſecure as if it had been in the funds; when, gueſs at my ſurprize, Madam, the very next day after the flames had lev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled my new manſion with the ground, I read my merchant's name in the Gazette, introduced with a <hi>whereas</hi>; and I have ſince received a dividend of only two ſhillings in the pound.</p>
               <p>I ſhould have had an equivalent for all theſe loſſes, by a twenty thouſand pound prize, had I not fooliſhly parted with my ticket to a neighbor. I had purchaſed it for myſelf with a determination to ſtand the chance of it; but, being then in London, I received a letter from a gentleman in the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035084_0040_100008BD0B20D0E0"/>
country, requeſting me to purchaſe him a lottery ticket. Unwilling to quit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I was then engaged in, to repair to a lottery office, I ſent my own ticket to my friend, thinking I could buy another at my convenience; and <hi>that</hi> ticket was afterwards drawn a prize of twenty thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>Certainly I was born under the influence of ſome unlucky planet; for, not long after this very provoking accident, fortune, in one of her freaks, deprived me of a conſiderable legacy. A diſtant relation of mine, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his death approaching, gave inſtructions to an attorney to prepare a will, wherein he had bequeathed me five thouſand guineas; the will was engroſſed, read and approved; but, juſt as he was about to ſign and execute it, he called for a glaſs of cold water, and drank it; which immediately threw him into convulſions, and he dropped down dead. By his thus dying inteſtate, I loſt the five thouſand guineas, that were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me, and the heir at law (who would have been cut off with a ſhilling, had the will been executed) ſucceeded to a very large real eſtate.</p>
               <p>Chagrined at ſuch a ſucceſſion of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and my ready caſh being all exhauſted, I applied to an advertiſing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lender for a preſent ſupply; who readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertook to diſcount my own notes for
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035084_0041_0FFFB52D351FE250"/>
any ſum I might require, at the moderate and legal intereſt of five per <hi>cent.</hi> He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, however, that it was uſual, on ſuch occaſions, for the borrower to allow a ſmall premium to him, as agent between the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower and the lender. To enforce the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his receiving ſome little reward, he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he muſt guarantee ſuch notes, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorſing them himſelf, which rendered him liable to pay the whole ſums, provided I did not honor them regularly as they became due; politely obſerving, at the ſame time, that he did not imagine he ran the leaſt riſque with a gentleman of my ſeeming probity.</p>
               <p>There appeared to be ſomething ſo plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and proper in the man's conduct, in this buſineſs, that I ſubmitted to his terms, and drew three promiſſory notes for five hundred pounds each, at two, four, and ſix months after date, and preſented them to him, rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his proteſtations that he would furniſh me with caſh for them at the hour of two the next day. I waited impatiently for the arrival of that hour; but my plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Jew never made his appearance; and I never heard of the ſecurities I had given him to negociate, till after the expiration of two months, when I was arreſted for five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, the amount of the firſt note that became due.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:035084_0042_100008C443B52478"/>I remonſtrated with the ſheriff's officer on the cruelty and injuſtice of the tranſaction; who unfeelingly replied, that it was of no conſequence to him, nor did he wiſh to be informed of any of the particulars; he had got a warrant to arreſt me, and that was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for him. Without further ceremony, he conducted me to a ſpunging houſe, where I was confined till I found means to procure the money to pay the note, and coſts of ſuit.</p>
               <p>As the two other notes ſucceſſively became due, I was treated in the ſame inhuman manner, and actually paid the whole fifteen hundred pounds, though I had not received a ſingle ſhilling upon any of the ſecurities.</p>
               <p>I conſulted lawyers, whether it was poſſible by any means to evade the payment of them, as it was evident they had been ſwindled from me; but, as they had paſſed through ſeveral hands, and had been endorſed from one to another for a pretended valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, they adviſed me to ſubmit to my preſent loſs, rather than engage in expenſive ſuits, which would probably terminate againſt me.</p>
               <p>In order to raiſe money to get rid of this infamous buſineſs, I was compelled to mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my eſtate, upon which I borrowed ten thouſand pounds. The remainder of that ſum is now almoſt conſumed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="unknown:035084_0043_100008C963CA3370"/>Theſe, Madam, are a few of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes which I have experienced; but you may be aſſured I ſhall be extremely wary for the future.</p>
               <p>If you, Madam, will condeſcend to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice me, I think I ſhould receive an ample recompenſe for all the untoward events that have befallen me.

               <head>LETTER XIII. <hi>MR. STANZA,</hi> to <hi>BELINDA.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>YOUR advertiſement, Madam, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited my curioſity, and I have preſumed to become your correſpondent. I cannot, however, boaſt of any large poſſeſſions or expectancies, my eſtate being all <hi>perſonal,</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word; for I have only my perſon that I can call my own. I am ready to ſettle that on you, Madam, at any time; but, as I cannot ſay much in commendation of it, I am almoſt afraid to recommend it to you.</p>
               <p>Having no income but the produce of my brain, I may literally be ſaid to live upon my wit. Conſequently my table is but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſpread. Turtle and capon I know not even the taſte of; and inſtead of a ſirloin ſmoking on my board, a mutton chop, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accompanied with pickles or other provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, frequently conſtitutes my whole bill of fare.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:035084_0045_100008CD84F8CFD8"/>When I attend my duty in the houſe of commons—miſtake me not, Madam, for I am not a member of that auguſt aſſembly, but only act in the character of a reporter— every ſpeech delivered by any of the ſenators of that houſe, I commit to memory, and ſerve it up to the public the next morning. Probably, Madam, you may take in the <hi>World</hi>—That paper is devoted to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions—The Speeches in Parliament, Memoirs of ſchool boys, the fabrication alluding to <hi>crim. con.</hi> and all the caſualties in that performance, are entirely my own compoſitions.</p>
               <p>Indeed I am thought capital at a caſualty, few of my profeſſion preſuming to attempt to vie with me in that department. No longer ago than yeſterday, I overſet a boat under London bridge, by which accident two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and three ladies were drowned; and to render the ſhock as great as poſſible to the reader, I made one of the ladies in the laſt month of her pregnancy.</p>
               <p>On the ſame day I ſtole an infant, the only iſſue of a rich and reputable family, from the arms of the nurſery maid, put out its eyes, and ſold it to a beggar woman in Whitechapel.</p>
               <p>During the drawing of the laſt lottery, I killed as many <hi>pigeons,</hi> by throwing them
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035084_0046_100008D226F03748"/>
from their horſes, as would furniſh half a dozen dove houſes.</p>
               <p>I am thought to be particularly excellent in a murder. A murder of my committing is immediately known by an intelligent reader, becauſe it is always attended with ſuch peculiar circumſtances of horror. I am allowed a ſhilling each for all my mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, whilſt others are glad to furniſh thoſe articles at only half the price.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, when advertiſements run ſhort in our paper, I am ordered by the conductor, to make about half a column of ſcandal, which is one of the eaſieſt taſks in the whole province of literature. I acknowledge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that I feel ſome little remorſe in fab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricating articles of that nature. Were it not in the way of buſineſs, it would be a ſpecies of cruelty to rob a lady of her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and load the huſband's forehead with a pair of imaginary horns, for ſo trifling a conſideration as I uſually receive. I have occaſioned at leaſt half a dozen ſeparations between huſband and wife, by inſinuations and oblique charges, when the lady has been as chaſte and innocent as Diana.</p>
               <p>Do not imagine, Madam, that my abilities are limited to the productions of a diurnal paper. I ſometimes aſſociate with the Muſes, and pick up a penny in the poetic line. When I have got a few ſhiners in my pocket,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035084_0047_100008D4EB684630"/>
I attempt heroics, and often with ſucceſs. As my caſh diminiſhes, my genius dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhes of courſe, and then I can only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſonnets and other inferior lyric compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. If my laſt guinea ſuffers tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, the wings of my imagination are ſo cloſely clipped, that I am then fit only for elegy.</p>
               <p>Once in my life time, I attempted to write a tragedy, but the managers of the royal theatres thought proper to reject it; ſagaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerving, that it was too deep and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Was there ever ſo ridiculous a reaſon aſſigned for not performing a dramatic piece, of ſingular excellence? Can any thing be more abſurd than to condemn a tragedy for being tragic?</p>
               <p>My tragedy was called, "<hi>The Incendiary; or,</hi> 1780." The <hi>plot</hi> had ſome gunpowder in it and a large quantity of hemp. When I came to the <hi>denouement</hi> in the laſt act, one of the moſt awful ſcenes are repreſented, that I believe has ever appeared on any ſtage. No leſs than three gallowſes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited at one view, and ſixteen malefactors! pendant from each gallows. Was there ever a more noble ſpectacle! and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſolemnity, ſublimity and dignity of the tragic Muſe?</p>
               <p>I fear, Madam, you will think me too prolix; but, when I profeſs myſelf a ſuitor
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035084_0048_100008D793B6EBB8"/>
to a lady, it is neceſſary that I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint her with the reaſons on which I build my pretenſions to her hand. I wiſh, Madam, to become your huſband; but I ſhould not expect that you would honor me with an anſwer to this epiſtle, had I not pointed out a <hi>viſible</hi> method of getting bread for myſelf and partner.</p>
               <p>With your pecuniary aid, I would engage to eſtabliſh a new morning print upon the moſt permanent footing. Should ſuch a journal appear, as I am capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, the publications of the day muſt hide their diminiſhed heads. The <hi>World</hi> would then be at an <hi>end;</hi> the <hi>Poſt</hi> would be <hi>deſerted;</hi> the <hi>Public</hi> Advertiſer confined to a few <hi>private</hi> hands; and the <hi>Herald</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Purſuivant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſome thoughts of taking away one of the gallowſes from the cataſtrophe of my tragedy, and preſent it a ſecond time to the managers, but I will not give up the other two, to pleaſe all the critics in the univerſe.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude, I muſt beg you to give me an audience; when I will produce ſuch credentials as, I flatter myſelf, will convince you that I am not wholly unworthy of your attention.</p>

My towering hopes are withered in the bud, and diſtreſs and miſery await me!—Baniſhed from thee, the world will become taſteleſs, and life a burthen!

               <p>At this moment my enamored ſwain took a moſt reſpectful leave of me, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to my dreſſing room.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given you, as faithfully as my memory will permit, the firſt dialogue between me and my northern lover. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his ſuit with great <hi>naivete</hi> and ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but gradually improved as he acquired more confidence, and at laſt acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very handſomely.</p>
               <p>I freely acknowledge to you, Belinda, that he is far from being indifferent to me; and though I affected to wiſh him gone, by talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the lateneſs of the hour, and bidding him good night, I was as deſirous of his ſtaying as he could poſſibly be.</p>
               <p>I <hi>expect</hi>—I am not aſhamed to ſay that I even <hi>hope</hi>—his ſecond viſit will not be long
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035084_0058_0FFFB532A89217D8"/>
delayed. I feel a partiality in his favor, and apprehend he will find no great difficulty in ſubduing me.</p>
               <p>Appearances, however, muſt be preſerved for a time, and I muſt affect reſerve and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to avoid the imputation of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs. You are a happy girl, Belinda, in having ſo many ſtrings to your bow; whilſt I, like the almoſt deſerted hen, muſt laviſh all my affection upon a ſingle chicken.</p>
               <p>You ſhall be regularly informed, poſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poſt, of my lover's progreſs. As his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is reported to be immenſe, my fears are alarmed that my little portion may be thought too inadequate, and, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of mercenary relations, the youth may ſlip through my fingers. But, if I can read countenances, on his it appears in legible characters, that he is completely done for—nailed! rivetted!</p>
               <p>My thoughts are ſo thoroughly engaged on my new victory, that you muſt ſuffer me to poſtpone the deſcription of the adjacent country, which you ſo ſtrongly ſolicited in your laſt. My ſwain will probably expect me to accompany him in a few jaunts, which will enable me the better to perform the taſk you have impoſed on me; but our's will be a romantic peregrination, and inſtead of hunting foſſils, antiquities and ores, we ſhall ſearch after enamelled meadows, laved by the

               <p>BEING a gentleman and a baronet, I take the liberty to become your correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. I once had a tolerable good eſtate, but now have only a ſcanty annuity, barely ſufficient to keep myſelf above want, and my apparel from being ragged.</p>
               <p>But my diſtreſſes, thank heaven, ſhall nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attempt me to act diſhonorably by falſe repreſentations. I have a title to beſtow,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035084_0060_0FFFB5344065B328"/>
Madam, and a title only. If that ſhould merit your attention, you may command my attendance at a moment's warning; but, if you ſhould not deem that title equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to your fortune, our treaty is at an end.</p>
               <p>Permit me, however, to obſerve, that I am not deficient in perſonal or mental qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifications, and my age does not exceed twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix. You need not be precipitate in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me an anſwer. Take time to deliberate, before you come to a determination. You know, Madam, the reſpect due, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty paid to a title, by the univerſal conſent of mankind, and how reſpectable the title of <hi>my Lady</hi> is conſidered in all companies, and upon all occaſions.</p>
               <p>You have a fortune without a title, and I am in the actual poſſeſſion of a title with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a fortune. By a union we ſhould both have titles, and an ample independence; both of us would be gifted with preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and fortune.</p>
               <p>Nor do I conſider it as deſcending from my rank, when I deign to make propoſals to a lady of your ſeeming abilities and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etration.</p>

as the title of Baronet will belong in hereditary courſe, to the moſt diſtant progeny of the houſe of Hatton.</p>
               <p>It is in your power, Madam, to be Lady Hatton, and your real friends will adviſe you to embrace ſo fair an opportunity.

               <p>EXCUSE an undertaker, who, for a moment neglects his deceaſed friends, to lay himſelf at the feet of a moſt amiable young lady. I have a flouriſhing run of buſineſs, which will fully enable me to ſupport a lady
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035084_0062_10000903186DE030"/>
in an elegant ſtyle. On the very day that you advertiſement caught my eye, my wife took a final leave of this ſublunary world, and has left me a widower. She was a good wife and merits decent interment. A hearſe and ſix, decorated with plumes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by three mourning coaches, ſhall conduct her to her laſt home.</p>
               <p>How opportunely has ſhe quitted the theatre of life, when ſo fine an opening pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents itſelf to furniſh me with another!</p>
               <p>Luckily for me, Madam, we have had a very unhealthy ſeaſon, and I have driven a roaring trade for theſe ſeveral months paſt. I have buried many of my beſt friends, and, if the reigning fever ſhould continue its ravages, I am not without hopes of attending the obſequies of as many more. A young phyſician in my neighborhood has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little, to accelerate their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. That he may live long and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is the foremoſt of my wiſhes!</p>
               <p>There are many advantages, Madam, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to my profeſſion. Elm of an inferior price, as effectually ſerves for a wooden manſion, as that of the firſt quality, and the inhabitant never can complain of the architecture. Heirs at law, executors, and legatees, always pay the undertaker's bill, without taxation or grumbling, eſpecially if the deceaſed cuts up pretty handſomely;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035084_0063_10000906DBC7D8D0"/>
and, if he leaves the world as he found it, ſome pious relative generally undertakes to perform the laſt ſervice liberally.</p>
               <p>Really, Madam, I am in a moſt excellent line of buſineſs, and have had the pleaſure and happineſs of burying ſome of the firſt nobility. I lately was employed to conduct the funeral of one of the moſt benevolent gentlemen that ever exiſted; his loſs was univerſally lamented, except by me and his legatees. Had I not been his undertaker, I would have ſincerely wiſhed him a longer life!</p>
               <p>Probably you may have a friend at Court, who may have intereſt to procure me the management of a royal funeral. What a flattering proſpect for a man in my line of buſineſs! for, as the family are numerous, the common courſe of mortality will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently create a job for me. Far be it from my thoughts that ſuch melancholy events will give me pleaſure, but when a perſon's time is come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Madam, I may as well bury him as any other undertaker.</p>
               <p>Should I be ſo unfortunate as to ſurvive you, Madam, you ſhall be interred with all the pomp and trappings of my profeſſion. Mutes ſhall be poſted at my door, eſcutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones and plumes ſhall decorate your hearſe; and your funeral ſermon ſhall be preached by a doctor in divinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:035084_0064_10000909765BB9C8"/>As a very tender connexion may poſſibly take place between us, you may command my ſervices, upon the moſt moderate terms, if any of your relations ſhould happen to take a trip into the other world. You per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, Madam, that I have an eye to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon all occaſions; and, though I may not be ſo happy as to be the object of your choice, I ſhould be proud to be your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker.</p>
               <p>I dabble a little in the buſineſs of an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holſterer, and ſhould you fix on any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than myſelf, to be your happy huſband, ſuffer me to furniſh the bridal bed, that you may conſummate in clover.

               <p>I am that <hi>compoſition,</hi> Madam, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly adapted to the nature of your <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</hi> If a medicine of this kind ſhould not be ſpeedily <hi>adminiſtered,</hi> the <hi>diſorder</hi> may become <hi>violent,</hi> and recourſe muſt be had to <hi>refrigerents, evacuants,</hi> and <hi>annodynes.</hi> The <hi>diet</hi> too ſhould be cooling and light; ſuch as whey and vegetables. <hi>Bleeding</hi> is proper, and ſhould be often <hi>repeated,</hi> eſpecially if the <hi>pulſe</hi> be ſtrong and quick. <hi>Cathartics,</hi> ſuch as <hi>cremor. tart.</hi> with <hi>rad. jalap. ſal. cathart. amar. tamarind. mann. elect. lenit.</hi> with nitre diſſolved in whey, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>You ſee, Madam, that I am as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the treatment proper for the <hi>amorous,</hi> as the <hi>iliac</hi> paſſion. I ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to underſtand the ſcience of medicine, having been regular trained to it in all its ſtages. I ſerved ſeven years to a farrier, during which time I acquired a perfect knowledge of the ſtructure of a horſe, and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035084_0068_1000091672B13FC8"/>
the moſt effectual methods of combating the diſeaſes incident to that noble animal.</p>
               <p>At the expiration of my apprenticeſhip, <hi>I walked the Hoſpitals,</hi> as it is generally term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not as a regular pupil, who pays a valuable conſideration for being permitted to attend medical and chirurgical operations. When an opportunity preſented itſelf, I mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with others, and ſtole as much knowledge and experience, as would have coſt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum, had I proceeded in the regular mode.—At length, thinking myſelf fully qualified as a phyſician, both for man and horſe, I deſerted the hoſpitals, and without further ceremony, took a ſhop in a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable neighborhood; put up, in gold letters over the door, <hi>Peter Potion, Surgeon and Apothecary</hi>; and for ſome hours in the day, amuſed myſelf with thumping the peſtle in the mortar. This continual <hi>ſound</hi> of buſineſs, together with a fine chemical and galenical exhibition at the window, ſoon produced ſome real patients.</p>
               <p>Having picked up a few old volumes on medicine and ſurgery; ſuch as <hi>Heiſter, Aſtrue, Sharp, Hunter,</hi> and <hi>Le Dran</hi>; I ventured to undertake any caſe however difficult, and generally by the aſſiſtance of thoſe authors, performed a cure or at leaſt gave ſuch medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as afforded a palliation. To ſome, however, I fear I gave a paſſport to the other
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035084_0069_10000917FA57F960"/>
world; but I have the conſolation to think that I exerted my beſt endeavors, and the beſt phyſician could have done no more. The moſt eminent of the faculty are often obliged to work in the dark, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether they kill or cure, muſt depend merely upon accident.</p>
               <p>Becoming a little eſtabliſhed in buſineſs, I conceived an idea of inventing a few noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trums. Being, as I before obſerved, a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar practitioner, I could not bear to behold a parcel of empiries lolling in their coaches; many of whom had been ſhoemakers, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths, or the moſt menial mechanics; I therefore uſhered into the world, with the greateſt diſpatch imaginable, a <hi>Cephalalgi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> or powder for the headach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a plaiſter for the deſtruction of corns. Thus, by laying a tax upon the two extremes of mankind, the head and the feet, I preſently found myſelf in a ſituation to enable me to imitate the other noſtrum mongers, and ſet up a mo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> elegant carriage.</p>
               <p>Encouraged by a ſeries of ſucceſsful events, I came to the reſolution of purchaſing a diploma, and be conſtituted in reality a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in medicine. I applied to the univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of A—, and for the moderate ſum of fourteen guineas, purchaſed as complete a diploma for that purpoſe, as could be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035084_0070_1000091BAFF5BD90"/>
at Oxford or Cambridge, by eleven years academical reſidence.</p>
               <p>Poſſeſſed of ſuch excellent materials for puffing, I got my diploma tranſlated into Engliſh, printed the ſubſtance of it on the papers which incloſed my noſtrums, and took ſuch other ſteps to acquaint the world with my real dignity, that I am now conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as one of the firſt phyſicians in the metropolis.</p>
               <p>I have projected ſome other general medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which will, in a ſhort time, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully preſented to the public. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, a lotion to promote dentition; an <hi>otalgiac</hi> powder for the cure of the <hi>earach</hi>; and a balſamic tincture for the <hi>heartach;</hi> the laſt of which I fear I muſt have recourſe to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, unleſs you condeſcend to notice this epiſtle, and expreſs a willingneſs to partake of my good fortune.</p>
               <p>I have forgot to obſerve to you, Madam, that I once had a ſpecific for the gout, which is the only article of mine that has not been attended with ſucceſs. It happened unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that, during the time of my advertiſing that medicine, I was laid up with a ſevere arthritic fit. This got wind, and my ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic became a mere drug; the public very judiciouſly obſerving, that, had I actually poſſeſſed an infallible remedy for ſuch an
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035084_0071_1000092422160F18"/>
excruciating diſorder, I certainly ſhould have found leiſure to adminiſter it to myſelf.</p>
               <p>The wiſeſt of us, Madam, are ſometimes off their guard; and, in that ſingle inſtance, I admit that my prudence was not properly diſplayed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I CONGRATULATE you, my Loui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſa, on your new acquiſition; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate the inhabitants in your vicinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on their having a man among them ſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of diſcerning merit, and ſo ſuſceptible of the tender paſſion under its proper influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>I am pleaſed at the encomiums you have beſtowed on your ingenuous ſwain; but the
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035084_0072_0FFFB54039ECDF68"/>
choice he has made is a ſufficient eulogium on him; a volume of panegyric cannot ſo effectually diſplay his taſte, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his diſcernment, as his taking the earlieſt opportunity of tendering his hand and heart to my Louiſa.</p>
               <p>The <hi>naivete</hi> and ſimplicity of his manner, on a firſt interview, are highly characteriſtic of his ſenſibility. Who could approach ſo much excellence, for the firſt time, without the greateſt agitation and perturbation of mind?—None but the ignorant and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different. But, according to your own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, how rapid were his advances from timidity to a proper degree of confidence, and from confidence to courage. He is indeed a jewel, and requires but little poliſhing.</p>
               <p>I am not diſpleaſed, Louiſa, that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Mr. Graham poſſeſſes a little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of your heart. You admit that he is not indifferent to you; and that you "expect," and even "<hi>hope,</hi>" that his ſecond viſit will not be long delayed.</p>
               <p>Ah! my deareſt girl, you muſt now be numbered among the wounded.—You muſt no longer declare yourſelf impregnable. Happy am I to find, however, that he who inflicted the wound, can adminiſter a cure; from him proceed the poiſon and the antidote.</p>
               <p>I am entirely of your opinion, Louiſa, that appearances are to be preſerved; for the malignant tongue of ſlander is ever voluble,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035084_0073_1000092973CA9738"/>
and where any action will admit of two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the worſt is ſure to be adopted.</p>
               <p>You doubtleſs expect a catalogue of thoſe lovers, who have made me a tender of their ſervices ſince my laſt. They would make collectively, a moſt excellent groupe, and furniſh great ſcope for the genius of a Bunbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The firſt upon the liſt is the moſt ill fated mortal that ever has exiſted ſince the days of Adam, and pleads his misfortunes as a kind of claim to my compaſſion; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what the poet has advanced—</p>
               <q>
                  <l>" Look into thoſe they call unfortunate,</l>
                  <l>" And cloſer view'd you'll find they are unwiſe,</l>
                  <l>" Some flaw in their own conduct lies beneath."</l>
               </q>
               <p>But, with all becoming deference to Dr. Young, this obſervation is more poetical than juſt. It comes, however, with propriety from the lips of an avaricious father, who recommends a fortunate lover to his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and pointedly exclaims againſt a ſuitor whom ſhe approves, merely on account of his misfortunes; though, in other reſpects, the former is much inferior to the latter.</p>
               <p>My next correſpondent is really a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant fellow. His letter extorted ſeveral hearty laughs from me in the peruſal of it. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the name of <hi>Stanza</hi> and mentions ſeveral literary productions in which he is an aſſiſtant. He ridicules, in a fine vein of
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035084_0074_1000092AF9E93200"/>
humor, the contrivances of the editors of newſpapers, to amuſe and entertain their readers. His ſatire on particular <hi>manoeuvres</hi> is equally juſt and entertaining, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected plan of a new paper, is mentioned with great pleaſantry.</p>
               <p>A Quaker is the next upon the liſt, who, after abuſing me in the affected ſtyle of that ridiculous tribe, clumſily offers to embelliſh his beaver with a button, rather than not be admitted one of the candidates for my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>A Baronet, preſuming on his title, attacks me with ſome effrontery; but I ſhall treat him with the negligence he merits.</p>
               <p>An Undertaker next addreſſes me, who, from his own diſcription of himſelf, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an original character. I may, perhaps, condeſcend to anſwer his letter, and appoint an interview; but it will be only to afford amuſement for the hour.</p>
               <p>A Quack Doctor is, to me, a moſt deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able character; and the epiſtle which I have received from one of that deſcription, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms me in the opinion I have always enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of that baneful fraternity. He has meanly purchaſed of the mercenary college of A—, a doctor's diploma, the better to enable him to proceed upon his medical farce, and impoſe upon mankind. It was well ſaid by a certain wag, ſpeaking of that
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035084_0075_1000092DB2788070"/>
univerſity, that though it was poor now, it would get rich by <hi>degrees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have this day received a viſit from one of my epiſtolary candidates, in conſequence of a permiſſion under my ſign manual. It was my clerical ſuitor, Mr. Proby; and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he appears to be in all reſpects, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Taking example by you my Louiſa, I ſhall relate the converſation that paſt between us, according to the beſt of my recollection, by way of dialogue.</p>

                  <p>I think myſelf particularly honored, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, by the partial ſelection you have made in my favor, among a multiplicity of ſuitors who have doubtleſs troubled you with their addreſſes.

                  <p>That your remonſtrances proceeded from the beſt of motives, is not to be doubted; and they came with ſingular propriety from a gentleman of your cloth. The ſtep I have taken, will be ſuppoſed, by many, to be the effect of levity, and deſerving of the ſevereſt reprehenſion; but, be aſſured, Sir, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was perfectly inoffenſive; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aſperſions this conduct of mine may have drawn upon me, I prefer my honor to

               </sp>
               <p>Such, my Louiſa, was the converſation between me and my young ſprig of divinity; when, after a few compliments of courſe, he bowed and took his leave.</p>
               <p>He is really a very handſome fellow; and, had he not quite ſo much gravity and formality, would ſtand very forward in my eſteem. But, like your timid lover, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him to improve, and ſhould not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at finding him a perfect rattle after he has received two or three audiences.</p>
               <p>Should he happen to be the man of my choice, promotion in the church may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for him upon very moderate terms. Other genteel and lucrative employments,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035084_0079_0FFFB547E6B27A98"/>
are purchaſed at a more extravagant rate, becauſe they are ſuitable to every man; but eccleſiaſtical preferments can be enjoyed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by eccleſiaſtics.</p>
               <p>His having no fortune is not diſpleaſing to me, as I have ſufficient of my own. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, my uncle is the patron of a living of five hundred a year, and the preſent incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent is upwards of eighty. This is no very diſtant proſpect; and I know I can procure it for him without any difficulty.</p>
               <p>You requeſted a long epiſtle from me, and ſo far you certainly are gratified; but whether it will contribute to your amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or information, is a matter which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes my hopes and fears.</p>
               <p>A new comedy has juſt appeared at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Garden theatre. A Baronet's lady <hi>confeſſes</hi> herſelf the author of it; but ſhe has not acquired that reputation from it which ſhe expected. It abounds with indelicate alluſions, and <hi>double entendres</hi> bordering on obſcenity. It is to be lamented that the ladies have taken greater latitudes than the men in theſe particulars; eſpecially thoſe who have figured in the dramatic walk; as Mrs. <hi>Behn,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Centlivre,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Cowley,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>YOU encourage me, Belinda, by your encomiums on my lover, to cheriſh a partiality in his favor. He is indeed a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable youth, and daily advances in my eſteem. Permit me, however, to thank you, in the ſtrongeſt terms, for your extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry compliment, in eſtimating Mr. Graham's
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:035084_0081_1000094402E35D58"/>
abilities by the judicious choice he had made.</p>
               <p>I thank you for the ſupplemental cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of your ſuitors—What a curious groupe! May you ſelect, from ſuch a med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of characters, a perſon worthy of you! May your young ſprig of divinity, bloom forth, and become a reſpectable branch!— You certainly have a penchant for him; and, if you can overlook his deficiency of fortune, in other reſpects he appears to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a preference in your eſteem.</p>
               <p>After entreaties many times repeated, I conſented to accompany my ſwain to his father's houſe, where elegance and hoſpital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity appeared conſpicuous. I was received and entertained like a divinity, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Mr. Graham's ſiſter, a young lady of moſt amiable manners, but had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely treated by that mercileſs deſtroyer of fine faces, the ſmall pox. She was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſhed, ſang well, played delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the harpſichord, and was inimitably excellent in various kinds of needle work.</p>
               <p>After paſſing a moſt agreeable day, I was conducted home by my ſwain, in his phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. On my return, we had a <hi>tete a tete</hi>; when I received further proofs of the ſincerity of his profeſſions, and the amiableneſs of his diſpoſition in the following converſation.</p>

                  <p>To convince you, my dear Madam, that I am not a mercenary lover, I will not even aſk you the amount of your fortune, or whether you have any at all; and to prove the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of my paſſion beyond the power of words, I freely and voluntarily offer to make ſuch a ſettlement on you as you ſhall deſire, conſiſtent with my preſent poſſeſſions, which are indeed very conſiderable.</p>

                  <p>But ſhould you hereafter alter your opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and think you have purchaſed me at too dear a rate, you will then repent of having taken ſo inconſiderate a ſtep, and wonder at your folly.</p>

                  <speaker>MR GRAHAM.</speaker>
                  <p>Never, Madam, never. Louiſa is too cheaply purchaſed with all that I am poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of; which, thank heaven! is a clear two thouſand pounds a year.

                  <p>Your humble opinion of yourſelf my dear Madam, enhances your perfections.— With a modeſt diffidence, you ſeem inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your own attractions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though they are acknowledged and approved by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring world.</p>

                  <p>Little did I expect, in this remote corner of the world, to have met with ſo much honor, generoſity, and politeneſs. But virtue is the growth of every clime. Even the ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile regions of the north, have produced a man the moſt amiable that I have ever ſeen.</p>

                  <speaker>LOUISA.</speaker>
                  <p>But can it be ſuppoſed that your venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble father would conſent to your beſtowing your hand on ſo improper an object? Can it be poſſible that he ſhould not object to your union with a woman without a fortune, when there are many in affluence who would think themſelves happy to receive your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures?</p>

                  <speaker>MR. GRAHAM.</speaker>
                  <p>My father is no ſtranger to your perſon and deſerts. The old gentleman is almoſt

                  <p>Deliberation, Madam, appears unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but your will ſhall ever be a law to me, as ſacred as the ſtatutes of the Medes and Perſians, irrevocable!—But, afford me ſome conſolation.—Permit me to hope that you will not abandon me.</p>

Excuſe me, Sir, but, were I ever ſo much inclined to liſten to your propoſals, delicacy, and even decency, requires a reſerved conduct on a treaty of this nature, from a woman who wiſhes to eſcape the cenſures of the world.

               <p>You ſee how impatient and how importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate he is to have the connubial rites per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, which are indiſſolubly to unite our fates: You ſee with what difficulty I have obtained a reſpite of only a ſingle month.

               <p>You may imagine, my dear Belinda, by my raving, that the little winged deity has pointed his arrow at my breaſt, and has pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrated it at leaſt ſkin deep. Indeed I feel myſelf vulnerable, and can no longer boaſt of my inſenſibility; which you know, Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa, I have often done in your preſence; but I had not then ſeen Mr. Graham.</p>
               <p>Poſitively, Belinda, I think I ſhall be married before you. My ſpark has no

My mind has been ſo much agitated, as to diſqualify me for a mere narrator of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon circumſtances and events.</p>
               <p>But—Mr. Graham is arrived!—I ſee the dear youth entering at the gate!—Excuſe me then, Belinda, for abruptly concluding my epiſtle—Next to Mr. Graham I prefer my dear Belinda to all the world; and ſhe muſt pardon me for the exception.

               <p>Oh! my Louiſa, what have I endured in the preſence of that Hibernian monſter! When I permitted, or rather invited, him to come, I thought he would entertain me a little with his abſurdity, and that I could get rid of him at pleaſure; but I ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my error, and was ſo alarmed and ſhocked at his behavior, that I knew not how to act. At length, by ſoothing him, and complying, in ſome reſpects, with his humor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the brute thought proper to depart; and I ſhall take ſpecial care<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by changing my place of reſidence, that he never ſhall be able to pay me a ſecond viſit, except on the thirtyfirſt day of February, according to my jocular appointment.</p>
               <p>This adventure, Louiſa, will almoſt deter me from permitting any of my other candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates to approach me, except the clerical ſtripling which I have already ſeen. He is, indeed, a youth of amiable manners and diſpoſition, and one for whom I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a great eſteem; as I have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you.</p>
               <p>But, notwithſtanding the inſults I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from MacGregor, and the terror I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured leſt he ſhould proceed to diſagreeable extremities. I am half inclined to give an audience to Mr. Stanza; a character which

I mentioned to you in one of my epiſtles. If I can form any judgment from his letter, he is perfectly inoffenſive; and as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to know the world, I doubt not but he will be entertaining.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I THANK you, my Belinda, for the three days which you have cut off between me and happineſs. As you predicted I gave the hint, and the worthy youth improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:035084_0099_10000826CAD262C0"/>I trembled for you, when I peruſed the dialogue between you and MacGregor, and could perceive, from your cautious and guarded anſwers to his inſolence and abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, that you were much terrified. From your deſcription of the fellow in a former letter, I thought him abſurd and inoffenſive; but it appears, upon trial, that he is a ſtrange mixture of malignity and whim. His ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms terrify me, but his abſurd oddities divert me. Never ſuffer him to approach you more.</p>
               <p>You muſt be expeditious, or I ſhall ſet you an example, inſtead of waiting to be a follower. My aunt with whom I have now taken up my reſidence, and who is my near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt relation now living, highly approves and encourages the propoſed match, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſuch an alliance would be, in all reſpects, honorable and advantageous to our family.</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham has no idea of my having any fortune; but I mean to ſurpriſe him, by preſenting it to him on the day that our nuptials are celebrated. I think I need not now inform you how much it is, having, I well remember, already mentioned the ſum to you. Inſtead of three thouſand pounds, would it were fifty.</p>
               <p>I flatter myſelf that Mr. Graham will not have made an improper or diſadvantageous
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035084_0100_0FFFB5064C3415A0"/>
match, when all expectancies are taken into conſideration. My aunt's fortune is very conſiderable, and I am her next heir; but, what is ſtill of greater conſequence, I am her only favorite.</p>
               <p>How ſolid, ſerious and thoughtful am I grown, ſince I have formed a reſolution of altering my condition. Upon all manner of ſubjects. I debate with as much formality and ſeeming ſagacity as my aunt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate on the conſequences that may prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enſue in certain ſituations.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I am ceaſing to be girliſh, and am willing to put on the woman, in every acceptation of the word. Be not ſurpriſed, therefore my Belinda, at the gravity of my future epiſtles.</p>
               <p>I had a moſt delightful <hi>tete a tete,</hi> yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day evening, with my amiable ſuitor. If poſſible, he every ſucceſſive day appears more worthy of my eſteem, I had almoſt ſaid of my warmeſt affections.

                  <p>In her you have a ſtrong advocate Mr. Graham. Her advice and ſolicitations have much accelerated the concluſion of this treaty. It is therefore probable that ſhe would recommend a compliance with your terms, provided I did not throw in a caveat againſt them.</p>

                  <p>Now, my Louiſa, I rank myſelf among the happieſt of mankind. From this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I ſhall conſider our faith as <hi>plighted</hi> to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035084_0103_10000836AB8EBDD8"/>
each other, and that we actually are (cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony excepted) cemented by the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted tie, the union of hearts. I ſhall make immediate application to ſome gentlemen of the bar, to prepare a proper ſettlement for my Louiſa, in which blanks ſhall be left open to be filled up at her diſcretion; for I deteſt the idea of ſtipulating with a woman I adore. She knows the extent of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and ſhe ſhall have uncontroled liberty to make ſuch a proviſion for herſelf as ſhe ſhall approve. I have only to add, that nothing will give me more diſpleaſure than to ſhew an illtimed delicacy upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. It will imply a doubt that I am not actuated by the moſt generous principles, and that my liberality is not as unbounded as my love.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>LOUISA.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Sir, it you ſuppoſe me actuated by the ſame principles, and ſuch a ſuppoſition would be but doing me juſtice, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline every act that would pronounce a mercenary diſpoſition. If you, to convince me of your affection and generoſity, are lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral to exceſs; my acceptance of ſuch lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erality, would betray a want of affection in me, and a ſordid ungenerous mind. Beſides I have too high an idea of your probity and virtue, to ſuppoſe that you can ever ſubmit to act diſhonorably, merely becauſe there are
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035084_0104_100008401173C9E8"/>
not ſkins of parchment to oblige you to a contrary conduct. In ſhort, Mr. Graham, I cannot prevail upon myſelf to agree to the humiliating terms which you have offered. I have a ſpirit as liberal as your own, and, if I have not affluence to enable me to confer favors, I have the generoſity to refuſe them, when they are preſented to me unmerit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Your arguments, my deareſt girl, are too refined. I admire the nobleneſs of your diſpoſition, and the delicacy of your feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But conſider how infinitely I am your debtor, and how inadequate my whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is, to make any thing like a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſo much beauty and perfection.</p>

                  <p>No, it certainly was to his advantage; for he was a gainer by the tranſaction. But I ſhall hereafter pay little attention to his doctrine: Precept, when not ſupported by

                  <p>This pariſh, you know, is pretty extenſive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as Mr. Norton, our rector, was taking a ride near a remote corner of it, a ſudden ſhower of rain obliged him to ſeek for ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; a poor female cottager, ſeeing his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, invited him into her humble manſion. He accepted her invitation, ſeated himſelf by the fire, and after many earneſt entreaties from the poor but hoſpitable dame partook of a raſher of her bacon. Mr. Norton's horſe was, at the ſame time, conducted to a hovel, rubbed down, and plentifully refreſhed with hay and corn. Whilſt this reverend cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman was ſo cheerfully and generouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the good hoſteſs, he obſerved, through a window which opened into a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle orchard at the back part of the houſe, a ſow attended by ſeveral pigs; and the pigs
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035084_0106_100008431AA18910"/>
were juſt of a proper age for the ſpit: Struck by ſo tempting an appearance, his reverence aſked the honeſt cottager if the ſow and pigs belonged to her? She anſwered in the affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative, when he humanely told her he was entitled to one of thoſe pigs and ſhould ſend his ſervant for it in the afternoon. The dame pleaded a large family, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme difficulty of providing for it; and concluded with entreating him to forego his claim. The doctor was not to be diſſuaded from his purpoſe, he was peremptory in his demand, and actually ſent for the pig as he had threatened.</p>

               <p>Is not Mr. Graham one of the worthieſt of his ſex? Can I be blamed for acceding ſo expeditiouſly to his terms?—To the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer queſtion, I know, you will anſwer in the affirmative, and to the latter in the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative.

               <p>I WOULD adviſe you to advertiſe yourſelf for ſale to the beſt bidder; you would find it a much better method of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of yourſelf than that which you have adopted. I am a ſworn broker and auction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eer, and ſhould be glad to be employed for that purpoſe. You may be ſold by <hi>hand,</hi> by <hi>candle,</hi> or by <hi>auction,</hi> according to your own election. I ſhould be happy to <hi>put you up,</hi> as I doubt not that you are a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and will fetch a handſome price. But, to prevent your being <hi>knocked down</hi> for a mere trifle, we muſt engage a few puffers.</p>
               <p>It will be neceſſary, however, that, for three or four days previous to the ſale, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſhould be given in the public prints,

               <p>It will be equally neceſſary that a ſtriking deſcription of your perſon ſhould be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and circulated in all the Coffeehouſes. I am particularly celebrated for diſplaying articles to advantage, and for exciting the attention and curioſity of the public.

She is as beautiful as the Venus de Medicis, as chaſte as Lucretia, and as accompliſhed as Minerva.

The remainder on the execution of the conveyance, which will be prepared with all convenient diſpatch.

               <p>Something ſimilar to the above, with prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er variations according to the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cannot fail of calling forth the attention of the curious, who will probably be anxious to become purchaſers.</p>
               <p>I ſhall charge only five <hi>per cent</hi> commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, including the advertiſements and other incidental expences. Terms ſo very mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate cannot ſurely be objected to, eſpecially as the eſtate is only perſonal.</p>
               <p>Being a bachelor, I ſhall have no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to treat with you privately for the lot; but if you are determined to have it decided by the <hi>candle</hi> or the <hi>hammer,</hi> I truſt you will give me the preference.

But, I hate to be my own panegyriſt.

               </head>
               <p>PREPARE yourſelf, Belinda, for a moſt alarming tale! How uncertain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecure are the pleaſures and bleſſings of this life!—I, who but a few days ago thought myſelf the happieſt of mortals, and that joy and bliſs would conſtantly await me, have been plunged into the moſt agonizing and unutterable diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>On Monday laſt, Mr. Graham paſſed the evening with me, and did not depart till it was unuſually late. Finding the night advanced beyond his expectation, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to keep his ſervants from their reſt, inſtead of walking, he ran home, This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035084_0113_100008719B0D6658"/>
being more violent than what he had been accuſtomed to, a violent perſpiration enſued, and after that a ſwimming in the head. The beſt medical advice that could be procured in that country, was obtained the next morning. The doctor pronounced the malady a malignant fever, and of that dangerous kind, that he could not flatter the ſorrowful attendants; with any hopes of his recovery.</p>
               <p>Think, my Belinda, of the ſhock I muſt have ſuſtained, on receiving ſuch direful intelligence. I haſtened to his aſſiſtance, and adminiſtered to him all the comfort and conſolation in my poor power. Growing worſe every ſucceeding day, he expected a ſpeedy diſſolution, which, with tears in his eyes, he lamented, becauſe it would ſever him, he ſaid, from his dear Louiſa.</p>
               <p>My concern for his ſituation, which was too poignant to be concealed, affected him much. The tenderneſs of his expreſſions but added to my affliction. He appeared, if poſſible, more amiable to me now than ever! But the thought of loſing him planted dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in my breaſt.</p>
               <p>The phyſician, thinking his recovery not only doubtful, but almoſt impoſſible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted he would ſettle his affairs. The dear youth, with apparent reſignation, gave
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:035084_0114_10000879B9CA0D58"/>
inſtructions for his will, which was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly prepared and executed.</p>
               <p>Permit me to add, my Belinda, that I was the firſt legatee named in this laſt teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He bequeathed me a thouſand pounds a year, and a ſum of two thouſand pounds to be paid me immediately after his deceaſe.</p>
               <p>This additional proof of the ſtrength of his attachment to me, quite overcame me; I ſwooned, and fell ſenſeleſs on the floor. The alarm occaſioned by this accident, ſtruck Mr. Graham like electricity. In ſpite of the violence of his diſeaſe, he roſe in his bed, and wanted to come to my aſſiſtance, but the attendants prudently withheld him. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion both of mind and body on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, produced a criſis to his diſeaſe; from that moment, he gradually recovered, and is, now thank heaven! perfectly reſtored to health.</p>
               <p>It may be neceſſary to obſerve, that, after my ſwoon, I was taken from the floor and conveyed to a bed in an adjacent room; nor was it till the afternoon of the next day, that my ſenſes were returned.</p>
               <p>But, as ſoon as reaſon reaſſumed her throne, I enquired, with fear and terror, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my dear youth, and had the exalted hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to be informed, that his recovery had been ſo rapid, that he was pronounced out of
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035084_0115_1000088534F52100"/>
danger. The moſt enchanting muſic could not have ſo delighted my ears, as the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly accents which conveyed to me the bleſſed intelligence!</p>
               <p>I ran to the dear idol of my ſoul to have this viſion realized, for I ſtill dreaded that it was all deluſion! But, (bleſſed be the Gods) the joyful news was true. As ſoon as he beheld me, he greeted me with a benign ſmile, expreſſive of the ſweetneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency of his nature, and of the pleaſure he enjoyed in ſeeing me. I fell on my knees and thanked Heaven for his recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery!</p>
               <p>It was a delightful embarraſſment that I experienced! Gratitude, affection, joy, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately were my ruling paſſions. It al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt aſtoniſhes me that my poor weak frame could ſupport me under ſuch a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tranſports!</p>
               <p>In a few days Mr. Graham's health was perfectly reinſtated, and, with it, the roſy hue which embelliſhes his manly cheek.— Pardon me, my Belinda, if I expreſs myſelf too warmly upon this intereſting buſineſs— To be cool and tranquil upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, would certainly be criminal! I feel myſelf too much elevated to be a mere nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator. My tranſition from wretchedneſs to happineſs, was as ſudden, as it was unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:035084_0116_10000890535F7CE8"/>But, let me ſuffer my raptures, for the preſent, to ſubſide. Remember, my dear Belinda, you are now two epiſtles in my debt. It is a debt of honor, and I expect to have it immediately diſcharged; but let it be at two ſeparate payments, by two ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive mails.</p>
               <p>During my tortures and diſtreſs, I hope you, and your man of the gown, have had a ſecond interview. Nothing tragic, I hope, has befallen you, in your extenſive line, as a lover—nothing that has given you uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or alarm—for really, my Belinda, your mode of courtſhip is not without its dangers and inconveniences.</p>
               <p>I am this moment going to take and air<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with my dear man: The phaeton is waiting for us, therefore, for the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,</p>

               <head>LETTER XXV. <hi>BELINDA BLACKET,</hi> to <hi>LOUISA LENOX.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>YOU expect from me Louiſa, a letter of condolence and congratulation. I am extremely ſorry for the ſufferings you have endured, and I felicitate you on your relief from thoſe ſufferings. Your tender boſom muſt have been greatly agitated by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conflicts it has experienced; but I hope the ſevereſt trials are paſt, and that perfect tranquility may be ſpeedily reſtored; for even the moſt pleaſing paſſions of the ſoul, whilſt they delight, do injury.</p>
               <p>But, my Louiſa, your delicate feelings are too ſuſceptible—You have too much ſympathiſing goodneſs, to taſte tranquility when you behold others racked with torture or diſappointment.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the ſeverity of your late ſufferings, you rally me, with your uſual pleaſantry, on my young divine. Rally on, my Louiſa! ſhould you mention him in every line, you will not diſpleaſe me.</p>
               <l>—"Take him for all in all</l>
               <l>I ne'er ſhall look upon his like again."</l>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="unknown:035084_0118_1000089C49605460"/>More than once or twice ſince I laſt wrote to you, have I ſeen Mr. Proby; and I find him the moſt agreeable, the moſt deſerving man I ever knew. He has<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed, ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted himſelf in my affections, that I fear (or rather hope) he is not to be eradicated.</p>
               <p>I abandon the thoughts of all my other correſpondents. The grave ones cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe me, nor the ridiculous ones divert me. Indeed, as I hinted to you, I ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned my undertaker to appear before me, but he diſappointed my expectations. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of finding him a man of wit and whim, as I expected from his epiſtle, he was a pert, ſolemn coxcomb, as dull as he was pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. Stanzy was humorous and agreeable, and really entertained me much.</p>
               <p>At preſent, however, Mr. Proby wholly occupies my thoughts. His perſon is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, his addreſs pleaſing, his character ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproachable; and though he modeſtly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed that circumſtance, in the letter he honored me with, he is allied to a family of rank and great reſpectability.</p>
               <p>I flatter myſelf that he entertains a <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant</hi> for me; nay, I am convinced of it. He has even made propoſals to me in form, and I liſtened to them with reſpect. In ſhort, we ſeem to be in a regular train, and advancing, ſtep by ſtep, to the hymeneal altar. I wiſh our proceedings were leſs
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:035084_0119_100008A29C9830C0"/>
gradual, and like yours, haſtening to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py concluſion.</p>
               <p>Luckily, the rectory is now vacant of which my uncle has the advowſen; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the right of preſentation. I have acquainted that worthy relation of mine, with the overtures I have received from Mr. Proby, but without mentioning the origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cauſe; and he perfectly approves of him, after a minute inveſtigation of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and connexions. He has even promiſed, as an addition to my fortune, to preſent my intended to the living in his diſpoſal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided an union ſhould take place between us.</p>
               <p>This generous offer I have communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my reverened ſwain; which was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gratifying to him, as it teſtified my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in the moſt unequivocal terms, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on him my hand.</p>
               <p>Still, however, he laments that his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo inadequate to mine, and expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es his fears that I ſhould hereafter look on him in the light of an adventurer or fortune hunter. Though I approve of the delicacy of his obſervations, I endeavor to diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſuch ſuggeſtions.</p>
               <p>I doubt not of his ſincerity, when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures me, as he often does in the moſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive terms that he ſhould be happy to become mine, though I did not poſſeſs a ſhilling in
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:035084_0120_100008AF4E29FDE8"/>
the world; not doubting but his endeavors would at leaſt procure a competence and happineſs.</p>
               <p>He wiſhes to ſettle the whole of my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which you know is conſiderable, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on myſelf; but I reprobate ſuch an idea; ſcorning to act a mercenary part with a man of ſo liberal a diſpoſition, and a man who, I am convinced, loves me for myſelf alone.</p>
               <p>He candidly acknowledges that at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, his chief clerical emoluments ariſe from a ſmall curacy; and excluſive of that, he has only a fellowſhip in St. John's college, Oxford, which of courſe, terminates with his marriage.—But, what of that! He is a gentleman, in its moſt extenſive acceptation, and, with a due eſtimation of his merits, I think him my ſuperior.</p>
               <p>Your opinion, my Louiſa, upon a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this importance, would be acceptable; and yet, if it did not concur with mine, I believe I ſhould reject it; but, if it ſhould, as I know you would give it me ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it would afford me infinite ſatisfaction, and encourage me to proceed. At all events, however, favor me with your ſentiments.</p>
               <p>Though I am happy at having procured, by my advertiſement, one worthy man, I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I have expoſed myſelf to the ſneers and inſults of the malignant and the
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:035084_0121_100008BA5296D1D0"/>
vulgar. In addition to the catalogue of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters, which I have already given you, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent auctioneer has had the audacity to ſend me a letter, replete with deriſion and vulgarity. He impudently offers, his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to fell me by <hi>hand,</hi> by <hi>auction,</hi> or by <hi>inch of candle.</hi> Thank heaven theſe infamous fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows know nothing of me, but my chriſtian name!</p>
               <p>It pleaſes me exceedingly, my Louiſa, that my uncle ſo well approves of the man of my choice; and he approves of him from a conviction of his deſerts. Had there been a blemiſh in the character or conduct of Mr. Proby, my uncle's penetration would have diſcovered it; but they have ſtood the teſt of the ſevereſt examination, and he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced immaculate.</p>
               <p>You will perhaps accuſe me of incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency; and indeed, with juſtice you may accuſe me: But indulgencies are allowable to perſons in my ſituation—I had almoſt ſaid to lovers. Though intent upon one object, they ramble from circumſtance to circumſtance, that ultimately tend to the ſame point.</p>
               <p>I fear you will think me tedious, my Louiſa; but, on ſo intereſting a theme, you muſt excuſe my prolixity. Our caſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are ſomewhat ſimilar, and no difficulty can occur in framing excuſes for each other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:035084_0122_100008C0143E4FE0"/>In one of your epiſtles, you mentioned purling ſtreams, enamelled meadows, and amaranthine bowers. From ſuch a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of your abilities, as a paſtoral writer, I expected ſoon to have received from you ſome pictureſque deſcription of the enviable ſtate of happy lovers, interchanging vows beneath the fragrant jeſſamine, or breathing tender tales in a foreſt of woodbines; whilſt the harmony of the feathered choir, as if celebrating the natal day of ſome neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhepherdeſs, adds dignity and ſimplicity to the ſcene.</p>
               <p>Are you not ſurpriſed, Louiſa, that an inhabitant of the metropolis, like myſelf, pent up within the bills of mortality, ſhould be able to form even a tolerable idea of rural matters? But all lovers delight in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral proſpects and deſcriptions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Proby is this inſtant arrived; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuffer me to take my leave,</p>

               <head>LETTER XXVI. <hi>BELINDA BLACKET,</hi> to <hi>LOUISA LENOX.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE laſt poſt conveyed an epiſtle from Belinda to her friend Louiſa; the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent mail contains diſpatches from the ſame correſpondent, and to the ſame reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friend.</p>
               <p>Wonder not Louiſa, that I did not wait till I had received your anſwer to my laſt before I impoſed another heavy taſk upon you. I hinted to you in the poſt ſcript, that another large packet of letters had arrived from my diſperſed lovers; but I have ſome further particulars to mention with regard to my new wooers. Not many of them are inhabitants of London, or its environs; many of them, indeed, reſide at a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable diſtance from the metropolis, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the place whence they are dated, as well as from the corroborating poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</p>
               <p>That theſe billets did not arrive ſooner, is eaſily accounted for: Some days muſt have elapſed before the newſpaper, in which
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035084_0124_100008E306631220"/>
my advertiſement appeared, could have been circulated over the diſtant counties; a further delay muſt have been required, to enable my rural adorers to pen one of their beſt epiſtles; and no inconſiderable time was neceſſary to convey them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective towns and villages, to the grand centre of correſpondence and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Upwards of one hundred and fifty propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals have I received by the general poſt, all franked by the payment of the poſtage; the revenue will therefore be ſomewhat enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in conſequence of my ſingular project.</p>
               <p>Had I not proceeded ſo far with Mr. Proby, I might doubtleſs have made a prudent choice among theſe new candidates.—Many of them appear to be comfortably ſituated, and independent; others candidly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſly ſtate their difficulties, as well as their proſpects; but moſt of them exhibit ſtrong <hi>traits</hi> of integrity and honor. To enable you to judge of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my London and country correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, I have encloſed thoſe diſpatches, which ſeem moſt to claim attention. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of my London declarations of love, you are already in poſſeſſion of.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ENCOURAGED by your addreſs to the public, I have ventured as an individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of that public to offer you my devoirs.— Suppoſing you in earneſt, I take the liberty of informing you, that I am as willing as yourſelf to alter my condition.</p>
               <p>I flatter myſelf that you can have no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to my ſituation; as I am far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from poverty, and rather border up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on affluence. I have an eſtate of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty pounds a year, which I keep in my own hands, and manage in the moſt advantageous manner that I am able. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own landlord, my ſtock or movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles can never be diſtrained for rent, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which affords me no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſolation.</p>
               <p>But, though the ſoil is my own, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts principally of grazing land, ſome money
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035084_0126_100009000E0C11C0"/>
is neceſſary to enable me to ſtock it as it ought to be. If I cannot purchaſe ſheep and cattle to be fattened on that land, the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which I ſhall derive from it will not ſupport me, and much leſs a family: I am therefore inclined to think that your money, joined to my eſtate would place ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing upon a proper footing, and enable us to live comfortably and genteely. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, however, you may think differently: If you do, I muſt look out for ſome other worthy woman, who has got a few hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds.</p>
               <p>Till we agree about pecuniary conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I would not wiſh to have an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view. I am ſo ſenſible of the influence of beauty againſt my ſtrongeſt reſolutions, that all my cautions and ſtipulations muſt be exerciſed during the epiſtolary treaty.</p>
               <p>Having mentioned my poſſeſſions, you will perhaps expect ſome account of my perſon, and ſuch other particulars as are uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually the topics of inveſtigation, previous to an union of hands and fortunes.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſend my picture, as my figure has never been delineated by a Reynolds, a Gainſborough, or any other artiſt. The following, however, are the genuine out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of my perſon, for I never flattered any man: I am rough and unpoliſhed, as you may well imagine, having received my ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035084_0127_1000090C86E65B80"/>
among the fens in Lincolnſhire. I am juſt now entering my twentyfifth year; am about five feet eight inches in height; and rather thin than corpulent. I have a homely country face, with a dark brown head of hair, unfaſhioned by the hands of the frizzeur.</p>
               <p>To you it may ſeem extraordinary that I cannot make a proper matrimonial connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion in my own country. Though this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation might naturally occur to many perſons, yet in this part of the world it is not applicable; except abſolute paupers, here are but two claſſes of women, the rich and the middling. By the former I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as infinitely their inferior, and any overtures of marriage made to any of them, would be pronounced an inſult not to be forgiven; though, perhaps, in point of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, I am equal with the greater part of them. To the other claſs, my pride will not ſuffer me to deſcend, as I ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy with a woman wholly unaccompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I would wiſh her to poſſeſs a cultivated mind.</p>
               <p>That you are an object of attraction, I cannot doubt: With a becoming modeſty, you acknowledge it. If you think me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to your ſlighteſt notice, favor we with a line, to which I will render due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:035084_0128_0FFFB53D50AC3FE0"/>I muſt do myſelf the juſtice to declare, that, though I am a plodding farmer, I have had the education of a gentleman. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is not given from motives of vanity, but to convince you that an alliance with me will be leſs a degradation to your family.</p>

               <p>ACCEPT of me as a correſpondent, in anſwer to your alluring advertiſement. To ſhew what pretentions I have to a pref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence in your choice, it may be neceſſary to mention who and what I am. That taſk, however, will be attended with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, as I hardly know who and what I am myſelf, having been in ſuch a variety of ſituations, during the ſhort period that I have exiſted.</p>
               <p>Having been pretty liberally educated, I was firſt apprenticed to a ſurgeon in the country; but I had too much timidity and tenderneſs in my diſpoſition to arrive at any degree of eminence in that butcherly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; I therefore quitted it, and engaged in a trade equally ſanguinary. My father purchaſed a pair of colors for me in a marching regiment, and with my ſcarlet uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035084_0131_1000093F1A364FD8"/>
epaulette, and flaming cockade, I cut a moſt tremendous figure.</p>
               <p>Feeling the conſequence of a military character, I ſometimes ventured to hector and bluſter, among thoſe whom I ſuppoſed had not a ſufficient ſhare of ſpirit to call me to an account for my inſolent behavior. For a long time I enjoyed the reputation of valor, and was in hopes that no one would ever put my courage to the teſt. At length, however, I received a formal challenge, from a young gentleman whom I had inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I did not feel myſelf bold.</p>
               <p>I condeſcended to aſk pardon in the moſt humiliating terms, but my petition was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with contempt. What was to be done? I knew myſelf poſſeſſed of a natural mildneſs of diſpoſition, and could not bear the thoughts of drawing blood from any human creature. I remonſtrated with my antagoniſt, who alſo bore the king's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, on the impropriety of expoſing two military lives to danger, in conſequence of a fooliſh private quarrel, when there was an appearance of their ſervices being ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily required, to chaſtiſe the inſolence of the enemies of their country.</p>
               <p>Theſe arguments, inſtead of abating, rouſed the rage of my challenger; he grew bold, in proportion as I exhibited ſigns of fear and trepidation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:035084_0132_10000950D7A17428"/>He threatened to poſt me for a coward, if I would not meet him at a certain hour in Hyde Park; adding, that I might rely on finding him and his ſecond there at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time.</p>
               <p>Not wiſhing to purchaſe honor at the riſque of my life, I ſoon came to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how to conduct myſelf in this buſineſs. I knew that, if I refuſed to fight my man, my military profeſſion was no longer tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Inſtead of meeting the hero and his ſecond, I went to a proper agent to find a purchaſer for my commiſſion.</p>
               <p>My commiſſion having been bought, I was permitted to diſpoſe of it; but had it been given me, no ſuch indulgence would have been permitted; I muſt have reſigned with infamy.</p>
               <p>I was not greatly chagrined at this occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Finding that a man of a forgiving turn of mind, was a deſpicable character a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſoldiers, I was determined to enter into a line of life, where a man might dare to be a coward without becoming infamous. My next ſtep was to qualify for the church. A few leſſons from an old clergyman, with whom my father was acquainted, enabled me to rub up my Latin and Greek, and I found no great difficulty in getting ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:035084_0133_100009525C3D04E8"/>Here I indulged my talent for declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without control, and without danger of murder or aſſaſſination. I declared inſtant war againſt Satan and his miniſters; and made it, for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>e time, my whole ſtudy to blacken thoſe characters, though they never had offended me. I knew myſelf perfectly ſafe, in this kind of ſcandal and abuſe, as I had no apprehenſions of a ſummons to Hyde Park.</p>
               <p>My ſalary as a curate, for I never had either rectory or vicarage, was about equal to the pay I had received as an enſign; and I had ſome caſual extra fees on performing certain ceremonies annexed to my clerical function. I now thought myſelf happy and independant; but, hearing that many clerical gentlemen had worked themſelves into a good fat living by abuſing the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I ſet to work immediately; and, if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe is worthy of a reward in proportion to its rancor, I ought at leaſt to have had a mitre.</p>
               <p>I proved that there was not a man of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity or underſtanding in the cabinet; that the biſhops had no charity, and the maids of honor no chaſtity; and that neither our admirals or generals could endure the ſmell of gunpowder.</p>
               <p>Not thinking I had gone far enough to be noticed, I even ſcandalized a few princes.
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035084_0134_10000956094E33C0"/>
This indeed occaſioned my ſtrictures to be attended to, and I was promoted to—a place in Newgate. An information was moved againſt me for defamation: I was arraigned for having publiſhed a fal<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> ſcandalous and ſeditious libel; and though I attempted a juſtification, and to prove the truth of what I had aſſerted, I was found guilty; It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, indeed, in the courſe of the trial, that, could I have proved the truth of every ſyllable which I had advanced, I ſhould have been equally culpable; it being a maxim in law, that "a libel is not the leſs a libel for being true."</p>
               <p>It would not have become me to contend with my judges; therefore, as a means of mitigating damages, I urged the plea of poverty; no man could have ſee forth ſuch a plea with more propriety than myſelf, for my little all was diſtributed in fees among the black gentlemen in Weſtminſter Hall. My whole <hi>perſonal</hi> eſtate (and I had nothing <hi>real</hi>) did not at that time amount to more than nineteen pence three farthings.</p>
               <p>Having proved myſelf a pauper, by affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit, I thought I was perfectly ſecure from having any pecuniary penalties impoſed upon me; but when I reflected on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſubſtituting impriſonment for fine, I felt myſelf a little uneaſy. Imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:035084_0135_1000095B98964408"/>
preſented the word NEWGATE before my eyes, in very large legible characters.</p>
               <p>I was anxious, however, to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my doom; but, as the uſual forms were not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be diſpenſed with, I was for the preſent ordered to be carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the <hi>Maiſon de Force,</hi> that due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation might be had, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate my puniſhment to my offence.</p>
               <p>At a day appointed, I was preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſolemn tribunal, as a culprit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict, to be made acquainted with the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment due to my demerits. With great humanity, I was informed, that, previous to the pronouncing of the ſentence, I was at liberty to ſay any thing which I ſuppoſed might tend to extenuate my guilt.</p>
               <p>Imagining that a real ſtatement of facts might probably anſwer my purpoſe, better than a ſtring of improbabilities which I could eaſily have invented, I related to my judges, "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," ſaid I, "I paid my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to an amiable young lady, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered myſelf with the appearance of encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement, ſo far only as reſpected herſelf; but upon application to the lady's father, and anſwering a few interrogatories con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my circumſtances, I received a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive diſcharge from his premiſes; accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:035084_0136_1000095E2D582780"/>
with a threat of a degrading puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if ever I ſhould again preſume to mention the ſubject of love in the preſence of his daughter. Finding it impoſſible to obtain this accompliſhed female, till I had proved myſelf her equivalent in point of fortune, and the old gentleman expected guinea for guinea, I reſolved to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to my pen, as the moſt rapid means of acquiring riches.</p>
               <p>"I knew a gentleman who wrote himſelf into an annuity of three hundred pounds, by a little well timed abuſe, in a letter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to a certain great man. A ſecond epiſtle, addreſſed to the ſame illuſtrious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, was threatened in a few days. Some truths or falſehoods were alledged in the firſt which were not reliſhed by the man in power. The ſpecimen he had given was indeed ſo highly diſapproved, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was ſought after, found, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the manner which I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>"It was a kind of negative reward for the ſervices he had rendered, by withholding his ſatirical laſh. He was not expected, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the annual emolument he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to be daily varniſhing the character of his benefactor, according to the uſual practice; it was his ſilence only that had
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035084_0137_100009652AF3DD68"/>
been purchaſed, his ſilence only was requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>"Recollecting the particulars of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and with what eaſe a comfortable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence might be acquired, I commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcribbler, and produced the pamphlet which, from what at preſent appears, will turn out much leſs advantageous to me than I expected.</p>
               <p>"Believe me, gentlemen, this is the real fact: I had no malice againſt any of the perſons whom I have vilified. I meant no injury to them: I wiſhed only to benefit myſelf, and to become an adequate ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the lady whoſe hand I had ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."</p>
               <p>I concluded by obſerving, that, if I was not thought entitled to a reward, like the fortunate friend I had mentioned, I hoped the court would not think me deſerving of further puniſhment, having been already under lock and key for upwards of ſeven weeks.</p>
               <p>Having, as I ſuppoſed, ſpoken much to the purpoſe, and excited the compaſſion of my judges, I expected a ſentence of the moſt lenient kind. One month's impriſonment, and a fine of thirteen ſhillings and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, was the utmoſt that I dreaded; but I found myſelf exceedingly miſtaken:—The compoſition by which I thought to have
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:035084_0138_0FFFB554436366B0"/>
raiſed an independance, if not affluence, procured me the following ſentence. To be two years impriſoned, to ſtand twice on the pillory, to pay a fine of ſix ſhillings and eightpence, and to find ſureties for my good behavior for ſeven years.</p>
               <p>I was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, at the apparent ſeverity of this judgment; but I was compelled to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and to repair immediately to the miſerable manſion deſtined to receive me.</p>
               <p>The loſs of liberty I could have ſubmitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to with ſome degree of compoſure; but the idea of exhibiting my face to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, through an ignominious wooden frame, was inſupportable. Is this my reward, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed I, for turning politician? For my attempts to regulate mankind, and point out their duty and defects, I am to have the elevated ſtation of ſurveyor of the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments!</p>
               <p>After innumerable applications to my friends and relatives, ſome of whom move in a ſphere truly reſpectable, I obtained a remiſſion of the ignominious part of my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; the pillory was therefore removed from my affrighted imagination.</p>
               <p>By affected ſorrow and contrition, and repeated proteſtations that I would never more appear in the character of a politician, further indulgences were extended to me:
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:035084_0139_100009680A387868"/>
After the expiration of one year, inſtead of two, I was ſet at liberty; and even without entering into a recognizance, with ſurities for my future good "abearing."</p>
               <p>Finding myſelf in the wide world much ſooner than I had expected, I had not planned a mode of life which would enable me to procure ſubſiſtence: My mind had been ſo humbled by my ſufferings, that I had no ambition beyond that of being ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to get my bread. The flame of paſſion, which beauty had raiſed within my boſom, had become perfectly extinguiſhed. My ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, like myſelf, had loſt much of its bloom, and I knew the world too well to expect civility and attention in a threadbare coat. Beſides, the reſidence which I had quitted, did not reflect any conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of honor upon its tenants; I could not therefore build any pretentions to commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration on that account.</p>
               <p>I directed my ſteps from priſon, to the houſe of my ſiſter; a worthy creature, and a perſon for whom I had much affection and eſteem: Our tenderneſs for each other was indeed reciprocal; for, though ſhe knew me to be eccentric, ſhe knew alſo that I was rather an oddity than an infamous abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed calumniator.</p>
               <p>So rejoiced was ſhe at my liberation, that, as ſoon as ſhe beheld me, ſhe threw
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:035084_0140_1000096C26284B98"/>
herſelf into my arms, and felicitated me heartily on my acceſſion to liberty, regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of my diſguſting appearance. A ſuit of cloaths of her procuring, clean linen, and every comfortable appendage, enabled me to caſt off my wretched covering, in which poverty and filth were too conſpicuouſly portrayed. With my ragged and dirty hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliments. I alſo ſhook off a train of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, which never fail to be in the ſuite of wretchedneſs and miſery.</p>
               <p>But though I was received with affection and regard by my beloved ſiſter, and might have quartered myſelf upon her for a long time, before ſhe would even have hinted any diſapprobation of my conduct in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; I had too much ſpirit to live upon alms, and reſolved ſpeedily to engage in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life.</p>
               <p>To my clerical profeſſion it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to return: My crime and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and more particularly my ſentence, had ſtamped my character with indelia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble infamy, and rendered me unworthy of appearing in an eccleſiaſtical habit. Could I have had the audacity to reaſſume the ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red robe, the ordinary would doubtleſs have ſtripped me of it with indignity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>While I was ruminating on theſe, and other diſagreeable circumſtances, an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:035084_0141_0FFFB55B6D5FF780"/>
in one of the public prints particularly arreſted my attention: An itinerant compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of comedians, at no great diſtance from the metropolis, wanted a <hi>gentleman</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in their little troupe, a vacancy having been occaſioned by the deſertion of one of their principal members. Nothing was ſaid about terms; but it was requeſted that no perſon would apply who had not a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge of theatrical concerns, and was able to give ſatisfaction, both in tragedy and comedy, to a genteel and brilliant au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>Having always delighted in dramatic po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, and perfectly remembering the moſt ſtriking ſcenes in Shakeſpear, O<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>way. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve, Sheridan, and other celebrated writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I thought I ſhould ſoon be capable of appearing in ſome of the moſt ſtriking characters; eſpecially as I fortunately poſſeſſed a quick as well a retentive mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory.</p>
               <p>I repaired to Hendon, whither the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement directed me, and was ceremoniouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly introduced to the two managers. After ſome converſation on this important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a rehearſal of ſome paſſages was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, by way of ſpecimen of my theatric taſte and talents. Luckily my endeavo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> were approved; terms were propoſed, and I acceded to them. In conſideration of my
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:035084_0142_1000096ED7327230"/>
great merit, (as theſe dramatic ſovereigns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed themſelves) I was to receive ſeven ſhillings a week, and to have a <hi>clear benefit,</hi> at every town or village in which they thought proper to perform.</p>
               <p>That no miſunderſtanding might happen between me and my auguſt maſters, I was informed, it was expected that I ſhould find my own clean linen and ſtockings; but with regard to every thing elſe, I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a proper ſupply from their exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wardrobe.</p>
               <p>Preliminaries being thus adjuſted, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon my new duty, and, as I thought, performed wonders. I ſhone forth in the characters of Lear, Richard the Third, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Macbeth. Kitely, Abel Drugger and Marplot. To the audience I gave uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſatisfaction, and commanded from them burſts of applauſe, whenever I mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted a nice diſcrimination of character, and gave evident proofs that I entered into the ſpirit and meaning of the author.</p>
               <p>Thinking I had now got a permanent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, though not a very lucrative one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I found myſelf ſomewhat happier than I was in Newgate; but, ſo uncertain are all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man affairs, my merit, in my new profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was my deſtruction. The managers, notwithſtanding the theatre was crammed every evening on my account, began
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:035084_0143_100009756CA5A060"/>
to look on me with a jealous eye. Their nightly receipts doubly exceeded the ſums which they had ever taken, but that was not thought a ſufficient recompence for the loſs of fame and conſequence: They had been accuſtomed to ſhare the plaudits, as well as the profits of the houſe; but now their fineſt acting was diſregarded, and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed the whole of the applauſe.</p>
               <p>I now perceived that I was in danger of expulſion from our ſociety. I was ſo crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ically ſituated, that I knew not what ſteps to purſue. My offence was of ſo ſingular a kind, that I could not correct it, without reducing the income of my maſters, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing myſelf to ridicule and contempt.</p>
               <p>I daily expected a diſcharge, but my gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernors were ſo far actuated by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of honor and conſcience, that I was firſt permitted to have a benefit; and that benefit was much more productive than I expected. Believe me, Madam, I received the neat ſum of ſeven pounds, nineteen ſhillings, and ſixpence. So prodigious an accumulation of caſh, in one evening, is not extant in the annals of our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning, my two govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors diſpatched a meſſenger to my apartment, to inform me that my attendance on them was expected at a certain hour, which they
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:035084_0144_1000097713CC6BA0"/>
had appointed. I obeyed the mandate, and was received rather ceremoniouſly than cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially. Appearing in a ſubaltern character, I requeſted to be favored with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>The ſenior of theſe two kings of Brent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, after having thrice ſtroked his chin, deigned to addreſs me thus, "Far be it from us, Mr. Proteus, to complain of the manner of your conducting buſineſs; your abilities, as a comedian, are great, very great; they are of the firſt magnitude. We cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think of retaining a gentleman of ſuch diſtinguiſhed talents, in our vagrant troupe. Your efforts cannot fail of placing you at the head of one of the London theatres; and we ſhould act a villainous part to rob you of your deſerved emoluments, or to deprive perſons of diſtinction of that ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which your performances cannot fail to give. Permit me to add, Mr. Proteus, that human nature, is human nature; we have all a ſpice of vanity in our compoſition, and a man does not like to be totally eclipſed, after having been allowed to ſhine with ſome degree of luſtre for many years. To be plain with you, Sir, your talents are too ſplendid for our plain company.—While you continue with us, the audience come only to ſee and hear you: When you are gone they will, as before, be ſatisfied
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035084_0145_1000097D16215438"/>
with our poor exertions, and ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to favor us with their plaudits. I believe, Mr. Proteus, I need not explain my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any farther; your penetration can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover my meaning. In ſhort, Sir, it will be for our mutual benefit and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſeparate as ſoon as poſſible."</p>
               <p>The other manager bowed aſſent; and I did not oppoſe my diſcharge, it was convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me in ſuch flattering terms. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of my maſters reminded me of that of the late Britiſh Roſcius, who, thinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother player ſuperior to him in a few cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, engaged that player at a <hi>large</hi> ſalary, to lay him on the <hi>ſhelf,</hi> as it is termed. By this ſtep he prevented a formidable oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the other houſe; and he completely prevented it on his own boards, becauſe he was limited to an inferior caſt of charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>My vanity feaſted not a little, on the idea of being diſcarded for having too much merit; and I was the better reconciled to my deſtiny, as my benefit had lodged a few ſhiners in my pocket.</p>
               <p>After thanking my governors for their civility, and receiving a balance due to me of a few ſhillings, I took my leave of them, and bade adieu to the wooden theatre of Hendon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="unknown:035084_0146_1000097E9BCC8FD8"/>No expenſe attended my removal; my goods and chattles were all perſonal, my whole wardrobe being upon my back.</p>
               <p>Not thinking ſo highly of myſelf, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the flattering circumſtances which I have mentioned) as to ſuppoſe I was qualified to make my appearance at either of the royal theatres, I took the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect road to Bath. I thought myſelf, at leaſt, capable of being tranſplanted into that flouriſhing theatrical garden.</p>
               <p>I remain at preſent in that city, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect daily to be incorporated and inrolled with the perſons of the drama, who perform alternately there, and at Briſtol, another city at the diſtance of about twelve miles.</p>
               <p>Soon after my arrival here, madam, chance threw your advertiſement before my eyes. I reſolved immediately to become your correſpondent, called for pen, ink and paper, and wrote this long epiſtle, perhaps too ſevere a trial for your patience.</p>
               <p>Though I am a whimſical kind of being madam, I would ſcorn to impoſe on any woman. I have given an honeſt, candid, and ingenuous account of myſelf; and if, after due conſideration, you think I have any claim to your attention, you will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably favor me with a line. If, on the other hand, you ſhould deem me an impertinent puppy, you are at liberty to burn this letter,

which coſt me upwards of two hours labor, and with it all remembrance of your itiner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant correſpondent.</p>
               <p>You, Madam, are now in full poſſeſſion of my genuine hiſtory. I have not attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to gloſs or miſrepreſent a ſingle circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. It will, however, convince you, Madam, that if misfortunes arrive, I have always my ſhifts and reſources at hand. Should I be ever ſo much laden with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, I ſhall never ſink under my burden; being always ſure of finding out ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to keep me above want. With your ready caſh, and my knowledge of the world, we might become an enviable and a happy pair.

               <p>Had I continued in the humble ſphere of a curate, I ſhould not have had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to addreſs a lady of your fortune; eſpecially with ſuch accompliſhments as you ſeem to poſſeſs, if any judgment is to be formed by your elegant little billet in the newſpaper.</p>
               <p>Beſides the living which I poſſeſs, I have the proſpect of another advancement in the church; an advancement equally honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:035084_0149_10000987615B4E80"/>
and lucrative: It is no leſs than a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend, to the amount of four pounds nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſhillings per annum. With my own income, and the intereſt of your money, we can afford to make a very reſpectable figure in this country. Very few could equal us in ſplendor and magnificence, and hardly any would be able to excel us.</p>
               <p>I am a widower almoſt without incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, being left with only two boys and the ſame number of girls: So ſmall a fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily will not, I hope, be conſidered as any obſtacle to our nuptials.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould have any objection to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Wales, I am not ſo particularly attached to my native air and ſoil, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe my aſſent to any place of reſidence you may think proper to approve, having it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in my power, for a ſmall annual ſum, to procure a curate to perform duty on my living.</p>
               <p>As there is a poſſibility of our not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the buſineſs, on which we are now treating, I think it fair and equitable for each party to pay half the poſtage of this letter; I have therefore paid my moiety, and cauſed the words <hi>half poſt paid</hi> to be written on the outſide, not doubting but you will advance an equal ſum. Should this affair terminate agreeably to my wiſhes,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:035084_0150_10014B1DD7F88150"/>
we ſhall find no difficulty in adjuſting the expences of this correſpondence.</p>
               <p>If you meet with a more advantageous propoſal, than what I now offer, you will doubtleſs cloſe immediately with that, and reject mine.

               <p>I have no great quantity of cows or ſheep, but my premiſes are completely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with animals of inferior magnitude; all of which are my own property, when I can catch them. Thouſands and tens of thouſands compoſe but a very inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of the number of my live ſtock.</p>
               <p>To come to the point at once. Madam, I farm an exetenſive rabbit warren, and ſhould think myſelf very happy if you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to be miſtreſs of it. I find it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently lucrative to enable me to live de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and comfortably; but, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of your money, I could alſo take a conſiderable farm, and we might then fare ſumptuouſly.</p>
               <p>My houſe is delightfully ſituated on a pleaſant ſpot, remarkable for the ſalubrity of the air. If I could entice you, by any means, into theſe regions, it ſhould be my ſtudy to make you happy; if I cannot, I ſhall not condemn myſelf for the attempt, eſpecially if you ſhould be ſo obliging as to favor me with any kind of anſwer.

                     <p>I HAVE twice ventured within the pale of matrimony; and am now, for the ſecond time a widower. The connubial ſtate is a happy one: Of this I am ſo much convinced, that, even at my advanced peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of life, I cannot endure the thought of remaining ſingle.</p>
                     <p>You will be ſurpriſed, Madam, at having a man of ninety, among your train of admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. To that age I am now arrived; and if you are a ſteady, prudent lady, you will not object to that age. I have got rid of thoſe hoity toity boyiſh actions which render young men ridiculous; and I have clipped the wings of my extravagance, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly conducted me into every ſpecies of riot and diſſipation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="156" facs="unknown:035084_0155_10014ACC92C9C0E0"/>There is another conſideration, Madam, worth attending to, and which will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have its due weight with you, as a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of diſcretion. There is not ſo much danger of having a large family of children, as there might have been, ſuppoſing I was ſixty or ſeventy years younger. A dozen or two of children are not to be ſupported with a trifle, at the rate proviſions now are, and therefore they would be an incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to us.</p>
                     <p>Some inconſiderate women would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps object to my age, but what's ninety years! I am but a boy among ſome of my acquaintance! a mere chicken! If the lady I am thus addreſſing, has any knowledge of the world, (and I am convinced ſhe has by the terms in which her advertiſement is couched) ſhe will take an early opportunity of ſending a line to her moſt humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</p>

               <p>Such, my Louiſa, are the epiſtles which I have lately received, but they are not the whole: They are a few ſelected from ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral large budgets or packets; the cream, the quinteſcence of the whole. Imagine then, my dear girl, what traſh the others muſt have contained!</p>
               <p>If the peruſal of the tranſcripts of letters which I have now ſent you, ſhould afford

you any diverſion or amuſement, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is anſwered; I had no other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for undertaking the taſk of copying them.</p>
               <p>I have the ſatisfaction of acquainting my Louiſa, that the tender negociation between Mr. Proby and myſelf, ſeems to advance rapidly, without obſtacle or interruption. You and I, my dear friend, are ſteering for the ſame haven. May no adverſe and tempeſtuous winds drive us again into the ocean of uncertainty, and daſh us againſt the rocks of diſappointment.</p>
               <p>I ſhall impatiently expect an anſwer to this letter; and ſurely I have an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate claim to one epiſtle, now you are too long ones in arrear. Let me entreat you to give a circumſtantial diary of every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of importance in your part of the world, ſince the date of your laſt. When I ſay, "every tranſaction of importance" I mean every tranſaction of what kind ſoev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for every thing muſt be of importance to me, which in the leaſt concerns my Louiſa.</p>
               <p>Among the billets, which this poſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys to you that from Peter Protius is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the foremoſt in point of literary mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it. Whether in jeſt or earneſt, there is ſomething pleaſingly whimſical in the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter he has given of himſelf; and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly acknowledges, without a bluſh, that
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:035084_0157_10014AD58DE576F0"/>
he is an arrant coward. He has ventured, however, to give me a challenge; but were I to accept it, perhaps he would flinch as he did when his military antagoniſt dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the field: In love, as well as war, there are many who paſs for daring or bluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering heroes, who ſhew ſtrong ſymptoms of timidity, when honor calls them upon actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al duty.</p>
               <p>My lover of ninety might perhaps ſtand a chance, if he was the only man exiſting upon earth. His argument on the method of avoiding incumbrances, will not be much attended to. You will think I have no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on you, if I do not inſtantly reſign my pen. It will have performed its taſk for the preſent, when it has again aſſured you that I am</p>

               <p>MY beſt thanks are due to you, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda, for your very obliging letters; but how am I to make an adequate return! If you expect ſheet for ſheet, or line for line as you ſtrongly intimate, to whom can I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for materials? In a remote part of the country, a dearth of incidents is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and I hope my Belinda would not wiſh me to invent tales, or even to adopt exaggeration upon facts, purely to ſwell out an epiſtle.</p>
               <p>I have regularly communicated to you our progreſs in the road to happineſs. I can have nothing freſh to impart to you on that buſineſs (highly important buſineſs to me!) till it is concluded, confirmed, and ratified. That day of accompliſhment is not far diſtant—"Fly ſwiftly, ye minutes!"</p>
               <p>As you have frequently expreſſed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know the method of killing time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the woods and groves, I think I can convey an idea of it, by relating to you the
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:035084_0159_10014AD8956E8AB0"/>
particulars of a ſplendid entertainment, to which I was invited as a gueſt.</p>
               <p>Sir Thomas Dighton, juſt come of age, acquired his father's dignity about three years ago, but could not fully poſſeſs his large eſtate till he attained the age of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyone years. On Wedneſday laſt he arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the period which legally pronounced him Man; and the happy day was uſhered in with the ringing of bells, dancing round the maypole, and every ruſtic method of expreſſing the moſt lively demonſtrations of joy. Sir Thomas's generoſity on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was unbounded. Particular invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were given to all the genteel families in the environs of his ſeat, and a general proclamation was circulated, that all his tenants, ſervants and neighbors, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to repair to Dighton Hall, to partake of the feſtivity of the day: So extenſive was his idea of beſtowing plenty and good cheer, that peaſants and paupers were not exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!</p>
               <p>Auxiliary cooks from the metropolis were engaged upon this joyful occaſion; and, that the ears of the company might be feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extatic ſounds, the beſt vocal and inſtrumental performers were procured from the ſame great capital.</p>
               <p>Every luxury of the table was abundantly ſupplied. Wines of the moſt expenſive
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:035084_0160_10014ADD131B4410"/>
kind, were as liberally beſtowed as if they were eſtimated but as water. This was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly the caſe among the firſt claſs of the viſitors, who attended. Thoſe who were deemed the ſecond in rank, were entertained in an apartment leſs magnificent, but their fare was hardly inferior to that which was provided for thoſe who moved in a more elevated ſphere of life.</p>
               <p>A third claſs was entertained with almoſt equal pageantry and profuſion; and the laſt diviſion, far exceeding all the others in point of number, were abundantly ſupplied with good Old Engliſh provender, and fine ſparking ale; ſome of the latter was as aged as the young baronet, whoſe majority they were celebrating.</p>
               <p>The park and gardens received the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of the manſion: Many hundreds of the delighted neighbors regaled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>el freſco,</hi> under the ſhade of trees and ſhrubberies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſoliage of which became tremulous by the gentle breeze fanning and refreſhing the company in the performance of their taſk; that of quaffing frequent li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations to the proſperity of their generous and indulgent hoſt.</p>
               <p>Cheerfulneſs, with her endearing ſmiles, ſat enthroned on every countenance. All was joy, harmony, pleaſantry, jocularity and glee. The adjacent country ſeemed to
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:035084_0161_10014ADFE4409808"/>
partake of the general ſatisfaction; the woods, the copices, the gardens, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amelled fields, as if clad in their holiday habiliments, appeared to have been arrayed for the feſtive purpoſe, and to have poured forth all their perfume, with their ſplendid trappings.</p>
               <p>The birds, as if intuitively become ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the cauſe of the grand aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blage, joined in the general harmony, and from every tree and bough iſſued the vocal warblings of feathered choiriſts. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the ſcene, the weather kindly contrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted; an unclouded ſky, a ſerene temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature of air. refreſhed by ſoft breathing ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyrs, perfected the elyſium of Dighton Hall.</p>
               <p>This is the general account of occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on that auſpicious day. I will now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to be circumſtantial. I had the honor to be claſſed among the firſt rank of viſitors, and partook of a moſt elegant and excellent repaſt. On this occaſion the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and ladies aſſociated; but, ſhortly after dinner, etiquette ſeemed to point out that it was expedient for the latter to retire, a proper apartment having been reſerved for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The propriety of this ſtep was tacitly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged, hardly a ſyllable being mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by any of the gentlemen preſent, which
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:035084_0162_10014AE167015618"/>
could be conſtrued to oppoſe our departure. A ceremonious ſeparation took place, and we repaired to the ſcene which had been provided for us. Our ſelect ſiſterhood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of about thirty members, and for our accommodation and entertainment, a ſmall band of muſic attended. Madam Mara was the only vocal mercenary; her profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional talents were rewarded with that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality which they juſtly merited. Many volunteers, however, inliſted in our vocal corps.</p>
               <p>A beautiful young lady, of the name of Harcourt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſung moſt divinely. Nothing could be more enchanting than her voice, except the irreſiſtible graces which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied it, and the angelic figure which ſo perfectly accorded with her celeſtial harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. All was ſupernatural and adorable! ſhe ſeemed in every reſpect, ſuperior to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings merely terreſtial: Were ſhe a man, ſhe ſhould be the god of my idolatry!</p>
               <p>After Miſs Harcourt had enraptured ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery auditor and beholder, I was ſolicited to contribute my vocal mite; I pleaded hard to be excuſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, perceiving that rudeneſs only could exculpate me, I reluctantly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the unanimous wiſhes of our fair ſociety. But oh! what a falling off! I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted my own weak endeavors to pleaſe, and condemned my effrontery in preſuming
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:035084_0163_10014AE3FA0608D0"/>
to enter the liſts with a perſon ſo infinitely my ſuperior. I lamented that I did not ſubmit to any cenſures, rather than contraſt the croaking of the raven, with the ſilver ſweetneſs of the nightingale.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, my Belinda, you may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at theſe obſervations, knowing that I have hitherto entertained no contemptible opinion of my muſical accompliſhments, and thinking, as you have flatteringly aſſured me, that my exertions in that line have been more than tolerable. But I now hang down my head abaſhed. Miſs Harcourt is "the faireſt among the fair."—She is "angelic among angels!"—Mediocrity is the utmoſt excellence that I can ever hope to arrive at.</p>
               <p>Madam Mara, as uſual<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gave perfect ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction. Miſs Dighton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſiſter to Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, without much voice, diſplayed great muſical taſte, and afforded entertainment. Several other ladies were entitled to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for their aſſiſtance in our little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, and the moments glided away with great rapidity. At length a promenade was propoſed, and agreed to: We repaired to the ſhrubbery; and, ſhortly after our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival there. Sir Thomas Dighton, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained leave of abſence from the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, haſtened to pay his reſpects to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="unknown:035084_0164_10014AE792E41328"/>With unaffected politeneſs and affability, he ſeverally addreſſed our little coterie, and thanked us for the honor we had conferred on him by our viſit. Some general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation enſued; after which I was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the groupe by Sir Thomas, and conducted to a remote corner of the planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Without much preamble, Sir Thomas made poſitive profeſſions of attachment to me; ſaid he had long been a ſilent admirer of my perſon and perfections; and had now come to a reſolution to ſolicit my hand in form. Whatever might be the amount of my fortune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he aſſured me that he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly indifferent on that ſcore, having more than an ample independance of his own; but if I would condeſcend to be the miſtreſs of Dighton Hall, as I was already the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign poſſeſſor of his heart, he ſhould think himſelf the happieſt of mankind; if, on the contrary his ſuit ſhould be rejected, he ſhould be one of the moſt miſerable of the human race. He concluded with an earneſt wiſh, that, if I did not wholly diſapprove of his addreſſes, I would give out a ray of hope that there might be a poſſibility of his ſucceeding, after the uſual aſſiduities eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in ſo tender a negociation.</p>
               <p>I thanked Sir Thomas for his flattering partiality in my favor, and earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:035084_0165_10014AEB4F0E1C58"/>
him to ſeek for a perſon who had a better claim to the title of Lady Dighton; one whoſe birth and fortune placed her on a footing with himſelf. I expatiated on the impropriety of the alliance he propoſed, and begged for his own perſonal honor and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olument, that he would not urge the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal which he had ſo inconſiderately made.</p>
               <p>He proteſted that nothing ſhould divert him from his purpoſe, if I would vouchſafe to hearken to his petition; but, as I was ſo injenious in framing objections for him, he feared I was averſe to the overtures he had made.</p>
               <p>I repeated my obſervations with addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional energy; but he ſtill perſiſted in his reſolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he could be favored with the moſt diſtant proſpect of being attended to. After many proteſtations of inviolate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I would condeſcend to h<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>arken ſeriouſly to the dictates of his paſſion. I told him ingenuouſly that I was incapable of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to his tale; that I had not a heart at my diſpoſal; that ſolemn engagements had been reciprocally made, between me and one whom I preferred to all the world; and that nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on my part, ſhould cancel thoſe engagements; that I was ſenſible of the honor which he intended to confer on me; but though he was truly
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:035084_0166_10014AECD196BF20"/>
amiable and reſpectable, and infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what my moſt aſpiring notions had ever aimed at, yet I was indiſpenſibly oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcourage addreſſes which could only feed my vanity, without a poſſibility of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering a tittle of my ſacred vow; or to have the leaſt bias on my affections.</p>
               <p>He heard me with aſtoniſhment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. He was ſo greatly agitated, that he frequently attempted to interrupt me; but finding, at length, that I was peremptory in my reſolves, and that it would be equally ungenerous and ungenteel to attempt to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue me into a breach of articles, he barely expreſſed his ſorrow at the intelligence he received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, with a ſigh of reſiganation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned all proſpect of ſucceſs; declaring that the barriers between him and happineſs were inſurmountable.</p>
               <p>This unexpected overture from a man of rank and fortune, could not but awaken my vanity, and atone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſome degree, for the mortification I had received in ſubmitting to be a foil to Miſs Harcourt. I began to entertain a more exalted opinion of myſelf than I had hitherto done; and gave myſelf credit for attractions of the ſuperior kind, without conſidering that men are as fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently governed by caprice, as by the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of beauty and accompliſhments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="unknown:035084_0167_10014AEE55709A08"/>I muſt admit, however, that, though I enjoyed the triumph over Sir Thomas, I felt a pang for the diſappointment he had ſuſtained. Though I exulted on my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of inflicting wounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I had not a wiſh that the ſufferings and ſmarts which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſhould be too ſevere. Had I not been engaged, irrevocably engaged, to a man whom I had every reaſon to adore, Sir Thomas Dighton's bait would perhaps have been too alluring for me to reject. Let me tell you, my Belinda, a young man juſt twentyone years of age, with an agreeable perſon, an immenſe fortune, and a title, are no deſpicable ingredients in the matrimonial <hi>ragout.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This flattering preference in the opinion of Sir Thomas, in the preſence of many beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and accompliſhed females, made my little heart palpitate with joy. It furniſhed me too with an opportunity of convincing Mr. Graham that I was not merely induced by proſpects of advantage to accede to his propoſals of matrimony. I ſhall now take the earlieſt opportunity of informing him, that I have refuſed the addreſſes of Sir Thomas Dighton, infinitely his ſuperior in point of fortune.</p>
               <p>Little did the young baronet expect that he ſhould meet with a repulſe from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſmall fortune, and perhaps ſmaller
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035084_0168_10014AF4C86CD858"/>
perfections. As ſoon as he had received the final ſentence from my lips, he ſtarted an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſubject of converſation; we intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the throng, and no particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, during the remainder of the day, was beſtowed by Sir Thomas on your Louiſa.</p>
               <p>A ball concluded the feſtivity of the day; and it was not till after the arrival of the ſucceeding morning, that the well pleaſed gueſts could prevail upon themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from the hoſpitable manſion.</p>
               <p>The length of this letter will ſufficiently apologize for my concluding it, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting all my ſtore of materials, which may be required in my next epiſtle.</p>
               <p>Though I have refuſed the honor intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is with pleaſure I inform you that <hi>I might have been</hi> Lady <hi>Dighton</hi>; and that <hi>I am,</hi> and <hi>ever ſhall be,</hi>

               <head>LETTER XXXV. <hi>BELINDA BLACKET,</hi> to <hi>LOUISA LENOX.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN a former letter, my Louiſa, I gave you a long account of my reverend ſwain, and the methods I intended to purſue to procure a living; but you have been ſo much engaged on your own affairs, that our little inſignificant advances ſeem hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to your attention.</p>
               <p>I hope Sir Thomas Dighton's civilities will neither prevent nor retard the propoſed union between Mr. Graham and my Louiſa. A little vanity may be permitted to reſide in a female breaſt, and that little muſt have been highly gratified by the young baronets ingenuous declaration; but I hope you will remain firm to your firſt engagement. To prevent even a poſſibility of wavering, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch tempting circumſtances, let me earneſtly recommend to you an immediate compliance with Mr. Graham's requeſt; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him inſtantly to the altar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="unknown:035084_0170_10014AF8C67820C0"/>Pardon me. Louiſa, for ſuppoſing you capable of infidelity, or breach of vow. I only hint at poſſibilities, not probabilities. There are perſons who, ſituated as you are, would cancel the moſt ſolemn aſſeverations, and plead the cauſe as an ample juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch conduct. But I will venture to pronounce that you are not one of thoſe perſons, and that, attached as you are by pure affection to Mr. Graham, no allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or advantages can warp your inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind.</p>
               <p>Your narrative of the proceedings on Sir Thomas's attaining his majority, entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me much: Your kindneſs in giving it ſo circumſtantially was very flattering to me, as it convinced me that you did not grudge the time devoted to my gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I hope the enamored baronet will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new his attack.

               <head>LETTER XXXVI. <hi>LOUISA LENOX,</hi> to <hi>BELINDA BLACKET.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>YOU did me injuſtice, Belinda, to ſuppoſe me capable of encouraging the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of any man, after the ſolemn contract between me and Mr. Graham. Believe me, my dear friend, to be ſeated on a throne I would not deviate in the leaſt from my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements with that amiable youth.</p>
               <p>Your tender concern on ſuppoſing me expoſed to the moſt trying temptations, is an additional proof of your eſteem for me. I am not therefore diſpleaſed at your inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of fear and apprehenſion, that I ſhould be unequal to the taſk which had been impoſed upon me.</p>
               <p>I ſhall dwell no longer on this ſubject, having matters of more importance to relate to you. I am obliged to Sir Thomas Digh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton for the honor he intended me; but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to your advice. I have put it out of my power to become Lady Dighton.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="unknown:035084_0172_10014AFBCE089720"/>I was entertained, Belinda, with a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait you ſent me of your clerical ſwain, in a former letter, before you favored me with your freſh packet, and I admire your great prudence and generoſity, in procuring a living for him. He ought to think himſelf a very happy fellow, to find a patron in a lover. I mean not to inſinuate that he is a a mere mercenary lover, but certainly a good living is a very deſirable acquiſition. Who would not reſign a fellowſhip, for a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful young lady, and a fat benefice?</p>
               <p>I admire the generoſity, or rather the gratitude, of your "deſerving man." as you emphatically call him, when he makes a voluntary offer of ſettling your whole for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune upon yourſelf; and your noble and ſpirited refuſal to accept of ſuch conditions, reflects equal honor on yourſelf.</p>
               <p>Your reſolution of deſtroying the letters, which you may happen to receive from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture correſpondents, I greatly approve.</p>
               <p>And now, my Belinda, permit me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that I have exchanged the name of Lenox for that of Graham. Yeſterday's ſun ſaw me, with ſacred ſolemnity, initiated into the myſteries of matrimony. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emony was attended by the moſt reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nobility and gentry in the neighborhood, and a ſmile of ſatisfaction appeared on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry face.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="unknown:035084_0173_10014B04D80D8820"/>The huſbandman forſook his field, and the ſhepherd his flock, to join in the feſtivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the day, and mix in the proceſſion.— Mr. Graham is the idol of all who know him, from the nobleman to the humble cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager: undiſſembled joy was therefore teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by every means that could be contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on that auſpicious day, which united me to the beſt of men.</p>
               <p>On our return from the altar, we partook of ſome refreſhment at Mr. Graham's houſe; and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after taking and airing, came back to a ſumptuous dinner, provided, upon the occaſion, for the moſt reſpectable of our friends. Another extenſive table was ſpread in the great hall, for thoſe of leſs opulence, and who moved in an humbler ſphere; and a third for the peaſantry, and others. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of beer, and plenty of all kinds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, were alſo diſtributed to the populace without doors.</p>
               <p>In the evening we had a ball, which was compoſed of the firſt characters in this part of the kingdom, and was remarkably ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did.</p>
               <p>Congratulate me, my dear Belinda, on this tranſcendantly joyful occaſion; for, believe me, I am the happieſt of my ſex!</p>
               <p>My ſituation, in all reſpects, is realy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viable; the houſe or which I am now legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtituted the miſtreſs, is an antique but
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:035084_0174_10014B065A15CBA0"/>
elegant building, and is ſituated in a pad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, at a proper diſtance from the road.— Many of the rooms are ſpacious, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the modern taſte; the others are neat, ſimple and convenient; the decora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions leſs ſplendid, though equally pleaſing. A pleaſure garden of about three acres lies behind the manſion, and is laid out with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite elegance and judgment. It abounds with variety of the choiceſt ſhrubs, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees and flowers, among which are many curious exotics.</p>
               <p>Here, in the ſweet ſociety of my dear and amiable companion, the hours glide happily away. Like another Eden, our garden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a paradiſe to us, whence there is no danger of being driven, as we touch not the forbidden fruit.</p>
               <p>A Summerhouſe, beautifully conſtructed, embelliſhes one corner of the garden; whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we can repair when ſultry Phoebus is too powerful, or when a ſhower of rain renders ſuch retirement neceſſary. The murmuring of a little rivulet which meanders near this little ſtructure, has a pleaſing effect, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in hot weather.</p>
               <p>An orchard, now rich with autumnal fruit, joins to our pleaſure garden. It is pleaſing to the view, and promiſes to furniſh our table with a luxurious deſſert.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="unknown:035084_0175_10014B07DDC1C858"/>Sometimes, to vary the ſcene, I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany Mr. Graham in his phaeton (the only carriage he at preſent poſſeſſes) to take the air, and occaſionally to viſit ſome hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and friendly neighbor.</p>
               <p>Not above half a mile from our reſidence a tranſparent river runs through the verdant meadows. This ſtream is often viſited by the ladies and gentlemen in our vicinity, for the ſole purpoſe of angling.—I have been many times prevailed on to be one of the party upon theſe occaſions, but I cannot deem that a diverſion, which inflicts death or torture on any animal, however inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant it may appear to us of the human race.</p>
               <p>Whilſt more innocent amuſements are to be found, I ſhall not in future be eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to join fiſhing parties. But, as I would not affect to be over delicate, I ſhall decline ſuch engagements, by making any apology that may occur to me.</p>
               <p>Indeed, Belinda, home has ſo many charms for me, that I ſeldom am induced to quit it. If I have the company of my good man, I have not a wiſh beyond it; he is all the world to me!</p>
               <p>Mr. Graham's ſiſter, whoſe perfections I have already mentioned to you, ſhews ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery attention to me in her power; ſhe is ſo capital in the muſical line, that I have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:035084_0176_10014B0BF661C0C0"/>
her to become her pupil. She po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litely thanked me for the horor I propoſed to confer on her, and gladly took me under her tutorage. For the ſhort time that I have applied myſelf to the ſtudy of that pleaſing ſcience, ſhe flatters me with having made a conſiderable progreſs. I hope I ſhall in time, become a proficient, as I would joyfully embrace every opportunity of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering myſelf more worthy of Mr. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>
               <p>My muſical tutoreſs ſometimes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies her brother and myſelf in a rural <hi>promenade</hi> about the hamlet. In theſe lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ited excurſions we are ſaluted with the clumſy bows and courteſies of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who frequently receive ſmall bounties from us, in return for which we have their fervent prayers, articulated in homely but in heartfelt accents.</p>
               <p>Such an honeſt ſimplicity of manners prevails among our peaſantry, ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence appears in all their little pleaſures and purſuits, as to convey an idea of the harmleſs ſhepherds on the Arcadian plains, ſo much celebrated by our paſtoral po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.</p>
               <p>A theft or robbery is hardly ever heard of among us. Contented with the ſcanty but wholeſome food which their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry ſupplies, they never think of invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:035084_0177_10014B0EE4384720"/>
the property of others. We might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſleep in ſecurity with our doors wide open.</p>
               <p>How different is this, my Belinda, from the ſtate of rapine which reigns in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis! Where vice not only lurks in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure corners, but ſtalks forth in open day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and danger is to be apprehended in your public ſtreets, Even the utmoſt vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the police cannot protect you from the depredations of the robber and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſin.</p>
               <p>Suffer me to prevail on you to viſit theſe happy regions. You have my earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to make your abode here, as long as you may find it agreeable; and Mr. Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, on his part, will exert himſelf to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your departure.</p>
               <p>But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould you beſtow your hand upon Mr. Proby, which appears to me more than probable, I fear you will not be able to comply with my requeſt, as his reſidence will perhaps be required on the living, to which he is to be preſented. Of that you will inform me hereafter.</p>
               <p>You aſk my opinion on the propoſed match between you and the reverend youth whom you ſo much eſteem. My opinion will certainly be acceptable, becauſe it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds entirely with your own. Wed him without unneceſſary delay! If he is as
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:035084_0178_10014B106F383608"/>
worthy as you repreſent him (and I never had any reaſon to doubt of your veracity) be careful not to loſe him. He is a man worth any woman, and his equal may not eaſily be found.</p>
               <p>I wait impatiently for your letter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulation on my becoming a bride. I know you will rejoice at my happineſs; and, I aſſure you, if there is a poſſibility of rendering it more complete, the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tidings of your being happily united with the man you love, alone can do it.</p>
               <p>Permit me, my Belinda, to affirm, that you will ever have the ſecond place in my eſteem, which is all that can be reaſonably expected from</p>

               <p>I HEARTILY congratulate you, my Louiſa, on the celebration of your nuptials May your happineſs be proportioned to your deſerts! Celeſtial joys would then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wait you! You would be beyond the reach of thoſe ſorrows and diſappointments which uſually embitter the cup of life! ſerving as alloy to thoſe pleaſures which muſt not be permitted to exceed the terreſtrial ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard.</p>
               <p>Again muſt I entreat your pardon for ſuppoſing there was a poſſibility of your breaking your faith with Mr. Graham; but for thoſe we eſteem our fears are alarmed on the moſt inſignificant occurences; the moſt diſtant danger gives birth to anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and we cenſure the gentle breeze, leſt it ſhould inflict a cold on the object of our attention.</p>
               <p>Frequently, my Louiſa, have you enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to furniſh you with intelligence from
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:035084_0180_10014B17999560A0"/>
the metropolis, the ſource of adventure and intelligence; and I have always endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to oblige you, as far as the limits of a ſheet of paper would allow me. A myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affair has lately given riſe to much conjecture, and ſome altercation; but the myſtery begins to be unravelled, and the doubts ſeem to be ſuperſeded by ſtubborn facts.</p>
               <p>A young lady, beautiful, nobly allied, and only in her twentyſecond year, thought herſelf neglected by the youths of quality of the other ſex, and therefore, if ſhe could not have the ſatisfaction of procuring an actual wooer, ſhe was determined at leaſt to enjoy the reputation of being wooed: She therefore conjured up a man of quality, no leſs than the heir apparent of a puiſſant duke. To give the appearance of reality to the imaginary courtſhip, ſhe did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine herſelf to the bare method of commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icating the pleaſing tidings by the lips; ſhe produced letters, not only from the ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enamored ſwain, but even from the head of the moſt noble houſe. Corroborative e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles were alſo circulated in variety of forms and places; inſomuch that the tale was almoſt univerſally believed, and a ſpeedy union was expected to have taken place between the young nobleman, who was utterly a ſtranger to the affair, and the
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:035084_0181_10014B1AD1775810"/>
young lady who planned and projected the whole buſineſs, and wanted to paſs upon the world for a marchioneſs elect.</p>
               <p>Happy, no doubt, at being thought the enviable object of an amiable young noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's addreſſes, ſhe produced many docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to keep afloat the ſtory which ſhe had circulated; well knowing that as ſoon as the eclairciſſement took place her triumph would be at an end.</p>
               <p>At length, however, the narrative paſſed through ſo many channels of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it found its way to the ears of thoſe who were ſuppoſed to be the parties. Wholly unacquainted with every ſyllable that had been related to them, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginary riſe and progreſs of an hymeneal treaty, they naturally expreſſed their aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment at the ingenuity of the fabricator.</p>
               <p>A diſcovery was now made that all the reports, epiſtles, billets, &amp;c. had been fab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricated. The marriage articles which had been ſigned, the jewels, and the bridal hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliments, were found to have been only in the epiſtles circulated by the young lady; and all her ideal rank and conſequence van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed inſtantly into air.</p>
               <p>Though the fair adventureſs knew that it was impoſſible for her to eſcape detection in the end, ſhe flattered herſelf with being ſomewhat longer in poſſeſſion of this ideal
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:035084_0182_1001491ED63205A8"/>
happineſs and ſplendor; but, as a develope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was manifeſt, ſhe, with infinite addreſs, endeavored to make it appear that ſhe had been impoſed on as well as the noble lord; and for a time the public opinion was in equipoiſe whether ſhe was the impoſer, or the object of impoſition.</p>
               <p>The young lady had many advocates, who endeavored to affix the odium, due to the fabricator of the ſtory, on another quarter. But the charge of delinquency is now gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally directed to the heroine of the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and ſhe will find it no eaſy taſk to get acquitted of the offence for which ſhe is now arraigned before the public.</p>
               <p>I wiſh it may hereafter appear that ſhe is perfectly innocent; or, if not, that ſhe ſhould not incur the deteſtation of the world, for the exerciſes of a ſpecies of folly which could not be injurious to any one. A beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful young woman wiſhes to be noticed; ſhe thinks herſelf fully entitled to the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and almoſt to the adorations of young men; ſhe thinks ſhe has ſo good a claim to their aſſiduities, that if they neglect their duty, it is but doing juſtice to her charms to create ideal lovers; that ſhe may at leaſt appear to poſſeſs what ſhe has an indubitable claim to.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, my Louiſa, I may not be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly orthodox in the creed of love; but I hope
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:035084_0183_10014B1C5450BEA0"/>
you will admit there is no great impropriety in the argument I have ventured to advance in this buſineſs. It would afford me infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite pleaſure if the young nobleman, whom the lady thought proper to be in love with, and to make the affection reciprocal, would actually realize the tale, and readily conduct her to the altar. He muſt be convinced that ſhe has a regard for him, or ſhe would not have ſelected him for her hero.</p>
               <p>I have been thus particular in my little narrative, becauſe it is now the general topic of converſation among the great and little world in our extenſive capital.</p>
               <p>Though in a former letter I mention my reſolution of deſtroying any future billets that might be addreſſed to me, I have taken the liberty of reſerving a few of them, but they are not very remarkable for their bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy. The contents of ſome of them, however, may probably amuſe you. I have tranſcribed a few of the beſt of them, and hereby faithfully promiſe you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> never more to trouble you with the effuſions of any more of my newſpaper lovers; they are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally as follow.</p>

               <head>LETTER XXXVIII. <hi>HARRY HOUNSLOW,</hi> to <hi>BELINDA BLACKET.</hi>

                  <salute>MADAM,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I SAW your advertiſement in the World, but buſineſs of ſome importance put it out of my power to pay the attention to it that it merited. To tell you the real truth Madam, I was taken that very day into the hands of the officers of police. Some accuſations were made againſt me in Bow ſtreet; and though the charges were not fully ſubſtanciated, I was ordered into confinement.</p>
               <p>Priſoners of war are ſometimes ſuffered to be at large on their parol, but gentlemen of the road are not thought entitled to ſuch indulgences. I hope, Madam, you will think I have made a ſufficient apology for not ſooner endeavoring to find you out, and throwing myſelf at your feet.</p>
               <p>My buſineſs, Madam, is honorable, but angerous; the late extravagant improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:035084_0185_10014B23655DC7D8"/>
particularly in the environs of the metropolis are very diſadvantageous to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of our calling. Formerly a gentleman might collect a few purſes on the road, and the danger of detection was ſo inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as not to demand a ſerious reflection; but now ſo many ſnares are laid for us, ſo many illuminations are exhibited, and ſo many bloodhounds are in purſuit of us, that I have almoſt come to a reſolution of relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing my preſent trade, and engaging in ſomething that may be leſs lucrative, but may not be attended with any fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
               <p>Mercy, my dear Madam, is an attribute fit for the gods, and, as the divine Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare affiruis, bleſſes both the giver and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver. If you would deign to have mercy upon me Madam, you might relieve me from the crimes and conſequences of depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, preſerve me from a premature and ignominious death, and by a life of purity and integrity render me a fit candidate for the realms of bleſſedneſs above.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, Madam, this may appear to you as a very ſingular mode of courtſhip. I am indeed of the ſame opinion; but as I have pointed out a plan by which you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come entitled to everlaſting happineſs, I ought to claim a little of your attention. To ſave a life would afford conſolation to a
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:035084_0186_10014B26603DDC48"/>
humane breaſt; to ſave a ſoul would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that breaſt exceedingly; but how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite would be the future rewards for ſuch exemplary pious actions!</p>
               <p>I was bred and educated as a gentleman, Madam; from my infancy I was taught to believe and expect, that when I approached the ſtate of manhood, I ſhould have been furniſhed with a liberal proviſion for my ſupport, in a mode of life to which I had been accuſtomed; but before that period arrived, death deprived me of both my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and my father, with his laſt breath, lamented he had nothing to leave me, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke into the laſt hundred of his caſh, and his acres and houſes had been long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of.</p>
               <p>Entertaining an affectionate eſteem for my father, I felt the loſs of him as a very great calamity; but loſing with him all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an independency, my ſituation was indeed deplorable. In a word, I was preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently made acquainted with my real ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that the author of my being, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he had conſumed a patrimony which was to have been tranſmitted to his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, literally broke his heart.</p>
               <p>Trained to no buſineſs, employment, or occupation, to what could I apply myſelf to procure a maintenance? Drudgery or hard labor I could not prevail on myſelf to
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:035084_0187_10014924370D3748"/>
ſubmit to, or to appear in any ſituation which might be thought degrading to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. Though educated at an univerſity, I had been too indolent to beſtow cloſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſciences, and therefore only acquired a little ſmattering in them; a little ſuperficial knowledge which it would be diſgraceful for a gentleman to be without.</p>
               <p>Deſtitute of money, reſources, or expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, I was not long in forming a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to enliſt myſelf among the cavalry. My credit was not ſo much impaired by my misfortunes, but I ſtill found I could be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with a horſe. A piſtol, and ſome other implements, adapted to the profeſſion in which I was about to engage, were ſoon procured.</p>
               <p>Thus, determined to procure a precarious ſupport, by borrowing a little from the afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, purely to preſerve exiſtence, I ſet out with great compoſure in purſuit of my daily bread.</p>
               <p>I reſolved however, before I entered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my new calling, never to exerciſe the leaſt cruelty, or to make uſe of ſuch menacing language as might create terror in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons on whom I might make a demand. This reſolution I was determined invariably to abide by, whatever might be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. In a lane, leading from Harrow to the Uxbridge road, I made my firſt eſſay; I overtook an old gentleman on horſeback.
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:035084_0188_100149276D8CB4A0"/>
and my ſalutation was an obſervation on the weather. "'Tis a fine day, ſir," ſaid I. "Very fine, indeed," replied the gentleman, of whom I meant to borrow a few pieces.</p>
               <p>I told him that diſtreſs had induced me to undertake a new buſineſs, and therefore if I did not acquit myſelf with ſo much adroitneſs as one who had been longer in practice, I hoped he would make a proper allowance for my inexperience.</p>
               <p>The traveller ſeemed alarmed, but did not perfectly comprehend my meaning. I therefore entreated him to furniſh me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly with what caſh he could ſpare, and I would gladly repay him if fortune ſhould ever put it in my power. I further inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him that any unneceſſary delay, on his part, would oblige me to produce a ſhining aſſiſtant from my pocket, which would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force obedience to my requeſt: I hoped, however, that I ſhould not be compelled to act uncivilly; but that depended on his readineſs to adminiſter to my neceſſities.</p>
               <p>The aſtoniſhed yeoman (for ſo I ſuppoſed him to be) could no longer miſunderſtand the drift of my buſineſs, and with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt expedition delivered me his purſe; in which, on examination, I found the ſum of ſeven guineas and an half. After politely taking leave of my benefactor, and thanking him for his ſeaſonable ſupply, we ſeparated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="190" facs="unknown:035084_0189_10000A18247E1E08"/>
the gentleman proceeded on his journey, and I thought it prudent to take a contrary courſe.</p>
               <p>Pleaſed with the encouragement I had met with on my firſt attempt, I began to be a little reconciled to my new calling, and meant to return immediately to the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ital; having, as I thought, a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of caſh to ſupport me for ſeveral weeks, and not intending to take the road again till neceſſity ſhould compel me ſo to do. I did not become a plunderer to enable me to launch into extravagancies and follies, but to procure a bare ſubſiſtance, and to keep me literally from ſtarving.</p>
               <p>But while my mind was occupied with theſe reflections, riding at my eaſe without apprehenſions of danger, I heard the ſound of the feet of horſes coming furiouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me; gueſſing their buſineſs with me, I ſet off full ſpeed, and we had an excellent race for about a mile and an half. At length I was overtaken, and I recognized among my purſuers, the gentleman of whom I had borrowed the yellow ſhiners.</p>
               <p>Luckily for me, I had thrown away the purſe; and though the booty I had taken was found upon me, pieces of coin cannot poſſibly be ſworn to, unleſs they have been previouſly marked. I had alſo put on a wig over my hair, which I had carried in
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:035084_0190_10000A1E2E84CC58"/>
my pocket for that purpoſe. This made ſo great an alteration in my figure, that my accuſer could not poſitively ſwear to the identity of my perſon, but ſaid he believed I was the man who had robbed him of his purſe and money.</p>
               <p>I was conducted to a place of ſafety, and the next day exhibited at a public office; where many perſons appeared who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced recent depredations. After having been minutely ſurveyed by every one preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, none of whom could charge me with any offence, I paſſed an examination before a magiſtrate, and, ſuſpicions being very ſtrong againſt me, was committed to a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſecurity, that I might receive the judgment of my peers at the approaching ſeſſion.</p>
               <p>At the tribunal of <hi>Oyer et terminer</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, was arraigned, tried, acquitted, and diſcharged.</p>
               <p>Being now perfectly at liberty, madam, I ſhould be happy to receive your commands. If you will permit me to attend you, I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf you will not think contemptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of me. Except the offence which I have mentioned to you, with all its particulars and conſequences, I know not that I have ever violated the laws of morality or ſociety. If you can overlook that ſingle crime, and ſuffer me to partake of your independence,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:035084_0191_10000A22940CD3E8"/>
you will ſave from perdition, and fill with gratitdue, the boſom of your unfortunate, but not unprincipled ſervant,</p>

The long epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Harry Hounſlow muſt have taken up many of you precious moments, and could not be a very pleaſing taſk for a perſon of your imagination. It is a ſlaviſh buſineſs, at beſt, merely to tranſcribe, though the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject may be ever ſo entertaining.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:035084_0196_10000A2E6B21E2A8"/>Happy beyond expreſſion, and wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in receiving the congratulations of my neighbors, I cannot at preſent find leiſure to keep pace with you in epiſtolary matters. When I have given audience to all my cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious viſitors, and ſubmitted to the bridal etiquette, I ſhall have it in my power to ſhew that I am not inattentive to my Belinda.</p>
               <p>What I have already ſaid will, I hope, be conſidered as a ſufficient apology for ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly informing you, that I am, and ever ſhall be,</p>

               <p>ACCEPT my congratulations, moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Louiſa, on the celebration of your nuptials! may you, and the fortunate poſſeſſor of your hand and heart, be as happy as you deſerve

to be!—Your recital of the particulars on the feſtive day of marriage, delighted me exceedingly—it conveys a pleaſing idea of northern hoſpitality, and of the gratitude of individuals, in teſtifying their joy for the happineſs of their benefactor.</p>
               <p>You deſcribe, with elegance and preciſion, the family manſion, and its agreeable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances.</p>
               <p>Your obſervations on the diverſion of angling, are ſuch as I ſhould have expected from my Louiſa. They do you honor, and are an additional proof that mercy and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, ſo amiable in a female character, inhabit your benevolent boſom.</p>
               <p>Your reaſon for becoming a pupil to your ſiſter in law, does you infinite credit; and your comparative view of the Northern and Middleſex inhabitants, is too juſt to be queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned or contradicted.</p>
               <p>I thank you for your obliging invitation to your agreeable manſion; but whether I can accept of it, depends wholly upon cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>I have followed your example, my Loui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, and am, like you, become a wife. My hand was given laſt monday to Mr. Proby; my heart was his long before. Our nuptials were ſolemnized at St. James's church, and celebrated at the Star<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Garter in Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; but not with that ſplendor and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:035084_0198_10000A354C1D1EB8"/>
which was exhibited on your bridal day.</p>
               <p>My uncle, and a few ſelect friends of both ſexes, aſſiſted at the ceremony, and paſſed the remainder of the day with us, with that cheerfulneſs and ſatisfaction, uſually attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>Believe me, my Louiſa, my happineſs is now complete, for I enjoy the full fruition of all my wiſhes. Mr. Proby is every thing that is amiable, and my uncle has been lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral beyond my expectations.</p>
               <p>A few days prior to our marriage, a long conteſted ſuit in chancery was determined, in which my worthy man was one of the parties. A decree was made in his favor, which gives him an eſtate of fifteen hundred pounds a year, beſides a conſiderable ſum in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated annuities. This cauſe has been long pending, the perſon who had uſurped the eſtate, having taken every meaſure of delay which the court of chancery would permit.</p>
               <p>Added to this, my own fortune is five hundred pounds a year real eſtate, and ten thouſand pounds in caſh; excluſive of a bank note, of a thouſand pounds value, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me by my uncle, on my wedding day; who has alſo cauſed Mr. Proby to be inducted to a valuable living.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:035084_0199_10000ACB20165EE8"/>Thus ſituated, my Louiſa, every thing that is deſirable is within my reach. Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the beſt of men, whoſe fortune unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my own, readers us independent and even affluent, we may adopt any mode of living conſiſtent with our annual income.</p>
               <p>Though Mr. Proby knew of the decree in his favor on the day it was given, he did not communicate that intelligence to me till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner on our wedding day. The news was therefore doubly welcome to me; in the firſt place, it muſt have proved to my good man, that I did not marry him on the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ore of fortune; and in the next, I was pleaſed at ſo ſudden an unexpected an acceſſion of property.</p>
               <p>You and I, my Louiſa, owe our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the fates—never were two friends more equally attended to by the blind god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, than we are!—dare you preſume to ſay, that our merits' have a claim to ſuch diſtinction?—for my own part, I candidly acknowledge that the project I engaged in, was a ridiculous one, however fortunate the event.</p>
               <p>It was ſolely owing to the caprice of the blind deity that I have been ſucceſsful; but you, my Louiſa, have ſufficient merit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title you to her beſt gifts, without creating even a ſuſpicion of partiality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:035084_0200_10000A37E74A1718"/>I am now like a turtle lamenting the loſs of my mate. Mr. Proby has been abſent from me theſe three days; his attendance being required in Northamptonſhire, on ſome material buſineſs relative to the living he is ſhortly to poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>Soon after his return, we have fixed upon a Weſtern tour, but our headquarters are to be at Bath; where we expect to paſs our time very agreeably; afterwards we ſhall reviſit the capital, and endeavor to learn from ſome of the public prints, whether any tolerable handſome manſion is to be ſold, which, (if we can find one to our taſte) we mean to purchaſe for a ſummer reſidence. We would not wiſh to have it more than fifteen miles from London, nor, leſs than ten or eleven.</p>
               <p>You muſt not be ſurprized, Louiſa, if we ſhould accept of your obliging invitation, and paſs the next ſummer with you in the North. The ſuppoſed impediment, which you mentioned in your laſt, cannot hinder Mr. Proby from accompanying me on ſuch a viſit; for, having a chaplain's ſcarf, his reſidence on his living may be diſpenſed with.</p>
               <p>You draw ſo delightful a picture of your village and its inhabitants, that I ſhould be anxious to behold ſo enchanting a ſpot, even if my Louiſa was not there; but, ſuch a
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:035084_0201_10000A3A9FC48D98"/>
magnet as you, muſt at all times, moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully attract me. Suffer me, however, to propoſe conditions upon this occaſion, which I ſhall rigidly expect to be complied with on your part, that if I pay a viſit to my Louiſa in the north, ſhe muſt accompany her Belinda on her return to the ſouth; where, during the inclemency of winter, populous cities are not without their charms. In that dreary ſeaſon, the country has loſt the power of pleaſing; grown cheerleſs by the long abſence of the enlivening ſun, life cannot be enjoyed in the northern regions, though it may be endured; the trees, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of their foilage, preſent a melancholly proſpect; the birds no longer delight the ear with their harmonious notes; the earth ceaſes to teem with her rich produce and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſteril; and the face of it often cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a mantle of ſnow. The purling ſteams are arreſted and ſilenced by the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling influence of the froſt, and all nature ſeems an univerſal blank.</p>
               <p>On the annual return of theſe gloomy and unpleaſant proſpects, my Louiſa would do well to quit the joyleſs ſcene, and direct her ſteps towards the capital; there a kind of artificial ſummer is ever to be found, and mirth and feſtivity chaſe away the thoughts of unpropitious winter, with all her haggard train. Deign thereof to make

my houſe your reſidence on theſe periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal returns, and you may rely on my pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, as frequent viſits when the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is clad in its beſt attire, when the woods are become vocal by the feathered warblers, and the zephyrs regale the ſenſes with their rich perfumes. Happy ſhall we be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally communicating our joys, and in expatiating on the virtues of our good men, who have raiſed us to an enviable ſtate of uninterrupted happineſs.</p>
