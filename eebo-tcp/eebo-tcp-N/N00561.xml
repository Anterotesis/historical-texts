            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>Truth advanced above Error: <hi>Or,</hi> A Correction of many very dangerous and hurtful Errors, entertained by some, as Articles of Sound Doctrine, which yet are false Doctrine, and contradict the holy Scriptures, relating to many of the first Principles, and chief and most necessary things of the <hi>Christian Faith</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>

                  <p>ERROR I.</p>
                  <p>THat People should not be earnest to seek after or search into further Discoveries of divine Knowledge, because (<hi>as some alledge</hi>) they know enough already, if they be faithful to what they know; And to seek or search after Knowledge of divine Mysteries, hath an evil Tendency to make People airy, proud and fantastical.</p>
                  <p>CORRECTION.</p>
                  <p>Things should be rightly distinguished; there is a right and wrong seeking and searching after Knowledge: The right seeking proceeds from a real drawing and inclination of the Spirit of God, moving Souls to seek after a further increase of divine Knowledge; and the true manner of seeking after the same, is by frequent Prayer, silent Waiting, Meditation, Reading in the holy Scriptures, and other good Books, and Conference with Pious Men, endued with good Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and by using all other helps and means, both inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by and with the aid, assistance, and help of Gods Spirit, as it is inwardly revealed and felt. And seeing we are commanded to grow both in Grace and Knowledge, we are to seek after a further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Knowledge, as well as of Grace; and as no man is so Holy, but that he may and ought to be more Holy, so is none so <hi>Knowing</hi> in the things of God, but he may still know much more; <hi>for there is no end of the Treasures of divine Knowledge and Wisdom.</hi> And though such who are unfaithful should rather be faithful to what they know, than (remaining unfaithful) to seek after more Knowledge, and that the
<pb facs="unknown:000691_0011_0FA9A0B9AF3BEB40"
                         rendition="simple:additions"/>
way to attain to further Knowledge, is to be faithful in what is already made known; yet there are many who pretend to know enough, are really very Ignorant of many necessary things, and their Ignorance is a hinderance to their faithfulness; whereas if they had more real and sollid Knowledge, it would greatly help them to be more faithful unto God; for <hi>true divine Knowledge,</hi> received in the Spirit of Truth, and held in the some, doth greatly tend to promote and increase real Holiness in men; for the more we truely know God, the more we love him; and the more we love him, we are the more Obedient unto him, and conform to the Image of his Son. And tho' it is said to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> held by many in the Church of <hi>Rome, That Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion,</hi> yet this is renounced by all true <hi>Protestants</hi>; and it is good <hi>Protestant Doctrine,</hi> That the Scriptures are to be read and searched by all, with the help of the unerring Spirit of Truth, that did dictate them, that every one may be able to give an account of the Hope that is in him. And God is a God of Knowledge, and his Spirit is called in Scripture, <hi>The Spirit of Knowledge and Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and therefore the more we know truly of God and Christ and divine Things, (if we be faithful to what we know) the more we are like unto God, <hi>True Divine Knowledge</hi> being a part of his Image. And the proper tendency of all true divine living Knowledge of God and divine Things is to make men truly Humble, sollid and weighty; but Ignorance, and dead and dry Knowledge, empty of Life, and without the true Love of God and our Neighbour, which is <hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Science,</hi> falsly so called, doth puff up into Pride, and that is only that Knowledge which <hi>Paul</hi> said <hi>doth puff up.</hi> The holy Scripture doth greatly condemn <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and aboundeth with the praise of <hi>true divine Knowledge</hi>; and the <hi>true divine Wisdom</hi> inviteth men, <hi>To search and seek after her as for hidden Treasure.</hi> And wherefore are so many great and precious <hi>divine Mysteries</hi> wrapt up in the Savings of the holy Scriptures, but that men should search after them? for as it is the Glory of God to hide a thing, it is the Glory of a King (<hi>viz.</hi> who hath overcome his Lusts and ruleth over his own Spirit) to find it out, as the Scripture declareth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And it is one great part of the Spirits Work to open the holy Scriptures, and the deep things that are testified of in them: And Christ said, <hi>There is nothing hid that shall not be revealed</hi>; and God hath promised, <hi>That Knowledge shall greatly increase, even to fill the Earth, as the Waters fill and cover the Sea</hi>;
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000691_0012_0FA9A0BA6CF14B78"/>
And the Prophets are commended in Scripture by <hi>Peter, That they searched diligently concerning the Coming of Christ, and his Sufferings, and the Time thereof, and the Glory that should follow.</hi> And therefore the right manner of seeking and searching after an Increase of true divine Knowledge, so as to understand many places of Scripture, both relating to Doctrines and Prophecies, to wit, by the help of Gods Spirit, accompanying all our endeavours, is both necessary and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; for whatever many think of their Attainments in divine Knowledge, it is most certain, there is very much doth remain to be attained, beyond what the most knowing hath as yet reached unto. And tho' men may be good <hi>Christians</hi> who are not endued with great Knowledge of divine Things, yet the first Principles of <hi>Christian Doctrine</hi> are altogether necessary to be known to every true <hi>Christian,</hi> and if any be in danger to be exalted by the abundance of <hi>Revelations,</hi> as was <hi>Paul</hi>'s case, that is not to be imputed unto <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> but unto <hi>humane Weakness,</hi> for men may also be in danger to be lifted up with their Services and Sufferings, and other good Gifts of God; which proceedeth from humane Weakness.</p>
                  <p>Error 2. <hi>That we stand by Faith, and not by Knowledge; and therefore Knowledge of divine Mysteries is not necessary, nor much desireable.</hi>

wind of Doctrine,</hi> Ephes. 4.13, 14. And experience doth abundantly prove it, That true divine sollid Knowledge (as well as Faith) is a great mean and Instrument of mens being preserved in the Truth; for who are most ready and liable to be, carried away and tossed with every wind of Doctrine, but Ignorant and Unstable Souls, whom Sathan and his Instruments deceive, for want of true divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; whereas men of sollid Knowledge and Understanding, and of a good Judgment in divine Things, are generally preserved sound and firm in the Way of Truth. And certainly <hi>Ignorance</hi> is the <hi>Mother of all Error of Vnderstanding</hi>; and as all Error is hurtful, so many Errors are exceeding hurtful to Mankind, when received. And since all Mankind is ruled and led into all their Actions by <hi>Perswasions,</hi> good or bad, it doth greatly concern all men to have <hi>sound</hi> and <hi>true Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions</hi> of things; for <hi>false Perswasions</hi> lead men to <hi>bad Actions,</hi> and the best <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Error 3. <hi>That since God doth immediately reveal and teach People what is necessary to be known, as he taught the Prophets and Apostles, therefore there is little use of the Scriptures to such, and men need not much read or meditate on what they read in the Scriptures, for attaining divine Knowledge; it will come abundantly unto them without Reading, or outward Hearing, or Meditation, by divine Inspiration in silent Waiting upon God. And such who Preach need not read the Scriptures, to be so much as an Instrument to help them to preach; for Immediate Revelation, and Immediate Teaching, to such who are come to it, maketh the Vse of all Books, and all outward Helps needless and superfluous.</hi>

                     <hi>Correction.</hi> It is a very wrong and false sence and understanding of <hi>Immediate Divine Revelation</hi> and <hi>Immediate Teaching of Gods Spirit,</hi> as if it did exclude or make void, in any measure, the use of the holy Scriptures, or any other outward means and helps of true Knowledge that God hath appointed; for the word [<hi>Immediate</hi>] is not exclusive

of means but inclusive, so that the <hi>Spirit's inward Revelation</hi> and <hi>Illumination, Operation</hi> and <hi>Influence,</hi> must be joyned with all means and Instruments used by us, otherwise they are altogether ineffectual and unprofitable. And though frequently God doth give to his dear Children a sensible and experimental Knowledge of himself, in the enjoyment of his Love, Life and Power, and divine Goodness in their hearts, so as to feel, to savour and taste of the same, that exceedeth all Words and outward Testimonies, and Means whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and is oft communicated when their is no present use made of outward Means, of any sort, but in a deep and profound inward Silence, Quiet and Stillness of Soul; yet it is not always so, but as the Lord pleaseth he doth convey to the Souls of his Children the sensible and experimental Knowledge of Himself, and most precious Tastings and Feelings of his divine Love, Life and Power, and divine Presence, sometimes in the Use of outward Hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Reading, Meditation, Prayer, and sometimes in pure silent Waiting and inward Stillness.</p>
                  <p>But for the further opening and clearing the matter, let the following Things be well and duely considered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> There is a twofold Branch of <hi>true divine Knowledge,</hi> one <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>Discursive,</hi> the other <hi>Sensible</hi> and <hi>Intuitive</hi>; These two are both most necessary to all <hi>Christians,</hi> and they contribute mutually the one to the other, and the <hi>Doctrinal Knowledge</hi> doth prepare the Soul to receive the <hi>Sensible,</hi> and is as the Husband-mans Labouring with his Instruments of Husbandry to raise Bread and other Provisions for him to eat.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Although the Knowledge of God, as a Creator, in great part, together with the Knowledge of many Duties and Sins, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us with the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (who have not the Scriptures) may be had by us, only and altogether by inward divine Revelation, without the Scriptures (as the Experience of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Philosophers doth sufficiently witness) accompanied with their using the Books of Creation and Providence, who by the same did also attain to the Knowledge of many good and precious Truths, as of the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and that there were <hi>Future Rewards for good men after Death,</hi> and <hi>future Punishments for bad men,</hi> yet the Knowledge of God in Christ, as he is come in the Flesh, and dyed for our sins and rose again for our Justification, and his Ascention into Heaven, and Intercession

And even the Prophets and Apostles in many things were helped and furthered in divine Knowledge by one another, and especially the latter by the former. But it is to be granted, that both the Prophets and Apostles were taught many things of Doctrine without all outward Teaching and Means whatsoever; but for us to presume to such a thing, as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nor is it at all safe for any in our Day to equal themselves to the Prophets and Apostles of God, who vvere made Instruments to commit to Writing the holy Scriptures, for they were extraordinarily chosen, fitted and endued to so great a Work, and had <hi>extraordinary Revelations,</hi> and vvere greater and more eminent Members in the Body of Christ than any of us are or can be. And if any think they can preach vvell enough without Reading or Meditating in the holy Scriptures: vvhen they speak in Tongues and Languages, that they never learned, and have other extraordinary Gifts, that the Prophets and Apostles had, it is time enough to believe them, but not till then; for vve find by experience, that the Words that men use in Preaching (how much soever they are endued and assisted by the Spirit) they have learned them and received them, more or less, by outward Hearing or Reading (unless it may be said, that some perhaps coyn some few words that are new and unusual) and every sentence of Scripture that they mention in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000691_0016_0FA9A0BE0EC9CFF8"/>
Preaching, they have received it either by outward Hearing or Reading, tho' oft men may forget when or how they did so receive them, and may not remember that some sayings of Scripture are really contained in the same, which hath occasioned some ignorantly to affirm, <hi>They had these Sayings and Sentences without all Hearing or Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture</hi>; which is their great mistake. God hath given the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> to be a great Blessing and Help, as to all <hi>Christians</hi> in general, so to all Preachers, that out of the same, as out of a most rich Store-house, they may be furnished with whatever is profitable unto them, to preach to People for Doctrine, <hi>That the Man of God may be perfect, and throughly furnished unto every good Work</hi>; and it pleaseth God to accompany the Scripture Words in the Mouthes of faithful Preachers, and make them as Instruments and Conduits of his Spirit, and Life, and divine Power, and Presence; and certainly he is the best and most able Minister of the Gospel who is both <hi>Mighty in the Spirit</hi> and also in the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> and hath the Spirit of God and a <hi>spiritual Gift and Ability</hi> given him in the Spirit, in a Doctrinal way to open and expound them unto People, as well as to use them in <hi>Exhortation, Reproof, Correction, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> did confess, <hi>That what was formerly writ was writ for his Learning, and his Brethren,</hi> and he desired <hi>Timothy, That together with his giving Attendance to the Gift of Gods holy Spirit in him, he would give himself also to Reading</hi>; and that surely was in the holy Scriptures, so much as then was extant.

                  <p>And whereas it hath been affirmed by some, <hi>That they have known Doctrinal Truths of the Gospel so by divine inward Revelation, that they cannot allow the Scriptures so much as to have been the Instrument of the Spirit to give them that Knowledge, and should have known these things if they had never heard men, nor read on a Book.</hi> It is certainly too great Presumption, and greater Sobriety and Moderation in that case were more becoming and safe for them; for the plain tendency of that false Perswasion is to lift up into spiritual Pride and vain Glory, and to slight and neglect those means and helps that God hath graciously provided for them.</p>

And this is the plain Doctrine of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> as is to me very plain and clear, and is made exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Comfortable unto me, by a measure of the same Spirit that dwelt in him, and did distate these gracious Words through him, Rom. 8. <hi>For whom he did Fore-know, them he did Predestinate to be Conform to the Image of his Son; and whom he did Predestinate, them he Called, and whom he Called, them he Iustified, and whom he Iustified, them he Glorified.</hi> These Words are called by some, <hi>A Golden Chain,</hi> consisting of certain very sure and firm Links, none of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the uncertain Motion of the meer indifferent Will of Man, but on the free Love and Grace of God, given to Gods Elect in Christ Jesus before the World began.

that Man should taste of it, or feed upon it, for it is of a killing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But such was the love of God to Man, that he would not have Man to know his Wrath and severe Justice, by any experience, sence, or feeling of it, as the fallen Angels had already known: He would have Man to know him in his <hi>love, wisdom, power,</hi> and all other divine Perfections and Virtues, signified by the Trees of the Garden, but not that he should feel or taste of his Wrath and severe Justice, and feed upon it; and this Man behoved to do, if he sinned against God, by turning away his love from his Maker, to the inordinate love of created things, that were below him; for this was Man's sin, his turning from God to the Creature, and from Light to Darkness, the which how soon he did, he could not but feel the Anger and severe Justice of God ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So Man by his being forbid to feed on the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, he was forbid to sin against God, by turning from God to the Creature; for Judgment and Wrath is the infallible consequent or concomitant of sin; and so by forbidding the one, he did forbid the other, as God did plead with <hi>Israel</hi> of Old, <hi>Turn ye, Turn ye, why will ye dye?</hi> for Sin brings Wrath and Death upon men. And as it is common for Parents to say to Children, <hi>Beware of the Rod, lest ye taste of it,</hi> which is equivolent with that, <hi>Do not Disobey.</hi> And thus the Lord by <hi>Moses</hi> set before the Children of <hi>Israel Good and Evil, Life and Death, saying, Chuse Life that thou mayst live.</hi> Now the same that is Life to the Obedient, is Death to the Sinner; The <hi>Word</hi> is one, but hath a twofold Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, One of Life, to refresh and comfort the Obedient, Another of Wrath and Death, as a two-edged Sword to kill and afflict the Sinner; The one is the Property of Goodness, Mercy and Love, the other, of Severity, Wrath and Anger, which are one in the Word, but branching forth in a two-fold Property, as to men, according to the words in the <hi>Psalm,</hi> duely translated out of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, <hi>Psal.</hi> 62.11, 12. <hi>God hath spoke one, two I have heard, Mercy belongeth unto God, and also Power,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Power of his severe Iustice and Wrath</hi> (for so the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word doth signifie) <hi>for he will render to every man according to his Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now what that sin was that the Serpent tempted Man to commit, may be understood by the like Tentation, wherewith he ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And whereas after man's Fall, God said, <hi>Behold, Man is become like one of us, knowing Good and Evil,</hi> it was true that God said, but not in the Devil's sence, who deceived Man with a Lye and Equivocation; for after Man had sinned, he felt the Property of Wrath and Anger awakened in him, which he knew not before, and found himself to be an Angry Man, and in some sort he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like unto God,<note place="margin">

Jesus) <hi>cometh the Resurrection of the Dead.</hi> And as the Resurrection is that of the Body, as well as of the Soul, so the Death is the Death of the Body, as well as of the Soul; for when Man sinned, his sin defiled both his Soul &amp; Body, and therefore the Wrath of God was kindled against both, and both were to partake of the Punishment; for not only the Soul of Man suffered a great Degeneration from its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Glory, but the Body also; <hi>So that Man being in Honour, and not abiding, became like the Beasts that perish,</hi> as the Scripture declareth. And seeing Mans Body before the Fall was not subject to any sort or Sickness or Death, it doth argue that the Glory of it before the Fall was very great, and indued with many excellent Gifts and Abilities of Beauty, Strength, Vigour, Agility, and quickness of Perception, far beyond what we are able to understand, being made Lord over all the visible Creation, and Works of Gods hands, as the prime Master-piece of his Workmanship, and crowned with Glory and Honour, as the Scripture declareth; and yet the glory of Mans Body before the Fall was exceeding inferiour to the glorified Body of Christ in Heaven, and to the glorified Bodies of the Saints at the Resurrection of the Dead; for his body was not spiritual, but Annimal; and being compared with Christ, as Man, he was but as a Figure, or Type of him that was to come, as <hi>Paul</hi> declareth, and was <hi>an Earthy Man, of the Earth Earthly,</hi> whereas <hi>Christ is the Heavenly Man, of the Heaven Heavenly,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>And as we have born the Image of the Earthy, so we shall bear the Image of the Heavenly.</hi> But even the Image of the Earthy was very glorious before the Fall; for tho' God made him of the Dust of the Ground, yet that Dust was not common Dust, but much more pure and refined than that of which the Bodies of Men since the Fall were made of.</p>
                  <p>Nor should it be strange, that <hi>Adam's</hi> Body (if he had not sinned) should not have dyed, but have been Immortal, tho' made of the Dust, when we believe that the Bodies of the Saints at the Resurrection of the Dead, sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But though <hi>Adam</hi> was not to have dyed a Bodily Death, if he had not sinned, yet it is not to be doubted but his Body in due time should have been changed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all his Posterity, from <hi>Earthly</hi> to <hi>Heavenly,</hi> and from <hi>Annimal</hi> to <hi>Spiritual</hi>; for such is the goodness of God towards his Creatures, that they are still to ascend to a higher Perfection, and

                  <p>Now if any will contend, <hi>That this Change which</hi> Adam <hi>was to undergo, was to be a sort of Death</hi>; I will not contend with them about words, for I love not to strive about words; but I say, it was not to be such a Death as Men now dye; nor do I find any thing in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to warrant why it should be called Death.</p>

And ever since the Fall, the Condition of Man's Bodily Life is such, that he is continually subject to the danger of Death; and so soon as Man is born, and begins to live in the World, he begins to dye; so that, as some wise Men have observed, Man's Life in this World is a <hi>Dying Life</hi> and a <hi>Living Death,</hi> according to the words, <hi>Dying thou shalt dye,</hi> see the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Besides, so great a Death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Soul of Man by his Transgression, it could not but greatly

And to show the weakness of this Objection, that hath weight with many, it is generally acknowledged, That <hi>Adam</hi> needed no Garments or Cloathing before the Fall, and that our need of Cloathing, both to preserve us from Cold, and cover our Nakedness, is an Effect and Consequent of the Fall; and yet it will not follow that therefore such who have attained to a Freedom from Sin (by the Grace and Power of God) are to lay aside all use of Cloathing, and go Naked, altho' some Ungodly Persons have so practised, taking their ground from the like Reasoning.</p>

the Vail is done away, and <hi>Moses</hi> Face is clearly seen, by such who are well taught in the School of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Now according to the Tenor of the Allegory, the <hi>Beasts of the Field</hi> are the <hi>Fallen Angels,</hi> which were without the Garden, as common Fields are without Gardens; and the <hi>Serpent</hi> that deceived <hi>Eve</hi> was one of the worst of these fallen Angels, to wit, the most Naked or Subtil of any of them.</p>

Which cannot be outward and material Rivers, all rising from one Original River, for no such thing is to be found, as any material River dividing itself into four Branches, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the four Quarters of the Earth, and watering them; but the whole Passage is an Allegory, and the four fold Influence of the Spirit of God may well be understood to be four Rivers, as well as four Winds, according to <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.9. and the Waters of the Sanctuary running North, East, South, West, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. throughout.</p>
                  <p>But whereas some imagine, That <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> was that Paradise or Garden wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was placed, they are under a great Mistake, for <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> as is well known to all Geographers) lyeth only betwixt two Rivers, (to wit, <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi>) and not four;

And she was called <hi>Isha</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, which is to say, <hi>Taken from Man</hi>; for at first God made them Male and Female in one Flesh or Body, and aftewards divided them. But whether this Division or Seperation was made before or after the Fall, is much questioned by many, They who think it was after the Fall, bring this Reason for it, <hi>Because, Gen.</hi> 2.18. <hi>it is declared, that God said, It is not good that the Man should be alone, I will make man an Help meet for him.</hi> Now, how came Man to be alone, seeing at first they were made together, Male and Female, in One, and God blessed them with the Blessing of Fruitfulness, that they might multiply and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenish the Earth? Also, seeing that God saw all that he had made, <hi>and it was very Good,</hi> as he first made every thing; how then cometh it, that it was not good for Man to be as he then was, if Sin had not occasioned a great Change in him? For it is not to be supposed that God is like to a Man, that maketh a piece of Work, and when he hath made it, doth not please him, as he at first made it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore putteth it into another fashion. From all which they conclude, That the Woman being seperated from the Man, was a consequent of the Fall, and that therefore it was not good that Man should be alone, to wit, that his Wife should remain barren in him; for the Effect of then Fall was such, That they could not multiply their Species in one body, as they might have done, if the Fall had not been.

                  <p>To this they readily give <hi>Answer,</hi> That it doth no more lessen the due esteem of Marriage, to say, <hi>it was not ordained in Paradise,</hi> than to say, It shall be no Ordinance in the Kingdom of Heaven, after the Resurrection of the Dead, which Christ hath plainly taught us, <hi>That the Children of this World Marry and give in Marriage, but the Children of the Resurrection marry not, nor give in Marriage, neither do they dye any more.</hi> From all which some gather, That Marriage is an Ordinance of God, as a Remedy for Death; for if Marriage were not, Mankind could not be preserved upon Earth, in the regular and due way as God hath appointed. And it is sufficient to preserve the due Honour and Esteem of Marriage, that it is, without all doubt, the Ordinance of God to Men, during this Mortal state. And since Paradise was no part of this visible Globe of the Earth, it may well enough be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s state in Paradise belonged not to this World, that is full of Trouble, where <hi>all things under the Sun are Vanity,</hi> as the Spirit of God hath declared by <hi>Soloman.</hi> Nor should it seem strange, that some of the Effects and Consequences of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall should be related by <hi>Moses,</hi> before the Cause of it; for this is very usual and common in all Writers, yea, <hi>Moses</hi> useth the same Method a little after in the same Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> for in the tenth Chapter he telleth of the <hi>several Tongues of the Children of</hi> Noah; and yet in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 11th Chapter following, he telleth, <hi>That the whole Earth was of one Language,</hi> and so proceedeth to tell what was the Cause or occasion of the dividing of the Languages.</p>

VVorld's Making, were Natural Dayes, such as our common Dayes from Sun setting to Sun rising again.</hi> But as both <hi>Origine</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> and many others have well observed, it could not be natural Dayes, for there was no Firmament till the second Day, nor dry Earth till the third day, nor Sun, Moon or Stars till the fourth day; and therefore these Dayes were not common Natural Dayes, but are mystically to be understood; for God called the <hi>Light</hi> Day, and the <hi>Darkness</hi> he called Night, and therefore every one of these six Days is Light, and not the precise time of twenty four Hours betwixt sun and sun.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it is said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>That God planted the Garden East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in</hi> Eden, many Translators do translate the word, <hi>from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> from whence <hi>Ierom,</hi> and others do conclude, That <hi>Paradise,</hi> or that Garden was no part of this visible World or System; for the most glorious part of this visible System is the Firmament, Sun, Moon and Stars; and the Firmament was made the second Day, and the Sun, Moon and Stars the fourth day.</p>
                  <p>And they do as greatly Err who say, <hi>This visible World was made of Nothing</hi>; for as no place of Scripture saith so any where, but doth contradict it, so it is a most improper manner of Speech, seeing of Nothing nothing can be made; for Nothing is no cause of any thing: Whatever is a Cause, must have some Being it self.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning the Making of this World, <hi>Moses</hi> giveth us the Account, <hi>How that the Earth was without Form, and void,</hi> in the Hebrew it is <hi>Toha va Bohu,</hi> and in the Septuagint it is <hi>Aoratos,</hi> i. e. <hi>Invisible,</hi> according to which it is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Things that are seen, or Visible, were not made of Things Apparent.</hi> So that this whole visible World did proceed or come from some-what Invisible.

Man's sake</hi>; some run so far into the Extream of an Allegory, that by the Earth that was cursed, and was to bring forth Thornes and Thistles for Mans sin, the outward and visible Earth was by no means to be understood, not in any tollerable sence or respect, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That Thornes and Thistles being a part of the Creation, are good Creatures after their kind, as other Herbs and Veget<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this proceedeth from great Ignorance; for at this rate they might as well say, the Frogs and Lice, with other Plagues and Judgments inflicted upon <hi>Pharoah</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> were only within them, and not without them, for Frogs and Lice are a part of the Creation, as other Annimals are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But first it may be questioned, Whether all Vegetables and Annimals, that are now in being, were created or made upon the Earth, before <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall, or only the more perfect sort of Vegetables &amp; Animals? for it is certain that Mules were not from the beginning, being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of an unnatural Mixture of a Horse and an Ass? But <hi>secondly,</hi> waving that part of the Question, Whether Thorns and Thistles did grow on the Earth before <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, it is most certain that Barrenness and Unfruitful Seasons came as Judgments upon the Earth for mens sins; for the Scripture declareth, <hi>That God turneth the fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Land into a barren Wilderness for the sins of Men that dwell therein:</hi> and Experience proveth it, That the Land of <hi>Iudea</hi> is not near so fruitful as formerly it was; and it is the Nature of barren <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </hi>; it holds forth, That even such a part of the Earth, as <hi>Adam</hi> should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring forth Corn for Bread, should together with Corn bring forth plenty of Weeds, as Experience fully proveth. And as the Frogs and Lice that were sent to the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> were the Works of God, (but as the Effects of his Wrath &amp; Displeasure) so the like may be said of the Thornes and Thistles that these parts of the Earth, (which Man was to have Tilled) were to bring forth, as they are the Works of God, so they were the Judgments of God, and the Effects of his Wrath; as the like may be said of great Devastations by Floods, Thunder, Lightning, Earth quakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

into the Kingdom of God; for if Children were sanctified from the Womb, and that all Infants were Saints, while Infants, surely more of it would appear in them, than doth, and the favour of the divine Life (which is in all that are sanctified) would be more savoured in them, by all who have a spiritual Discerning &amp; Savour in themselves; but the contrary is so far true, that in most of Children, before they pass the Years of Infancy, many Godly P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Inclinations that appear in many Children, not past the Years of Infancy, are to lye, to steal, to fight and speak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savoury words, which they are more ready to learn than what is good.</p>
                  <p>Next, As to the Scriptures Testimony, it is plain, <hi>That in</hi> Adam <hi>all dye, and that by that One Offence, Iudgment is come upon all unto Condemnation.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> doth plainly acknowledge, <hi>That he was shapen in Iniquity, and in Sin did his Mother conceive him,</hi> Psal. 51.5. And therefore our Flesh that we receive from our Parents, is called by <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>The Flesh of Sin</hi>; for he said, <hi>God sent his Son in likeness of the Flesh of Sin</hi> (so the <hi>Greek</hi>) and that under the Law the fore-skin of the Flesh in Infants was to be cut off by Circumcision, and an Offering was to be made for them; and the Mother doth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prove the Defilement of Nature in them, and that a Principle or Seed of Sin and Evil is lodged in them; which even <hi>Plato</hi> a Heathen Philosopher did acknowledge, saying, <hi>There was an ingrafted or innate Evil in men,</hi>

Nor is it a sufficient Argument against the Doctrine, because it is difficult to many to satisfie their Reason how this Defilement or Corruption is conveyed from <hi>Adam,</hi> and other intermediate Parents, to the Children; for there are many other things that are true, and necessary to be believed and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, and yet all, or perhaps most cannot satisfie their Reason about them.</p>

And though the Soul of Christ, as Man, was and is incomparably more excellent than all Souls of Men, yet he hath in his Soul all that is essential to the Soul of Man, <hi>being made like to us in all things, but without sin.</hi>

for the sins of men, so as to be a <hi>Sacrifice of Attonement</hi> unto God for them, required his taking on him a Body of Flesh; and therefore when he said, <hi>He came down from Heaven not to do his own will,</hi> that cannot be meant simply the Godhead of Christ, who hath no Will superior unto him to obey or fulfill; but the <hi>soul</hi> of Christ (tho' united to the Godhead by a most excellent and admirable Union) hath a superior Will and Power above it, which is that of the Godhead, in which he doth alwayes obey and fulfill the Will of God; and therefore the <hi>soul,</hi> of Christ being in most excellent and admirable Union with the eternal Word or Godhead, descended from Heaven to take Flesh in the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Womb.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning <hi>Christs Body of Flesh</hi> which he did take up or assume, though it dyed, and was buried, yet it rose again; for even <hi>his Flesh saw no Corruption,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> plainly declareth and proveth out of <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.10. And as Christ prophesied of his Body, <hi>Destroy</hi> (or rather as it should be translated from the <hi>Greek) Dissolve this Temple, and I will raise it up again the third day:</hi> And in the same Body wherein he suffered Death on the Cross, and which was buried, he rose again, and showed himself to his Disciples, and the Print of the Nails and Spear, and after forty days in the same Body did ascend into Heaven, in the sight of the Disciples; <hi>for having once dyed, he dyeth no more,</hi> and therefore did not lay down his Body again; I say, the Body of Christ is the same now in Heaven, as it was on Earth, both before and after he suffered, as in respect of substance, or the true Essence, Being and Nature of a Body, though it is wonderfully changed in Manner and Condition, having put off all these Infirmities, that it did assume for our sake, and is a most glorious heavenly spiritual Body, according to which the Bodies of the saints shall be made conform at the Resurrection of the Dead. And seeing Christs Body, that he had of the Virgin, which ascended into Heaven (together with his soul) did not come down from Heaven, (altho' his soul did descend from Heaven) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a great Error to say, <hi>That nothing of Christ, or belonging to Christ did ascend to Heaven, but that which came from Heaven</hi>; the Scripture saith no such thing any where; but thus it saith, <hi>He who ascended is the same that descended,</hi> to wit, the same Christ, who was before the Body was, did both descend and ascend, but his Body did not descend with him, when he ascended; for it was formed in the Virgins Womb, and conceived by the miraculous Operation of the holy Ghost,

and that Body had in it really of the Virgins Flesh and Nature, as also, it had in it some-what more excellent.

And although the Righteousness, Holiness and Obedience of true <hi>Christians</hi> be the more excellent above that of the best <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet it is not the Foundation or Ground of their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but (at best) Conditions and Instruments requisite thereunto; But Christ Jesus, as he was a Sacrifice and Offering for us without us, and became obedient unto Death, and fulfilled the Law and Will of God for us, as he is inwardly revealed, and the Mystery of his Death and Obedience is opened to us and applyed by the Spirit of Christ, is the Foundation of our Justification before God, not only for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins past, but also to render us, and our whole Gospel Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience acceptable unto God, in our most perfect and advanced state in Holiness; for it is still through and in Christ that we are accepted of God, who is our Propitiation and Attonement, <hi>who is made unto us of God Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption.</hi> For the best works of Righteousness or Holiness that we can perform unto God, even by the help of his Grace and Spirit, is not the Foundation or Ground either of our Justification or Faith; for that were to set up another Foundation than Christ Jesus; whereas there is no other Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation but Christ alone; but to the end that he may be our Foundation, and his Righteousness may be imputed to us, and all our sins freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us for his sake, we must have Faith in him, and have the true Work of Repentance, and Conversion from Sin to Righteousness wrought in us, and in time to come we must walk in Obedience unto him. And therefore in order to obtain Justification and Remission of all sin, Faith is not only required, but Repentance, and Conversion from Sin to Righteousness, and Holiness, and true Gospel! Obedience, and good Works proceeding from a living Faith, the which Faith hath

for its Object and Foundation, Christ, both without us, as he became a Sacrifice and Attonement for our sins, and also as he liveth, and dwelleth, and ruleth in us.</p>
                  <p>And that <hi>our best Obedience,</hi> even when performed by the help of the Spirit of Christ in us, is not our alone Righteousness, whereby we are wholly and perfectly justified in the sight of God, is most clear and evident from the holy Scripture; for <hi>that Obedience</hi> only can perfectly and wholly justifie us, that hath been even performed by us unto God since the first Moment of our Life, wherein we were capable to do either good or evil, but no such Obedience can be found to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by any Man, except the Lord Jesus Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>for all have sinned and fallen short of the Glory of God,</hi> as the Scripture declareth. And seeing we all owe a continual Obedience unto God, by which only men can be justified, and that none have given it from first to last, and that the Obedience which we perform unto God, after Conversion, can be no Satisfaction nor Recompence for our many sins past, therefore what is wanting in our Obedience, as to time past (or any time afterwards, when we sin through frailty, upon our hearty and sincere Repentance, and Faith, and new Obedience) must be supplyed unto us by the most perfect Obedience and Righteousness of Christ imputed unto us.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning <hi>Imputed Righteousness,</hi> it is a Scripture phrase, and should be owned in its place, as well as that <hi>inward Work of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> wrought in us by the Spirit of Christ; for it is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the Seed &amp; Root or Nature of these things was not wholly removed &amp; destroyed in them, therefore such an Exhortation was seasonable unto them; for as the Seed and Root of a Plant, is one thing, &amp; the Leaves, Blossom and Fruit, is another, and the Seed and Root may be in a Ground, where it beareth neither Leaf, Blossom nor Fruit, being hindered and suppressed by something contrary to its growth, so sin may be and is, in many, in the Seed and Root and inward Nature of it, and may be felt to stir and move, in some measure, to the Souls grief and burden, and yet not be suffered to bring forth its Acts either of sinful Thoughts, Words or Deeds; and yet, where the Root and Nature of Sin doth remain in any, so long as it doth there remain, they cannot be said to have attained the perfect Freedom from sin, although by the Grace of God, many, to Gods Praise, have attained to that degree in Sanctification and Mortification, that sin doth not reign in their mortal Bodies, but Christ doth much more reign &amp; rule in them, even when they are but Young, and as Children, and of no great growth and experience in the Truth; and where Christ beginneth to reign and rule in his People, he doth it gradually, and by degrees his Rule and Government encreaseth in his People, &amp; by degrees he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh his and their Souls Enemies; and when, at times, any thing of offence cometh to pass, he executeth his Righteous Judgments against it, and his spiritual Sword is drawn to slay the transgressing Nature, and his spiritual Fire is kindled to burn it up.</p>
                  <p>And of this gradual Procedure and Progress of the Work of Christ in his People, there are many places of Scripture that witness to it, and many Similitudes, and Figures, and Allegories in Scripture, that hold it forth; as the Wars that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the People of <hi>Israel</hi> had with the People of the Land, on both sides of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and their many Kings and Lords that they had to conquer and overcome, in all, no less Number than Forty two, whereof <hi>Moses,</hi> with the People, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came on the other side of <hi>Iordan,</hi> namely, <hi>Syhon,</hi> King of <hi>Heshbon,</hi> and <hi>Og,</hi> King of <hi>Bashon,</hi> (now <hi>Heshbon</hi> is an Hebrew word, and signifieth <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Bashan</hi> signifieth the Teeth, and is a manifest Allegory) and after these two great Kings were overcome by <hi>Moses,</hi> on the other side of <hi>Iordan, Ioshua</hi> had no less than thirty one more, and five or six Lords of the <hi>Philistians,</hi> all which he overcame in his time, yet not without a great and long War with them, as is expresly said, <hi>Ios.</hi> 11.18. Joshua <hi>made War a long time with all those Kings</hi>; and even unto <hi>Davids</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:000691_0086_0FA9A21971427170"/>
time, the King of the <hi>Iebusites,</hi> who possessed <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, but they still possessed it, until <hi>David</hi> overcame them; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving overcome <hi>Ierusalem's</hi> Inhabitants, being the last, who were <hi>Iebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,</hi> (the <hi>Iebusites</hi> signifie, Tredders under feet) there God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Temple to be built, for a place of Worship unto him; but the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> were not without the Worship of God before that time, although that place was not conquered until <hi>David</hi> did it, and yet not <hi>David,</hi> but <hi>Solomon</hi> built the Temple; and the Rich Materials of Gold and Silver, that built the Temple, were the Spoils that were taken from the Inhabitants of the Land, and partly from the <hi>Egyptians</hi>; all which were Figures &amp; Types of great Mysteries; and it is generally understood and acknowledged, that these outward Wars that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Israel</hi> had against these Nations under <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> were Types and Figures of the inward and spiritual Wars that the Souls of Men have, under their Leader and Captain, the <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> against the Lusts that war against the Soul.</p>
                  <p>And whereas some belonging to these Nations were spared, as the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and that even all the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were not quite drove out, but some of them were suffered to remain among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> hath not the signification, which some ignorantly conceive, <hi>viz. That some sins and lusts, that are evil and sinful, do and must remain in the best of Saints for term of Life,</hi> but hath indeed another signification, as namely, the Annimal Affections and Annimal Thoughts &amp; Desires, that are not in themselves (simply considered) evil and sinful, as neither Annimal and Bodily Senses and Functions of the mortal Body, though in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing State they are defiled, yet to Believers in Christ Jesus, they are cleansed &amp; sanctified, and made serviceable to the Lord, and to his Truth, and Seed and People, as the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were made seaviceable to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> and some others besides, that were spared, yea, the Cattle of some of these Nations, and their Goods were to be saved, and not wholly destroyed; whereas all the Cattle and Goods of some others, were wholly to be destroyed, and nothing to be reserved; all which are plain Figures of spiritual Mysteries, and have a spiritual Signification, which I shall not here enlarge upon.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Lord Jesus Christ in his spiritual appearance in his People is promised <hi>To be as a Refiners Fire, and as Fullers Soap, and that he shall sit as a Refiner, and Purifier of Silver, and he shall purifie the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>and purge them as Gold and Silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:000691_0087_0FA9A21A2FFA5D28"/>
Offering in Righteousness.</hi> Now it is well known that the Fullers Soap taketh some time to cleanse a Garment, or Cloth that is defiled; and a Mass or Lump of Silver and of Gold, that hath a great mixture of Dross in it, requireth a time to have it perfectly and wholly refined &amp; seperated from the Dross; and with allusion to the Refiner of Silver and Gold, it is promised, <hi>That Christ shall sit as a Refiner,</hi> implying his Patience and Continuance in that work till it be perfectly done, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pure Gold is said to be <hi>seven times tryed,</hi> and Silver the like, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. And Christ compared the <hi>Kingdom of God to a little Leaven that a Woman did take and hide in three Measures of Meal till all be leavened</hi>; and the whole mass or lump of Meal is not instantly leavened, but requires some considerable time. And also, Christ said to his Disciples, <hi>If ye had Faith as a Grain of Mustard-Seed, ye should say to this Mountain, Be removed, and cast into the Sea, and it should be done</hi>; which Mountain, what else is it but sin, that hath had place in mens hearts as a great Mountain, and Faith removeth it, yet not commonly at once, but gradually, as the <hi>little Stone</hi> destroyeth the <hi>Image</hi> by degrees, and then becometh a great Mountain, and filleth the Earth. And <hi>Faith</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>Grain of Mustard Seed,</hi> because the Mustard-Seed, though little in quantity, yet is great in Virtue, and is Medicinal. And as the Souls gradual freedom from sin, through Faith in the Power of the Lord Jesus Christ, is compared to a <hi>Warfare</hi> in Scripture, so it is compared to divers other things, that require some considerable time, as to a <hi>Husbandry,</hi> a <hi>Building,</hi> and also, to a <hi>Iournying</hi> or <hi>Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from one remote place to another. And it is generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the sojourning of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> throu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h the red Sea and the Wilderness, was a figure of the spiritual Travail of the Soul from Sin to Holiness, and through the Unbelief of the People made their Journying much longer, than it would otherwise have been; yet if they had been duely faithful, it required some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable time. And Christ in the Parable concerning the Return of the Prodigal to his Fathers House, holds it forth as a considerable long Journey from a far Country; and it is said, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.20. <hi>When he was yet a great way off, his Father saw him, and had Compassion, and ran and fel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="unknown:000691_0088_0FA9A21AF0E87E18"/>But, <hi>lastly,</hi> The Work of God in the hearts of his People, is not only compared to a <hi>formation</hi> or <hi>generation</hi> of the Birth in the Mothers Belly, which requireth some considerable time before it be perfectly formed, but also to <hi>Gods Work of Creation,</hi> wherein six days he made Heavens and Earth; and waving altogether that part of the Question, <hi>What dayes these were, whether common and natural days?</hi> it is clear from the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that our Perfection in Christ is understood to be that <hi>Sabbath</hi> or <hi>Rest</hi> into which Believers do enter, and whereof they have not a full Possession until they have laboured and wrought with God through a Week of six days, in order to attain to that blessed Sabbath, therefore he thus exhorts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Let us labour therefore to enter into that Rest,</hi> although he, and others to whom he writes, were at that time true Believers in Christ; and indeed, there is a plain and manifest Analogy betwixt each days work in the outward Creation, and every days work of the New Creation of God in our Souls, as we are Workers together with him, which here I shall not insist upon to describe, but refer to a particular Head at the end of this Treatise. Now as in the seventh day it is said, <hi>God ended (or perfected) his Works which he had made,</hi> so in the seventh spiritual Day of Christs Appearance in us, he doth perfect his Work, but not till then: And are not many come to the first days Work, and no further? others are come to the second, others to the third, and so onwards to the sixt. And that the Work of Salvation from Sin, is gradual, and is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated how soon it is begun, is clear from the words of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> encourageing some to whom he writ, <hi>That God who had begun his good Work in them will perform it, untill the Day of Christ,</hi> Phil. 1.6 And said the same Apostle, writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> cap. 13.11. <hi>Now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed</hi>; which shewe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But for the further understanding of the <hi>Doctrine of Perfection,</hi> and the <hi>Souls Travail in the way towards it,</hi> take these following short Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations:</p>

although another part that did belong to that mass, is imperfect, and hath a great mixture of Dross, so the Faith, Love and Hope, and all other Virtues, that are of Gods begetting and working in his People, are <hi>Perfect,</hi> in that sence, that is to say, they have no Sin nor Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment belonging to them, although there may be Sin and Defilement in a Man that hath, in measure, these Virtues; for that Poor Man that said unto Christ, <hi>Lord, I believe, help my Vnbelief,</hi> had both true Faith and Unbelief in him at one time, although Virtue and Vice cannot be together in one man, in any intense or strong degree; and where true Faith, Love, Hope, and other Virtues have place in any Man, the Sins and Vices, even in respect of the Roots and Natures of them, are drove into a Corner, and are not suffered to reign.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> There are many sorts of Sins, the which if acted outwardly with the Body, or if loved and entertained in the Soul, do certainly kill the Souls Life, as to God; and whoever doth commit them cannot be said to remain sanctified, or to retain any degree of true Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, such as <hi>Drunkenness, Theft, Murder, Adultery,</hi> and all such gross things. But there are other sins, and sinful weaknesses and blemishes, that though they do not kill the Souls Life, as unto God, yet wound it, and weaken it, and the least sin that is burdens and hurts the tender Plant of Righteousness where-ever it is planted in any, and where-ever it is suffered to act so much as in a thought or word, it clouds and vails the Soul in measure, and defileth it; for the least sin is a defiling and hurtful Nature.</p>

                  <p>But as I have nothing against the Doctrine of Perfection, as a thing possible to be attained in this Mortal Life, by the Grace of Christ, so I greatly dislike that any should imagine they are come to it, who are very short of it; and I do judge it is a very great Error, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hurtful to hold it for Doctrine, <hi>That every one that hath the least measure of true Christianity, or Faith, or Sanctification, is perfectly sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, washed and cleansed</hi>; The plain tendency of which is to drive some to Presumption, and others to Desparation; for some are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally more inclined to presume than others, and to think too much of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>mselves; and these who believe this Doctrine, will conclude, (if they feel the least degree of Sanctification) they are <hi>Perfect</hi>; for according to this most false and absurd Doctrine, there is no middle State or Condition betwixt <hi>perfectly Holy</hi> and <hi>perfectly Vnholy, perfectly Carnal</hi> and <hi>perfectly Spiritual,</hi> every one is <hi>perfect Gold</hi> or <hi>perfect Dross</hi>; for there is no mixture of Gold and Dross in one Vessel, according to this false Doctrine. Others again, who are more naturally fearful, and jealous, receiving this absurd Doctrine, because they feel some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of Sin and Unholiness remaining in them; will conclude, they have nothing of Holiness in them at all, nothing of Faith, nothing of Hope, nothing of Virtue, they are wholly without, they have wholly lost their Condition; and because they feel some Malady or Distemper in them, therefore they have nothing of Health or Soundness; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the feet are unclean, and need washing, therefore neither hand nor head, nor any part in them hath any Purity in the least. But this is far contrary to Christs Doctrine, which saith, <hi>He who is clean needeth not safe to wash his feet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But some who hold this absurd Doctrine, have some seeming Reasons and Arguments for what they say, as 1<hi>st.

and Christ are present, and at work in all men, in order to save them. But the Vanity and Folly of this Argument may easily appear by the like Reasonings: A Man burneth his House in one hour, and the King taketh Compassion on the Man, and buildeth up his House again, but not in one Hour, but in some Days, Weeks or Moneths, Therefore the Man is greater and stronger than the King. A Child woundeth himself mortally with a Knife in one instant, but the skillfull Physi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ian doth not cure him till after some days, and therefore the Child is stronger than the Man. But to answer more directly, I say, it is one thing what God can do, and another thing what God willeth to do: That God can perfectly heal and cleanse the Soul from all sin in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or instant, none will deny, but it is not his Will so to do, and he seeth not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

times in <hi>Iordan,</hi> in order to be cleansed of his Leprosie, (as accordingly he did) but to point at the gradual cleansing of the Soul, as it is not only once or twice, but seven times washed in the spiritual <hi>Iordan,</hi> or River of Judgment, the Number Seven being a perfect Number, answering to the seventh Day and seventh Year, which was Sabbatical But I answer further, Although Christs curing outward Diseases was a Figure and Sign of his curing mens Souls, as to the Substance, yet not as to all the Circumstances thereof; for, 1<hi>st,</hi> Many were cured of their Bodily Diseases, and some raised from the dead to Life, without any thing on their part, in way of concurrance, but were meerly passive, as those who were raised from the dead, &amp; healed of Madness, having unclean Spirits cast out of him. 2<hi>dly,</hi> Christ cured them commonly by his Bodily Touch, and Voice of Words uttered with his Bodily Mouth, and by his Bodily Presence with them for most part, his divine Power working invisibly therewith, and he who cured them, they saw him, and heard him with Bodily Organs; but it is not so now with all whose Souls he cureth; for many Thousands have been cured by his great Power, who have neither outwardly seen nor heard him, but only believed in him. 3<hi>dly,</hi> These whom he Bodily cured remained still mortal Men, and subject to following Diseases, and Bodily Death it self; but the Souls of many are so cured and healed by Christ, that they never dye any more, but remain forever sensible of that Immortal Life and Power that first quickened them. And though Christs curing and healing the Souls of his People be gradual, and not all done at once, yet it is done effectually and perfectly in his own time, as the Souls of the Patients are faithful and careful to observe his Commands.

And even as in Natural Children, there are frequently divers things faulty and blame-worthy, which a tender Father passeth by, and easily pardoneth, when the Child retaineth true Love to him; so in such who are but as Children in the Truth, there are too often divers things faulty, and blame-worthy, yet because they retain true Love to God in measure, he doth not reject them, but own them in their Childish state.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning these words in <hi>Iohn [He who is born of God sinneth not, &amp;c.]</hi> It is to be considered, that to be throughly and entirely born of God, is an high state, and doth not belong to all who may be called (in a Scripture sence) Children, as in the Childs state; for to be throughly born of God, is to be wholly renewed and sanctified, so as to have nothing of the Flesh or unrenewed Nature remaining in

                  <p>And as concerning that other Doctrine, <hi>That none are to preach Christ to others, but who are perfectly free from all Sin in Thought, Word and Deed:</hi> It were indeed greatly to be wished that there were many such Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and all Preachers should have some real Experience of a good Work of God begun in them, and be in some measure truely sanctified, and free of all scandal in Life and Conversation. But to say, that none but such as are wholly perfected, and free from the least sin or blemish, hath no warrant from Scripture, as if the least sinful defect or blemish did altogether unminister them, or make them fall from their Ministry; for though <hi>Iudas</hi> fell from his Ministry by Transgression, because it was of a heinous sort, yet so did not all the Disciples, who had some Weaknesses, divers of them, as is recorded; for if the least sinful weakness doth take from a man his Ministry, then <hi>Moses</hi>'s Trespass at the Waters of Strife did take his Ministry from him, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did take away the Ministry from one of them at least; for one, if not both, were faulty; and that for which <hi>Peter</hi> was reproved by <hi>Paul,</hi> did take away his Ministry; al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And when Christ was taken up Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily into Heaven, while the Disciples lookt stedfastly towards Heaven, as he went up, it is said, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Behold, two Men stood by them in white Apparel,</hi> (whether these were Angels, or some of the Saints that arose after Christs Resurrection, I shall not meddle here to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine) <hi>which also said, Ye Men of</hi> Galilee, <hi>why stand ye gazing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But seeing Christ is in Heaven in the intire glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nature of Man, both in Soul and Body, and in that Nature is Head and King of the Saints, it doth add (not a little) to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Happiness of the Saints, that they shall not only know, see and enjoy him inwardly with the Eyes of their Souls, but that they shall also know, see and enjoy him without them, seeing him Bodily with the Eyes of their Resurrection Bodies, which shall be made able to behold him. And though the Wicked shall be raised also in vile and dishonourable Bodiee, and shall be made to see him, yet it shall be in another manner then the Saints shall see him, for it shall be to their great Trror and Torment; therefore it is said, <hi>He shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in flaming Fire</hi> (when he shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels) <hi>taking Vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> 2 Thes. 1.7, 8. for as Christs inward Appearance is after one manner to his Saints, even most lovely gentle and aimable, but after another manner to the Wicked, even

                  <p>And whereas some say, <hi>They can own no other Body of Christ but that which he giveth his Saints to feed upon, to wit, his Flesh, which is Meat indeed, and his Blood which is Drink indeed; and this is not confined to any one place, but is every where where the Saints are, who feed upon it in all places, whether when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>I Answer</hi>; The Body of Christ is one, even as Christ is one; but that Christ is one, doth not hinder that he hath a two fold Nature, to wit, the one of his Godhead, the other of his Manhood, forever united together in most excellent and admirable Unity; yet the Godhead of Christ is not his Manhood. Again, as concerning the <hi>Manhood of Christ,</hi> we ought, according to Scripture, to distinguish betwixt his <hi>Body,</hi> and <hi>Flesh,</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> as he is, and was the heavenly Man in all Ages of the World, and was before the World was, and who fed the Saints in all Ages, as well before Christ came in the Flesh as since, with his heavenly Flesh and Blood, that is spiritually or mystically so called, as it is also called <hi>Bread, Wine, Milk, Honey, Marrow</hi> &amp; <hi>Fatness,</hi> and which is proper and belonging to him, as he is the Heavenly Man, or Lord from Heaven, before he took Flesh in the Virgins Womb. I say, we ought to distinguish betwixt his Flesh and Nature which he giveth us to partake of and feed upon, and that Flesh and Nature of ours which he did partake of, that is of a far inferiour kind, in it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, yet is now wonderfully exalted and glorified in Heaven with himself.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, as he is and was the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Man, in his heavenly Flesh &amp; Blood before this World was, and is the Food of the Saints, he neither can nor ought to be understood as limitted or confined to any particular place, visible or invisible, but is every where present, giving Being, Life and Virtue to all Creatures, according to their various Capacities. But when we speak of the Body of Christ, as it was born of the Virgin, and appeared among the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, was crucified, dead and buried, and rose and ascended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and is now in Heaven, we ought to consider, that, as when it was upon Earth, though the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in it, yet
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:000691_0102_0FA9A0E158008030"/>
it was not every where present, but was sometimes in one place and sometimes in another; so now that it is in Heaven, it is not every where present, but doth there remain, and will, until the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and though the Fullness of the Godhead dwelleth in it, yet that is not so to be understood, as if the Godhead were confined to that Body, and were no where else but where that Body is; but it hath this sence, That such a Fullness of Gods Presence, and of the divine Grace, Life, Power and Virtue, Light, Wisdom &amp; Knowledge doth dwell in him, as in no other whomsoever, neither Angels nor Saints; and out of that fullness which dwelt, and still dwelleth Bodily in him, all Saints and Angels receive proportionably, and Grace for Grace, as <hi>Iohn</hi> hath declared. And it may and ought to be acknowledged, That the Man Christ Jesus, the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is now glorified in Heaven, in that Nature and Seed which he did take, doth send forth into all his Saints, divine Communications and Influences of Light, Life and Grace, and divine Power and Virtue, to quicken, refresh and comfort them, as also to teach and instruct them still more and more in the Mysteries of his heavenly Kingdom; and by these divine Communications and Participations of Light, Life and Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are united unto him, and he unto them, as the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are unto the Head, and their Prayers and Breathings ascend unto him, which he presenteth unto the Father; and as they feel and are sensible of his divine Power and Virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as really as if he were Bodily present, so he feeleth and is sensible of all their Sufferings, Afflictions, Wants, Necessities, Tryals, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it is by his Grace, Virtue, Light, Life and Power, that all who become Saints, are converted and renewed, so as of <hi>Vnholy</hi> to become <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Holy</hi>; for it was the Man Christ Jesus that said, <hi>And I, when I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And that <hi>Iude</hi> doth take particular notice, that <hi>Enoch</hi> was the seventh from <hi>Adam</hi> (as the Book of <hi>Genesis</hi> declareth) doth plainly point at the seventh Age of the World in which this should come to pass; and as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Sabbath began on the Evening of the sixth Day, before the sixth Day was wholly expired some considerable time, so there is cause to believe, That that great Sabbath shall begin some considerable time before the six thousand Years of the World be expired (<hi>but more of this in the Chronology.</hi>)</p>

seeing Christs glorified Body is not every where at once, nor shall the glorified Bodies of the Saints at the Resurrection be every where at once, it is most equal and rational, according to Scripture, to believe, that they shall appear in some certain place above the Glob of the Earth, over or above the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> where Christ ascended, after he rose from the Dead. And though the Resurrection Body of a Saint cannot be in all places at once, yet without doubt they can move from one place to another at any distance, upwards or downwards, South, North, East or VVest, in the twinckling of an Eye, or according to the swiftness of a Thought, which is easie to understand to such who know, that some of the movable Stars and Luminaries move some hundreds of Miles in less than one Minute of Time, some of which are greater Bodies than the Glob of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>But against Christs outward Appearance in his glorified Body, some object <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Yet a little while and the World seeth me no more.</hi>

                  <p>To which <hi>I Answer</hi>; These words are so far from being any proof against Christs outward Appearance in his glorified Body at the time appointed, that it is a good Proof for it; for he doth not say, after I go away the World seeth me no more, but <hi>yet a little while, &amp;c.</hi> and within that little while he promised, that his Disciples should see him, to wit, spiritually and inwardly present with them, the which <hi>little while</hi> containeth the space of time betwixt his Bodily Ascention into Heaven, and his Return; the which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though in it self considered, is a large time, yet compared with the Ages in the World to come, may well be called <hi>a little Time, A Thousand Years with the Lord being as one Day.</hi> And whereas the <hi>English</hi> Translation hath it, <hi>The World seeth me no more,</hi> the words (<hi>no more</hi>) cannot exclude all time to come, but only some limitted time; for the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, some object, <hi>That if Christ hath such a spiritual Body that shall outwardly appear, it will be so glorious that Men with their outward Eyes cannot behold it; for if men cannot stedfastly behold the Sun with their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Eyes, because of its Glory, how much less the Body of the Man Christ that shall be incomparably more bright and glorious?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this <hi>I Answer</hi>; This Objection hath no weight against the Saints seeing Christs Body, who shall have attained their Resurrection Bodies,

that shall be like unto his; for as <hi>Iohn</hi> hath declared, <hi>We know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. And therefore though the Eye of the poor weak Mortal Body cannot see him as he is, yet that hinders not but the Eyes of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection Body can so see him.</p>
                  <p>And as concerning these of the Saints who shall be living in mortal Bodies at Christs Appearance in his glorified Body, he can show himself well enough unto them, in such a manner and after such a form as they are able to bear, though they cannot see him altogether as he is, or as the Saints raised in Immortal Bodies can do, even as when the Disciples, <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> saw him at his Translation on <hi>Mount Tabor</hi>; for even before his ascention into Heaven, the Lord Jesus appeared unto the Disciples after a divers form. And for the Wicked, though they cannot see him as the Saints, yet they may be made to see him after a sort, to cause great Terror and Astonishment unto them; so that if they cannot see him as the Saints shall, yet they may see some <hi>Sign</hi> of him, as Christ himself said, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.30. <hi>And then shall appear the Sign of the Son of Man in Heaven, and then shall all the Tribes of the Earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the Clouds of Heaven, with Power and great Glory:</hi> Now whether this be referred to an inward or outward sight of Christ, the difficulty is the same, for certainly Wicked men can neither see Christ nor God inwardly with the Eyes of their Souls, as the Saints do; they can only see him in Wrath, to cause in them great dread and horror; and so they may see Christ, even outwardly.</p>

By which it appeareth from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is of great moment to be found in the Faith of the <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead,</hi> and it is a great hurt not to believe it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore People should not make so light a matter of that, and other parts of <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> as some do, thinking, <hi>if they have the Life it is enough</hi>; but the Life of Christ and his Doctrine go along together; &amp; therefore he who hath not the Doctrine of Christ, and abideth not in the same, <hi>hath not God,</hi> and consequently hath not the Life of Christ, 2 <hi>Iohn</hi> 9. for unsound Doctrine maketh an unsound Mind, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Mind is as a leeking Vessel or a broken Cistern, that when the Water of Life is poured into it, holdeth no Water; and therefore any thing or part of unsound Doctrine causeth some decay or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the Life; and a great Error in Doctrine, that respecteth some of the principal Matters of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> is like a great hole in the Vessel, that maketh it exceeding leeky.

                  <p>Now that the Saints are not immediately raised up after Death (so as to attain to the Resurrection of the Body) or after the Spirit goeth out of the Body (although the Souls and Spirits of all righteous and faithful Men &amp; Women, who dye in the Faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, do immediately go unto God and Christ in Heaven, and enter into a very great and large enjoyment of the heavenly blessedness, after the Bodily decease) is clear from many express Testimonies of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for the deceased Saints, (tho' their Souls and Spirits are alive with the Lord in Heaven, and do not sleep, but are awake, and pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

And as concerning that <hi>great Day of Iudgment to come,</hi> Christ doth plainly declare, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.30, 31, &amp; 36. <hi>But of that Day &amp; Hour know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man, no not the Angels in Heaven, but my Father only.</hi> And <hi>Mark</hi> 13.32. <hi>But of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man, no, not the Angels which are in Heaven, neither the Son, but the Father</hi>; which is to be understood of Christ, the Son, as Man to whom then it was not known; the which Day and Hour cannot be the time immediately after mens Decease (for when men dye, the day of their Death is commonly known) for though after Death there is a Judgment that followeth to every one, according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. yet that is not the great and last Judgment, nor universal, but particular. And of this last day Christ said, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.40. <hi>And this is the Will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting Life, and I will raise him up at the last day: Note,</hi> He doth not say, I will raise him up in the Body immediately after Death, but in the last Day, to wit, in the end of the World; and with respect to this <hi>Martha</hi> made a good Confession of her Faith, touching the Resurrection of the dead, saying. <hi>I know that he shall rise again in the Resurrection, at the last day</hi>; the which Christ doth not in the least contradict, but opened a furder Mystery unto her, to wit, <hi>That he was the Resurrection and the Life, he that believeth in me</hi> (said Christ) <hi>though he were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never dye.</hi> And because he was the Resurrection, to wit, the Author of it, <hi>therefore he could and would raise</hi> Lazarus, <hi>her Brother, from the dead at that time</hi>; which yet
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000691_0120_0FA9A0F0735BACB0"/>
was not the Resurrection in the last day; for he was but raised at that time a mortal man, to dye again. And whereas Christ said, <hi>That he who believeth in him, shall never dye,</hi> containeth a great and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Mystery, to wit, that neither the Souls nor Bodies of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers strictly dye; their Souls sleep not, but are awake, and their Bodies, though they sleep, dye not, and their sleep is not the sleep of Death, strictly taken; and therefore Christ proved against the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> the Resurrection of the dead, from the words of God to <hi>Moses, I am the God of</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and God is not the God of the dead, but of the living</hi>; and therefore nothing of these holy men were strictly dead, neither their Souls nor their Bodies; for even their Bodies did but sleep, as when the Body of a Man sleepeth, that is not dead; for the Bodies only of such dye, in the worst sence of the word <hi>Death,</hi> who dye in final Unbelief and Impenitency, <hi>On whom Death feeds, and whose Iniquities are upon their Bones, and whose Bodies are called the Carkases of them that have transgressed against the Lord, whose Worm dyeth not, and their Fire goeth not out; Psal.</hi> 49.14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.27. <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.24. But as concerning the dead Bodies of the Saints and true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Christ Jesus, it is prophecyed, <hi>Isa</hi> 26.19. <hi>Thy dead, my dead Body shall arise</hi> (so the <hi>Hebrew</hi> hath it) <hi>awake and sing, ye that dwell in the Dust, for thy Dew is as the dew of Herbs, and the Earth shall cast out the Dead.</hi> By which words it is plain, that Christ owneth the dead Bodies of his Saints to be his dead Body, as Members of him, their Head; And to this doth <hi>Paul</hi>'s Testimony most evidently agree, and seemeth to point at it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.13, 14, 15. <hi>Meats for the Belly, and the Belly for Meats, but God shall destroy both it and them; now the Body is not for Fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the Body, and God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own Power; Know ye not that your Bodies are the Members of Christ, &amp;c?</hi> Where note these particulars, 1<hi>st.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> distinguisheth betwixt the Belly and the Body, saying, <hi>God will destroy the Belly,</hi> but he doth not say he will destroy the Body; for seeing after the Resurrection of the dead men shall need none of the Meats of this corruptible World, nor shall they need a Belly to put them in, as Guts &amp; Draught, or any gross parts, as men now have. 2<hi>dly.</hi> That he saith, <hi>The Body is for the Lord, and the Lord for the Body</hi>; Now how is that to be understood but thus, That the Body is the Lords, &amp; he hath bought it, together with the Soul, to be his Temple and Habitation; and as while in the

mortal state he dwelt in it, so he will again after Death raise it up, and dwell in it forever. 3<hi>dly.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> proveth that the Lord will raise up the Body of every true Saint and Believer, because God hath raised up Jesus in Body, and therefore he will raise up all you that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jesus. 4<hi>thly.</hi> And that because their Bodies are the Members of Christ, and it is most absurd to think, that any of Christs Members should Perish. 5<hi>thly,</hi> That he enforceth it as a strong Argument and Motive to perswade men, professing Faith in Christ, not to defile their Bodies with Fornication, because they are the Members of Christ, and the Members of Christ are not to be made the Members of an Harlot: Where it is also to be well noticed, That he doth not speak here only of the Soul, but of the Body, and therefore both Soul and Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Christ, and they are his purchase, and therefore he will inherit them forever, for indeed, though the Soul be the most principal part of a Man, yet it is not the whole Man, the Body is also a part of the Man, &amp; Christ doth save, wash &amp; sanctifie <hi>Spirit, Soul &amp; Body of Man,</hi> according to 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.23. <hi>And the very God of Peace sanctifie you w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But here I desire the Reader diligently to mind, that what is said of the Drossy part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to mens Bodies, called by <hi>Paul, Corruption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. is no wise to be understood of the Body of Christ, which had no such part in it, but was altogether most pure, and saw no Corruption; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Sepulchre was looked into, nothing was there to be found, but the Grave Cloathes.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Thou sowest not that Body that shall be, and God giveth a Body as pleaseth him,</hi> yet it is to be observed, that he saith, <hi>God giveth to every Seed his own Body</hi>; for it is granted, the Body is not the same in Condition and Quality, or manner of Being, but wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully changed, as to that; yet the same for substance, the drossy part being excluded. And it is not to be denyed, but as the Seed of Corn that riseth, getteth many additional parts to it of a new Body, whereby it is multiplyed into many Grans, so the Resurrection Body hath also that which is added unto it of that excellent Earth, out of which it ariseth, which is not this visible Earth that we tred upon, but far more excellent, the Dust whereof is Gold, and the Stones of it Saphires, <hi>Iob</hi> 28.6. compar'd with <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.21. And as the Body of Man at first was made of such excellent Dust, in <hi>Hebrew</hi> call'd <hi>Apher</hi> or <hi>Opher,</hi> so it shall be made up again of the same.</p>

to some of their Brethren, that in the Mouth of certain Witnesses every word may be established; and concerning which <hi>Paul</hi> did write to <hi>Timothy, That he had professed a good Profession of the Faith, to which he was called, before many Witnesses,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.12. the <hi>Greek</hi> word signifieth most properly a <hi>verbal Confession</hi>; but where this is wanting to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in a solemn and weighty manner, Multitudes of Ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, altogether ignorant of the first Principles of <hi>Christian Doctrine,</hi> and Unbelievers concerning them, will crowd in among others, and not only presume to be Church Members, but also to be Elders and Teachers in the Church, to the great scandal and offence of many, as hath come to pass in too many, to my certain knowledge. And as in the primitive Church, not only the Church Members were tryed, but the Church Officers also, even the very Deacons, and it was required in Teachers, <hi>That they might be apt or able to Teach,</hi> as well as orderly in Conversation, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10. for seeing the Church in Scripture is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a <hi>House built of Stones, polished and squared, after the similitude of a Palace, in the Wall of which no Stone is to be laid, but the measuring Line and Reed is to be applyed unto it</hi>; even so ought all the Members of the Church to be duely measured, and tryed, and proved with the Line and Rod of Truth. And though this is the work of God principally, yet it is the Work of the Saints and true Believers, working together instrumentally with God, and therefore the Church of <hi>Pergamos</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved because <hi>she had them that did hold the Doctrine of</hi> Balaam, <hi>and of the</hi> Nicolaitans; and the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> is commended, <hi>That she could not bear them which are evil, and had tryed them which say, they are Apostles, and are not.</hi> Beside, what did it signifie, that in the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> there were Porters, and Keepers of the Doors of the Temple, but that in the Gospel Church there should be such who should be as Porters or Door-keepers, strictly to note and observe that none come into the Church, but such who come in duely qualified, and at the right door, which is Christ; and whoever come in by him, they not only believe him and his Doctrine, in the most principal and necessary things, but also profess the same? But the Profession and Declaration of Church Members, to what they believe, must not be, but of the most necessary and principal things or heads of Christian Doctrine, delivered in plain Scripture words, or such as are equivolent, plain and easie to be understood; and in some things of less Moment, an allowance is to be given, and Charity to be exercised towards them

Preaching, and Praying, and Praising God, and serving and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him is to be in Spirit and in Truth, but far another thing indeed to preach in the Spirit, to pray and sing and give Thanks in the Spirit, and to do these things purely, &amp; without all mixture: And alas! how oft do too many pretend to offer the right Fire on Gods Altar, and profess in words a great holy Zeal, but upon due search it is found to be but strange Fire, and Sparks of mans kindling, too oft the heat and wrath of mans Spirit doth pass for a divine fervour; all which showeth, that the Church is not as yet arrived to that perfect Restoration in Purity and good Order as is to be expected.

And none ought to make a Seperation from his <hi>Christian Brethren,</hi> whom he seeth to be the purest Society on Earth known to him, though perhaps he seeth that they are not altogether pure in all respects, untill he find that they are willfull, and settling down where they are, and refusing to travel onwards to greater degrees of Purity; nor even then is he to be hasty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to wait to know the Lord to direct &amp; guide him in what he doth.

Power of God unto Salvation, but he blesseth them with some consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Success; for <hi>Ieremiah</hi> giveth it as a Mark of false Prophets, that they turned not the People from the evil of their ways, which they should have done, if they had hearkened to Gods Voice, and stood in his Counsel. But many Peachers are more ready to blame the People, and lay the default upon their Hearers, that they are not converted, than upon themselves; but surely it doth greatly concern all who pretend to be Preachers and Ministers of Christ, whether the blame doth not in great part lie upon themselves, yea or nay; as whether their Ministry be not barren, and the words they speak dead and dry? also, whether their Walking and Conversation, not being such as becometh the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ, be not a great Offence and stumbling Block to many? for it cannot be denyed, but even at this day there is a great deal of Preaching &amp; Praying used in Assemblies, by divers, &amp; yet very few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, though divers convinced, &amp; few grow much either in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Virtue of the Truth, under the frequent Ministry of divers, who pretend highly to the Spirits Teachings; and though the Ministry of many hath had great and blessed Success in our day, to turn many to Righteousness, which is a proof their Ministry is of God, yet the best Ministry that now is in being, so far as we know, hath reached little further than to two or three Nations, and but to a few in them, in comparison of others, who remain in darkness; but as the Purity, and more pure and perfect Restoration of the Church doth advance, the Word and Doctrine of the Gospel will advance, and have its free Course, until it be preached to all the Nations of the Earth, which, will be fullfilled before the end of the World, as Christ hath plainly fore-told.</p>
                  <p>And as God hath promised to his Church &amp; People great Knowledge (and that he will teach them himself, from the least of them to the greatest, as well as give them able Ministers) &amp; Holiness (see <hi>Isa.</hi> 62.12.) so he hath promised to give them great Peace, both among themselves, and also as to others, as <hi>Isa.</hi>

And that which shall greatly encrease the Dignity and Felicity of the Church of the Saints living in mortal Bodies within the Thousand Years, is, that they shall converse frequently with the Lord Jesus Christ and the raised Saints, who have put off the mortal Cloathing, and put on the immortal, and have familiar Conversation with them, as the Apostles had with Christ after his Resurrection, and

But the Glory of the Church of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> of the Saints living in mortal Bodies upon Earth, who shall be born of Women, and begot of Men in the way of lawful Marriage, and who shall eat and drink the Fruits of the Earth, with all becoming Moderation, &amp; holy Reverence, and Thanks-giving, is such, that no words or declaration is sufficient to express it, only some hints are given of it, so far as the Scriptures hold forth, according to the small measure of that divine Illumination I have received. And tho' the chief Government over all the Earth and Mankind, that shall live therein within the Thousand Years, shall belong to Christ and the raised Saints (who shall frequently outwardly appear to Men, both good and bad, or disappear, as they shall see meet, and as Christ used to do after his Resurrection; for he appeared or disappeared, as he pleased) yet in a secondary &amp; subordinate way and manner, the Saints living in mortal Bodies shall also reign with Christ and the raised Saints, over all Nations of the Earth, and they shall have the full dispose and command of all the Riches and Treasures of the Earth, which they shall use with all holy and godly Moderation and Discretion, to the Glory of God and the mutual Comfort of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for then shall that be fullfilled which is written in <hi>Isa.</hi> 23.18. concerning the Riches of <hi>Tyre,</hi> after the return of her Captivity, <hi>and her Merchandize and her Hire shall be Holiness to the Lord; it shall not be treasured nor laid up, for her Merchandize shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, &amp; for durable Cloathing</hi>; but the raised Saints, that have put off the mortal Cloathing shall neither need nor use any of these things, <hi>neither shall they Marry and give in Marriage, but be as the Angels of God,</hi> as Christ hath taught, when he proved the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Dead against the Sadduces, and I wish such as hold the

and <hi>Abiram</hi> rebelled against <hi>Moses</hi> the Servant of God, that they dyed not the common Death of men, but the Earth swallowed them up alive; and when <hi>Miriam</hi> spoke against <hi>Moses,</hi> she was struck with a Leprosie, which was not heal'd until <hi>Moses</hi> pray'd for her unto the Lord, <hi>Num.</hi> 12. And the Sentence of Excommunication that was then in the Church, &amp; which not only the Apostles, but others had Power to pass against such as deserved it, was a thing that was done by a divine Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that had some manifest Effects upon the Persons, against whom it was inflicted, that made it so very dreadful; and therefore it is said, (after that which came to pass in the matter of <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira) Great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard these things, Acts</hi> 5.11. And <hi>vers.</hi> 13. it is said, <hi>And of the rest durst no man joyn himself to them, but the People magnified them.</hi> And therefore it may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably be expected, that when due Gospel Discipline shall be duely exercised in the Power and Authority of God, in the Church, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God will be manifest both inwardly and outwardly, in such manner as will make the Hypocrites afraid to present themselves as Members of the Church of Christ; and this will be as a Fan in the hand of the Lord Jesus Christ, to sweep his floor, and to seperate the Wheat from the Chaff: And truely the time draweth near that the hour of Gods Judgments will come yet more manifestly, and then great will be the Wo that shall be due to such as make a great and large Profession of the Truth, and yet are not in it; for of a certain, a <hi>fanning, searching, sifting and winnowing Time is very near at hand,</hi> and the Spirit of Christ is grieved with the liberty and looseness that too many take, who even profess the Teachings and Leadings of the Spirit, &amp; Judgment is like to begin at such; and most assuredly God is calling for a further degree of Purity and Reformation, than any have yet attained unto, and will in due time effect it, and that not only by his own immediate Power, but by raising up Instruments to work with him; for great things God hath done, and yet will do, by Instruments of his fitting and preparing, in the Earth. Therefore it is high time for us to be waiting for the Coming of the Lord to be revealed in greater Power and Authority, to cleanse his House and Garden, that none may refuse to joyn with him, when he calleth, or oppose or slight any Instruments of his raising for such a work, however mean and despisable they may seem to be in the Eyes of Men. And surely it is matter of grief to find some sitting down at ease where they are, and thinking all is well enough already; and

But devout and religious <hi>Gentiles</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> who have not the Faith of Christ crucified, they have not that Influence of the holy Spirit that true Believers in Christ crucified and raised again have, but an Influence of a far inferiour sort and degree; for though the Spirit of God is <hi>One</hi> in being, yet it is said in Scripture to be <hi>seven fold,</hi> and also <hi>two fold,</hi> to wit, the Spirit of Bondage, to such who are but Servants in the House of God, and the Spirit of Adoption to such who are Sons, through Faith in Christ Jesus; and this two fold kind of divine Influence is that which by way of Analogy doth answer to the Waters below and above the Firmament, these below the Firmament answering to the divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences given to them who are under the Law, &amp; these Waters above the Firmament answer to the divine Influences of the Spirit given to true <hi>Christians</hi> and Believers in Christ crucified, under the Gospel; for God hath so honoured his Son, and glorified him, that because he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himself to the Death of the Cross, for the sins of Men, therefore he hath ordained it, that this more excellent Influence and Grace of the holy Ghost should accompany the Doctrine and Preaching of <hi>Christ crucified and raised again,</hi> and the Faith of him, as such. Hence it is that the Gospel of Christ is called, <hi>The Gospel of our Salvation,</hi> and the <hi>Power of God unto Salvation,</hi> and Christ crucified, <hi>The Wisdom &amp; Power of God.</hi> And it is very evident from the Writings of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That these only were called <hi>Christians,</hi> who were Believers in the crucified Jesus, and that he rose again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and became Followers of his Virtues and holy Life, and by so doing hoped to receive Eternal Life, and the Resurrection of the Dead by him.
