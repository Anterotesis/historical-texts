            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is with Pleaſure I ſee, at this time, a Grand-Jury that I am convinced do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much to be ſaid to them, to inſtruct them in their Duty, or the Occaſion of their being called here: However, Cuſtom makes it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that ſomething ſhould be ſaid to you from the Bench: I hope therefore you will give me your Patience, if, inſtead of confining myſelf to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that relate more immediately to your Office as a Grand Jury, I take up ſome Part of your Time in treating of a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of more general Uſe, and of the greateſt Importance to the Publick Safety; the LAWFULNESS OF DEFENCE againſt an armed Enemy.</p>
            <p>IT may, perhaps, at firſt View, ſeem ſtrange that there ſhould be any Occaſion to prove a Thing in its own Nature ſo evident: But whoever reflects, that this very Point has taken up a conſiderable Part of the publick Debates in a neighbouring Government; to which we are nearly related, and what a Number of Abettors the Aſſertors of the Unlawfulneſs of all kind of Defence have ſound, will be leſs ſurprized at it. For my own Part, I look upon this Doctrine not only to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Warrant or Colour, either from Reaſon or Revelation; but in its Conſequences pernicious to Society, and intirely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with, and deſtructive of all civil Government. But as Opinions, otherwiſe than as they are ſupported by Reaſon, ought to be but of little Authority; I will endeavour to diſcuſs this Point fairly, and to ſet the Matter in a true Light. <hi>Firſt,</hi> By ſhewing how the Caſe ſtood under the Law of Nature.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004708_0003_100DC0C150F97D50"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That no Religion whatſoever, founded upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſupernatural Revelation of the Will of GOD, can be true, that is inconſiſtent with or repugnant to the Law of Nature: And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I propoſe to examine ſome of the principal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities from Holy Writ, which the Patrons and Aſſertors of the Unlawfulneſs of Defence, under the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, have adduced to prove their Point; and to ſhew that theſe Authorities are ſo far from ſupporting their Doctrine, that they are either quite foreign to the Caſe, or that they militate directly againſt the Adducers of them.</p>
            <p>SOME Men of great Learning and Knowledge have amuſed themſelves and the World, with endeavouring to diſcover what great End the Supream Being propoſed to himſelf in the Creation of the World, and of Mankind in particular; and have formed various Conjectures about it. Certain, however, it is, that an Addition to His own Happineſs could not be the Motive; becauſe He muſt neceſſarily have been infinitely happy from all Eternity. And it is no leſs certain, that ſuch a Being, as we all underſtand GOD to be, a Being of infinite Goodneſs and Benevolence, could not poſſibly intend the Miſery and Unhappineſs of a Number of rational Creatures, by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be brought into Exiſtence out of nothing: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, no other End than the Happineſs of Mankind in their Creation, can conſiſt with the natural Notions we entertain of GOD. If then it be admitted, that GOD created them with a View to their own Happineſs, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that he afforded them the Means of acquiring ſuch a Degree of it as he intended them, and as was ſuitable to their Circumſtances in the World wherein he had placed them. Accordingly, we find the great Author of our Being has ſo faſhioned and contrived us, that a Deſire of Happineſs, which is of ſo much Importance to us and the End of our Creation, is made the very firſt Principle, or Law of our Natures. And it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that in a State of Nature the firſt Things upon which Men caſt their Thoughts, were the procuring Food to ſatisfy the Cravings of Appetite, Raiment and Houſes to ſhelter them from the Injury and Inclemency of the Seaſons, with ſuch other Conveniences of Life as concerned their immediate Preſervation and Comfort. But, alas! Experience muſt very ſoon have taught them, that theſe Things were vaſtly inſufficient for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Happineſs; and that, were they to ſtop there, they would fall infinitely ſhort of the End. Life and Liberty, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Gifts of GOD, were common to all Men; and every Man had a natural Title to an uncontrouled Enjoyment of them, and, conſequently, a Right to preſerve and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>end them
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004708_0004_100DC0C2D6BDBF30"/>
from the Injuries and Attempts of others, as they concern'd his Happineſs: And what is called Eſtate, or Property, was as abſolutely eſſential to humane Happineſs as even Life or Liberty; and therefore ſome Means of ſecuring and preſerving Life and Liberty, and what every Individual had purchaſed and made his own, by his Labour and Sweat of his Brows, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly neceſſary. If, indeed, all Men, from the Beginning, had acted up to the genuine Law of Nature, and had done what was perfectly right, all other Proviſions or Laws would have been uſeleſs. But inſtead of this, in the Order of Time, a Spirit of Rapaciouſneſs and Corruption appeared in the World; and ſome, by a fatal Miſtake, endeavoured to find their own private Advantages and Happineſs, by making a Prey of the Lives, Liberties and Properties of others, by Violence and a ſtrong Hand. And it is more than probable, that Men in a State of Nature, before they had incorporated themſelves into political Societies, muſt have ſuffered much, as the more Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Weak were expoſed to the Inſults and Invaſions of the more rapacious and ſtrong; and more eſpecially, as it was no eaſy Matter for intereſted Perſons, deſtitute of any other Rule than Moral Rectitude for the Determining Right and Wrong, to decide Diſputes about Property and Juriſdiction. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Deſire then of Happineſs, and that Principle of Self-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, common to all Men, muſt firſt have inſpired them, for their common Protection and Safety, with Notions of Compacts, of Laws, and of Government, as abſolutely neceſſary, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it was impoſſible for them to be happy in any Degree.</p>
            <p>NOW the Difference between Men in a State of Nature, and their being incorporated into political Societies, conſiſts in this: That in a State of Nature there being no common Judge to whom Men could appeal, every Man had a Right to judge of and to puniſh Offences committed againſt him, according as the Heinouſneſs of the Facts, in his Opinion, deſerv'd: But in the other Caſe, having given up that natural Right of private Judgment into the Hands of the Community, he reſorts to the Community, when he thinks he is injured, as to a common Judge or Umpire, and ſubmits his Cauſe to be determined by the eſtabliſhed Rules of the Society for deciding Controverſies between the Members of it, indifferently. But Societies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with regard to one another, having no common Judge between them to whom they can appeal, may be properly ſaid to be in a State of Nature, and to retain that Right of private Judgment, that every ſingle Man naturally had, to repel and puniſh Injuries committed againſt them. And it would be exceedingly ridiculous to ſuppoſe, that a Number of Men,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004708_0005_100DC0C50ADFE3C8"/>
formed and united into a political Society for their common Safety and Happineſs, ſhould thereby loſe any Part of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right, of preſerving and defending themſelves from a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemy, that every Individual had before ſuch Union.</p>
            <p>IF then Men muſt have been miſerable without the Aid of Government and civil Society; the Preſervation and Defence of that Government or Society muſt neceſſarily have been right by the Law of Nature, and conſequently agreeable to the Will of GOD, who was the Author of that Law, and had given Men no other general Rule. Let us then conſider in what Manner any political Society can poſſibly be affected, ſo as to make any kind of Defence neceſſary for its Preſervation. And it cannot poſſibly happen but one of theſe two Ways, <hi>to wit,</hi> either from ſome of the Members of the Society con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring againſt it, and acting contrary to the Laws and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Conſtitution of it; or from ſome foreign Enemy, by Force of Arms. It will be rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>gour of the Laws they violate, becauſe they themſelves are Parties to thoſe Laws, and bound to the Obſervance of them by their own Compacts. But what is to be done in caſe of a foreign Enemy, ſeeing here is no Compact? I know of no Alternative, but the Relying upon Prayers and Tears, or reſiſting by Force. And if the Aid of Prayers and Tears may be relied on in ſuch Caſes, they may be depended on againſt Rebels and Traitors, and in all other Caſes, and conſequently all Government is uſeleſs. But the Uſefulneſs and Neceſſity of Government has been already ſhewn, as alſo the Right of preſerving it: And if Force is at all neceſſary or lawful, no Medium can poſſibly be aſſigned between the leaſt and the greateſt Degree of it; and there is no Way to reſiſt an Army but by an Army, nor to repel Force but by Force. I believe it will hardly be inſiſted on, that an Indictment againſt the General and Principal Officers of an invading Army, would be any Security at all; and any Attempt of that Sort would ſerve only to be laugh'd at, and to be a ſtanding Jeſt amongſt the Reſt of Mankind. If then Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is eſſential to human Happineſs, as has been ſeen; if the Preſervation of Government is equally eſſential; and if Force is neceſſary to the Preſervation of Government; it very clearly follows, that War was lawful by the Law of Nature; becauſe if it were otherwiſe, Men would be denied the Liberty of uſing the Means neceſſary to that Happineſs which GOD deſigned them, and which was the End of their Creation; which would be abſurd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004708_0006_100DC0C86FF52920"/>AS I have mentioned the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> to you, and have propoſed to ſhew, that no Religion, founded upon any pretended ſupernatural Revelation of GOD's Will, can be true, that is repugnant to the Law of Nature; it will be proper to explain to you what I mean by it. By the Law of Nature then, is meant the Law of Reaſon, or in other Words, it is ſuch a Rule for the Doing what is fit and proper for rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to do as they are capable of diſcovering by the right Uſe of their natural Faculties, unaſſiſted by ſupernatural Revelation. This Law of Reaſon is the general Law of our Natures, and claims GOD for its Author; and therefore may, with the greateſt Truth and Propriety, be called the Law of GOD Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And as GOD is infinitely wiſe and good, it would be down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Blaſphemy to ſay, or to ſuppoſe, that he would give Men a Rule for their Conduct that was not adequate to the End for which he gave it; or that a Conformity of human Actions to this general Law of GOD, would not juſtify Men in his Sight; and much more to ſay, it would diſpleaſe him. Whatſoever therefore was right, whatſoever was fit, whatſoever was lawful for Men to do, in order to procure Happineſs, under the Law of Nature, muſt have been eternally ſo, as being founded in the very Nature and Reaſon of Things: And whatſoever is right, fit and lawful from the Nature and Reaſon of Things, muſt neceſſarily continue to be right, fit and lawful to all Eternity. GOD is the ſame to Day, Yeſterday and forever: In him is no Change or Variableneſs at all; but his Ways are conſtant and uniform. Hence it moſt evidently follows, that any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or any Part of a Religion, that is pretended to be built upon a ſupernatural Diſcovery of GOD's Will, cannot poſſibly be true, that is inconſiſtent with, or repugnant to the primary Law of GOD, or Law of Nature, which is the ſame Thing; becauſe it would imply Imperfection, Change and Variableneſs in GOD, which are contrary to his very Nature. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; the Practice of Morality is of eternal Obligation; and Part of the Law of Nature, and is ſo abſolutely eſſential to Man's Happineſs, that without it he cannot poſſibly be happy in any Degree: Juſtice, Benevolence and Gratitude are moral Virtues: Now, ſuppoſe it poſſible that any Perſon having a Power, or appearing to have Power, to work the moſt ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Miracles, ſhould pretend an Authority from GOD to teach Mankind, that the Exerciſe of Juſtice, Benevolence and Gratitude was wrong and diſpleaſing to GOD; would ſuch a Perſon deſerve any Credit? And would not all wiſe and good Men conclude him to be either a Devil or an Impoſtor? Surely the would! And the Reaſon is plain, becauſe ſuch Doctrine is diametrically oppoſite to right Reaſon, and contrary to our
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004708_0007_100DC0C9F61CC880"/>
natural Notions of GOD. Now as Government and political Society have been clearly ſhewn, from the very Nature and Reaſon of Things, to be eſſentially neceſſary to human Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that the Preſervation of Society is no leſs eſſential; and that Force is requiſite to that Preſervation; If any Man, or even an Angel from Heaven, ſhould pretend an Authority from GOD to pronounce all kind of Defence to be unlawful, he ought to be rejected as a Liar and an Impoſtor. Thoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that pretend to make out from the Bible, that War, in every Shape, is forbidden under the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, will infallibly prove the Bible itſelf to be wrong, or themſelves to be very wrong Interpreters of it.</p>
            <p>LET none, from this Manner of ſpeaking, imagine that I intend to inſinuate any thing to the Prejudice or Diſcredit of the ſacred Writings, or to caſt any Imputations upon the Bible: Far, very far, be that from my Thoughts. On the contrary, though I do inſiſt that the Bible would be no Warrant, nor ought to be of any Authority to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a Doctrine inconſiſtent with human Happineſs, by prohibiting the neceſſary Means leading to it; yet, I do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aſſert, that it cannot juſtly be impeached with any thing of this Nature. And I hope I ſhall be able clearly to make out, to your Satisfaction, that there is not the leaſt Colour of Authority from the Scriptures, to prove that a juſt and neceſſary War is forbidden to Chriſtians; but that thoſe Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that are commonly made uſe of by thoſe who deny the Lawfulneſs of Self-Defence to Chriſtians, are either miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood or groſly perverted by them. It would detain you too long, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> were I to examine and conſider all the Parts of Scripture that have been frequently cited upon this Occaſion. I ſhall therefore ſelect ſome of the principal Texts that I find quoted by an Author of very great Note <note n="*" place="bottom">Barclay.</note> and ſome others on the ſame Side of the Queſtion, and endeavour to ſhew that they carry no ſuch Interpretation as theſe People pretend.</p>
            <p>THOSE Parts of Scripture that are alledged as Authorities in this Caſe, are ſaid to be either Propheſies, importing an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Ceſſation of War under the Goſpel; poſitive Precepts, forbidding the Uſe of the Sword to Chriſtians; or general Precepts, that prove War to be incompatible with Chriſtianity, and oppoſite to the Temper and Spirit of the Goſpel. To the firſt of theſe, the famous Propheſies in the Books of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Micah</hi> are conſtantly cited, and great Streſs has been laid thereon. In order therefore to the clear Underſtanding this Propheſy, I
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004708_0008_100DC0CB8126CCC0"/>
will trouble you with the Paſſage at large, which runs thus: <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt Days, that the Mountain of the Lord's Houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the Top of the Mountains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhall be exalted above the Hills; And all Nations ſhall flow unto it. And many People ſhall go and ſay, Come ye and let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the Houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will teach us of his Way, and we will walk in his Paths; for out of</hi> Zion <hi>ſhall go forth the Law; and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>And he ſhall judge among the Nations and ſhall rebuke many People: And they ſhall beat their Swords into Plow-ſhares, and their Spears into Pruning-Hooks; Nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt Nation, neither ſhall they learn War any more. Oh Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>come ye and let us walk in the Light of the Lord.</hi> Happy, happy, oh happy indeed will the World be in the bleſſed Accompliſhment of this Propheſy! The true and genuine Conſtruction of this Paſſage appears ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly to be, That in the latter Ages of the World, or in the Fulneſs of the Goſpel-Times, all Nations ſhall ſo univerſally adhere to the Law of GOD, that Righteouſneſs ſhall be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the Earth; every Man ſhall do what is right and juſt; none ſhall injure or violate the Right of his Brother, his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or his Friend; and in Conſequence of this, War will naturally ceaſe and be aboliſhed, as the Effect will naturally vaniſh when the Cauſe is taken away; Swords, Spears, and other warlike Implements will become uſeleſs Lumber, or in the Language of the Prophet, may be converted into Plow-Shares, and other Implements of Huſbandry. Now as no Man can pretend that the Propheſy in this Senſe is yet accompliſhed, but that theſe happy Days, this glorious Reformation is yet to be expected in GOD's due time, it is certainly a moſt unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Concluſion, to infer, that War, which was lawful in order to repel lawleſs Force, ſhall become unlawful before lawleſs Force is eradicated and extinguiſhed from amongſt Men. Let us, for Illuſtration of this Matter, ſuppoſe the Prophets to have ſaid, That in the Fulneſs of the Goſpel-Times the Earth ſhall ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly pour forth her Increaſe; Corn, Wine and Oil ſhall flow without the Hand of the Labourer; Plow-ſhares and Pruning-hooks ſhall then become uſeleſs; Labour and Toil, the ſad Effects of the Fall of Man, ſhall utterly ceaſe and be no more. Would not that Man, who in the Expectation of the Accompliſhment of ſuch a Propheſy, ſhould neglect to cultivate and ſow his Field, or to prune his Vineyard, before the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Time, be in Danger of Starving? And might he not juſtly be reputed mad by the reſt of Mankind? And yet upon no better Foundation do they build, who affirm the Unlawfulneſs of War, upon the Authority of the before-cited Propheſy.</p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004708_0009_100DC0CD8E1623E0"/>THE noted Writer before-mentioned urges againſt the Lawfulneſs of War, <q>That CHRIST ſaid his Kingdom is not of this World, and therefore that his Servants ſhall not fight:</q> Prepoſterouſly inferring, that becauſe CHRIST would not permit his Diſciples to fight in a Caſe wherein Fighting would have been quite improper, that therefore thoſe that fight in any Caſe are not the Diſciples or Servants of CHRIST. I have wonder'd to find the Place here alluded to, ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly tortured and perverted by this Author, and others, contrary to the expreſs Senſe and Meaning of it! Our Saviour being queſtioned by <hi>Pilate</hi> concerning his being King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of the Offence he had been guilty of towards the <hi>Jews,</hi> by whom he ſtood accuſed, and who had delivered him unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> anſwered, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World: If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight that I ſhould not be delivered to the</hi> Jews: <hi>But now is my Kingdom not from hence.</hi> The Deſign of this Decalaration ſeems to be in order to undeceive the <hi>Jews,</hi> who entertained groſs and partial Conceptions about the End of CHRIST's Coming; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it was to eſtabliſh an outward Kingdom at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to reſtore the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But this was not the Caſe. He came to erect a ſpiritual Kingdom to be ſet up in the Hearts of Men, there to bear Rule and Government, to reform a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt World, and reſtore Men to their primitive Natures. Here Reaſon, Perſuaſion, and ſuch Things as tend to convict the Judgment and inlighten the Underſtanding, were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means, were the only ones uſed by him. Force would have been abſolutely improper, and therefore is diſclaimed by him. But he is ſo far from condemning Force, in all Caſes, that he expreſly tells <hi>Pilate,</hi> that were his Kingdom of this World, then ſhould his Servants fight in Defence of his Perſon. As if he had ſaid, Were my Kingdom a temporal Kingdom, to the Preſervation of which Fighting is not only lawful but neceſſary, my Servants would then have done their Duty, and have fought for me, as the Servants of other temporal Princes do in the like Caſes.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Weapons of our Warfare are not carnal but ſpiritual:</hi> But ſays our celebrated Writer,
<q>The Weapons of outward Warfare are carnal, ſuch as Cannon, Muſkets, Spears, Swords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which there is no mention in the Armour deſcribed by <hi>Paul,</hi>
               </q>
and thence infers that War is noways lawful to ſuch as will be the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of CHRIST. A hopeful Inference truely! Here was a Queſtion about a Matter of Fact; whether the Weapons made uſe of in the Propagation of CHRIST's Kingdom were carnal
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004708_0010_100DC0D1A840BFA0"/>
or ſpiritual: The Apoſtle, who figuratively was a Soldier in CHRIST's Cauſe, decides the Queſtion, and declares <hi>the Weapons were ſpiritual and not carnal</hi>; Ergo, quoth our Author, the Uſe of carnal Weapons are unlawful to Chriſtians. Is this a fair Concluſion? It is, no doubt, unlawful to propagate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the Sword; but, ſurely, that does not render the Uſe of the Sword unlawful in all Caſes. It is ſomewhere ſaid, the ſame Apoſtle was a Tent-maker, and if it had been added, that he was not a Shoemaker; the Concluſion that therefore Shoemaking was unlawful, would be equally juſt, as to infer, that becauſe carnal Weapons were not uſed by Chriſtian Prieſts in a Caſe wherein they could have been of no Service, that therefore it is unlawful to uſe them in any Caſe.</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> teſtifies, <hi>That Wars and Strifes come from the Luſts which war in the Members of carnal Men:</hi> But, ſays our Author, <q>true Chriſtians have crucified the Fleſh with its Affections and Luſts:</q> Therefore War is unlawful. How does this Concluſion follow from the Premiſes? Every kind of Wickedneſs proceeds from the ſame Cauſe here aſſigned by the Apoſtle for Wars and Strifes: Does it therefore follow that no Sort of Wickedneſs is to be reſiſted or puniſhed? If ſo, we may ſhake Hands with all Government: Treaſons, Murders, Rapes, and every other Crime, ſhall go unpuniſhed, ſeeing they all come from the Luſts that war in the Members of carnal Men. It is not denied but War is a very bad Thing, and brings dreadful Conſequences along with it. The ſame may be ſaid of Law-Suits. But does it therefore follow that an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Invaſion of our Country, by foreign Enemies, is not to be oppoſed or reſiſted; or that we are not to conteſt an unjuſt Claim ſet up againſt our Eſtates. In either Caſe, one Side muſt be wrong; and it is the Agreſſor, the Wrong-Doer, that is chargeable with the Conſequences, and not thoſe who inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and rightfully defend their Lives or their Properties. And I ſhould be glad to learn from ſuch as infer the Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of War from this Text, how any other Strife comes to be lawful; and in particular, how they will juſtify going to Law upon any Pretence whatſoever; for ſurely it will not be contended, that going to Law is not Strife.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That we fight not with Fleſh and Blood:</hi> But, ſays our Author, <q>outward War is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Fleſh, and againſt Fleſh and Blood: Therefore War is noways lawful to Chriſtians.</q> But how fairly is this Conſequence drawn? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was a Chriſtian Prieſt, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſpread and propagate the Goſpel; Preaching was his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004708_0011_100ECBB176518098"/>
Profeſſion, not War. This being the real Fact, the Apoſtle mentions it as ſuch. And if he had ſaid, <hi>we diſpute not about Men's Properties or Eſtates,</hi> which was likewiſe true, he would thereby as much have condemn'd the Profeſſion of the Law, as he does, in this Place, the Unlawfulneſs of War.</p>
            <p>BUT, it is ſaid, we are commanded not to reſiſt Evil, <hi>but whoſoever ſhall ſmite thee on the one Cheek, to turn the other: And if any Man ſue thee at the Law, and take away thy Coat, give him thy Cloak alſo,</hi> &amp;c. Now theſe Words are either to be taken in a reſtrained and qualified Senſe, or in a literal and unqualified Senſe. Let the Advocates for the Unlawfulneſs of War, upon this Authority, take them either way, and they will find themſelves hooked into a Dilemma. If the Words be taken in a qualified Senſe, they will not prove the Point contended for: And taken the other Way, they will prove too much; for not only War becomes unlawful, but going to Law in Defence of Property, and all Puniſhment of Criminals, will be likewiſe unlawful, which is contrary to their avowed Principles and Practices. For it can never be pretended, that the Hanging a Thief or a Murderer is not reſiſting of Evil; or, that he that proſecutes another at the Law, for an unjuſt Violence committed againſt his Perſon or Eſtate, conforms to the literal Senſe of the Text. The Truth is, that the Words cited, with all that follow to the End of the Chapter, were ſpoken by CHRIST to his Diſciples only, and ſeem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as Rules to them, for their Conduct and Behaviour, in the Diſcharge of their Miniſtry, in order to convert Men to Chriſtianity. But if we admit that they were intended as Leſſons to Chriſtians in general, they can import no more than that it is not lawful to revenge Injuries, and that, in many Caſes, it is better patiently to bear ſome Injuries than to ſeek Redreſs and Satisfaction by returning them.</p>
            <p>WHEN I conſider the Abilities of the Author ſo often quoted, and how great a Maſter of Reaſon he appears to be when he has Reaſon on his Side; and compare therewith his Manner of Defending the Poſition, <q>That War is unlawful to Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q> I confeſs, I am tempted to call his Sincerity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n Queſtion. His Inferences and Concluſions are certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy his great Parts. And his conſtantly Coupling Revenge and War together, as if they were convertible Terms, ſeems to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e a Piece of Craft, calculated to deceive and miſlead the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary. No Chriſtian, I believe, ever doubted that Revenge was unlawful to Chriſtians: but how will it be made out that there can be no War without Revenge? As well may it be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004708_0012_100ECBAE2F439FE8"/>
ſaid, that putting a Malefactor to Death is Revenge, as that Killing Men, in Defence of our Lives, is ſo. Nay, it looks more like Revenge to put a Man to Death in cool Blood, after the Fact, than to kill him in the Attempt, in order to prevent him.
<q>CHRIST, ſaith our Author, the Prince of Peace, hath expreſsly prohibited his Children all Violence.</q>
Could this Man be ignorant that the Violence here prohibited is an unjuſt and forceible Attack upon the Rights of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and not the Reſiſting of ſuch unjuſt Force? I ſhould be glad to know how Hanging a Murderer or Thief can be done without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? And if Violence is la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ful after the Fact is committed, I ſhould gladly be informed, by ſome diſtinguiſhing Head, how Violence comes to be unlawful (when all other Means fail) in order to prevent the Miſchief.</p>
            <p>DOING Good for Evil, Loving our Enemies, and Praying for thoſe that perſecute and calumniate us, are, no doubt, Chriſtian Duties: So are Cloathing the Naked and Feeding the Hungry. But, as we are not required to cloath the Naked and feed the Hungry, and want ourſelves; ſo neither are we obliged to ſtrengthen the Hands of an Enemy againſt ourſelves; nor to pray for his Succeſs, when he aims Deſtruction at our Heads; nor to love him as if he was our Friend. We ought, indeed, to exerciſe Kindneſs and Humanity towards our Enemies, when we have them in our Power, and may do it with Security to ourſelves; try to win and reclaim them, by Gentleneſs, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance and Charity, and to pray that GOD may turn their Hearts; which is all that theſe Precepts require.</p>
            <p>I proved to you in the Beginning, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that no ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Revelation of GOD's Will, can poſſibly be contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or repugnant to Reaſon, which is the natural Revelation of his Will. I laid it down, as a Ground-Work, that GOD intended our Happineſs in our Creation. I have ſhewn that Government and Political Society are abſolutely eſſential to human Happineſs; that the Preſervation of Government is equally eſſential; that Force is neceſſary to that Preſervation, and conſequently, that War was allowable under the Law of Nature. And, I think, it is ſo apparent, from what has been ſaid, that the Scripture cannot be juſtly impeached with Altering the Law of Nature in this Point; or of having taken away Man's natural Right to ſeek that Happineſs which GOD origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deſign'd him, by forbidding Chriſtians to defend their Lives and Properties when they are unjuſtly invaded; that no intelligent Man, who examines it with an impartial, unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Mind, can have the leaſt Doubt about it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:004708_0013_100DC0D729725DE8"/>IF the Right to uſe Force is not connected with and inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from Government, and included in the very Idea of it, I ſhould be glad to know, how the lawful Commands or Mandates of the civil Magiſtrate can poſſibly be executed in Caſe of Diſobedience? We ſee that theſe very People who aſſert the Unlawfulneſs of all Manner of Defence, willingly ſerve in the Legiſlature, conſent to the Enacting Sanguinary and other Penal Laws, act as Sheriffs, ſerve upon Juries, ſit in Courts of Judicature, and there try and condemn Men to Death. Is it not Amazing, that any Men ſhould take it into their Heads that it is lawful for one Chriſtian forceibly to put another to Death, after his Hands are tied behind him, and yet think it unlawful to bind him by Force, or even to kill him, in his unlawful Reſiſtance? Suppoſe a Banditti of an Hundred ſtout, reſolute Fellows ſhould aſſemble together, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Murthers, Rapes, Robberies, deſtroy and lay waſte all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; what ſtead do you think the Conſtables and their Staves would ſtand you in, in order to ſubdue ſo many aſſociated Villains; and more eſpecially, if it be not lawful even for the Conſtables to make any Uſe of their Staves in Caſe of Reſiſtance. If it be ſaid, that a Conſtable, being an Officer of the Law, may be allowed to make Uſe of his Staff in Caſe of Neceſſity, ſeeing the Law has put it into his Ilands; I aſk why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e may not make Uſe of a Gun, or a Sword, in the like Neceſſity, put into his Hands by the ſame Authority. If it be anſwered, that a Gun or a Sword may kill: I reply, ſo may a Conſtable's Staff. And if Conſtables, or other Officers of the Law, may make Uſe of Guns and Swords, in Caſes of Neceſſity, I would willingly be informed, why all other Men have not the ſame Liberty under the like Neceſſity. In a Word, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> to admit the Uſefulneſs of civil Government to Mankind; and yet to advance the Poſition, that Force and all Manner of Self-Defence is unlawful, is a Syſtem full of Inconſiſtencies, and big with Abſurdities and Nonſenſe.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS ſome may think it ſtrange, that I, who have been educated amongſt, and have always profeſs'd myſelf to be of the Society of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſhould, in this publick Manner, declare myſelf ſo oppoſite to their Sentiments, in the Point of Defence. I would have ſuch to believe, that the Love of my Country, the Love of Mankind in general, but above all, the Love of Truth, is of greater Concernment to me, than what is called Uniformity, or the being ſo attached to any particular Party in Religion, as to eſpouſe, or ſeem to eſpouſe, any of the Errors of it. That of the Unlawfulneſs of Self-Defence to Chriſtians, is, to me, a moſt capital Error;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004708_0014_100DC0D9F4EBD230"/>
not only dangerous to Society in general, as I have already ſaid, and inconſiſtent with the very Nature of civil Communities; but, more particularly, of extream Danger to ourſelves, at this critical Conjuncture. His Majeſty is already engaged in a juſt and neceſſary War with <hi>Spain:</hi> And a War with <hi>France</hi> is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally look'd upon as unavoidable. The Province of <hi>Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> and theſe Counties, are in the very Centre of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Colonies in <hi>America.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> are ſettled within a few Days March of our Frontiers to the North-Weſt of us: The Ocean bounds us to the Eaſtward, and will admit of the Landing of any Number of Men, almoſt every where. In Caſe then of War with <hi>France,</hi> ſo much to be apprehended; how diſmal is our Situation! ſeeing we are ſo much expoſed on each Side, and of all his Majeſty's Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> are the only ones that are without Troops, without Arms, and without Ammunition: And all this owing to an Oppoſition in our ſeveral Aſſemblies, made by People whoſe religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion leads them to condemn the Uſe of Arms in general. Military Proviſions can only be made by the Legiſlature. Our Governor, from a Zeal to his Majeſty's Service, and the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſuch of his Majeſty's Subjects as he is by the Royal Authority appointed to protect and govern, has frequently, in vain, warmly recommended this Thing to the Aſſemblies of both Governments; and has been expreſsly anſwered by one of them,
<q>that all Defence was, according to the religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of the Majority of their Houſe, unlawful.</q>
And here I profeſs myſelf at a very great Loſs, in what Manner to juſtify, or even excuſe, the Conduct of my Brethren. The being really principled againſt the Lawfulneſs of Self-Defence, is, in itſelf innocent, as proceeding from an ill-informed Judgment, and only ſhews the Unfitneſs of thoſe who are ſo principled to be imployed in Legiſlation. But when ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by Plotting and Management, procure themſelves to be choſen into the Legiſlature, at a critical Time, meerly to keep out and tie up the Hands of others, whoſe religious Principles leave them at Liberty to provide for the Defence of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in Caſe of a foreign Invaſion; it amounts to a negative Perſecution, and becomes highly blameable. The General Aſſembly of theſe Counties, at the preſſing Inſtance of our Honourable Governor, hath, indeed, very lately paſs'd a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia-Law, in ſpight of the Oppoſition made, by thoſe who affirm all War to be unlawful, who happened to be the Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This is ſo far right, as it is Doing all in our Power; but, in Truth, can be of very little Security to us, ſo long as the Province of <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> continues unprovided of all Means of Defence; and it muſt ever continue ſo unprovided, ſo long
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004708_0015_100DC0DC2217EF90"/>
as nine Tenths of the Members of Aſſembly are ſuch as are perſuaded Defence is unlawful. I therefore thought it, <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> high Time to examine and expoſe a Doctrine ſo abſurd in itſelf, and ſo ruinous in its Conſequences. It has been with this View that I have taken up ſo much of your Time. How well I have ſucceeded in it, I leave others to judge.</p>
