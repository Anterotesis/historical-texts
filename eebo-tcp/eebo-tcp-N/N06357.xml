            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <bibl>1 JOHN IV. 1.</bibl>
                  <p>BELOVED, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God; becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU are doubtleſs, my Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſome of you, ſenſible, that I have publickly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and printed Diſcourſes on the Words now read unto you, about two and twenty Years ago; at a Time when a <hi>Spirit of ſtrong Enthuſiaſm</hi> was making it's Way apace into this Society.
<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſhort Account of this Matter may be ſeen in my Letter to Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> P. 6. 7.</note> But <hi>the Spirit</hi> I am now to <hi>try,</hi> being of a very different Sort from that, will lead me into a Diſcourſe of quite another Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:008064_0004_102E21BB97E89718"/>
THE Buſineſs of the third <hi>Dudleian</hi> Lecture, at this Time aſſigned to me by the Rev'd Truſtees, according to the Will of the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, learned and pious Founder, is <q>to be for the detecting, and convicting and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Idolatry of the Romiſh Church, their Tyranny, Uſurpations, damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, fatal Errors, abominable Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other crying Wickedneſſes in their high Places; and finally to prove, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is that myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> that Man of Sin, that apoſtate Church, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the New-Teſtament.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT when we charge the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with any of theſe Enormities, or with any other Error, either in Faith or Practice; her Advocates think it a ſufficient Anſwer to tell us, <q>Alas, Gentlemen, you are groſly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken! As for theſe Opinions and Practices which you take to be Errors, 'tis your ſelves only that err in thinking them to be ſo; for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo highly privileged, as to be under the conſtant Guidance of an Infallible Spirit. You might as well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imagine that Chriſt and his Apoſtles have erred, as that She hath, or can.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt Thing therefore to be done, in our Diſputes with the Adheren's and Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, ſeems to be this;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008064_0005_102E21BE7A6F0BA0"/>to enquire carefully, Whether their Claim to ſuch an extraordinary Privilege, as the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Guidance of an Infallible Spirit, be well grounded, or not? For on the one Hand, if it be, all Diſpute with them is at an End. We have nothing to do, but to believe as their Church believes; to receive all her Dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates with implicit Faith, and follow them with blind Obedience.— And again, on the other Hand, if this Claim be falſe and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, yet till we convince them of it, they will and muſt remain impenetrable, to any Arguments with which we can preſs them, on other Points. You ſee then, that this is the fundamental Article in the Controverſies between us, and them; and that Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the laſt Importance depend upon it.</p>
            <p>I HOPE therefore we ſhall all with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reverence attend the affectionate Charge of the Apoſtle in my Text, and <hi>not believe this Spirit,</hi> till we have <hi>tried whether it be of God.</hi> And to this, by Divine Aſſiſtance, I ſhall now apply myſelf.—But here ſo many Things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to View, that I find it no eaſy Matter to determine which to paſs in ſilence, ſince I am confined to the Limits of one ſhort Diſcourſe, which can by no means contain them all. I muſt content myſelf therefore to ſelect ſuch Thôts only, as can be beſt crouded into ſo ſmall a Compaſs, without being too much obſcur'd or maim'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:008064_0006_102E21C0170E9298"/>
YOU may obſerve then, that our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the <hi>Papiſts</hi> define <hi>their Church,</hi> to which they arrogate <hi>a Spirit of Infallibility,</hi> to be <hi>that Society of Perſons, who profeſs Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and live in Subjection to, and Communion with the Pope, or Biſhop of</hi> Rome.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Infallibility</hi> they aſcribe to <hi>this Church</hi> is, <hi>That thro' the Aſſiſtance of Chriſt and his Holy Spirit, it not only does not, but cannot err in any Doctrine of Religion.</hi>—Go then ſay they to this Church, and receive the Doctrine which She teaches; and there you have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly, the true and pure Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Jeſus Chriſt. Yea they ſet up the <hi>Dictates of their Church</hi> as a <hi>Rule of Faith and Manners,</hi> diſtinct from, and ſuperior to the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> inaſmuch as they affirm, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> can neither be truly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, nor ſavingly believed, without preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of <hi>their Church</hi> in teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the divine Inſpiration of them; and aſcertaining the Senſe of them; and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adding certain neceſſary <hi>Traditions</hi> of the ſame Original and Authority with them.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>Infallibility</hi> they place, not in the Church <hi>Diffuſive,</hi> but in the Church <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative.</hi> But who the <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of <hi>their Church</hi> endowed with this <hi>Infallibility</hi> is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Pope,</hi> who is the Head of it; or a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008064_0007_102E21C1A80DEBE8"/>
               <hi>General Council</hi> of its Biſhops and Doctors; or <hi>both together;</hi> they are at no Agreement among themſelves. And we are not at all concerned to help them in adjuſting their own Differences; thò methinks it looks with but an ill Aſpect on their pretended Infallibility, that it hath never yet been at Leiſure, or in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to decide a Controverſy in which it is ſo much concerned; and on which all its Uſefulneſs to the Church is ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>FOR till this Point is determined, how ſhall the Church <hi>Diffuſive,</hi> or any of its Members, know on whom to depend, or where to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for infallible Guidance, in any Matter of Faith or Practice. I think with the learned Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> 
               <q>That every Side does ſo effectually confute the other, that I believe them all as to <hi>that:</hi> And think they argue much ſtronger when they prove where it cannot be, than when they pretend to prove where it muſt be.</q> And if the Time would allow, it would be both an agreable and edifying Amuſement, to take a View of their Arguments one againſt another, on this Subject, wherein it ſo much concerns them to be all of one Mind.</p>
            <p>BUT the Limits to which I am confined will not ſuffer me on this Occaſion to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to prove <hi>ſeparately,</hi> either by <hi>their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:008064_0008_102E21C472A2D848"/>of one Party againſt another, or by <hi>any of my own,</hi> that neither <hi>Pope,</hi> nor <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council,</hi> nor <hi>both together,</hi> are <hi>guided by an Infallible Spirit in delivering the Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi>—It will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer all the Ends I aim at, if I can prove <hi>at once,</hi> That <hi>no ſuch Aſſiſtance of Chriſt and his Holy Spirit is vouchſafed any where in the</hi> Romiſh Church, <hi>as infallibly ſecures it from erring in any Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PERHAPS the ſhorteſt Way of proving this would be, to ſhew that <hi>that Church</hi> not only <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>actually hath,</hi> erred exceedingly in ſome Doctrines authoriſed by both <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> ſo contrary both to Senſe and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as well as Scripture; that we, who live ſo far remov'd from the Seat of pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, have more and better Aſſurances that thoſe Doctrines muſt be notoriouſly falſe; than we have, or poſſibly can have, that there is, or ever was, either <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>General Council</hi> in the World, to enjoin us to believe them.</p>
            <p>BUT this would lead me to take up moſt of the Time in expoſing the Abſurdity of ſome <hi>other Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and to deduce the Falſehood and Arrogance of their Claim to <hi>Infallibity,</hi> only by Way of Inference from it; which tho' I believe the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008064_0009_102E21C8C85E70D8"/>ſhorteſt, would yet look like a more indirect Method of Proceedure; and might perhaps prevent ſome of my Succeſſors in this Lecture, from attempting to expoſe ſuch a falſe Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, in a more effectual manner, than I am able to do.—I ſhall therefore take another Courſe, and confine myſelf intirely to the ſingle Point before me, by endeavouring to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I.</hi> THAT it is evident, both from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing, and from the Account which they themſelves give of the Infallibility they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, that we can have no good Reaſon to believe ſuch Infallibility lodged any where in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, without ſome divine Promiſe to found our Belief of it upon. <hi>And,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>II.</hi> THAT none of the Promiſes alledged for this Purpoſe, intend or prove any ſuch Thing.</p>
            <p>Now if I can make it appear, that none of the Promiſes alledged intimate any ſuch Thing, as the Conduct of an infallible Spirit in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Doctrines of Religion, to be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any where in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; and if I can prove, that we can have no good Reaſon to believe any ſuch Conduct vouchſafed to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, without a divine Promiſe of it; 'twill thence plainly follow, that we ought not to believe the <hi>Romiſh Spirit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility;</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:008064_0010_102E21CA55CB8B48"/>but ſhould reckon the Pretenders to it, among the <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> of whom we are warned in my Text.</p>
            <p>Here then,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I. I AM to prove,</hi> That it is evident both from the Nature of the Thing, and from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which they themſelves give, of the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they pretend to, that we can have no good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe ſuch Infallibility lodged any where in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, without ſome divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to found our Belief of it upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">ſt</hi>. <hi>THIS is evident from the Nature of the Thing itſelf.</hi>—For it cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that God is under any Neceſſity of Nature, or Obligation in Point of Juſtice, unleſs he hath laid himſelf under one by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to beſtow the infallible Conduct of his Holy Spirit in delivering the Doctrines of Religion, upon any Perſon or Community whatever: And much leſs can it be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that he is under any Neceſſity or Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to beſtow it upon one particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Church, rather than another. And therefore, if God does vouchſafe the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Guidance of his Holy Spirit in delivering the Doctrines of Religion to <hi>any Church;</hi> and more eſpecially if he does it to <hi>one Church</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of <hi>all others,</hi> it muſt be allowed by all to be an Act entirely <hi>free</hi> and <hi>arbitrary.</hi> And
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008064_0011_102E21CCCAA8F548"/>if ſo, then it can never be known <hi>what Church</hi> God ſo highly favours, or whether he do ſo by <hi>any;</hi> unleſs we know that he hath made ſome antecedent Promiſe that he will: Or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he bares Witneſs to the Pretenſions of his favourite Church, with ſuch miraculous Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and apparent Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, as it would be inconſiſtent for the God of Truth to confirm a Lie with.—But now the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> I think, don't preſume to ſay, that their Church is endowed with any miraculous Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, to confirm its Pretenſions to <hi>Infallibility.</hi> For thô they ſtudy to perſwade the World, that Miracles are ſtill among them; yet they do not ſo much as ſay, that the Miracles are wrought by thoſe, with whom this Infallibility is lodged; or that they are done to prove them to be Infallible. And therefore, Since the Gift of Infallibility is an arbitrary Thing, and they don't pretend to prove they have it by Miracles; if they can ever prove that their Church hath it, they can do it only by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſome Promiſe of God to beſtow it on them. But what wretched Contradiction, Confuſion, and Circulation will this unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably run them into? For according to their Principles, we can neither be aſſured that the Scriptures are the Word of God, nor be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what is the Meaning of the Promiſes of them; unleſs we firſt believe the Infallibility
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008064_0012_102E21D132A40510"/>of their Church in teſtifying the divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scriptures, and aſcertaining the Senſe of them. And yet when we enquire, how we ſhall be aſſured of the pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of their Church, it is evident from the Nature of the Thing itſelf, compared with their own Principles and Conceſſions, that they can never prove it, unleſs they can find ſome Promiſe of it in the Scriptures.—So that we muſt believe their Church to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, before we can either believe, or know the Meaning of the Scriptures; and yet we muſt believe their Church Infallible, becauſe they pretend that the Scriptures ſay it is. But this is only to run round in a Circle, and favours ſo little of a Spirit of Infallibility, that we hardly need enquire, whether the Scriptures have promiſed them Infallibility, or no. <q>For it is an eternal Principle and Rule of Reaſon (as hath been frequently obſerved upon this Occaſion) never to prove one Thing by another, till that other is firſt well proved, if it be not a ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Truth: Nor can any Thing be proved afterwards by that, which was firſt proved by it. This is as impoſſible, as if a Father ſhould beget a Son, and ſhould be after wards begotten by that Son.</q> Therefore the Scriptures cannot prove the Infallibility of the Church, ſince their Authority (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principles) muſt firſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008064_0013_102E21D2C5C14828"/>by the Churches Teſtimony.—Thus much for the Nature of the Thing it ſelf. I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>IT is likewiſe evident from the Account which the</hi> Romaniſts <hi>themſelves give of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility which they aſcribe to their Church, that we can have no good Reaſon to believe any ſuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility confer'd upon it, without ſome Divine Promiſe to found our Belief of it upon.</hi>—The Account they give of the Matter is, that it is by <hi>the Aſſiſtance of Chriſt and his Holy Spirit, that their Church cannot err in any Doctrine of Religion.</hi> From whence it is plain, that in order to believing their Churches Infallibility, we muſt believe, that the Perſon or Perſons who conſtitute their <hi>Church-Repreſentative,</hi> (as they call it) whether <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Council,</hi> or <hi>both together</hi> we cannot tell; nor hath their Infallibility ever yet been ſo kind as to inform us in a Point ſo neceſſary to our Salvation; that this Perſon or Perſons, I ſay, are aſſiſted by Chriſt and his Holy Spirit. But this will both run them again into a Circle; and alſo prove the Neceſſity of ſome Promiſes to found ſuch a Belief upon.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>IT will run them again into a circular Argumentation.</hi>—For how ſhall we be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that their Church hath the Aſſiſtance, the Infallible Aſſiſtance, of Chriſt and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008064_0014_102E21D5772D7530"/>Ghoſt. We ſhould never have known that there were ſuch Divine Perſons as Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt, if the Scriptures had not revealed them to us. They tell us, we can neither ſavingly believe, nor underſtand the Scriptures, without the Infallible Teſtimony and Interpretation of their Church: That is in effect, we cannot believe that there are ſuch Perſons as Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt, unleſs we firſt believe their Church to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; and yet we cannot believe their Church to be Infallible, unleſs we believe that there are ſuch Perſons as Chriſt and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; for its Infallibility, by their own Confeſſion, doth ſuppoſe the peculiar Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of both theſe. And none can believe their Aſſiſtance before he believes they are. But leaving them in the midſt of this Circle, I proceed to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THAT in order to our believing that Church favoured with the Infallible Aſſiſtance of Chriſt and the Holy Spirit, we muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity have ſome Promiſe to it of ſuch Aſſiſtance, to found our Faith upon.</hi>—<q>For how comes this Church to have this Infallible Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? We can well enough ſuppoſe, that Chriſt and the Holy Spirit may exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving this Aſſiſtance. And we can ſuppoſe, that the Chriſtian Religion may very well continue in the World, after that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008064_0015_102E21D8D85A5060"/>all the Doctrines and Precepts of it have been committed to Writing by Men under the Conduct of an Infallible Spirit, without the Continuance of ſuch an Infallibility in the Church. This Aſſiſtance therefore is not a <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but a <hi>free Act.</hi> And if a <hi>free Act,</hi> then for ought that they know, their Church may not be ſo aſſiſted. For whence can they be ſure of an <hi>arbitrary</hi> Thing, unleſs the <hi>Authors</hi> of this Aſſiſtance have engaged themſelves by <hi>Promiſe,</hi> to give their Church, that Infallible Aſſiſtance? So that is impoſſible for them to prove ſuch an Infallible Aſſiſtance of Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt, unleſs they produce ſome expreſs Promiſe for it.—And ſhould they produce any ſuch Promiſes, they will ſtill be liable to be queſtioned, how they are ſure that theſe are <hi>Divine</hi> Promiſes? When the Knowlege that they are <hi>Divine,</hi> muſt ſuppoſe the Thing to be <hi>true,</hi> which they would prove out of them; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>their Church is Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible?</hi> And ſuppoſing the Promiſes <hi>Divine,</hi> how are they ſure, that <hi>this</hi> and no <hi>other</hi> is the Meaning of them? When from ſuch Places they prove, that <hi>their Church</hi> is the only <hi>Infallible Interpreter</hi> of Scripture.</q>— But waving any further Advantage which might be made of their loſing themſelves perpetually in ſuch inextricable Labyrinths, I ſhall proceed to ſhew,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:008064_0016_102E21DC14F05618"/>
II. <hi>THAT none of the Promiſes ordinarily alledged to prove the Infallibility of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church, can poſſibly mean any ſuch Thing.</hi>—Theſe Promiſes are of two Sorts, namely, ſuch as are pleaded by them, who imagine the Spirit of Infallibility to reſide in the <hi>Pope alone;</hi> or ſuch as are urged by them, who place it in a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council,</hi> or in <hi>Pope and Council.</hi>—I ſhall conſider the Allegations of both Sorts diſtinctly, but as briefly as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THEY who place Infallibility in the <hi>Pope alone,</hi> think it is well proved in general, that there muſt be an Infallibility in the Church; and from hence they conclude, that it muſt be in the <hi>Pope.</hi> For if there muſt be a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeaking Judge, always ready to guide the Church, and to decide Controverſies, they ſay this cannot be in the <hi>diffuſive</hi> Body of Chriſtians, for theſe cannot meet to judge; nor can it be in a <hi>General Council,</hi> the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which depends upon ſo many Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and on the Conſent of ſo many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the Infallibility muſt lie dormant frequently for whole Ages together, if the <hi>General Council,</hi> or <hi>Pope and Council</hi> is the Seat of it. And therefore, taking it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that it is certainly in the <hi>Church,</hi> they conclude it can be no where elſe but in the <hi>Pope</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">BURNET'S Exp. P. 180.</note>.</q>—The chief Proof they alledge from Scripture, is taken from the Words of

But this is far from proving, that they ſhall never be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to err in ſuch Points, as are not abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation.

            <p>THE firſt Text urged upon this Occaſion is that of our Saviour to the Seventy,

(1.) EVEN the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves ſeem not to have had the conſtant infallible Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Spirit of God, 'till after Chriſt's Aſcenſion.—And then much leſs can we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the <hi>Seventy</hi> Diſciples had, who are here ſpoken of.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THE Meſſage they were ſent up on did not at all require any infallible Aſſiſtance.— For they were <hi>ſent two and two before Chriſt's Face, into every City and Place whither he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would come,</hi> 
               <q>not to deliver fully the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Chriſt, but only to tell the People that <hi>the Kingdom of God was at Hand:</hi> That is, that bleſſed State of Things under the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is now ready to be revealed to you. The whole Deſign therefore of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the <hi>Seventy</hi> was, to prepare People for the Reception of that Doctrine, which Chriſt himſelf was about to deliver to them.

(1.) THE Seventy were ſent abroad by Chriſt when there were yet no infallible Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings containing his Doctrine, made by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or his Apoſtles, or other inſpired Perſons. —And ſo <hi>the Seventy</hi> had more need of the immediate Guidance of the Spirit of God <hi>then,</hi> than the <hi>Church</hi> can have <hi>now;</hi> ſince that the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt hath been publiſhed to the World by the Writings of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in the New-Teſtament, ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and clearly, <hi>that the Man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good Works by them.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3.17.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THE Seventy had ſufficient Evidences to atteſt their Infallibility if they had it, by the Power given them to caſt out Devils, and heal Diſeaſes. —<q>And therefore thoſe they were ſent to, had ſufficient Inducement to believe ſuch an Infallibility if they pretended to it. When therefore our Adverſaries can produce the like Credentials, for their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Paſtors, either apart, or in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, they may then perhaps from hence argue ſomething in Favour of their Infallibility, but not before.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN it is pleaded, that Chriſt ſays, <hi>Tell the Church; and if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man, and a Publican.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Math. 18.17.</note> — But what is it, which is here
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:008064_0022_102E21EA0BA049B0"/>to be told to the Church? Not a Doubt about any Point of Doctrine, but a Complaint of Treſpaſs of one Brother againſt another. So that if Infallibility is promiſed in theſe Words, 'tis Infallibility, not in determining the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Religion, but in judging Matters of Treſpaſs. — Again, What Church is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to? Not the Church Catholick, conven'd in General Council, but the private Chriſtian Aſſembly, to which the aggrieved Brother belongs. He was firſt to uſe his own private Endeavours; then the Interpoſition of Friends was to be tried; and if that was without Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, the Matter was to be referred to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, to which they belonged. So that if infallible Guidance in Judgment can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from this Paſſage, it may be claimed by every private Chriſtian Aſſembly; and ſurely then there can be no need of travelling to a <hi>Popiſh</hi> General Council to obtain it.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Place alledged is that Promiſe of our Saviour,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Math. 28.20.</note> 
               <hi>I am with you always, even to the End of the World.</hi>—This implies Chriſt's ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Preſence with his Miniſters. And this Promiſe of Chriſt's ſpiritual Preſence, was to the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, as well as to themſelves; for it reaches to the End of the World. But then, this Promiſe intends only <hi>continual</hi> Aſſiſtance, and not <hi>infallible.</hi> For whatever is here promiſed to the Apoſtles, is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008064_0023_102DCB822296B0C8"/>promiſed to each of them <hi>ſingly,</hi> and therefore cannot with any good Reaſon be reſtrained to their Succeſſors taken <hi>collectively.</hi> Whereas our Adverſaries themſelves do not pretend, that each of the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles <hi>ſingly,</hi> is render'd Infallible, by virtue of this Promiſe.</p>
            <p>BESIDES (as hath already been obſerved) there is not the ſame Reaſon, that the Paſtors of the Church collectively ſhould be infallible <hi>now,</hi> which there was for the Apoſtles being ſo <hi>then.</hi> Nor can they produce the ſame Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for their being ſo, which the Apoſtles did. Nor can any good Reaſon be drawn from this Promiſe, for Infallibility to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of the Apoſtles in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and not <hi>elſewhere.</hi>—So that this Text alſo may be diſmiſſed, as of no Uſe to our Adverſaries.</p>
            <p>NOR is <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. alledged to any better Purpoſe.—For <hi>Guidance into all Truth by the Spirit</hi> is there promiſed to none, but ſuch as have it promiſed to them alſo, that the <hi>Spirit will ſhew them Things to come.</hi> And therefore, that Promiſe muſt be reſtrained to the Apoſtles, and not extended to their Succeſſors. For I think the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> do not pretend their Church is endowed with a <hi>Spirit of Prophecy,</hi> as well as of <hi>Infallibility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR laſtly, will it prove their Pretenſions, if <hi>the Church of the living God</hi> is called the <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008064_0024_102E21EE01CB84B8"/>and Ground of Truth, 1 Tim.</hi> 3.15.—For that is only becauſe it is <hi>built upon the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtles and Prophets;</hi> which the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church can ſcarce be allowed to be, ſince it lays it's own <hi>Infallibility</hi> in the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and builds both <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> upon <hi>that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER it ought to be obſerved, that if it was <hi>a Church</hi> which is here called <hi>the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Ground of Truth,</hi> it was not the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Church in which <hi>Timothy</hi> was directed how to behave himſelf, namely the Church of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> And that this Church hath erred fundamentally muſt needs be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince, as Hiſtorians tell us, there is not one Family of Chriſtians now to be found in <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT after all, I think with an eminent Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. SHARP.</note>, that it is <hi>Timothy himſelf,</hi> and not the <hi>Church of Epheſus,</hi> which is here called <hi>a Pillar and Support of the Truth:</hi> that the Paſſage ſhould be rendered, <hi>that thou mayſt know how to behave thy ſelf in the Houſe of God, which is the Church of the living God,</hi> as a <hi>Pillar and Support of the Truth.</hi> 
               <q>The Apoſtle is giving Rules to <hi>Timothy,</hi> how to behave himſelf in the Church, which He calls <hi>the Houſe of God.</hi> Now after he had called it <hi>an Houſe,</hi> one would think it not proper, that in the ſame Breath, he ſhould call it a <hi>Pillar</hi> of an Houſe.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008064_0025_102E21F063004808"/>But it is very natural to give that Name to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and to exhort him to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as ſuch in the Houſe of God.</q> And if you take it in this Senſe, it is as far off from the Purpoſe they alledge it for, as that of their <hi>angelick Doctor</hi>

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Job. 1.14.</note>.</p>
            <p>THESE are the principal Texts alledged by thoſe who place the Infallibility in a <hi>General Council</hi> of ſuch as live in Subjection to, and Communion with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> And concerning them all I think it will hold true, that any other Chriſtian Church may put in as fair a Claim to what they Promiſe, as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that we muſt either believe, that <hi>all</hi> Churches are Infallible, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church is ſo. For where all have an equal Claim with her, it is very plain that the Claim of all muſt be juſt, or elſe that her Claim cannot be ſo. — Now that all Chriſtian Churches are not Infallible, we need no other Proof, but their Contradictions one to another. And therefore we need not be at a Loſs what to think of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, unleſs ſome Promiſe of Infallibility could be produced which reſpected her, more than others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:008064_0026_102E21F1F4DEA330"/>
AND now the Sum of all is, That <hi>that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> which cannot ſtand the Teſt, ought not to be <hi>believed:</hi> that the Spirit of Infallibility contended for by the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> can never be proved without ſome expreſs Scripture Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of it to them: that for them to betake themſelves to Scripture Proof upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is to involve themſelves in ſuch Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Contradictions, as would better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any Thing elſe, than Infallibility: that if waving the Advantages this would give us, we attend to the Promiſes alledged, we find none of them can, without manifeſt Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, be interpreted of a <hi>ſtanding, perpetual</hi> Infallibility in the Church: And laſtly, that if, contrary to the Truth, we ſhould ſuppoſe this to be the obvious Intention of them all; yet not one of them hath more reſpect to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, than to any other.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe Things laid together, it will be no difficult or unfair Concluſion, that the Infallibility which the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> arrogate to their Church is not from the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> but from a <hi>Spirit of Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND now (to borrow the Words of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Exp. P. 152.</note>) <q>the Importance of this Argument, rather than the Difficulty of it, hath made it neceſſary to dwell ſo long upon it. For it is indeed, the main funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008064_0027_102E21F46248AC20"/>Point in Debate between <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and upon which, in a manner all the other Points of Difference do depend. Since then ſo much depends upon it, and ſince the Miſſionaries of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are generally very well inſtructed in it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be thorôly conſidered. For how little Strength ſoever there may be in the Arguments brought to prove this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yet they put ſpecious Colours upon them, and they are commonly managed, both with much Art, and with great Confidence.</q> But the only infallible Rule in this, as in all other Points of Importance, is, <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony: If they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi>

            <p>OUR Adverſaries the <hi>Papiſts</hi> dare not deny, that the Holy Scriptures were <hi>all given by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God:</hi> And ſurely then we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, if we can but underſtand them. The Scriptures themſelves aſſure us, that <hi>they are able to make us wiſe unto Salvation,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. 3.15.</note> and that they may be <hi>known of children;</hi> which certainly ſuppoſes, that however there may be <hi>ſome Things in them hard to be underſtood,</hi> yet that in all Points neceſſary to Salvation, they are written with Perſpicuity enough to be apprehended by very ordinary Capacities. What need then can there be of an infallible Interpreter, to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008064_0028_102E21F5F8E6ECD0"/>explain the Meaning of what a Child may know without ſuch Help? And where ſhall we find ſuch Interpreter, if we needed him; ſince the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all it's Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, cannot determine, whether it be <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>General Council,</hi> or <hi>both together?</hi> And what Help or Satisfaction ſhall we find if we look into the Deciſions of that Church; ſince it is certain that its Definitions in Matters of Faith, are both more in Number, and much more intricate and hard to be underſtood, than thoſe of the Scripture are?— But I am inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſliding into the Conſideration of what may be urged <hi>in Point of Reaſon</hi> againſt the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine of Infallibility; to take a juſt View of <hi>which</hi> would probably far exceed, both your Patience, and my own Strength.</p>
            <p>I MUST therefore leave this, together with the ſeveral intereſting and important Points expreſſed in the Statute of the worthy Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of theſe Lectures, which I read unto you at the Beginning of this Diſcourſe, to ſuch as by the Will of God may ſucceed me.—I muſt alſo wave the Reflections which offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon what hath been ſpoken at this Time: And ſhall conclude in one Word of Advice, to ſuch of you, my Hearers, as intend the Study of Divinity; namely,</p>
            <p>THAT after you have laid the Foundations of your Faith in the great Points of natural
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008064_0029_102E21FA2F23C3A8"/>and revealed Religion, in Oppoſition to the Atheiſt and the Deiſt, as deep and ſtrong as you can; if you find Leiſure and Advantages to look much into the Controverſies between the ſeveral Denominations of Chriſtians, you would begin with that between <hi>us</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>—<hi>That Church</hi> is a reſtleſs, incroaching and implacable Enemy to <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> of every Denomination. It is indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable in it's Endeavours, <hi>compaſſing Land and Sea to make Proſelytes.</hi> It utterly denies Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to any out of it's Communion. And it's Hereſies, Superſtitions, Cruelties, Idolatries, and other crying Wickedneſſes are ſuch, that you will find it no very eaſy Matter to perſwade your ſelves, that there can be any Salvation in it. This is doubtleſs therefore, the moſt intereſting and important Controverſy among Chriſtians; and ſo deſerves your Attention in the firſt Place. And you will find that a competent Underſtanding of this, will be no ſmall Help to you in determining ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between <hi>Proteſtants</hi> one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—To which I may add, that if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how much the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> is at this Day threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the Sword of its <hi>Popiſh</hi> Enemies; this is the Controverſy in which it ſeems moſt likely that we may be bro't to the Trial, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are <hi>rooted</hi> and <hi>grounded</hi> in our Faith, and can <hi>hold faſt the Profeſſion of it, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering.</hi>
