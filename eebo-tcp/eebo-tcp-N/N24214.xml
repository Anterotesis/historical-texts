            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>THESE HAVE POWER TO SHUT HEAVEN IN THE DAYS OF THEIR PROPHECY, AND HAVE POWER OVER WATERS TO TURN THEM INTO BLOOD, AND TO SMITE THE EARTH WITH ALL PLAGUES AS OFTEN AS THEY WILL.</p>

            <p>ALREADY I hear the objection, "What proper employment has the ſpeaker here in theſe deep waters, where ſo many have ſounded and found no bottom?" But ſuch an objector would do well to conſider, that the book before us is the book of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and not of concealment. In the time of the prophet Daniel, it was cloſed up and ſealed with ſeven ſeals, and ſo was to continue till the time of the end. Behold now is the time of the end, and one ſeal is taken off after another by the wondrous works of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence! And even the ſeventh ſeal
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032007_0004_0FF09E90C8D06C88"/>is now opening by the concurrent explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of preſent expoſitors. Hence the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of this part of ſcripture increaſes from age to age. The book of Revelation was not put into our hands for no purpoſe: It is a greater benefit to us than to thoſe in former ages: It was written more eſpecially for our learning on whom the ends of the world are come: And he is pronounced bleſſed, who reads and hears the words of this prophecy, (Rev. i. 3) and keeps the ſayings which are written therein, which fairly implies that we ſhould labour to underſtand what we read and hear. But on the other hand, we ſhould be careful to maintain Chriſtian modeſty, and not pronounce, too poſitively where there is but feeble evidence; and a ſenſe of our mental imbecility ſhould be joined with a ſpirit of prayer, that Chriſt, would open our underſtandings to underſtand the ſcriptures. Infinite Mercy grant this humility and light, while it is conſidered,</p>
            <p>Who theſe are, which have power to ſhut heaven and to ſmite the earth.</p>
            <p>What thoſe plagues are with which they ſmite the earth. And</p>
            <p>What is meant by their ſmiting the earth as often as they will.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who are theſe which have power to ſhut heaven, and to ſmite the earth?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:032007_0005_0FF09E5FD5EBE870"/>
We fine by the chapter that they are two prophets, two witneſſes, two candleſticks, and two olive trees, which ſtand before the God of the earth. And here we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the ſcripture is the interpreter of itſelf: There are, perhaps, few paſſages of ſcripture, which have not a key for them, if we can tell where to find it and how to improve it. Let us then inquire whether a key may not be found for the particular paſſage in view. Theſe two witneſſes are the two candleſticks, ſays the context: But what are the two candleſticks? is the next inquiry. Look in Zech. iv. 2, 6. 'And he ſaid unto me, What ſeeſt thou? And I ſaid, I have looked, and behold a candleſtick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his ſeven lamps thereon, and ſeven pipes to the ſeven lamps which are upon the top thereof; and two olive trees by it, one on the right ſide of the bowl, and the other on the left ſide thereof. So I anſwered and ſpake to the angel, What are theſe, my lord? Then he anſwered and ſpake unto me ſaying. <hi>This is the word of the Lord, &amp;c.'</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">To Zerubbabel. But of the ſame nature is the inſpired ſcripture.</note> i. e. <hi>this candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, with the things, which accompany it, is the word of the Lord.</hi> The word of the Lord, we know, is the inſpired ſcripture. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this candleſtick muſt be, that which is now the inſpired ſcripture, and ſo the two candleſticks muſt be the two ſcriptures, the old Teſtament and the New. Zechariah
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032007_0006_0FF09E9377697C60"/>ſaw but one candleſtick; for in his time there was but one Teſtament revealed; but John diſcovers two; for then both Teſtaments were revealed; both candleſticks were light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up.</p>
            <p>The two olive trees may <hi>perhaps</hi> ſignify Joſhua and Zerubbabel, as types of the law and goſpel. For as Joſhua and Zerubbabel were two great inſtruments in the hand of Chriſt to build the ſecond temple; ſo are the law and goſpel for building the antitype of the ſecond temple, which is the church of the living God, built on the <hi>foundation of the apoſtles and prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oil is the ſcripture emblem of the effuſions of the Spirit. And as the oil of the two olive trees was poured into the bowl of the candleſtick and lighted up all the ſeven lamps; ſo all the eſſential ſpiritual truths, which partake of the nature both of the law and goſpel, were by the Holy Spirit poured into one Old Teſtament, and conſtituted a perfect light. For though the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a light ſhining in a dark place, yet it was a perfect one; it contained both the law and the goſpel; it contained all that was neceſſary to practiſe or believe in order to ſalvation; and both Teſtaments ſubſtantially contain no more. While Zechariah ſaw one candleſtick, he beheld two olive trees, and while John ſaw two candleſticks, he beheld <hi>no more</hi> than two olive trees.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:032007_0007_0FF09E6164813ED0"/>
As to the ſeven lamps, ſeven we know is the number of perfection. The Lamb has ſeven eyes and ſeven horns, perfect wiſdom and perfect power. So theſe ſeven lamps ſignify the perfect light of the ſcriptures; for thy word, ſays David, is a light unto my feet and a lamp to my path, and the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul.</p>
            <p>That theſe two witneſſes, propheſying in ſackcloth, muſt ſignify the Old and New Teſtament, will further appear, if we conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the main deſign of this book of Revelation, which was to ſupport and comfort the church wading through Pagan and Popiſh perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to promiſe her a complete deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from all her dangers. Now, one of the greateſt dangers to which the church was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in thoſe dark times, was that of loſing the Bible: It was in imminent danger not only of being groſsly corrupted, but wholly extirpated from the earth. The Bible is the good man's book, better to him than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of gold and ſilver. What would have become of the woman of Sarepta in the time of famine in Iſrael, if Elijah had not been there to feed her with oil? and what would have become of the woman in the wilderneſs in the time of Popiſh famine, if theſe two prophets had not been there to feed her with the oil of the ſanctuary? Therefore, is it not highly reaſonable to expect that a few verſes, at leaſt, of this prophecy ſhould be ſet apart to give promiſes of ſecurity to a book ſo
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032007_0008_0FF09E9502973928"/>precious to the church, and which Chriſt foreſaw would be expoſed to ſuch imminent danger; but if no ſuch particular promiſes are found in this eleventh chapter, they are not found at all in the whole book of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>Again; we have further confirmation of what is now advanced, by conſidering how unnaturally this prophecy is explained by thoſe who have fixed a different meaning to it. Some have ſuppoſed, that goſpel miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and magiſtrates, others that true Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in general, and the Waldenſes in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, are intended by theſe witneſſes. But what key does the ſcripture afford for this explanation? And, if there is none, what is this but a mere conjectural gloſs? Neither common Chriſtians, miniſters nor magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates are ever called prophets in other parts of ſcripture: And why ſhould there be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly two prophets and no more for one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and ſixty years? Why not rather one hundred and forty-four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, beſide a great multitude? for this is is the enumeration of common Chriſtians in other parts of this book. If the number <hi>two</hi> ſignify only a ſmall indefinite number, and their reſurrection is the multiplication of their number, as ſo many ſuppoſe, ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to be aſſigned why, at leaſt, as many as three witneſſes do not appear after their reſurrection; but this chapter mentions
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032007_0009_0FF09E6385EA4458"/>no more than two after their reſurrection, at well as, before.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the powers aſcribed to theſe two witneſſes are very unnaturally applied to common Chriſtians or goſpel miniſters. When. did the Waldenſes or other Chriſtians ever ſhut up heaven? When did they turn the waters into blood? When did fire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of their mouths to devour their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies? Or what have they done to which theſe mighty works may be compared by any proper figure of ſpeech? To evade the force of this argument, it has been anſwered that <hi>the ſaints may be ſaid to inflict theſe plagues on the earth by praying that God would be avenged on their enemies;</hi> but this anſwer is by no means ſatisfactory. When did they ever pray that heaven might be ſhut up, or that the waters might be turned into blood, in what ſenſe ſoever theſe, plagues may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood? Never. This conſtruction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is quite unnatural, and aſſigns thoſe powers to magiſtrates, miniſters and other Chriſtians, which can in no ſenſe belong to them by any figure of ſpeech which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble elſewhere uſes. Yet theſe miraculous powers are very applicable to prophets, and conſequently to the two Teſtaments, which contain the voice of all the prophets ſince the world began.</p>
            <p>The death and reſurrection of theſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes remarkably agree with the treatment which the two Teſtaments have ſuffered from
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032007_0010_0FF09E97804AC888"/>the oppoſition of their enemies, and their glorious triumph over them. 'When they ſhall have finiſhed their teſtimony (in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth) the beaſt, which aſcendeth out of the bottomleſs pit, ſhall make war againſt them, and ſhall overcome them, and kill them.' Rev. xi. 7. That is, the antichriſtian party in a large and general council at Baſil, in 1437, formed a decree, that it was the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>the church</hi> to determine in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the worſhip of God ſhould be carried on. This blow, to ſpeak ſigurately, took away the very life of the ſcriptures, and all that for which they excel every other book in the world. At that time, the four antichriſtian parties, which had been at variance by means of three cotemporary Popes and a difference with reſpect to communion, were reconciled; as Pilate and Herod were at the crucifixion of our Lord. This union is here expreſſed by their making merry, and ſending gifts one to another. 'And they ſuffered not their dead bodies to be put in graves;' that is, <hi>They would not ſuffer them to be buried wholly out of their ſight.</hi> To bury a deceaſed perſon is to manifeſt reſpect for him, and peculiar ſorrow for the calamity which has befallen him: Therefore, the meaning of the figure may be this; <hi>The Papiſts would not ſuffer any one to pay that reſpect to the ſcriptures which was due, or even to mourn for the bold impiety which they had committed!</hi>

               <hi>Three days and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032007_0011_0FF09E65239CAF18"/>an half they remained in this condition, then roſe and ſtood on their feet.</hi> About three years and an half after this Popiſh decree, the teſtimony of ſcripture was revived and appeared anew, in the reformation formed by the Bohemian brethren, after they had ſeparated from the Calixtines. Soon after this, the voice was heard, 'Come up hither. And they aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to heaven in a cloud, and their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies beheld them;' i. e. the Greeks flying from Conſtantinople brought the knowledge of the ſcriptures into the Weſt, and about the ſame time the two Teſtaments were publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly printed in Germany, and by Proteſtant protection aſcended up out of the reach of their enemies, as much as if they had gone up to heaven, ſo that the Papiſts could not command them any longer from that day to this.</p>
            <p>Finally, It is the part of a witneſs to teſtify for or againſt any perſon or thing. Chriſt plainly tells us, that the ſcriptures are his witneſſes, when he ſays, 'Search the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which <hi>teſtify</hi> of me.</p>
            <p n="2">II. What are thoſe plagues with which they ſmite the earth?</p>
            <p>Smiting the earth here may mean no other than the voice of their prophecy, declaring that certain plagues ſhall afflict mankind. As by a common figure of ſpeech any one may
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032007_0012_0FF09E99682081B8"/>be ſaid to puniſh another, when he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſentence of puniſhment againſt him, which is connected with the event; ſo theſe two prophets, by denouncing certain plagues againſt the earth, may be properly ſaid to ſmite the earth with theſe plagues. Thus the prophet Eliſha ſmote Gehazi by denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing againſt him that plague of leproſy, which ſhould cleave to him and his ſeed forever. So the prophet Elijah ſmote the two captains and their fifties. 'If I be a man of God,' he ſays, 'let fire come down from heaven and conſume thee and thy fifty.' Therefore the plagues with which the witneſſes ſmite the earth, are temporal, ſpiritual and eternal. All temporal judgments, earthquakes, ſword, famine, peſtilence and beaſts of the earth are inflicted on mankind by theſe two witneſſes declaring the exiſtence of them by the voice of their prophecy.</p>
            <p>In the ſame manner they ſmite the earth with ſpiritual judgments; a ſeared conſcience, a blinded mind, and an awful ſterility under the means of grace. Iſa. vi. 9, 10. 'Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not; ſee ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes: left they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart, and convert and be healed.' With this ſpiritual calamity were the unbelieving Jews ſmitten at Rome, while 'they heard Paul perſuading
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032007_0013_0FF09E670D3CCB40"/>them the things concerning Jeſus from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to evening, both out of the law and out of the prophets.' Paul then quoted the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage now mentioned, as moſt ſolemnly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to their ſpiritual condition.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort are the plagues ſpoken of in the text. They are evidently of a ſpiritual nature, becauſe no ſuch plagues have ever been literally inflicted on mankind ſince the apoſtolic age. Heaven has not been ſhut up one thouſand two hundred and ſixty years, nor the waters turned into blood in a literal ſenſe; but in a ſpiritual ſenſe how awfully manifeſt have been theſe plagues in the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world! There has been a great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible famine in the Chriſtian world; not of bread and water, but of hearing the word of the Lord for one thouſand two hundred and ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty years: That is, from nearly the end of the ſecond century<note n="*" place="bottom">Then the ſcripture doctrine began to be explained by Gentile philoſophy, and to be united with tradition as the rule of faith. And after printing was invented, in 1440, ſcholaſtic divinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſail.</note> to nearly the middle of the fifteenth.</p>
            <p>A lively type of this was the famine in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael in the days of Elijah, and a lively type was Elijah, as well as Moſes, of theſe two prophets. While Jezebel, the type of the Romiſh mother of harlo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, was promoting idolatry and killing the ſaints, Elijah's word ſhut up heaven. 'As the Lord God of Iſrael liveth,' he ſays, 'before whom I ſtand, there ſhall not be rain nor dew theſe years but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032007_0014_0FF09E9B6DF4B988"/>to my word.' 'Theſe years;' what years? Three years and an half. Our Lord tells us, Luke iv. 25. that 'In the days of Elias the heaven was ſhut up three years and ſix months, and great famine was throughout all the land:' And the apoſtle James ſays, that 'Elias prayed earneſtly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the ſpace of three years and ſix months.' This ſpace of time is taken great notice of in ſcripture prophecy. Three years and ſix months are juſt the ſame as one thouſand two hundred and ſixty days, and juſt the ſame as forty-two months, and juſt the ſame as a time, times and an half: for a time is a year, times are two years, and half a time is half a year. The ſame is expreſſed by a time, times, and the dividing of time. That is, three years and an half, which are half ſeven. Seven is the number of perfection, half ſever is half perfection, which is utter imperfection: and as God has meaſured the duration of his own perfect works by the number ſeven, ſo he has ſeen fit to meaſure the duration of theſe imperfect and wicked works of men with their ſad conſequences by juſt half this number. And as Elijah by his word ſhut up heaven and cauſed a great famine in Iſrael for three years and an half; ſo the two witneſſes by the word of their prophecy have ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhut up heaven, and cauſed a great famine upon the Chriſtian world, for three prophet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical years and an half. And as in the time
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032007_0015_0FF09E6946892050"/>of famine in Iſrael the prophet Elijah fed the woman of Sarepta with oil; ſo theſe two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in the time of Popiſh famine have fed the woman in the wilderneſs with ſpiritual oil, that ſhe through faith and comfort of the ſcriptures might have hope. She had 'a place prepared her of God, where <hi>they</hi> ſhould feed her;' that is, where theſe two prophets ſhould 'feed her a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore days.'</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, that not a literal, but a ſpiritual famine was inflicted upon the earth by theſe two prophets in the days of Popery; in conſequence of which the waters were turned into blood. To explain which we muſt conſider what thoſe bleſſings are, which are in the ſame manner uſeful to our ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual life as waters are to our natural life.</p>
            <p>As there are rivers in the world, the ſtreams of which delight and refreſh the body; ſo 'there is a river, the ſtreams of which make glad the city of God.' In the latter flow the waters mentioned in the text: and theſe waters muſt ſignify, either the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joys and graces of the true Chriſtian, or the external ordinances and means of grace; but they cannot ſignify the former, they cannot ſignify the inward joys and graces of the true Chriſtian: for theſe, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſouls they reſide, are never turned into blood; but are in them, a well of water ſpringing up unto everlaſting life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the waters of the text can ſignify noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032007_0016_0FF09E9DF2CB1CE0"/>elſe but the outward ordinances and means of grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But how were theſe turned into blood?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what the ſad effect was, when Moſes in Egypt turned the waters into blood, to which this paſſage undoubtedly alludes. By this change, the waters of Egypt were rendered not only uſeleſs, but exceedingly injurious, and tended rather to aggravate their thirſt than aſſuage it. So that flood of errors and ſuperſtition into which the true doctrines and ordinances of the goſpel were changed in the days of Popery and by the word of prophecy, was not only uſeleſs, but exceedingly injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the ſouls of men. As good water is very neceſſary and comfortable to the body, but when turned to blood, becomes exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly hurtful to the body; ſo the true doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and ordinances of the goſpel are very neceſſary and comfortable to the ſoul; but, when turned to ſuperſtition and lies, become exceedingly hurtful to the ſoul. Among the Heathen and among the Papiſts, the truth of God was changed into a lie; and what was the conſequence? 'They worſhipped and ſerved the creature more than the Creator, who is over all, God bleſſed forever.' By this time it is eaſy to ſee how naturally the change of waters into blood repreſents the change of truth into a lie, and of genuine doctrines into vile ſuperſtitions: And that this plague was inflicted by the two witneſſes, appears from Iſa. lxvi. 4, and from 2 Theſſ.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032007_0017_0FF09E6C2CF03620"/>ii. 8; 'I alſo will chooſe their deluſions.' 'And then ſhall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord ſhall conſume by the ſpirit of his mouth, and deſtroy by the brightneſs of his coming: even him whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power and ſigns and lying wonders, and with all deceivable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth: and for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould believe a lie; that they all may be damned who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not the truth, but have pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.' But</p>
            <p n="3">III. What is meant by their ſmiting the earth as often as they will?</p>
            <p>This may ſignify the eſtabliſhed and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible connexion between the voice of proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecy and the event. It was a marvellous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of power given to the prophet Elijah, when he only ſpake the word and down came the fire from heaven and devoured his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. A lively and ſolemn apprehenſion of this had the third captain with his fifty, when he fell upon his knees and begged for mercy. He was apprehenſive that the prophet could, if he would, utterly conſume him with all his armed fifty, and his apprehenſion was juſt: for the will of that prophet, under divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, was the will of God. The ſame power and will have the two prophets now
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032007_0018_0FF09EA0222B2588"/>treated of. But how unnatural is it to rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſent the two Teſtaments as having exerciſes of will, ſays the objector. But why more unnatural than to repreſent them as ſpeaking and hearing a voice, as the ſcripture itſelf does? Yet the latter is no more true or nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural, when viewed in a literal ſenſe, than the former, but in figurative language how eaſy is the tranſition from an intelligent voice to a will dictating that voice. Therefore, as the language of ſcripture may be properly called the voice of the ſcripture, ſo the ſenſe of that language may be properly called the will of the ſcripture, being God's will and the will of all the inſpired prophets. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meaning of the laſt clauſe of the text ſeems to be, that whatever plagues the two Teſtaments denounce ſhall certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly come to paſs. The word of the Lord endureth forever: heaven and earth ſhall paſs away before one jot or tittle of it ſhall fail. The will of theſe two witneſſes is the will of God: therefore, whatever threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they denounce againſt the finally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſhall ſurely be accompliſhed. Their word has alreadly deſtroyed a multitude of ſinners; it has brought a deluge upon the old world, fire on Sodom, blood and famine on Jeruſalem, and utter ruin on Babylon; and the ſame voice of theſe prophets has ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the Jews over the earth: and ſo, where-ever theſe two prophets ſpeak againſt their enemies, they ſmite; every threatening is
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032007_0019_0FF09E6DBA979E58"/>a blow, every word a wound. The everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mountains ſhall be ſcattered, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual hills ſhall bow; but forever, O Lord, thy word is ſettled in heaven.</p>
            <p>A few inferences ſhall cloſe the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is the power and authority of theſe witneſſes ſo very great in the world? How dangerous then the condition of all thoſe who deſpiſe and ridicule them, and call in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their veracity! Many ſuch bold objects of Chriſtian compaſſion may now be obſerved in the world. As Jannes and Jambres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Moſes by endeavouring to repreſent him as an impoſtor, ſo do theſe men alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the truth by endeavouring to repreſent as impoſtors theſe two anointed ones, which ſtand before the God of the earth. But they ſhall proceed no further than the bounds allotted them by theſe very prophets, whom they deſpiſe, and whoſe never-failing predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aſſure us, that there muſt come mockers to grieve the godly in the laſt times. Like Jannes and Jambres ere long their mouths will be ſtopped, and their folly will be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt unto all men, as theirs alſo was. How ſwiftly the day approaches which ſhall burn as an oven, and all theſe proud, goſpelized infidels ſhall be as ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch! For, obſerve the context, 'If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouths and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their enemies; and if any man will hurt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032007_0020_0FF09EA2812E2790"/>them, he muſt in this manner be killed.'<note n="*" place="bottom">Here is another evident alluſion to the prophet Elijah; fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uratively ſpeaking, fire proceeded out of his mouth when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the two captains and their fifties.</note> The threatening is repeated, as Pharaoh's dream was, to ſhew, perhaps, that the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecy is certain, and the plague foretold is ſure.</p>
            <p>And what is this plague? what is this fire? It is the fire which ſhall burn the world, the fire of hell; the fire which ſhall burn the beaſt and the falſe prophet.</p>
            <p>If any man will hurt them, i. e. if any man ſhall take away part from the prophecy of this book,—and much more, if he take away all, 'God will take away his part out of the book of life;' 'and whoſoever was not found written in the book of life, was caſt into the lake of fire.' This is the fire which proceedeth out of their mouths: for it is the mouth of the ſcripture which denounceth that fire,<note n="†" place="bottom">I will make my words in thy mouth fire, ſaith the Lord to the prophet, Jeremiah, chap. v. 14. The voice of all the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> againſt the wicked is fire proceeding out of their mouths.</note> which ſhall burn the ungodly forever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How terrible is the condition of all thoſe who ſuffer thoſe ſpiritual plagues, with which theſe prophets ſmite the earth: ſpiritual fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine, ſpiritual barrenneſs and mortality of ſoul under the means of grace! What greater curſe than the ſig-tree curſed! 'Let no man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever.' They have eyes and eye-ſight, ears and hearing, and yet they neither ſee nor hear; they grope at noon-day as in the night, and ſtagger with their eyes open like a drunken man. Let
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032007_0021_0FF09E702D4B8908"/>our ſpeculative knowledge be ever ſo great, if ſin be indulged, the moſt perilous blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs remains. It is the very nature of ſin to darken the mind and hold a falſe picture of things continually before our eyes. Hence follows ſpeculative darkneſs with reſpect to moral things. The righteous providence of God often gives men over to a bad faith as the puniſhment of a bad heart. Such was the puniſhment of the ancient heathen: 'Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that when they knew God,' ſays Paul, 'they glorified him not as God; and did not like to retain him in their knowledge; he gave them up to uncleanneſs, to vile affections, to a reprobate mind; who changed the truth of God into a lie.' Such was the puniſhment of the Jews, cut off for unbelief: The vail is yet on their hearts, while Moſes is read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Such was the puniſhment of the Chriſtians after the pure and glorious goſpel had ſhone before them; heaven was ſhut up over them, as already ſhewn, and their waters turned into blood; and I think the ſcripture tells us,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xvi. 13, 14.</note> that the Chriſtian world ſhall be ſmitten once more with ſpiritual plagues, with ſtrong deluſion, infidelity and falſe religion. And if ſo, though the preſent age is very corrupt, the next will, doubtleſs, be more ſo, both in principle and practice: for the day of the Lord is at hand, and upon the wicked God ſhall rain ſnares, and then fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:032007_0022_0FF09EA457E04630"/>
The Chriſtian world are now more guilty than were the ancient Chriſtians, Jews, or Heathen. Far more abundant is the light againſt which we rebel. Doubtleſs the moſt fatal and general deluſion is at hand; yea, has not the plague already begun? What oppoſition, what ridicule do we hear againſt the witneſſes and their ſolemn threatenings! What a plague of plagues is that which is ſpiritual and eternal! How perilous then is the condition of every unregenerate ſinner at this day! How liable to be ſmitten by theſe modern plagues of deluſion, which begin now to be ſo epidemical! O ſinner! now is the accepted time. This moment fly to Chriſt and receive the love of the truth, leſt that holy God who is now angry with you every day, ſhould chooſe your deluſion, and ſmite you with ſome modern plague, which ſhall be incurable and eternal. Fear not the croſs; fear not ſelf-denial; rich are the joys which accompany you even in this life: But in the future life, O how rich! Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them who love him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What cauſe of gratitude have we, that theſe two anointed ones have ever ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord of the whole earth, amidſt all the oppoſition of earth and hell. 'My vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard' (my church) ſays Chriſt, 'which is mine, is before me,' ever watching for her preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So theſe two witneſſes are before him
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032007_0023_0FF09E7276B87BE0"/>for the church's ſake. The Keeper of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el keeps the two great lights of Iſrael. They torment them who dwell on the earth, and therefore their enemies have been many and mighty. The Hebrew copies of the Old Teſtament were almoſt entirely deſtroyed in the reign of the Emperor Diocleſian, but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means were found for its preſervation. And what the Papiſts have done, has already been obſerved. Yet the witneſſes are ſtill alive, they have riſen and aſcended, and their enemies have beheld them with grief and diſappointment. The Popiſh famine, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is nearly ended. What ſaid Elijah when the famine in Iſrael was nearly ended? Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is the ſound of abundance of rain. Such is the ſound of the ſeventh trumpet now at hand; a day moſt dreadful to the wicked, and moſt delightful to the righteous. See! ſee! how it approaches with haſty ſteps! What ſteps? Revolutions, Oh how wonderful! in Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica and Europe. Sit on the ground, for there is not a throne, O daughter of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; thy plagues are come in one day. Death and mourning and famine, and the voice of harps and muſicians and pipers and trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall be heard no more at all in thee; and the light of a candle ſhall ſhine no more at all in thee; and no craftſman, of whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever craft he be, ſhall be found any more at all in thee. And the voice of the bridegroom
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032007_0024_0FF09E7FEA32FA80"/>and the voice of the bride, ſhall be heard no more at all in thee.</p>
            <p>Awake and ſing, thou who dwelleſt in duſt, O perſecuted Zion! Shine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee. Shine by diligence in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good word and work; let every word be praiſe, every action love, every thought ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual and divine: With this beauteous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel make thyſelf ready, O bride of the Lamb! For even now thy God is on his way, and all the ſaints with him. Amen; even ſo, come, Lord Jeſus.</p>

               <p>THE works of God are a perfect beauty: Light and ſhade, angel and devil; all are neceſſary to conſtitute this perfection. All his works praiſe him: the wrath of man and the rage of elements: every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is thus engaged in heaven and earth and under the earth and in the ſea. As for God, his way of providence is perfect. He is wonderful in counſel and excellent in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nothing is made,—nothing is done in vain through all the immenſity of ſpace and duration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All beauty is conſtituted by harmony or ſimilarity in variety; ſuch is the beauty of the natural world. It is full of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, full of imitations amidſt infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety.</p>

3. The natural world reſembles the ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual world; otherwiſe there could be no ſuch thing as metaphor, type, allegory, or any compariſon between matter and mind.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the works of providence are not leſs beautiful than the works of creation, ſo they are not leſs conſpicuous for ſimilarity in variety. The annual revolutions, varied in reſpects innumerable, all have their days and nights, ſummer and winter, ſeed-time and harveſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame conſtitutes the beauty of ages; one order of events in one age of the world is a lively picture of another order of events in another age of the world. Hence the propriety of many types in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of perſons and things, cities, nations and countries. Hence alſo appears the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſo many prophecies in ſcripture have ſeveral aſpects to ſeveral different periods of time, as ever has been allowed by the moſt learned expoſitors.</p>
               <p>A ſingle ſentence in prophecy predicts an event or period of events, with all its types and antitypes. Canaan was an image of the goſpel reſt, and the goſpel reſt is an image of the Millennium, and the Millennium will be an image of heaven. Therefore the promiſe of Canaan to Abraham was a promiſe and proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecy of all theſe Canaans and all theſe periods of duration. And it is manifeſt that the prophecies, in general, of the Old Teſtament which predict the Chriſtian diſpenſation, do
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:032007_0027_0FF09E76734F3930"/>in the ſame language, the ſame ſentences pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the Millennium, having an aſpect to both theſe happy periods. 'The thing which hath been, it is that which ſhall be, and that which is done, is that which ſhall be done, and there is no new thing under the ſun.'</p>
               <p n="5">5. Gods, in his infinite love and mercy, has ſent us, for inſtruction, a preſent from heaven, a map of his works, paſt, preſent, and to come. Bleſſed are thoſe eyes which can properly ſurvey it, and thoſe humble hearts which can be thankful for it! On a map of the globe, cities, mountains, lakes and rivers in all countries, are diſtinguiſhed by ſimilar notations. By obſerving then in what manner any known country is deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, we may underſtand too the geography of others which are unknown: So on this map of ages, by properly obſerving the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineation of any order of events already known to us, we are the better prepared to judge of the like order of events which are yet future.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Small maps of the globe give only ſome general ideas of its various regions: So the map before us, though perfectly accurate, is very ſmall, and affords but a general idea of the ſtupendous and glorious events which ſhall be accompliſhed hereafter.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. THE PLAN OF THE SUBJECT PROPOSED AND EXPLAINED.</head>
               <p>A COMPENDIOUS map of the globe preſents only principal objects, while the innumerable ſmaller are underſtood to be in connexion with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Bible, the moſt excellent of books, continually preſents to our view the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent of God's works, that of Redemption, while it teaches, that all other works are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This work of redemption is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate with time, and will not be finiſhed till Chriſt delivers up the kingdom to the Father. It is he who carries on this moſt glorious work in his triple capacity of Prophet, Prieſt and King.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Accordingly, the Bible has diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the order of the work of redemption by three general diſpenſations of grace, which ſeem to be reſponſive to theſe three offices. The firſt diſpenſation was peculiarly prophet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical; all the types were ſo many prophecies, and the prophecies of the New Teſtament are little more than the expoſition of thoſe which are found in the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d.</p>
               <p>The ſecond diſpenſation is peculiar for the exhibition of Chriſt's prieſtly character, not only in his own perſon, but in his people:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032007_0029_0FF09E78609654B8"/>Every martyr is a prieſt, and every martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom a ſacrifice, by Phil. ii. 17; and the martyrdoms, under our diſpenſation, are more numerous than thoſe under the old by a thouſand to one. Chriſt introduced our diſpenſation by the voluntary ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſtill continues to diſtinguiſh it from the old by his work of interceſſion.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, the third diſpenſation will be peculiar for the exhibition of Chriſt's kingly character, not only in his own perſon, but in his people, as appears by Rev. v. 10, xx. 4. 'And haſt made as unto our God kings and prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the earth.— They lived and reigned with Chriſt a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years.'</p>
               <p n="5">5. The firſt diſpenſation was an image of the ſecond, as appears from all the types of the Old Teſtament: The firſt had a Babylon and a vile perſon to afflict the church; and ſo has the ſecond. In like manner the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond is an image of the third, as appears in that, by the conceſſion of the beſt commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the moſt important events of both are predicted by the ſame ſentences of prophecy.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The three diſpenſations muſt have three revelations or witneſſes; the Old Teſtament, the New Teſtament, and the more immediate teaching of Chriſt himſelf. The preſent rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elation explains the old, and the third will explain both. And will not Chriſt then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as the Logos far more gloriouſly than ever he did before? It does in a meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032007_0030_0FF09E7A6CCC5688"/>appear by Rev. xi. 6, that Moſes and Elijah, two eminent prophets, are uſed by the Holy Ghoſt as types of our two Teſtaments. Moſes turned the waters into bloody, and Elijah ſhut up heaven. The Old Teſtament worſhip ſeems to have been a rod in the hand of him who choſe their deluſions to turn the waters of the Chriſtian world into blood, as already explained in the preceding ſermon. Popery in part is the miſimprovement of Old Teſtament worſhip. Elijah cured the people of idolatry; and for this purpoſe the New Teſtament rather than the Old is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably calculated. Hence, perhaps, it was, that when the three diſciples beheld on the mount the repreſentation of Chriſt's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture glory; the truth of which the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unitedly confirm, Moſes and Elias, rather than other prophets, appeared in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious converſe with Jeſus.<note n="*" place="bottom">Peter, relating what he ſaw on the holy mount, ſays, <hi>(hai echomen beb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The words which Daniel heard, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not, (Dan. xii. 8, 9) were cloſed up and ſealed till the time of the end, and then this ſealed book was opened to John, by a new revelation from heaven. But when John had a ſimilar viſion, he had ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. 'Seal up thoſe things which the ſeven thunders uttered, and write them not:' We muſt therefore expect a new revelation to explain what the ſeven thunders uttered. As the ſealed words which Daniel heard
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032007_0031_0FF09E7BFA7D30B8"/>were not explained but by a new revelation; ſo we have no reaſon to expect that the ſealed voices of the ſeven thunders will be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by a new diſpenſation and a new rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elation from heaven.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Each diſpenſation muſt conclude by a day of judgment, ſevering the wicked from the juſt. Thus ended the firſt diſpenſation; the Jewiſh nation were deſtroyed, while the Chriſtians, by believing and obeying Chriſt's word, all marvellouſly eſcaped, a Dr. New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton tells us out of ſeveral hiſtorians.<note n="*" place="bottom">We do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

To both theſe days of judgment the prophecy of our Saviour refers, in the xxivth. of Matthew, and xxiſt of Luke, which ſhews that the former repreſented the latter. The end of the next diſpenſation will be the univerſal judgment, when all ſin will be ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from holineſs, and all the wicked from the juſt, to aſſociate no more forever; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not written in the book of life ſhall then be caſt into the lake of fire.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Accordingly there muſt be three reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrections. At the end of the laſt diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was a reſurrection of Chriſt and many of the ſaints. At the end of the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, there will be a reſurrection of many
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032007_0032_0FF09EA988775BC0"/>more ſaints. And at the end of the next, there will be an univerſal reſurrection of the righteous and the wicked.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe reſurrections gave death a wound; the ſecond will give this enemy a deeper wound, and the third will utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him. 'For as in Adam all die,' ſays Paul, 'ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. But every man in his own order, Chriſt the firſt fruits, afterward they who are Chriſt's at his coming.

               <p n="9">9. So alſo there muſt be three conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The firſt deſtroyed Jeruſalem and the temple; the ſecond will deſtroy the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven in flaming fire; the third will deſtroy the laſt Gog and Magog. They compaſſed the camp of the ſaints—and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.</p>
               <p>To all theſe three periods that may refer in Mal. iv. 1. 'Behold, the day cometh that ſhall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, all they that do wickedly, ſhall be as ſtubble: and the day that cometh ſhall burn
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032007_0033_0FF09E7E0BBBEBE8"/>them up, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.'</p>
               <p n="10">10. As there are no more than three offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt revealed in his word; ſo, by Art. 4th, we are not to expect more than three diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>It will not be denied that the Millennium, or third diſpenſation, will, if poſſible, as much excel the preſent for the extenſiveneſs of its bleſſings, as the preſent excels the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and if ſo, it is certain that all the globe 'will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the ſea:' and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the third day of judgment muſt be the day of univerſal judgment, and the ſtate of all mankind muſt then be ſuch as cannot admit of another antitype or fourth diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p>Three diſpenſations afford a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for that in Matt. xiii. 33. 'The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in <hi>three</hi> meaſures of meal, till the whole was leavened.' Jehovah himſelf is Trinity in unity, and his works are what they are, becauſe He is what He is. The work of mediation is a divine, moſt glorious and perfect work: and "in every divine, complete work," ſays the famous Swedenborg, "there is a <hi>Trine,</hi> which is called firſt, middle and laſt. From this ground it is, that by <hi>three</hi> in the ſpiritual ſenſe of the word is meant what is complete and perfect. And whereas this is the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032007_0034_0FF09EAC79237100"/>of that number, therefore it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently applied in the Word, when that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification is intended to be expreſſed, as in the following paſſages, where it is written 'that Iſaiah ſhould go naked and barefoot <hi>three years.</hi>' Iſa. xx. 3. 'That Jehovah called Samuel <hi>three times,</hi> and Samuel ran <hi>three times</hi> to Eli, and Eli underſtood him the <hi>third</hi> time.' 1 Sam. iii. 1—8. 'That Elijah ſtretched himſelf on the widow's ſon <hi>three times.</hi>' 1 Kings xvii. 21. And 'commanded to pour water on the burnt offering <hi>three times.</hi>' 1 Kings xviii. 34. 'That Jonah was in the whale's belly <hi>three days</hi> and <hi>three nights.</hi>' Jonah ii. 1. 'That Jeſus roſe the <hi>third</hi> day.' Matt. xxviii. 1. Not to mention many other paſſages, where the number <hi>three</hi> is named, being applied to denote a finiſhed and perfect work."<note n="*" place="bottom">Swedenborg's Doctrine of the New Jeruſalem, p. 37, 38.</note> It cannot be impertinent likewiſe to obſerve, that the next diſpenſation is the ſeventh mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennary: So that in the concluſion of that day both theſe numbers of perfection will harmonize, and render the work of media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a finiſhed and perfect work.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. THE MILLENNIUM A NEW GENERAL DIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENSATION OF GRACE.</head>
               <p>THE poſitive inſtitutions, which the Old Teſtament church received in different peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, may perhaps be called particular diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, in diſtinction from the whole of them included in the Moſaic economy. For they were all of one general nature; all were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and typical, all were a ſhadow of good things to come; and in thoſe ages no inſtitution was aboliſhed, when a new one was introduced. Therefore all the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament economy was one general diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace. The preſent ſtate of the church is allowed to be another general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, clearly diſtinct from the former. It is now to be conſidered, whether there will not be a new diſpenſation; <hi>a new order of things,</hi> with reſpect to the church and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as clearly diſtinct from the preſent as the preſent is from that of the Jews.</p>
               <p>Under the old diſpenſation, the Jews had a Millennium in proſpect as well as we. They were in conſtant expectation of a glorious time, in which holineſs and happineſs ſhould be general, if not univerſal; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that glorious time only as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of their own diſpenſation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the nations would embrace their
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032007_0036_0FF09EAE0E62DC80"/>religion and their kind of government; that all fleſh would worſhip at their temple, from one <hi>new moon</hi> to another, and from one <hi>ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enth day</hi> Sabbath to another. They expected as a nation to have a portion in this promiſed glory with the reſt of mankind. And in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral it appears, that both the righteous and the wicked among them had the ſame lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentiments on this ſubject. The nature of our diſpenſation was doubtleſs as well known to the Apoſtles when Chriſt aroſe as to any of the pious Jews; and yet they aſk, 'Lord, wilt thou at this time reſtore again the kingdom to Iſrael?' Of the like nature are the views and expectations of Chriſtians in general at this day. <hi>The Millennium is at hand,</hi> ſay we, <hi>to make our poſterity happy, and all nations happy, under the imperfect govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mere men, by their embracing the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals as well as the internals of our religion; the Millennium will be a glorious continuance of our own diſpenſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, ſince theſe our expectations ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſemble thoſe of the Jews, it is certainly a matter of importance to inquire whether they have any better foundation in the word of prophecy. It is from the ſame Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament prophecy that both Jews and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have formed theſe ſimilar ideas of their two Millenniums. And how plainly do theſe prophecies declare, that the promiſed glory ſhall be introduced by a day of judgment; 'A day which ſhall burn as an oven;' by a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032007_0037_0FF09E8237780ED8"/>reſurrection, and by the coming of Chriſt to take vengeance on his enemies<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. lxvi. 15—20. Mal. iv. 1. Iſa. xxv. 8. and xxvi. 19, and ſeveral other paſſages.</note> who ſhall have rebelled againſt the light. Theſe and ſimilar paſſages, we ſay, are figurative; but may not a Chriſtian as effectually deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a conſtruction of prophecy too figur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative, as a Jew by a conſtruction too literal?</p>
               <p>Now, if it can be proved that there will be imperfect holineſs and death among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the Millennium; that the Sun of righteouſneſs will perſonally appear in the morning of that day; that there will then be a partial conflagration and a reſurrection; the inference is neceſſary, that there will be a new diſpenſation or order of things with reſpect to the church, as diſtinct from the preſent as the preſent is from that of the Jews. Therefore, to obtain evidence of theſe prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitions muſt be the attempt of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſections.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">

                     <hi>SECTION I.</hi> There will be a State of Imperfection among Mankind in the Millennium.</head>
                  <p>THOUGH the prophecy of the new heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and earth ſeems to have ultimate refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the perfect ſtate of glory; yet, by the general conſent of expoſitors, it includes
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032007_0038_0FF09EAFA2504570"/>the Millennium, that brighteſt image or the heavenly ſtate, which will ever exiſt in the world. As the works of creation from one day to another were more and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and proceeded from inferior to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior exhibitions of God's character; ſo do the works of providence, and particularly thoſe of redemption. As the preſent ſtate of the church far exceeds that of the Jews; ſo the millennial ſtate will far exceed the preſent, and form the nexus between earth and heaven, as ſoon may appear more clearly.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill there will be imperfect ſaints in that time, and multitudes of bold tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors at the concluſion of that time: For,</p>

And Rev. xxii. 2, that 'the leaves of the tree (of life) were for the <hi>healing</hi> of the nations.' This ſentence is not hiſtory, but prophecy, and therefore we explain it moſt naturally when we conſider it as referring, not to that which ſhall then be paſt, but to that which ſhall exiſt in the time here predicted.

                     <hi>SECTION II.</hi> The Millennium introduced by Chriſt's perſonal Appearance.</head>
                  <p>IT was the ancient opinion, that the whole thouſand years will be the day of judgment; in the morning whereof ſhall be the coming of Chriſt in flaming fire, and the particular judgment of antichriſt; and in the evening whereof ſhall be the univerſal judgment. In the Millennium, Chriſt 'will <hi>judge</hi> among the nations, and rebuke many people.' 'He ſhall judge the living as well as the dead at his appearing and kingdom.' 2 Tim. iv. 1. So that the whole Millennium may be properly termed <hi>the day</hi> of judgment, and perhaps thouſands of years ſucceeding it.</p>
                  <p>Now the inquiry is, Whether Chriſt will not perſonally appear when this great day of judgment ſhall commence? For the ſolution of which the following arguments are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the contemplation of the candid and deliberate Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If this ſolemn appearance is to be at the concluſion of the Millennium, it would be
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032007_0041_0FF09E872A424490"/>natural to expect that ſome prophecy of that happy time would conclude by ſome plain and particular deſcription of Chriſt as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from heaven in the clouds, or in ſome other manner: For the ſeries of a particular prophecy is ordinarily parallel with that of its accompliſhment; but we no where find, either in the Old Teſtament or New, any ſuch deſcription at the concluſion of ſuch a prophecy. The account of the Millennium in Rev. xxth. though conciſe is very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: And firſt, an angel comes down from heaven 'having the key of the bottomleſs pit.' "This angel is Chriſt," ſays Dr. More: "it is he who has the key of the bottomleſs pit; it is he who has the keys of hell and of death." At the concluſion of this chapter, Chriſt appears on a throne; but there is no mention of his coming from heaven in any manner whatever.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe prophecies of the Old Teſtament, which moſt clearly predict the coming of Chriſt, and the Millennium, plainly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the former, not as that which ſhall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, but as that which ſhall introduce the latter. The deſcription of the new heavens and earth, Iſa. lxvth. and lxvith. chapters, is conſidered by the beſt commentators as a prophecy of our goſpel glory and that of the Millennium, and the former as the figure of the latter. And in chap. lxvi. 14—17, how plainly it appears, that the future glory is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the coming of the Lord with fire,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032007_0042_0FF09EB290DF32D8"/>and with his chariots or clouds ('for he maketh the clouds his chariots.' Pſa. civ. 3) 'to render his anger with fury, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke with flames of fire.' Now, ſince it is allowed that our goſpel glory typifies the Millennium, and that the deſtruction of the Jewiſh world typifies the deſtruction of the Chriſtian world; with equal propriety may we conſider the firſt coming of Chriſt as a type or repreſentation of his ſecond coming. His firſt coming was with a 'fan in his hand thoroughly to purge his floor, and gather his wheat into his garner, and to burn the chaff with fire unquenchable.' Matt. iii. 12. And ſuch will be the buſineſs of his ſecond coming. Here then is a ſolemn and glorious prediction with a double aſpect; to the firſt coming of Chriſt to deſtroy the Jewiſh world and introduce our diſpenſation; and to the ſecond coming of Chriſt to deſtroy the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world and introduce the Millennium, the former being a type of the latter. We have ſeen in what order the type has been fulfilled: What doubt then can remain of the completion of the antitype in the ſame order?</p>
                  <p>So in Zech. xiv. we have a clear prophecy of the Millennium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s introduced by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, verſe 5. 'The Lord my God ſhall come, and all the ſaints with thee.' Whenever the ſcripture elſewhere mentions Chriſt's coming with his ſaints, it is ever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſignify his perſonal coming: Here
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032007_0043_0FF09E899F9D2F78"/>then the ſame phraſe, other things being equal, ſhould have the ſame acceptation. Beſides, it is a maxim with divines, that the literal ſenſe of ſcripture ſhould always be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a ſenſe merely figurative, when it does not oppoſe the analogy of faith. Other ſuch prophecies there are, which, for brevity's ſake, are omitted; but which the reader may examine as opportunity may occur.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is holden by all expoſitors, that the ſeventh vial will introduce the Millennium. The ſixth vial gives warning of that coming of Chriſt, which ſhall be as a thief, and which ſhall put the unwatchful to ſhame, Rev. xvi. 15. 'Behold, I come as a thief; bleſſed is he who watcheth and keepeth his garments, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame.' Whenever the ſcripture elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where mentions Chriſt's coming as a thief, it always means his perſonal coming. Now, if Chriſt will not perſonally appear till the concluſion of the thouſand years, no reaſon can he aſſigned why this ſolemn warning ſhould be fixed under the ſixth vial rather than under the ſeventh; but if Chriſt ſhould appear in the morning of that day, the warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can be no where ſo properly fixed as where we find it. q. d. <hi>One more vial, and then I come. Now if ever, O Chriſtians, watch and keep your garments, leſt you walk naked, and they ſee your ſhame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. At the marriage of the Lamb, Rev. xix. 7, all agree, the Millennium will commence.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032007_0044_0FF09EB6376F96E0"/>But in Matt. xxv. 6, the repreſentation is, that when Chriſt ſhall come as a bridegroom, he will come perſonally. A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> accordingly there is great preparation for this wedding. The bride makes herſelf ready with excellent attire, 'fine linen, clean and white,' Rev. xix. 8, "fit for the entertainment of ſo great a King, who comes as an huſband to dwell with his wife. This is the ſcope of the forty-fifth pſalm: Solomon's marriage was but a type of this."<note n="*" place="bottom">See the pamphlet of Mr. Cheevers on this ſubject.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Thoſe ſcriptures which repreſent the millennial ſtate as the <hi>kingdom</hi> of Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it in ſuch a manner as affords clear ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence that the world will then be favoured with Chriſt's perſonal preſence. This is David's kingdom, ſo frequently predicted by the prophets; by Jer. xxxiii. 15, 'I will raiſe unto David a righteous Branch, and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgment and juſtice in the earth;' and by Ezek. xxxiv. 23, 24, and xxxvii. 24, 'David my ſervant ſhall be king over them (my people.) A prince over them, and a prince <hi>among</hi> them.' Such is the deſcription of Chriſt's future kingdom in Zech. xiv. 9, compared with verſe 5th, and in Dan. vii. and 2 Tim. iv. 1. And the time when the kingdoms of this world ſhall become the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of our Lord, Rev. xi. 15, 18, will be the time when the dead ſhall be judged, and Chriſt will deſtroy them who deſtroy the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032007_0045_0FF09E8B28301218"/>earth. And that this judgment and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will take place at the <hi>beginning</hi> of that time, appears from Rev. x. 5, 6, 7.<note n="*" place="bottom">For then Daniel will ſtand in his lot after reſting in the grave. See the 3d inference of this ſection, and argument 5th of ſection 4th. 'The Lord will come with all his ſaints.'</note> This kingdom of Chriſt will be the New Jeruſalem ſtate, of which, when John had a viſion, he heard a great voice out of heaven, ſaying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men!' Rev. xxi. 3. <hi>Behold,</hi> is an interjection of wonder. The ancient tabernacle was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly a type of Chriſt's body. 'The Word was made fleſh, and <hi>(eſkeenooſen)</hi> taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled among us.' John i. 14. Behold a wondrous event! The bodily preſence of Chriſt is with men, 'and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God <hi>himſelf</hi> ſhall be with them and be their God.' Therefore the name of New-Jeruſalem 'from that day ſhall be <hi>Jehovah Shammah,</hi> The Lord is there.' Ezek. xlviii. 35.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Is not <hi>the waiting</hi> of the ſaints for the Millennium, ſo often mentioned in the Old Teſtament, the ſame as their <hi>waiting</hi> for Chriſt's coming, ſo often mentioned in the New? 'It ſhall be ſaid in that day, (the Millennium) 'Lo, this is our God! we have <hi>waited</hi> for him.' Iſa. xxv. 9. In Zeph. iii. 8, which is allowed to predict the Millennium, we are commanded to <hi>wait</hi> for it. 'There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>wait</hi> ye upon me, ſaith the Lord, until the day that I riſe up to the prey,' &amp;c. And in Dan. xii. 12, he is pronounced bleſſed who

                     <hi>waiteth</hi> and cometh to the one thouſand three hundred and thirty-five days. For this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious time, the ſaints for ages have waited and are ſtill waiting. What time? The New Teſtament, which is the expoſitor of the Old, mentions no time thus waited for on this ſide of Chriſt's coming; but it mentions our '<hi>looking for</hi> and haſtening unto the coming of the day of God.' 2 Pet. iii. 12. It men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a day when 'to thoſe who <hi>look for</hi> him, (Chriſt) he ſhall appear the ſecond time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin unto ſalvation.' Heb. ix. 28. Of a time when Chriſtians, ſerving the living and true God, <hi>waited 'for his Son from heaven.'</hi> 1 Theſſ. i. 10. And when the ſaints groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within themſelves <hi>waited</hi> 'for the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even the redemption of their body.' Rom. viii. 23.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When our Lord undertook to ſatisfy his diſciples concerning <hi>the time</hi> of his ſecond coming, he mentions the moſt remarkable preceding events; that the goſpel ſhould be preached to <hi>all</hi> nations for a witneſs,<note n="*" place="bottom">It is not neceſſary to underſtand the word <hi>all</hi> here as without limitation. It is well known that the phraſes <hi>all the world, the whole earth,</hi> and <hi>all nations,</hi> frequently ſignify only a very great part of the world, and of the nations. Dr. Newton ſays, that this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was accompliſhed before the deſtruction of Jeruſalem; if it was, certainly this word <hi>all</hi> has a limited ſenſe. The ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is again accompliſhed in <hi>our</hi> laſt days by the Proteſtant refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which is alſo foretold in Rev. xiv. 6, as ſome explain it, and repreſented by 'the angel flying through the midſt of heaven, having the everlaſting goſpel to preach to them who dwell on the earth, and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people.' It is generally allowed that this event precedes the Millennium, and therefore we muſt neceſſarily underſtand the phraſe, <hi>'every nation and kindred,'</hi> &amp;c. in a limited ſenſe. In verſe 8th, <hi>all</hi> nations are ſaid to drink of the wine of Babylon's fornication; but the South Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He indeed mentions the Millennium; but he plainly ſpeaks of it as the conſequence of his coming. Luke xxi. 29, 30, 31. 'Behold the fig-tree and all the trees! when they now ſhoot forth, ye ſee that ſummer is now nigh at hand: ſo likewiſe ye, when ye ſee theſe things come to paſs, know ye that <hi>the kingdom of God</hi> is nigh at hand.' Compare this with 2 Tim. iv. 1. When ſome thought that the kingdom of God ſhould immediately appear, Luke xix. 11, Chriſt rectifies their opinion by a parable. A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himſelf <hi>a kingdom,</hi> and to <hi>return.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. The apoſtles, Peter and Jude, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically deſcribing the apoſtaſy and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Chriſtian world, 2 Pet. ii. and iii. plainly repreſent that God will put an end to it; not by the general reformation of this ſort of ſinners, but by an overthrow, like that of Sodom and Gomorrah. Peter firſt deſcribes their character and then their ruin. And Jude ſays, verſe 14, 15, that 'Enoch, the ſeventh from Adam, propheſied of theſe, (wandering ſtars) ſaying, 'Behold the Lord cometh with ten thouſand of his ſaints, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute judgment upon all, and to convince all ungodly men of all their ungodly deeds, and of all the hard ſpeeches which ungodly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the faints is mentioned in verſe 13; 'I ſaw in the night viſions, and, behold, one <hi>like</hi> the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him.'</p>
                  <p>Some have ſuppoſed that this Ancient of Days is God the Father, and conſequently that the 13th verſe predicts Chriſt's aſcenſion to him; but this explanation cannot be the true one: for, 1. This deſcription of the Ancient of Days does not reſemble any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Father, which the ſcripture elſewhere affords; yet it is very ſimilar to that of Chriſt in the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ſt chapter of the Rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elation. 2. In verſe 21, 22, we find that the 'l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttle horn made war till the Ancient of Days <hi>came:</hi>' And the ſcripture elſewhere ſays, that when this enemy ſhall have finiſhed his work of miſchief, not the Father, but the Son
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032007_0049_0FF09F0B99A05550"/>ſhall <hi>come</hi> in ſome ſenſe or other. See 2 Theſſ. ii. 8. Therefore the time, when the Ancient of Days and one like the Son of Man ſhall come, cannot be the time of Chriſt's aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: for the aſcenſion of Chriſt took place long before the little horn had exiſtence, and hence it appears that the Ancient of Days can be no other but He, 'whoſe goings forth have been from of old, from everlaſting.' The Son of Man too, in verſe 13, ſignifies Chriſt. "From hence <hi>the Son of Man</hi> came to be a known phraſe for the Meſſiah among the Jews, and from hence it was taken and uſed ſo frequently in the goſpels" for this acceptation. Yet <hi>this one like</hi> the Son of Man, which Daniel ſaw, muſt be the people of the ſaints, as appears from his being brought to the Ancient of Days, and from the explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this viſion in the laſt of the chapter.

It is uſual for the ſcripture to ſpeak of a ſociety of perſons under the character of one: The man of ſin is a great number of perſons.</note> ſays the viſion, was given dominion and glory and a kingdom; and accordingly the explanation ſays, The kingdom and dominion, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven, was given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High. It is holden by all Proteſtants, that the beaſt with the little horn is the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beaſt with Popiſh power: and here we are taught that, when the Ancient of Days
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032007_0050_0FF09EBCD667B3D8"/>and one like the Son of Man ſhall come, this beaſt ſhall be ſlain, and his body deſtroyed and given to the burning flame: and what is this burning flame but that flaming fire in which the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven taking vengeance?</p>
                  <p>That this is the perſonal appearance of Chriſt and of the ſaints, appears from the harmony of this deſcription with thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which are allowed by all to ſignify their perſonal coming. Thoſe texts, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly predict this ſolemn event, repreſent it as attended with fire and an innumerable company of ſaints and angels: And here we read that 'His throne was as the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery ſtream iſſued and came forth from before him; thouſand thouſands miniſtered unto him, and ten thouſand times ten thouſand ſtood before him.' Here too one like the Son of Man comes with the clouds, verſe 13. And where does the ſcripture ſpeak of Chriſt or his ſaints coming with the clouds, without intending their perſonal coming?</p>
                  <p>Indeed, it ſeems impoſſible to conceive how a mere figurative conſtruction can be fixed on this paſſage which would render the ſenſe eaſy and natural. What ſpiritual behaviour ſhall appear in the ſaints hereafter, or what ſhall be done to them, which may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to their collecting and meeting Chriſt in the clouds, by any figure of ſpeech which the ſcripture uſes? But, if we allow this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032007_0051_0FF09F11DE4494B8"/>to ſpeak for itſelf, how exactly it accords with other ſcriptures, which declare that 'the ſaints ſhall be one;<note n="*" place="bottom">John xvii. 21.</note> ſhall be caught up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the clouds,<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. iv. 17.</note> to meet the Lord in the air, and that by the inſtrumentality of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who ſhall gather the elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.'<note n="‡" place="bottom">Matt. xxiv. 31.</note> Beſides, it is granted by all, that the fulfilment of Daniel's prophecy extends to the <hi>time</hi> of Chriſt's perſonal coming. There is no other paſſage in this book deſcribing that ſolemn event which may not be as eaſily figurized as this. But muſt we ſuppoſe that Chriſt's ſecond coming is not mentioned at all in this prophecy? Muſt we ſuppoſe that an event of ſuch infinite concernment to mankind; to which all the preceding events are ſubſervient, and to which the prophecy extends; ſhould be wholly omitted in this prophecy? By no means. Therefore this coming of Chriſt and the ſaints muſt need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p n="9">9. The principal events of the above prophecy are briefly predicted, with an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent alluſion thereto, in the ſecond epiſtle to the Theſſalonians. The firſt chapter men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the future revelation of Chriſt in flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire; and as the ſubject continues to the next, the Apoſtle exhorts them not to be ſhaken in mind, or diſcouraged, as though Chriſt would not appear at all, if he did not
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032007_0052_0FF09EBE613CF4F8"/>appear in a few years: 'Now we beſeech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in mind, neither by ſpirit nor by word nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Chriſt is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means.' Then he tells them what ſhall be firſt; not a Millennium, but a falling away, and the revelation of that Wicked one, 'whom the Lord ſhall conſume by the Spirit of his mouth, and deſtroy by the brightneſs of his coming.' Here <hi>the coming of Chriſt,</hi> or a like phraſe, is three times uſed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a very few verſes. The two firſt verſes which have this phraſe, are allowed to ſignify that coming of Chriſt which ſhall be perſonal; and when it is here mentioned the third time, the ſame ſubject is continued; and the plain deſign of the ſubject is to ſatisfy the minds of Chriſtians reſpecting <hi>the time</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>perſonal</hi> coming. Therefore, when this phraſe is here uſed the third time, a figurative ſenſe muſt not be admitted without ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon than merely to ſupport an hypoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſis. Such a conſtruction is unnatural; a perplexity of language without a beauty, and oppoſite to the Apoſtle's deſign, as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, leaving the mind of the Chriſtian as much in the dark as ever with reſpect to the time of Chriſt's perſonal coming.<note n="*" place="bottom">The argument of Mr. Spalding on this paſſage, page 6, appears to the writes worthy of particular notice. "The Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is here diſcourſing," he ſays, "concerning the proper coming of Chriſt and uſed the ſame word, tees parouſias, coming, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey ſuch an idea in the firſt verſe; and no ſign being given of the variation of its meaning, is could not be uſed to convey a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent idea in the eighth verſe, and be intelligible: for if the ſame diſtinguiſhing mark of the difference, they can give no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Paul did not uſe words in this manner. Nothing can be more unwarranted from the ſtyle of his writings, than to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he uſed the word <hi>coming,</hi> in the firſt verſe, for the proper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, and in a few following verſes before he left the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, without the leaſt intimation of varying its meaning, uſed it again, for his word or Spirit, or for ſome event of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we know not what." Can this reaſoning be fairly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered?</note> "It was
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032007_0053_0FF09F05B5745B50"/>a point of great importance," ſays Dr. New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in favour of this comment, "for the Theſſalonians not to be miſtaken in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: becauſe if they were taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the coming of Chriſt was at hand, and he ſhould not come according to their expectation, they might be ſtaggered in their faith; and finding part of their creed to be falſe, might be haſty enough to conclude that the whole was ſo. The Apoſtle therefore cautions them in the ſtrongeſt manner againſt this deluſion, and aſſures them that other memorable events will take place before the coming of our Lord." Doubtleſs then this paſſage means as it ſpeaks, when it declares that Chriſt will deſtroy the man of ſin by the brightneſs of his coming. So the phraſe was explained by Juſtin Martyr: "Chriſt ſhall appear from heaven in glory," he ſays, "when the man of apoſtaſy, ſpeaking great things againſt the Moſt High, ſhall vex us Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians."<note n="†" place="bottom">Dialogue with Tripho, page 336.</note>

Thus it appears, that the commencement of the Millennium will be rendered glorious by Chriſt's perſonal preſence. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, as this ſolemn and happy ſcene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, the ſigns of Chriſt's coming begin to appear. Nothing can be more viſible than the following ſigns of Chriſt's coming in the moral world.</p>
                  <p>Deiſm, which laughs at the idea of a God in human form appearing in the clouds, was ſcarcely known formerly in Chriſtendom; but now it is come, and come it muſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what it denies, that Peter was a prophet, and Chriſt is at hand. 2 Pet. iii. 3, 4. 'There ſhall come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, and ſaying, Where is the promiſe of his coming?' Paul ſays, 2 Tim. iii. 'In the laſt days perilous times ſhall come; for men ſhall be blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith; for as Jannes and Jambres withſtood Moſes, ſo do theſe men alſo reſiſt the truth.' Jannes and Jam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres withſtood Moſes by endeavouring to rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſent him as an impoſtor; ſo do theſe men alſo reſiſt the truth by endeavouring to rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſent all the prophets as impoſtors. It is here predicted too that men ſhall be 'lovers of their own ſelves,' which may ſignify that the expreſſions of ſelf-love ſhould abundantly prevail. And, not to mention the abounding of ſelfiſh practices, was there ever an age in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032007_0055_0FF09EFB319A3630"/>which ſelfiſh religion was ſo boldly taught as in this? Was there ever an age, in which there were half ſo many teachers highly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, 'who make ſad the hearts of the righteous, whom God has not made ſad, and ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked; that he ſhould not turn from his evil way by promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him life.' Theſe liberal ſentiments tend to produce liberal conduct, carnal ſecurity and licentious practices. Therefore they muſt prevail, and undoubtedly will, more and more, over all the Chriſtian world! For it is neceſſary when Chriſt ſhall appear, that he ſhould find the world in juſt juch carnal ſecurity as theſe ſentiments moſt evidently produce; that he ſhould find the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved from the terror of that old fiction of eternal puniſhment, which frighted the Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ages. 'As in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; ſo ſhall the coming of the Son of Man be.' Matt. xxiv. 38, 39.</p>
                  <p>Another ſign of Chriſt's coming, which now appears, is a general belief of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. The Chriſtians in general believe that Chriſt will appear ſome time or other, but not quickly. They expect firſt a long thouſand years, happy years. Already they ſee Popery declining, knowledge and liberty prevailing, and preſently they expect to ſee
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032007_0056_0FF09EC2E5E2F1B0"/>religion too prevailing every where through the Chriſtian world; not conſidering that the prevalence of knowledge and liberty too, the latter being the effect of the former, loudly announce that 'the day of the Lord is at hand:' for 'even to the time of <hi>the end</hi> many ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed.' Dan. xii. 4.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Chriſtians, it is well known, cheriſhed no ſuch opinion as that which is now oppoſed. Polycarp, a diſciple of St. John, intimately converſant with him, and who doubtleſs knew that apoſtle's opinion of his own revelation; expreſsly taught that Chriſt would introduce the Millennium by his perſonal appearance. So did Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, ſo did all the moſt eminent ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as Dr. Hammond, a zealous oppoſer of the millennarians, was forced to acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge. But as Popery prevailed, this opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion failed; and as Popery in the ſixteenth century failed, this opinion prevailed. But now again it is almoſt entirely exploded, and the general cry is, Peace and ſafety—Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all men—brighter days are approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than were ever enjoyed heretofore—to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundantly. We are come to the age of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. If ever there was a cry of peace and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in any age of the world, there is now; but what faith the word of prophecy? 'When they ſhall ſay, <hi>Peace and ſafety,</hi> then ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh upon them, as pain upon a
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032007_0057_0FF09F07F2A7BE30"/>woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape.' The ſcripture muſt be fulfilled, Chriſt muſt come as a thief, and at an hour when men in general have no expectation of him.</p>
                  <p>What is the ſtate of the Chriſtian world in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral at this day, but a ſign of Chriſt's coming? The Chriſtian world in theſe laſt days, is the antitype of the Jewiſh world in their laſt days, as Preſident Edwards has juſtly obſerved.<note n="*" place="bottom">"God in his providence now ſeems to be <hi>acting over again the ſame part which he did a little before Chriſt came.</hi> The age wherein Chriſt came into the world, was an age wherein learning greatly prevailed, and was at a greater height than ever it had been before; and yet wickedneſs never prevailed more than then. So now, learning is at a great height at this day in the world, far beyond what it was in the age when Chriſt appeared; and now the world, by their learning and wiſdom, do not know God. They are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably deluded; ſtumble and fall in matters of religion, as in mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night darkneſs. Truſting to their learning, they grope in the day time as in the night; run into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> manner of corrupt opinions and pernicious and fooliſh errors. They ſcorn to ſubmit their reaſon to divine revelation, to believe any thing which is above their comprehenſion; and ſo, being wiſe in their own eyes, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fools."—<hi>Hiſt. of Redemption,</hi> p. 325.
<p>'The wicked ſhall do wickedly and none of them ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand;' they ſhall not diſcern the ſigns of the times.</p>
                     </note> The Jews of that time had much more knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge than their anceſtors; and how much more enlightened is the preſent age than any former one! The Jews had many among them who maintained the form of godlineſs, but denied the power; and how many of this ſort have we! The Jews had many Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees or infidels among them; ſo have we. The Jews could not get evidence enough that Jeſus was the Chriſt. 'How long doſt thou make us to doubt? if thou be the Chriſt, tell us <hi>plainly.</hi>' Our Deiſts labour under the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032007_0058_0FF09EC4C1977498"/>ſame difficulty: "I remember," ſays Paley, "hearing an unbeliever ſay, that if God had given a revelation, he would have written it in the ſkies." The Jews ſaid, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.' Such is the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of modern catholiciſm. There were thoſe among the Jews who compaſſed ſea and land to make one proſelyte, without promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true piety, as our Jeſuits have done in China, India, and other parts of the globe. And yet there were remarkable revivals of religion among the Jews by the miniſtry of John, of Chriſt and his apoſtles. So there are now among us. The dawn of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation appeared in that day among the Jews. The light then was not clear nor dark; but it was one (remarkable) day known <hi>to the Lord,</hi> (not to men in general) not day nor night. So the dawn of the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium now appears with us; a light not clear nor dark; a day known to the Lord, not to men in general, for they do not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern this time.</p>
                  <p>The miniſtry of John was a lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of what has been performed among Chriſtians in the three laſt centuries. John was Elias. And the Bible, revived by the invention of the preſs, and improved by the Proteſtant miniſtry, is our Elias. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects are as if Elias had viſited the world again to cure the people of idolatry.
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032007_0059_0FF09F1A43D47418"/>'The hearts of the fathers are turned to the children, and the hearts of the children to the fathers.' Mal. iv. 6. The thoughts or ſentiments of the firſt Chriſtian fathers, with reſpect to religious worſhip, are brought into union with ours, and ours into union with theirs; and ſo the purity of the ancient Chriſtian worſhip is reſtored, as the purity of the ancient Jewiſh worſhip was reſtored by John and by the firſt Elias. The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the firſt Elias was in the concluſion of the literal time, times and an half of famine. And the reformation by our Elias is in the concluſion of the <hi>prophetical</hi> time, times and an half of Popiſh famine: 'a famine not of bread and water, but of hearing the word of the Lord.' And thus that in Mal. iv. 5, has a ſecondary and antitypical accompliſhment, as well as the reſt of that chapter. The ſame prophecy, which deſcribes the type, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily deſcribe the antitype.<note n="*" place="bottom">'I have reſerved ſeven thouſand men,' was the Lord's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Elias's complaint. Paul, viewing that time as an image of his own, declares, 'Even ſo now there is <hi>a remnant,</hi> according to the election of grace.' Seven is the number of perfection: God's remnant is always a perfect number, amidſt all the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin and Satan. But Paul's time was an image of ours: therefore we read that, when the witneſſes roſe, 'there were ſlain of men <hi>ſeven thouſand,</hi>' to the Popiſh cauſe. Seven thouſand is a great number; ſo was God's perfect number after the witneſſes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>oſe, much greater than could be naturally expected, conſidering the ſad and dark ſtate of religion which had preceded. Seven thouſand were more than Elias thought of. When the witneſſes roſe, there was a great earthquake or revolution; the Greek em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire fell, and the knowledge of the ſcriptures, with reformation in Europe, was the conſequence. But the learned reader, by conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering the original, (<hi>names</hi> of men) will determine whether the comment of Dr. Goodwin and Mr. Jurieu on this paſſage is not to be preferred.</note> And as
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032007_0060_0FF09EC6B2822918"/>there were ſeventy weeks from the time of the return of the Jews from Babylon to their final ruin; ſo there is nearly the ſame por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time from the beginning of our deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance from myſtical Babylon to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the Millennium. Theſe and other ſigns which might be noticed, give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming evidence that the end of our world is near, and the Judge ſtands before the door.</p>
                  <p>INFERENCES.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence we muſt expect, that the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world in future will be ſubject to much ſin and trouble. Licentious opinions and practices will prevail almoſt every where. The pure goſpel, and thoſe few who embrace it, derided and rejected. 2 Tim. iii. 1—5. 'In the laſt days perilous times ſhall come: for men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,' &amp;c. Even the wicked in time paſt have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently under cloſe reſtraint by their fear of future puniſhment; but for the future, this fear is to be named <hi>ſuperſtition.</hi> Since the reformation, men have enjoyed a precious opportunity to know and embrace the truth; but they have not improved it. Therefore God will now chooſe their deluſions, and firſt rain ſnares upon them, then fire and brimſtone and an horrible tempeſt; this ſhall be the portion of their cup. And as the reſtraints of religion will be caſt off, ſo
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032007_0061_0FF09F0E6E53D148"/>it is not improbable that civil government will loſe much of its energy, and men will be diſpoſed, not only to think, but to act, that which is right in their own eyes, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the welfare of civil ſociety, as well as religion: For they ſhall be 'traitors, heady, high-minded. Preſumptuous, ſelf-willed, deſpiſing government, and not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities,' 2 Tim. iii. 4. 2 Pet. ii. 10. Thus ſhall iniquity abound, and great judgments muſt follow, which yet will not reform mankind; but they ſhall harden their hearts more and more, like Pharaoh and his ſervants, till the day ſhall break forth when God will get honour upon them, ſo that they ſhall never deſpiſe his Son, nor his word, nor his people any more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence PERHAPS, we have an eaſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of that in Matt. xxiv. 20, whatever primary reference it may hove to the eſcape from Jeruſalem. 'Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day.' Winter is the time when ſummer and harveſt are ended. Summer and harveſt are ſimilitudes, which the ſcripture uſes to rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſent our accepted time and day of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 'The harveſt is paſt, the ſummer is ended, and we are not ſaved.' When Chriſt ſhall appear in the clouds to deſtroy the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened world, their harveſt will be paſt and their ſummer ended. The winter of divine wrath ſhall commence, ſuch 'great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Therefore pray ye that your flight may be <hi>in ſeaſon, before</hi> the winter and <hi>before</hi> the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day: 'for then ſhall be great tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as never was before; no, nor ever ſhall be.'</p>

'And the angel, which I ſaw ſtand upon the ſea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and ſware by Him who liveth forever and ever, that there ſhould be time no longer; but in the days of the voice of the ſeventh angel, when he ſhall <hi>begin</hi> to ſound, the myſtery of God ſhould be finiſhed.' <hi>Time ſhall be no longer;</hi> that is, the accepted time with the Chriſtian world ſhall be no longer; the time of the Chriſtian diſpenſation ſhall be no longer. All thoſe nations of ſinners, which have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore enjoyed and rejected the goſpel, ſhall now be as Sodom and be made like unto Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032007_0063_0FF33B5F52C17F98"/>and the vineyard, which they have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed, ſhall be given to nations bringing forth the fruits thereof. <hi>The myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed.</hi> The hand of the wicked has long vexed the righteous; and while the latter have been perſecuted and counted as ſheep for the ſlaughter, the former have flouriſhed like the green bay tree. And thus the prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence of God toward the church has been myſterious. He has ſuffered ſin to practiſe and proſper for a time, times and an half. This has been one great part of the myſtery of God; a myſtery no doubt to angels as well as men. But now the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, when the Millennium ſhall commence, and the ſeventh angel ſhall begin to ſound. God will now proceed to 'lay judgment to the line and righteouſneſs to the plummet, and reward mankind according to their works,' and ſin will never again be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to practiſe and proſper as heretofore.</p>
                  <p>When Daniel had a ſimilar viſion, (chap. xii. 7) he heard the man clothed in linen ſwear by Him that liveth forever, that 'when he,' i. e. the man of ſin, 'ſhall have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed to ſcatter the power of the holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pley, <hi>all theſe things,</hi>' i. e. all the perſecutions of the church, <hi>ſhall be finiſhed.</hi> Hence the propriety of the ſenſe which our tranſlators have given to the phraſe, CHRONOS OUK ESTAI ETI,<hi>time ſhould be no longer.</hi> To ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it <hi>the time ſhall not be yet,</hi> gives to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>the</hi> the force of a relative; but there is
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032007_0064_0FF09ECD4F895350"/>no relative, not even an article prefixed in the original. This conſtruction too depreſſes the ſublimity of this paſſage. How majeſtic the poſture of the angel! How terrible his voice as when a lion roareth! How ſolemn the oath! All to command the greateſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ſomething he is about to utter. What is it? that the time ſhall not be yet? that the affairs of the world ſhall for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time be as they are at preſent? No; but ſomething far more ſolemn and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting: <hi>Time ſhall be no longer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The commencement of the ſeventh trumpet, the ſeventh vial and the deſcent of New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, all ſynchronize by Mr. Mede's Table. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, when the ſeventh trumpet begins to ſound, <hi>Time is no longer, and the myſtery of God is finiſhed:</hi> When the ſeventh vial is poured out, there was a voice from the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying, <hi>It is done:</hi> And when New Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem deſcended,—<hi>It is done,</hi> ſaid he who ſat on the throne. Here then is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, that the ſenſe which the tranſlators have given to the above phraſe, is the true and proper conſtruction. Hence the ſeven vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als are properly called the ſeven <hi>laſt</hi> plagues, though they all precede the Millennium.</p>

                  <p>WHAT a ſolemn deſcription is that in 2 Pet. iii. 10! 'The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, the elements ſhall melt with fervent heat, and the earth with the works that are therein ſhall be burnt up.' That this conflagration will be ſuch literally, is manifeſt in that the apoſtle does not appear to ſpeak in figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive language; but with that familiarity of ſtyle, which is always proper for an epiſtle. It is univerſally allowed that the deluge was ſuch literally, and here in a familiar letter Peter tells his brethren, that as the old world was deſtroyed by water, ſo the preſent world will be deſtroyed by fire. 'The elements ſhall melt with fervent heat;' that is, the preſent ſtate of the elements will be in ſome manner changed with fervent heat. The preſent ſtate of the aerial heavens (above which the Pſalmiſt repreſents the waters to be) will then be diſſolved and paſs away. A tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perhaps not much unlike that of the air and elements in the land of the four cities when fire and brimſtone rained upon them. 'The earth alſo and the works which are therein ſhall be burnt up,' as the land of the plain and the works of it once were. But the prophecy of the conſlagration, like other
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032007_0066_0FF33B5CD19E0E38"/>prophecies, may have different periods of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment, one at the beginning, the other at the concluſion of the Millennium.<note n="*" place="bottom">When John had a viſion of the final judgment, (Rev. xx. 11 to 15) he ſays, 'I ſaw a great white throne and him that ſat on it, from whoſe face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was no place found for them. Then probably Chriſt will appear in ſuch majeſty and glory as never ſhall have been ſeen before. Of that glory this attending his perſonal coming may be viewed as a prerepreſentation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. Hopkins and ſeveral others have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and proved, that Ezekiel's prophecy of Gog and Magog has two periods of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment; the firſt introducing, and the other concluding the Millennium. Now that the firſt Gog and Magog will be deſtroyed by fire, is evident not only from Ezek. xxxviii. 22, but from the <hi>time</hi> of their deſtruction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in which the Millennium ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and then, as already ſhewn, Chriſt will appear in flaming ſire, taking vengeance. It is alſo very evident from Rev. xx. 9, that the laſt Gog and Magog will be devoured by ſire. Therefore, as there will be two Gogs at two different periods; ſo there will be two fires at two different periods to devour them. The firſt fire, a partial; the laſt, a complete fulfilment of the above ſolemn pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. The ſame prophecy we find in Mal. iv. 1. 'Behold, the day cometh which ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, and all they who do wickedly, ſhall be as ſtubble.' Nothing could appear merely in theſe words, when firſt written, to ſhow that they ever would have more than one period of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment;
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032007_0067_0FF09F0000F51248"/>yet the oppoſite is maintained by the moſt approved expoſitors. This text was undoubtedly fulfilled in part when the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh polity and diſpenſation were deſtroyed; but now, when the Millennium ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, it will be accompliſhed far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively, and at the laſt period its fulfilment will be complete.</p>
                  <p>That then next conflagration will not be univerſal, appears by Sect. I. which implies the continued propagation of mankind in the Millennium, i. e. after the world ſhall have been deſtroyed by fire. Now, if that fire ſhould be univerſal, how will any part of our ſpecies be preſerved unleſs by a miracle? But the ſcripture ſpeaks of no preſerving miracle in that day, but that which ſhall change the ſaints, tranſmit them to the clouds and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, in which ſtate they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels of God in heaven.<note n="*" place="bottom">That God and Magog will be the degenerate poſterity of other and a very ſordid repreſentation of their condition.</note> It is moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional therefore to ſuppoſe, that a part of our ſpecies will be preſerved without a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and conſequently that the fire will not be univerſal. And does not the ſcripture clearly foretel ſuch a preſervation, and that not of one or two families, but of whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
                  <p>When Peter had finiſhed his deſcription of the conſlagration, he adds, 'Nevertheleſs we, <hi>according to his promiſe,</hi> look for new heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032007_0068_0FF09ECF907B6028"/>and a new earth wherein dwelleth right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs;' that is, 'according to his promiſe' in Iſa. lxvth. and lxvith. chapters; for no where elſe do we find this promiſe expreſsly mentioned in the prophets. Therefore no doubt the apoſtle Peter and the prophet Iſaiah both ſpeak of the ſame new earth,<note n="*" place="bottom">With perhaps this difference, this prophecy of Iſaiah <hi>may have</hi> an aſpect to the new and more happy ſtate of civil ſociety occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by our goſpel, as a figure of the real new earth ſo plainly predicted by the apoſtle Peter.</note> and conſequently of the ſame fire as that which ſhall immediately precede and be the occaſion of it. The prophet having deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bleſſings of the new earth, proceeds to tell how they ſhall be introduced: 'For behold the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots, like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.' Iſa. lxvi. 15. This text, as appears by the connexion, was fulfilled only in the type by the firſt perſonal coming of Chriſt, and the conſequent ruin of the Jews. The far more ſolemn and extenſive fulfilment is yet future, when the Chriſtian diſpenſation and world ſhall be finiſhed, and as much of the globe as the ſcripture terms <hi>the whole earth,</hi> and <hi>the whole world,</hi> will be deſtroyed by real fire from heaven. 'For by fire and by his ſword will the Lord plead with <hi>all fleſh;</hi>' verſe 16. Yet not <hi>all</hi> in the unlimited ſenſe; for obſerve what follows. 'I will ſend thoſe that eſcape of them to the nations, Tarſhiſh, Pul and Lud, that draw the bow, Tubal and
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032007_0069_0FF09F1E3A190FE8"/>Javan, the iſles afar off, which have not heard my fame nor ſeen my glory, and they ſhall declare my glory among the Gentiles,' &amp;c. This was fulfilled in the type, when thoſe who eſcaped the Jewiſh deſtruction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated the goſpel among the nations; and as the beſt commentators allow that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in general of this chapter have a ſecondary aſpect to a period yet future, what reaſon, which would not beg the queſtion, can be offered why this paſſage, as well as the reſt, may not look to the ſame future pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod? Tarſhiſh, Pul, and other nations here mentioned, were Pagans, unacquainted with the Jewiſh goſpel; but when the Jewiſh economy and nation were deſtroyed, a brighter goſpel ſhone upon theſe nations than was ever enjoyed before.</p>
                  <p>And there are nations now on the globe which we may venture to call the antitype of Tarſhiſh, Pul and Lud. They are Pagans, unacquainted with our goſpel, ſo have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us ſimilar to that which we once had to the Jews. And when our economy and world ſhall be deſtroyed, then will be their time of love. Then the iſles afar off, New Holland, New Guinea, Otaheite, Owhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hee, and other dark regions, which have not heard God's fame, nor ſeen his glory, ſhall enjoy a far brighter glory than was ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed before. And thus God's dealings with mankind will be like what they have been in time paſt at the burning of Sodom, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032007_0070_0FF09ECAEB8B9D10"/>of the Egyptians, and the ruin of the Jews: There will be three diſtinctions of men treated in a very different manner: The righteous, who will be ſaved; the enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſinner, who will be deſtroyed; and the ignorant ſinner, who will be ſpared to take notice of, and improve the warning.<note n="*" place="bottom">They who eſcaped the Jewiſh deſtruction became our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous teachers; ſo they who ſhall eſcape our deſtruction <hi>may</hi> become miraculous teachers to the reſt of mankind, for any thing which yet appears to the contrary. In that day, 'when the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhall be as David, the houſe of David,' the royal reigning family, 'ſhall be as God,' perfectly holy as God is, ('We know that, when He ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him') and 'be as the angel of the Lord before them,' to guide, rule and inſtruct them. 'The nations of them who are ſaved ſhall walk (not in New Jeruſalem) but in the light of it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This inſtruction, pure and infallible, they will communicate to the church militant, and then no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they will ſee eye to eye, and worſhip one God in one way; and indeed it is difficult to conceive how mankind ever ſhould arrive to ſuch univerſal rectitude and harmony of ſentiment as will accompliſh this promiſe without ſome new revelation from heaven. The prevalence of Chriſtian knowledge, and our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reformations in theſe laſt days, have done nothing to effect this purpoſe. Chriſtians are now no more united than they were in the ſixteenth century. The brighteſt geniuſes, the moſt extenſive knowledge, and the pureſt viſible piety are found in thoſe who widely differ in ſentiment. Such is the weakneſs of the human mind, and the blinding nature of ſin in the moſt pious and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there ſeems to be nothing, from the reaſon of things, which can lead us to imagine that this our ſad ſtate will be much amended, while the preſent diſpenſation remains and the world have only imperfect men for inſtructors.</note> This world, ſo ſoon to be ruined, is doubtleſs on this northern ſide of the Equator. Here and here only has the goſpel ſhone with the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt radiance. Here the four monarchies are. Here ſits myſtical Babylon. Here the beaſt and the falſe prophet are; and here are they
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032007_0071_0FF09F1BF40D12C0"/>who obey not the goſpel, and on whom Chriſt will take vengeance when he ſhall appear.<note n="*" place="bottom">Not that we ſhould limit this deſtruction by the Equator, or any other line; but the thing inſiſted on is, that where the pure goſpel has appeared, there will be this conflagration. "That ſome nations will remain for the righteous to reign over" after the conflagration, was the opinion of Lactantius, Dr. Creſener, and the ingenious Mr. Mede.—<hi>Mather's Diſſert. p.</hi> 30, 31, 32. <hi>See alſo Mr. Mede's Comment. p.</hi> 129—135; <hi>and Diatrib. p.</hi> 553.</note> Here too we ſee the miraculous Aurora Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>realis, an appearance of blood, fire, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour of ſmoke. And are we abſolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this is not a ſign of Chriſt's coming? But who ever ſaw juſt ſuch a phenomenon in the ſouthern hemiſphere?</p>
                  <p>Parallel to the text now explained is that in Zeph. iii. 8—10, which repreſents the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium as introduced by a conflagration. It declares that God will then pour upon the nations '<hi>all</hi> his fierce anger,' and that '<hi>all</hi> the earth ſhall be devoured by the fire of his jealouſy.' By this phraſe it would ſeem at firſt view as if the whole globe would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; but the next verſes plainly ſpeak the contrary: 'For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord, and ſerve him with one conſent. From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, my ſuppliants, even the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of my diſperſed, ſhall bring their, offering.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, that though the above prophecies <hi>may</hi> primarily refer to the ruin of the Jews, and ultimately to the final judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet their next accompliſhment will be
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032007_0072_0FF09ED128032A00"/>the deſtruction, not of the whole globe, but only of the whole world.<note n="*" place="bottom">Many enlightened ſinner, in the ſouth of Africa, in Aſia and America, though the may ſuffer great judgments, will, if the above hypotheſis be true, eſcape the conflagration, agreeable to l.zck. xxxix. 2, and Zech. xiv. 16, 17. But what is meant by the weapons, the ſepulture, and ſoveral other particulars of Gog and Magog.

                  <p>INFERENCES.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From what has been obſerved, it is plain that the general events attending Chriſt's ſecond appearance, are typified by thoſe which attended his firſt appearance. At his firſt appearance, he gathered in his elect from the Jewiſh world, burnt their city and temple, and gave a more glorious goſpel to us than was ever enjoyed before. So in the end of our Chriſtian world, the wicked will be ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from the juſt, and caſt into a furnace of fire, and the next world, as preſently may appear more clearly, will be filled with ſuch goſpel glory as never was enjoyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Behold here the wiſdom and goodneſs of God! That part of the human race, who wait longeſt for the goſpel, enjoy its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt glory, when it appears. And thus 'the elder ſerves the younger, and more are the children of the deſolate than the children of the married wife, ſaith the Lord.'</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How gloriouſly manifeſt are the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſtice of God in the deſtruction of our enlightened world! How reaſonable it is that ſo many unthankful ſinners, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032007_0073_0FF09F18B6C5C638"/>ſo wonderfully from all the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by a day of grace, ſhould be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too by a day of judgment! So the Jews were treated: 'You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore will I puniſh you,' ſaid God. And are we better than they? No, in no wiſe. Our knowledge, and conſequently our guilt, is far greater than that of the Jews. In myſtical Babylon will be found the blood of all thoſe who were ſlain upon the earth. The Chriſtians have ſlain many more ſaints than the Jews. And inſtead of pitying the heathen, and exerting our utmoſt to illuminate them and diffuſe the pure goſpel among them; we have cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and robbed them, enſlaved and murdered them. 'Our ſins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered our iniquities' committed in various parts of the globe; in South America and Africa, in the Eaſt and Weſt Indies.</p>
                  <p>The advancement of pure religion among the Pagan nations? or private wealth? which of theſe has been generally the ultimate end of all our diſcoveries and commerce in diſtant parts of the globe? Is the queſtion difficult? Commerce, in itſelf lawful and beneficial, has been carried on in a manner highly injurious to the Chriſtian cauſe. The Chriſtian world is the centre of the globe for commerce and commercial wickedneſs, the great antitype of ancient Babylon and Tyre. In Rev. xviii. 12—18, we may ſec our variety ſtore, and
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032007_0074_0FF09ED364B82198"/>the manner of its utter deſtruction. And though the preſent generation may be exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally better than the former, in <hi>ſome reſpects,</hi> and boaſt, like the Jews, that we are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with our fathers in the blood of the prophets; yet are we not as corrupt, and more ſo, in <hi>other reſpects?</hi> How much leſs odious to the All-ſearching Eye is the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened blaſphemer than the ignorant perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor! What licentiouſneſs in principle and practice now prevails every where! What contempt of religion and the Bible! What horrid atheiſm opens its mouth againſt the heavens! Whom does our increaſing infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity reject? Is it not the ſame Meſſiah who was rejected by the infidel Jews, when the utter ruin of that people was at hand? Therefore ſince we, like the Jews, are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from all mankind by a day of grace; ſo we ſhall ſoon be diſtinguiſhed by a day of judgment. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence learn how dangerous the mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern doctrine is that the Millennium will be introduced by the ordinary courſe of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. There is a generation at hand who are to ſee and ſuffer this fiery ſtorm. The more this doctrine, which puts it far off, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails among us, the more probably it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in the ſucceeding generations; ſo that the laſt generation will be greatly injured, and rendered deſtitute of that warning, ſo neceſſary for their momentous and ſolemn ſituation.

                  <p>
                     <hi>But what a pity it is,</hi> it may be ſaid, <hi>that ſo many great and good things ſhould be deſtroyed, ſuch great riches and great improvements in knowledge!</hi> The anſwer is, 'The Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth.' Why are many youths, of extraordinary talents, cut off in the bloom of life? Why have the moſt flouriſhing cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies ſunk by earthquakes?

It is now the creed of multitudes, that the confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration would be <hi>on the whole</hi> for the worſe, and their inference is, that it will never come at all; ſo they put far off the evil day.

Babylon is conſuming by the Spirit of Chriſt's mouth in a manner inviſible to many; for the operation of ſpirit is inviſible. But her final burning will be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral and viſible; for it will be effected by the brightneſs of Chriſt's coming.</note>

                     <hi>SECTION IV.</hi> The Millennium introduced by the Corporeal Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection of the Saints.</head>
                  <p>NO part of ſcripture more clearly deſcribes the Millennium, its manner of beginning and ending, than the xxth. of Revelation. Here the plain account is, that One, having the key of hell and of death, will <hi>come down</hi> from heaven, free the nations from deception, and raiſe the ſaints from the dead, who ſhall reign with Chriſt on the earth a thouſand years; that the reſt of the dead ſhall not live again till the thouſand years are finiſhed, and then will follow the general reſurrection and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; all which is very plain and intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on the truth of the ſcheme under preſent inquiry. But on the truth of the contrary, the chapter is exceedingly difficult to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. We find, by verſe 4th. this happy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod introduced by the reſurrection of the ſaints. 'I ſaw thrones, and they ſat upon them, and judgment was given unto them. And I ſaw the ſouls of them who, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for the witneſs of Jeſus and for the word of God, and who had not worſhipped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his mark upon their foreheads nor in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years.' That this firſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection is not figurative, but literal, may appear by the following arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="53" facs="unknown:032007_0077_0FF09ED58721D610"/>
1. In whatever ſenſe we underſtand this chapter, whether literally or allegorically, it is certain here is no account of two ſorts of death and reſurrection, in thoſe verſes which <hi>expreſsly</hi> mention a reſurrection, as ſo many have imagined; but the plain repreſentation is, that two ſorts of <hi>perſons,</hi> who were dead in the ſame ſenſe, ſhould revive at two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent periods of time. This muſt appear to any one who properly and attentively conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers this phraſe, <hi>'the reſt of the dead.'</hi> If this paſſage is conſtrued to ſignify two ſorts of death and reſurrection, the neceſſary para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe would be worſe than tautology. <hi>I ſaw thoſe who had the temper of the martyrs, and they received this temper of mind and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſuffering ſtate a thouſand years; that is, ſome reigned twenty, others forty, ſixty or an hundred years, till the thouſand were expired. But</hi> the reſt <hi>of the dead, conſiſting of</hi> both ſorts, <hi>lived not again until the thouſand years were fulfilled.</hi> The above conſtruction cannot admit of a better paraphraſe, and is it not quite unintelligible?<note n="*" place="bottom">In the time of the American war there were once in the hoſpital at Cambridge, about forty ſick perſons. Three of them were men of eminent piety. A friend of mine at that time brought me intelligence that theſe three were reſtored to perfect health, but that the reſt of the ſick remained in the ſame afflicted ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I ſoon found to my great diſappointment that theſe three had all along been as ſick as any of the reſt. At the next interview I aſked this friend what he meant by telling me ſuch a ſtory. "I meant the truth," he replied, "I ſpoke figuratively: there is a great reformation among us. The <hi>cauſe</hi> of theſe three men has recovered from its unhealthy condition, and their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper of mind is manifeſt in our young converts, who are <hi>ſpiritually</hi> healed."</note> "This text,"
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032007_0078_0FF09EDBD933EF50"/>ſays Dr. Newton, "cannot admit of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory without the greateſt torture and violence: For with what propriety can it be ſaid that ſome of the dead, who were behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, lived, but the reſt of the dead lived not again; unleſs the dying and living again be the ſame in both, places, a proper death and reſurrection? If the martyrs riſe only in a ſpiritual ſenſe, then the reſt of the dead riſe only in a ſpiritual ſenſe; but if the reſt of the dead really riſe, the martyrs riſe in the ſame manner; there is no difference between them."<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſſertation on the Prophecies, Vol. II. p. 337.</note> "The firſt and ſecond reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt needs be of the ſame kind," ſays Preſident Mather, "otherwiſe the diſcourſe would be illogical." Piſcator ſays, "In every rational diſtinction the oppoſite parts are of the ſame kind. Here is a diſtinction of dead men living again, ſome at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the reſt at the end of the thouſand years; but thoſe, who live again after the thouſand years, live as to their bodies: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo muſt the other."<note n="†" place="bottom">Firſt Reſurrection, p. 19.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſome, expoſitors, who appear ſenſible of this difficulty, have recourſe to another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in order to turn this plain and eaſy account of the reſurrection into allegory. The martyrs, they ſay, will live again in the revival and flouriſhing of that cauſe which they eſpouſed, and which had been a long time dead among a world of enemies, who
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032007_0079_0FF09F1406089610"/>will now die in their turn, in that their cauſe will die: For Satan will now deceive the nations no more for a thouſand years: and then he will deceive again, and ſo theſe old enemies of religion will live again in the revival of their cauſe, while the martyrs in heaven will die again in their cauſe: Briefly, the righteous and the wicked will live and die by turns. As if John had ſaid, <hi>I ſaw the ſouls of them who were beheaded, and they revived in that their cauſe revived. I ſaw thrones and they ſat upon them in that their cauſe ſat upon them; but the reſt of thoſe who were dead, with reſpect to an oppoſite cauſe, lived not again in that cauſe till the thouſand years were finiſhed.</hi> But here is not all the difficulty. What a needleſs repetition does this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fix on this part of the chapter! What is the expulſion of darkneſs, but the effuſion of light? and what is the ligation of Satan and undeceiving of the nations, in verſe 1 to 3, but the revival of the martyrs' cauſe? If ſo, the account of the reſurrection in verſe 4th. tells nothing more than what was juſt told us before. The preceding verſes declare plainly that the martyrs ſhall revive in their cauſe, i. e. that their cauſe ſhall revive; and the 4th. verſe only repeats the ſame thing in another manner. Now it is uſual for the word of prophecy to repreſent the ſame thing differently in different viſions; but where do we find different repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame event in the ſame viſion
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032007_0080_0FF09EFCEFBDAA18"/>and almoſt in the ſame verſe? Beſides, how uninſtructive is the text rendered by this comment! If the cauſe of the righteous flouriſhes and triumphs over all a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, what perſon need be told that the cauſe of the wicked will <hi>not</hi> flouriſh for that thouſand years? Again, If the firſt reſurrection be only the revival of the martyrs in their cauſe; then the revival of the wicked in their cauſe after the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium, by the loaſing of Satan, will be the <hi>ſecond</hi> reſurrection. Why then does not the chapter call it a reſurrection, as well as the other, the ſame ſubject being continued? Why was this omiſſion? why this ſudden, unnatural tranſition from one kind of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory to another? Such a monſter in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage ſhould never be imputed to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without ſome better reaſon than merely the vindication of that hypotheſis, which puts the coming of Chriſt far off. It may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that the firſt reſurrection muſt be figur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative, becauſe it is here ſaid that the <hi>ſouls</hi> of thoſe, who were beheaded, lived; not their bodies. But how often do the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak by a ſynedoche like this! 'Every living ſoul died in the ſea,' means that every living body died in the ſen. Chriſt's '<hi>ſoul</hi> was not left in hell:' His body was not left in the grave. 'O let me eſcape thither,' ſays Lot, 'and <hi>my ſoul</hi> ſhall live:' My body ſhall live. And thus the ſouls of the martyrs liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, i. e. their bodies lived again. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032007_0081_0FF09F018A13D580"/>this paſſage muſt neceſſarily mean that two ſorts of perſons, righteous and wicked, who were dead in the ſame ſenſe and at the ſame time, revived at two different periods. The righteous firſt and the reſt after many days, even a thouſand years. Accordingly the prophet Iſaiah, predicting this very time, tells us, (chap. xxiv. 21, 22, 23) that the Lord 'will puniſh the hoſts of the high ones, which are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth, and they ſhall be gathered together as priſoners are gathered in the pit, and be ſhut up in priſon, and after <hi>many days</hi> ſhall they be viſited.' That <hi>then</hi> the moon ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and the ſun aſhamed, when the Lord ſhall reign in mount Zion and in Jeruſalem and before his ancients gloriouſly.' Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem which is above ſhall come down; the ancient prophets and ſaints will deſcend from heaven, aſſume their bodies, and Chriſt will reign before them gloriouſly in mount Zion and Jeruſalem: that is, in New Jeruſalem, the true glorified church collected from all preceding ages.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is allowed by all, that the ſecond event, which this chapter calls a reſurrection, muſt be underſtood literally. Therefore, other things being aqual, the firſt muſt be underſtood ſo too. That the account of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's being bound and looſed is figurative, is freely granted, and the figure appears at firſt view; but this is no proof that the account of the firſt reſurrection is figurative where
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032007_0082_0FF09EDEC17277D8"/>the contrary appears at firſt view. If this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count be an allegory, as ſo many imagine; then the other reſurrection, in the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the chapter, is entirely another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and has no very immediate relation to any preceding part of the chapter. But if we can allow the account of the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to mean as it ſpeaks, a plain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate relation appears between one part of the chapter and the other, and an eaſy, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful connexion, both of the ſtyle and ſubject, is conſpicuous through the whole.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will not be denied, that one great deſign of this chapter and of this whole proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecy, was to ſupport and comfort the church under her ſore trials of Pagan and Popiſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions. Now this great deſign is certainly moſt favoured by the explanation for which this ſection is pleading: It could not be ſo comfortable to the martyrs, when they were going to the ſtake, to believe that only their cauſe would revive, as to believe that both they and their cauſe would revive together. The martyrs have here a precious promiſe that, if they will loſe their lives for Chriſt's ſake, they ſhall ſave them; that, if they will ſuffer for Chriſt, they ſhall reign with him. If they will die faithfully, they ſhall live again and reign gloriouſly. And accordingly we are told in hiſtory, that a multitude of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs underſtood this promiſe literally, and were greatly comforted by it. And here we may ſee how unreaſonably ſome expoſitors
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032007_0083_0FF09F0334BCCF08"/>have uſed the promiſe of Elias, the manner of its fulfilment, as a key to this prophecy, by ſaying that John had the ſpirit of Elias. The caſe of that prophet, and that of the martyrs were very diſſimilar. The promiſe of Elias was a promiſe to the Jews; not to that proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et himſelf: for he had aſcended to heaven long before it was revealed. But the firſt reſurrection was a promiſe, not only to the church in general, but to the martyrs of Jeſus in particular, who have been chiefly born ſince this promiſe was revealed, and who ſtood in peculiar need of ſuch a clear and ſpecial manifeſtation of divine love, as the literal ſenſe of this promiſe affords.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſame literal ſenſe is confirmed by ſeveral other paſſages of ſcripture. In Iſa. xxiv. to xxvi. the reſurrection of the ſaints is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently mentioned as one of thoſe happy events which ſhall conſtitute the glory of the Millennium. Thoſe chapter declare, that when 'the Lord ſhall make unto all people a feaſt of fat things, and ſhall deſtroy the veil which is ſpread over all nations, he will ſwallow up death in victory.' And that this victory is not figurative, but literal, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the apoſtle's quoting this paſſage, and expreſsly declaring that it will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the corporeal reſurrection of the ſaints. 1 Cor. xv. 54. <hi>Then</hi> ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, 'Death is ſwallowed up in victory.' And when Paul ſpeaks of the reſurrection of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032007_0084_0FF09EE04DE22748"/>Chriſt as a proof of ours, he has doubtleſs in view that in Iſa. xxvi. 19. 'Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead <hi>body</hi> ſhall they ariſe. Awake! and ſing, ye who dwell in duſt! for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out her dead.' And the ſame prophecy declares, that the wicked ſhall <hi>not</hi> then be raiſed: 'O Lord, other lords beſides thee have had dominion over us. They are dead, they ſhall not live: they are deceaſed, they ſhall not riſe.' Iſa. xxvi. 13, 14. That is, they ſhall not riſe <hi>at preſent:</hi> for 'they ſhall be ſhut up in priſon, and after <hi>many days</hi> ſhall they be viſited.'<note n="*" place="bottom">This explanation is not new. This prophecy of Iſaiah was underſtood in the ſame light by a number of ancient expoſitors, both Jews and Chriſtians.—<hi>See Mather's Diſſertation, p.</hi> 16.</note> Chap. xxiv. 22. In chap. xxxv. which predicts the Millennium, we read that 'the ranſomed of the Lord (from the grave) ſhall return and come to Zion with ſongs, and everlaſting joy ſhall be upon their heads: they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away.' But ſorrow and ſighing will not flee away till the reſurrection. And in chap. lxvi. 14, the prophet, foretelling the ſame future glory, declares, that when the ſaints ſhall ſee it, not only will their hearts rejoice, but their <hi>bones</hi> alſo 'ſhall flouriſh like an herb.'</p>
                  <p>The departed ſaints are perfectly holy and much more happy than they were on earth; but ſtill the marks of God's diſpleaſure for
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032007_0085_0FF09EE6DE5E98E0"/>ſin are upon them. 'The Lord hath put away thy ſin,' ſays Nathan to David, 'but the child ſhall die, and the ſword ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thy houſe.' The ſad conſequence of ſin, which ſerves to keep it in memory, ſhall yet continue with you. Such is the caſe of every departed ſaint: his ſin is forgiven, but not wholly blotted out; and ſuch his caſe will continue till the reſurrection, by which all the marks of God's diſpleaſure for ſin will be wiped off from his people forever. Hence we have that in Acts iii. 19.—21. 'Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and be converted that your ſins may be blotted out:' When? 'When the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord: And he ſhall ſend Jeſus, which before was preached unto you, whom the heavens muſt receive till the times of the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution of all things.'</p>
                  <p>Theſe paſſages afford much confirming evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that there will be a bodily reſurrection in the Millennium, and that the dead in Chriſt will riſe long before the wicked. And why this ſlowneſs of heart to receive theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, which the prophets have ſpoken? Would ſuch a diſtinction be ſtrange or new? We have no account in ſcripture that any wicked man ever yet roſe from the dead; but many of the ſaints have riſen already; why then ſhould it be thought a thing incredible that many more ſaints may riſe long before the reſurrection of the wicked?</p>

5. Several events, which ſynchronize with the commencement of the Millennium, are inſeparably connected with the corporeal reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection of the ſaints. When the Millenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſhall begin, Chriſt will perſonally appear in flaming fire, as already ſhewn; and 'them who ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him. The Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the archangel and the trump of God: and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe. The Lord ſhall come with ten thouſand of his ſaints. The Lord my God ſhall come, and all the ſaints with thee.' And in Dan. vii. the ſaints come with the clouds to the Ancient of Days, when the Ancient of Days came and <hi>judgment was given</hi> to the ſaints of the Moſt High, and the time came that the ſaints poſſeſſed the kingdom.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. iv. 14—16. Jude 6. Zech. xiv. 5. Dan. vii. 22.</note> Doubtleſs theſe very ſaints appeared to John in viſion, when he 'ſaw thrones and they ſat upon them, and <hi>judgment was given unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is allowed by the beſt commentators, that the thouſand years will immediately ſucceed the one thouſand three hundred and thirty-five days. Dan. xii. 12. And then Daniel will ſtand in his lot, verſe 13. But 'go thou thy way till the end be: for thou ſhalt reſt (in the grave) and ſtand in thy lot at the end of the days;' that is, at the end of the one thouſand three hundred and thirty-five days. Theſe days expire with the time, times and an
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032007_0087_0FF09EF8D543F070"/>half nearly. 'The man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, held up his his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and ſware by Him who liveth forever, that it ſhall be for a time, times and an half, and when he (the vile perſon) ſhall have accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed to ſcatter the power of the holy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all theſe things ſhall be finiſhed.' Parallel to this was the viſion of John, Rev. x. 5 to 7. 'And the angel which I ſaw ſtand upon the ſea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and ſware by Him who liveth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever, that time ſhall be no longer.' But in the days of the voice of the ſeventh angel, when he ſhall begin to ſound, the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, as he hath ſpoken to his ſervants the <hi>prophets;</hi>' and to the prophet Daniel among the reſt. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the ſeventh angel ſhall ſound, 'God will judge the dead, and give reward unto his ſervants the prophets, to the ſaints and to them who fear his name, both ſmall and great.' And what can this reward be, but Daniel's lot, and the recompenſe which Chriſt has promiſed to the charitable 'at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the juſt?' And that this judgment and reward will be at the <hi>beginning,</hi> as well as at the concluſion of the Millennium, appears by carefully conſidering, that when 'the ſeventh angel ſhall <hi>begin</hi> to ſound, time ſhall be no longer, and the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed. Then <hi>the end</hi> will be of the one thouſand three hundred and thirty-five days,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032007_0088_0FF09EF54754C908"/>and conſequently that will be the time, when Daniel ſhall ſtand in his lot. Thus we ſee that the time of the firſt reſurrection is the time of Chriſt's coming, the time of the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the time when the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, when time ſhall be no longer, when Daniel ſhall ſtand in his lot, when God ſhall judge the dead, and give reward unto his ſervants the prophets. How plainly then it appears from this ſynchroniſm, that here is no other than a glorious promiſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal reſurrection of the ſaints.</p>
                  <p>To what has now been offered, there are ſome objections worthy of particular notice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When our Lord was examined by the high prieſt whether he was the Son of God, 'Jeſus ſaith unto him, Thou haſt ſaid; nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheleſs, I ſay unto you, hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of Man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en.' Matt. xxvi. 64. <hi>Did the high prieſt die in the Lord? if not, he will have no pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t in the firſt reſurrection. How then will he ſee the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven?</hi> To which it may be replied, that, beſides the impoſſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of knowing the high prieſt's character when he died, and that of others preſent at this examination; it ſhould be carefully no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that only the firſt part of this werſe ſeems to have been addreſſed to the high prieſt <hi>in particular:</hi> the latter part ſeems to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the Jews as a nation. The verb OPSESTHE is plural, <hi>ye</hi> ſhall ſee the Son of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:032007_0089_0FF09ED913FAB730"/>Man coming, &amp;c. as when he ſaid to the Jews, in chap. xxiii. 39, '<hi>Ye</hi> ſhall not ſee me henceforth till ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord;' that is, <hi>this nation</hi> ſhall not ſee me henceforth till ye, as a nation, are converted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there ſhould be a reſurrection before the deſtruction of the globe, how is it true that 'Man lieth down and riſeth not again till the heavens be no more?' Job xiv. 12. The anſwer is,
<list>
                        <item>1. That <hi>man</hi> here may mean, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the greateſt part of mankind, as it does in ſome other ſcriptures.</item>
                        <item>2. At the next con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration the preſent ſtate of the aerial heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, as may preſently be ſhewn, will, in ſome manner, paſs away.</item>
                        <item>3. Suppoſe any of the Jews in Old Teſtament times had been of opinion that there would be a bodily reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection of <hi>many</hi> ſaints at the end of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, and conſequently before the final ruin of the globe;</item>
                     </list> this objection would have been as forcible againſt that opinion, as it is now againſt the opinion that many more ſaints will riſe at the end of our diſpenſation. So when Chriſt declared, John v. 28, 29, 'The hour is coming when <hi>all</hi> that are in their graves ſhall hear his voice, and come forth,' his words would <hi>then</hi> as fairly have proved that no ſaint would riſe when he aroſe; as they will now prove that no ſaint will riſe at the time of the firſt reſurrection. The word <hi>hour</hi> is ſometimes uſed for time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely. The ten horns received power as
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032007_0090_0FF09EEA529EB170"/>kings '<hi>one hour</hi> with the beaſt.' i. e. <hi>at one time</hi> with the beaſt. Rev. xvii. 12. So here 'the <hi>hour</hi> is coming:' the <hi>time</hi> is coming, when all the dead ſhall be alive. And it may be that the general reſurrection <hi>will</hi> be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in one hour.</p>
                  <p>The objection taken from Matt. xxv. 30 to 46 muſt vaniſh, when it is conſidered that it does not there appear to have been our Saviour's deſign to meaſure periods, but only in general to ſhow what a ſolemn diſtinction between the righteous and the wicked will be the conſequence of his ſecond coming. We ſhould alſo remember, that 'one day is with the Lord as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day.'</p>
                  <p>When we read too that in Dan. xii. 2, it ſeems as if all would be raiſed at the ſame time. 'And many of them who ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contempt.' But even here the revival of the righteous is mentioned firſt, as it is in every other text where both are mentioned together, which affords prevailing evidence that the reſurrection of the righteous will be firſt in the order of time. But how long firſt? Daniel's prophecy here does not ſay; but the Revelation ſays it will be a whole day firſt: and the Revelation is exegetical of the book of Daniel. "As the prophets often ſpeak of things future as if they were already effected," ſays Dr. Newton, "ſo
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032007_0091_0FF09EE41EA4E4F8"/>they often ſpeak of things to be brought about in proceſs of time, as if they were to ſucceed immediately; paſt, preſent and to come being all alike known to an infinite mind, and the intermediate time not revealed perhaps to the minds of the prophets."<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſſertation on the Prophecies, Vol. 1. p. 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>INFERENCES.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence it appears that the Millennium is yet future. There has been no corporeal reſurrection ſince this prophecy was revealed. The capture of Conſtantinople by Mahomet the Second, in the year 1453, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent ruin of the Greek empire, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to ſome expoſitors like Satan let looſe to deceive the nations. Hence their Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium begins in the year 453. But what was the condition and behaviour of mankind in that intermediate time? Are they diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in genuine hiſtory from other ages by knowledge, piety, peace and happineſs? Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more remote. Who without pain can read the miſeries of our fellow creatures in the fifth and ſixth centuries by the fall of the weſtern empire, when the Barbarians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compaſſion to age or ſex, carried fire and ſword, maſſacre and deſperation among the people wherever they went? What vaſt deſolation afflicted the world in the ſeventh and eighth centuries, by the conqueſt of the Saracens extending far and wide; from It<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aly to the river Niger, in Africa; from Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032007_0092_0FF09EED30BF4750"/>to the remoteſt Indies. Before them was the garden of the Lord; behind them a deſolate wilderneſs. And what were the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries, but the midnight of Popiſh deluſion? Then, if ever, the man of ſin ſat in the temple of God, and the houſe of prayer became a den of thieves. The twelfth, thirteenth and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth centuries are well known to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the moſt extenſive and bloody perſecutions of the Petrobruſſians, Waldenſes, and Lollards, that ever diſgraced the human nature. "It is enough to make the blood run cold to read of the horrid murders and devaſtations of theſe times! how many poor innocent Chriſtians were ſacrificed to the blind fury and malice of their enemies! It is computed that in France alone were ſlain a million." While the ſword of the fierce Othman (horrid argument) was propagating a falſe religion by pouring blood and devaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation through the eaſtern empire. What melancholy ages were theſe! What kind of reign upon earth had the ſaints in this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Millennium! And what matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is, than men eminent for knowledge in divinity and hiſtory, ſhould ever attempt to vindicate this hypotheſis! A clear manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how neceſſary it is that the mind ſhould be influenced, not by great names, but great arguments, in all our inquiries for the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of prophecy, as well as every other part of the ſacred ſcriptures.</p>

2. The firſt reſurrection will not be merely that of the martyrs, as ſome have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but of others who have not worſhipped the beaſt. The propriety of mentioning the martyrs here <hi>expreſsly</hi> is eaſy to be ſeen. Other ſaints in general are not in ſuch pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar need of comfort from this promiſe as the martyrs were. And perhaps too the reign of the martyrs will be, in ſome reſpects, more glorious than that of moſt other ſaints. But there is evidence that many and perhaps all the ſaints who ſhall then have lived, will have a part in the firſt reſurrection: for then Chriſt will appear in the clouds, as already ſhewn; and 'When Chriſt, who is our life, ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,' ſays Paul, 'then ſhall <hi>ye</hi> alſo appear with him in glory;' that is, in a ſtate of glory in the clouds; 'and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.' Chriſt will come with all his ſaints; 'He will then ſend his angels with a great ſound of a trumpet, and they ſhall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.' Matt. xxiv. 31. And when Paul treats of the firſt reſurrection, he ſays, 'We ſhall <hi>all</hi> be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump (for the trumpet ſhall ſound) and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible, and we ſhall be changed.'</p>
                  <p>But when we conſider how numerous mankind will be in the Millennium, it may may be aſked, How will there be room on the globe for ſuch a multitude of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032007_0094_0FF09EE1EDFEEED0"/>bodies? But he who is able to raiſe theſe bodies is doubtleſs able to find room for them. Many of them may be employed alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in other parts of the univerſe, and open ſuch opulent ſources of communication from the numerous iſlands of the ethereal ocean, as will cauſe the next diſpenſation as much to exceed the preſent with reſpect to knowledge, as the preſent exceeds the former. Many of them too may aſcend to the third heaven, and there live for a time, while thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he who can raiſe the dead, can ſay to the deep, Be dry. Though the prophecy of the new earth has ultimate reference to that moſt glorious ſtate of the church which ſhall ſucceed the Millennium; yet many of the beſt commentators allow, it will be fulfilled in part when that happy period ſhall corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence. Therefore that in Hag. ii. 6, and Rev. xxi. 1, may is part be fulfilled literally, as well as myſtically, for any thing which yet appears to the contrary. And if only one third part of the ſea ſhould become land, it would furniſh nearly as much room for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants as there now is on the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the globe.<note n="*" place="bottom">To what purpoſe are all the arguments from the laws of nature in oppoſition to the doctrine of the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

3. Hence it appears agreeable to the ultimate deſign of this whole chapter, that the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium will be a third general diſpenſation of grace, a new order of things with reſpect to the church militant, as diſtinct from the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as the preſent is from that of the Jews. It has now been ſhewn, that the firſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection will be attended with Chriſt's perſonal appearance in flaming fire, and the inference is neceſſary that there will be a miraculous manifeſtation of things which were never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exhibited to the world. But more will be offered to confirm this in the next chapter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hence it is probable, that the thouſand years will only be literally ſuch. The firſt and ſecond reſurrection, with the chapter in general, have a literal meaning, as already has been ſhewn. Therefore the thouſand years, other things being equal, muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as having the ſame acceptation. Three hundred and ſixty-five thouſand years are out of all proportion, as Dr. Hopkins has juſtly obſerved.</p>
                  <p>The week of days and the week of years, among the Jews, are allowed to be analogous to the duration of the globe; but the ſeventh day is no longer than any other day of the week.</p>
                  <p>The firſt diſpenſation continued four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years; the ſecond two thouſand nearly. Therefore the third diſpenſation, continuing only one thouſand years, has the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the ſecond as the ſecond has to the firſt: As two are to four, ſo is one to two.</p>

In that day it is allowed, that the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſaints will have far greater degrees of holineſs than the imperfect ſaints have at preſent, or ever had heretofore. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſin and its conſequences will appear far more dreadful to them than they appear now to us. And hence their deſires and prayers will be earneſt for that far more glorious ſtate of the church beyond them, in which the prediction of the new heavens and earth will have its complete accompliſhment, and in which the whole church, collected from all ages and nations, ſhall appear without ſpot or wrinkle; ſin, ſorrow and death being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely baniſhed forever.</p>
                  <p>Theſe conſiderations muſt afford ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of evidence that the Millennium, though a very bright and glorious day, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, and that it is not a thing deſirable, on the whole, that it ſhould continue longer than literally a thouſand years.</p>
                  <p>When any particular ſaint enjoys the lively exerciſe of grace, he is far more happy than he was before; yet he forgets the things which are behind, and the future perfect day is more earneſtly deſired than cover: So it will be with the church militant in the Millenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um. Her deſires for the perfect day will be more earneſt than ever before in any former age. Therefore, comparing future time with the paſt, it does not appear rational to imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine that three hundred and ſixty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years will be ſuffered to elapſe before theſe earneſt deſires ſhall be gratified.</p>

                  <p>THOUGH nothing will ever be added to the ſcripture ſubſtantially different from what is now revealed; yet the propoſition in view is the neceſſary inference from the preceding chapter, and confirmed by ſeveral other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The diſtinction between the preſent and former diſpenſation, chiefly conſiſts in our having a new and more glorious revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which abrogates the old poſitive inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, beſides affording new diſcoveries,

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> more obſcurely revealed before. As much diſtinction and a ſimilar one there will be, we may rationally ſuppoſe, between our diſpenſation and the Millennium: for it is not improbable that our poſitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions will be then aboliſhed: We have not the leaſt evidence that baptiſm will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer than to the end of <hi>this</hi> world. Matt. xxviii. 20. Nor that the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will continue any longer than till the coming of Chriſt. 1 Cor. xi. 26. And what neceſſity will there be of ſuch a token to keep in memory an abſent Friend when he ſhall be preſent?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will not he denied that ſeveral an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient prophecies do, in the ſame ſentences, predict both the preſent diſpenſation and the Millennium, and the former as the type of the latter. And the propriety of viewing them in this light plainly appears by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim. 4. Thoſe prophecies could afford no more evidence to the Jews that their diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation would be ſucceeded by another, than they now afford that our diſpenſation will be ſucceeded by another. We have ſeen what their fulfilment was in the type, and hence may infer that their fulfilment will be ſimilar in the antitype.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Under the Jewiſh economy the ark of the teſtament was placed in the inner taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, <hi>never to be ſeen</hi> by any one, except the high prieſt, through that diſpenſation. 'The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying,' ſays Paul, 'that
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032007_0099_0FF09F4BAACA0A60"/>the way into the holieſt of all was not yet made manifeſt, while as the firſt tabernacle was yet ſtanding;' that is, while that old diſpenſation remained. Therefore, to open or make manifeſt the way into the holy of holies, and conſequently to bring the ark of the teſtament into view, required a new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. Heb. ix. 1—10. Hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that for any prophet to predict that the ark of the teſtament <hi>ſhall be ſeen,</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly the ſame as to predict a new diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But when the ſeventh angel ſounded, there were great voices in heaven, ſaying, 'The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt. And the temple of God was opened in heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; <hi>and there was ſeen</hi> in his temple the ark of his teſtament.' What is this ſudden ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the ark of the teſtament, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed for ages, but a figure ſignificant of a new revelation?<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſeventh of the laſt plagues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s allowed to ſynchronize with the ſeventh trumpet; but when John had ſeen theſe plagues, he looked, and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in heaven was opened. Rev. xv. 5. This is undoubtedly the ſame as that in Rev. xi. 19; and hence it is plain that the latter ought to ſtand where it is placed, under the ſeventh trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Not to introduce a new chapter and ſubject, as ſome expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itors have imagined.</note> The ark of the teſtament contained the glories of law and goſpel. The ſame is predicable of the Old Teſtament, the New Teſtament, and the future revelation.<note n="†" place="bottom">The judgment was ſet and <hi>the books</hi> were opened, Dan. vii. 10. At the firſt coming of Chriſt the books of the Old Teſtament were opened by a new revelation; ſo at his ſecond coming the books of both Teſtaments will be opened by a new revelation.</note>

4. Then doubtleſs, and not till then, will be known what the ſeven thunders uttered. If we compare Rev. x. 1—7, with Dan. xii. 6—9, we ſhall plainly perceive that of John and that of Daniel to be ſimilar viſions. Now, as the ſealed words which Daniel did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand were not explained but by another revelation in a new diſpenſation; ſo we have no reaſon to expect that the ſealed voices of the ſeven thunders will be explained but by another revelation in a new diſpenſation. And as the former <hi>were</hi> explained by the opening of the ſeven ſeals; ſo we have reaſon to expect that the latter will be explained by the next revelation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It will not be denied that every part of the Bible is given for the benefit of the church militant in ſome age or other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is highly reaſonable to expect that the whole of it will be underſtood before the final judgment. But how is all this knowledge to be attained without extraordinary aſſiſtance? What poor, dark apprehenſions had the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Iſraelites of their own Bible, till Chriſt explained it by another at his firſt coming! And how will both theſe now be perfectly underſtood without the third volume at his ſecond coming? What a large and valuable portion of ſcripture is yet under a veil, which the moſt elaborate, ingenious and learned commentaries have never taken off! How will thoſe prophecies, the ſolution of which depends on the knowledge of ſome ancient
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032007_0101_0FF09F28B44E6568"/>hieroglyphics, be ever perfectly underſtood without miraculous inſtruction? But if we ſuppoſe that the revived ſaints will remember the events of their former life, as all acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge who believe the reſurrection; it is eaſy to ſee how this knowledge may be revived, and this part of ſcripture be known as well as the reſt. And it is not improbable that the hiſtory of all preceding ages may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and made ſacred by this divine inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as that of Moſes was from the beginning to his own time.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that though the eſſentials of religion will be always the ſame, there will yet be another revelation, and probably (as human memory will then be finite) <hi>a record,</hi> diſtinct from the preſent with reſpect to precept, prophecy and hiſtory. And without doubt it will be far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit and glorious than the preſent revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; more immediately and far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively known, ſo that the feeble ſhall be as David, and the houſe of David as God; and the nations of them who are ſaved will ſo walk in the light of New Jeruſalem, as they never did before.</p>
                  <p>The general events of our diſpenſation are predicted by the opening of ſeals and the ſounding of trumpets; (when a ſeal is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, none but readers can immediately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſubject.) But the next prophetic revelation is repreſented as being uttered by articulate thunder, which much more than a
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:032007_0102_0FF09F3290DFABF0"/>trumpet will ſound inſtruction far and wide. Multitudes will hear it at once; a nation born in a day. Thunder is the voice of God, loud and ſolemn. It is the God of Glory who thundereth. It is Chriſt who will teach the nations more clearly and gloriouſly than ever before; though probably not without the miniſtry of infallible ſaints. This inſtruction will be ſo clearly underſtood as to harmonize the whole church militant; all will ſee eye to eye.<note n="*" place="bottom">How illuſtriouſly the wiſdom of God ſhines forth in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the church, now juſt before the Millennium, to be afflicted with a great diverſity of opinion, ſchiſm and ſeparation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the increaſe of knowledge, and the greateſt pains uſed for reconciliation by the wiſe, the pious and the charitable: Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the delightful contraſt will appear, and a far greater beauty than if ſuch differences had never exiſted.</note> Truth publiſhed by thunder will make ſwift progreſs, and the knowledge of the Lord will fill the earth as the waters cover the ſeas.</p>

                  <p>WHEN the apoſtle Peter had finiſhed his ſolemn deſcription of the conflagration, he comforts believers with the promiſe of new heavens and a new earth. 2 Pet. iii. 13. 'Nevertheleſs we, according to his promiſe, look for new heavens and a new earth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dwelleth righteouſneſs.' Whatever ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032007_0103_0FF09F2A9365B6A8"/>bleſſings theſe words, by having a double reference, may preſignify, the literal ſenſe of them muſt not be excluded. That word of prophecy, which is like ſilver ſeven times tried, is not only fulfilled in different periods, but ſometimes in different ſenſes. 'The deſart ſhall rejoice and bloſſom as the roſe.' Iſa. xxxv. 4. 'I will give—to thy ſeed—the land of Canaan.' Gen. xvii. 8. Theſe and ſeveral other paſſages ſeem to have a literal as well as ſpiritual fulfillment. The ſame may be obſerved of the firſt prophecy after the apoſtaſy reſpecting the enmity between the ſeed of the woman and the ſeed of the ſerpent: It is now as clearly fulfilled in the literal as in the ſpiritual ſenſe. Therefore, if it were proved that the above promiſe of a new world has a ſpiritual aſpect, it would by no means follow that there will not be alſo a literal fulfilment of it.</p>
                  <p>As God is one, ſo his works are one. A glorious uniformity of deſign is conſpicuous through the whole of them. It is a great beauty in the works of our Creator, that, amidſt all their variety, one ſpecies, of created exiſtence repreſents another, and one period of events repreſents another. Hence <hi>the much in a little</hi> of the word of prophecy. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the preſent ſtate of the natural world reſembles that of the moral. Now what great abſurdity is there in ſuppoſing that the works of the ſame God will in future time be ſimilar to what they have been in time
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032007_0104_0FF09F23F05C8610"/>paſt? that the future ſtate of the moral world will be repreſented by the future ſtate of the natural? that as, by what has been proved, there will be a great miraculous change for the better in the moral world, ſo there will be the like in the natural? Why is the renovation of the earth after its ruin any more incredible than the renovation of our own earth after the ruin of our bodies? Why then may not the above promiſe mean as it ſpeaks; eſpecially ſince it is a maxim with divines, that the literal ſenſe ſhould always be preferred to the figurative, when it does not oppoſe the analogy of faith.</p>
                  <p>It is proved that the former part of this chapter treats of a literal deluge and a literal conflagration. And now when it treats of a new earth, muſt another ſubject preſent it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to view all at once, or a moſt unnatural tranſition from the literal to the figurative? Certainly not without ſome better reaſon than the ſupport of that hypotheſis, which has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been ſhewn to be erroneous.<note n="*" place="bottom">"The general rule of interpretation is not to recede from the literal ſenſe unleſs there be a neceſſity from the ſubject matter. But where is that neceſſity in this caſe? Cannot God make new heavens and earth as eaſily as he made the old ones? Is his ſtrength decayed? I be ſecond rule is the uſe of the ſame words in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text. Saint Peter had uſed the ſame phraſe of heavens and earth twice before in the ſame chap <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>: and now he uſes it again, verſe 13. The new heavens and earth. Have we not then reaſon to ſuppoſe that he takes it here in the ſame ſenſe that he had done twice before, for real, material heavens and earth? There is no mark ſet of a new lignification, nor why were ſhould alter the ſenſe of the words. The very form of the words and the manner of their dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the context, lead us to a literal ſenſe: 'Nevertheleſs,' ſays the apoſtle, '<hi>we expect new heavens,</hi>' &amp;c. Why nevertheleſs? i. e. notwithſtanding the diſſolution of the preſent heavens and earth. The apoſtle foreſaw that what he had ſaid might raiſe a doubt in their minds whether all things would not be at an end; to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate this he tells them, <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> that wonderful deſolation that I have deſcribed, we do, according to God's promiſe, expect new heavens and a new earth. You ſee then that the new heavens and new earth are ſubſtituted in the place of thoſe that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And would you ſubſtitute allegorical heavens and earth in the place of material? what an equivocation would it be in the apoſtle, when the doubt was about the material heavens and earth, to make an anſwer about the allegorical?" —<hi>Dr. Burne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:032007_0105_0FF09F2C2B03D358"/>that the new earth only means the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant righteouſneſs of that day, is refuted by the very words of this promiſe, which plainly diſtinguiſh the new earth from the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ſhall dwell in it. 'We look for new heavens and a new earth <hi>wherein dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> righteouſneſs.' So in Iſa. lxvi. 22, the new heavens and earth are clearly diſtinguiſhed from the church which ſhall flouriſh in that day: 'As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, ſhall remain before me, ſo ſhall <hi>your ſeed and your name</hi> remain.' And in Rom. viii. 19, which by an emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal proſopopoeia repreſents the whole creation as waiting and groaning for this renovation, the ſame diſtinction is manifeſt. 'And not only <hi>they,</hi> but <hi>we ourſelves</hi> alſo, groan within ourſelves, waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of our body.'</p>
                  <p>Theſe paſſages plead for the literal ſenſe of this glorious prediction of the new heavens and earth. And how agreeable is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to what is known to be God's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working both in the natural and moral
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032007_0106_0FF097FA20562708"/>world. The moſt ſalubrious air, the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt ſun, the pureſt ſky, are often the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate conſequence of the moſt violent ſtorms. The preſent beautiful creation roſe from chaos. And in the moral world the greateſt good often ſucceeds the greateſt evil. 'In the place where it was ſaid, Ye are not my people, there ſhall they be called, The children of the living God.' So this part of the creation which, is now ſubject to vanity and the curſe, and reſerved unto fire againſt the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men, it is not unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, will thenceforward be the ſubject of reſtitution and the moſt glorious exhibitions of mercy. But, though the aerial heavens in that time may become much more ſalutary and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of longevity than ever before over all the globe, on which account, as well as on account of the new ſtate of things in general, the whole globe may be ſaid to be new; yet there is no difficulty in the hypotheſis that the next reſtitution will be only partial, only the commencement of that which ſhall be complete at the final judgment. The curſe which afflicts the earth for man's ſake, ſeems to have had two periods of fulfilment; the firſt immediately after the apoſtaſy; the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond at the deluge. For though Dr. Burnet's theory, as ſuch, cannot agree with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet in this matter his reaſoning is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of particular notice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="83" facs="unknown:032007_0107_0FF09F4550EDB1C8"/>
The new ſpiritual creation has two periods of accompliſhment: The firſt, that of regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration; the ſecond, that of perfection. And the human ſoul in the intermediate time is the ſubject of the wideſt extremes. It has been proved too, that the prophecies of Gog and Magog—of the reſurrection and confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration —have yet two periods of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>When all theſe things are conſidered, we are not without evidence that there muſt be a ſecond period to fulfil all the happineſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted of the new heavens and earth.</p>
                  <p>What this new earth will be, we know not any more than we know what our bodies will be; but doubtleſs a glorified earth will be a ſuitable manſion for glorified bodies, and conſequently for that New Jeruſalem which ſhall come down from God out of heaven.</p>
                  <p>This new earth will be the land of Iſrael, the antitype of Canaan, and a moſt glorious fulfilment of the promiſe to Abraham, 'that he ſhould be heir of the world through the righteouſneſs of faith.' This will be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the meek, Matt. v. 5; and of thoſe children who obey their parents in the Lord, Eph. vi. 1—3, and thereby become the true children of Abraham. The apoſtle, to encourage the true obedience of children, inſtead of the type, preſents to their view the antitype; inſtead of ſaying, 'Thy days ſhall be long upon the land,' he ſays, 'Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the firſt
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032007_0108_0FF09F37268AB300"/>commandment with promiſe, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayeſt live long on the earth.' Not the preſent earth: for here obedient children in general live no longer than others; but on the new earth, of which Abraham's ſpiritual children are heirs, and which is the antitype of the land given to obedient children by the fifth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
                  <p>To this land of the ſpiritual Iſrael, it ſeems, Rachel's children will return, thoſe babes of Bethlehem, who were ſlain by the cruelty of Herod. The thirty firſt chapter of Jeremiah contains a prophecy of the Millennium, or of the next diſpenſation, as well as this; and in verſe 15, 16, 17, we have theſe words—'A voice was heard in Rama, lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children, refuſed to be comforted for her children, becauſe they are not. Thus ſaith the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work ſhall be rewarded, and they ſhall come again from the land of the enemy, and there is hope in thine end, ſaith the Lord, that thy children ſhall come again to their own bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.' The ſame pious parents in Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem, whoſe affliction is here predicted, are here exhorted to patience and reſignation, and are comforted too with the glorious prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe that their children ſhall return to their own borders, i. e. to the antitype of their own bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. They ſhall come again from the land
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032007_0109_0FF09F4FD38A3668"/>of the enemy, a land of which Babylon was a reſemblance, and which the ſcripture elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where calls the land of darkneſs and the ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow of death: For death, we know, is the great enemy of the ſaints through all ages, and the laſt enemy which ſhall be deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>The New Teſtament prophecy, which is the greateſt expoſitor of the Old, knows of no other land of Iſrael below the third heaven but the new earth. This then will be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, the heaven begun below, of the ſpiritual Iſrael, whether they be Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. On this part of the globe, where ſin and miſery have abounded, holineſs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs will much more abound. The vileſt of ſinners once inhabited Canaan; but the Lord caſt them out before the children of Iſrael. And the city of the Jebuſites became the city of David, and the place which the Lord choſe to put his name there.</p>

                  <p>ANOTHER great event which will ſerve to conſtitute the glory of the Millennium, is the ſalvation of the Jews. That they will yet embrace the Chriſtian faith is very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſt, not only from ſeveral paſſages in the

Jer. iii. 14. Ezek. xxxvi. 37. and ſeveral other paſſages.</p>
                  <p>Though infidelity and all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs will doubtleſs continue to prevail among us to the end; yet, from what has been ſhewn, we may expect that, by remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able revivals here and there, God will call in his elect at different times, till at length the Jews will embrace the truth as it is in Jeſus. And when theſe natural branches ſhall be graffed in again, the wild olive branches ſhall be broken off. As the Jews in general were given over to infidelity and falſe religion when we were converted; ſo the Chriſtians in general will be given over to infidelity and falſe religion when the Jews ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.<note n="*" place="bottom">And yet their converſion will be as life from the dead to the greateſt part of mankind: For Chriſtendom is but ſmall part of the globe.</note> This appears not only by Chap II. Sect. 2 and 3; but by Rom. xi. 18—22 'Boaſt not againſt the branches; thou ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by faith: Be not high-minded, but fear: For if God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed leſt lie alſo ſpare not thee. Behold
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:032007_0111_0FF097F3816A9C20"/>therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God! on them which fell, ſeverity; but toward thee, goodneſs, <hi>if thou continue in his goodneſs; otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The injurious treatment which the Jews have received from the Chriſtians, and from that church in particular to whom this epiſtle was directed, plainly manifeſts how neceſſary this admonition was. The Gentile Chriſtians in general have not continued in that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God which has ſo wonderfully diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them from the Jews. They have been high-minded, and boaſted againſt the natural branches. Inſtead of pitying them, and uſing the beſt means for removing their prejudices, we have deſpiſed them, and in many inſtances not allowed them the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mom privilege of citizens. They have been a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curſe among us; yea, we have plundered and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them from age to age. What then are we to expect but the dreadful accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the above ſolemn threatening, that the greateſt part of the Chriſtian world will in that day be given over to infidelity and falſe religion, to hardneſs of heart and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind?</p>
                  <p>Hence alſo we may expect, that when the Jews ſhall become true believers, the Chriſtian Gentiles will become their enemies and furious perſecutors; and as, when the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles firſt believed, ſome Jews united with them ſo, when the Jews ſhall believe, ſome
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032007_0112_0FF09F47952C3E08"/>Chriſtians will probably unite with <hi>them,</hi> and all ſhall be in one ſheepfold, conſtitute one Iſrael, and have fellowship in the ſame ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
                  <p>Here will be the laſt perſecution of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, Gog and Magog; the battle of the great day of God Almighty. Vaſt mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of falſe, ſenſual and infidel Chriſtians, and perhaps Mahometans, will probably unite their efforts to extirpate the truth from the earth, and deſtroy a people brought back from the ſword of Rome heathen, and Rome Chriſtian, by the hand of Providence, which, perhaps ſhall then have given civil and relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious liberty to all that part of the globe, where the Jews are chiefly diſperſed. Againſt theſe ſierce perſecutors God will plead with peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and blood; and at laſt Chriſt will end the diſpute by his own perſonal appearance. Then the fiſhes and fowls and beaſts, and 'every creeping thing which creepeth upon the earth, and all the men who are upon the face of the earth, ſhall ſhake at his preſence,' while he ſhall rain upon that wretched mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude an overflowing rain, great hail-ſtones, ſire and brimſtone. 'Lo! he cometh in clouds, and every eye<note n="*" place="bottom">Many eyes at that time, and every eye ſooner or later.</note> ſhall ſee him, and <hi>they alſo which pierced him.</hi>' Before this they will ſee him with an eye of faith and mourn; now probably they will ſee him with bodily eyes and mourn, for their bodies will not be
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032007_0113_0FF09F62837E0B00"/>changed till after the reſurrection. Chriſt will firſt appear, then the dead ſhall riſe, and then the living ſaints will be changed. 1 Theſſ. iv. 16, 17. 'The Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt: Then we which are alive on the earth ſhall be caught up together in the clouds.' In this manner will the dead and living of the true Iſrael be gathered from the four winds and be brought into their own land, that is, into the new earth, the glorious antitype of ancient Canaan. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the dead, as well as the living, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a promiſe, that they ſhall return into the land of Iſrael. Iſa. xxxv. 10. 'The ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return and come to Zion with ſongs, and everlaſting joy ſhail be upon their heads; they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away.' But ſorrow and ſighing will not flee away till the reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>A like promiſe we have in Ezek. xxxvii. one deſign of which was particularly to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort thoſe pious Jews, who, by reaſon of the Babyloniſh captivity and that of Salmanezer, were in a ſtate of deſpondency, and ſaid, Our hope is loſt, our bones are dry, we are cut off for <hi>our parts;</hi> q. d. the captivity will indeed return after ſeventy years; but as for us, <hi>we</hi> ſhall never live to return. Our bones will be dead and dry long before that happy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. Ah! but you ſhall return, ſaith the Lord; 'Behold! O my people, I will open
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032007_0114_0FF09F397081F418"/>your graves, and cauſe you to come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of Iſrael,<note n="*" place="bottom">That nothing may <hi>ſeem</hi> to fail which the Lord has promiſed, the <hi>Jews may poſſibly</hi> before ſunriſe reſettle their old land, and there ſuffer great perſecution from their enemies. When the Jews re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Babylon, the prophecies which predicted their return, were fulfilled; yet all agree that their ultimate fulfilment was an object far more extenſive and glorious. However, there ſeems to be no prophecy of ſuch a literal return in the New Teſtament.</note> and ye ſhall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves. <hi>Then ſhall ye know</hi> that I the Lord have ſpoken and performed it, ſaith the Lord;' which ſtrongly intimates, that they ſhould not know before the very important and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſignification of this prophecy.</p>
                  <p>That this is not a ſpiritual reſurrection, as many have ſuppoſed, muſt be evident by the following arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is allowed by Dr. Hopkins to be a good argument that the Millennium will be literally a thouſand years, that the prophecy repeats that number of years ſeveral times. As well may it be argued that the reſurrection now in view will be literal, becauſe it is ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral times declared that God will 'open their graves and bring them up out of their graves.'</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Regeneration in another part of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though it is ſometimes called a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is no where expreſſed by <hi>opening the grave</hi> or <hi>coming up out of the grave.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any perſon or perſons are ſpoken of as <hi>coming up</hi> or <hi>brought up from the grave,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:032007_0115_0FF09F3B00A78E88"/>reſurrection is always intended. When a perſon is regenerated, he is ſaid in ſcripture language to live or riſe from the dead; but never to come forth from the grave. Both kinds of reſurrection are mentioned by our Lord in the ſame diſcourſe. John v. 25, 28, 29. This is univerſally acknowledged; and ſee how he expreſſes himſelf in order to be underſtood: 'Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, The hour is coming and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall <hi>live.</hi>' This is the ſpiritual reſurrection. 'Marvel not at this; the hour is coming in the which all that are <hi>in the graves</hi> ſhall hear his voice, and <hi>come forth;</hi> they who have done good unto the reſurrection of life, and they who have done evil unto the reſurrection of damnation.' Here Chriſt plainly means the corporeal reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection, and his manner of expreſſion is juſt like that of the prophet in the paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though this prophecy refers to the whole ſpiritual Iſrael, it is evident that one ſpecial deſign of it was to comfort thoſe pious captives, who ſaid, Our hope is loſt, we are <hi>cut off</hi> for <hi>our parts,</hi> and to convince them that <hi>their</hi> hope was <hi>not</hi> loſt, and that they were <hi>not</hi> wholly cut off for <hi>their parts.</hi> But if only a ſpiritual reſurrection is here intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the prophecy leaves them as it finds them, without any more hope, as to <hi>their own caſe,</hi> than they had before. For the prophet only
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032007_0116_0FF09F6C81ABA490"/>to tell theſe captives that there will be a great reformation among mankind ſome time or other, was certainly not the moſt direct meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od to convince them that <hi>their</hi> hope was not loſt and that <hi>they</hi> were not cut off <hi>for their parts.</hi> But if this prediction be literal, it ſpeaks directly to their caſe, and is full of conſolation for thoſe who were to die in that grievous captivity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This chapter is evidently parallel with the xxth. of Revelation. Both chapters predict the reſurrection of God's people. Both have a ſimilar deſign. Both are intended to give conſolation to perſons in a ſimilar condition. The former to comfort thoſe who died in the captivity of Affyria and Babylon; the latter to comfort thoſe who died in myſtical Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. And as, in the book of Ezekiel, the prophecy of Gog and Magog is next in order to that of the reſurrection and David's reign over the land of Iſrael; ſo, in the book of Revelation, the prophecy of Gog and Magog is next in order to, that of the reſurrection and Chriſt's reign over the new earth. Theſe conſiderations afford evidence that the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Ezekiel here foretels the very ſame reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection as that in the xxth. of Revelation. And as the latter has already been ſhewn to be literal in Chap. II. Sect. 4, it is certainly moſt rational to underſtand the former in the ſame light.<note n="*" place="bottom">Ezekiel in the prophecy of Gog and Magog has in view the type and antitype; but John only the antitype.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="unknown:032007_0117_0FF09F66B38358F0"/>
The prophet in the latter part of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeems to foretel the perfect union of God's people of Iſrael and Judah, and perhaps of Jews and Gentiles, as their antitype; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by two ſticks, which became one in his hand, that the glorious church, thus unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhall have David for their king, and the land of Iſrael for their habitation; but here David is Chriſt, and conſequently the land of Iſrael muſt be the land of Chriſt, the new earth on which Chriſt will reign with his ſaints a thouſand years,</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears that, not the type, but the antitype; not the old Canaan in its preſent or former ſtate, but the New Canaan, far more excellent and glorious, is reſerved for the Jews, in common with other believers, when they ſhall have embraced the true Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah. That they ſhould have no better habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation than their ancient land through the Millennium, is too groſs a conception to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertian of goſpel glory or that of the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.<note n="*" place="bottom">The promiſe in Gen. xv. 18, which gave to Abraham all the land from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates, was doubtleſs fulfilled in the days of Solomon. 2 Chron. ix. 26.</note> If not, it is ſtrange that we find no particular account of it in the New Teſtament, and eſpecially in the book of Revelation, where it might be ſo naturally expected.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Old Teſtament prophecies which have been ſuppoſed to predict the return of the Jews to their old land do as plainly predict the return of their ancient ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032007_0118_0FF09F3E37A86DA8"/>worſhip; the ſanctuary, ſacrifice, taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, new moons, appointed feaſts, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid for their king. Therefore we have juſt as much evidence from the Old Teſtament that the Jews will return to their ancient economy, as that they will return to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient country to dwell there through the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium, in the manner ſo commonly imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined. Some better thing is doubtleſs provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that poor, ſtupid, and puniſhed people, who are ſtill beloved for the fathers' ſakes. A better worſhip, a better country, and a far more glorious accompliſhment of the promiſe made to Abraham.</p>
                  <p>INFERENCES.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence it appears probable, that the true goſpel church at the coming of Chriſt will conſiſt chiefly of Jews. Their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will afford another important argument in favour of divine revelation; but the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian infidels will not regard it at all. The Bible will ſtill be ridiculed, and the doctrine of Chriſt's coming in particular. And many of thoſe who ſhall believe it, will conſider it far diſtant, and place it beyond the Millennium. Though the knowledge of ſcripture among the pious will be greatly increaſed, as well as every other branch of knowledge in the world, ſtill 'the wicked ſhall do wickedly, and none of them ſhall underſtand; but the wiſe ſhall underſtand.' The Jews ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and ſhall look for Chriſt's coming:
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032007_0119_0FF09F49F5315328"/>for unto them who look for him ſhall he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion They ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he who co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the name of the Lord. Agreeable to that in Matt. xxiii. 39, 'Ye ſhall not ſee me henceforth till ye ſhall ſay, Bleſſed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord.'</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence, perhaps, we may find what is, intended by the fulneſs of the Jews and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gentiles, Rom. xi. 12 and 25. The fulneſs of the Jews muſt be the fulneſs of the elect among the Jews. This will read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily be granted. And the fulneſs of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles muſt in this verſe ſignify the fulneſs of the elect among <hi>our Chriſtian and Mahometan Gentiles,</hi> and not among the millennial Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as ſome might imagine: For 'blindneſs in part,' ſay, Paul, 'is happened to Iſrael, until the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in.'<note n="*" place="bottom">"It cannot be denied but that ſome of Paul's expreſſions are like unto what is in Luke's goſpel, and why may not this allude to that in Luke xxi. 24? 'Jeruſalem ſhall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled,' i. e. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the times be fulfilled when the fourth monarchy ſhall come to its ruin. See a like phraſe Jer. xxvii. 7. When the four mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archies of the Gentiles are finiſhed, then ends the time of the Gentiles,"—<hi>Mather's Doctrine of the Jews' Conv. Chap.</hi> 2.</note> But this blindneſs in part, it is allowed, will continue no longer than till about the time when the Millennium ſhall commence, and conſequently this fulneſs of the Gentiles will take place about the ſame time; but ſurely the fulneſs of all the nations on the globe will not take place till a thouſand years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. Our Lord predicted that Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032007_0120_0FF09F5398E71388"/>ſhould be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. Luke xxi. 24. The times of the Gentiles will be fulfilled 'when time ſhall be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;' that is, when our Chriſtian day of grace ſhall be finiſhed, and conſequently when the fulneſs of our Gentiles ſhall come in, and not when the thouſand years ſhall be finiſhed: For then Jeruſalem would be trodden down of the Gentiles through the thouſand years, which all deny who either maintain or oppoſe the millenarian doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Here then is another proof that the fulneſs of the Gentiles in the above paſſage is the fulneſs of <hi>our</hi> Gentiles, who enjoy the preſent goſpel diſpenſation. The elect number of the Jews and of the Chriſtian Gentiles will of the ungodly will be conſigned to ruin. And yet the fulneſs of the Jews will be the riches of the Gentiles and life from the dead to the Gentiles. Becauſe, not only will the ſalvation of <hi>our</hi> elect Gentiles be then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, but this event will be followed by the converſion of all the Pagan Gentiles to a far more glorious goſpel than was ever enjoyed in any preceding age of the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How often ſhould the converſion of the Jews be the ſubject of prayer! It is our indiſpenſable duty to pray for all men now living, if peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth. Paul prayed for the Jews even after
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:032007_0121_0FF09F55A66C74D0"/>they were rejected: 'My heart's deſire,' he ſays, 'and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they may be ſaved.' But at the preſent time the ſaints have peculiar encouragement to pray for their converſion. It is a glorious even ſwiftly approaching. From what has been obſerved, it muſt precede the coming of Chriſt, and may be expected within a few years. Before Chriſt's coming they will ſay, 'Bleſſed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord;' but they will not ſay this before their converſion.</p>
                  <p>We now ſee the dawn of the Millennium; a day neither clear nor dark, and deluſion and wickedneſs will make it ſtill darker. 'But it ſhall come to paſs, that at the evening time it ſhall be light;<note n="*" place="bottom">There was dawn of our diſpenſation before ſunriſe; a day among the Jews neither clear nor dark, by John's miniſtry and that of our Saviour. With the Jews, by reaſon of infidelity and hypocriſy, the day grew more and more dark; and when it was quite evening with them, ſuch a glorious light ſhone upon another people, as never was ſeen before. Then was fulfilled that in Zech. xiv. 6, 7. The ſame production now begins to have a ſecondary accompliſhment: the dawn of the next diſpenſation viſiting us before the ſecond appearance of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, ſince mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes who bear the name of Chriſtians, muſt and will reject the power and purity of the goſpel, how joyfully, how thankfully ſhould every true ſaint embrace the encouragement in favour of the Jews which the promiſes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and improve it by frequent and fervent prayer for their ſpeedy reformation; that the veil may be removed from their heart, while
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032007_0122_0FF09F40337DD6C8"/>Moſes is read before them; that they may truly accept of the puniſhment of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, which divine juſtice has inflicted upon them for ſo many ages, that ſo the true peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, Jews and Gentiles, may conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute one goſpel church, and dwell together in the glorious land of the ſpiritual Iſrael. But from hence it muſt not be inferred that we ſhould not pray for the Chriſtian nations; the plan of this ſubject is entirely conſiſtent with very great reformations in the Chriſtian world. And the preſent Concert in Prayer affords encouragement that the Lord is about to pour out his Spirit upon us, and that he will ſoon fill the whole earth with his glory. But 'by terrible things in righteouſneſs wilt thou anſwer us, O God of our ſalvation.'</p>

                  <p>THE doctrine of Chriſt's perſonal reign with his ſaints on the earth is the neceſſary inference from the preceding reaſoning, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that in Sect. 2 and 4, of Chap. II. All who maintain that Chriſt will appear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally when the thouſand years ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and that the firſt reſurrection will be corporeal, freely allow and believe that Chriſt's perſonal reign will be the happy conſequence.
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:032007_0123_0FF09F6E8E733030"/>It is acknowledged by all, that when Chriſt ſhall come to the earth, he will continue here till the long day of judgment ſhall be finiſhed; and that the ſaints will be raiſed and contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue here with him through all that time: And while they continue here, they will certainly reign here, as their triumphant ſong declares, Rev. v. 10. 'And haſt made us unto our God kings and prieſts, and we ſhall reign on the earth.' Therefore the ſame ſcriptures which prove that their reſurrection ſhall take place, and that Chriſt will perſonally appear when the Millennium ſhall commence, do necceſſarily prove their millennial reign.</p>
                  <p>But, ſince this doctrine is conſidered by many as very unreaſonable, it is neceſſary to take partitular notice of the arguments which are offered againſt it. There are ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral in Dr. Hopkins's Treatiſe on the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium; the conſideration of which, how much ſoever that excellent performance is to be eſteemed, cannot be omitted: One is taken from Col. iii. 4, 'When Chriſt who, is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory.' "Appearing with Chriſt in glory," ſays the Doctor, "means appearing with him in heaven, as that is the place of glory."<note n="*" place="bottom">Syſtem of Divinity, Vol. II. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But the earth will be the place of glory, it may be anſwered, 'when the Son of Man ſhall come in his glory,' and 'all the earth ſhall be filled with his glory.' The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor himſelf ſays, that "when Chriſt ſhall

But how then is it true, that when Chriſt ſhall appear, the ſaints ſhall appear with him in heaven?</p>
                  <p>To ſhow how contrary it is to all reaſon that Chriſt will come perſonally on the earth, the Doctor offers the following arguments:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. "He is in the moſt convenient and agreeable ſituation to govern the world and take care of his church."<note n="*" place="bottom">Treatiſe on the Millennium, p. 46—50.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he will be in the moſt convenient ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation for theſe purpoſes after his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which ſituation the Doctor allows, will be ſomewhere near the earth, and that for many thouſand years.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. "It does not appear agreeable to his ſtation and office, as King and Head over all things, for him to deſcend in the human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and erect a throne on earth, which, ſo far as can be conceived, would be no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his perſon, deſign, and work, but very much to the contrary."</p>
                  <p>And yet the Doctor ſays, that "Chriſt will deſcend and erect a throne ſomewhere near the earth, and may judge mankind here many thouſand years." And Job ſays, 'I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day <hi>upon</hi> the earths.' Where then is the difficulty of ſuppoſing that one of theſe many thouſand years will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for judging the living? Why is it
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032007_0125_0FF09F60706B5AF0"/>"contrary to all reaſon," that all nations ſhould enjoy a theocracy hereafter, any more than that one nation ſhould have enjoyed this kind of government heretofore? And why will it be a greater diſadvantage to Chriſt's perſon, deſign or work, for him to be a glorious King on the earth for a thouſand years, than it was for him to have been a poor ſervant on the earth for thirty years. Angels and the juſt made perfect, are now fully ſatisfied. that Chriſt is infinitely juſt and righteous; but when he ſhall have governed a world of nations for ſeveral ages without failing of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rectitude in a ſingle inſtance, how much more firmly will his character, as Judge, be eſtabliſhed in the view of all! How much more clearly and joyfully will the ſaints at laſt behold his qualifications for that infinitely ſolemn buſineſs which ſhall then follow, of judging the wicked and determining the final condition of the whole human race! How will the happy myriads ſhout with loud voices, 'Worthy is the Lamb who has reigned, to receive power and riches and wiſdom and ſtrength, and to reward every man according to his works:' (for in righteouſneſs hath he ruled the world) and juſtice and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto God, in his manner of working, has ever proceeded from inferior to ſuperior diſplays of his character.

When theſe things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, how will Chriſt's perſonal reign be any diſadvantage at all to his perſon, deſign or work? Some have conſidered the <hi>firſt</hi> coming of Chriſt as a great diſadvantage to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and of courſe have denied that there was ever ſuch an event; but the truth is, we are poorly able to determine, till Chriſt has told us, what is moſt for the advantage of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, deſign or work.</p>

Is it contrary to all reaſon, to ſuppoſe that the Millennium will be introduced in ſuch a manner that the excellency of it may moſt conſpicuouſly appear to be of God and not of man? The Moſaic economy was introduced by miraculous exhibitions of the divine preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and the Chriſtian diſpenſation by the miraculous preſence of God in the fleſh. Why then may not the next diſpenſation be introduced by the miraculous preſence of the ſame God in the clouds?</p>
                  <p>The ſun ſhall be confounded and the moon aſhamed when the Lord ſhall reign in Mount Zion before his ancients gloriouſly. That day will caſt a veil on all other days before it: there will be ſuch an earthquake, ſuch a rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution, as hath not been ſince men were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, 'ſo mighty an earthquake and ſo great.' Surely it cannot be contrary to all reaſon to imagine that this moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary of all changes which the world ever ſaw, will not be introduced merely by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſinful inſtruments in the common courſe of Providence; but in ſuch a manner as to give an eaſy conſtruction to that in Rev. xxi. 22.</p>
                  <p>The long ceſſation of miracles among the Jews before the <hi>firſt</hi> coming of Chriſt, was no proof that no more would ever be ſeen. And the long ceſſation of miracles among us, before his ſecond coming, is no proof that the greateſt miracles are not at hand that ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſurpriſed the world. That ſort of men who ridicule miracles never prevailed as they now do. Therefore will not a miracle, "a
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:032007_0131_0FF09F5E70393318"/>revelation written in the ſkies," ere long be ſeaſonable to convince them that there may be ſuch a thing as a miracle to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction?</p>
                  <p>Therefore, for any thing which yet appears to the contrary, it is agreeable to reaſon that Chriſt ſhould quickly and perſonally appear and reign with the faints on the earth.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Doctor ſays, that "this phraſe, 'Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt reſurrection,' implies that he <hi>only</hi> is bleſſed who hath part in the firſt reſurrection." But this cannot be granted. It is certainly true that he was bleſſed who had part in that reſurrection which took place at the beginning of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; but it is as true that others who had no part in it, were bleſſed and holy too. So, though they are bleſſed and holy who have part in the firſt ſurrection, others may be bleſſed and holy as well as they.</note>

                  <p>The happy New Jeruſalem, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, will be a ſociety entirely diſtinct fom the church militant, or 'the nations of them who are ſaved,' who will not then walk in New Jeruſalem, but only 'in the light of it.'<note n="†" place="bottom">The citizens of New Jeruſalem or church triumphant in that time may be capable of appearing to the church militant or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearing at pleaſure, as Chriſt was after his reſurrection, and may he again after his ſecond coming. The plan of this ſubject does not require us to view the New Jeruſalem ſtate as a Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etan paradiſe; though we cannot prove that perſed ſaints will nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſtaſte of a broiled fiſh or of an honey-comb. Luke xxiv. 42, 43.</note> In New jeruſalem 'there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor crying, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall there be any more pain.' But the nations of them who are ſaved will be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and be in need of healing.</p>
                  <p>But how is this conſiſtent, it may be aſked, with Rev. xxii. 15? 'Without are dogs, and ſorcerers, and whoremongers, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lie.'</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="108" facs="unknown:032007_0132_0FF09F520E908FB8"/>
But New Jeruſalem, it may be anſwered, is now in exiſtence, and dogs, and ſorcerers, are without it now, as much as they will be in that future time; yet the church militant are now without it too: And ſuch will be their caſe in that day. This paſſage declares not that <hi>only</hi> the wicked are without that city; but the plain meaning of it is, that no finally impenitent ſinner ſhall have a part in the bleſſedneſs of that city, as no ſuch one now ſhall ever go to heaven.</p>
                  <p>In oppoſing the doctrine of Chriſt's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal reign, Mr. Poole's continuators have an objection like this: 'If Chriſt ſhould live on earth through the Millennium, the ſaints who ſhall die in that time will not go to Chriſt.' But is not this a great miſtake? They certainly will go to Chriſt when they die; even if he ſhould reign on the earth. Already Chriſt has lived upon earth more than thirty years. And in that time the ſaints who died went to Chriſt: for the Son of Man was then in heaven; and there too he will be through the thouſand years. 'This day ſhalt thou be with me in paradiſe:' Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious promiſe! But Chriſt's bodily preſence was not in paradiſe that day. And we have not the leaſt evidence that departed ſaints now enjoy Chriſt's bodily preſence any more than if this bodily preſence was now on the earth: That ſublime felicity is doubtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>But it may be aſked, How will the doctrine of Chriſt's perſonal reign agree with his ſitting
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:032007_0133_0FF09F4223179CB0"/>on the right hand of God, and interceding for his people till his enemies be made his foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool? But the anſwer is, When Chriſt ſhall appear the ſecond time, he will deſtroy Gog and Magog, as already has been ſhewn. He will deſtroy them, who deſtroy the earth. And the ſpared nations will cheerfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto him. In ſome part of that day, it ſeems, all will be ſaints, perfect or imperfect. Then 'to the name of Jeſus every knee ſhall bow, and every tongue ſhall ſwear, of things in heaven and things in earth and things <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth;</hi>' that is, there will be cordial and univerſal ſubmiſſion to Chriſt <hi>all round the globe.</hi> Then doubtleſs, yea and before, his enemies will be made his footſtool.</p>
                  <p>But if 'ſitting on the right hand of God' means the ſame as 'ſitting on the right hand of power,' which probably no one will deny, then he will ſtill ſit on the right hand of God when he ſhall appear in this world: For he tells the Jews expreſsly, Matt. xxvi. 64, 'Hereafter ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.' And if he can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at God's right hand one hour in this world, then doubtleſs he can appear in this exalted ſtation a thouſand years in the ſame world.</p>
                  <p>And as to his interceſſion, will not that work be finiſhed at his ſecond coming, even if another diſpenſation ſhould follow? Did Chriſt carry on the work of interceſſion in
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:032007_0134_0FF09F4D44739278"/>the time of the prophetical diſpenſation? No. Is not our diſpenſation peculiar for the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Chriſt's prieſtly character? Be ſure it is: 'The way into the holieſt of all' is now made manifeſt, and Chriſt now intercedes for his elect, and why not for all his elect of each diſpenſation, of the future as well as the paſt? But ſuppoſe this work of interceſſion ſhould continue through the Millennium, why may it not continue upon earth? Chriſt has once interceded for his people already on the earth. John xvii. Why then may he not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede for them on earth hereafter?</p>
                  <p>But on the whole, the greateſt of all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to this doctrine among the faints ſeems to be that of the heart. The ſaints, in the exerciſe of grace, do not love to live in this world again. They had rather be in heaven; and no wonder; earth is a tireſome place, full of ſin and ſorrow. But a new earth with Chriſt, and a heaven upon it, will not be tireſome, but ineffably delightful. Heaven is not conſtituted by locality, but by perfect holineſs and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>There objections now conſidered, a few ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments directly proving this doctrine ſhall cloſe this part of the Section.</p>
                  <p>The prophet Zechariah declares, (chap. xiv. 5, 9) that, 'when the Lord his God ſhall come with all the ſaints, the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth: In that day there ſhall be one Lord and his name one.' Hitherto this world has had many ſupreme
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032007_0135_0FF09F5814DCBA90"/>rulers or lords; but in that day there ſhall be only one ſupreme ruler: Abraham's ſeed ſhall poſſeſs the whole. 'There ſhall be one Lord and his name one.' Then will be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled that of the prophet Iſaiah; 'He ſhall judge among the nations and rebuke many people.' The terms <hi>judge</hi> and <hi>rebuke</hi> mean ſomething more than merely the effuſions of the Spirit on mankind, and ſomething too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides eccleſiaſtical government, as appears from what follows: 'They ſhall beat their ſwords into ploughſhares and their ſpears in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pruning-hooks; nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more.' The deſign of eccleſiaſtical government is the ſupport of the Chriſtian character: The deſign of civil government is the preſervation of life, peace and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is the latter which is here mentioned as the happy effect of Chriſt's judging among the nations and rebuking many people. And, as if it was a thing difficult for men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we have the ſame almoſt verbatim, in Mic. iv. 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt judging 'the living and the dead at his appearing and <hi>kingdom,</hi>' (2 Tim. iv. 1) implies that he will erect a kingdom on earth when he ſhall appear. He ſaid to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, when he had predicted the ſigns of his coming, 'When all theſe thing begin to come to paſs, know ye that <hi>the kingdom of God</hi> is nigh at hand!' To ſhow how the kingdom of God ſhould appear, 'A certain nobleman,'

And it has been ſhewn how we are to underſtand that in Iſa. xxxv. 10, Dan. chap. vii. and Rev. xx. which ſo plainly ſpeak of the ſaints reviving and appearing with the clouds, their reigning and Chriſt's reigning before them a thouſand years, in which 'the kingdom and dominion and greatneſs of the kingdom (not above, not in the third heaven, but) <hi>under</hi> the whole heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High.'</p>

Another argument is the third petition of the Lord's prayer; 'Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.' If the world awe to have ſuch a Millennium as is commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, God's will can never be done on earth <hi>as it is heaven.</hi> Would Chriſt ſet his people to make a prayer which he knew never would be anſwered in any age of the world? But if heaven ſhould come down to the earth and reign upon earth, we eaſily ſee how God's will may be done upon earth as it is in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, that the crown of Chriſt will be as conſpicuous in this world as the croſs once was, will put down all rule and all authority and power: And then will be manifeſt, as never before, this glorious truth, 'The earth is the Lord's and the fulneſs thereof, the world, and they who dwell therein.'</p>
                  <p>INFERENCES.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence we may expect that the church militant in the Millennium will have much more knowledge of he heavenly life than the preſent diſpenſation affords. We are now poſſeſſed of much more light reſpecting our future ſtate than was ever enjoyed under the firſt diſpenſation. Many prophets and wiſe men deſired to ſee the things which we ſee, but could not ſee them. They enjoyed ſome degree of light reſpecting the future life of man, yet it was a light ſhining in a dark place! They beheld the promiſes afar off; but <hi>now</hi> 'life and immortality are brought (more clearly) to light by the goſpel.' And ſo the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032007_0138_0FF09F3108340190"/>next diſpenſation will afford much more knowledge of life and immortality than the preſent. The church triumphant on earth wil be the houſe of David, the royal reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing family. They will be as God, perfectly holy as God is, and free from error: and before the feeble church militant they ſhall be as the angel of the Lord to inſtruct and govern them, as already has been obſerved. Therefore doubtleſs the church militant will then have ſuch clear apprehenſions of the ſtate of a glorified body, and perhaps of the ſeparate ſtate, as the preſent diſpenſation nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er affords. They who ſhall walk in the light of New Jeruſalem will undoubtedly know better what that city is than we can know at preſent.</p>

Obſerve the glorious contraſt between the beſt government contrived by human wiſdom, and that which King Jeſus ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive by his infinite wiſdom. Before his firſt perſonal coming to teach the way of ſalvation, great opportunity was afforded to human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the ancient philoſophers to exert her utmoſt in teaching mankind the way to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: and hereby the inſufficiency of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſdom and the excellency of divine wiſdom were preſented to view in a much ſtronger light than if no ſuch opportunity had previouſly exiſted: to ſee firſt what man could do to illuminate and reform the world. So now, in theſe laſt days, great opportunity is afforded to human wiſdom to do her beſt in the art of government, and to form the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:032007_0139_0FF09F76FAFB0B78"/>moſt excellent conſtitutions, which perhaps ever exiſted, ſuch as theſe in America,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Adams's Defence of the American Conſtitutions is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th, of a place in every library, and to be read with attention and cando<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And when theſe new governments ſhall be corrupted, perhaps more than any former ones, and human inſufficiency with reſpect to this affair, ſhall be plainly exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then Chriſt will take to himſelf his great power and reign. Then ſhall the loftineſs of man be humbled, and the haughtineſs of man be bowed down, and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day. Happy nations! who are to ſee the glorious difference between what is now called government (and for the preſent to be highly reſpected as ſuch) and that which ſhall be practiſed by infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and benevolence! What love and joy will warm every breaſt, ſparkle in every eye, and flow through every land!</p>

               <head>MISCELLANEOUS CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>THE ſubject of this Differtation, in what light ſoever the reader may view it, is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably of great importance. The time here treated of is at hand; and the preſent revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and concuſſion of nations loudly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licit our attention thereto. The man of ſin has become old; grey hairs are here and there upon him. He cannot live long, and therefore it cannot be matter of indifference how we are to underſtand thoſe prophecies which predict the manner and circumſtances of his death. It cannot be matter of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or mere ſpeculation whether the Judge ſtands far off or before the door.</p>
               <p>But important as the ſcheme is, if true, it muſt not be generally received in theſe laſt days: For if ſuch a belief ſhould become general, there would be a general expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's coming. But it has been ſhewn, that Chriſt will come in a day when men in general look not for him, and in an hour that they are not aware of. The opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion which has been ſo common ever ſince the fourth century (an age remarkable for the prevalence of error) will doubtleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo to the end, that the ſcripture may be fulfilled.</p>
               <p>If ſome things now advanced be true, a time of trouble for the church is haſtening;
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:032007_0141_0FF09F43ADC20CE0"/>a bitter cup which ſhe muſt drink at the hand of illuminated ſinners. The liberality of ſentiment every where prevailing at this day, is no evidence of the contrary at all. Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions from one extreme to another among mankind, are no ſtrange events.</p>
               <p>The next generation, it is highly probable, will be more corrupt than this, both in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and practice. And the hearts of all muſt be revealed ſooner or later; every ſort of men muſt be known. We know what method was taken to manifeſt the hearts of the liberal Jews; and Divine Wiſdom will certainly find ſome method hereafter, clearly to manifeſt that the <hi>greateſt</hi> catholiciſm of an unregenerate man, is entirely conſiſtent with inveterate enmity againſt the true religion. But in all this futur e trouble, the church will be ſupported and comforted. They who know their God will be ſtrong, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt them. The converſion of the Jews will afford matter of abundant joy to the precious, believing remnant of the Gentiles. It will ſerve to ſtrengthen their faith, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to their view a ſweet proſpect of their ſpeedy and perfect deliverance from all the oppoſition of earth and hell. Chriſt will take as much care of his people in that day as he does now or ever did in any former age of the world.</p>
               <p>To conclude. Many queſtions will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs riſe in the reader's mind, which this Diſſertation has not reſolved. Some object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:032007_0142_0FF09F691617BF18"/>may appear not ſufficiently anſwered, and ſome texts not clearly explained: But after all it might not hence follow, that the whole ſcheme ſhould be haſtily rejected. It ſhould be carefully conſidered, whether the reſolution of thoſe queſtions be neceſſary to the ſupport of the ſcheme; and whether the unanſwered objections might not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Errors here and there may-appear, while the ſyſtem may be true, and entirely conſiſtent with reaſon and ſcripture.<note n="*" place="bottom">The doctrine of a partial conflagration, will doubtleſs be the occaſion of objections. The conflagration will be ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected: There will be no time for Lot to flee to Zoar. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore through all that, which the ſcripture terms the whole world, <hi>all</hi> the faints muſt be changed, that they may eſcape. But we ſhould carefully conſider, that ſome prophecies which have the word <hi>all,</hi> and which have an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

When the Chriſtian world ſhall be deſtroyed, <hi>many more</hi> will be as ſtubble; and at the laſt burning, <hi>all</hi> the wicked without exception will be as ſtubble; and then too <hi>all</hi> the ſaints without exception will be raiſed and changed. At the firſt of theſe three periods, Chriſt was perſonally preſent on the earth; ſo he will be at the ſecond, and at the third.
