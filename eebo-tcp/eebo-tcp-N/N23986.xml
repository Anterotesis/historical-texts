            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>THE VISION OF MIRZA.</head>
               <p>ON the fifth day of the moon, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of my forefathers, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep holy, after having waſhed myſelf, and offered up my morning devotions, I aſcended the high hills of Bagdat, in order to paſs the reſt of the the day in meditation and prayer. As I was here airing myſelf on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound comtemplation on the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of human life; and paſſing from one thought to another, "Surely," ſaid I, "man is but a ſhadow, and life a dream." Whilſt I was thus muſing, I caſt my eyes towards the ſummit of a rock that was not far from me, where I diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one in the habit of a ſhepherd, with a little muſical inſtrument in his hand. As I looked
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031735_0003_0FEE2881E0A1DDD8"/>
upon him he applied it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The ſound of it was exceeding ſweet, and wrought into a variety of tunes that were inexpreſſibly melodious, and altogether dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any thing I had ever heard, they put me in mind of thoſe heavenly airs that are play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the departed ſouls of good men upon their firſt arrival in Paradiſe; to wear out the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the laſt agonies, and qualify them for the pleaſures of that happy place. My heart melted away in ſecret raptures.</p>
               <p>I had been often told that the rock before me was the haunt of a genius; and that ſeveral had been entertained with the muſic, who had paſſed by it, but never heard that the muſician had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made himſelf viſible. When he had raiſed my thoughts by thoſe tranſporting airs which he played, to taſte the pleaſures of his converſation, as I looked upon him like one aſtoniſhed, he bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to me, and by the waving of his hand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected me to approach the place where he ſat. I drew near with that reverence which is due to a ſuperior nature; and as my heart was entirely ſubdued by the captivating ſtrains I had heard, I fell down at his feet and wept. The genius ſmiled upon me with a look of compaſſion and affability, that familiarized him to my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at once diſpelled all the fears and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions with which I approached him. He
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031735_0004_0FEE288366F08D38"/>
lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand, "Mirza," ſaid he, "I have heard thee in thy ſoliloquies; follow me."</p>
               <p>He then led me to the higheſt pinnacle of the rock, and placing me on the top of it, "Caſt thine eyes eaſtward," ſaid he, "and tell me what thou ſeeſt." "I ſee," ſaid I, "a huge valley, and a prodigious tide of water rolling through it." "The valley that thou ſeeſt," ſaid he. "is the vale of miſery, and the tide of water that thou ſeeſt, is part of the great tide of eternity." "What is the reaſon," ſaid I, "that the tide I ſee riſes out of a thick miſt at the one end, and again loſes itſelf in a thick miſt at the other?" "What thou ſeeſt," ſaid he, "is that portion of eternity which is called time, meaſured out by the ſun, and reaching from the beginning of the world to its conſummation. Examine now," ſaid he, "this ſea that is bounded with darkneſs at both ends, and tell me what thou diſcovereſt in it." "I ſee a bridge," ſaid I, "ſtanding in the midſt of the tide." "The bridge thou ſeeſt," ſaid he, "is human life; conſider it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively." Upon a more leiſure ſurvey of it, I found that it conſiſted of three ſcore and ten en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire arches, with ſeveral broken arches, which, added to thoſe that were entire, made up the number about an hundred. As I was counting the arches, the genius told me that this bridge
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031735_0005_0FEE2884EE5E9718"/>
conſiſted at firſt of a thouſand arches; but that a great flood ſwept away the reſt, and left the bridge in the ruinous condition I now beheld it: "But tell me further," ſaid he, "what thou diſcovereſt on it." "I ſee multitudes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple paſſing over it," ſaid I, "and a black cloud hanging on each end of it." As I looked more attentively, I ſaw ſeveral of the paſſengers drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping through the bridge, into the great tide that flowed underneath it; and upon further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, perceived there were innumerable trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doors that lay concealed in the bridge, which the paſſengers no ſooner trod upon, but they fell through them into the tide, and immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared. Theſe hidden pit-falls were ſet very thick at the entrance of the bridge, ſo that throngs of people no ſooner broke through the cloud, but many of them fell into them. They grew thinner towards the middle, but multiplied and lay cloſer together towards the end of the arches that were entire.</p>
               <p>There were indeed ſome perſons, but their number was very ſmall, that continued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches, but fell through one after another, being quite tired and ſpent with ſo long a walk.</p>
               <p>I paſſed ſome time in the contemplation of this wonderful ſtructure, and the great variety of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which it preſented. My heart was filled
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031735_0006_0FEE288B6E0F2B10"/>
with a deep melancholy to ſee ſeveral dropping unexpectedly in the midſt of mirth and jollity, and catching at every thing that ſtood by them to ſave themſelves. Some were looking up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the heavens in a thoughtful poſture, and in the midſt of a ſpeculation ſtumbled and fell out of ſight. Multitudes were very buſy in the purſuit of bubbles that glittered in their eyes and danced before them; but often when they thought themſelves within the reach of them, their footing failed, and down they ſunk. In this confuſion of objects, I obſerved ſome with ſcimitars in their hands, and others with urinals, who ran to and fro from the bridge, thruſting ſeveral perſons on trap-doors which did not ſeem to lie in their way, and which they might have eſcaped had they not been thus forced upon them.</p>
               <p>The genius ſeeing me indulge myſelf in this melancholy proſpect, told me I had dwelt long enough upon it: "Take thine eyes off the bridge," ſaid he, "and tell me if thou ſeeſt any thing thou doſt not comprehend." Upon look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, "What mean," ſaid I, "thoſe great ſight of birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge, and ſettling upon it from time to time? I ſee vultures, harpies, ravens, cormorants, and among many other feathered creatures ſeveral lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle winged boys, that perch in great numbers
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031735_0007_0FEE2891D9D8C688"/>
upon the middle arches." "Theſe," ſaid the genius, "are envy, avarice, ſuperſtition, deſpair, love, with the like cares and paſſions that infeſt human life."</p>
               <p>I here fetched a deep ſigh; "Alas," ſaid I, "man was ſurely made in vain! how is he given away to miſery and mortality! tortured in life, and ſwallowed up in death!" The genius being moved with compaſſion towards me, bid me quit ſo uncomfortable a proſpect. "Look no more," ſaid he, "on man in the firſt ſtage of his exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, in his ſetting out for eternity; but caſt thine eye on that thick miſt into which the tide bears the ſeveral generations of mortals that fall into it." I directed my ſight as I was ordered, and (whether or no the good genius ſtrengthened it with any ſupernatural force, or diſſipated part of the miſt that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I ſaw the valley opening at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, and ſpreading forth into an immenſe ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through the midſt of it, and dividing it into two equal parts. The clouds ſtill reſted on one half of it, inſomuch that I could diſcover nothing in it; but the other appeared to me a vaſt ocean planted with innumerable iſlands, that were cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with fruits and flowers, and interwoven with a thouſand little ſhining ſeas that run among them. I could ſee perſons dreſſed in glorious habits
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031735_0008_0FEE28936144D498"/>
with garlands upon their heads, paſſing among the trees, laying down by the ſides of fountains, or reſting on beds of flowers; and could hear a confuſed harmony of ſinging birds, falling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, human voices, and muſical inſtruments. Gladneſs grew in me upon the diſcovery of ſo delightful a ſcene. I wiſhed for the wings of an eagle, that I might fly away to thoſe happy ſeats; but the genius told me there was no paſſage to them, except through the gates of death that I ſaw opening every moment upon the bridge. "The iſlands," ſays he, "that lie ſo freſh and green before thee, and with which the whole face of the ocean appears ſpotted as far as thou canſt ſee, are more in number than the ſand on the ſea ſhore; there are myriads of iſlands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thoſe which thou here diſcovereſt, reaching further than thine eyes, or even thine imagination can extend itſelf. Theſe are the manſions of good men after death, who, according to the degree and kinds of virtue in which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled, are diſtributed among theſe ſeveral iſlands, which abound with pleaſures of different kinds and degrees, ſuitable to the reliſhes and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe who are ſettled in them; every iſland is a paradiſe accommodated to its reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inhabitants. Are not theſe, O Mirza, habitations worth contending for? Does life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear miſerable, that gives thee opportunities of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031735_0009_0FEE2894E8FDA700"/>
earning ſuch a reward? is death to be feared, that will convey thee to ſo happy an exiſtence? think not man was made in vain, who has ſuch an eternity reſerved for him." I gazed with inexpreſſible pleaſure on theſe happy iſlands. At length, ſaid I, "ſhew me now I beſeech thee, the ſecrets that lie hid under thoſe dark clouds, which cover the ocean on the other ſide of the rock of adamant. The genius making me no anſwer, I turned about to addreſs myſelf to him a ſecond time, but I found that he had left me; I then turned again to the viſion which I had been ſo long contemplating; but inſtead of the rolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy iſlands, I ſaw nothing but the long hollow valley of Bagdat, with oxen, ſheep and camels upon the ſides of it.</p>

               <head>BENEVOLENCE URGED FROM THE MYSERY OF SOL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ITUDE. AN EASTERN STORY.</head>
               <p>CARASAN, the merchant of Bagdat, was eminent throughout all the Eaſt for his avarice and his wealth: His origin was obſcure, as that of the ſpark which by the colliſion of ſteel and adamant is ſtruck out of darkneſs; and the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031735_0010_0FEE289B0703DE30"/>
patient labour of preſerving diligence alone had made him rich. It was remembered, that when he was indigent he was thought to be generous; and he was ſtill acknowledged to be inexorably juſt. But whether, in his dealings with men, he diſcovered a perfidy which tempted him to put his truſt in gold, or whether in proportion as he accumulated wealth, he diſcovered his own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to increaſe; Carazan prized it more as he uſed it leſs: he gradually loſt the inclination to do good, as he acquired the power; and as the hand of time ſcattered ſnow upon his head, the freezing influence extended to his boſom.</p>
               <p>But though the door of Carazan was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver opened by hoſpitality, nor his hand by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, yet fear led him conſtantly to the moſque at the ſtated hours of prayer; he performed all the rites of devotion with the moſt ſcrupulous punctuality, and had thrice paid his vows at the temple of the prophet. That devotion which ariſes from the love of God, and neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the love of man, as it connects gratitude with beneficence, and exalts that which was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to divine, confers new dignity upon goodneſs, and is the object not only of affection but rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. On the contrary, the devotion of the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, whether it be thought to avert the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which every one wiſhes to be inflicted, or to inſure it by the complication of hypocriſy with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031735_0011_0FEE28A0975B2810"/>
guilt, never fails to excite indignation and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Carazan, therefore, when he had locked his door, turning round with a look of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective ſuſpicion, proceeded to the moſque, and was followed by every eye with ſilent malignity; the poor ſuſpended their ſupplication when he paſſed by; and though he was known by every man, yet no man ſaluted him.</p>
               <p>Such had long been the life of Carazan, and ſuch was the character which he had acquired, when notice was given by proclamation, that he was removed to a magnificent building in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the city, that his table ſhould be ſpread for the public, and that the ſtranger ſhould be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to his bed. The multitude ſoon ruſhed like a torrent to his door, where they beheld him diſtributing bread to the hungry, and apparel to the naked, and his eye ſoftened with compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and his cheek glowing with delight. Every one gazed with aſtoniſhment at the prodigy; and the murmur of innumerable voices increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the ſound of approaching thunder. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razan beckoned with his hand; attention ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the tumult in a moment, and he thus gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the curioſity which had procured him audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>To Him who touches the mountains and they ſmoke; the Almighty, and the moſt Merciful, be everlaſting honour! he has ordained ſleep to be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031735_0012_0FEE28A21F6E0D10"/>
the miniſter of inſtruction, and his viſions have reproved me in the night. As I was ſitting alone in my haram, with my lamp burning before me, computing the product of my merchandiſe and exulting in the increaſe of my wealth, I fell into a deep ſleep, and the hand of him who dwells in the third heaven was upon me. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the angel of death coming forward like a whirlwind, and he ſmote me before I could dep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recate the blow. At the ſame moment I felt myſelf lifted from the ground, and tranſported with aſtoniſhing rapidity through the regions of the air. The earth was contracted to an atom beneath; and the ſtars glowed round me with a luſtre that obſcured the ſun. The gate of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe was now in ſight; and I was intercepted by a ſudden brightneſs which no human eye could behold; the irrevocable ſentence was now to be pronounced; my days of probation was paſt; and from the evil of my life nothing could be taken away, nor could any thing be added to the good. When I reflected that my lot for eternity was caſt, which not all the powers of nature could reverſe, my confidence totally forſook me; and while I ſtood trembling and ſilent, covered with confuſion and chilled with horror, I was thus addreſſed by the radiance that flamed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</p>

                  <q>Carazan, thy worſhip has not been accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it was not prompted by the love of God; neither can thy righteouſneſs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, becauſe it was not produced by love of man; for thy own ſake only, haſt thou ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to every man his due; and thou haſt approached the Almighty only for thyſelf. Thou haſt not looked up with gratitude, nor round thee with kindneſs. Around thee, thou haſt, indeed, behold vice and folly; but if vice and folly could juſtify thy parſimony, would they not condemn the bounty of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? If not upon the fooliſh and vicious, where ſhall the ſun diffuſe its light, or the clouds diſtill their dew? where ſhall the lips of the ſpring breathe fragrance, or the hand of autumn diffuſe plenty? remember, Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan, that thou haſt ſhut compaſſion from thine heart, and graſped thy treaſures with a hand of iron: thou haſt lived for thyſelf; and therefore, henceforth for ever thou ſhalt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt alone. From the light of heaven, and from the ſociety of all beings, ſhalt thou be driven; ſolitude ſhall protract the lingering hours of eternity, and darkneſs aggravate the horrors of deſpair.</q> At the moment I was driven by ſome ſecret and irreſiſtable power through the glowing ſyſtem of creation, and paſſed innumerable worlds in a moment. As I approached the verge of nature, I perceived
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031735_0014_0FEE28AAAF87CD08"/>
the ſhadows of total and boundleſs vacuity deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en before me; a dreadful region of eternal ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſolitude and darkneſs! unutterable horror ſeized me at the proſpect, and this exclamation burſt from me with all the vehemence of deſire: <q>O! that I had been doomed for ever to the common receptacle of impenitence and guilt! there ſociety would have alleviated the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of deſpair, and the rage of fire could not have excluded the comfort of light. Or if I had been condemned to reſide on a comet, that would return but once in a thouſand years to the regions of light and life; the hope of theſe periods, however diſtant, would chear me in the dreary interval of cold and darkneſs, and the viciſſitude would divide eternity into time.</q> While this thought paſſed over my mind, I loſt ſight of the remoteſt ſtar, and the laſt glimmering of light was quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in utter darkneſs. The agonies of deſpair every moment increaſed, as every moment aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented my diſtance from the laſt habitable world. I reflected with intolerable anguiſh, that when ten thouſand thouſand years had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me beyond the reach of all but that power who fills infinitude, I ſhould ſtill look forward into an immenſe abyſs of darkneſs, through which I ſhould ſtill drive without ſuccour and without ſociety, farther and farther ſtill, for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031735_0015_0FEE28B1CE77D3B0"/>
ever and ever. I then ſtretched out my hands towards the regions of exiſtence, with an emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that awakened me. Thus have I been taught to eſtimate ſociety, like every other bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, by its loſs. My heart is warmed to liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and I am zealous to communicate the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which I feel, to thoſe from whom it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; for the ſociety of one wretch, whom in the pride of proſperity I would have ſpurned from my door, would, in the dreadful ſolitude to which I was condemned, have been more highly prized, than the gold of Afric, or the gems of Golconda.</p>
               <p>At this reflection upon his dream, Carazan became ſuddenly ſilent, and looked upward in an extacy of gratitude and devotion. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude were ſtruck at once with the precept and example; and the Caliph, to whom the event was related, that he might be liberal beyond the power of gold, commanded it to be recorded for the benefit of poſterity.</p>

               <head>COVETOUSNESS ITS OWN PUNISHMENT. A TALE.</head>
               <p>IN the city of Mexico, as we are told, by that famous and much to be depended on hiſtorian Father Giardino, there lived a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gentleman, called Don Cavanilla Quignata Lorenzano, who had once followed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of a ſcrivener, but had now betaken himſelf to that honorable and uſeful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the aſſiſting of his fellow-creatures with a portion of his own wealth at cent. per cent. intereſt, vulgarly denominated uſury. This worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon in the fiftieth and fourth year of his age, entered into a contract of matrimony with the virtuous Donna Eſtifania Montenella, in the eight and thirtieth year of hers. To this tranſaction he was the rather induced, not more on account of the beauty of her perſon and the qualities of her mind, than becauſe ſhe was very rich, and as careful of her money as he was of his. Already had Lorenzano paſſed ten good years with his dame in the honorable ſtate of holy matrimony, without how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever enjoying the comforts of a family of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for the want of which bleſſing he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted himſelf in public, by expreſſing his thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to Providence for being thus freed of a
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031735_0017_0FED38126C333750"/>
multitude of cares, and in private by the thoughts of the great expence he was thus ſaved; for as the prudent Lorenzano hardly allowed himſelf the neceſſaries of life, wiſely conſidering that his riches, great as they were, might make to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wings and fly away, you may judge whether he would have reliſhed the expence attending the feeding, the cloathing, and educating a numerous family. He was wiſe from obſervation; for his father diſinherited his elder brother, becauſe he was a thoughtleſs, gay, extravagant youth, and left his fortune to Lorenzano, whoſe diſpoſitions were ſimilar to his own. Of this he had many proofs; but one in particular determined him; for, when a favourite dog which was warmly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to Lorenzano, having grown up with him from his infancy, had became too old to go abroad to find its food in the dung-hills or on the ſtreets, he had ſhut it out of the houſe, and allowed it to die for want.</p>
               <p>When Lorenzano had not occaſion to go to market for the purpoſe of victuals, an expedition which he took perhaps twice a month, he ſeldom left the houſe. When he appeared in the ſtreet, the children uſed to run after him, and a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous little rogue would often pick an onion out of his pocket through the holes of his old cloak as he was travelling homeward loaden with vegetables.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:031735_0018_0FEE28BDAF2FE908"/>
His coat was ſo ancient, and had been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten patched, that few people in Mexico remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered its original colour, the thrifty Donna Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifania had exerted her ſkill on it with ſuch ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that it not only fortified her good man from the inclemency of the weather, but might have defended him from the effect of a bullet had it been aimed at him. Of ſimilar or ſuperior ſtrength were a pair of jack boots which he conſtantly wore; theſe by frequent accretions of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory leather to the legs, and of tinplate nailed to the ſouls, became ſo ſtrong, that they might well have ſerved as buckets to the moſt frequented well in Mexico. But that he might not be quite born down with the weight of his apparel, he uniformly carried in his right hand a thick knob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed ſtick, which not only ſerved him for ſupport, but as a defence againſt the noiſy curs of the city which always barked at him as he went along. At his left ſide he likewiſe wore a ſword, which reſembled as one egg does another, that of the renowned Sir Hudibras, as friend Butler deſcribes it. Notwithſtanding this miſerable armour and ſorry apparel, he never forgot to diſplay the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of an order of knighthood conferred on him by a late Viceroy of his Catholic Majeſty, for certain ſervices rendered to the revenues of the ſtate of Mexico, or rather to the emoluments of the ſaid Viceroy. Certainly the inſignia of that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031735_0019_0FEE28BF35957010"/>
celebrated order had never hung on the breaſt of a more miſerable ſubject; but it convinced the people of Mexico, that a dung hill cannot receive luſtre even from a diamond.</p>

                  </gap> fine morning in the Spring, that Lovenzano ſet out for the fields in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the city to gather ſimples for a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral draught, more ſalutary than tea, to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort; and to regale himſelf with a freſh ſalad, made luxurious by the thought that he ſhould pay nothing for it. As he paſſed ſome magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent country ſeats without the town, he obſerved below a tree an Indian ſervant, whom ſleep had overtaken, and beſide whom lay a pair of delicate new boots, which attracted the eager gaze, and excited the covetous deſires of our noble knight. He ſpoke and coughed aloud, and when he ſaw that the ſleeper did not awake, he conſidered this as a charming opportunity to poſſeſs himſelf of a pair of new boots at no expence. He quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſincumbered himſelf of his own old ſervants, which he laid down beſide the Indian, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made free with the new ones, he ſcampered off with as much celerity as if he had been run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for a wager.</p>
               <p>With what joy, when he got home, did he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in ſecret to his ſpouſe his ſucceſsful trick, and with what rapture did he ſurvey his well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed feet!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:031735_0020_0FEE28C0C2598C18"/>
"God knows, ſaid he to himſelf, it was a lucky hour when I firſt thought of going out to gather ſimples."</p>
               <p>Next day he went to church, aſſiſted with much devotion at a maſs, and gave a few coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit maravedis in charity. But ſcarcely had he turned his back on the church, when he felt himſelf ſuddenly ſeized by the ſhoulder, and looking about, ſaw an Indian ſervant in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Viceroy, crying aloud, "this is the thief, this is the thief"</p>
               <p>"What do you mean, raſcal?" ſaid Lorenza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, ſomewhat confidently.</p>
               <p>"Sennor Caballero, replied the Indian, you have ſtolen theſe boots, which belong to the Viceroy. They are a preſent from the king of Quizzimoro, who to paſs the tedious hours, and to drive away melancholy, diverts himſelf with the making of boots. I will prove it, for the king ſtamps under the inſtep of all his boots his own mark, which is a golden ſun,"</p>
               <p>At this inſtant by chance there was paſſing an Alguazil, and Lorenzano was immediately car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the judge; the boots were diſcovered to be his Majeſty of Quizzimoro's own make, and to be the identical boots that were ſent by him to the Viceroy The byſtanders, well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the covetous diſpoſition of Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zano,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031735_0021_0FEE28C4862F11A0"/>
rejoiced to hear him condemned to pay a fine of a thouſand doubloons, with coſts of ſuit. The Alguazil called a hackney coach, made Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzano enter it, mounted after him, and driving to his houſe received from the trembling hands of the petrified knight the whole money, gave him a diſcharge for it, and leaving his own old jack-boots, laughed in his face and bid him good morrow.</p>
               <p>Ah! merciful God! cried Donna Eſtifania, tearing, like another Meduſa, a handful of hair out of her head, what an infamous rogue have I for a huſband! a thouſand doubloons! I am ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined and undone!</p>
               <p>"God knows, ſaid Lorenzano, with loud la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, it was an unlucky hour when I firſt thought of going out to gather ſimples."</p>
               <p>With a look, furious as Othello's, he caſt his eyes on the jack-boots which the Alguazil had left in the middle of the room, and ſpringing up, he threw them both out of the window into the lake.</p>
               <p>It happened that about this time two fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, his neighbours, who had ſpread their net in the morning, were now preparing to draw it, and finding an unuſual weight in it, "Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, ſaid one of them, God has been good to us this morning, the net is ſo heavy that it is impoſſible it can be with fiſh; who knows but we
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031735_0022_0FEE28CB240F9528"/>
have found a treaſure? ſome box of money or jewels, or ſomething as valuable, is certainly in the net.—Accordingly they ſet to with all their might to haul the net on ſhore; but what was their grief when, inſtead of the treaſure they had flattered themſelves with finding, they ſaw only the monſtrous jack-boots which had torn more than an hundred holes in their only net. Full of indignation at their misfortune, and chag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rined at their diſappointed hopes, they took up the boots and threw them in at the window of the diſconſolate knight, as he ſat ruminating on his late diſaſter. Unluckily one of them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to ſtrike upon a cabinet containing a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ſervice of porcelaine, given to Lorenzano, in pawn for a large ſum of money, which it brought to the ground with a hideous craſh, and the whole contents were ſhivered to atoms.</p>
               <p>"O theſe curſed jack-boots, cried Donna Eſtifania; would they and that old villain, who will bring me to a bit of bread, were both at the devil! God pity me, and forgive all my ſins."</p>
               <p>"Alas! ſobbed Lorenzano, miſerable man that I am! how unlucky has been the hour that firſt led me out to gather ſimples."</p>
               <p>"Out of the houſe this inſtant, cried Eſtifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, with your vile boots, and let me never ſee an atom of them more"</p>
               <p>Lorenzano took up the unfortunate boots, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031735_0023_0FEE28CF118FB658"/>
at night went into his garden, where, by the light of a farthing candle which glimmered through an old broken lantern, he dug a hole, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his ill-fated boots to the cold ground.</p>
               <p>A neighbour of his, by trade a joiner, had once been employed in mending ſome old furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for our honorable knight, but had been paid ſo ſcurvily for his labour, that he ſtill bore the old man a grudge—This man happened to ſee Sennor Lorenzano ſo late at work in his garden, ſuſpected that ſomething unlawful was going on, and therefore he called his neighbours about him.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Lorenzano had gone to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpot, where, without the knowledge of his lady wife, he had concealed a little caſket with ſome jewels, to ſee if they were ſtill ſafe, and he found them ſo. He ſat himſelf down beſide the caſket, which he opened, and with ſuch ſecret joy contemplated his hidden treaſure, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgot his late misfortunes.</p>
               <p>The following day the joiner waited on a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and related to him what he and his neighbours had ſeen. It was immediately ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that Lorenzano, had found a treaſure; and as by the law of the country every valuable thing found under the earth belongs to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Majeſty, a deputation was forthwith diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched, headed by the joiner and a notary, to the garden of Lorenzano, who ſoon dug up the caſket with the jewels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:031735_0024_0FEE28D3102BD0F8"/>
"You know, I preſume, Sennor, ſaid the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, that all treaſures in the bowels of the earth belong of right to our liege lord his Catholic Majeſty; and that when they are found they muſt be delivered up to the council of ſtate."</p>
               <p>"I know it well, ſaid Lorenzano, trembling; but this caſket is my own private property."</p>
               <p>"Your own private property!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, upon my honeſt word it is."</p>
               <p>Why would you bury it, then, ſaid the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if it were your own private property? no, no, that is but a pretence. Theſe jewels muſt have been depoſited in the earth by ſome of the inhabitants at the time of the ſiege of the town by Cortez, and our valient anceſtors; it could not be you who buried them."</p>
               <p>"By the bleſſed virgin, ſaid Lorenzano, they were wore by my own mother."</p>
               <p>Do not call the bleſſed virgin, ſaid the notary, to palliate your crime, or to witneſs your impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; ſhe is better employed than to vouch for your falſhoods. I hereby ſeize and confiſcate theſe jewels in the name of his Catholic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and of the council of ſtate."</p>
               <p>"Ah! wretch that I am!" exclaimed Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzano. "And to puniſh you, continued the notary, for having attempted to embezzle this treaſure, by concealing it, I hereby further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, that you immediately pay a fine of one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031735_0025_0FEE28D9701E0228"/>
doubloons, together with the expences of this deputation."</p>
               <p>It was in vain that Lorenzano proteſted and ſwore, and raved like one poſſeſſed; he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to pay the money; and the caſket with the jewels was carried off by the deputation in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per form.</p>
               <p>When Donna Eſtifania was made acquainted with theſe proceedings ſhe fell into fits, ſhe ſeized a knife with which ſhe was going to finiſh her own exiſtence; but reflecting better upon the buſineſs, her rage took another turn, and ſhe vented it on the unhappy Lorenzano with ſuch effect, that he retained the marks of it in his fleſh for many a day.</p>
               <p>The poor wretch went out full of anguiſh into his garden, dug up his jack-boots, and threw them when it was night into the canal that ran through his ſtreet. It is well known that canals run through all the ſtreets of Mexico, which are furniſhed with grates in particular places.</p>
               <p>In the morning, nobody in the neighbourhood could get out of their houſe; for the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous jack-boots had planted themſelves againſt the grate of that ſtreet, like a pair of dragons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an enchanted caſtle; and ſo prevented the water from paſſing, that the whole ſtreet was overflowed. The officers of the police immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went to viſit the grate, and finding the jack-boots
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031735_0026_0FEE28DAF73FC0C8"/>
of the unhappy Lorenzano choaking it up, they took them out and proceeded with them to his houſe. Sore from the bruiſes of yeſterday, Lorenzano could hardly move from his bed; but upon hearing an alarm without he crawled to the window, and ſeeing the inundation, his fears gave him a true foreboding of what was to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
               <p>The waters were no ſooner let off than a body of city officers approached his houſe, bearing the jack-boots like trophies on a long pole before them.</p>
               <p>"Ah! God pity me! cried Lorenzano, they are bringing back thoſe damn'd boots that I laſt night threw into the kennel."</p>
               <p>"Into the kennel did you throw them? ſaid Eſtifania, with a voice not much calculated to ſooth his ſorrows, or allay his apprehenſions; O thou ſtupid wretch! didſt thou not know how ſtrictly it is forbidden to throw any thing there. Certainly the boots have ſtopt up the grate and cauſed the overflow of the water. We are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done."</p>
               <p>It is as I feared, "ſighed Lorenzano" The officers entered the houſe, threw down the jack-boots, and led Lorenzano on before the judge.</p>
               <p>Here he was accuſed of contempt of the law, by throwing his jack-boots into the canal, and of preventing the whole inhabitants of the ſtreet
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031735_0027_0FEE28DC8228B048"/>
from going about their lawful occupations, by the inundation he had occaſioned. He was fined in a thouſand doubloons, and ordered to pay damages and expences.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had he paid the money than he ran to his kitchen, made a fire upon the hearth, and threw in his jack-boots. "If the water will not keep you, ſaid he, I will make fire finiſh you." The boots which had lain all night in the water, were ſo wet that they put out the fire when they were thrown into it. What, ſaid he, do you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy even the flames? What witches and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians cannot reſiſt, will you a pair of infernal jack-boots, think to eſcape? No, if you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamanders, or aſbeſtos itſelf, you ſhall burn, With theſe words, he brought all the dry wood he could find, and made ſuch a fire, that at laſt the flames reached the roof, and ſet fire to the houſe. Immediately the cry of fire reſounded through the city. Eſtifania fainted; and had not Lorenzano thrown a whole pitcher of water about her ears, ſhe would probably have given up the ghoſt.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the fire was got under without doing any conſiderable damage; but Lorenzano for his careleſſneſs, and the alarm he had given to the city, was fined in another thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand doubloons, and to pay all expenſes. He was obliged to ſubmit and pay the money, and a

ſigh and a tear dropt on every piece as he count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
               <p>"Since the unhappy day that I went to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimples—</p>
               <p>"Hold your tongue, cries Eſtifania, vile wretch."</p>
               <p>"For God's ſake, dear Fanna, replies the Knight, allow me to ſpeak, or elſe my heart will burſt with vexation. Since that unhappy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannical expedition, misfortunes have fallen thick upon me! thoſe infernal boots—4000 doubloons with coſts, and a box of jewels! The boots of my whole family, ſince the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Moors from Granada, never coſt half the ſum."</p>
               <p>"I am the moſt miſerable of all miſerable women, cried Eſtifania! Little joy have I had in my married ſtate; but I deſire you once for all to take theſe hateful boots from my ſight. Would to God I had never ſeen either you or them, for they will bring me to beggary."</p>
               <p>"I have thrown them, ſays Lorenzano, into the kennel, into the fire, and have buried them in the earth. I ſhall try if all the elements are in league againſt me. I ſhall hang them out in the free air, that they may rot like a thief on the gallows.</p>

He immediately went and ſecured them upon a nail on the wall of his houſe near the window of his own chamber; and when they had hung there ſeveral days, he congratulated himſelf on his invention, and he rejoiced that at laſt he got theſe curſed boots diſpoſed of, that had wrought him ſo much vexation and diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time, the boots were obſerved by the boys in the ſtreet, who began to divert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by throwing ſtones at them, and happy was he who was lucky enough to hit them. The boys were often indeed chaſed away by Loren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zano, who did not reliſh their ſport; but the boots were ſo excellent a mark, that they ſoon returned. One day as the Knight was ſitting ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating on his loſſes, an unlucky ſtone, that had been aimed at the boots, took a wrong di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and entering the window, ſtruck poor Lorenzano on the mouth, and drove out two of the few teeth he had remaining. Smarting with pain, and mad with reſentment, he haſtily armed himſelf with his knobbed ſtick, and ran into the ſtreet—but the boys more nimble than he, were ſoon out of his reach, and he was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into his houſe unrevenged. He concealed himſelf behind the door, however, to be in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to bolt out upon the firſt attack made on his boots. Some other boys, who did not know of the accident which had juſt happened, ſoon
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031735_0030_0FEE28EA0D45EB30"/>
began to take their accuſtomed diverſion, when ſuddenly Lorenzano quitting his hiding place, ſallied out to the ſtreet, and blind with rage, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the object of his reſentment, and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſtruck one of the Viceroy's pages, who was accidentally paſſing, ſuch a blow on the head, that the blood guſhed at once from his mouth and noſtrils.</p>
               <p>The boys run away, and Lorenzano, who ſaw his miſtake, ſlunk back to his houſe trembling.</p>
               <p>Eſtifania, who was looking out of the window when this unhappy qui pro que took place, grew inſtantly frantic, ſunk into a chair, and fell into a fit. In a little time, a knocking was heard at the door, and Lorenzano judging rightly that it was an officer of juſtice who demanded admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, had not courage to face him, but retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for protection to the chamber of his wife.—Reader, you may have heard of the unhappy Oreſtes, who, when flying from the vengeance of his frantic mother found his retreat cut off, and the furies themſelves obſtructing his eſcape. But had Tiſiphome or Megera, or their other ſiſter, whoſe name I have forgot, been preſent in their proper perſons, they could not have offered a more horrid ſight to the view of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Lorenzano than did the countenance of his own wife. I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe the ſcene that followed. Lorenzano attended the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031735_0031_0FEE28EE2F3E1208"/>
officer to the preſence of the judge, and was, upon a deliberate inveſtigation of the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, condemned to pay a fine of a thouſand doubloons to the page for the injury he had ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and a thouſand more as a ſatisfaction to the public for ſo flagrant breach of the peace.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had he crawled home, and paid the money, than his ears were ſaluted with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uproar in the ſtreet; an hundred women's voices were diſcernable that ſtruck the heart of our Knight with apprehenſion and diſmay. Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifania approached the window, and ſaw a crowd gathered round a woman whom they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying into a houſe.—This was the wife of an eminent baker in the city, who was paſſing by the houſe of Lorenzano at the very moment when, as ill luck would have it, the ſtring that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the eventful boots gave way, and down they came upon the head of this good lady, whom they brought along with them to the ground.</p>
               <p>"Oh the old hunks, cried the women! muſt he hang out his boots over the ſtreet to murder people as they paſs along—poor Mrs. Seſame, ſhe was three weeks gone with child, heaven knows if ſhe will get over it. If the old Jew is not well ſouſed for this, there is neither law nor juſtice in Mexico."</p>
               <p>Lorenzano found to his coſt, that there was no want of either; for he was fined in another
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031735_0032_0FEE28F76982A1F8"/>
thouſand doubloons, and the money given to the baker for the injury done to his wife.</p>
               <p>"Was ever man ſo puniſhed, ſaid Loronza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no for a pair of old boots! I beſeech you, ſaid he to the judge, for the love of God, to rid me of theſe accurſed inſtruments of my ruin; they have made me now the pooreſt man in Mexico. I leave them with you, and implore you to keep them, and preſerve me from utter deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The judge conſented, upon paying a certain ſum for the trouble of the depoſit; and thoſe famous jack-boots are now to be ſeen among the curioſities of Mexico, hung up as a monument of the baneful effects of <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty.</hi>

               <p>THERE is a ſort of enthuſiaſm in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſpirit, which renders it politically prudent in corrupt ſtateſmen to diſcourage it; and yet there is ſomething ſo great and ſo divine in this enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm, that ſtateſmen of a better turn, though they dare not encourage, yet cannot but admire it. We have a ſhining and ſurpriſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031735_0033_0FEE28F8F2623950"/>
of this in the cobler of Meſſina, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the laſt century, and is at once a proof that public ſpirit is the growth of every degree.</p>
               <p>This cobler was an honeſt man, and, I was going to ſay, poor; but when I conſider that he maintained his family, and was above depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I cannot prevail upon myſelf to make uſe of the expreſſion. He was alſo a man of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; He ſaw the corruption, luxury, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, the private frauds, the public robberies, the enormous violation of juſtice, under which his country laboured. He ſaw rapes unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, adulteries unreproved, barbarous murders either ſcreened by church ſanctuaries, or atoned for by money; in a word, he ſaw univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of manners, partly from the want of power in the government to chaſtiſe offenders. In this ſituation he reſolved to undertake the arduous taſk of reforming theſe diſorders, and thought it both lawful and expedient to aſſume the authority of avenger of the innocent, and the terror of the guilty.</p>
               <p>Full of this romantic reſolution, he provided himſelf with a ſhort gun, which he carried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his cloak; and equipped with a powder pouch on one thigh, and a bag of balls on the other, he ſallied out in the evenings, and as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per opportunities offered, he diſpatched ſuch as he knew to be incorrigible offenders to that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031735_0034_0FEE28FA79E43890"/>
where he was ſenſible they could not elude juſtice; and then returned home full of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which is the ſole reward of public ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. As there were in Meſſina a great number of theſe overgrown criminals, the cobler in the ſpace of a few weeks, did a great deal of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ſun never roſe without diſcovering freſh marks of his juſtice; here lay an uſurer who had ruined hundreds; there an unjuſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who had the curſe of thouſands; in one corner a nobleman who had debauched his friend's wife; in another, a man of the ſame rank, who through avarice and ambition, had proſtituted his own; but as the bodies were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways untouched, with all their ornaments about them, and very often with conſiderable ſums in their pockets, it was viſible they were not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched for the ſake of money: and their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers made it as evident that they did not fall vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims to private revenge.</p>
               <p>It is not in the power of words to deſcribe the aſtoniſhment of the whole city; things came at laſt to ſuch a paſs, that not a rogue of any rank whatever durſt walk the ſtreets; complaints upon complaint was carried to the viceroy; and magiſtrates, guards, ſpies, and every other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of power, were employed to no manner of purpoſe. At laſt, when no leſs than fifty of theſe examples had been made, the viceroy took
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031735_0035_0FEE290317BA8A08"/>
a ſerious reſolution of putting a ſtop to theſe miſchiefs, by the only method that ſeemed capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reaching the evil; he cauſed public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation to be made, that he would give the ſum of two thouſand crowns to any perſon who ſhould diſcover the author or authors of theſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, promiſing at the ſame time the like reward, with an abſolute indemnity, to the perſon who had done them, if he would diſcover himſelf; and as a pledge of his ſincerity, he went to the cathedral, and took the ſacrament, that he would punctually perform every tittle of his proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The cobler having either ſatisfied his zeal of juſtice, or being now in a temper to ſecure his own ſafety, after having, in his own opinion, done ſo much ſervice to the ſtate, went directly to the palace and demanded an audience of the viceroy, to whom, upon his declaring that he had ſomething of great importance to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, he was admitted alone. He began with putting his excellency in mind of his oath, who aſſured him he meant to keep it religiouſly. The cobler then proceeded to the following harangue: "I, Sir, have been alone that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of juſtice, who diſpatched in ſo ſhort a time ſo many criminals. In doing this, Sir, I have done no more than what was your duty to do. You, Sir, who in reality, are guilty of all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031735_0036_0FEE29049ECBED28"/>
which theſe wretches committed, deſerve the ſame chaſtiſement, and had met with it too, had I not reſpected the repreſentative of my prince, who, I know, is accountable to God alone." He then entered into an exact detail of all the murders he had done, and the motives upon which he had proceeded. The viceroy, who was thoroughly convinced that he told him no more than the truth, repeated his aſſurances of ſafety, and thanked him very affectionately for the tenderneſs he had ſhewn him, adding, after all, he was ready to pay him the 2000 crowns.</p>
               <p>Our cobler returned the viceroy his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his rough way; but told him, after what had paſſed, he believed it would be but pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in him to make choice of ſome other city for his habitation, and that too in ſome corner of Italy not under the juriſdiction of his Catholic majeſty. The viceroy thought his reaſons had weight, and, therefore, after thanking him in the moſt gracious terms for ſupplying that power which the government wanted, he ordered a tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane to tranſport him, his family, effects, and 2000 crowns, to one of the ports in the territory of Genoa; where this extraordinary perſon paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the remainder of his days in eaſe and quiet, and the city of Meſſina felt, for a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the good effects of his enthuſiaſtic zeal for the public good, and for the firſt execution of juſtice, without reſpect to perſons.</p>

This ſtory, however ſtrange, is exactly true, and, as Philip of Macedon kept a page, who to moderate his ambition, and to put him in mind of his duty, as a prince, was wont to awake him in the morning with this ſalutation, "Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Philip, that thou art a man;" ſo, I think, it would be happy for the miniſters, who are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entruſted by their maſters, or acquire to themſelves a boundleſs authority, ſupported by boundleſs influence; if they would write in a table book, and from thence refreſh their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories frequently with this ſentence, "What if the cobler of Meſſina ſhould revive?"</p>

               <p>THE ſeven ſtages of man, from the firſt dawn of life, to the gates of death, are thus deſcribed by Gratian, under the influence of the ſeven planets.</p>
               <p>Childhood is governed by the moon, and with her influences receives her perfections. Its light is faint and watery, without heat enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce diſtinct ideas. It is changeable too, and neither knows whatagrees or what appeaſes it—Yielding like wax to all impreſſions, and mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as paſte, it paſſes gradually from the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031735_0039_0FEE2913CCF4F0B8"/>
of total ignorance to a twilight of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>From ten to twenty, Mercury ſucceeds to the charge, inſpiring that docility with which the boy takes the learning that is given him, and too often that which he will wiſh to unlearn. He riſes in the ſchool, and fills his underſtanding with truth or falſhood, as chance determines the place of his education. At twenty Venus takes the ſceptre and reigns with tyranny till thirty, making cruel war againſt the youth, breathing unto him her hotteſt fires, and feaſting his imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination with ideas of gallanty and love.</p>
               <p>At thirty, the ſun riſes, and diffuſes that light and heat which warms and irradiates the meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man, and makes him pant for worth, fame, and diſtinction. He undertakes honourable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments with ſpirit, becomes ſolar orb to his family and country, and illuminates, ripens and perfects every thing.</p>
               <p>At forty, Mars owns him for his ſubject, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes into him courage rightly tempered, and gives him command in the field. He is punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilious, mettleſome, haughty, fierce and boiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: apt to quarrel, and ready to repel or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge an injury.</p>

with authority, does not take it well to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled by others, but aſpires after univerſal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; takes his reſolutions upon himſelf, and executes his own ſuggeſtions. In this ſtage rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and virtue are triumphant.</p>
               <p>At ſixty, the melancholy Saturn makes its night with man; his morning returns no more; but diſeaſe and ſullenneſs ſucceed. He ſees his own end near, and he wiſhes that the world may end with him. He lives tired by, and tiring every body, peeviſh and ſnarling, like an old cur, gnawing the preſent, and licking over the paſt. Languid and faultering in his ſpeech, ſlow to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, and ineffectual in his endeavours, ſordid and narrow in his expences, diſguſtful in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, careleſs of his dreſs, deſtitute of ſenſibility, complaining at all hours and of all things. Thus he lives on till ſeventy, and may perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times languiſh till eighty; but from thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all is pain and miſery, not life but living death.</p>

               <head>THE STORY OF CLARINDA; Containing many Remarkable Adventures.</head>
               <p>CLARINDA was neither born to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor poſſeſſed of the ſmalleſt ſhare of beauty, but in the early part of life applied herſelf ſo ſteadily to reading and the improvement of the mind, that it appeared ſhe deſigned to atone by the excellence of her underſtanding, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of her perſon. But when ſhe arrived to years of maturity, and became converſant with the world, either the flatteries which her wit procured her, or her natural vanity, engaged her to imagine her eyes had as much power as her underſtanding.</p>
               <p>She had naturally a great inclination for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, and her ſucceſs in one ſong attracted the notice of a young gentleman of very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fortune, who ſoon became enamoured of her happy talents in ballad writing. Clarinda attrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted the impreſſion, not to her poetry but her beauty; however, ſhe continued to furniſh him with ſuch productions as flattered his vanity and humoured his caprice; till at length, that ſhe might no longer miſtake the cauſe of her mighty influence over him, he preſented her with a purſe of an hundred guineas, and ſettled on her fifty
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031735_0042_0FEE291865E08C68"/>
pounds a year, in token of his regard to her poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical genius.</p>
               <p>This greatly enhancing her opinion of her own capacity, ſhe determined on quitting the country where ſhe then reſided, and repaired to London, the rendezvous of the gay, the young and the fair. Thus reſolved, ſhe ſent a perſon to Cambridge (from whence ſhe was diſtant but two miles) to take a place for her in the coach. It was her fortune to go up with a young ſtudent of the univerſity, whom we ſhall call Urbanus, who was himſelf an admirer of the muſes, and acquainted with moſt of the beaux eſprits in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of either ſex. Clarinda, by repeating ſome of her verſes, and her attracting deportment, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly engaged the young ſtudent in her ſervice.</p>
               <p>Being arrived in town, ſhe took leave of her new acquaintance at the inn, having been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before how ſhe might ſend to him as ſoon as ſhe was ſettled, which ſhe deſigned to do by his advice, as near Covent Garden as poſſible, that being a place whether the wits generally reſort. Accordingly, in a few days ſhe took a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel lodging in Southampton-ſtreet, where, when ſhe was fixed, Urbanus had ſoon notice, and as ſoon repaired to her abode. He gallanted her about to the female wits, and introduced all the male whom he thought worthy of her acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. It was not long before her lodgings were
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031735_0043_0FEE2923E97E2588"/>
the daily reſort of many who really had wit, and of more who deſired to be thought to have it, inſomuch that in the ſpace of about ſix months, ſhe had ingratiated herſelf into the favour of many of her own ſex of quality, as ſhe knew how to flatter them exquiſitely well; and the men of figure and quality, as well as thoſe of wit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly paid their attendance on the ladies at her apartment. Among the reſt, there was a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of great fortune, who was a perſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable vanity, that without either parts or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſet himſelf up as a prodigy for accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both of body and mind. Clarinda deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to avail herſelf of theſe foibles, in order, if poſſible to ſecure ſo valuable a prize, and as no method appeared ſo effectual as that of perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſhe was in love with him, ſhe ſent him a ſong to that effect, which pierced him through the very ſoul; and a mixture of vanity and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion made him reſolve to make the poeteſs his wife, whatever might be the conſequence. The wedding day was therefore appointed, and to make as little noiſe as poſſible, it was reſolved the nuptials ſhould be celebrated at a place between thirty and forty miles diſtant from London.</p>
               <p>Thus Clarinda by the force of her wit, from a ſtate of obſcurity rendered herſelf reſpected by the moſt ſenſible part of the town, and laid ſuch a foundation for happineſs in life, as nothing but the ſame cauſe could poſſibly deſtroy. She was
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031735_0044_0FEE29256F673930"/>
now miſtreſs of a reputable huſband, and a very good eſtate, which are two neceſſary ingredients in the compoſition of a woman's felicity. They lived in tolerable ſatisfaction in the country for about two months; but the ſeaſon of the year and Clarinda's extreme love of converſation, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this ſequeſtered life very diſagreeable, ſo that they repaired to London, and having taken an elegant houſe in Pall-mall, were viſited by the gay and airy from all quarters of the town.</p>
               <p>Would-be, (for that was her huſband's name) though poſſeſſed of ſo high an opinion of himſelf, was of a very jealous diſpoſition, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ſoon grew weary of ſuch a promiſcuous concourſe of men and women as his wife Clarin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da drew together. He likewiſe fancied that thoſe freedoms ſhe permitted to ſome of her male viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, whom ſhe called platonic lovers, was only a ſpecious pretext to cover more criminal concerns, and therefore firſt admoniſhed his lady, that her conduct was not agreeable to him; and when that would not prevail, he flatly informed her, that for the future his doors ſhould be ſhut againſt all manner of company.</p>
               <p>It would be tedious to recount the daily alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which this reſolution of Would-be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: ſuffice it therefore to obſerve, that from words the ſurly huſband proceded to blows; from blows to a ſeparation of beds, and from thence, in a few months, to a ſeparation of families.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:031735_0045_0FEE2926F6416F50"/>
Clarinda, however, applied to Doctor's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and having obtained a very handſome ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arate maintainance, fixed herſelf in new lodgings, which ſoon became the reſort of the gay and the witty.</p>
               <p>Urbanus, her firſt acquaintance, had been ſome time out of town, and therefore ignorant of the moſt important revolutions of her life, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the unſettled and various parts of it, ſince matrimony. He retained his love for her, and frequently expreſſed it; ſhe received it as her cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was, and permitted him to be her platonic admirer.</p>
               <p>Would-be, notwithſtanding the ſeparation, ſometimes viſited her, and happening to come at a time when Urbanus was kiſſing her, and ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his embraces with all the patience that ſhe could a huſband, the jealous madman, fired with indignation, drew his ſword, and at one paſs ſlew the unfortunate ſtudent. Clarinda, expecting the ſame fate, fled out of the room, and whilſt her huſband's rage purſued her, the houſe was alarmed, and Would-be taken into cuſtody for the murder of Urbanus.</p>
               <p>This was a melancholy effect of her follies, but the conſequence was moſt dreadful, ſince ſhe was compelled to be an evidence againſt her own huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and he was caſt by her evidence chiefly, the other being only circumſtantial.</p>
               <p>

diſpoſition. The day on which the deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was to be executed being arrived, the regiment, as is uſual on theſe occaſions, was drawn out to ſee the execution.</p>
               <p>It is the cuſtom on theſe occaſions for the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral corporals to caſt lots for this diſegreeable office: and when every one expected to have ſeen the lots caſt as uſual, they were ſurpriſed to find that the major had given orders, that the priſoner ſhould die by the hands of his own brother, who was only a private man in the ſame company; and who when the cruel order arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was taking his leave of his unhappy brother, and with tears faſt ſlowing, that expreſſed the anguiſh of his ſoul, was hanging for the laſt time about his neck</p>
               <p>On his knees did the poor fellow beg that he might not have a hand in his brother's death; and the poor priſoner, forgetting for a moment his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to heaven, begged to die by any hands but thoſe of a brother. The unrelenting officer, however, could by no means be prevailed on to revoke his cruel ſentence, tho' intreated to do ſo by every inferior officer of the regiment; but on the contrary, he ſwore that he, and he only, ſhould be the executioner, if it was merely for example ſake, and to make juſtice appear more terrible. When much time had been waſted in fruitleſs endeavours to ſoften the rigour of this
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031735_0048_0FEE29379D8C0A88"/>

               <p>The man had no ſooner diſcharged his piece, than throwing it on the ground, he exclaimed as follows:—"He that can give no mercy, no mercy let him receive. Now I ſubmit! I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die this hour for his death, than live an hundred years and take away the life of my brother." No perſon ſeemed to be ſorry for this unexpected piece of juſtice on the inhuman ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, and the man being ordered into cuſtody, many gentlemen preſent, who had been witneſſes of the whole affair, joined to intreat the officers to defer the execution of the other brother till the queen's pleaſure ſhould be known.</p>
               <p>This requeſt being complied with, the city chamber that very night drew up a very feeling and pathetic addreſs to her majeſty, ſetting forth the unparalleled cruelty and character of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed officer, and humbly intreating her majeſty's pardon for both the brothers.</p>

               <head>A MEMORABLE INSTANCE OF REAL LOVE.</head>
               <p>PHILARIO was the ſon of an Engliſh merchant, who had reſided long at Cadiz; he had been ſent young to England for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his education, at the royal college of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and while there, fell in love with Iſabella, the only daughter of a gentleman of good fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and eſtate, who had promiſed this lady to a diſtant relation of his own name; but ſhe had an averſion to the propoſed match, and openly avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her paſſion for Philario, which the father was ſo far from approving of, that being provoked by her oppoſition to his orders, he commanded her, under penalty of his diſpleaſure, never more to converſe with her lover.</p>
               <p>Iſabella, notwithſtanding this reſtraint found means to eſcape, and dreſſing herſelf in boy's cloaths, embarked with Philario, in a Spaniſh ſhip belonging to Briſtol, bound for the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But alas! human reſolutions are vain.—During the voyage they were taken by a Mooriſh ſhip belonging to Sallee; and 'tis eaſier to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive than expreſs, the affliction, the deſpair, the aſtoniſhment of Philario. He ſaw the beloved object of his affections now his partner in ſlavery, and he ſuffered more than death, every time that

his eyes all ſwimming with tears, ſtole a glance of his beloved Iſabella. But what aggravated his ſorrow, to the moſt piercing extremity, was an information he received of his father's death, and that all his effects had been ſeized by the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards.</p>
               <p>They paſſed about a week with the reſt of the ſhip's company, in a dungeon, where they were in continual expectation of that ſummons which muſt ſeparate them for ever. The moon one night ſhone clearly through the grates of the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on windows, and Philario, whilſt the others were aſleep, took notice of ſomething concealed in a corner of the room. He went and pulled it out and to his great ſurpriſe found ſeventy moidores, beſides ſmall pieces.</p>
               <p>He approached Iſabella, and awaked her in all the extacy of a man who conſidered himſelf as diſtinguiſhed by Providence. He whiſpered his new hope of an immediate redemption, and found means, by the help of an honeſt Jew, to be carried to the Alcaid; and truſting his gold with the Iſraelite, propoſed to ranſom himſelf and his beloved Iſabella, whom he called his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but the conflict of paſſions had ſo viſible an effect on his looks, that the magiſtrate took the advantage, and inſiſted on the whole ſum as the ranſom for one only, which was offered for both He bid him name either his brother or himſelf;

but adviſed him to loſe no time, as an Engliſh ſhip was to ſail out of the harbour in a few days with ranſomed captives. Philario trembled with fear, he knew not what to do; either he muſt go into ſlavery himſelf, or the dear partner of his life muſt be confined within the walls of a ſerag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.</p>
               <p>He went out with the Jew, and took a ſudden reſolution. But what was it? to pay the money for the ranſom of Iſabella, and remain in ſlavery himſelf. He communicated the fatal news to the perſon deareſt to him in the world; but what tongue can expreſs her agony; ſhe fell into ſtrong convulſions; but let mankind attend to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Providence.</p>
               <p>A Jew had lately arrived from Gibraltar, and having met with his brother Iſraelite, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation turned on the two captives, and it was agreed upon betwixt them to pay the ranſom, and accompany the lovers to their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>This affair being ſettled, they arrived in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; the ſons of Jacob were amply rewarded, the young lady was reinſtated in poſſeſſion of her father's fortune, and her huſband has now the honour to repreſent an opulent county in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <p>DURING Oliver Cromwell's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorſhip, a noiſy young officer, who had been bred in France, came to the ordinary at the Black Horſe in Holborn, where the perſon that uſually preſided at table was a rough old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhioned gentleman, who, according to the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of thoſe times, had been both major and preacher of a regiment. The young officer was vending ſome new-fangled notions, and ſpeaking, in his gaiety, againſt the diſpenſations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. The major, at firſt, only deſired him to ſpeak more reſpectfully of one for whom all the company had an honour; but finding him run on in his extravagance, began to reprimand him in a more ſerious manner. "Young man," ſaid he, "do not abuſe your Maker while you are eating his bread. Conſider whoſe air you breath, whoſe preſence you are in, and who it is that gave you the power of that very ſpeech which you make uſe of to his diſhonour" The young fellow, who thought to turn matters to a jeſt, aſked him. If he was going to preach? but at the ſame time deſired him to take care what he ſaid, when he ſpoke to a man of honour. "A man of honour!" ſays the major—"thou

art an infidel and a blaſphemer, and I ſhall uſe thee as ſuch." At length the quarrel ran ſo high, that the young officer challenged the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor. Upon their coming into the garden, the old fellow adviſed his antagoniſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the place into which one paſs might drive him; but finding him grow upon him to a degree of ſcurrility, as believing the advice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from fear: "Sirrah," ſays he, "if a thunderbolt does not ſtrike thee dead, before I come at thee, I ſhall not fail to chaſtiſe thee for thy prophaneneſs to thy Maker, and thy ſauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his ſervant." Upon this he drew his ſword, and cried with a loud voice, "<hi>The ſword of the Lord, and of Gideon;</hi>" which ſo terrified our young gentleman, that he was immediately diſarmed, and thrown upon his knees. In this poſture he begged for life, which the major re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to grant, before he had aſked pardon for his offence, in a ſhort prayer, which the major dictated upon the ſpot, and which his proſelyte repeated after him, in the preſence of the whole ordinary, that were now gathered about them in the garden.</p>

               <head>THE OLD PROVERB, Take a Wife down in her Wedding Shoes, exemplified in a pleaſant STORY.</head>
               <p>A GENTLEMAN in Lincolnſhire had four daughters, three of which were early mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried very happily; but the fourth, though no way inferior to any of her ſiſters, either in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or accompliſhments, had from her infancy, diſcovered ſo imperious a temper (uſually called a ſpirit) that it continually made great uneaſineſs in the family, became her known character in the neighbourhood, and deterred all her lovers from declaring themſelves. However, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, a gentleman of a plentiful fortune, and long acquaintance, having obſerved that quickneſs of ſpirit to be her only fault, made his addreſſes, and obtained her conſent, in due form. The lawyers finiſhed the writings (in which by the way, there was no pin-money) and they were married. After a decent time ſpent in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, the bridegroom went to prepare his ſeat for her reception. During the whole courſe of his courtſhip, though a man of the moſt equal temper, he had artificially lamented to her, that he was the moſt paſſionate creature breathing. By this one intimation, he at once made her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand warmth of temper to be what he ought
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031735_0059_0FEE2965E8DF5D18"/>
to pardon in her, as well as that he alarmed her againſt that conſtitution in himſelf. She at the ſame time, thought herſelf highly obliged by the compoſed behaviour which he maintained in her preſence. Thus far he with great ſucceſs ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her from being guilty of violences, and ſtill reſolved to give her ſuch a terrible apprehenſion of his fiery ſpirit, that ſhe ſhould never dream of giving way to her own. He returned on the day appointed for carrying her home; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a coach and ſix horſes, together with gay equipage ſuitable to the occaſion, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a ſervant, mounted on a ſkeleton of a horſe (which his huntſman had the day before bought in to feaſt his dogs on the arrival of his new miſtreſs) with a pillion fixed behind, and a caſe of piſtols before him, attended only by a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite hound. Thus equipped, he in a very obliging (but ſomewhat poſitive) manner, deſired his lady to ſeat herſelf upon the cuſhion; which done, away they crawled. The road being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by a gate, the dog was commanded to open it; the poor cur looked up and wagged his tail; but the maſter, to ſhew the impatience of his temper, drew a piſtol and ſhot him dead. He had no ſooner done it, but fell into a thouſand apologies for his unhappy raſhneſs, and begged as many pardons for his exceſſes before one for
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031735_0060_0FEE29676EF29DA0"/>
whom he had ſo profound a reſpect. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their horſe ſtumbled, but with ſome difficulty recovered; however, the bridegroom took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſwear, if he frightened his wife ſo again he would run him through; and, alas! the poor animal being now almoſt tired, made a ſecond trip; immediately on which, the careful huſband alights, and with great ceremony, firſt takes off his lady, then the accoutrements, draws his ſword, and ſaves the huntſman the trouble of killing him. Then, ſays he to his wife, "child, prithee take up the ſaddle;" which ſhe readily did, and tugg'd it home, where they found all things in the greateſt order, ſuitable to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and the preſent occaſion. Some time after, the father of the lady gave an entertainment to all his daughters and their huſbands, where, when the wives were retired, and the gentlemen paſſing a toaſt about, our laſt married man took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to obſerve to the reſt of his brethren, how much to his great ſatisfaction, he found the world miſtaken as to the temper of his lady, for that ſhe was the moſt meek and humble woman breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The applauſe was received with a loud laugh; but as a trial which of them would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the moſt maſter at home, he propoſed they ſhould all by turns ſend for their wives down to them.

But no ſooner was her huſbands deſire whiſpered in the ear of our laſt married lady, but the cards were clapped on the table, and down ſhe comes with, "my dear, would you ſpeak with me?" He received her in his arms, and after repeated careſſes tells her the experiment, confeſſes his good nature, and aſſures her, that ſince ſhe could now command her temper, he would no longer diſguiſe his own.</p>

               <p>When my name firſt began to be inſcribed upon glaſſes, I was honoured with the amorous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of the gay Venuſtulus; a gentleman who being the only ſon of a wealthy family, had been educated in the wantonneſs of expence, and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of effeminacy. He was beautiful in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and eaſy in his addreſs, and therefore ſoon gained upon my eye at an age <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> it is very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle over-ruled by the underſtanding. He had not any power in himſelf of pleaſing or amuſing, but ſupplied his want of converſation by treats and diverſions; and his chief act of courtſhip was to fill the mind of his miſtreſs with parties, rambles, muſic, and ſhows. We were often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſhort excurſions to gardens and ſeats, and I was for a while pleaſed with the care which Venuſtulus diſcovered, in ſecuring me from any appearance of danger, or poſſibility of miſchance. He never failed to recommend caution to his coachman, or to promiſe the waterman a reward
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031735_0065_0FEE297DAE352D88"/>
if he landed us ſafe; and his great care was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to return by day-light for fear of robbers. This extraordinary ſolicitude was repreſented for a time as the effect of his tenderneſs for me; but fear is too ſtrong for continual hypocriſy. I ſoon diſcovered that Venuſtulus had the cowardice as well as elegance of a female. His imagination was perpetually clouded with terrors, and he could ſcarcely refrain from ſcreams and outcries at any accidental ſurpriſe. He durſt not enter the room where a rat was heard behind the wainſcot, nor croſs a field where cattle were friſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſun-ſhine; the leaſt breeze that wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the river was a ſtorm, and every clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the ſtreet was a cry of fire. I have ſeen him loſe his colour when my ſquirrel had broke his chain; and was forced to throw water in his face on the ſudden entrance of a black cat. I was once obliged to drive away with my fan a beetle that kept him in diſtreſs, and chide off a dog that yelped at his heels, to whom he would gladly have given up me to facilitate his own eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. Women naturally expect defence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from a lover or a huſband, and therefore you will not think me culpable in refuſing a wretch, who would have burdened life with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary fears, and flown to me for that ſuccour, which it was his duty to have given.</p>

                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:031735_0066_0FEE297F3618E080"/>
My next lover was Fungoſo, the ſon of a ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jobber, whoſe viſits my friends, by the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of perſuaſion, prevailed upon me to allow. Fungoſo was indeed no very ſuitable companion, for having been bred in a compting-houſe he ſpoke a language unintelligible in any other place. He had no deſire of any reputation but that of an acute prognoſticator of the changes in the funds; nor had any means of raiſing merriment, but by telling how ſomebody was over-reached in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by his father. He was, however, a youth of great ſobriety and prudence, and frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us how carefully he would improve my fortune. I was in no haſte to conclude the match, but was ſo much awed by my parents that I durſt not diſmiſs him, and might perhaps have been doomed for ever to the groſſneſs of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and the jargon of uſury, had not a fraud been diſcovered in the ſettlement, which ſet me free from the perſecution of grovling pride and pecuniary impudence.</p>
               <p>I was afterwards ſix months without any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice, but at laſt became the idol of the glittering Floſculus, who preſcribed the mode of embroidery to all the fops of his time, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at pleaſure the cock of every hat; and the ſleeve of every coat, that appeared in faſhionable aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. Floſculus made ſome impreſſion upon my heart by ſuch compliments as few ladies can
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031735_0067_0FEE2980C25D6860"/>
hear without emotion: he commended my ſkill in dreſs, my judgment in ſuiting colours, and my art in diſpoſing ornaments. But Floſculus was too much engaged by his own elegance, to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently attentive to the duties of a lover. He expected to be repaid part of his tribute, and ſtaid away three days becauſe I neglected to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a new coat. I ſoon found that Floſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus was rather a rival than an admirer, and that we ſhould probably live in perpetual ſtruggle of emulous finery, and ſpend our lives in ſtratagems to be firſt in the faſhion.</p>
               <p>I had ſoon after the honour, at a feaſt, of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the eyes of Dentatus, one of thoſe human beings whoſe only happineſs is to dine. Denta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus regaled me with foreign varieties, told me of meaſures that he had laid for procuring the beſt cook in France, and entertained me with bills of fare, the arrangement of diſhes, and two ſauces invented by himſelf; at length, ſuch is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of human happineſs, I declared my opinion too haſtily upon a pye made under his own direction; after which he grew ſo cold and negligent, that he was eaſily diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p>Many other lovers, or pretended lovers, I have had the honour to lead a while in triumph. But two of them I drove from me by diſcovering they had no taſte or knowledge in muſic; three I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed becauſe they were drunkards; two, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031735_0068_0FEE298DD6FBE170"/>
they paid their addreſſes at the ſame time to other ladies; ſix, becauſe they attempted to influence my choice by bribing my maid; two more I diſcarded at the ſecond viſit for obscene alluſions; and five for drollery on religion. In the latter part of my reign, I ſentenced two to perpetual exile, for offering me ſettlements by which the children of their former marriage would have been injured; four for miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the value of their eſtates; three for conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their debts; and one, for raiſing the rent of a decrepit tenant.</p>
               <p>After all that I have ſaid, the reproach ought not to be extended beyond the crime, or either ſex to be condemned, becauſe ſome women or men are indelicate or diſhoneſt.</p>

               <head>LOVE'S INGENUITY; OR, CUPID'S CUNNING.</head>
               <head type="sub">Before the Marriage-Act took place a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nuptial ceremony was performed in a pleaſant village not far from Exeter.</head>
               <p>IN this village, one Mr. Placid occupied a pretty paternal ſeat, and a well cultivated fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily eſtate. His ſpouſe was what the world calls a good woman, that is, ſhe was neat, careful, and an excellent houſewife; but if we conſider the petulancy of her temper, ſhe was not ſo great a bleſſing as one might imagine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Placid had been bleſt by this lady with a beautiful daughter, named Juliana, adorned with every exterior charm, and embelliſhed with ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery polite accompliſhment; happy in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of her temper, and the benevolence of her heart; replete with all that could inſpire men with love, but devoid of that coquetiſh acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which creates envy in the boſom of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</p>
               <p>Mr Placid had for his near neighbour, one Doctor Prig, who poſſeſſed two fat livings in that part of the country, one of which was the pariſh where he reſided.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:031735_0071_0FEE2994E987D218"/>
Doctor Prig was the ſon of a dignified eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. In his childhood he had been ſpoiled in the nurſery, by the indulgence of his mother, who dying when he was about ten years of age, left him to the care of his ſurviving parent, who was too much wrapt up in his own importance, and the ſtudy of the father's to deſcend to the conſideration of his child's future welfare. He was therefore, to prevent trouble, ſent to a board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchool in the neighbourhood, where he was whipped into ſtupidity by the careful Mr Slaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, in order to make him a claſſical ſcholar. At the proper age he was removed to one of the univerſities, where he was lectured into pedantry, which, added to the profound reſpect he always entertained of his own abilities, very frequently rendered his company inſupportable.</p>
               <p>As Doctor prig viſited at Mr. Placid's, it is no wonder that the charms of Miſs Juliana made an impreſſion on his heart. He was forcibly ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten—declared his paſſion in form to the parents, and after due deliberation, it was affirmed by Mrs Placid, that the propoſal was too lucrative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elegible to be ſlighted. As Mr. Placid and his wife, were but one, according to the matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial law of nations, they never has but one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that is, Mr. Placid was always obliged to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt the opinion of his ſpouſe and call it his own, which prevented diſputes. Mrs. Placid
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031735_0072_0FEE299F16CCC2F0"/>
then being of opinion, that it ought to be a match, the hymenial plan of operations was ſettled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out once conſulting the young lady's inclinations, who happened to deſpiſe Doctor Prig with as ſupreme a contempt as her benevolent heart was capable of conceiving.</p>
               <p>At this critical period arrived Captain Affable, a diſtant relation of Mr. Placid's upon a viſit of a month. He had never ſeen Juliana ſince her childhood; he was ſtruck with the angelic bloom of her ripening beauties, a mutual tenderneſs ſwam in the eyes of each, and a ſympathetic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of ſpeaking glances gave intelligence to each of the ſituation of the other's heart; they were both, allowing for the difference of ſex, equally beautiful, and equally accompliſhed—And a ſecond ſighted ſeventh ſon of a ſeventh ſon would have ſworn that the recording angel of the Fates had written both their names in the ſame connubial line. As they were unſuſpected, they ſoon found an opportunity of ſpeaking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in private. Captain Affable had the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of ſincerity, Juiliana knew nothing of the diſtant ceremonial of modiſh coquetry; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his paſſion; ſhe confeſt her ſituation; they vowed a mutual conſtancy, and equally la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the avariciouſly abſurd intention of her parents. After determining upon their future conduct they parted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:031735_0073_0FEE29A09F333A78"/>
Capt. Affable next morning feigned an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute emergency to be abſent for the ſpace of four days; he rode poſt to London, procured a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial licence, and returned at his promiſed time.</p>
               <p>A few evenings after his arrival, Dr. Prig threw out ſeveral illiberal reflections and ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtical ſneers on the gentlemen of the army, which the captain <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>torted with ſome jokes on the pride and incapacity of the clergy. The diſpute grew warm, till after many aſſertions in disfavour of each party, the captain offered to wager the pedant that he could not repeat the requiſite official ceremonies of the church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a book. The Doctor accepted the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and deſired him to mention any cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in which he was not perfect, without Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric Aſſiſtance. The Captain named the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ceremony, at the ſame time with a ſneer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, that he did not believe he knew in what part of the ceremony to put on the ring. The Doctor, in his own juſtification, began to repeat the ceremony. A plain gold ring was produced, which Dr. Prig, impatient to vindicate his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and win the hundred guineas, in the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his ſpirits, placed on Juliana's finger, without reflecting on the conſequence. Mr. Placid, whoſe brain was not deſigned by nature for the diſcovery of plots, thought proper to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiate as father, imagining it would be unkind
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031735_0074_0FEE29A225AFC420"/>
to baulk the Doctor in his repetition, by ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to want ſo eſſential a perſonage in the ceremony. The Captain repeated thoſe parts appointed for the bridegroom, to prove that he did not deſign to baffle the Doctor by the double ceremonial's being omitted. And Juliana pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued each ſentence of the voluble eccleſiaſtic as bride, to ſhew herſelf diſintereſted in the affairs The ceremony was completed. The Captain owned his wager loſt, and entreated pardon for having ſuppoſed that ſo complete a gentleman could be deficient in any point whatever. All things were amicably adjuſted, the Doctor, after taking leave, retired to his own houſe, and the Captain ſeemingly to the apartment aſſigned him at Mr. Placid's; ſeemingly I ſay, for if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der does not already ſuppoſe, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for me to inform him that he that night took poſſeſſion of his lovely bride.</p>
               <p>The next morning the whole affair was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded to the parents; the ſpecial licence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; the validity of the marriage elucidated; and a bleſſing craved. Mrs. Placid, finding there was no alternative, gave it as her opinion that it would be proper to forgive the young people, as ſhe ſaid, for <hi>doing</hi> ſuch a trick, ſince it could not be <hi>undone.</hi> And Mr. Placid gave it (according to cuſtom) as his opinion, that her opinion was exactly right. A card was then diſpatched to
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031735_0075_0FEE29A6A60E85F0"/>
Dr. Prig, by which he underſtood that in the height of his cleverneſs he had married his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended bride to another. It enraged him ſo much, to think that a man of his conſummate wiſdom ſhould be ſo eaſily impoſed upon, that he fell ſick with paſſion, and did not again aſcend the pulpit for upwards of three months, when his flock was edified with ſeveral elaborate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, tending to cenſure the army in general and coquets in particular.</p>

               <head>A REMARKABLE STORY OF THE AFFECTION OF TWO BROTHERS.</head>
               <p>IN the beginning of the ſixteenth century the Portugueſe carracks ſailed from Liſbon to Goa; a very great, rich, and flouriſhing colony of that nation in the Eaſt-Indies. There were no leſs than twelve hundred ſouls, mariners, merchants, paſſengers, prieſts, and friars on board one of theſe veſſels. The beginning of their voyage was proſperous, they had doubled the Southern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of the great continent of Africa, called the Cape of Good Hope, and were ſhaping their courſe North Eaſt, to the great continent of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031735_0076_0FEE29AFF2F21D40"/>
when ſome gentlemen on board, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtudied geography and navigation (arts that reflect honour on the poſſeſſors) found in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude in which they were then ſailing, a large ridge of rocks laid down in their ſea charts. They had no ſooner made this diſcovery, but they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the captain of the ſhip with the affair, deſiring him to communicate the ſame to the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot; which requeſt he immediately gratified, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending him to lie by in the night, and ſlacked ſail by day, until they ſhould be paſt the danger. It is a cuſtom always among the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe, abſolutely to commit the ſailing part, on the navigation of the veſſel, to the pilot, who is anſwerable, with his head, for the ſafe conduct or carriage of the king's ſhips, or thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to private traders; and he is under no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of direction from the captain, who commands in every other reſpect.</p>
               <p>The pilot being one of thoſe ſelf-ſufficient men, who think every hint given from others, in the way of their profeſſion, as derogatory to their underſtanding, took it as an affront to be taught his art; and, inſtead of complying with the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's requeſt, actually crowded more ſail than the veſſel had carried before. They had not ſailed many hours, but juſt about the dawn of day a terrible diſaſter befel them, which would have been prevented if they had laid by:—the ſhip
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031735_0077_0FEE29B180291F58"/>
ſtruck upon a rock. I leave to the reader's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination, what a ſcene of horror this dreadful accident muſt occaſion among twelve hundred perſons, all in the ſame inevitable danger, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with fearful aſtoniſhment, that inſtantaneous death which now ſtared them in the face!</p>
               <p>In this diſtreſs, the captain ordered the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be launched; into which having toſſed a ſmall quantity of biſcuit, and ſome boxes of marmalade, he jumped himſelf, with nineteen others; who, with their ſwords, prevented the coming in of any more, leſt the boat ſhould ſink. In this condition, they put off into the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ocean, without a compaſs to ſteer by, or any freſh water, but what might happen to fall from the heavens, whoſe mercy alone could deliver them. After they had rowed four days, to and fro, in this miſerable ſituation, the captain, who had been for ſometime ſick and weak, died; this added, if poſſible, to their miſery; for, as they now fell into confuſion, every one would govern, and none would obey. This obliged them to elect one of their own company to command them, whoſe orders they implicitly agreed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. This perſon propoſed to the company to draw lots, and to caſt every fourth man overboard; as their ſmall ſtock of proviſion was ſo far ſpent, as not to be able, at a very ſhort allowance, to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain life above three days longer. They were
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031735_0078_0FEE29B3094B6118"/>
now nineteen perſons in all; in this number were a friar and carpenter, both of whom they would exempt, as the one was uſeful to abſolve and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them in their laſt extremity, and the other to repair the pinnance, in caſe of a leak, or other accident. The ſame compliment they paid to their new captain, he being the odd man, and his life of much conſequence. He refuſed this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence a great while, but, at laſt, they obliged him to acquieſce; ſo that there were four to die out of the ſixteen remaining perſons.</p>
               <p>The three firſt, after having confeſſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived abſolution, ſubmitted to their fate. The fourth whom fortune condemned was a Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe gentleman that had a younger brother in the boat, who ſeeing him about to be thrown overboard, moſt tenderly embraced him, and with tears in his eyes, beſought him to let him die in his room; enforcing his arguments, by telling him, that he was a married man, and had a wife and children at Goa, beſides the care of three ſiſters, who abſolutely depended upon him; that as for himſelf, he was ſingle, and his life of no great importance; he therefore conjured him to ſupply his place. The elder brother aſtoniſhed, and melting with this generoſity, replied, "That ſince the Divine Providence had appointed him to ſuffer, it would be wicked and unjuſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any other to die for him, eſpecially a brother
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031735_0079_0FEE29B490D65D20"/>
to whom he was ſo infinitely obliged." The younger, perſiſting in his purpoſe, would take no denial; but, throwing himſelf on his knees, held his brother ſo faſt, that the company could not diſengage them. Thus they diſputed for a while, the elder brother bidding him be a father to his children, and recommended his wife to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and as he would inherit his eſtate to take care of their common ſiſters; but all he could ſay did not make the younger deſiſt. This was a ſcene of tenderneſs that muſt fill any breaſt ſuſceptible of generous impreſſions, with pity.—At laſt, the conſtancy of the elder brother yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the piety of the other; he acquieſced and ſuffered the gallant youth to ſupply his place, who being caſt into the ſea, and a good ſwimmer ſoon got to the ſtern of the pinnance, and laid hold of the rudder with his right hand, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceived by one of the ſailors, he cut off the hand with a cutlaſs; then dropping into the ſea, he caught again hold with his left, which receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame fate by a ſecond blow; thus diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered of both hands, he made a ſhift, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to keep himſelf above water with his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This moving ſpectacle ſo raiſed the pity of the whole company, that they cried out "he is but one man, let us endeavour to ſave his life," and
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031735_0080_0FEE29C088618200"/>
he was accordingly taken into the boat; where he had his hands bound up as well as the place and circumſtances would permit. They rowed all that night, and next morning, when the ſun aroſe, as if heaven would reward the gallantry and piety of this young man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they deſcried land, which proved to be the mountains Mozambique, in Africa, not far from a Portugueſe colony.—Thither they all ſafely arrived, where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, until the next ſhips from Liſbon paſſed by, and carried them to Goa; at which city Linſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chotten, a writer of good credit and eſteem, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that he himſelf ſaw them land, ſupped with the two brothers, that very night, beheld the younger with his ſtumps, and had the ſtory from both their mouths, as well as from the reſt of the company.</p>

"My friend," ſaid the Duke, "I have; and becauſe I have a regard for you, I will give you the receipt in few words. "I never put off till to-morrow what may be done to-day; nor do I think any matter ſo trivial as not to deſerve notice." The Venetian thanked his Serene Highneſs for the ſecret; and by obſerving his rules, acquired a great eſtate.</p>

               <head>A WONDERFUL STORY.</head>
               <p>TOWARDS the latter end of Queen Ann's wars, Capt. John Beams, commander of the York merchant, arrived at Barbadoes from England. Having diſembarked all his lading, which conſiſted chiefly of coals, the ſailors, who had been employed in the dirty work, ventured into the ſea to waſh themſelves; they had not been long in the water before a perſon on board ſpied a ſhark making towards them, and gave them notice of their danger, upon which they ſwam back, and all of them, except one man, reached the boat in ſafety: him the monſter overtook, and griping him by the ſmall of the back, ſoon cut him aſunder and ſwallowed the lower part of his body: the remaining part was taken up and carried on board. The deceaſed had on board a dear and intimate friend, who no ſooner ſaw the remaining part of the lifeleſs trunk of his much lov'd companion, than he vowed to make the devourer diſgorge the other, or loſe his life in the attempt; then plunged inſtantly into the ſea: the ſhark beheld him, and made furiouſly towards him. Both were equally ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the one of his prey, the other to revenge his friend's untimely death. The moment the

ſhark opened his rapacious jaws, his adverſary dexterouſly diving, and graſping him with his left hand, ſomewhat below the upper fins, ſucceſsfully employed his knife in his right hand, giving him repeated ſtabs in the belly: the enraged ſhark, after many unavailing efforts, finding himſelf overmatched in his own element, endeavoured to diſengage himſelf; ſometimes plunging towards the bottom, ſometimes rolling on the ſurface of the waves. The crew of ſeveral ſurrounding veſſels beheld the unequal conflict, uncertain from which of the combatants the ſtreams of blood had flowed: till at length the ſhark, much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by the loſs of blood, made towards the ſhore. The ſailor now fluſhed with the hope of victory, puſhed his foe with redoubled ardour, and by the help of an ebbing tide, dragged him on ſhore, ripped open his bowels, and having united the ſevered carcaſe of his friend, laid both parts of the body in one hoſpitable grave.</p>

               <p>A FARMER on his return from the market, at Southam, in the county of Warwick, was murdered. A man went the next morning to his houſe, and enquired of the miſtreſs if her huſband came home the evening before; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied no; and that ſhe was under the utmoſt anxiety and terror on that account. "Your terror," added he, "cannot equal mine; for laſt night, as I lay in my bed quite awake, the apparition of your huſband appeared to me, ſhewed me ſeveral ghaſtly ſtabs in his body; told me he had been murdered by ſuch a perſon, and his carcaſe thrown into ſuch a marle pit." The alarm was given, the pit ſearched, the body found, and the wounds anſwered the deſcription of them. The man whom the ghoſt had accuſed, was apprehended and committed on a violent ſuſpicion of murder. His trial came on at War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, before the lord chief juſtice Raymond, when the jury would have convicted, as raſhly as the juſtice of peace had committed him, had not the judge checked them. He addreſſed himſelf to them in words to this purpoſe: "I think, gentlemen, you ſeem inclined to lay more ſtreſs on the evidence of an apparition, than it will
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031735_0088_0FEE29E160A16C90"/>
bear. I cannot ſay I give much credit to theſe kind of ſtories; but be that as it will, we have no right to follow our own private opinions here; we are now in a court of law, and muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined according to it; and I know not of any law now in being which will admit of the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of an apparition; nor yet if it did, doth the ghoſt appear to give evidence—Crier," ſaid he, "call the ghoſt," which was thrice done, but to no purpoſe, it appeared not. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the jury," continued the judge "the priſoner at the bar, as you have heard by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable witneſſes, is a man of the moſt unblem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed character, nor hath it appeared in courſe of the examination, that there was any manner of quarrel or grudge between him and the party deceaſed. I do believe him to be perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; and as there is no evidence againſt him either poſitive or circumſtantial, he muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted. But from many circumſtances which have aroſe during the trial, I do ſtrongly ſuſpect that the gentleman who ſaw the apparation, was himſelf the murderer; in which caſe he might eaſily aſcertain the pit, the ſtabs, &amp;c without any ſupernatural aſſiſtance; and, on ſuſpicion, I ſhall think myſelf juſtified in committing him to cloſe cuſtody, till the matter can be further enquired into" This was immediately done, and a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant granted for ſearching his houſe, when ſuch

               <p>A YOUNG gentleman going down from London to the weſt of England to the houſe of a worthy gentleman, to whom he had the honour to be related; it happened the gentleman's houſe at that time was full, by reaſon of a kinſwoman's wedding that had lately been kept there; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told the young gentleman, that he was very
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031735_0093_0FEE29F54A516738"/>
glad to ſee him, and that he was very welcome to him; but, ſaid he I know not how I ſhall do for a lodging for you; for my couſin's marriage has not left a room free, but one, and that is haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; you ſhall have a very good bed, and all other accommodations. Sir, replied the young gentleman, you will very much oblige me, in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me be there, for I have often coveted to be in a place that was haunted. The gentleman, very glad that his kinſman was ſo well pleaſed with his accommodation, ordered the chamber to be got ready, and a good fire to be made in it, it being winter time. When bed time came, the young gentleman was conducted up into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which, beſides a good fire, was furniſhed with all ſuitable accommodations; and having recommended himſelf to the divine protection, he goes to bed, where having kept ſome time awake, and finding no diſturbance, he fell aſleep; out of which he was waked, about three o'clock in the morning, by the opening of the chamber door, and the coming in of ſomething in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a young woman, having a night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs on her head, and only her ſhift on; but he had no perfect view of her, for his candle was burnt out. And though there was a fire in the room, yet it gave not light enough to ſee her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly. But this unknown viſitant going to the chimney, took the poker and ſtirred up the fire,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031735_0094_0FEE29F6D04AA398"/>
by the flaming light whereof, he could diſcern the appearance of a young gentlewoman more diſtinctly; but whether it was fleſh or blood, or any airy phantom, he knew not. This lovely appearance having ſtood ſome time before the fire, as if to warm her, at laſt walked two or three times about the room, and came to the bed-ſide, where having ſtood a little while, ſhe took up the bed-cloaths and went into bed, pulling the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloaths upon her again, and lay very quietly. The young gentleman was a little ſtartled at this unknown bed-fellow, and upon her approach, lay on the further ſide of the bed, not knowing whether he had beſt riſe or not. At laſt, lying very ſtill, he perceived his bed-fellow to breathe, by which, gueſſing her to be fleſh and blood, he drew nearer to her, and, taking her by the hand, found it warm, and that it was no airy phantom, but ſubſtantial fleſh and blood; and finding ſhe had a ring on her finger, he took it off unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; the gentlewoman being all this while aſleep, he let her lie without diſturbing her, ſhe flung off the bed-cloaths again, and getting up, walked three or four times about the room, as ſhe had done before; and then ſtanding ſome time before the door, opened it, went out, and ſhut it after her. The young gentleman, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by this in what manner the room was haunted, roſe up, and locked the door on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031735_0095_0FEE29FC0D7A3DB8"/>
and then lay down again, and ſlept till morning; at which time the maſter of the houſe came to him to know how he did, and whether he had ſeen any thing, or not? He told him, there was an apparition appeared to him, but begged the favour of him that he would not urge him to ſay any thing further, till the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were all together. The gentleman compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his requeſt, telling him, as long as he was well, he was very well ſatisfied. The deſire the whole family had to know the iſſue of this affair, made them dreſs with more expedition than uſual; ſo that there was a general aſſembly of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and ladies before eleven o'clock, not one of them being willing to appear in her diſhabille. When they were all got together in the great hall, the young gentleman told them, that he had one favour to deſire of the ladies before he could ſay any thing, and that was, to know whether any of them had loſt a ring? The young gentlewoman from whoſe finger it was taken, having miſſed it all the morning, and not knowing how ſhe loſt it, was glad to hear of it again, and readily owned ſhe wanted a ring, but whether loſt or miſlaid, ſhe knew not. The young gentleman aſked her if that was it, giving it into her hand, which ſhe acknowledged to be hers, and thanking him, he turned to the gentleman, the maſter of the houſe; "Now, Sir," ſaid he, "I can aſſure you," ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

This relation gave the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a great deal of diverſion; for, after all, the father declared that ſince his daughter had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gone to bed to his kinſman it ſhould be his fault if he did not go to bed to his daughter, he being willing to beſtow her upon him, and give her a good portion: this generous offer was ſo advantageous to the young gentleman, that he could by no means refuſe it; and his late bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow, hearing what her father had ſaid, was ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily prevailed upon to accept him for her huſband.</p>

               <head>THE GAMESTER.</head>
               <p>AT Tunbridge, in the year 1715, a gentleman, whoſe name was Hedges, made a very brilliant appearance; he had been married about two years to a young lady of great beauty and large fortune; they had one child, a boy, on whom they beſtowed all that affection which they could ſpare from each other. He knew nothing of gaming, nor ſeemed to have the leaſt paſſion for play; but he was unacquainted with his own heart; he began by degrees to bett at the tables for trifling ſums, and his ſoul took fire at the proſpect of immediate gain; he was ſoon ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with ſharpers, who with calmneſs lay in ambuſh for his fortune, and cooly took advantage of the precipitancy of his paſſions.</p>
               <p>His lady perceived the ruin of her family ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, but at firſt, without being able to form any ſcheme to prevent it. She adviſed with his brother, who at that time was poſſeſſed of a ſmall fellowſhip in Cambridge. It was eaſily ſeen, that whatever paſſion took the lead in her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's mind, ſeemed there to be fixed unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; it was determined therefore, to let him purſue his fortune, but previouſly take meaſures to prevent the purſuits being fatal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:031735_0098_0FEE2A0976818590"/>
Accordingly every night this gentleman was a conſtant attendant at the hazard tables; he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood neither the arts of ſharpers, nor even the allowed ſtrokes of a connoiſſeur, yet ſtill he played. The conſequence is obvious; he loſt his eſtate, his equipage, his wife's jewels, and every other moveable that could be parted with, except a repeating watch. His agony upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was inexpreſſible; he was even mean enough to aſk a gentleman, who ſat near, to lend him a few pieces, in order to turn his fortune; but this prudent gameſter, who plainly ſaw there was no expectations of being repaid, refuſed to lend a farthing, alledging a former reſolution againſt lending. Hedges was at laſt furious with the continuance of ill ſucceſs; and pulling out his watch, aſked if any perſon in company, would ſet him ſixty guineas upon it—the company were ſilent. He then demanded fifty—ſtill no anſwer. He ſunk to forty, thirty, twenty—finding the company ſtill without anſwering, he cried out by G—d it ſhall never go for leſs, and daſhed it againſt the floor, at the ſame time, attempting to daſh out his brains againſt the marble chimney-piece.</p>
               <p>The laſt act of deſperation immediately excited the attention of the whole company; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly gathered round, and prevented the effects of his paſſion; and after he again became cool,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031735_0099_0FEE2A57DBEA7430"/>
he was permitted to return home, with ſullen diſcontent, to his wife. Upon his entering her apartment, ſhe received him with her uſual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and ſatisfaction; while he anſwered her careſſes with contempt and ſternneſs; his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being quite altered with his misfortunes. "But my dear Jemmy," ſays his wife, "per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you don't know the news I have to tell; my mama's old uncle is dead, the meſſenger is now in the houſe, and you know his eſtate is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled upon you." This account ſeemed only to encreaſe his agony; and looking angry at her, cried, "There you lie, my dear, his eſtate is not ſettled upon me." "I beg your pardon, ſays ſhe, I really thought it was, at leaſt you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways told me ſo." "No," returned he, as ſure as you and I are to be miſerable here, and our children beggars hereafter, I have ſold the rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it this day, and have loſt every farthing I got for it at the hazard table. "What, all," replied the lady, "Yes, every farthing, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he, "and I owe a thouſand pounds more than I have to pay." Thus ſpeaking, he took a few frantic ſteps acroſs the room. When the lady had a little enjoyed his perplexity, "No, my dear, cried ſhe, you have loſt but a trifle, and you owe nothing; our brother and I have taken care to prevent the effects of your raſhneſs, and

Her prudence had the proper effect, he ever after retained a ſenſe of his former follies, and never played for the ſmalleſt ſums, even for amuſement.</p>

               <head>THE REWARD OF BRAVERY.</head>
               <p>IN the reign of queen Ann, captain Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whoſe ſhip was ſtationed at Lagos bay; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to receive undoubted advice of the arrival of the Spaniſh galleons under the convoy of 17 men of war, in the harbour of Vigo; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any warrant for ſo doing ſet ſail, and made ſuch expedition that he came up with Sir George Rook, who was then admiral and commander in chief in the Mediterranean, and gave him that intelligence, which engaged him to make the beſt of his way to Vigo, where all the before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed galleons and men of war were either taken or
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031735_0101_0FEE2A147A8D74C8"/>
deſtroyed. Sir George was ſenſible of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the advice, and the ſucceſsful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the captain; but after the fight was over, the victory obtained, and the proper ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages made of it, the Admiral ordered Capt. Hardy on board; and with a ſtern countenance, "You have done, Sir, ſaid he, a very important piece of ſervice to the queen; you have added to the honour and riches of your country by your diligence; but don't you know you are at this inſtant liable to be ſhot for quitting your ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?" "He's unworthy to bear a commiſſion under her majeſty, replied the captain, who holds his own life as aught, when the glory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of his queen and country requires him to hazard it." On this heroic anſwer, the admiral diſpatched him home with the firſt news of the victory, and letters, of recommendation to the queen, who inſtantly knighted him, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made him a rear admiral.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance of the reward of bravery, was of the prince of Conte, who being highly pleaſed with the intrepid behaviour of a grenadier at the ſiege of Phillipſburgh, in 1734, threw him his purſe, excuſing the ſmallneſs of the ſum it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, as being too poor a reward for his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.

               <p>THE dreadful conſequences of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſubjection to any of the baſer paſſions, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt daily obvious to thoſe who remark the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon incidents of human life. Indeed all the ills which befal mankind ariſe from their vices; and however partial we may be to ourſelves, if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine candidly into our conduct and behaviour, we ſhall find that our errors or follies have been the principal ſource of any diſagreeable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that do or have attended us. The irregularities of youth generally produce a train of evils through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſucceeding years, and that may be done in a ſingle hour, which may afford cauſe of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance till, and at the very day of death. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031735_0103_0FEE2A178E681C40"/>
that paſſions are more abſurdly and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly indulged by perſons paſt the meridian of life, than by thoſe in its bloom and vigour though the latter muſt feel them more ſenſibly and have certainly more juſtifiable pleas for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
               <p>I was led into this ſubject by reflecting on an occurence, which happened ſome few years ago to two perſons of my acquaintance, for whom I had a very great eſteem. In tracing this affair, we ſhall ſee the complicated effects of an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection, and undue revenge, which for want of being kept under by the check of reaſon, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt themſelves, and proved the ruin of a very worthy family.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Foible, a widow lady, had one only daughter, to whom ſhe was greatly attached, as ſhe not only poſſeſſed many mental and perſonal charms, but was remarkably dutiful to her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and polite and affable in her general behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour. As her fortune was very ſmall, ſhe had no reaſon to think of matching her daughter with any perſon above the degree of a reputable tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; nor indeed, were her views exalted beyond the bounds of reaſonable probability. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time the daughter, Maria, received the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of a young man of much honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, juſt out of his time, but whoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were not ſufficient to ſet him up in buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031735_0104_0FEE2A206FCBBF90"/>
Mrs. Foible, therefore, objected to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between two people who could have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but poverty before them; becauſe the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of her money was hardly ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her decently, and therefore would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any reduction by a diſburſement in favour of her daughter. However, as it was their firſt love, the young people kept up an intercourſe, and their affection growing with their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, after ſome time they vowed eternal and mutual conſtancy.</p>
               <p>The young man ſincere, and induſtrious, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed marriage, and offered his beſt endeavours to maintain the darling of his ſoul with decency and comfort; before they had fixed on the day it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately happened, that a relation of Mrs. Foi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble's died, and bequeathed her 1000l. and Maria, 500l. The mother elated by this increaſe of fortune, began to ſet a higher value on herſelf; and endeavoured to diſſuade her daughter from the propoſed match, repreſenting it not only as beneath her, but that it might obſtruct ſome more advantageous and honourable connection. But the generous girl, endued with much more noble ſentiments than her mother, was deaf to all her diſſuaſions; urged, that ſhe was bound by the ties of honour and juſtice, to marry the man who would have taken her without a ſhilling, and uſed ſuch powerful arguments, in vindication of
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031735_0105_0FEE2A21F8923938"/>
her reſolution, that they were ſoon married with conſent of all parties. The behaviour of the new married couple greatly pleaſed Mrs. Foible, inſomuch that the ſon-in-law, having occaſion for an additional ſum to carry on a very extenſive branch of buſineſs in which he had embarked, applied to his mother for the loan of 200l. with which ſhe moſt chearfully complied, aſſured him that ſhe would never demand the capital provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe received the intereſt for her ſupport. But this turn of mind in the widow ſoon changed; for in a ſhort time ſhe became want only enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of an Iriſh fortune hunter, and married him contrary to the advice of all her friends. She was now totally changed, and from the tender mother, had degenerated into the thoughtleſs woman of diſſipation and indulgence, without the leaſt rule of reaſon or reſtraint.</p>
               <p>An expenſive courſe ſoon reduced the ſtate of her finances, which occaſioning her ſon-in-law, as well as daughter, to intimate to her their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of her conduct; ſhe began to conceive a moſt violent reſentment againſt them. The poor young fellow, on his mother's aſſuring him ſhe ſhould never demand the money, had diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of it in trade, in ſuch a manner that he could not return it immediately without injuring him moſt eſſentially in his buſineſs, and therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended a moſt diſtreſsful ſcene from its being called in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:031735_0106_0FEE2A250CF31040"/>
Nor were his fears without foundation; for the frantic mother, diſtreſſed through her own follies, and the extravigance of an abandoned huſband, not only demanded the money to be immediately reſtored, but determined to heap her revenge on the young couple; gave out that ſhe had been ruined by ſupporting her ſon-in-law in his ambitious, expenſive undertaking. This diſingenuous report alarmed his creditors; a ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute of bankruptcy was brought into the houſe, on the very day that his wife was delivered of a child; and affected her in ſo poignant a manner, that ſhe died in a few hours after that doleful event. But it appearing on a review that there was more than ſufficient to ſatisfy the legal demands of his creditors, the unhappy young man was treated with great generoſity, and enabled to purchaſe a commiſſion, and depart honourably for the Eaſt-Indies. The weak and vicious mother atoned moſt amply for her vice and folly, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of her own guilt, her peace of mind was ſacrificed; and her huſband, when all was ſpent, treated her with the utmoſt cruelty, upbraided her with her ridiculous fondneſs, and at length left her to ſhift for herſelf. Thus ſituated ſhe had no other reſource than that of a workhouſe, where ſhe expired with grief, about a year after ſhe had, at the inſtigation of the baſeſt of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, involved her dutiful children as well as her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in remedileſs woe and ruin.</p>

Nothing ſurely can afford a more lively repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of imprudence and revenge, than this narrative. If Mrs. Foible had continued in a ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation becoming her years and connections, ſhe would have been happy in her own reflections, and might have rendered thoſe happy who ſhould have been deemed the only objects of her care and attention.</p>

               <head>THE PREVALENCE OF LOVE, AND OF PASSION.</head>
               <p>DON Guzman, a wealthy merchant in the city of Madrid, was father to Juan, a youth of ſenſe and honour, and guardian to the Lady Leonora whoſe beauty was only exceeded by the virtues of her mind.</p>
               <p>The ſon and ward conceived for each other in their earlieſt years, a friendſhip which, in proceſs of time, terminated in the ſincere love and moſt cordial affection, and ſuch were their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective diſpoſitions, as to afford the agreeable proſpect of a ſeries of uninterrupted happineſs. But an event occurred before the conſummation of their wiſhes, which caſt a gloom over all their pleaſing hopes, and produced the moſt exquiſite
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:031735_0108_0FEE2A2C0B86AF00"/>
pain and anxiety, that can poſſibly torture the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind.</p>
               <p>The Marquis de Mendoſa ſaw the beautiful Leonora, and was ſo ſtruck with the luſtre of her charms, that he determined at all events to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her in marriage. As he was extremely rich and had very great influence at court, he prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Guzman to permit his addreſſes to the lady, notwithſtanding her prior engagement with his own ſon Juan, for whom it was ſuſpected he had procured a perſon of much greater fortune than his fair and virtuous ward.</p>
               <p>Though Guzman determined to ſacrifice Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora to the will of the Marquis, he was at a loſs whether he ſhould acquaint his ſon, that he had changed his mind concerning the match, or whether he ſhould impart it to him by ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon friend. At length, however, thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the propereſt perſon to diſcloſe the affair, he took an opportunity of telling him, that for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers weighty reaſons he muſt reſign all thoughts of poſſeſſing Leonora. Don Juan was thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck, at the information, and gave his father to underſtand, that though he owed him all duty and obedience, he could by no means relinquiſh a claim to which he was entitled by every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion founded on juſtice or honour. Having hinted this, the generous youth retired to his chamber to avoid the preſſing inſtances of his
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:031735_0109_0FEE2A35B5377960"/>
father, who afterwards ſent for Leonora, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted her with the paſſion that the noble Marquis had conceived for her, and his deſign of aggrandizing her name by a ſpeedy marriage into ſo ancient and honourable a family. Leonora ſtarted at the propoſal, and ſolemnly vowed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal celibacy, unleſs ſhe gave her hand to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous and conſtant Juan, who was ſole poſſeſſor of her heart, which therefore could not admit the ſmalleſt place for the greateſt monarch upon earth. Guzman, incenſed at the reſolution of his ward, proceeded to more vigorous meaſures, and after a very ſevere reprimand for her obſtinacy, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to prepare herſelf to receive a viſit from the Marquis of Mendoſa, as a perſon with whom ſhe was allotted to ſpend the remainder of her life, and further enjoined her to deny the addreſſes of Juan. This laſt injunction completed her deſpair, and her grief was almoſt turned to fury, inſomuch that ſhe departed from her guardian's apartment, in order to give full vent to the ſorrow which overwhelmed her faithful boſom. She had for ſome time paſt obſerved a coolneſs between Juan and his father, and now perceiving the cauſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to write to him, wiſely judging that a perſonal interview at this critical juncture would inflame the old man's reſentment, and excite him to ſuch a conduct as would be productive of much diſquiet both to herſelf and lover. Accordingly
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031735_0110_0FEE2A374262BF90"/>
ſhe acquainted him of the injunction laid upon her not to receive his addreſſes, and painted the ſtate and condition of her mind in the moſt ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and affecting colours. The domeſtic who delivered the letter brought back an anſwer, in which Don Juan conjured her by the love ſhe had for him not to forget him, and aſſured her that his life was in her hands, nor would he hold it by any other tenure than her conſtancy.</p>
               <p>As Don Juan, who was at this time on his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's buſineſs, abſent from Madrid, could not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford her immediate aſſiſtance, Leonora deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go into a convent; and having impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her deſign to her waiting maid, a coach was prepared, which ſoon conveyed her to an abbey, of which the abbeſs was her relation and partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular friend. Guzman no ſooner heard of his ward's elopement and the ſpot of her reſidence, than through the intereſt of the Marquis, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained permiſſion to place in the convent a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that was one of his creatures, in order to be a ſpy upon Leonora: the nuns were likewiſe ordered to prevent any correſpondence between her and Don Juan. The Marquis ſent to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly to deſire permiſſion to viſit her at the grate, but ſhe always refuſed, and not without tokens of ſcorn. Incenſed at this behaviour, he determined to marry her merely to gratify his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and after deliberating on the means of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031735_0111_0FEE2A38C8862CB8"/>
accompliſhing his deſign, thought no expedient ſo effectual as that of removing Juan to a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtance from Leonora, nor was it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fortune preſented a favourable opportunity. The lover, notwithſtanding the precautions of his father, and the vigilence of the woman placed by him in the convent as a ſpy upon his ward, had found means to correſpond with her by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo that it was agreed through the aſſiſtance of the nun who was her confident, that Juan ſhould come in the night time over a particular part of the garden wall, that was not ſo high as the reſt, and return after his viſit the ſame way.</p>
               <p>The enraptured youth eagerly repaired to the ſpot appointed, but to his confuſion and aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment had no ſooner mounted the wall than he eſpied a perſon walking with two attendants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, in the ſtreet next to the garden. This perſon anxiouſly deſirous of knowing who had got into the convent, ſent for the watch, which he poſted at the very place where he imagined he was to come back. Having made this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the Marquis de Mendoſa, for he was the perſon, ſent to acquaint the nuns that there was a man in the garden. While the lovers, little ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the freſh misfortune that was ready to fall upon them, were giving each other the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal marks of their affection, they heard a confuſed noiſe in the convent, which obliged them
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031735_0112_0FEE2A3C84C22F78"/>
to ſeparate. Don Juan haſtened over the wall, but was no ſooner down, than two men ruſhed upon him, took away his ſword, and in the king's name charged him to follow them. The captain of the guard cauſed him to be committed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and drew up an information againſt him, which was next day laid before the ſolicitor general.</p>
               <p>Don Juan now imagined that his ruin was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, the violation of the walls of a convent being in Spain conſidered as a capital offence. His death indeed appeared inevitable, and the affair became the common topic of diſcourſe through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the metropolis, where Don Juan was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally beloved; all men of honour pitied his caſe, and ſolicited for him, but with ſmall hopes of ſucceſs. Don Guzman and the Marquis now came to a reſolution of propoſing to Leonora, as the king favoured the deſign, this alternative; either to ſave the life of Juan by conſenting to wed Mendoſa, or haſten his death by an obſtinate refuſal. A propoſal of ſo delicate and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant a nature could not but greatly embarraſs the diſtreſſed fair one, who evinced every token of doubt and anxiety, and at length burſt into this exclamation: "If this is the only way of ſaving the life of Don Juan, I rather chuſe to die with him, as I am well aſſured he loves me too well to conſent to live upon ſuch terms, and would grieve that I had prevented his death by ſuch a conceſſion!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="unknown:031735_0113_0FEE2A45CEF61018"/>
The Marquis, enraged at her perſeverance, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that as ſhe was willing that Don Juan ſhould die, he would join with the nuns in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting him, and aſſiſt thoſe who ſought his ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. This declaration touched Leonora in the moſt ſenſible part, inſomuch that her reſolution failing, ſhe conſented, in order to ſave the life ſhe held moſt dear, and having ſlowly uttered, "Save the life of Don Juan, I will obey," faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Marquis procured her relief, and when ſhe recovered, ſhe deſired to be carried to her chamber.</p>
               <p>The pardon was accordingly procured for Juan, but, previous to the delivery, Mendoſa be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for concluding the marriage, the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Leonora was wedded to his mortal enemy, whom nevertheleſs ſhe conſidered as his deliverer.</p>
               <p>Don Juan heard nothing of theſe tranſactions in the priſon, where he was abandoned to the moſt melancholy reflections, ſo that he waited with impatience the time of his death; and the thoughts of its approach was the only comfort he had, when the news was brought that the king had ſigned his pardon. On his being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the terms, deſcription cannot paint the agitation of his ſoul, as the various impreſſions conſequent upon it ſeemed as it were to have broken the very ſprings which put it in motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="unknown:031735_0114_0FEE2A475588AE18"/>
The perſon who acquainted him with Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's marriage, endeavoured to pacify him by a vindication of her conduct, giving him a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar detail of what his unfortunate miſtreſs had ſuffered, and of the neceſſity to which ſhe was reduced, of giving her hand to the Marquis of Mendoſa.</p>
               <p>The generous youth ſtood motionleſs for ſome time, till at length the paſſion he had for Leono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra having recovered entire poſſeſſion of his ſoul, he cried out in a plaintive tone, "Alas! why has ſhe loved me to ſuch a degree? or rather why did ſhe not let me die? what ſhall I do with a life I ſo much hate?"</p>
               <p>While Don Juan was thus complaining, the officers of Juſtice came to ſet him at liberty; and he no ſooner reached his own habitation, than he wrote to Leonora, expreſſing the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the late tranſaction, and his unfeigned deſire of the ſatisfaction of dying at her feet. She returned an immediate anſwer, modeſtly vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her late conduct, and repreſenting the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of granting the favour requeſted.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate Juan was ſo affected by this circumſtance, that he reſolved to indulge melancholy till it put an end to his misfortune, and accordingly ſhut himſelf up at home, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his time in venting the bittereſt complaints againſt the ſeverities of his fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:031735_0115_0FEE2A48E06A85E0"/>
While he was in this ſituation, a ſtranger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſpeak with him, and was no ſooner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his apartment, than he declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have been the ſervant of the Marquis of Mendoſa, that his maſter had diſcovered him when he got into the convent, ſent him immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to give notice of it to the nuns, and poſted the watch under the wall, by whom he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted.</p>
               <p>The injured Juan, who could not ſtifle his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment a ſingle moment, immediately ſent the Marquis a challenge, couched in ſuch terms as he could not refuſe without bringing an eternal ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma on his character; it being therefore accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the antagoniſts met, and without any parley drew their ſwords and fought moſt furiouſly. After a ſtrenuous encounter, Juan determining to put an end by one puſh, to a duel which had laſted ſo long, made a full paſs at the Marquis, and run him into the breaſt; but received at the ſame time a ſtab in the bottom of his belly, which was altogether as dangerous. Both of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants loſt ſo much blood that they could no longer ſtand on their feet, but fell down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moment that a coach came up to them. This proved to be the carriage of Leonora, who having ſeen the challenge upon the table, had haſtened with all ſpeed to prevent the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Words cannot expreſs the divided
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031735_0116_0FEE2A4D0E681858"/>
ſtate of the unfortunate Leonora's mind in this critical ſituation. Duty engaged her to ſupport her huſband; affection diverted her attention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her lover; ſhe ſhed tears in abundance while ſhe was ſtopping the blood that flowed from the wounds of her huſband; nor were the tears leſs ſincere that were ſhed for the wounds of Don Juan, which continued bleeding. But the principal ſource of her grief was the neceſſity ſhe was under of leaving her lover in that condition: love, however, at length prevailed over decorum; and ſhe ſtaid till a ſervant whom ſhe had ſent to the convent of the Carthuſians, brought ſome of the nuns attendants, who carried Don Juan to the convent.</p>
               <p>Though no audible converſe paſſed upon this occaſion between Leonora and Juan, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis could not but perceive the cauſe of his wife's delaying her return home, nor could any thing but the langour conſequent on the duel prevent him from reproaching her in the ſevereſt terms. The duel was well known at court; but as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their wounds proved mortal, juſtice took no cognizance of the matter, and there was no proſecution.</p>
               <p>When the Marquis recovered from his wounds, ſuch continual diſputes happened between him and his ſpouſe, who could not bear the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity offered to the name of her beloved Juan,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:031735_0117_0FED3815DA125CB8"/>
that a ſeparation being agreed upon, Leonora betook herſelf to a ſolitary retirement in order to indulge her reflections on the extraordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes through which ſhe had paſſed, before ſhe had attained to the age of five and twenty years. Don Juan, whoſe love though paſſionate was honourable, and therefore would not ſuffer him to make the leaſt indign propoſal to its object, determined to quit Madrid, and had almoſt finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the neceſſary preparations for his departure, when he received the news that the Marquis, in a fit of jealouſy, rage and deſpair, had plunged a fatal javelin into his breaſt, and in a moment put a period to a more wretched exiſtence. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance ſo affected old Guzman, that ſenſible of his error in preventing, for a time at leaſt, a union deſigned by heaven, he haſtened to his ſon, and himſelf conducted him to his beauteous bride, and ſoon after joined their hands to the general joy of the family, and the whole city of Madrid.</p>

               <head>THE FOLLY OF DISCONTENT.</head>
               <p>I AM inclined to think that the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, as they are termed, of life, are not ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten owing to the want of care, as the having too much, and being over ſollicitous to acquire, what nature, the great ſubſtitute of heaven, would ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for us, if we would be contented to follow her dictates. The brutes, led on by that inward impulſe we call inſtinct, never err in their purſuit of what is good for them; but man, enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon, and particular marks of Providence, which diſtinguiſhes him from the reſt of beings, obſtinately refuſes to be conducted to happineſs, and travels towards miſery with labour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue. 'T would be abſurd to ſay a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would voluntarily chuſe miſery, but we too frequently do it blindly. Every thing, as the philoſophical emperor obſerves, is fancy; but as that fancy is in our own power to govern, we are juſtly puniſhed if we ſuffer it to wander at will; or induſtriouſly ſet it to work to deceive us into uneaſineſs. The moſt ſure and ſpeedy way to detect any mental impoſtor, is by ſoliloquy or ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination, in the way laid down by our great reſtorer of antient learning: if our fancy ſtands the teſt of this mirror, which repreſents all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

in their true colours, 'tis genuine, and may be accepted by the mind with ſafety; but if it recedes from the trial, or changes in the attempt, 'tis ſpurious, and ought to be rejected. This will inform us, that the great miſtake of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in their purſuit after happineſs, is caſting their looks at a diſtance for lands of paradiſe, whilſt the proſpect, ſo much ſought after, blooms unbeheld around them.</p>
               <p>At Iſpahan in Perſia, there lived a young man of a noble family and great fortune, named Ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot, who from his infancy ſhewed the earlieſt ſigns of a reſtleſs turbulent ſpirit; and though by nature endowed with an underſtanding ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to any of his age, was led away with every guſt of paſſion to precipitate himſelf into the greateſt dangers. After having experienced the misfortune, that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> from ſuch a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he became ſomewhat more diffident of his own abilities, and determined to take the advice of thoſe who had been more converſant with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human nature, how to proceed for the future. There dwelt not far from the city, in a little cell among a ridge of mountains, an old hermit, who many years before had retired from the world to that place, to ſpend the reſt of his days in prayer and contemplation. This good man became ſo famous through the country for his exemplary life, that if any one had any uneaſineſs of mind,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031735_0120_0FEE2A5C8F6E3DB8"/>
he immediately went to Abudah, for ſo he was called, and never failed of receiving conſolation, in the deepeſt affliction, from his prudent coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; which made the ſuperſtitious imagine, that there was a charm in the ſound of his words to drive away deſpair and all her gloomy attendants. Hither Achmet repaired, and as he was entering, a grove, near the ſage's habitation, met, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his wiſhes, the venerable recluſe; he proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated himſelf before him, and with ſigns of the utmoſt anguiſh, "Behold, ſaid he, O divine Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, favourite of our mighty prophet, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth Allha, by diſtributing the balm of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the diſtreſſed, behold the moſt miſerable of mortals." He was going on, when the old man, deeply affected with his lamentations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted him, and taking him by the hand, "Riſe, my ſon, ſaid he, let me know the cauſe of thy misfortunes, and whatever is in my power ſhall be done to reſtore thee to tranquility." "Alas!" replied Achmet, "how can I be reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored to that which I never yet poſſeſſed! For know, thou enlightened judge of the faithful, I never have ſpent an eaſy moment that I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, ſince reaſon firſt dawned on my mind; hitherto even from my cradle, a thouſand fancies have attended me through life, and are contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually, under the falſe appearances of happineſs, deceiving me into anxiety, whilſt others are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying

Tell me then I conjure thee by the holy temple of Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, from whence thy prayers have been ſo often carried to Mahomet by the miniſters of Paradiſe, by what method I may arrive, if not at the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred tranquility thou enjoyeſt, yet at the harbour of ſuch earthly peace as the holy Koran hath promiſed to all thoſe that obey its celeſtial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts; for ſure the damned, who remove alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately from the different extremes of chilling froſts and ſcorching flame, cannot ſuffer greater torments than I undergo at preſent." Abudah perceiving that a diſcontented mind alone was the ſource of the young man's troubles: "Be comforted, my ſon," ſaid he, "for a time ſhall come, by the will of heaven, when thou ſhalt receive the reward of a true believer and be freed from all thy misfortunes; but thou muſt ſtill undergo many more, before thou canſt be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with the truly happy. Thou enquireſt of me where happineſs dwells. Look round the world, and ſee in how many different ſcenes ſhe has taken up her reſidence; ſometimes, though very rarely, in a palace; often in a cottage. The philoſopher's cave of retirement, and the ſoldier's tent amidſt the noiſe and dangers of war, are by turns her habitation; the rich man may ſee her in his treaſures, and the beggar in his wallet. In all theſe ſtations ſhe is to be found,

but in none altogether Go then and ſeek thy fortune among the various ſcenes of the world, and if thou ſhouldſt prove unſucceſsful in this probationary expedition, return to me when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years are expired, when the paſſions of youth begin to ſubſide, and I will inſtruct thee by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious emblem, which our great prophet ſhewed me in a dream, how to obtain the end of all thy wiſhes." Achmet, not underſtanding Abudah's meaning, left him as diſcontented as he came, and returned to Iſpahan with a full reſolution of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying every inclination of pleaſure and ambition, imagining one of theſe muſt be the road to felicity. Accordingly he gave up his firſt years entirely to thoſe enjoyments which enervate both body and mind; but finding at length no real ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in theſe, but rather diſeaſes and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, he changed his courſe of life, and followed the dictates of avarice, that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually offering to his eyes external happineſs ſeated on a throne of gold. His endeavours ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, and by the aſſiſtance of fortune he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the richeſt ſubject of the eaſt. Still ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was wanting. Power and honour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves to his view, and wholly engaged his attention. Theſe deſires did not remain long unſatisfied, for by the favour of the Sophy he was advanced to the higheſt dignities of the Perſian empire. But alas I he was ſtill never the nearer

to the primary object of his moſt ardent wiſhes, fears, doubts, and a thouſand different anxieties that attend the great, perpetually haunted him and made him ſeek again the calm retirement of a rural life; nor was the latter productive of any more comfort than the former ſtation. In ſhort, being diſappointed, and finding happineſs in no one condition, he ſought the hermit a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, to complain of his fate, and claim the promiſe he had received before the beginning of his adventures. Abudah ſeeing his diſciple return again after the ſtated time, ſtill diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, took him by the hand, and, ſmiling upon him with an air of gentle reproof, "Achmer, ſaid he, ceaſe to blame the fates for the uneaſineſs which ariſes alone from thy own breaſt; behold, ſince thou haſt performed the taſk I enjoined in order to make thee more capable of following my future inſtructions, I will unfold to thee the grand miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of wiſdom, by which ſhe leads her votaries to happineſs.

               <p>MR. Dyer, who was remarkable for face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs and drollery, happened one day to be alone at the Flaſk at Hampſtead, in a veniſon time, when the Cordwainers company kept their annual feaſt there. Dyer obſerved two glorious haunches roaſting at the fire, and made it his buſineſs to learn who they were for. Being told for the Cordwainers company, he determined to dine with them. He knew it was the cuſtom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe occaſions for every member to bring his friend, and conſequently that ſeveral, as well as himſelf, would be ſtrangers to all but one in the company; and that queſtions are never aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when once admittance is obtained and people are ſeated; he therefore watched his opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty when dinner went up, and ſeated himſelf among the reſt, as near as he could to one of the haunches, where he did not fail to play his part. He was very pleaſant and cheerful, and thoſe that ſat next him were highly diverted; no exceptions

After dinner when the bottle and ſong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to move briſkly round, he ſung in his turn, and was much applauded. But when the time came that he thought of departing, he ſhifted his ſeat, and placing himſelf next the door, he began a ſtory. He had already drawn the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the company upon him by his uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humour: ſo, upon the word ſtory, all were ſilent.

When I was a young fellow," continued Dyer, gravely, "I was but low in the world, myſelf; and I obſerved that the neareſt way to wealth was through the road of frugality; and therefore I pitched upon a chop-houſe, in Grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, where I could dine for two-pence. The miſtreſs of the houſe was remarkably neat and civil, particularly to thoſe who were her conſtant cuſtomers; and the room where we dined was, by means of a curtain, or more properly a blanket hung upon a rod, partitioned off into two divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the inner and the outer; the inner diviſion the good woman kept for the better ſort of folks, of which I had the honour to be accounted one,

and the outer was for the caſual and ordinary ſort. It happened one day, however, as I was drawing the blanket to go in as uſual, the miſtreſs of the houſe pulled me haſtily by the coat, and whiſpered in my ear, 'You muſt not go in there to-day, Sir,' 'Why ſo?' ſaid I in ſome heat. 'I beg your pardon, Sir,' ſaid the woman; 'but indeed you can't be admitted' What the devil's the matter, that I can't be admitted? ſaid I, ſwag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering. 'Why,' ſaid the woman, with joy in her countenance, 'the maſter and wardens of the Cordwainers company do me the honour to dine with me to-day, and I muſt keep my beſt parlour empty for their worſhips reception!' I thought it indeed but decent to give place to that worthy body, and ſo was pacified.' The compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon hearing this ſtory, began to lay their heads together, to know who this gentleman was, which Dyer obſerving, took that opportunity to ſlip away.</p>

               <p>SOON after the burning of the ſtately palace of Whitehall, one Holmes, a tradeſman, who lived in George-yard, the ſpot on which Great George ſtreet now ſtands, paſſing over the ruins ſtumbled on ſomething which, attracting his curioſity, he minutely obſerved, and diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to be a kind of diſtant reſemblance of a burſt, but as it was greatly effaced by the effects of the fire, he could draw no certain concluſion from it.</p>
               <p>However, he carried it home, and having ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered off the droſſy maſs which adhered to it, his wife ſcoured it, and placed it as an ornament upon an old cheſt of drawers. As Goody Holmes was particularly induſtrious in rubbing the buſt, whenever ſhe cleaned her furniture, it ſoon became ſo bright, that upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon it was found to be an exact like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the celebrated Cardinal Wolſey. One of Holmes' cuſtomers, by trade a founder, having been ſhewn the buſt, and conceiving it to be braſs, agreed to purchaſe it by the weight, and carried it home.</p>

               <p>VULGAR errors maintain their ground, becauſe men have not ſpirit enough to detect them.

               <p>Three ſharpers, having found means to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to a king, told him that they could weave a brocade of exquiſite workmanſhip, and of ſo rare a property, that it would be inviſible to any perſon who was either baſe-born, diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his wife or had been guilty of any villainy. The king, deſirous to poſſeſs ſo great a rarity, gave them a kind reception, and allotted them a palace to carry on the manufacture. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them with money, gold, ſilver, ſilk, and all other materials. They fixed up their looms, and reported that they were employed all day upon the web. After ſome time, one of them
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031735_0131_0FEE2A93F18C8648"/>
waited upon the king, and acquainted him that the work was begun, and that the brocade would be the moſt beautiful in the world, as his majeſty might be convinced, if he would condeſcend to come and ſee it alone. The king, to prove the reality of their pretenſions, inſtead of going him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſent his chamberlain, but without dropping any hint of the danger of an impoſition. The chamberlain went; but when the weavers told him the property of the brocade, he had not courage enough to ſay that he did not ſee it, but told the king that the work went on, and that the piece would be of unparalelled beauty The king ſent another nobleman, who, from the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, made the ſame report. After that he ſent many others, who all declared they had ſeen the piece. At length the king went himſelf, and upon his entrance, obſerved that all the weavers were diligently employed, and that their whole converſation turned upon the ſucceſs of their work; one ſaying, "Here is a noble foliage!" another, "What a grand deſign!" a third, "How beautiful is this colour!" But as he could ſee nothing all this time except the loom, and as he could not ſuſpect the report which had been brought him by ſo many courtiers without any variation, he was ſtruck to the heart, and began to doubt the legitimacy of his own birth How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he thought it moſt prudent to diſguiſe his
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031735_0132_0FEE2A9581947EC8"/>
ſentiments; and when he returned to court he began to expreſs himſelf highly pleaſed with the goodneſs and beauty of this maſter piece of art. At the end of three days, he ſent the ſteward of his houſhold, who, that he might not looſe his honour, praiſed the work even more extravagant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than the king had done. This redoubled the king's vexation; and he and all his courtiers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the utmoſt doubt and perplexity; no one daring to confeſs, that this famous piece was a non-entity to him. In this ſtate the affair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till upon occaſion of a great feſtival, ſome courtiers preſſed his majeſty to have a robe made of this ſilk in honour of the day. When the weavers came to the preſence chamber, and were acquainted with the king's purpoſe, they inſiſted that none could make up the brocade ſo well as themſelves, pretended they had brought it with them curiouſly wrapped up, and buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as if they were unfolding it. They alſo took meaſure of his majeſty, handled their ſciſſors, and practiſed all the motions of perſons buſy in cutting out. On the feſtival day they returned, pretended they had brought the robe, made as if they were trying it on, and at length told his majeſty that it fitted and adorned him beyond imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The king, credulous and confounded, walked down ſtairs, mounted his horſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the ſolemn cavalcade, in which he was to
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031735_0133_0FEE2A9A1161E3E0"/>
ſhew himſelf to his people; who having heard, that he who did not ſee the brocade muſt be a villain, a baſtard, or cuckold, unanimouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they ſaw it, and extolled the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of it. At length a Moor, who belonged to the king's ſtables, could not help crying out, "The king is in his ſhirt, the king is naked." The ice was now broke. The next perſon to him ſaid the ſame, and the confeſſion of not ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this imaginary brocade was ſoon made by ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery mouth; till at laſt the king himſelf, and all his courtiers, encouraged by the multitude, diveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves of their fears, and ventured to own the deception. Upon this, orders were giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to apprehend the ſharpers; but they had very wiſely taken care of themſelves, and made off with the money, gold, ſilver, ſilk, and other val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable materials, with which the king had ſupplied them.

According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly John, after providing an occaſional coachman, and being equipped by his maſter, with a volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

wig, and all the formal exterior of his new profeſſion, went with him to a patient, with whom the plan had been concerted the night before.—Being admitted, the Doctor, after the uſual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of feeling the gentleman's pulſe, and the like which was heedfully remarked by the candidate, deſired to know how many ſtools he had had, and what was the condition of them. Upon this a pan was brought to him of chantily porcelain, virgin ware out of the ſhop, when the Doctor gravely called for a ſpoon, and by way of taſting, eat two or three ſpoonfuls, aſſuring his patient that it was very laudable matter; and ſo in fact it was, being no other than an excellent marmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade of apricots prepared for carrying on the jeſt. John, whoſe ſtomach had turned at firſt, recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered a little at ſeeing his maſter eat ſo favourouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Doctor took his fee and they left the patient. The next day John was ſent alone, where after mimicking as near as he could what his maſter had done on the proceeding day, he came in courſe to the ſtate of the ſtools. The pan and ſpoon were then produced, and John, who had reſolved to act his part throughout, took a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and was properly affected both by the taſte and ſmell of the contents, being real, unadulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, fecal matter. This diſconcerted John's preſcription ſo much, that the patient pretending to be affronted, diſmiſſed him without the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031735_0136_0FEE2AA9BB348E20"/>
of a fee. John returned home cured of his ambition of being a Doctor; and requeſted as a great favour, to be reinſtated on his coach box.</p>

               <p>DURING the hard froſt, in the year 1740, four young gentlemen of conſiderable rank rode into an inn, near one of the principal ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues to the city of London, at eleven o'clock at night, without any attendant; and having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſome concern about their horſes, and overlooked the proviſion that was made for them, called for a room, ordering wine and tobacco to be brought in, and declaring, that as they were to ſet out very early in the morning, it was not worth while to go to bed. Before the waiter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, each of them had laid a pocket piſtol up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table, which when he entered they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſolicitous to conceal, and affected ſome confuſion at the ſurpriſe. They perceived with great ſatisfaction that the fellow was alarmed at his diſcovery; and having, upon various preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031735_0137_0FEE2AAB45FE7C20"/>
called him often into the room, one of them contrived to pull out a maſk with his handerchief, from the pocket of a horſeman's coat. They diſcourſed in dark and and ambiguous terms, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected a buſy and anxious circumſpection, urged the man often to drink, and ſeemed deſirous to render him ſubſervient to ſome purpoſe which they were unwilling to diſcover. They endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured to conciliate his good will by extravagant commendations of his dexterity and diligence, and encouraged him to familiarity by aſking him many queſtions. He was, however, ſtill cautious and reſerved; one of them therefore, pretending to have known his mother, put a crown into his hand, and ſoon after took an opportunity to aſk him at what hour the ſtage coach ſet out in the morning, whether it was full, and if it was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a guard.</p>
               <p>The waiter was now confirmed in his ſuſpic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions; and though he had accepted the bribe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to diſcover the ſecret. Having evaded the queſtions with as much art as he could, he went to his maſter, Mr. Spiggot, who was then in bed, and acquainted him with what he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
               <p>Mr. Spiggot immediately got up, and held a conſultation with his wife what was to be done. She adviſed him to ſend immediately for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, and ſecure them; but he conſidered, that
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031735_0138_0FEE2AACCD774400"/>
as this would probably prevent a robbery, it would deprive him of an opportunity to gain a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable ſum, which he would become entitled to upon their conviction, if he could apprehend them after the fact; he therefore very prudently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up four of his hoſtlers that belonged to the yard, and having communicated his ſuſpicions and deſign, engaged them to enliſt under his command, as an eſcort to the coach, and to watch the motions of the high waymen as he ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. But mine hoſt alſo wiſely conſidering that this expedition would be attended with certain expence, and that the profit which he expected was ſomewhat doubtful acquainted the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with their danger, and propoſed that a guard ſhould be hired by a voluntary contribution; a propoſal to which (upon a ſight of the robbers through the window) they readily agreed. Spiggot was now ſecured againſt pecuniary loſs, at all events. About three o'clock, the knights of the frolic, with infinite ſatisfaction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held five paſſengers, among whom there was but one gentleman, ſtep into the coach with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of criminals going to execution; and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſignificant ſigns which paſſed between them and the landlord, concerning the precautions tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for their defence</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the coach was gone, the ſuppoſed highwaymen paid their reckoning in great

haſte, and called for their horſes; care had already been taken to ſaddle them; for it was not Mr. Spiggot's deſire that the adventurers ſhould go far before they executed their purpoſe; and as ſoon as they departed he prepared to follow them with his poſſee. He was indeed greatly ſurprized to ſee them turn the contrary way when they went out of the inn yard; but he ſuppoſed they might chuſe to take a ſmall circle to prevent ſuſpicion, as they might eaſily overtake the coach whenever they would; he determined, however, to keep behind them; and therefore, inſtead of going af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the coach, followed them at a diſtance, till to his utter diſappointment, he ſaw them perſiſt in a different rout, and at length turn into an inn in Piccadily, where ſeveral ſervants in livery appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been waiting for them, and where his curioſity was ſoon gratified with their characters and names.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the coach proceeded on its journey. The panic of the paſſengers increaſed upon perceiving that the guard which they had hired did not come up; and they began to accuſe Spiggot, of having betrayed them to the robbers for a ſhare of the booty; they could not help looking every moment from the window, though it was ſo dark that a waggon could not have been ſeen at the diſtance of twenty yards; every tree was miſtaken for a man and horſe, the noiſe of

               <p>It happened that when the coach was got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two miles out of town, it was overtaken by a horſeman who rode very hard, and called out with great eagerneſs to the driver to ſtop.

               <p>IN 1702, Peter the Great, having made ſeveral ineffectual attempts on Noteborg, a Sweediſh fortreſs, now called Schluſſelburgh, ſent prince Galitzin, colonel of the guards, at the head of a ſelect corps, to take it by ſtorm.

               <head>HISTORY OF THE SIEGE AND SURRENDER OF CALAIS, IN THE YEAR 1347.</head>
               <p>AFTER the memorable battle of Creſſy, the victorious Edward the third, laid ſiege to Calais. He had fortified his camp in ſuch an impregnable manner, that all the efforts of the French to raiſe the ſiege or to throw ſuccours into the city, proved ineffectual. The citizens, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, animated by their gallant governor, John de Vienne, made an admirable defence; and the ſiege was protracted to the ſecond year, when the inhabitants were reduced by famine to the moſt deplorable extremities. In a deſperate ſally, the governor was taken priſoner; and the command then devolved upon Euſtace de St Pierre, the may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the city, a man of humble birth, but of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted virtue, who ſoon found himſelf under the neceſſity of capitulating, and offering to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render the city, with all the effects of the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, provided they were permitted to depart with life and liberty. As Edward had long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expected to aſcend the throne of France, he was exaſperated to the laſt degree againſt theſe people, whoſe valour had defeated his warmeſt hopes. He determined, therefore, to take an exemplary revenge, although he wiſhed to avoid
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031735_0145_0FEE2AD7AC9E4978"/>
the imputation of cruelty. He anſwered by Sir Walter Mauny, that they all deſerved capital puniſhment, as obſtinate traitors to him, their rightful ſovereign; that, however, in his wonted clemency, he conſented to pardon the inhabitants, provided they would deliver up to him ſix of their principal citizens with halters about their necks, as victims of due atonement for that ſpirit of rebellion with which they had inflamed the common people. All the remains of this deſolate city were convened in the great ſquare, anxiouſly expecting the ſentence of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. When Sir Walter had declared his meſſage, conſternation was impreſſed on every face; each looked upon death as his own inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table lot; for ſhould they deſire to be ſaved at the price propoſed? Whom had they to deliver up, ſave parents, brothers, kindred, or valiant neighbours, who had ſo often expoſed their lives in their defence? To a long and dead ſilence, deep ſighs and groans ſucceeded, till Euſtace de Saint Pierre, aſcending a little eminence, thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the aſſembly: "My friends and fellow-citizens, you ſee the condition, to which we muſt either ſubmit, to the terms of the cruel conqueror, or yield up our tender infants, our wives and daughters, to the brutal rage of the ſoldiery. We well know what the tyrant intends by his ſpecious offers of mercy. It does not ſatiate his
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031735_0146_0FEE2AD9353D6500"/>
vengeance to make us merely miſerable; he would alſo makes us merely criminal; he would make us contemptible; he will grant us life on no other condition, than that our being unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it. Look about you my friends, and ſix upon the perſons whom you wiſh to deliver up as the victims to your own ſafety. Which of theſe would you appoint to the rack, the ax, or the halter? Is there any here who has not watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for you, who has not bled for you? Is there any here, who has not ſuffered fatigues and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a thouſand times worſe than death, that you and yours might live to ſee days of peace and proſperity? Is it your preſervers, then, whom you would devote to deſtruction? You will not, you cannot do it. Juſtice, honour, humanity, make ſuch a treaſon impoſſible. Where then is our reſource? Is there any expedient left, by which we may avoid guilt and infamy on the one hand, or the horrors of a ſacked city on the other? There is, my friends, there is one expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient left; an excellent, a godlike expedient! Is there any here to whom virtue is dearer than life? Let him offer an oblation for the ſafety of the people! He ſhall not fail of a bleſſed appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation from that power, who offered up his only ſon for the ſalvation of mankind"</p>
               <p>He ſpoke; but an univerſal ſilence enſued. Each man looked around for the example of that
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:031735_0147_0FEE2ADAC0251430"/>
virtue and magnanimity in others, which all wiſhed to approve in themſelves, though they wanted the reſolution. At length St. Pierre reſumed:</p>
               <p>"I ſhould have deemed it diſhonorable, my fellow-citizens, to propoſe to others that ſacrifice, to which I could not ſubmit myſelf But I thought it ungenerous to deprive any man of that honourable renown, which might attend a firſt offer of ſo ſignal an occaſion; for I doubt not that there are many here who are as zealous for this martyrdom as I can be, however modeſty, and the fear of imputed oſtentation, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from being foremoſt in the offer. Indeed, the ſtation, to which the captivity of the governor has unhappily raiſed me, imports a right of being the firſt in giving myſelf for your ſakes. I give it then freely, I give it cheerfully. Who comes next?—Your ſon! exclaimed a youth. "Ah, my child!" cried St. Pierre, I am then twice ſacrificed. But no, I have rather begotten thee a ſecond time. Thy years are few, but full, my ſon. The victim of virtue has reached the goal of honour. Who next, my friends? This is the hour of heroes."—"Your kinſman," cried John de Aire!—"Your kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man," cried James Wiſſant!—"Your kinſman," cried Peter Wiſſant!—"Ah, exclaimed Sir Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mauny, burſting into tears, Why was I not a citizen of Calais?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="unknown:031735_0148_0FEE2ADC47AD02F8"/>
The ſixth victim was ſtill wanting, but was quickly ſupplied, by lot, from numbers who were now emulous of ſo ennobling an example.</p>
               <p>The keys of the city were delivered to Sir Walter. He ordered the gates to be opened, and gave charge to his attendants to conduct the remaining citizens, with their families, through the camp of the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>Before they departed, however, they deſired permiſſion to take their laſt adieu of their deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erers. What a parting! What a ſcene!" They crowded with their wives and children about St. Pierre, and his fellow-priſoners. They embraced, they clung around, they fell proſtrate before them. They groaned; they wept aloud. At length St. Pierre and his fellow victims, appeared under the conduct of Sir Walter and his guard. All the tents of the Engliſh were inſtantly emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied. The ſoldiers arranged themſelves on each ſide, to behold, to contemplate, to admire this little band of patriots as they paſſed. They mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured their applauſe of that virtue which they could but revere even in enemies; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded thoſe ropes which they had voluntarily aſſumed about their necks as enſigns of greater dignity than that of the Britiſh garter.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as they had reached the royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, "Mauny," ſaid the King, "Are theſe the principal inhabitants of Calais?" "They are,"
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031735_0149_0FEE2AEA7541AEA8"/>
ſaid Mauny; "they are not only the principal men of Calais; they are the principal men of France, my lord, if virtue has any ſhare in the act of ennobling."—"Were they delivered peaceably? ſaid Edward, "Was there no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, no commotion among the people?"—Not in the leaſt my Lord. They are ſelf-deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, ſelf-devoted, and come to offer their ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable lives, as an ample equivalent for the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of thouſands."</p>
               <p>The King, who was highly incenſed at the length of the ſiege, ordered them to be carried away to immediate execution; nor could all the intreaties of his courtiers divert him from his cruel purpoſe. But what neither a regard to his own character, nor the feelings of humanity could effect, was happily accompliſhed by the more powerful influence of conjugal affection. The Queen who was then pregnant, being informed of the particulars reſpecting the ſix victims, flew into her huſband's preſence, threw herſelf on her knees before him, and, with tears in her eyes, beſought him not to ſtain his character with an indelible mark of infamy, by committing ſuch a barbarous deed. Edward could refuſe nothing to a wife whom he ſo tenderly loved; and the Queen, not ſatisfied with having ſaved the lives of the ſix burghers, conducted them to her tent, where ſhe applauded their virtue, regaled them
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:031735_0150_0FEE2AEC093F5AF8"/>
with a plentiful repaſt, and having made them a preſent of money and cloathes, ſent them back to their fellow-citizens.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031735_0153_0FEE2AFBCFD3BE18"/>
down bleſſings upon your houſe; I am ſure God will reward your goodneſs."—"Pray to God my good friend." replied the peaſant, "pray to God Almighty, that ſhe may have a ſafe delivery; that is all I wiſh for.—And is that all you wiſh to make you happy?—"Happy! judge for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—I have five fine children; a dear wife that loves me; a father and mother both in good health; and my labour is fully ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them all."—"Do your father and mother live with you?"—"Certainly, they are in the next room with my wife." "But your cottage here is very ſmall!"—"It is large enough to hold us all."—The good peaſant went to his wife, who in an hour was happily delivered. Her huſband in a tranſport of joy, brought the child to the Czar: "Look," ſaid he, look, this is the ſixth ſhe has brought me! What a fine hearty child he is! May God preſerve him as he has done my others!" The Czar, ſenſibly affected by this ſcene, took the infant in his arms; "I know," ſaid he, from the phyſiognomy of this child, that he will be quite fortunate; he will arrive, I am certain, at great preferment."—The peaſant ſmiled at this prediction, and that inſtant the two eldeſt girls came to kiſs their new-born brother, and their grand mother came alſo to take him back. The little ones followed her; and the peaſant, laying himſelf down upon his bed of ſtraw, invited the
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031735_0154_0FEE2AFD56D88E78"/>
ſtranger to do the ſame. In a moment the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant was in a ſound and peaceful ſleep; but the Czar, ſitting up, looked around and contemplated every thing with an eye of tenderneſs and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—the ſleeping children and their ſleeping father. An undiſturbed ſilence reigned in the cottage.—"What a happy calm! What delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tranquility!" ſaid the Emperor, "Avarice and ambition, ſuſpicion and remorſe never enter here. How ſweet is the ſleep of innocence!"—In ſuch reflections, and on ſuch a bed, did the mighty Emperor of all the Ruffias ſpend the night! The peaſant awoke at break of day, and his gueſt tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leave of him, ſaid, "I muſt return to Moſcow, my friend: I am acquainted there with a very benevolent man, to whom I ſhall take care to mention your kind treatment of me. I can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon him to ſtand god-father to your child. Promiſe me, therefore, that you will wait for me, that I may be preſent at the chriſtening; I will be back in three hours at fartheſt."—The pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand did not think much of this mighty promiſe; but in the good nature of his heart, he conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however, to the ſtranger's requeſt.</p>
               <p>The Czar immediately took his leave—the three hours were ſoon gone, and nobody appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The peaſant therefore followed by his fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, prepared to carry his child to church; but as he was leaving his cottage, he heard on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031735_0155_0FEE2AFEDDB20D00"/>
the trampling of horſes, and rattling of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny coaches. He looked out and preſently ſaw a multitude of horſes, and a train of ſplendid car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. He knew the Imperial guards, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly called his family to come and ſee the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror go by. They all run out in a hurry, and ſtand before the door. The horſemen and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages ſoon formed a circular line; and at laſt, the ſtate coach of the Czar ſtopped, oppoſite the peaſant's door. The guards kept back the crowd, which the hopes of ſeeing their ſovereign had collected together. The coach door was opened: The Czar alighted, and advancing to his hoſt, thus addreſſed him: "I promiſed you a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father; I am come to fulfil my promiſe; give me your child, and follow me to the church"—The peaſant ſtood like a ſtatue; now looking at the Emperor with mingled emotions of aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment and joy; now obſerving his magnificent robes, and the coſtly jewels with which they were adorned; and now turning to a crowd of nobles that ſurrounded him. In this profuſion of pomp he could not diſcover the poor ſtranger, who had laid all night with him upon ſtraw. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror for ſome moments ſilently enjoyed his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and then addreſſed him thus: "Yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day <hi>you</hi> performed the duties of humanity; to day, <hi>I</hi> am come to diſcharge the moſt delightful duty of a ſovereign, that of recompenſing virtue.

You ſhall have numerous flocks, rich paſtures, and a houſe that will enable you to exerciſe the duties of hoſpitality with pleaſure. Your new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born child ſhall be my ward; for you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member," continued the Emperor, ſmiling, "that I propheſied he would be fortunate."—The good peaſant could not ſpeak; but with tears of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſibility in his eyes, he ran inſtantly to fetch the child, brought him to the Emperor, and laid him reſpectfully at his feet. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſovereign was quite affected; he took the child in his arms and carried him himſelf to the church; and after the ceremony was over, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to deprive him of his mother's milk, he took him to his cottage, and ordered that he ſhould be ſent to him, as ſoon as he could be weaned.—The Czar faithfully obſerved his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, cauſed the boy to be educated in his palace, provided amply for his future ſettlement in life, and continued ever after to heap favours upon the virtuous peaſant and his family.</p>

               <p>GREECE and the Eaſt, at their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors feet, enjoyed the calm of profound peace. Alexander ſeemingly contented amidſt this tranquility of the world, devoted unreſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly his heart to his appetites for pleaſure Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets and all the ſports of feſtive joy within the walls of Ecbatana, filled up his time; varied his delights. Statira, Thais, and Roxana, by turns, ſhared and accumulated his deſires. But from the banks of the Hydaſpes, a more charming object introduced at his court, was ſoon likely to fix his love. Alexander at firſt ſight was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to Campaſpa; and what other beauty, could deſerve his complaiſance and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? The hand of nature, and the work of art, had never formed ſo perfect a model. So ſoon as with admiring eyes he had ſurveyed her over, he ordered Apelles to be ſent for: "From thy art I require a new maſter-piece; of mortals, ſaid he, "come and paint the moſt beautiful—ſhe is a ſubject worthy thy pencil; go and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thy colours and canvaſs; from her bed I will have her conducted before us, that thy eyes may ſee her without garb and without veil: all
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:031735_0162_0FEE2B2498D5ECE8"/>
her features are charming, thou muſt paint them all—but I fear for thy heart the power of her charms"—"Ah! my good lord, baniſh thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions; heretofore enamoured of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ſlave, I juſt touched the moment, replied Apelles, of beginning to deem myſelf happy. The fierce Scythian having extended his arms beyond the banks of the Hydaſpes, ſevered us, and it may be for ever: but nothing for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can deface her from my heart, nor keep my tears from flowing."</p>
               <p>He ſpoke, departed, and returned. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient luſtre of the ſun illum'd the ſaloon where Campaſpa, bluſhing like the morn, had entered; and the ſparkling ſplendor of its azure canopy ſeemed to invite forward every eye to the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. "Contemplate," ſaid the King, "what I preſent to thy ſight, admire, paint, and do not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>With downcaſt eyes, Campaſpa naked, bluſhes again, turns aſide her head, nor dares ſhe ſtep forward. On her boſom ſhe holds one hand ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and the other ſtealing down, covers other charms. "Ah! what ſee I?" cried Apelles, "Ye gods! I am not miſtaken, it is herſelf"—His languiſhing looks wander long about her; run from his rival to conſult his eyes: he ſees pleaſure in them; he trembles; he ſighs. Tranſports of the moſt tender love, joy, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031735_0163_0FEE2B261D9BD198"/>
agitate him by turns. He groans, he adores, he deteſts, he deſires. She, raiſing her eyes, knows her lover, fetches a cry, ſighs, retires, looks fondly on Apelles, ſees her danger, and diſſembles. Theſe ſighs of an inflamed heart, theſe cries are heard. Apelles perceived that he is loved. "Ah!" ſaid he, then is my rival even in the lap of pleaſure, leſs happy than I am, being leſs beloved."</p>
               <p>Campaſpa, placed oppoſite Appelles, would fain ſhew herſelf to the eyes only of her lover; but Alexander is near her, and wants to ſee her every moment in a new attitude. On the moſt ſecret charms he often glances an uneaſy eye. But the canvaſs is ſtretched out, the pencils are ready, and in ſpite of his inward regret, the painter has began to ſtrike the outlines of the features.</p>
               <p>"To my misfortune," ſays he, "I likewiſe add myſelf; I am going to prepare pleaſures <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Alexander ſtanding cloſe by her with wiſtful eyes, is ſcarce able to command over the irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſenſes: he impreſſes kiſſes on a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and beauties which Campaſpa, trembling would be glad, yet dares not to defend. She, however, in the ſilence of her heart, invokes all the gods againſt any further attempt of an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maſter, caſting at the ſame time on her lover the moſt tender of looks, but ſeeing him grow pale and turn from her his eyes, ſouth with like a dart ſhe flies into his arms.—Both bathed in tears, fall at the king's feet: "This is that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſlave, to whom, on the confines of India, I pledged my troth. Not one word more did Apelles ſpeak to his rival. Campaſpa would fain ſpeak; fear and ſobs ſhut up the paſſage of her enfeebled voice. With faces bent towards the hero's feet, by tremulous hands they embrace his knees; in his eyes they read his jealous rage; in their blood, perhaps, it will be allayed. They fill up with love thoſe moments of terror, and beſtow at leaſt on each other the remainder of life; they ſtretch to one another the arms which fear has frozen, and at length become cloſed in a mutual embrace.</p>
               <p>Alexander, now long a motionleſs ſpectator, ſuffers his looks to dwell upon them; he ſeems to meditate on the diſtreſſed ſituation, and to reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>train his reſentment from breaking out. But his

By robbing thee of her, O Appelles! my enjoyment would be dull; the image of thy tears would follow me into her arms; and Campaſpa in mine, would bewail the man ſhe loves."</p>

               <head>RICCIARDO AND CATHARINA.</head>
               <p>CATHARINA, according to Boccaſe, was a beautiful young lady; the hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of her aged parents, and as good as ſhe was handſome. Ricciardo was a cavalier of honor on the other hand, and had a fair reputation with the father and mother of this lady, that he was as free in the houſe with them as a child of the family. They were both well deſcended, and by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of viſits and interviews, had contracted ſuch an agreement of inclinations and manners, that they thought they could not place their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections better than mutually one upon the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. It was very rarely that they could get a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate word together, and their time was ſo ſhort too, that their talk was rather hint, than diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Such an occaſion preſenting itſelf to Ricciardo Well,! Madam, ſays he, in a ſoft whiſper, as he paſſed by her; I am dead if you do not love me; And that is my caſe too, ſays ſhe in the ſame way of myſtery; But how ſhall we meet? Do you but get leave, ſays he, to lodge in the garden gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, and let me alone for the reſt. And there the dialogue broke off.</p>
               <p>Catharina took occaſion next day to tell her mother that her chamber did not agree with her;
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031735_0167_0FEE2B38D4DD1468"/>
ſhe was hot in it and out of order, for want of reſt. Now the gallery chamber, ſhe ſaid was open and airy, and the very chirping of the birds would be ſome ſort of relief to her, when ſhe could not ſleep. They reaſoned the matter a while, till her mother promiſed to move her fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er about it, and ſo ſhe did, but the old man was ſo froward and croſs grained, that there was no enduring him. Here is a ſtir indeed with a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtical fop, ſays he, as if the girl could not ſleep without a fiddle.</p>
               <p>The peeviſhneſs of this reply kept Carharina waking the next night, in good earneſt; and ſhe fell ſo ill upon it, that the mother preſſed her huſband yet once more about it, Why what are you doing, my dear, ſays ſhe? We have but one poor child in the world, you ſee, and that is to be caſt away it ſeems. What is it to us, I prithee, whether the girl lies in one chamber or in another? At this rate ſhe lay teaſing of him, till at laſt, all in a fret, Well! ſays he, young laſſes are like watermen, they look one way and row another.—But if nothing elſe will ſerve, let but me have the locking of her up a nights, and letting her out again next morning, and you may e'en lodge her where you have a mind to.</p>
               <p>Ricciardo, underſtanding that his miſtreſs had gained her point, mounted the garden wall that night, and ſo got up to the chamber window,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:031735_0168_0FEE2B3A73FD0948"/>
where he poſted himſelf upon duty till towards break of day, and then drew off again. This went forward, night after night, till at length having quite over watched themſelves they fell faſt aſleep, hand in hand, at the window.</p>
               <p>While they were in this poſture, in comes the maſter of the houſe, before any of the family were ſtirring, with the tidings to his wife, that his daughter had turned bird catcher, and had caught a Nightengale, prithee ſays he, come along with me now, and tell me if the girl was not much in the right to take the gallery chamber for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſleeping room. This put the mother into ſuch a freak, that the whole town would have rung of the ſtory, if her huſband had not given a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtop to it. Come, come ſays the old man, ſome wiſer than ſome. In ſuch a caſe as this, the leſs noiſe the better. Here is an innocent love carried on, without either fraud or diſhonour; the attempt indeed is capital to the poor fellow, but by my faith, I ſhould be loth to take the forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure I ſee no exception at all to the young man ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in matter of years, blood or fortune; and for the reſt, what have we more to do, than to call a prieſt immediately, and make a match of it.

It is known that the Pſylli of Cyrene have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain empire over ſerpents, and it is generally believed that the Tentyrites have the ſame power over Crocodiles. In fact, they dive and ſwim boldly in the middle of the Nile, without any injury. In the ſpectacles given at Rome, ſeveral crocodiles were put into a baſon.

expoſing them to the Roman people, they took hold of them intrepidly, and carried them back into the baſon."</p>
               <p>This fact, atteſted by a judicious hiſtorian an ocular witneſs of it, cannot be called in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In our days, do not the Caribs, armed, only with a knife, fight advantageouſly with the ſhark, one of the moſt dreadful monſters of the ſea? Determined men are ſtill to be found in Egypt, who dare to attack the crocodile. They ſwim towards that formidable animal, and when he opens his mouth to ſwallow, thruſts into it a plank of fir, to which a cord is faſtened. The crocodile, by violently ſhutting his jaws, buries his ſharp teeth into it ſo far that he cannot diſengage them. The Egyptian holding the cord with one hand, then regains the banks of the river, and ſeveral men draw the monſter on ſhore, and kill him. This attack is not without danger; for if the ſwimmer is not ſkilful, he is immediately devoured. I never was myſelf a witneſs to this tranſaction, but many perſons at Grand Cairo have aſſured me it was true.</p>

               <p>AT an annual hunt held at the Lion in the town of S—y, where all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſons of Nimrod attend, to tire horſes, kill foxes and drink bumpers, was a certain co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alition 'ſquire, remarkable for having an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kennel of fox-hounds, a very fine ſtud of horſes, and a very conſiderable fortune; but more remarkable for being married to a moſt beautiful and accompliſhed woman, who, <hi>he had thought himſelf</hi> extremely fond of, during the time of his courtſhip; but, <hi>married,</hi> was too much of a ſportſman to regard the game, the chace being ended. Yet, tired as he was of his lady, he was not tired with the ſex. He had long looked with the eye of affection at the chambermaid of the inn. He had made her many offers, for the girl was really pretty; but his offers had been always rejected—for, wonderful as it may ſeem, ſhe was virtuous. This night he was determined ſhould crown his wiſhes; and deeming all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, like patriots, had their price, he gave her twenty guineas on condition of being made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. Tempted with the gold, ſhe appointed to meet him in the fartheſt room in the gallery as the clock ſtruck twelve, but prohibited his bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

The aunt of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, having died the day before, was quietly lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in her bed room till the feaſt was over, and, grief giving way to intereſt, the circumſtance was carefully concealed, leſt it might diminiſh the number of gueſts. Supper was ſcarcely over, before the lover, punctual to the moment, ſtole to the chamber, ſilently and in the dark; but when he found ſo cold a companion, retired with precipitation, and made but one ſtep from the top of the ſtairs to the bottom. His friends, alarmed at the noiſe, came round the unfortunate hero, who, having loſt all ſenſe and motion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have taken his laſt leap.

               <p>THE worſhipful Simon Simple, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> one of his majeſty's juſtices of the peace for the county of Kent, being one day at dinner with much oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er company, at the houſe of a neighbouring gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; after dinner, their kind hoſt, imagining that they had not eaten heartily enough, demanded if any of the company would eat a ſlice of cold neat's tongue; but being anſwered in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by every perſon preſent, "Come, come," cries he, "perhaps you only ſay ſo, becauſe it is not here; fetch the tongue, Thomas, and bring a ſlice of butter with it,"—The Servant obeys, but coming into the room, his foot ſlipped, and the tongue falling from the diſh, come rolling in before him.

On which the Servant replies, "You know, Sir, it was only <hi>lapſus linguae,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no error of the mind." This reply not only produced his pardon, but ſet the company in a roar of the loudeſt applauſe. Mr. Simple, before-mentioned, laughed as loud and as long as the beſt of them; though being quite ignorant that <hi>lapſus linguae,</hi> was latin for <hi>a ſlip of the tongue,</hi> the could by no means gueſs where the cream of

He therefore orders a ſhoulder of mutton to be roaſted, and ſet by, till it was cold; and inviting a number of gentlemen to dine with him on the following day, he employed all the intervening time in inſtructing his ſervant how to throw down the mutton, and make the Latin apology—which he conceived would produce excellent ſport.—His company came at the time appointed, and having dined, our worſhipful juſtice cries—"I am afraid, gentlemen, you have made but an indifferent dinner, will you eat a ſlice of cold mutton?—Being anſwered in the negative, he ſays, "Come, I know you only ſay ſo, becauſe it is not here; Robert fetch the mutton, and be ſure you bring a ſlice of butter with it." Robert obeys his orders, and blundering in at the door, let fall the mutton; on which the juſtice began to ſcold at him, and Robert (as before inſtructed) excuſes himſelf by ſaying, "It was only <hi>ſlapſum ſlingum,</hi> and therefore no terror of the mind."

               <head>MODESTY AND ASSURANCE. A FABLE.</head>
               <p>MODESTY, the daughter of Knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, and Aſſurance, the offſpring of ignorance, met accidentally upon the road; and as both had a long way to go, and had experienced from former hardſhips, that they were alike unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to purſue their journey alone, they agreed, notwithſtanding the oppoſition in their nature, to lay aſide animoſities, and, for their mutual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to travel together. It was in a country where there were no inns for entertainment; ſo that to their own addreſs, and to the hoſpitality of the inhabitants, they were continually to be obliged for proviſion and lodging.</p>
               <p>Aſſurance had never failed getting admittance to the houſes of the great; but it had frequently
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:031735_0176_0FEE2B65AECA4198"/>
been her misfortune to be turned out of doors, at a time when ſhe was promiſing herſelf an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant entertainment, or a bed of down to reſt upon. Modeſty had been excluded from all ſuch houſes, and compelled to take ſhelter in the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the poor, where, though ſhe had leave to continue as long as ſhe pleaſed, a truſs of ſtraw had been her uſual bed, and roots, or the coarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proviſion, her conſtant repaſt. But as both, by this accidental meeting, were become friends and fellow travellers, they entertained hopes of aſſiſting each other, and of ſhortening the way, by dividing the cares of it.</p>
               <p>Aſſurance who dreſſed lightly, and who had ſomething commanding in her voice and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, found the ſame eaſy acceſs as before to the caſtles and palaces upon the way; while Modeſty, who followed, ſpeaking low, and caſting her eyes upon the ground, was, as uſual, puſhed back by the porter at the gate, till introduced by her companion, whoſe faſhionable appearance and familiar addreſs got admiſſion for both.</p>
               <p>And now, by the endeavour of each to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the other, their difficulties vaniſhed, and they ſaw themſelves the favourites of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, and the parties of their pleaſures, feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals and amuſements. The ſallies of aſſurance were continually checked by the delicacy of Modeſty; and the bluſhes of Modeſty were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031735_0177_0FEE267F97464C38"/>
relieved by the vivacity of Aſſurance, who, though ſhe was ſometimes detected at her old pranks, which always put her companion out of countenance, was yet ſo awed by her preſence, as to ſtop ſhort of offence.</p>
               <p>Thus in the company of Modeſty, Aſſurance gained that reception and eſteem which ſhe had vainly hoped for in her abſence, while Modeſty, by means of her new acquaintance, kept the beſt company, feaſted upon delicacies, and ſlept in the chambers of ſtate. Aſſurance, indeed, had in one particular, the aſcendency over her compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; for, if any one aſked Modeſty, whoſe daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe was, ſhe bluſhed, and made no anſwer, while Aſſurance took the advantage of her ſilence, and impoſed herſelf on the world as the offſpring of knowledge.</p>
               <p>In this manner did the travellers purſue their journey; Aſſurance taking the lead through the great towns and cities, and apologizing for the ruſticity of her companion; while Modeſty went foremoſt through the villages and hamlets, and excuſed the odd behaviour of Aſſurance, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting her as a courtier.</p>
               <p>It happened one day, after having meaſured a tedious length of road, that they came to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row river, which by a haſty ſwell had waſhed away the bridge built over it. As they ſtood upon the bank, caſting their eyes upon the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:031735_0178_0FEE2B67365BF848"/>
ſhore, they ſaw at a little diſtance, a magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent caſtle, and a crowd of people inviting them to come over. Aſſurance, who ſtopt at nothing throwing aſide the covering from her limbs, plunged almoſt naked into the ſtream, and ſwam ſafely to the other ſide. Modeſty offended at the indecency of her companion, and diffident of her own ſtrength, would have declined the danger; but being urged by Aſſurance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided for her cowardice by the people on the other ſide, ſhe unfortunately ventured beyond her depth, and oppreſſed by her fears, as well as entangled by her cloaths, which were bound tightly about her, immediately diſappeared, and was driven by the current no one knows whither. It is ſaid, indeed, that ſhe was afterwards taken up alive by a fiſherman on the Engliſh coaſt, and that ſhortly ſhe will be carried to the metropolis, and ſhewn to the curious of both ſexes.</p>
               <p>Aſſurance, not in the leaſt daunted, purſued her journey alone; and though not altogether as ſucceſsfully as with her companion; yet having learned in particular companies, and upon parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſions, to aſſume the air and manner of Modeſty, ſhe was received kindly at every houſe; and, at laſt, arriving at the end of her travels, ſhe became a very great lady, and roſe to be the firſt maid of honour to the queen of the country.</p>

               <p>THE Count de Peltzer, an officer in the Pruſſian ſervice, was the only ſon of a widow near ſixty years old. He was handſome, brave to an exceſs, and deeply in love with mademoiſelle de Benſkow. She was in her eighteenth year, gentle, pretty, and born with an extreme ſenſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. Her lover juſt turned of twenty, was loved with a paſſion equal to his own, and the day was fixed to make them happy. It was the 20th of June, 1778.</p>
               <p>The Pruſſian troops are always ready to take the field; and the 19th of June, at ten o'clock at night, the count's regiment received orders to march at midnight for Sileſia He was at Berlin and his miſtreſs at a country houſe four leagues from the town He ſet off conſequently without ſeeing her; and he wrote to her from the firſt place where he ſtopped, that it was impoſſible for him to live without her, that it was eſſential to his happineſs that ſhe ſhould follow him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and that they ſhould be married in Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. He wrote at the ſame time to her brother, who was his moſt intimate friend, to plead his cauſe with her parents. She ſet out accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by this brother, and by her lover's mother.

Never did the ſands of Brandenburg appear ſo heavy as to this charming girl; but at length the journey ended, and ſhe arrived at the town of Horſtadt:—It was in the morning, and "nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er" ſaid her brother to me, "did my eyes ſee a woman lovelier than my ſiſter. The exerciſe of her journey had added to her bloom, and her eyes painted what paſſed in her heart." But, O human proſpects! how deceitful are you? How near is the moment of wretchedneſs to the moment of felicity? The carriage is ſtopped to let paſs ſome ſoldiers, who advancing by ſlowſteps, bore in their arms a wounded officer. The tender heart of the young lady was affected at the ſight: ſhe little expected that it was her lover. Some Auſtrians had approached this town, and the young count went out to repulſe them. Burning to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh himſelf, he ruſhed with ardour before his troop, and fell the victim of his unhappy impet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſity.</p>
               <p>To deſcribe the ſituation of this unfortunate, young woman, would be to inſult at once your heart and your imagination. Her lover is placed in his bed; his mother is at his feet, and his miſtreſs holds his hand.

She came;—he graſped her arm; and after two painful efforts to ſpeak, he ſays with a ſob, "Live my Charlotte, to comfort my mother,"—and expired.—When I paſſed through Berlin, in July 1779, the unfortunate lady had not recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered her ſenſes.</p>

               <p>ATHENS, long after the decline of the Roman empire, ſtill continued the ſeat of learning, politeneſs, and wiſdom. Theodore, the Oſtrogoth, repaired the ſchools which barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity was ſuffering to fall into decay, and continued thoſe penſions to men of learning, which avaricious governors had monopolized. In this city, and about this period, Alcander and Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius were fellow-ſtudents together. The one, the moſt ſubtle reaſoner of all the Lyceum; the other, the moſt eloquent ſpeaker in the academic grove. Mutual admiration ſoon begot a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Their fortunes were nearly equal, and they were natives of the two moſt celebrated cities in the world: for Alcander was at Athens, Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timius came from Rome.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate of harmony they lived for ſome time together, when Alcander, after paſſing the firſt part of his youth in the indolence of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, thought at length of entering into the buſy world; and, as a ſtep previous to this, placed his affections on Hypatia, a lady of exquiſite beauty. The day of their intended nuptials was fixed; the previous ceremonies were performed; and noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:031735_0184_0FEE251BA94D7C80"/>
now remained but her being conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triumph to the apartment of the bridegroom.</p>
               <p>Alcander's exultation in his own happineſs, or being unable to enjoy any ſatisfaction without making his friend Septimius a partner, prevailed upon him to introduce Hypatia to his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtudent; which he did with all the gaiety of a man who found himſelf equally happy in friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and love. But this was an interview fatal to the future peace of both; for Septimius no ſooner ſaw her, but he was ſmitten with an invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untary paſſion; and, though he uſed every effort to ſuppreſs deſires at once ſo imprudent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, the emotions of his mind in a ſhort time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo ſtrong, that they brought on a fever, which the phyſician judged incurable.</p>
               <p>During this illneſs, Alcander watched him with all the anxiety of fondneſs, and brought his miſtreſs to join in thoſe amiable offices of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. The ſagacity of the phyſicians, by theſe means, ſoon diſcovered the cauſe of their patient's diſorder was love; and Alcander being apprized of their diſcovery, at length extorted a confeſſion from the reluctant dying lover.</p>
               <p>It would but delay the narrative to deſcribe the conflict between love and friendſhip in the breaſt of Alcander; the Athenians were at that time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at ſuch refinement in morals, that every vir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue was carried to exceſs.

own felicity, he gave up his intended bride, in all her charms, to the young Roman. They were married privately by his connivance, and this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for change of fortune wrought as unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a change in the conſtitution of the now happy Septimius. In a few days he was perfectly recovered, and ſet out with his fair partner for Rome. Here, by an exertion of thoſe talents which he was ſo eminently poſſeſſed of, Septimius, in a few years, arrived at the higheſt dignities of the ſtate, and was conſtituted the city-judge, or praetor.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Alcander not only felt the pain of being ſeparated from his friend and his miſtreſs, but a proſecution was alſo commenced againſt him by the relations of Hypatia, for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baſely given up his bride, as was ſuggeſted, for money. His innocence of the crime laid to his charge, and even his eloquence in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, were not able to withſtand the influence of a powerful party.

However, being unable to raiſe ſo large a ſum at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his poſſeſſions were confiſcated, he himſelf was ſtripped of the habit of freedom, expoſed as a ſlave in the market-place, and ſold to the higheſt bidder.</p>
               <p>A merchant of Thrace becoming his purchaſer, Alcander, with ſome other companions of diſtreſs,

was carried into that region of deſolation and ſterility. His ſtated employment was to follow the herds of an imperious maſter, and his ſucceſs in hunting was all that was allowed him to ſupply his precarious ſubſiſtence. Every morning waked him to a renewal of famine or toil, and every change of ſeaſon ſerved but to aggravate his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheltered diſtreſs. After ſome years of bondage, however, an opportunity of eſcaping offered; he embraced it with ardour; ſo that travelling by night, and lodging in taverns by day, to ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en a long ſtory, he at laſt arrived at Rome. The ſame day on which Alcander arrived, Septimius ſat adminiſtering juſtice in the fortun, whither our wanderer came, expecting to be inſtantly known, and publicly acknowledged, by his former friend. Here he ſtood the whole day, among the croud, watching the eyes of the judge, and expecting to be taken notice of, but he was ſo much altered by a long ſucceſſion of hardſhips, that he contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued unnoticed among the reſt; and, in the evening, when he was going up to the praetor's chair, he was brutally repulſed by the attending lictors. The attention of the poor is generally driven from one ungrateful object to another; for night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on he found himſelf under a neceſſity of ſeeking a place to lie in, and yet he knew not where to apply. All emaciated, and in rags as he was, none of the citizens would harbour ſo much

wretchedneſs; and ſleeping in the ſtreets might be attended with interruption or danger: in ſhort, he was obliged to take up his lodging in one of the tombs without the city, the uſual retreat of guilt, poverty, and deſpair. In this manſion of horror, laying his head upon an inverted urn, he forgot his miſeries a while in ſleep; and found on his flinty couch, more caſe than beds of down can ſupply to the guilty.</p>
               <p>As he continued here, about midnight, two robbers came to make this their retreat; but happening to diſagree about the diviſion of their plunder, one of them ſtabbed the other to the heart, and left him weltering in blood at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. In theſe circumſtances he was found next morning dead at the mouth of the vault. This naturally inducing a further enquiry, an alarm was ſpread; the cave was examined; and Alcander was apprehended and accuſed of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and murder. The circumſtances againſt him were ſtrong, and the wretchedneſs of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance confirmed ſuſpicion. Misfortune and he were now ſo long acquainted, that he at laſt became regardleſs of life. He deteſted a world where he had found only ingratitude, falſhood, and cruelty; he was determined to make no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and thus lowering with reſolution, he was dragged, bound with cords, before the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Septimius. As the proofs were poſitive
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:031735_0188_0FEE2529E4AB40B8"/>
againſt him, and he offered nothing in his own vindication, the judge was proceeding to doom him to a moſt cruel and ignominious death, when the attention of the multitude was ſoon divided by another object. The robber who had been really guilty, was apprehended ſelling his plunder, and ſtruck with a panic, had confeſſed his crime. He was brought bound to the ſame tribunal, and acquitted every other perſon of any partnerſhip in his guilt. Alcander's innocence therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, but the ſullen raſhneſs of his conduct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a wonder to the ſurrounding multitude; but their aſtoniſhment was ſtill further encreaſed when they ſaw their judge ſtart from their tribunal to embrace the ſuppoſed criminal: Septimius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected his friend and former benefactor, and hung upon his neck with tears of pity and joy. Need the ſequel be related? Alcander was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted; ſhared the friendſhip and honours of the principal citizens of Rome; lived afterwards in happineſs and eaſe; and left it to be engraved on his tomb, That no circumſtances are ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, which Providence may not relieve.</p>

               <head>THE ADVENTURES OF PEDRO AND CELESTINA, A TALE.</head>
               <byline>By the Chevalier de FLORIAN. </byline>
               <p>CELESTINA, at ſeventeen, was the moſt admired beauty in Grenada. She was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan and heireſs to an immenſe fortune, under the guardianſhip of an old and avaricious uncle, whoſe name was Alonzo, and who paſſed his days in counting ducats, and his nights in ſilenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerenades nocturnally addreſſed to Coleſtina. His deſign was to marry her for the ſake of her great fortune, to his ſon, Henriquez, who had ſtudied ten years in the univerſity of Salamanca, and was now able to explain Cornelius Nepo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> tolerably well.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all the cavaliers of Grenada were in love with Celeſtina. As they could only obtain a ſight of her at maſs, the church ſhe frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was filled with great numbers of the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt and moſt accompliſhed youths of the country.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt diſtinguiſhed among theſe was Don Pedro, a captain of cavalry, about twenty, not very rich, but one of the firſt famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies. Handſome, polite, and witty, he drew on
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:031735_0190_0FEE252CF3B61538"/>
himſelf the eyes of all the ladies of Grenada; though he himſelf paid attention to none but Celeſtina: while ſhe, not inſenſible to his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, began, on her part, to take conſiderable notice of her admirer.</p>
               <p>Two months paſſed away without the lovers daring to ſpeak, though, nevertheleſs, they ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid a great deal. At the end of that time Don Pedro found means of conveying a letter to his miſtreſs; which informed her or what ſhe knew before. The reſerved Celeſtina had no ſooner read this letter, than ſhe ordered it to be ſent back to Don Pedro; but ſhe poſſeſſed an excellent memory, ſhe retained every word, and was able to return a very punctual anſwer a whole week afterwards.</p>
               <p>A correſpondence was now ſettled between the two lovers. Don Pedro was deſirous to be ſtill more intimate. He had long ſolicited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to converſe with Celeſtina through her latices; ſuch is the cuſtom in Spain; where the windows are of much more uſe during the night than the day. They are the places of rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. When the ſtreet is vacant and ſtill, the lover wraps himſelf up in his cloak, and, taking his ſword, invoking love and night to favour him, proceeds to ſome low latice, grated on the ſide next the ſtreet and ſecured on the inſide by ſhutters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:031735_0191_0FEE25383828E848"/>
He waits not long before the window opens, ſoftly, and the charming maid appears. She aſks, in a tremulous voice, if any one is there. Her lover, tranſported at her condeſcenſion, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to diſpel her fears: they talk in a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and repeat the ſame thing a hundred times. The gratings cannot hinder their interchanging vows; though they may prevent their kiſſes. The lover curſes the envious bars, while his miſtreſs thanks them for their friendly interpoſition. Day, at length, approaches, and they muſt ſeparate. They are an hour in taking leave; and part, at laſt, without having ſaid half the tender things they intended.</p>
               <p>Celeſtina's latice was on the ground floor, and opened into a narrow paſſage, where the houſes were ill built, and only inhabited by the lower claſs of people. Don Pedro's old nurſe happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to occupy a tenement directly oppoſite the window of Celeſtina. Pedro, therefore, repaired to his nurſe. My good woman, ſaid he, I have been much to blame to ſuffer you to live ſo long in this miſerable habitation; but I am determined to make you amends by giving you an apartment in my own houſe. Come and reſide in that, and leave me to diſpoſe of this.</p>
               <p>The honeſt women could not refrain from tears: and, for a long time, refuſed; but, at laſt, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his ſolicitations, ſhe conſented to the
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031735_0192_0FEE2539C4BB8088"/>
exchange, with every expreſſion of gratitude for the kindneſs of her benefactor.</p>
               <p>Never did any monarch enter his palace with more ſatisfaction than Don Pedro took poſſeſſion of the hovel of his nurſe.</p>
               <p>Early in the evening Celeſtina appeared at her latice. She promiſed to repair thither every other day, and ſhe kept her word. Theſe delightful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views ſerved only to increaſe the flame of love; and, very ſoon the lovers' nights were paſſed in pleaſing converſation, and their days in writing paſſionate epiſtles.</p>
               <p>At length they both arrived at that intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of delight and anxiety which is the laſt peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od of the paſſion of love.</p>
               <p>Juſt at this time Henriquez, the intended huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of Celeſtina, arrived from Salamanca; bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him a declaration of his paſſion in Latin, which had been written for him by the head of the college.</p>
               <p>The lovers conſulted each other on this event at the latice; but in the mean time the old guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian had drawn <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> contract of marriage, and a day was fixed on for the celebration of the nuptials of Celeſtina and Henriquez.</p>
               <p>Every one muſt perceive that, under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, the only remedy was to fly into Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal. This was determined on, and it was alſo ſettled that the two lovers, on arriving at Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:031735_0193_0FEE253B4BAAFFE0"/>
ſhould firſt marry, and afterwards have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the law againſt the guardian.</p>
               <p>Celeſtina was to carry with her a box of jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, which had been left her by her mother. Theſe were very valuable, and would be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to maintain the happy couple till the law-ſuit ſhould be decided in their favour. No plan could ever be laid with more prudence.</p>
               <p>Nothing was now wanting but to contrive how to effect this eſcape; and for this purpoſe, it was neceſſary to procure the key of the latice. In this Celeſtina ſucceeded.</p>
               <p>It was therefore reſolved that the next night, at eleven, Don Pedro, after having ordered horſes to wait without the city, ſhould come and fetch Celeſtina; who ſhould deſcend from the window into the arms of her lover, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſet off for Portugal.</p>
               <p>Don Pedro ſpent the whole day in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for his departure. Celeſtina, on her part, was equally buſy in getting ready the little box ſhe was to take with her. She was very careful not to omit ſecuring in it a very fine emerald, which had been given her by her lover.</p>
               <p>Celeſtina and her box were ready by eight in the evening; and before ten, Don Pedro, who had already provided carriages on the road to Andaluſia, arrived at the appointed ſpot; his heart beating with perturbation and hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="unknown:031735_0194_0FEE253F2B480078"/>
As he approached the place, he heard perſons calling for help, and perceived two men attacked by five aſſaſſins, armed with ſwords and bludge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The brave Pedro forgot his own affairs to defend the lives of the aſſaulted. He wounded two, and put the other three aſſaſſins to flight.</p>
               <p>What was his ſurpriſe, on more attentively conſidering thoſe he had delivered, to perceive they were no other than Henriquez and Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's guardian, Alonzo! Some deſperate young cavalier of the city, who was in love with Celeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina, knowing it was intended that Henriquez ſhould eſpouſe her, had hired bravoes, a ſpecies of raſcals but too common in Spain, to aſſaſſinate them; and had it not been for the valour of Don Pedro, the young ſcholar and the old miſer would have found it no eaſy matter to have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped with life.</p>
               <p>Pedro did his utmoſt to avoid their grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgements, but Henriquez, who piqued himſelf on having learned politeneſs in Salamanca, ſwore he ſhould not leave them that night. Pedro, in deſpair, had already heard the clock ſtrike eleven. Alas! he knew not the miſchief that had happened.</p>
               <p>One of the bravoes whom he had put to flight, had paſſed, muffled up in his cloak, near the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Celeſtina. The night was extremely dark, and the unfortunate fair, having opened the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:031735_0195_0FEE254731797378"/>
imagining him to be Don Pedro. She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him the box with joyful impatience.</p>
               <p>Take our diamonds, ſaid ſhe, while I deſcend.—At the word <hi>diamonds,</hi> the bravo ſuddenly ſtopped, took the box, without ſpeaking a word, and, while Celeſtina was coming down from the window, fled with the utmoſt precipitation.</p>
               <p>Imagine the ſurpriſe of Celeſtina, when ſhe found herſelf alone, in the ſtreet, and ſaw noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him whom ſhe had ſuppoſed to be Don Pedro. She thought, at firſt, he had left her to avoid raiſing ſuſpicion or alarm. She, therefore, haſtily walked to a little diſtance, looked round on every ſide, and called in a low voice. But no Pedro could ſhe ſee; no lover could ſhe hear.</p>
               <p>She was now ſeized with the moſt alarming apprehenſions. She knew not whether it was moſt adviſeable to return home, or endeavour to find the horſes and attendants of Don Pedro, that were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> out of town. She continued to walk forwards, in the utmoſt uncertainty and diſtreſs, till ſhe had loſt herſelf among the ſtreets; while her fears were redoubled by darkneſs and ſilence.</p>
               <p>At length ſhe met a perſon, whom ſhe aſked if ſhe were far from the gate of the city. The ſtranger conducted her thither, but ſhe found no body waiting as ſhe expected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:031735_0196_0FEE2548BA601780"/>
She dared not yet accuſe her lover of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her: ſtill ſhe hoped he was at no great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. She therefore, proceeded along the road, fearful at every buſh, and calling Don Pedro at every ſtep; but the farther ſhe walked the more ſhe was bewildered; for ſhe had come out of the city on the ſide oppoſite the Portugal road.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Don Pedro found himſelf unable to get away from the grateful Henriquez and his father. They would not ſuffer him to leave them for a moment, but obliged him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the houſe with them, to which Pedro, fearful of betraying his intent, and fruſtrating his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hopes, and imagining too that Celeſtina might be ſoon ſatisfied why he thus delayed, moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly conſented.</p>
               <p>Alonzo haſtens to the chamber of his ward, to inform her of the danger he had juſt eſcaped. He calls, but receives no anſwer: enters her apartment, and finds the latice open; his cries collected the ſervants, the alarm is immediately given, Celeſtina is miſſing.</p>
               <p>Pedro, in diſpair, immediately offered to go in queſt of her. Henriquez, thanking him for the concern he expreſſed, declared his reſolution of accompanying him. Pedro ſuggeſted that the probability of finding her would be greater if they took different roads. Accordingly, he haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to rejoin his domeſtice; and not doubting
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:031735_0197_0FEE254A47268160"/>
but Celeſtina had taken the road to Portugal, put his horſes on at full ſpeed. But their ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only removed him farther from the object of his love; while Henriquez galloped towards the Alpuxarian mountains, the way Celeſtina had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually gone.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Celeſtina continued to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diſconſolate, along the road that leads to the Alpuxares, ſeeking her lover. Anon ſhe heard the clattering of approaching horſes; and, at firſt, imagined it might be her beloved Pedro; but, afterwards, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of diſcovery, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of travellers, or, perhaps, robbers, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed herſelf, trembling behind ſome buſhes.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe preſently ſaw Henriquez paſs by, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a number of ſervants. Shuddering at the danger of being again in the power, and dreading a ſecond time to ſubmit to the redoubled tyranny of Alonzo, if ſhe continued in the high road, ſhe turned aſide, and took refuge in a thick wood.</p>
               <p>The Alpuxares are a chain of mountains which extend from Grenada to the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean. They are only inhabited by a few peaſants. To theſe fear and terror conducted the unfortun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate maiden. A dry and ſtony ſoil, with a few oak trees, thinly ſcattered, ſome torrents and echoing cataracts, and a number of wild goats, leaping from precipice to precipice, are the only objects
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031735_0198_0FEE254DC88E5690"/>
which preſent themſelves to the eyes of Celeſtina, as ſoon as the day begins to break. Exhauſted, at length with wearineſs and vexation, her feet being torn by the rugged ſtones over which ſhe had paſſed, ſhe ſat down under a rock, through the cliffs of which a limpid water gently ouzed.</p>
               <p>The ſilence of this grotto, the wildneſs of the landſcape around, the hoarſe and diſtant murmur of ſeveral caſcades, and the noiſe of the water near her, falling drop by drop into the baſon it had hallowed beneath, all conſpired to convince Celeſtina ſhe was alone in the midſt of a deſart, abandoned by her lover, who to her was the whole world.</p>
               <p>She ſat herſelf down on the edge of this ſtream, to vent her grief in tears, reflecting on the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies that ſeemed to threaten her; but, above all, her loſt Don Pedro, whom, at moments, ſhe ſtill flattered herſelf ſhe ſhould one day regain.</p>
               <p>It certainly was not him, ſaid ſhe, whom I ſaw carry off my diamonds. I muſt have been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken. Yet, how was it poſſible that my heart ſhould not have informed me of the truth? No doubt he is now far hence, ſeeking me with anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and diſtraction; while I, as far diſtant from him, here am periſhing.</p>
               <p>While mournfully thus ſhe ruminated, ſhe heard, at the bottom of the grotto, the ſound of the ruſtic flute.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:031735_0199_0FF098D16E7CECB8"/>
Upon ſearching, ſhe found a young goat-herd fitting at the foot of a willow, his eyes bedewed with his tears, and fixed on the water as it iſſued from its rocky ſource. In his hand he held a flageolet, and by his ſide lay a ſtaff and a little parcel.</p>
               <p>Shepherd, ſaid Celeſtina, have pity on one abandoned, and ſhew me my way among theſe mountains, to ſome village, or habitation, where I may procure, though not repoſe, at leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
               <p>Alas! madam, replied the goat-herd, I wiſh it were in my power to conduct you to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of Gadara, behind theſe rocks; but you will not aſk me to return thither, when you are informed my miſtreſs is this day to be married to my rival. I am going to leave theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, never to behold them more: and I carry nothing with me but my flute, a change of dreſs, which I have in this parcel, and the memory of the happineſs I have loſt.</p>
               <p>This ſhort account ſuggeſted a new project to Celeſtina.</p>
               <p>My friend, ſaid ſhe to the goat-herd, you have no money, which you will certainly want, when you have left this country. I have a few pieces of gold; theſe I will divide with you, if you will let me have the dreſs you ſay is in your parcel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="unknown:031735_0200_0FF09747EFD1BEB8"/>
The goat-herd accepted the offer. Celeſtina gave him a dozen ducats, and, having informed herſelf which was the road to Gadara, took her leave of the deſpairing lover, and returned into the grotto to put on her newly purchaſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe.</p>
               <p>She came out habited in a veſt of chamois ſkin, with a ſhepherd's wallet hanging by her ſide, and on her head a hat ornamented with ribbons. In this attire ſhe appeared yet more beautiful than when adorned with brocades and jewels. She took the road to the village, and, ſtopping in the market-place, enquired of the peaſants if they knew of any farmer who wanted a ſervant.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants ſurrounded her, and ſurveyed the ſtranger with admiration. The girls expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſurpriſe at the beauty of her flowing ringlets; her elegant form, her graceful manner, the brilliancy of her eyes, even though dejected, their ſuperior intelligence and mild benignity, aſtoniſh and delight all beholders. No one could conceive from whence came this beautiful youth. One imagines him a perſon of high diſtinction in diſguiſe; another, a prince, in love with ſome ſhepherdeſs; while the ſchool-maſter, who was at the ſame time the poet of the village, declared it muſt be Apollo, ſent down, a ſecond time, to keep ſheep among mortals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="unknown:031735_0201_0FF097BA25DD5818"/>
Celeſtina, who aſſumed the name of Marcelio, was not long in want of a maſter. She was hired by an aged alcade of the village, eſteemed one of the worthieſt men in the whole province.</p>
               <p>This honeſt countryman ſoon contracted the warmeſt friendſhip for Celeſtina. He ſcarcely ſuffered her to tend his flocks for a month before he gave her an employment within his houſe, in which the pretended Marcelio be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with ſo much propriety and fidelity, that he was equally beloved by maſter and ſervants.</p>
               <p>Before he had lived here half a year, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, who was more than eighty, left the entire management of all he poſſeſſed to Marcelio: he even aſked his opinion in all the cauſes that came before him, and never had any alcade decided with ſo much juſtice as he, from the time he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to be guided by the advice of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celio. Marcelio was beloved, and propoſed as an-example to all the village: his affability, his pleaſing manner, and his good ſenſe, gained every heart. See the excellent Marcelio, cried the mothers to their ſons, he is continually with his maſter, he is perpetually employed in rendering his old age happy, and never neglects his duty, like you, to run after the ſhepherdeſſes.</p>
               <p>Two years paſſed away in this manner. Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtina, whoſe thoughts were continually employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on her lover, had ſent a ſhepherd, in whom
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:031735_0202_0FF097461D25F5B8"/>
the could confide, to Grenada to procure information concerning Don Pedro, Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo, and Henriquez. The ſhepherd brought word back, that Alonzo was dead, Henriquez married, and that Pedro had not been ſeen or heard of for theſe laſt two years.</p>
               <p>Celeſtina now loſt all hopes of ever again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her lover, and, happy in being able to paſs her days in that village, in the boſom of peace and friendſhip, had reſolved to bid an etern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al adieu to love, when the old alcade, her maſter, fell dangerouſly ill. Marcelio attended his laſt moments with all the affection of a ſon, and the good old man behaved to him like a grateful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he died, and left all he poſſeſſed to the faithful Marcelio. But his will was by no means a ſufficient conſolation to his heir.</p>
               <p>The whole village mourned for the alcade, and, after his funeral rites had been celebrated with more ſorrow than pomp, the inhabitants of the place aſſembled to chuſe a ſucceſſor. In Spain, certain villages have the right of nominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own alcade, whoſe office it is to decide their differences, and take cognizances of greater crimes by arreſting and examining the offenders, and delivering them over to the ſuperior judges, who generally confirm the ſentence of thoſe ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic magiſtrates; for good laws are generally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſonant to ſimple reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="unknown:031735_0203_0FF09843ED7D0118"/>
The villagers, being met, agreed, with one voice, that no one could be ſo proper to ſucceed the late alcade as the youth whom he ſeemed to have deſigned for his ſucceſſor. The old men, therefore, followed by their ſons, came with all the uſual ceremonies to offer Marcelio the white wand, the enſign of the vacant office. Celeſtina accepted it, and ſenſibly touched by ſuch a proof of eſteem and affection from theſe good people, reſolved to conſecrate to their happineſs a life ſhe had formerly intended to dedicate to love.</p>
               <p>While the new alcade is buſied with the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of her office, let us return to the unfortun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Don Pedro, whom we left galloping towards Portugal, and continually removing farther from her he ſo anxiouſly ſought.</p>
               <p>He arrived at Liſbon, without obtaining any intelligence of Celeſtina, and immediately return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame road, to reſearch every place he had before in vain examined; again he returned to Liſbon, but without ſucceſs</p>
               <p>After ſix months ineffectual enquiry, having aſſured himſelf that Celeſtina had never returned to Grenada, he imagined ſhe might perhaps be at Seville, where he knew ſhe had relations. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he haſtened to Seville, there he found the relations of Celeſtina had juſt embarked for Mexico.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="unknown:031735_0204_0FF098713704F9E8"/>
Pedro no longer doubted but his miſtreſs was gone with them, and directly went on board the laſt ſhip which remained to ſail. He arrived at Mexico, where he found the relations, but, alas, no Celeſtina; they had heard nothing of her, he, therefore, returned to Spain. And now the ſhip is attacked by a violent ſtorm, and caſt on the coaſt of Grenada: himſelf, and a few of the paſſengers, ſave themſelves by ſwimming; they land, and make their way to the mountains, to procure aſſiſtance, and, by chance or love, are conducted to Gadara.</p>
               <p>Don Pedro, and his unfortunate companions took refuge in the firſt inn, congratulating each other on the danger they had eſcaped. While they were diſcourſing on their adventures, one of the paſſengers began to quarrel with a ſoldier, concerning a box, which the paſſenger aſſerted belonged to him.</p>
               <p>Don Pedro, deſirous to put an end to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, obliged the paſſenger to declare what it contained, opening it at the ſame time to diſcover whether he ſpoke truth.</p>
               <p>How great was his ſurprize to find in it the jewels of Celeſtina, and, among them, the very emerald he had given her. For a moment he ſtood motionleſs, examining attentively the caſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; and fixing his eyes, ſparkling with rage, on the claimant, How came you by theſe jewels? ſaid he, with a voice of terror.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="unknown:031735_0205_0FF09749748A4970"/>
What does it ſignify, replied the paſſenger, haughtily, how I came by them! it is ſufficient that I am in poſſeſſion of them.</p>
               <p>He then endeavoured to ſnatch the caſket from Don Pedro; but he, puſhing him back, inſtantly drew his ſword.</p>
               <p>Wretch, ſaid he, confeſs your crime, or you die this moment.</p>
               <p>So ſaying he attacked him with great fury: his antagoniſt defended himſelf with equal brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but preſently received a mortal wound, and fell.</p>
               <p>Don Pedro was immediately ſurrounded, and ſeized by the people of the houſe. They take him to priſon, and the maſter of the inn ſends his wife to fetch the clergyman of the pariſh that he may adminiſter ſpiritual comfort to the dying man while he runs himſelf to the alcade, to carry the caſket, and inform him of the whole adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>How great was the ſurprize, the joy, and the anxiety of Celeſtina, on perceiving her diamonds, and hearing the behaviour of the noble ſtranger.</p>
               <p>She immediately haſtened to the inn, the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter was already there, and the dying man, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his exhortations, declared in preſence of the alcade, that, two years before, as he was one night paſſing through a ſtreet in Grenada, a lady had given him that box, through a latice, telling
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:031735_0206_0FF0977868B82608"/>
him to hold it till ſhe came down, but that he immediately made off with the jewels; for which theft he aſked pardon of God, and the unknown lady, whom he had injured.</p>
               <p>Immediately after this confeſſion, he expired, and Celeſtina ran to the priſon.</p>
               <p>How did her heart palpitate with expectation! ſhe could no longer doubt but ſhe ſhould again ſee Don Pedro, but ſhe feared ſhe ſhould be known by him; ſhe therefore pulled her hat over her eyes, wrapped herſelf up in her cloak, and, preceded by her clerk and the gaoler, entered the dungeon.</p>
               <p>No ſooner had ſhe got to the bottom of the ſtairs than ſhe perceived Don Pedro. Her joy almoſt deprived her of ſpeech; ſhe leaned againſt the wall, her head ſunk on her ſhoulders, and the tears ſtreamed down her cheeks. She wiped them away, ſtopped a moment to take breath, and endeavouring to ſpeak with firmneſs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the priſoner.</p>
               <p>Stranger, ſaid ſhe, diſguiſing her voice, you have killed your companion.—What could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you to ſo horrid an action?</p>
               <p>Theſe few words were all ſhe could utter, and ſeating herſelf on a ſtone, ſhe concealed her face with her hand.</p>
               <p>Alcade, replied Don Pedro, I have committed no crime; it was an act of juſtice; but I beg for
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:031735_0207_0FF0974F605CCE28"/>
death. Death alone can end the continual miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries of which the wretch I have ſacrificed to my revenge was the firſt cauſe Condemn me, I wiſh, not to make a defence. Deliver me from a life which is hateful to me, ſince I have loſt what alone could render it delightful; ſince I can no, longer hope to find—</p>
               <p>He was unable to conclude, and his voice faintly expreſſed the name of Celeſtina.</p>
               <p>Celeſtina trembled on hearing him pronounce her name. She could ſcarcely conceal her tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, but was ready to riſe and throw herſelf into the arms of her lover. The preſence, however, of ſo many witneſſes, reſtrained her. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turned away her eyes, and faintly requeſted to be left alone with the priſoner; ſhe was obeyed.</p>
               <p>Giving a free courſe to her tears, ſhe advanced towards Don Pedro, and, offering him her hand, ſaid to him, in a moſt affectionate tone, Do you then ſtill love her who lives for you alone?</p>
               <p>At theſe words, at this voice, Pedro lifts his head, unable to believe his eyes. Oh, heaven! is it—is it my Celeſtina! or is it ſome angelic being aſſuming her form? Yes, it is ſhe. I can no longer doubt it, cried he, claſping her in his arms, and bathing her with his tears. It is my love, my life, and all my woes are ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="unknown:031735_0208_0FF0987328BF2318"/>
No, ſaid Celeſtina, as ſoon as ſhe could recover ſpeech, you are guilty of bloodſhed, and I cannot free you from your fetters; but I will repair to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow to the ſuperior judge, will inform him of the ſecret of my birth, relate to him our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and, if he refuſes me your liberty, I will return and end my days with you in this priſon.</p>
               <p>Marcelio immediately gave orders for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of Pedro from the ſubterraneous dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, to a leſs hideous place of ſecurity; took care that he ſhould want for nothing, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards returned home to prepare for his journey, the next day, when a moſt alarming event pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his departure, and haſtened the delivery of Don Pedro.</p>
               <p>Some Algerine galleys, which had for ſeveral days purſued the ſhip on board of which Don Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro was, arrived on the coaſt ſome time after the ſhipwreck; and willing to repay themſelves for the trouble they had taken, had determined to land during the night. Two renegadoes who knew the country, undertook to conduct the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians to the village of Gadara, and fulfiled their promiſe but too well.</p>
               <p>About one in the morning, when labour en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys repoſe, and villainy wakes to remorſe, the dreadful cry of <hi>to arms,</hi> was heard.</p>
               <p>The Moors had landed, and were burning and ſlaughtering all before them. The darkneſs of
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:031735_0209_0FF097547595B278"/>
the night, the groans of the dying, and the ſhrieks of the terrified inhabitants, filled every heart with conſternation. The trembling wives caught their huſbands in their arms; and the old men ſought ſuccour from their ſons. In a moment the village was in flames, the light of which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the gory ſcymitars and white turbans of the Moors.</p>
               <p>Thoſe barbarians, the flambeau in one hand and the hatchet in the other, were breaking and burning the doors of the houſes; and making their way through the ſmoaking ruins, to ſeek for victims or for plunder, returned covered with blood, and loaded with booty.</p>
               <p>Nothing is held ſacred by thoſe monſters. They force their way into the temples of the Moſt High, break the ſhrines, ſtrip off the gold, and trample the holy relics under foot. Alas! what avail to prieſts their ſacred character, to the aged their grey hairs, to youth its graces, or to infancy its innocence? Slavery, fire, devaſtation, and death, are every where, and pity is fled.</p>
               <p>On the firſt alarm and tumult the alcade made all poſſible haſte to the priſon to inform Don Pedro of the danger. The brave Pedro demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſword for himſelf and a buckler for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade. He takes Celeſtina by the hand, and makes his way to the market place. There he addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the fugitives.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="unknown:031735_0210_0FF0987546906798"/>
My friends, cries he, are ye Spaniards, and do ye fly and abandon your wives and children to the fury of the infidels?</p>
               <p>He ſtops them, collects them round him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with his own valour, and, more than human, for he is a lover and a hero, ruſhes, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre in hand, on a party of the Moors, whom he breaks and diſperſes. The inhabitants recover their recollection and their courage, and enraged behold their ſlaughtered friends, and haſten in crowds to join their leader.</p>
               <p>Pedro, without quitting Celeſtina, and ever ſolicitous to expoſe his life in her defence, attacks the barbarians, at the head of the brave Spaniards, and, dealing deſtruction to all who make reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, drive the fugitives before him, retakes the plunder and the priſoners, and only quits the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the enemy to return and extinguiſh the fires.</p>
               <p>The day began to break, when a body of troops, who had too late received information of the deſcent of the infidels, arrived from a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring town. The governor had put himſelf at their head, and found Don Pedro ſurrounded by women, children and old men; who, weeping, kiſſed his hands, with unfeigned gratitude for having preſerved their huſbands, their fathers, or their ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="unknown:031735_0211_0FF09876DF448828"/>
The governor, informed of the exploits of Don Pedro, loaded him with praiſes and careſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but Celeſtina, requeſting to be heard, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the governor, in preſence of the whole village, her ſex; giving, at the ſame time, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of her adventures, the death of the brave by Don Pedro, and the circumſtances which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him excuſeable.</p>
               <p>All the inhabitants, greatly affected with her ſtory, felt at the feet of the governor, intreating pardon for the man to whom they were indebted for their preſervation. The requeſt was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the happy Pedro, thus reſtored to his dear Celeſtina, embraced the governor, and bleſſed the good inhabitants. One of the old men then advanced. Brave ſtranger, ſaid he, you are our deliverer, but you take from us our alcade; this loſs, perhaps, outweighs your bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Double our bleſſings, inſtead of depriving us of our greateſt; remain in this village; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to become our alcade, our maſter, our friend. Honour us ſo far as to permit nothing to abate our love for you. In a great city, the cowardly and wicked who maintain the ſame rank with yourſelf, will think themſelves your equals; while here, every virtuous inhabitant will look on you as his father; next to the Deity himſelf, you will receive from us the higheſt honour; and, while life remains, on the anniverſary of
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:031735_0212_0FF097590F8D1828"/>
this day, the fathers of our families will preſent their children before you, ſaying, behold the man who preſerved the lives of your mothers.</p>
               <p>Pedro was enchanted while he liſtened to the old man. Yes, cried he, my children; yes my brethren, I will remain here. My life ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to Celeſtina, and to you. But my wife has conſiderable poſſeſſions in Granada. Our excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent governor will add his intereſt to ours, that we may recover them, and they ſhall be employed to rebuild the houſes which have been burnt by the infidels. On this condition alone will I accept the office of alcade; and though I ſhould expend in your ſervice, both my riches and my life, I ſhould ſtill, be your debtor; for it is you who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored me my Celeſtina.</p>
               <p>Imagine the tranſports of the good villagers, while Don Pedro ſpoke. The governor was a perſon of great power, and undertook to arrange every thing to his wiſh; and two days afterwards the marriage was celebrated between Celeſtina, and her lover.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the late misfortunes nothing could exceed the joy of the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The two lovers long lived in unexampled feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and, happy and virtuous themſelves, made the whole diſtrict happy and virtuous likewiſe.</p>

               <head>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF EDWARD DRINKER.</head>
               <p>EDWARD Drinker was born on the 24th of December, 1680, in a ſmall cabin near the preſent corner of Walnut and Second ſtreets in the city of Philadelphia. His parents came from a place called Beverly, in Maſſachuſetts Bay. The banks of the Delaware, on which the city of Philadelphia now ſtands, were inhabited at the time of his birth by Indians, and a few Swedes and Hollanders. He often talked to his compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of picking wortleberries, and catching rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, on ſpots now the moſt populous and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the city. He recollected the ſecond time William Penn came to Pennſylvania, and uſed to point to the place where the cabin ſtood, in which he and his friends that accompanied him were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated upon their arrival. At twelve years of age he went to Boſton, where he ſerved an apprenticeſhip to a cabinet maker. In the year 1745, he returned to Philadelphia with his fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, where he lived till the time of his death. He was four times married, and had eighteen chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, all of whom were by his firſt wife. At one time of his life he ſat down at his own table with fourteen children. Not long before his death, he heard of the birth of a grandchild to one of his grandchildren, the fifth in ſucceſſion from himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="unknown:031735_0214_0FF0987AFAF5B448"/>
He retained all his faculties till the laſt years of his life; even his memory, ſo early and ſo generally diminiſhed by age, was but little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired. He not only remembered the incidents of his childhood or youth, but the events of later years; and ſo faithful was his memory to him, that his ſon informed me that he never heard him tell the ſame ſtory twice, but to different perſons, and in different companies. His eye ſight failed him many years before his death, but his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was uniformly perfect and unimpaired. His appetite was good till within a few weeks before his death. He generally ate a hearty breakfaſt of a pint of tea or coffee, as ſoon as he got out of his bed, with bread and butter in proportion. He ate likewiſe at eleven o'clock, and never fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eat plentifully at dinner of the groſſeſt ſolid food. He drank tea in the evening, but never ate any ſupper. He had loſt all his teeth 30 years before his death (his ſon ſays by drawing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive hot ſmoke of tobacco into his mouth) but the want of ſuitable maſtication of his food did not prevent its ſpeedy digeſtion, nor impair his health. Whether the gums, hardened by age, ſupplied the place of his teeth in a certain degree, or whether the juices of the mouth and ſtomach became ſo much more acrid by time, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the office of diſſolving the food more ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:031735_0215_0FF0987C9A589930"/>
and more perfectly I know not; but I have often obſerved, that old people are more ſubject to exceſſive eating than young ones, and that they ſuffer fewer inconveniences from it. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive after news in the laſt years of his life; his education did not lead him to increaſe the ſtock of his ideas in any other way. But it is a fact well worthy to be attended to, that old age, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diminiſhing, always increaſes the deſire of knowledge. It muſt afford ſome conſolation to thoſe who expect to be old, to diſcover that the infirmities, to which the decay of nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the human body, are rendered more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the enjoyments that are to be derived from the appetite for ſenſual and intellectual food</p>
               <p>The ſubject of this hiſtory was remarkably ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and temperate. Neither hard labour, nor company, nor the uſual afflictions of human life, nor the waſtes of nature, ever led him to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper or exceſſive uſe of ſtrong drink. For the laſt 25 years of his life he drank twice every day a draught of toddy, made with two table ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of ſpirit, in half a pint of water. His ſon, a man of fifty-nine years of age, told me he had never ſeen him intoxicated The time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which he uſed ſpirituous liquors, I believe, contributed to lighten the weight of his years, and probably to prolong his life. "Give wine to him that is of a heavy heart, and ſtrong drink
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:031735_0216_0FF0975C12594FB8"/>
to him that is ready to periſh" [with age as well as with ſickneſs.] "Let him drink and forget his ſorrow, and remember his miſery no more."</p>
               <p>He enjoyed an uncommon ſhare of health, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that in the courſe of his long life he was never confined more than three days to his bed.</p>
               <p>He often declared that he had no idea of that diſtreſſing pain called the head-ach. His ſleep was interrupted a little in the laſt years of his life, with a defluxion in his breaſt, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced what is commonly called the old man's cough.</p>
               <p>The character of this aged citizen was not ſummed up in his negative quality of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; he was a man of a moſt amiable temper; old age had not curdled his blood; he was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly cheerful and kind to every body; his religious principles were as ſteady as his morals were pure; he attended public worſhip above thirty years, in the Rev. Dr. Sproat's church, and died in a full aſſurance of a happy immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. The life of this man is marked with ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral circumſtances which perhaps have ſeldom occurred in the life of an individual; he ſaw and heard more of thoſe events which are mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by time, than have ever been ſeen or heard by any man ſince the age of the patriarchs; he ſaw the ſame ſpot of earth in the courſe of his life covered with wood and buſhes, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:031735_0217_0FF0987EC14662B0"/>
of beaſts and birds of prey, afterwards become the ſeat of a city, not only the firſt in wealth and arts in the new, but rivalling in both many of the firſt cities in the old world. He ſaw regular ſtreets, where he once purſued a hare; he ſaw churches riſing upon moraſſes where he had often heard the croaking of frogs; he ſaw wharfs and warehouſes where he had often ſeen Indian ſavages draw fiſh from the river for their daily ſubſiſtence; and he ſaw ſhips of every ſize and uſe in thoſe ſtreams where he had been uſed to ſee nothing but Indian canoes; he ſaw a ſtately edifice filled with legiſlators, aſtoniſhing the world with their wiſdom and virtue, on the ſame ſpot probably where he had ſeen an Indian council; he ſaw the firſt treaty ratified between the newly confederated powers of America, and the ancient monarchy of France, with all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of parchment and ſeals, on the ſame ſpot probably where he once ſaw William Penn ratify his firſt and laſt treaty with the Indians, without the formalities of pen, ink, or paper; he ſaw all the intermediate ſtages through which a people paſs from the moſt ſimple to the moſt complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted degrees of civilization; he ſaw the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the end of the empire of Great-Britain in Pennſylvania.</p>
               <p>He had been the ſubject of ſeven crowned herds, and afterwards died a citizen of the newly
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:031735_0218_0FF098804ED6DFB8"/>
created republic of America. The number of his ſovereigns, and his long habits of ſubmiſſion to them, did not extinguiſh the love of liberty, which is natural to the mind of man in its healthy ſtate. He embraced the liberties and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of America in his withered arms, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed in the laſt years of his life in the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his country. He died Nov. 17, 1782; aged 103.</p>

               <p>MR. C—, aſſuming the name of Jones, ſome years ſince, purchaſed a ſmall piece of land, and built on it a neat houſe on the edge of a common in Wiltſhire. Here he long reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unknowing, and almoſt unknown, by the neighbourhood Various conjectures were form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſpecting this ſolitary and ſingular ſtranger; at length a clergyman took ſome notice of him, and occaſionally inviting him to his houſe, he found him poſſeſſed of intelligence and manners, which evidently indicated his origin to have been in the higher ſtations of life. Returning one day from a viſit at this clergyman's, he paſſed the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:031735_0219_0FF0976192110BB8"/>
houſe of a farmer, at the door of which was the daughter employed at the waſhing-tub. He looked at the girl a moment, and thus accoſted her—My girl, would you like to be married?" "Sir!" exclaimed the girl—"I aſked you, young woman, whether you would wiſh to be married: becauſe if you would, I will marry you." "Lord, Sir! theſe are ſtrange queſtions from a man I never ſaw in my life before." "Very likely," replied Mr. Jones; "but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am ſerious, and will leave you till ten o'clock to-morrow to conſider of it; I will then call on you again, and if I have your and your father's conſent, we will be married the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day."</p>
               <p>He kept his appointment, and meeting with the father, he thus addreſſed him: "Sir, I have ſeen your daughter; I ſhould like her for a wife: and I am come to aſk your conſent." "This propoſal," anſwered the old man, "is very extraordinary from a ſtranger: Pray, ſir, who are you? and what are you?" "Sir," replied Mr. J.

afore-mentioned united the happy pair. Three or four years they lived in this retirement, and were bleſſed with two children. Mr. J. employed great part of his time in improving his wife's mind, but never diſcloſed his own origin. At length, upon taking a journey of pleaſure with her, while remarking the beauties of the country, he noticed and named the different gentlemen's ſeats as they paſſed; and coming to a very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent one, "This, my dear," ſaid he, "is B—houſe, the ſeat of the earl of E. and if you pleaſe, we will go in and aſk leave to look at it: it is an elegant houſe, and probably will amuſe you."</p>
               <p>The nobleman who poſſeſſed this manſion was lately dead.

This nephew was the identical Mr. Jones, the hero of our ſtory, who now took poſſeſſion of the houſe, title, and eſtate, and is the preſent earl of E—!!!</p>

               <head>TACITURNITY. AN APOLOGUE.</head>
               <head type="sub">Tranſlated from the French of Abbé Blanchet.</head>
               <p>AT Amadan was a celebrated academy, the firſt ſtatute of which run thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Academicans are to think much, write little, and, if poſſible, ſpeak leſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was called the Silent Academy, nor was there a ſage in Perſia, who was not ambitious of being admitted a member. Zeb, a famous ſage, and author of an excellent little book, intitled <hi>The Gag,</hi> heard, in the diſtant provinces where he lived, there was a vacancy in the ſilent academy. Immediately he departed for Amadan, and, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving, preſented himſelf at the door of the hall where the academicians were aſſembled, and ſent in the following billet to the preſident:</p>
               <p>Zeb, a lover of ſilence, humbly aſks the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant place</p>
               <p>The billet arrived too late; the vacancy was already ſupplied. The academicians were almoſt in deſpair; they had received, ſomewhat againſt their inclination, a courtier, who had ſome wit, and whoſe light and trifling eloquence had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the admiration of all his court-acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and this learned body was now reduced to the neceſſity of refuſing the ſage Zeb, the ſcourge of bablers, the perfection of wiſdom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="unknown:031735_0222_0FF09886C7C63C00"/>
The preſident, whoſe duty it was to announce this diſagreeable news to the ſage, ſcarcely could reſolve, nor knew in which manner beſt, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his office. After a moment's reflection he ordered a flagon to be filled with water, and ſo full that another drop would have made the water run over. He then deſired them to introduce the candidate.</p>
               <p>The Sage appeared, with that ſimple and modeſt air which generally accompanies true merit. The preſident roſe, and, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word, pointed, with affliction in his looks, to the emblematical flagon ſo exactly full.</p>
               <p>The Sage underſtood from thence, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy was ſupplied, but, without relinquiſhing hope, he endeavoured to make them compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that a ſupernumerary member might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be no detriment to their ſociety. He ſaw on the floor a roſe-leaf, picked it up, and with care and delicacy placed it on the ſurface of the water, ſo as not to make it overflow.</p>
               <p>All the academicians immediately clapped their hands, betokening applauſe, when they beheld this ingenious reply. They did more, they broke through their rules in favour of the ſage Zeb. The regiſter of the academy was preſented him, and he inſcribed his name.—Nothing remained but for him to pronounce, according to cuſtom, a ſingle phraſe of thanks. But this new, and
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:031735_0223_0FF097664AC176B8"/>
truly ſilent academician, returned thanks. But without ſpeaking a word.</p>
               <p>In the margin of the regiſter he wrote the number one hundred (that of his brethren) then put cypher before the figures, under which he wrote thus:</p>
               <p>0100</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their value is no more nor leſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The preſident, with equal politeleſs and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of mind, anſwered the modeſt ſage, by plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the figure 1 before the number 100, and by writing under them thus:</p>

               <p>

               <head>THE PERFIDIOUS FRIEND. A TALE.</head>
               <p>ABASE act perpetrated under the maſk of friendſhip, excites double abhorrence, and the injury inflicted is, from the hypocriſy by which it is accompanied, much more injurious and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>John Stephens and Charles Murray had been brought up at the ſame ſchool when boys, and, though not preciſely of the ſame diſpoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inſeparable companions. Stephens was cunning, paſſionate, and ſomewhat ſelfiſh; while Murray was unſuſpicious, mild, and generous.</p>
               <p>Connections early contracted, often endure through life, in deſpite of every forbidden circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and thus the intimacy and friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Stephens and Murray continued till they had both entered on the buſy ſtage of the world; though the difference of their characters, and with it that of their circumſtances and ſituation, increaſed every day. Stephens grew rich, while Murray continued in that humble mediocrity in which he had been originally born.</p>
               <p>The familiar intercourſe however, that had ſo long ſubſiſted between them, ſtill continued; though Stephens would occaſionally give himſelf airs of ſuperiority, which the mild temper of
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:031735_0225_0FF0988B73A3D558"/>
Murray induced him to overlook, and nothing occurred to interrupt their friendſhip and good underſtanding.</p>
               <p>At length Murray married an elegant woman of ſmall fortune, and went to reſide in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, but not ſuperb houſe, on an eſtate which the wealth of Stephens had enabled him to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. Here he enjoyed the real happineſs of life without the fatiguing oſtentation of luxury, and felt that he could not have purchaſed more with all the riches of his affluent neighbour.</p>
               <p>But Stephens had ſurveyed Mrs. Murray with a paſſion which he would perhaps have called love; he was therefore more attentive than ever to his friend, more aſſiduous in his ſervices, and more frequent in his viſits than ever he had been.</p>
               <p>As he gained nothing, however, by what he conſidered as fair means, determined at length to employ others which he truſted he ſhould find more effectual, and therefore planned an artful and diabolical ſcheme to carry off Mrs. Murray by the means of hired bravoes, and ſatisfy his brutality in diſguiſe, ſo that ſhe ſhould never know by whom ſhe had been injured. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, one morning, when Mr. Murray was out, the villains who had watched their opportunity for the purpoſe, forced into the houſe, and finding her dreſſing, attempted to carry her off half na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but being met by her huſband at a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:031735_0226_0FF0988D1E968160"/>
from the houſe, they ſeverely wounded, and left him for dead, and would effectually have ſecured their prize, had not they ſuppoſed they heard the noiſe of ſome perſons on horſeback, which, ſtriking them with a kind of panic ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, they fled precipitately without accompliſhing their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The diſtreſs of this unhappy woman may be better imagined than deſcribed. Mr. Murray, however, after languiſhing long, recovered from his wounds. Mr. Stephens, of whom no ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion was entertained, ſtill continued his appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent friendſhip and his viſits; he ſeemed to feel the greateſt concern for the ſufferings of his wounded friend, and profeſſed his willingneſs to do every thing in his power for his recovery and relief.</p>
               <p>Not long after, it happened that Mr. Murray (being now nearly well of his wound) walked out in the evening with his friend Stephens, when they were aſſaulted by two footpads, who ruſhed ſuddenly on them from behind a hedge, but Mr. Stephens being a reſolute man, knocked down one of them, and the other ran away. They ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their priſoner, and took him to a cottage at a ſmall diſtance, when Mr. Murray im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately recognized him to be the very man who had wounded him in the attempt to cary off his wife; the fellow likewiſe knew his employer
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:031735_0227_0FF0976B6DE89810"/>
Stephens, who was ſo ſtruck with confuſion at this incident, that he immediately confeſſed the whole of his villainous plot, and hypocritical conduct; forcing him at the ſame time to accept of the houſe in which he lived, and a large piece of land near it, as a ſlight recompence for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury he had intended to do him; after which he ſold his eſtate in that place, and went to reſide in a diſtant part of the kingdom, where no perſon had ever heard of the baſe act of which he had been guilty.</p>

               <p>THERE is nothing ſo dangerous to a young woman, as ſuffering a man ſhe does not diſlike, to approach her lips; which too often, when moſt ſilent, betray the feelings and the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the inmoſt ſoul.

It is not that there is any immediate criminal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in a mere kiſs; but it is a freedom which, when allowed, leads to greater familiarities. It is an introduction to ſomething more capital; it is the firſt page of the preface to ſeduction and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery. If a married woman would reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dignity and honour of her condition, ſhe would be as cautious of yielding a kiſs to a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (for all men ſhould be ſtrangers but the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to her lips) as yielding her virtue; for the woman who ſuffers any kind of dalliance from a man, reduces her conſequence, and gives crude ſuſpicions to the world of her character. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may be chearful and gay, without giving their hands and mouths to teſtify their good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and eaſe. It is the ſame with the virgin. If ſhe ſuffers herſelf to be pulled about and toyed with, and kiſſed, ſhe would find thoſe very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants the foremoſt to blow up her fame. It is an idle frippery cuſtom and practiſed by no people publickly, but the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>If ladies would in general attentively attend to this obſervation, we ſhould ſee fewer unhappy marriages; for I am confident, that the woman who returns a kiſs, means to give a ſilent aſſent to the man's deſires. It is a circumſtance which rarely fails, when the man is ungenerous enough to purſue the encouragement.</p>

               <head>TREACHEROUS GUARDIAN.</head>
               <p>SOMEWHERE in the great wilderneſs of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> in an obſcure hole, dwells an old, over-grown <hi>he-ſerpent,</hi> whom men call <hi>Viperly,</hi> in every part reſembling man; but his internals ſeem the true copy of his anceſtor, firſt ſeen in the garden of Eden; many a widow and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan he had devoured, whoſe ſhadows are ſtill walking up and down the ſtreets of a famous city; yet this much I muſt needs ſay for him, he never meddled with the poor, unleſs it were to thruſt him from his gate. This creature had once a friend named <hi>Kindman,</hi> a perſon of ſome wealth, but richer far in his only child <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> whom with all his eſtate he left to the guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and truſt of his friend; and, dying, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed alſo to his care young <hi>Heartly,</hi> his deareſt friend's ſon, to whom Kindly was guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian; with a poſitive injunction that he ſhould marry his daughter when ſhe came to the age of ſixteen. Heartly was about that age when Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man died, and had a handſome eſtate left him by his father's will, which he was to poſſeſs at tweenty-one. Conſtantia, wholly left to Viper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's care, was educated from eight years old till fourteen, at a boarding ſchool, where ſhe had the good fortune to be inſtructed in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:031735_0232_0FF097705B92D680"/>
of true virtue, which her own natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation improved to a miracle, nor was ſhe leſs a proficient in all her other ornamental exerciſes. Add to theſe the beauty of her perſon, which was as extraordinary as thoſe of her mind, and you may believe ſhe might bleſs any mortal man in a marriage with her. Heartly in the mean time led an academic life about four years, and then made a trip into foreign countries for another twelvemonth, whence he returned at age to take poſſeſſion of his eſtate. He ſoon went to viſit Conſtantia, at the boarding ſchool, and the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ener he viſited her the more deſirable he found her. 'Tis true, at firſt he loved her very well in her infancy, as it were; but the thoughts of being in a manner confined to marry her, made him leſs eager of the proffered happineſs: yet ſhe always paſſionately loved him, at leaſt with as much paſſion as her tender years were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, though ſhe knew he was deſigned for her lord and maſter. In ſhort they loved each other perfectly. Heartly therefore made it his requeſt to Viperly, that he would pleaſe to remove her from the ſchool to his own houſe, which did not in the leaſt diſpleaſe him. To Viperly then ſhe was brought, where, for her ſake, Hartly took lodgings and lived with her in a pure ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and love for about a year and a half. But mark now the inſtability of human affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="unknown:031735_0233_0FF09897713C8DA0"/>
Heartly, when abroad, had contracted as he thought, an inviolable friendſhip with one <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> a young gentleman of a very great eſtate, though much inferior to him in parts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. This Richmore, one day to his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he invites to dine with him at Viperly's, in order to ſhew him the beautiful creature whom he was deſigned to marry. At the firſt ſight of her, Richmore could hardly make her any compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſo much as tell her ſhe was beautiful, becauſe he knew it too well. To ſpeak plainly, he fell wickedly in love with her. However, he had the grace, or rather the cunning to conceal it for about a quarter of a year; when finding that his friend's happineſs grew nearer and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er every hour, and that his own paſſion encreaſed every minute, he bethought himſelf of a moſt damnable expedient to prevent Heartly's bliſs, and put an end to his own torments.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince his firſt entertainment at Viperly's, he had as eaſy an acceſs to the lady, as Heartly himſelf, though in Heartly's abſence; but now his buſineſs was not ſo immediately directed to her. He came now to tempt the <hi>ſerpent,</hi> whom he luckily found at home; and after ſome compliments enticed from his hole to the tavern, where he began to tell him, that it was in his power to damn or bleſs him; and that if he would endeavour the laſt, he
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:031735_0234_0FF0989971A021D0"/>
would give him two thouſand pounds. The old one you may imagine, would not eaſily let go ſo fair a proffer; however, he told him, that if there were any thing wherein he might do him eaſe, and his own conſcience no hurt, he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him, without any reward. Said Richmore then, 'tis only to break off the deſigned marriage between Heartly and Conſtantia, for I cannot live without her. Here are two propoſitions in one, interrupted Viperly, their marriage muſt be broken off, and you enjoy her. Right, replied Richmore, but if the laſt be done, 'tother will fall of courſe; perform but this, and the money is yours the next hour.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the villainous miſer promiſed to effect it: accordingly, with ſome ſhew of reaſon, he ſoon after perſuaded Heartly to go near an hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red miles from the town to look after ſome part of his eſtate, making it ſo ſeemingly neceſſary, that the young gentleman was forced by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to leave the town in leſs than ten days time. And yet not before he had occaſion to obſerve the great intimacy and friendſhip ſo lately contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the old and young gentleman. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, fearing the worſt, he taught Conſtantia to arm herſelf againſt all misfortunes, by an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that is not frequently practiſed, becauſe there are but few young lovers about this town that know how to write a quite contrary thought with
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:031735_0235_0FF097752E1DEC68"/>
a black ink, in a manner, on the ſame lines on which they had written their true meaning in a white liquid matter, which will appear, the black being obliterated by waſhing the paper with a third water or mixture.</p>
               <p>When Viperly-thought that Heartly was far enough from him, not to ſee and hear his devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's deſigns, he brought Richmore one night with him, and was pleaſed to be very ſeemingly drunk; or, perhaps, he was really ſomething near it: and then took the liberty to tell Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia, that he had provided a better huſband for her than her father's deſcription of her fortune could give her reaſon to hope. The lady was modeſtly pleaſed to anſwer, that ſhe did truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſuch a perſon as Richmore, was infinitely beyond the merits of her perſon or fortune. Richmore replied, by the way of compliment, well enough for a ſpark of his eſtate; which he thought, without the help of words, might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to anſwer the lady's expectation; and, to ſay truth, he made a very good figure, which no doubt he was deſirous to copy. Of this he made her partly ſenſible that very night; thence ſhe began to be as apprehenſive of danger from the young man's love, as ſhe was from the old man's avarice: for within a very few days after, Viper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let her know, that it was his determinate plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhe ſhould marry Richmore, unleſs ſhe would
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:031735_0236_0FF0989C64EA0708"/>
make Heartly happy without a groat to her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which we may imagine, was none of the moſt obliging diſcourſes that ſhe had ever been entertained with. However, the diſcourſe was not all; for he gave Richmore ſuch villainous opportunities, that none but a virtue like her's could have fruſtrated his deſigns.</p>
               <p>Once he was concealed in her bed-chamber till ſhe went into bed, and had diſmiſſed her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and then all the darkneſs that her preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence could ſuffer, added ſomething more than a confidence to his deſires; which yet, I am apt to think, had been lawful, were it not for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engagement to his friend: but this wicked op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity was his ſiniſter friend, and at that firſt time he took his laſt leave of thoſe lips which would have curſed him had they been taught; at leaſt they happily deceived him, when ſhe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of him not to take the advantage of the night, ſince ſhe would willingly meet his love in a lawful honourable bed; but ſhe was confident, ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, this could be the contrivance of none but Viperly, or the devil. And continued ſhe, that you may be aſſured of my truth in this matter, procure a light, and I will immediately write to Mr. Heartly all the moſt diſobliging things that you yourſelf ſhall deſire me, and with all ſend to him under my own hand, that I will marry you within theſe ten days; for if I could not love
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:031735_0237_0FF0989E1CC29C20"/>
you, ſir, ſhe purſued, I find I muſt not expect any part of my fortune. This ſudden thought of hers, had its deſired effect upon him; ſo tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her that he would expect the performance of her promiſe before the next day noon he left her. Next morning when he underſtood he might be admitted, he came again to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where he found her writing theſe words to Heartly, upon a ſheet of paper on which ſhe had before written in white ink, a haſty ſummons to him to come to her reſcue.</p>

               <p>The day came, and Heartly had walked in that place from half an hour paſt one, till the hour appointed, when he ſaw Conſtantia led by Richmore. Upon the firſt ſight of Heartly, ſhe forced her hand from the other, and gave it to him. Richmore, ſaid he, I muſt ſee you to night at the tavern over the way, if thou canſt, without this lady, the hour is ſeven; till then farewell. Saying ſo, he walked off with her, and put her into a coach, which carried them to the houſe of a friend of his not far off. At ſeven he met Richmore, of whom he deſigned to have taken ſatisfaction, for the injuries he had done him in his abſence: but Richmore, who was conſcious of his guilt, and had really a friendſhip for him, which renewed at his ſight, told him, that poſſibly he would give him better

               <head>THE ABANDONED INFANT. A TALE.</head>
               <p>THE benevolent heart which perſiſts in an act of beneficence, notwithſtanding all the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious cenſures of meaner minds, incapable of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding its noble and diſintereſted conduct, is doubly praiſeworthy; and it ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that it does not looſe its reward in the ſenſe even of the votaries of ſelf intereſt, independent of that which it receives from the conſciouſneſs of doing good to others.</p>
               <p>Lucinda Harvey was a young lady of a moſt amiable perſon, and a truly generous and ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible heart. She had loſt her father in her early youth, and had lived with her mother, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in a village at no great diſtance from Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, on a ſmall jointure. They were not rich, but they were ſatisfied and happy; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of their deportment procured them the eſteem and friendſhip of all their neighbours.</p>
               <p>It happened, that, one evening, as ſhe walked out in a little cloſe behind the houſe, ſhe found a female infant of about a twelvemonth old, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ground, and crying piteouſly. The child had evidently been deſerted a few hours before, by ſome perſon, who had left it there to periſh, or be preſerved by chance. Lucinda
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:031735_0241_0FF09779F1BC8F28"/>
took it up and brought it in to her mother. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery enquiry was made to diſcover the perſon who had thus deſerted it, but every enquiry prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fruitleſs. The child, however, by its beauty, and helpleſs ſituation, won ſo much on the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart of the tender Lucinda, that ſhe perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her mother not to reſign it to the rigours of a pariſh maintenance; but let it be brought up with them, as if it were her ſiſter. "It can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire but little," ſaid ſhe, "and who can ſay how amply providence may repay us." The infant had hanging round its neck, when it was found, the miniature portrait of a gentleman, with the air and countenance of which Lucinda felt herſelf much impreſſed, and frequently noticed to her mother the elegance of the figure, and how ably the painter had diſplayed his art.</p>
               <p>As the child grew up, her beauty became every day more apparent; and it was manifeſt that the ſtrength of her underſtanding, and the goodneſs, gentleneſs, and generoſity of her diſpoſition muſt, in her riper years, give additional force and luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre to the charms of her perſon.</p>
               <p>But in the world in which we live, it is not to be ſuppoſed that ſo good, ſo generous a deed, ſhould entirely eſcape the inſinuations of the mean, or the cenſures of the malignant. The tea table tattlers, miſs Vapid, miſs Reſtleſs, miſs Prattle, and miſs Sneer, met on the occaſion, and
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:031735_0242_0FF09791F3AC1E70"/>
decreed, <hi>nem. con.</hi> that there was ſomething pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly dark and ſuſpicious in the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that it was monſtrouſly incredible that any young lady ſhould maintain a child from mere good nature, tenderneſs, or generoſity; and on breaking up of their convention, immortal, ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals ſtretched their eagle wings, and it ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the firm, unſhaken creed of the faſhionable goſſips of the village, that Lucinda had deigned to lie privately in, and that the child ſhe protected and cheriſhed was no other than her own.</p>
               <p>As Lucinda's perſonal and mental accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had given much ſecret offence to many of her female acquaintances, the deſtruction of her character became a delicious treat to them, and more than one gentleman of fortune, who was on the point of making honourable and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous propoſals to Lucinda, were deterred from it by theſe buzzing ſlanders. Still, however, ſhe remained firm; ſhe ſtill treated the child as her ſiſter or daughter; deigned to give no anſwer to the baſe inſinuations of little minds; nor would ſhe as her mother wiſhed, conſent to leave the place where ſuch baſe reports had been circulated.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, ten long years had rolled away, and Lucinda had not even received any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offers of marriage; and as ſhe was now eight and twenty, though her charms yet ſhone in all their luſtre, her envious rivals enjoyed their
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:031735_0243_0FF0977DEF4C2398"/>
triumph, and began to hope the time approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they might confer on her the title of Old Maid.</p>
               <p>About this time it chanced that a Mr. Horton, a gentleman who had gone out to India ſome years before, and rapidly made a fortune, returning home to enjoy the fruits of his good ſucceſs in his native country, purchaſed a houſe and eſtate in the neighbourhood of the village in which Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda and her mother reſided. He met with Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinda at the aſſembly, and being pleaſed with her converſation, made ſeveral viſits to her and her mother. Lucinda had remarked, the firſt time ſhe ſaw him, the ſtrong reſemblance there was between his features and thoſe of the portrait ſhe had found on the deſerted Laura, for by that name ſhe had called the child ſhe had found and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected: and this reſemblance excited in her breaſt a kind of eſteem for him, before ſhe became acquainted with the good qualities of his heart and underſtanding.</p>
               <p>But the ſcandalous reports that had been ſo long circulated to the diſcredit of Lucinda, were ſoon induſtriouſly tranſmitted to Mr. Horton's ear; the conſequence of which was, that his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits became much leſs frequent, and his behaviour to that lady ſenſibly different from what it had hitherto been.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="unknown:031735_0244_0FF098A4AB684E00"/>
Lucinda, now, for the firſt time, felt that the venomed ſhafts of ſlander could reach her, and deſtroy her peace: though Mr. Horton had too much politeneſs to give even the ſlighteſt hint of the cauſe of alteration in his behaviour towards her, ſhe eaſily conceived from what ſource it aroſe, and the firſt opportunity that preſented, related to him with equal candour and emotion, the ſtory of finding the child, and the ſubſequent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks made on her character by malicious ſcandal. This ſhe declared, and declared with truth, was the firſt time ſhe had felt any pain from theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations, and the firſt time ſhe had ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to defend herſelf, and ſhe had only done it now becauſe ſhe could not bear to loſe the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem of a gentleman, of whoſe good ſenſe and generoſity ſhe had too high an opinion, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he would liſten for a moment to ſuch falſe and malicious ſuggeſtions, when he had heard the truth. She ended by ſhowing him the picture ſhe had found with the child.</p>
               <p>Mr. Horton viewed the picture with equal ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and emotion; he inſtantly knew it for his own portrait, and the child for his own daughter. "Madam," ſaid he, "your innocence is appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent indeed; ſuffer me to confeſs my folly and my fault. This picture is my portrait; it has marks on it which preclude all doubt, and your Laura is my daughter. Before I went to India, I had a
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:031735_0245_0FF0977FC18632A0"/>
connection (not greatly to my honour) with a woman of mean character, by whom I had this child. I left her with what money I could ſpare, and made ſeveral remittances, but could never learn what became of her. Since my return I have made every enquiry, but have only been able to learn that ſoon after I left her, ſhe went to live with ſome fellow of a character ſimilar to her own, and has not been heard of ſince. It is probable they abandoned the child as an embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment. Your tenderneſs and generous kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have preſerved it! and if I am ſo fortunate as to be agreeable to you, my hand, my fortune, and my heart, ſhall be your's."</p>
               <p>In a ſhort time after, Lucinda was married to Mr. Horton, and, triumphing over every ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſuggeſtion, became, by law, the mother of her adopted child.</p>

               <head>A SINGULAR STORY OF MR. STANLEY.</head>
               <p>CAPTAIN James Stanley, who had been an officer in the king's army, during the civil wars which began in the year 164<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and had loſt by the ſequeſtration ſucceeding them the largeſt part of his eſtate, retired to ſpend the remnant of his days on one of his farms, which he had found means to preſerve in the name of a relation of the contrary party, and which was ſeated in that part of Gloceſterſhire which borders on the Severn.</p>
               <p>He ſurvived but a little the ruins of his cauſe, and dying in retirement, left his wife a young widow, with that farm for her jointure, whoſe rent, when laſt lett, had been about 5001. per annum: ſhe had a ſon under nine years of age, whom ſhe took from a ſchool he was ſent to in the life-time of his father, and kept him at home, as a means to divert or alleviate her ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Robert Stanley, this ſon, diſcovered a genius much bent to a love of the country. He would often delight to be preſent at the plowings, the threſhings, and ſuch other buſineſs of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and was every year diligent in picking up acorns, as they fell from ſome trees which grew about his mother's houſe which acorns he would
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:031735_0247_0FF09781DBE58A60"/>
be whole days employing himſelf in making holes for, and planting up and down in the banks of the hedge-rows or encloſure.</p>
               <p>The mother, however, was adviſed, when her ſon reached fifteen, to ſend him to London, where the law was believed the moſt hopeful employment he could follow. He was therefore recommended to the care of an attorney, with whom he lived ſeveral years; and afterwards ſetting up for himſelf, miſcarried in the buſineſs, and either through fear of his mother's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or the weight of ſome debts he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, procured recommendations for ſome ſmall preferment abroad, and went over to Jamaica, which was then newly ſettled by the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>In Jamaica, from a very narrow beginning, he obtained by the ſucceſs of his induſtry a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable plantation, and lived in that iſland al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt twenty years; at the end of which time he grew deſirous to viſit England again, and there ſettle near his mother, who was ſtill alive and impatient to ſee him.</p>
               <p>In purſuit of this view, he fold his plantation, and freighted a ſhip with his effects, put himſelf and his family on board her, and ſet ſail for Briſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol; to which he was ſo near as the iſland of Scilly, by the Land's End off Cornwall, when the ſhip by a ſtorm in the night unfortunately ſplit upon a rock, where nothing at all of her cargo,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:031735_0248_0FF098A847FF8BE0"/>
was ſaved; and with very much difficulty ſome few of the paſſengers, among whom was Mr. Stanley himſelf, thus reſtored to his country in a condition more naked and miſerable than he left it.</p>
               <p>He found means, however, to get ſoon to his mother, who received him with that mixture of ſorrow and joy which was natural to the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and when her firſt emotions were over, and her paſſions grew calm enough to hear him at large give an account of his ſhipwreck and the particulars of his loſs by it, ſhe anſwered him with a ſigh—That ſhe feared ſome misfortune would befal him wherever he was, becauſe a few days before, an unuſual high wind had blown down above a hundred of thoſe oaks which ſhe had cheriſhed for his ſake, and which he might remember when a boy, he had planted from the acorn all about the eſtate; but ſhe thanked God, there were many yet left ſtanding, which ſhe hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was a good omen, that he would overcome his misfortunes.</p>
               <p>A good omen indeed, cried Mr. Stanley, if in nigh thirty years growth they are ſo large as I wiſh them; for but a day or two ago, in the city of Briſtol, I met with a perſon who was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely employed, and is making enquiry, with a great deal of earneſtneſs, after ſound, young oak timber, a great parcel of which ſort he is commiſſioned to purchaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="unknown:031735_0249_0FF0978576750A40"/>
The end of the ſtory is, that upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they found above ſeventeen hundred ſuch oaks as they ſold for forty ſhillings a-piece, with which ſtock Mr. Stanley began a new trade, and became as conſiderable a merchant as any in the Weſt; and, in memory of this fortunate acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he preſerved from the axe about twenty of the trees which grew neareſt the houſe, which trees (though the eſtate is now fallen to another family) are known to this day by the name of 'Save-all Remnant.'</p>
               <p>This example of a gentleman preſerved from ſuch ruin, in the middle of his life, by the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and unmeaning diverſion of his childhood, together with what is told us by the famous Sir Richard Weſton, of a merchant of his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who planted with his own hands ſo much wood that he ſold it in his life-time for fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling; theſe examples, we ſay, are ſufficient to excite a new vigour in our Country Gentlemen, who might eaſily improve upon the hint, ſo far as to eaſe their eſtates of a burden which often oppreſſes, and ſometimes deſtroys them: we mean where a gentleman leaves many daughters, for whoſe fortunes the eſtate is the fund, and ſtands mortgaged to provide for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="unknown:031735_0250_0FF098AA5D25E618"/>
How eaſily were the inconvenience prevented, if at the birth of a daughter but ten acres of land were ſet out from the eſtate, and, after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carefully encloſed, were well planted with timber-trees.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, for example, they were fir-trees, which are found to thrive readily in all parts of England: four thouſand ſuch trees would grow twenty years together on ten acres of land without galling each other; at the end of which term they would, one with another, be worth twenty ſhillings a-piece for ſmall maſts for veſſels, and many other good uſes; ſo that here were (almoſt without loſs or expence) a fortune of four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds provided for the young lady by that time ſhe grows marriageable, and her father's eſtate not charged with a penny towards raiſing it.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing being done, only charging the kind of tree, planted at every new birth of a daughter or ſon, would effectually provide for them all as faſt as they grow up, like a plow kept at work for their benefit, even they were ſleeping; there is, we may hope, no elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in England who will diſlike this particular part of this eſſay, whatever his opinion may be of the other.</p>

               <head>AN INTERESTING NARRATIVE.</head>
               <p>AT the dreadful epoch of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate affair of Nancy, twenty-two ſoldiers of the regiment Chateau-Vieux were condemned to condign puniſhment. As the fatal proceſſion was paſſing through a narrow ſtreet, one of the ſoldiers condemned, contrived, amidſt the preſs, to ſlip unobſerved into a paſſage, the door of which was open. It was the houſe of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. Conceive her tranſport to find her lover in her arms, at the moment ſhe was bewailing his death.</p>
               <p>One victim at the place of execution was found wanting to the number. Search was every where made for the fugitive, but in vain. It was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with all the keenneſs, and all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity of blood-hounds; but the deſtined ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of vengeance eluded the utmoſt penetration and diligence of his purſuers. He was all this while concealed in a corn-loft, where he had been ſecreted by his miſtreſs, and where ſhe found means to nouriſh him for three months unknown to her parents.</p>
               <p>A rich farmer of Baſle, who had heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his ſon ſince the carnage of Nancy, and the horrible execution of the Swiſs, could no

For this purpoſe he undertook a journey to Nancy, but though his concern excited pity, and his enquiries intereſted all to whom they were addreſſed, there were none who could afford him the deſired information. At laſt he learned with tranſport that his ſon had eſcaped the fate of his companions, and was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by a ſoldier to the houſe of his miſtreſs, as a place where it was probable he might obtain farther intelligence.</p>
               <p>He repaired immediately to the houſe, but the miſtreſs of his ſon pretended an entire igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and notwithſtanding the particulars of his family, which he mentioned in their converſation; preſerved the moſt cautious ſilence. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, however to make enquiry, and deſired him to call in an hour. The ſoldier immediately recognized his father, from the deſcription given of him by his miſtreſs. The farmer returned to a minute.</p>
               <p>The father and ſon flew into the arms of each other with all the ardour ſuch a meeting might produce. As ſoon as the firſt tranſports were over, the father joined the hands of his ſon and his miſtreſs, and pronouncing over them a pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal benediction—"You have preſerved his life, ſaid he to her; the only recompence I can offer you is himſelf!"</p>

               <head>THE HILL OF LIFE. A VISION.</head>
               <p>A GENTLE aſcent led to a lofty emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and on the ſummit was a level plain, of no great extent. The boundaries of it could not indeed be eaſily aſcertained: for as the aſcent on one ſide was eaſy and gradual, ſo the ſlope on the other continued almoſt imperceptible till it terminated at once in an abrupt declivity.</p>
               <p>At the firſt entrance of the hill I obſerved great numbers of infants crawling on beds of primroſes, or ſleeping on pillows formed by the moſs. They frequently ſmiled, and their ſweet countenances, ſeemed to expreſs a complacency and joy in the conſciouſneſs of their new exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Many indeed wept and wailed, but their ſorrow though pungent, was ſhort, and the ſight of a pretty leaf or flower would cauſe a ſmile in the midſt of their tears; ſo that nothing was more common than to ſee two drops trickling down cheeks which were dimpled with ſmiles. I was ſo delighted with the ſcenes of innocence, that I felt an impulſe to go and play with the little tribe, when, juſt as I was advancing, I felt a wand ſtrike my ſhoulder, and turning my eyes on one ſide, I beheld a venerable figure, with a white beard, and a grey mantle elegantly thrown round him.</p>

My ſon, ſaid he, I ſee your curioſity is raiſed, and I will gratify it; but you muſt not move from this place, which is the moſt advantageous ſpot for the contemplation of the ſcene before you.</p>
               <p>You hill is the Hill of Life, a pageant which I have raiſed by the magic influence of this wand, to amuſe you with an inſtructive picture.</p>

Simplicity and innocence are their amiable qualities, and the more of them they retain in their aſcent, the happier and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier ſhall they be during the whole of their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>But raiſe your eyes a little ſpace. You ſee a lively train intent to learn, under the ſage inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who accompany them, the eaſieſt and ſafeſt way of aſcending and deſcending the hill which lies before them. They often run from the ſide of their guides and loſe themſelves among the ſhrubs that bloſſom around them. Some give no ear to inſtruction, and conſequently are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually deviating among thorns, thiſtles, nettles, and brambles. Their errors are at preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable, and few fall in the pitfalls with which the hill abounds. Joy illuminates their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Theirs are the ruddy cheek, the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eye, lively ſpirits, and unwearied activity.
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:031735_0255_0FF098B10229E4E0"/>
They retain a great ſhare of the innocence with which they ſet out, and therefore they are cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Enviable age, if reaſon were mature! But folly, wantonneſs, frowardneſs of temper, and ignorance, greatly interrupt and ſpoil their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. Fruits of delicious taſte grow around them, and flowrets of the ſweeteſt ſcent and moſt beautiful colour ſpring beneath their feet. But they ſoon grow tired of this lower part of the hill, and ambitiouſly aſpire at higher eminences.</p>
               <p>Behold them a few paces higher. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with eagerneſs, and many of them forſake the guides which have conducted them thus far in their aſcent. They haſten in their courſe, nor do they adhere to the direct road, but deviate without ſcruple. Some indeed return, but the greater part climb the hill by paths of their own choice, full of difficulty and danger. The pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls which are placed in every part of the hill are in this part very numerous, and not eaſily to be avoided by thoſe who forſake the high road. There are, indeed, no parts of the hill in which a guide is more neceſſary than here, nor any in which travellers are leſs inclined to ſeek his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>You ſee the beauty of the bloſſoms—you hear the muſic of the birds—all nature ſeems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire in affording delight; but too many of the travellers preſerve not that innocence and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which are neceſſary to give a taſte for the
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:031735_0256_0FF0978E75E62438"/>
pleaſures which are allowed. Inſtead of pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the flowers which are known to be ſafe and ſalutary, they deſire none but ſuch as are poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The aſpiring nature of the travellers leads them to continue the aſcent, and by this time you ſee they have reached the level ſummit, where you obſerve a prodigious crowd, all buſy in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of their ſeveral objects. Their faces are clouded with care, and in the ardour of purſuit they neglect thoſe pleaſures which lie before them. Moſt of them have now loſt a great ſhare of their original innocence and ſimplicity, and many of them have loſt it entirely.</p>
               <p>And now they begin to deſcend. Their cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and alacrity are greatly abated. Many limp, and ſome already crawl. The numbers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh almoſt every ſtep; for the pitfalls are multiplied on this ſide of the hill, and many of the travellers have neither ſtrength nor ſagacity to avoid them. Many delightful ſcenes remain. Fruit in great abundance grows around them. But the greater part, you may remark, are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the obvious and natural pleaſures which they might reach and enjoy, and are eagerly dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the earth for yellow duſt, on which they have placed an imaginary value. Behold one who has juſt procured a load of it, under which he is ready to ſink. He totters along in haſte to
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:031735_0257_0FF098B301813160"/>
find a hiding-place for it; but before he has found it, himſelf is hidden from our eyes: for lo! while I ſpeak, he is dropping into a pitfall. Moſt of his companions will follow him; but you ſee no one is alarmed by the example. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent is become very ſteep and abrupt, and few there are who will reach the bottom of the hill. Of thoſe few, not one advances without ſtumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the edge of the pitfalls, from which he can ſcarcely recover his feeble foot. Ah! while I ſpeak they are all gone!</p>
               <p>And is this a picture of life? ſaid I: Alas! how little do they ſeem to enjoy it! Surely ſome error muſt infatuate them all. O ſay! that I may avoid it and be happy.</p>
               <p>My ſon, ſaid my benevolent guide, do not haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily form an opinion derogatory from the value of life. It is a glorious opportunity afforded by the Creator for the acquiſition of happineſs. Caſt your eyes on yonder plain, which lies at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the hill, and behold the horrizon.</p>
               <p>I looked, and behold a cloud, tinged with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and gold, parted in the centre, and diſplayed a ſcene at which my eyes were dazzled. I cloſed them a while to recover the power of viſion, and when I opened them, I ſaw a figure in which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and benevolence were awfully united. He fat on a throne with every appearance of triumph, and at his feet lay a croſs;—and I heard a voice
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:031735_0258_0FF098B57050AAE8"/>
ſaying, "Come again, ye children of men."—And lo the plain opened in more places than I could number, and myriads of myriads ſtarted into exiſtence, with bodies beautiful and glorious. And the voice proceeded, "In my father's houſe are many manſions. Ye have all fallen ſhort of the perfection for which ye were created; but ſome have been leſs unprofitable ſervants than others; and to them are allotted the more exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places of bliſs; but there remain manſions appropriated to all the ſons of men. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the very worſt of them from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of death. Riſe therefore to your reſpective manſions, enter into the joy of the Lord." He ſaid—when the ſound of inſtruments, ſweeter than the unpurged ear ever heard, rang through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heaven's concave; and the glorified bodies beneath roſe like the ſun in the eaſt, and took their places in the ſeveral planets which form what is called our Solar Syſtem. I was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the ſight, and was going to fall on my knees, and ſupplicate to be admitted among the aſpiring ſpirits, when to my mortification, I thought I was ſuddenly placed on the ſide of the hill, where I had to climb a ſteep aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. I wept bitterly when my guide remonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated with me on the unreaſonableneſs of my tears, ſince none were to be admitted to glory who had not travelled the journey which I had
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:031735_0259_0FF098B777CEA2E8"/>
ſeen ſo many others travel. Keep innocence, ſaid he, do juſtice, walk humbly. He ſaid no more, but preparing to depart, touched me with his wand, and I awoke.</p>

               <head>AN AFFECTING NARRATIVE.</head>
               <head type="sub">From "The OBSERVER," a ſeries of Eſſays upon different Subjects, Written by R. CUMBERLAND, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr>
               </head>
               <p>THE following ſtory is ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, that if I had not had it from good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the country where it happened, I ſhould have conſidered it as the invention of ſome poet for the fable of a drama.</p>
               <p>A Portugueſe gentleman, whom I ſhall beg leave to deſcribe no otherwiſe than by the name of Don Juan, was lately brought to trial for poiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning his half-ſiſter by the ſame father, after ſhe was with child by him. This gentleman had for ſome years before his trial led a very ſolitary life at his caſtle in the neighbourhood of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremos, a town on the road between Liſbon and Badajos, the frontier garriſon of Spain. I was
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:031735_0260_0FF097904B9A8520"/>
ſhewn his caſtle, as I paſſed through that diſmal country, about a mile diſtant from the road, in a bottom ſurrounded with cork trees, and never ſaw a more melancholy habitation. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which made againſt this gentleman were ſo ſtrong, and the ſtory was in ſuch general circulation in the neighbourhood where he lived, that although he laid out the greateſt part of a conſiderable income in acts of charity, nobody ever entered his gates to thank him for his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſolicit relief, except one poor father of the Jeronymite convent in Montremos, who was his confeſſor, and acted as his almoner at diſcretion.</p>
               <p>A charge of ſo black a nature, involving the crime of inceſt as well as murder, at length reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ears of juſtice, and a commiſſion was ſent to Montremos, to make enquiry into the caſe. The ſuppoſed criminal made no attempt to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, but readily attended the ſummons of the Commiſſioners. Upon the trial it came out, from the confuſion of the priſoner, as well as from the depoſition of witneſſes, that Don Juan had lived from his infancy in the family of a rich merchant at Liſbon, who carried on a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trade and correſpondence in the Brazils. Don Juan being allowed to take the merchant's name, it was generally ſuppoſed that he was his natural ſon, and a clandeſtine affair of love hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been carried on between him and the merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:031735_0261_0FF098B96E638CA0"/>
daughter Joſepha, who was an only child, ſhe became pregnant; and a medicine being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to her by the hands of Don Juan, ſhe died in a few hours after, with all the ſymptoms of a perſon who had taken poiſon. The mother of the young lady ſurvived her death but a few days, and the father threw himſelf into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Mendicants, making over, by deed of gift, the whole of his property to the ſuppoſed murderer.</p>
               <p>In this account there ſeemed a ſtrange obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of facts; for ſome made ſtrongly to the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination of Don Juan, and the laſt mentioned cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance was of ſo contradictory a nature, as to throw the whole into perplexity; and therefore to compel the priſoner to a further elucidation of the caſe, it was thought proper to interrogate him by torture.</p>
               <p>Whilſt this was preparing, Don Juan without betraying the leaſt alarm at what was going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, told his judges that it would ſave them and himſelf ſome trouble, if they would receive his confeſſion upon certain points, to which he would truly ſpeak, but beyond which all the tortures in the world could not force one ſyllable. He ſaid he was not the ſon, as it was ſuppoſed, of the merchant with whom he lived, nor allied to the deceaſed Joſepha any otherwiſe than by the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt ties of mutual affection, and a promiſe of
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:031735_0262_0FF09795570F36A8"/>
marriage, which, however, he acknowledged he had not ſolemnized: That he was the nſo of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of conſiderable fortune in the Brazils, who left him an infant to the care of the merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in queſtion: That the merchant, for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beſt known to himſelf, choſe to call him by his own name; and this being done in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he was taught to believe, that he was an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan youth, the ſon of a diſtant relation of the perſon who adopted him; he begged his judges therefore to obſerve, that he never underſtood Joſepha to be his ſiſter: That as to her being with child by him, he acknowledged it, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God forgiveneſs for an offence, which it had been his intention to repair by marrying her: That with reſpect to the medicine, he certainly did give it her with his own hands, for that ſhe was ſick in conſequence of her pregnancy, and being afraid of creating alarm or ſuſpicion in her parents, had required him to order certain drugs from an apothecary, as if for himſelf, which he accordingly did; and he verily believed they were faithfully mixed, inaſmuch as he ſtood by the man whilſt he prepared the medicine, and ſaw every ingredient ſeparately put in.</p>
               <p>The judges thereupon aſked him, if he would take it on his conſcience to ſay, that the lady did not die by poiſon? Don Juan, burſting into tears for the firſt time, anſwered, to his eternal
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:031735_0263_0FF097A26387EE98"/>
ſorrow he knew that ſhe did die by poiſon—Was that poiſon contained in the medicine ſhe took?—It was—Did he impute the crime of mixing the poiſon in the medicine to the apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, or did he take it on himſelf?—Neither the apothecary nor himſelf was guilty—Did the lady from a principle of ſhame (he was aſked) commit the act of ſuicide, and infuſe the poiſon without his knowledge?—He ſtarted into horror at the queſtion, and took God to witneſs, that ſhe was innocent of the deed.</p>
               <p>The judges ſeemed now confounded, and for a time abſtained from any further interrogatories, debating the matter amongſt themſelves by whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; when one of them obſerved to the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that according to his confeſſion he had ſaid ſhe did die by poiſon, and yet by the anſwers he had now given, it ſhould ſeem as if he meant to acquit every perſon on whom ſuſpicion could poſſibly reſt: there was however one interrogatory left, which, unnatural as it was, he would put to him for form's ſake only, before they proceeded to greater extremities, and that queſtion involved the father or mother of the lady—Did he mean to impute the horrid intention of murdering their child to the parents?—No, replied the priſoner in a firm tone of voice, I am certain no ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ever entered the hearts of the unhappy parents, and I ſhould be the worſt of ſinners, if I
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:031735_0264_0FF098BB27ED1990"/>
imputed it to them. The judges upon this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared with one voice, that he was trifling with the court, and gave orders for the rack; they would however for the laſt time demand of him, if he knew who it was that did poiſon Joſepha? to which he anſwered without heſitation, that he did know, but that no tortures ſhould force him to declare it, and they might diſpoſe of him as they ſaw fit; he could not die in greater tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than he had lived.</p>
               <p>They now took this peremptory recuſant, and ſtripping him of his upper garments, laid him on the rack; a ſurgeon was called in, who kept his ſingers on his pulſe; and the executioners were directed to begin their tortures. They had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him one ſevere ſtretch by ligatures fixed to his extremities and paſſed over an axle, which was turned by a windlaſs: the ſtrain upon his muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and joints, by the action of this infernal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine was dreadful, and Nature ſpoke her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by a horrid craſh in every limb; the ſweat ſtarted in large drops upon his face and boſom; yet the man was firm amidſt the agonies of the machine, not a groan eſcaped, and the fiend who was ſuperintendant of the helliſh work, declared they might encreaſe his tortures upon the next tug, for that his pulſe had not not varied a ſtroke, nor abated of its ſtrength in the ſmalleſt degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="unknown:031735_0265_0FF09798EF208F58"/>
The tormentors had now began a ſecond oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation with more violence than the former, which their deviliſh ingenuity had contrived to vary, ſo as to extort acuter pains from the application of the engine, to parts that had not yet had their full ſhare of the firſt agony; when ſuddenly a Monk ruſhed into the chamber, and called out to the judges to deſiſt from torturing that innocent man, and take the confeſſion of the murderer from his own lips. Upon a ſignal from the judges, the executioners let go the engine at once, and the joints ſnapped audibly into their ſockets with the elaſticity of a bow. Nature ſunk under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion, and Don Juan fainted on the rack. The Monk immediately with a loud voice exclaimed, Inhuman wretches, delegates of hell, and agents of the devil, make ready your engine for the guilty, and take off your bloody hands from the innocent; for behold! (and ſo doing he threw back his cowl) behold the father and the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of Joſepha!—</p>
               <p>The whole aſſembly ſtarted with aſtoniſhment; the judges ſtood aghaſt; and even the demons of torture rolled their eye-balls with horror and diſmay.</p>
               <p>If you are willing, ſays he to the judges, to receive my confeſſion, whilſt your tormentors are preparing their rack for the vileſt criminal ever ſtretched upon it, hear me! if not, ſet your
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:031735_0266_0FF098BE02B09940"/>
engine to work without further inquiry, and glut your appetites with human agonies, which once in your lives you may now inflict with juſtice.</p>
               <p>Proceed ſaid the ſenior judge.</p>
               <p>That guiltleſs ſufferer, who now lies inſenſible before my eyes, ſaid the Monk, is the ſon of an excellent father, who was once my deareſt friend; he was confided to my charge, being then an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, and my friend followed his fortunes to our ſettlements in the Brazils: he reſided there twenty years without viſiting Portugal once in the time; he remitted to me many ſums of money on his ſon's account. At this time a helliſh thought aroſe in my mind, which the diſtreſs of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and a paſſion for extravagance inſpired, of converting the property of my charge to my own account. I imparted theſe ſuggeſtions to my unhappy wife, who is now at her account; let me do her the juſtice to confeſs ſhe withſtood them firmly for a time. Still fortune frowned upon me, and I was ſinking in my credit every hour; ruin ſtared me in the face, and nothing ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and immediate diſgrace but this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous expedient.</p>
               <p>At laſt perſuaſion, menaces, and the impending preſſure of neceſſity conquered her virtue, and ſhe acceded to the fraud. We agreed to adopt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant as the orphan ſon of a diſtant relation of our own name. I maintained a correſpondence with
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:031735_0267_0FF0979B5E0EC360"/>
his father by letters pretended to be written by the ſon, and I ſupported my family in a ſplendid extravagance by the aſſignments I received from the Brazils. At length the father of Don Juan died, and by will bequeathed his fortune to me in failure of his ſon and heirs. I had already advanced ſo far in guilt, that the temptation of this contingency met with no reſiſtance in my mind; and determining upon removing this bar to my ambition, I propoſed to my wife to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the prize that fortune had hung within our reach, by the aſſaſſination of the heir. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from the idea with horror, and for ſome time her thoughts remained in ſo diſturbed a ſtate, that I did not think it prudent to renew the attack. After ſome time, the agent of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed arrived in Liſbon from the Brazils, and as he was privy to my correſpondence, it became neceſſary for me to diſcover to Don Juan who he was, and alſo what fortune he was intitled to. In this criſis, threatened with ſhame and detection on one hand, and tempted by avarice, pride, and the devil on the other, I won over my reluctant wife to a participation of my crime, and we mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that doſe with poiſon, which we believed was intended for Don Juan, but which in fact was deſtined for our only child.</p>
               <p>She took it; Heaven diſcharged its ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on our heads, and we ſaw our daughter
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:031735_0268_0FF098C0169A77F0"/>
expire in agonies before our eyes, with the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aggravation of a double murder, for the child was alive within her. Are there words in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to expreſs our lamentations? Are there tortures in the reach of even your invention to compare with thoſe we felt? Wonderful were the ſtruggles of nature in the heart of our expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring child: ſhe bewailed us, ſhe conſoled, nay ſhe even forgave us. To Don Juan we made immediate confeſſion of our guilt, and conjured him to inflict that puniſhment upon us which juſtice demanded, and our crimes deſerved. It was in this dreadful moment that our daughter with her laſt breath, by the moſt ſolemn adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, exacted and obtained a promiſe from Don Juan not to expoſe her parents to a public exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution by diſcloſing what had paſſed. Alas! alas! we ſee too plainly how he kept his word: behold, he dies a martyr to honour! your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal tortures have deſtroyed him.—</p>
               <p>No ſooner had the Monk pronounced theſe words in a loud and furious tone, than the wretched Don Juan drew a ſigh; a ſecond would have followed, but Heaven no longer could tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the agonies of innocence, and ſtopped his heart for ever.</p>
               <p>The Monk had fixed his eyes upon him, ghaſtly with terror; and as he ſtretched out his mangled limbs at life's laſt gaſp, Accurſed monſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:031735_0269_0FF097A08FB68988"/>
he exclaimed, may God requite his murder on your ſouls at the great day of Judgment! His blood be on your heads, ye miniſters of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! For me, if heavenly vengeance is not yet appeaſed by my contrition, in the midſt of flames my aggrieved ſoul will find ſome conſolation in the thought, that you partake its torments.</p>
               <p>Having uttered this in a voice ſcarce human, he plunged a knife to his heart, and, whilſt his blood ſpouted on the pavement, dropped dead upon the body of Don Juan, and expired without a groan.</p>

               <head>NOURADIN AND FATIMA. AN EASTERN TALE.</head>
               <p>IN one of the moſt beautiful vallies that lies upon the borders of the capital of the Eaſt, lived Jezdad, an innoffenſive ſhepherd; he had but one child, and having been bereft of his wife for many years, his whole ſtock of tenderneſs was beſtowed on Fatima. Though fortune had not been laviſh of her gifts to the father of Fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, yet he wanted not the neceſſaries or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:031735_0270_0FF098C1F163B128"/>
of life; his cottage was clean, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every thing uſeful; his fields and flocks ſupplied them with food and raiment. Fatima was coarſe in her perſon, but ſhe was chearful and good-natured: She roſe with the feathered ſongſters, and, while performing the duties of her ſtation, carolled forth ſome ſimple ditty in wild untutored notes. Her whole ſtudy was to pleaſe her father, and to prepare his meals. She never repined at hard labour, and a ſmile from Jezdad was like a cordial to revive her ſpirits. When oppreſſed with fatigue, ſhe would aſſiſt, unaſked, in the moſt laborious employments; and at eve, by the pale light of Cynthia, ſhe would lightly trip with her young companions, while her fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er played on the flagelet. The mind of Fatima was as calm as the delights of Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>One day ſhe was ſent to the grand viſier's with fruits for his favourite, and was conducted by an eunuch into the garden, where the beautiful Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira was repoſing on a bed of roſes, clad in all the pomp of eaſtern magnificence, while two ſlaves were fanning her to reſt. Fatima had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen aught but ſimplicity. She was filled with wonder and aſtoniſhment at the ſurpriſing beauty and grandeur of Semira, and as ſhe gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, envy and diſcontent crept into her hitherto guileleſs boſom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="unknown:031735_0271_0FF098C4193F8040"/>
She returned home with a mind totally chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what it was; her rural paſtimes no more delighted—labour was now a trouble. She had been a witneſs to the caſe and indolence of Semira; if ſhe caught a glimpſe of her own ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in the ſtream, ſhe turned from it with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and diſguſt. Her days were joyleſs, and her nights ſpent in moaning and bewailing her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy lot. The colour fled from her cheeks, and ſhe became the picture of deſpair.</p>
               <p>One evening, deaf to the ſolicitations of her young companions, ſhe retired to a thick grove, and, inattentive to the diſtant notes of the flage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, thus found vent for her grief:</p>
               <p>"Oh! wretched Fatima, unhappy maid! Why was I born to know ſo hard a fate, to eat the bread of labour, and ſleep upon a peaſant's home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couch; while Semira is ſurrounded with ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, is ſerved by kneeling ſlaves, and ſleeps on a bed of down!—And why has nature denied me thoſe raviſhing beauties it has ſo bountifully ſhowered on her; her eyes ſo ſparkling, her lips ſo tempting red, and then her hand and arm ſo finely turned, ſo delicately white!—Oh! why was I not lovely as Semira, and favourite to the grand viſier?—But my own being is intolerable, I will no longer bear it, but in yon limpid ſtream loſe at once myſelf, and the remembrance of Semira."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="unknown:031735_0272_0FF098C602FCBD70"/>
She roſe from the ground, and was haſtening towards the brook, when the genii Nouradin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and thus addreſſed her:</p>
               <p>"Thy complaints are juſt, O Fatima! and if thou wilt relinquiſh thy home, and forſake thy father, thou ſhalt enjoy the utmoſt extent of thy wiſhes."</p>
               <p>Fatima complied, and the genii touching her with his wand, and ſprinkling her with myſtic water, ſhe was transformed into a beautiful vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, and was conveyed into the garden of one of the palaces belonging to the grand viſier.</p>
               <p>The beautiful Semira had the day before of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended her lord, and was no longer a favourite. Fatima attracted the notice of the viſier; he took her into the palace, he clothed her with rich ſilks, adorned her with jewels, and ſhe ſupplied the place of the degraded Semira.</p>
               <p>Fatima now thought herſelf the happieſt among the happy; but the viſier was paſſionate, caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and exceedingly cruel. It was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe found that the favourite of the grand vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier lived only in ſplendid ſlavery. But though ſaid ſhe often to herſelf, though the grand viſier's favourite is miſerable, how ſuperlatively happy muſt be the favourite ſultana of my lord the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. Oh! could I but fill that envied place, how ſoon ſhould the imperious viſier ſuffer for his barbarity to me. Again did the boſom of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:031735_0273_0FF097A41480FA48"/>
experience all the miſeries of diſcontent;—the vaulted roofs, ſpacious gardens, and rich preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of the viſier no longer charmed; ſhe ſighed for the enſigns of royalty, and her pillow was nightly bedewed with her tears.</p>
               <p>One evening ſhe retired to an arbour at the extremity of the garden, and throwing herſelf on the bank where ſhe had firſt ſeen Semira, thus poured forth her complaints.</p>
               <p>"Oh! miſerable Fatima! how hard, a lot is this!—Condemned to drag out a wretched life with a man who ſtudies only his own gratification, and expects me to be the ſlave of his caprice and paſſion.—Oh! could I but get from this deteſted place, I would fly to my lord the emperor, and bow myſelf low in the duſt before him;—my charms might captivate his royal heart, and I might nobly reign empreſs of the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>As ſhe ſpoke theſe words a ſudden light en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the arbour, and the genius Nouradin ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before her.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful Fatima," ſaid he, "forbear your complaints; the prophet permits you to enjoy your wiſh; then riſe, and inſtantly follow me."</p>
               <p>The genii inſtantly tranſported her to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's palace, and placed her along with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of beautiful virgins, which were the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be ſhewn to the emperor, that he might chuſe a favourite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="unknown:031735_0274_0FF097B89C488250"/>
In the morning, the emperor paſſed through the apartment, and his choice fell upon Fatima. She was clothed in all the enſigns of royalty, led in ſtate to the moſque, and in a few hours after, heard herſelf proclaimed empreſs of the Eaſt.</p>
               <p>But deluded Fatima, to the idea of royalty had connected the ideas of youth and beauty. How ſurprized was ſhe to find the emperor old, ugly, and deformed in his perſon, moroſe in his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and jealous to an extreme. She ſhrunk from him with horror, and contracted ſo ſettled an averſion to his perſon, that it was not all the grandeur and pomp that atttended her could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for her being obliged to ſuffer his loathed embraces.</p>
               <p>Among the ſlaves that attended on Fatima was the beautiful Zynina, who had long with envious eyes beheld the enſigns of royalty beſtowed on others, and only watched an opportunity to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate herſelf with the emperor; to this end ſhe artfully cultivated the friendſhip of the new queen, and, by degrees, drew from her the reaſon of her tears and dejection. This intelligence was inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed to the emperor, with the addition of Fatima's heart being dedicated to another. The emperor, willing to be convinced of the ſincerity of Zynina's declaration, deſired to be concealed in an apartment adjoining to the queen's, where he might eaſily hear any thing that paſſed between
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:031735_0275_0FF097A7CF264BC0"/>
her and the deceitful ſlave, who immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her miſtreſs, and renewed the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Fatima, glad to unburthen her almoſt breaking heart, was eaſily led to confeſs her ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled averſion to her lord; and that death itſelf would be preferable to her preſent ſituation.—"Then death be thy portion!" cried the enraged emperor, furiouſly ruſhing into the room, and lifting his glittering ſcymitar.</p>
               <p>Fatima fell upon her knees, and, burſting into a flood of tears, cried, "Oh! that I was an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cottager, and had never known the pangs that wait on greatneſs!" At that inſtant ſhe found herſelf clad in her former homely apparel, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by her father's cottage, when the genius again appeared, and thus addreſſed her.</p>
               <p>"Fatima, I have ſhewn you the vanity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wiſhes; learn from hence to be content with the allotments of Providence. Whatever be your ſituation in life, ſubmit to it without repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and know, that our holy prophet, who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth all things in this terreſtial globe, knoweth what is beſt for mortals; therefore, fulfil the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective duties of thy ſtation to the beſt of thy power; envy not the wealth or ſplendour of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but humbly take the bleſſings within thy reach, enjoy them, and be thankful."</p>

               <head>THE HAPPY COTTAGER; or the REWARD OF VIRTUE. A TALE.</head>
               <p>A REMOTE village in Oxfordſhire, famed for its rural beauties, was poſſeſſed of a poor yet induſtrious cottager, who had a lovely daughter and his only child. The innocent ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of her manners, blended with paternal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for an aged and only parent, rendered her charms peculiarly faſcinating and amiable.</p>
               <p>Sylvia was ſo extremely beautiful, and the ſymmetry of her features ſo exquiſitely delicate, that a young gentleman in the ſame village, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a liberal fortune, refined accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and engaging condeſcenſion, was ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently attached to her perſon, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſpatching his ſervant with preſent <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> rank, deſired him not to acquaint the object of his admiration from whom ſuch tokens of eſteem were ſent. The ſervant of Mr. Norman (which was the gentleman's name) made ſuch frequent viſits to the humble cottage of our fair heroine, that the fond protector of his female offspring became alarmed for the ſafety of his affectionate child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="unknown:031735_0277_0FF097AD71613858"/>
Three days had ſcarcely elapſed, before the faithful meſſenger was again ſent to relieve the diſtreſſed father of his beloved Sylvia; a purſe of gold was preſented to the ruſtic cottager, with a letter to the following purport:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <p>The trifling tokens of eſteem which your daughter has received from an unknown perſon, I am perſuaded muſt have created ſome little uneaſineſs in your mind.

               <p>Sylvia peruſed the letter with great attention, and pathetically exclaimed, "My dear father, the numerous preſents I have received from an unknown friend, proves to be from Mr. Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of our village—the aſſiſtance you have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe experienced, comes from the ſame kind benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor!—How ſhall we thank him enough?" Upon

which her aged parent replied, "My dear child, it is not in our power to make Mr. Norman the ſmalleſt acknowledgment for the favours he has beſtowed on us. Alas! may heaven be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his goodneſs, is my ardent prayer." He had ſcarce uttered the laſt ſentence when a flood of tears, the reſult of gratitude, bedewed his wrinkled cheeks.</p>
               <p>A ſhort time had only expired, before Mr. Norman and his ſervant rode up to the cottage door, upon which he beheld his lovely Sylvia dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igently ſitting at a ſpinning-wheel. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately alighted, when ſhe with the modeſt bluſh of nature accoſted him, and begged he would be ſeated under their humble roof; upon which he ſat down with apparently more real ſatisfaction than in his own ſuperb manſion.</p>
               <p>The following is a ſhort delineation of his converſation to the father of Sylvia:</p>
               <p>"My good and worthy cottager, I have long entertained a ſecret and tender paſſion for your moſt virtuous daughter; I am now come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my honourable intention; my future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and comfort depends entirely on your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation for me as a ſon-in-law; the remainder of your days will, I hope, be made happy through the medium of my fortune, which ſhall be at your daughter's diſpoſal on the day of marriage.</p>

                  <pb n="280" facs="unknown:031735_0279_0FF098CCC1BC4660"/>
The honeſt cottager replied, "My good ſir, my daughter is not worthy of ſo good a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as you are; it diſtreſſes me to think you will have ſo poor a relation as me—my heart is too full of gratitude to ſay more."</p>
               <p>Mr. Norman and Sylvia were happily united a ſhort time after this interview; and from the obſcure roof of a cottage, ſhe removed to a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did manſion, where ſhe was univerſally reſpected as the wife of Mr. Norman; her fond parent was alſo made comfortable for life.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="tale">
               <head>ACCOUNT OF A REMARKABLE TRIAL BY COMBAT.</head>
               <p>THE Chevalier John Carouge, vaſſal of the count d'Alencon, who was married to a young and beautiful lady, was obliged to make a ſea-voyage on ſome occaſion, in which his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was at ſtake; he accordingly left his wife at his caſtle, where ſhe was obſerved to comport herſelf with great prudence. It happened (ſays the hiſtorian Froiſſard, who relates this affair) that the devil entered into Jacques le Gris, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vaſſal to the count d'Alencon, and by his wicked temptations inſpired him with a deſire to enjoy the lady of the chevalier Carouge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="unknown:031735_0280_0FF098CEC44838D0"/>
Accordingly, as the witneſſes at the trial de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, on a certain day, and at a certain hour, he mounted one of the count d'Alencon's horſes, and rode to Argenteiul, where ſhe reſided. His reception was ſuch as was due to the friend of her huſband, and the adherent of the ſame noble family. She ſhewed him the caſtle; and upon his requeſting to ſee the tower, ſhe conducted him thither, without being accompanied by any of her domeſtics. When they were there, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques le Gris ſhut the door, took the lady in his arms, and, as he was a powerful man, preſently ſatisfied his deſires. The lady ſeeing herſelf thus diſhonoured, ſaid to him, "Oh Jaques, Jaques! you have not done well: the blame ſhall not reſt upon me; aſſure yourſelf, that if ever my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band returns, it ſhall light upon your own head." Jaques ſeemed not to notice her menace, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted his horſe, and rode back to the count d'Alencon's caſtle full ſpeed.</p>
               <p>He had been ſeen at four o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the caſtle, and at nine the ſame morning he was at the count's levee; which particular circums;tance it is neceſſary to remark.</p>
               <p>The lady's huſband at length returned, and ſhe received him with the utmoſt tenderneſs. The day paſſed away, and the night came; the chevalier went to reſt, and his wife walked about the chamber, croſſing herſelf at intervals,
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:031735_0281_0FF097B1F5765720"/>
till ſuch time as every body was gone to bed. She then went to her huſband's bedſide, fell on her knees, and related what had happened to her, with great grief. At firſt he could not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit what ſhe told him; but after ſome time, perſuaded by her tears and proteſtations, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of vengeance. The friends and relations of himſelf and lady were accordingly aſſembled and conſulted; and the general opinion was, that the deciſion of the affair ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the count d'Alencon.</p>
               <p>The parties were quickly ſummoned; the count ſat to hear their depoſitions; and after many arguments on both ſides, concluded, that the lady had dreamed the tranſaction; for he thought it impoſſible, that a man could ride 23 leagues, and commit the crime, with all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, of which the defendant was accuſed, in four hours and a half, which was the ſole interval that Jaques le Gris was miſſing from the caſtle. They were therefore forbidden to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the matter any further.</p>
               <p>The Chevalier Carouge, however, who was a perſon of courage and delicate ſenſe of honour, was not ſatisfied with this deciſion, but brought the cauſe before the tribunal of Paris; by which it was ordered to be decided by ſingle combat: and the king who was then at Sluys in Flanders, ſent a courier to defer the day of combat till his
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:031735_0282_0FF0973F00AA93F8"/>
return, it being his deſire to be preſent. Among many others, the Dukes of Berry, Burgundy, and Bourbon, came alſo to Paris, to be witneſſes of this intereſting ſpectacle.</p>
               <p>The place appointed was St. Catherine's; ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds were erected for the public; and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants were armed cap-a-pee. The lady, dreſſed in black, was ſeated under a kind of throne; her huſband, as he entered the lifts, approached her, and ſaid—'Madam, from your recital, and in your quarrel, I am going to expoſe my life in mortal combat againſt Jaques le Gris; it is beſt known to you whether or not my cauſe is juſt and good.' To which ſhe replied—'Monſieur, aſſure yourſelf it is; and therefore fight in full ſecurity.' The Chevalier then took her hand, kiſſed it, made the ſign of the croſs, and mounted.</p>
               <p>The lady continued in prayer during the whole combat: her ſituation was truly critical; if her champion was vanquiſhed, ſhe was condemned to be hung and burnt without mercy.</p>
               <p>The advantages of ground and ſun were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, as was the cuſtom, between the two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants; each ran his-career with the lance; but as they were both ſkilful, neither of them receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any wound at this kind of attack; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſmounted to fight on foot.</p>
               <p>The Chevalier Carouge received the firſt wound in the thigh; his friends trembled for him; and
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:031735_0283_0FF098D30627F168"/>
his poor lady was more dead than alive: but he recovered, and fell upon his enemy with ſo much impetuoſity and addreſs, that he threw him to the earth, and plunged his ſword in his body. He then turned towards the ſpectators, and aſked them if he had done his duty; to which they anſwered with one voice 'Yes!'</p>
               <p>The body of Jaques le Gris was abandoned to the executioner; who hung it on a hill near Paris, where it was left to periſh.</p>
               <p>The conqueror, after the victory, went and threw himſelf at his Majeſty's feet; who praiſed him for his valour, inſtantly gave him a thouſand livres, with a penſion of two hundred per annum, and appointed him one of the gentlemen of his chamber. He then ran to his lady, kiſſed her, and went with her to the cathedral, where they mutually returned thanks, and left their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>Thus was an accuſation of this ſerious nature ſuppoſed to be proved. The hiſtorian who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates the combat, makes no reflections on the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of error; for it was not permitted to doubt of the guilt of Jaques le Gris after he had been thus ſolemnly vanquiſhed.</p>
