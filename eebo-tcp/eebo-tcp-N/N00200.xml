            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe general acceptance this Discourse found in the time of it, together with the earnest desire of many that it might be published for their further benefit, as also the intreaty of the honoured Court of Deputies who invited to the preaching of it (which I acknowledge to the praise of that gracious guidance and assistance given from the Lord to the unworthy Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) hath occasioned the exposing it to publick view. The worth of the Author will not much commend it to any, but that of the Subject may, it being of that absolute and universal necessity, and excellency, both for the spiritual, as well as outward happiness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this whole people, so also of each particular person; as the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Generation immediately foregoing abundantly testifies. You must not expect any curiosity or quaintness, the design of it being to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>difie more then to please, any further than pleasing is a means to edification, and where there is so good a frame as to be most satisfied with that by which they may be most spiritually profited. I remember what I have heard were some of the dying words of that excellent man Dr. <hi>Usher,</hi> that he thanked God he had been a plain Preacher, and used that way which the Lord is wont to accompany with the demonstration of his Spirit: it is by that way of preaching which the world counts foolishness, that God will save them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. I doe not by this aime at my own credit, nor expect it will be promoted by it; but if I doe decrease so Christ may increase, I shall account it my glory, and the matter of my praise. If Faith and Love to God in Christ, and to his People (the spring of evangelical obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the way to Gods Covenant Presence with us) may hereby be furthered, I shall thereby obtain my design. In the applicatory part, I have rather laid down rules how each should carry it in their several capacities, then reproved any for miscariages in them, as
<pb facs="unknown:000260_0003_0FA410DA48013990"/>
judging in the best way to the end: such misdemeanors of publick Persons being more in report then proofs, that never truly represents any man. Besides, <hi>Regular est index sui et obliqui,</hi> &amp; wise, if good men will use it as a glass to discover faults for the rectifying what is amiss, as well as direction to them in the right way: and where they are not so, it is a means God blesseth for that end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. when God so commissioneth it, as he did the commandment to Paul.</p>
            <p>My hearty desire is, the gracious presence of God may be with it, to promove thine and his Peoples happiness, by engaging your ende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AFter I had received the invitation and call to this service, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not express the Soul tremblings I had, (indeed sense of my own unfitness at any time to speak before such an Assembly as this, and upon such an occasion; especially in a day so circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced as this is,) lest you should be disappointed of that, which you so much need, the best Counsel Heaven can afford. But being satisfied your desire was the Lords Call, I was so far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged as to venture upon it, in expectation of divine Assistance: And now humbly beg this may be the wish of this whole Assembly, all the Lords people in it, that <hi>G</hi>od may be with me as he hath been with those who have formerly spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his Name, upon the like occasion; that through the help of your prayers, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, that which is lacking may be supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and this service may turn to your Edification.</p>

former Generations, for though the Lord was eminently with his people of old, in Moses and Joshuahs time, and the Judges God raised up extraordinarily to be their Saviours, yet in no Age was there a more gracious presence of God then in the Age before Solomon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>As with our Fathers,</hi> that is, see Isa. 63.12,11. Ps.44.3,4. the presence, the Church desires, that had been with their Fathers, or such a presence. 1. In won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working, and as gloriously as for them as in the success David had over all the Enemies of Israel, 1 Chron. 11.9.2 Sam. 8.6,14,15. 2. That presence, or be so with us as with our holy Ancestors, by his gracious communications of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to us in the wayes of his Ordinances, Psal. 63.2. filling us with his glory, even in those signs of his presence as in those best times, ver. 5,6. as David found it when he fet hed the Ark to his place, 2 Sam. 6.12,13.14,15. as to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with, so right knowledge of the things of <hi>G</hi>ods house, and that conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Presence of God there, Isai. 54.13. made David say, Psal. 84.11. one day there was worth a thousand else where. As also in civil order, Ezek. 48.35. was said of them, so might be of us, this may be the Name, <hi>Jehovah Shammah,</hi> the name of our Courts and Churches, be with us as with them in these respects.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In-dwelling presence, such a presence of God in our hearts as was then in theirs, filling us with his Spirit, strengthening unto duty, 2 Cor. 6.18. As God promises those that seperate from the world, 1 Cor, 15.10. Paul he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he had it whence he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> so much work, &amp; in such a manner, Act 14.1. they so spake, many did believe, whence was it that those before us were so powerful, &amp; perswasive, not by excelling in common gifts above many that come after, but having a fuller presence of God, there was a more full pouring forth of the Spirit, Zec. 12.8. that which will make the feeble as David, &amp; David as an Angel of <hi>G</hi>od.</p>
            <p>It may be enquired why it is said, <hi>as with our Fathers?</hi> it seems to be a limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, when as one generation may need more then another, and usually in some respects, a succeeding generation to any special reforming generation, doth: And therefore Elisha, 2 King. 2.9. he asks a double portion of the Spirit of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah, not only to what the other Prophets had, but what Elijah himself had, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meet with harder work, a more sinful and unreformed People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. As,</hi> 1. Imports that kind of presence they had sometimes, the similitude and not the degree, 1 Pet. 1.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not alwayes limit the measure; a great degree of Gods gracious presence is here meant, but not just so much is intended, so much as, and as much more, as the Lord saw good; so much as might carry them as well through their duty, and work, in their generation, as those in theirs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The People of <hi>G</hi>od are wont to gather upon God, by his grants, that is van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage ground to Faith, and Prayer, Exod. 33.13,14,15,17,18. upon every grant Moses gets in with the Lord, and asks yet greater; so it should be here, we shall be in better frame to ask more, when we have obtained so much, and in better hope to prevail.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let him not leave us nor forsake us;</hi> These are only amplifications, and shew the weight of what he did desire, by abiding on it, not leave to others, nor to our selves, not quit the care of his People, Jer. 14.9. that he deprecates on the behalf of the Church, not take away signs of his presence, nor his own presence from them. Solomon his commendable practice is for our imitation. Hence the Doctrine from the words is,</p>

            <p n="2">2. It is the most suitable blessing to the People of God, nothing more pleasing as well as profitable to them, Psal. 4.6. therefore the best blessing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a sufficient good, you cannot desire a more comprehensive blessing, this is enough, Gen. 33.11.

To support assist, and succeed, in every duty, Hag. 1. 14. Math. 28.20. Gen. 39.2. so that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise intimates thus much, as was made to Joshua, and applyed to the use of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Believer, Heb. 13.5. against fears of Enemies, or of want, you cannot want pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for, that have <hi>G</hi>od graciously with you, Psal.144.15.</p>

1. The care of the People of God and the things of God is in a great measure committed to you, as you engage your Authority for the protection and defence of these; so you are with the Lord, and he will be with you and his People by your means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the People of <hi>G</hi>od, these are dear to God, and as the Apple of his Eye, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.8. as he is sensible of the least wrong done to them, so of every kindness and favour shewed to them, you are as the visible covers to these Eyes, their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward defence under God lyes upon you; as it is a special favour to Gods people to have such as fear the Lord over them, so is it an high honour to be over such a People, and the Lord further manifests his kindness to Rulers, when they are spirited and raised up to be Saviours upon Mount Zion; it is both a manifestation of it, and a sign of more, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.5,6,8. when God will make <hi>Jerusalem</hi> a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome stone to all that heave at them, then shall their Rulers be encouraged to stand by them, as being strong in having a people in Covenant with God to stand for, so the God of that Covenant.

               <p n="2">2. Care of the things of <hi>G</hi>od, his worship, that is also incumbent on you as Rulers, defence of, and encouragement in the practice of godliness, and matters of worship: I am far from thinking, Magistrates in New-Testament times, have nothing to do with, either the restraining or encouraging outward acts of men referring to the first Table: The commended Examples in Old-Testament times, that were moral actions are for our Instruction, as well as moral precepts (where those actions were not extraordinary,) As those about the worship of God and religious observation of the Sabbath, that then were under divine Institution as to that time, and mode of Service: There is the same obligation to the care of the Lords day now, and Institutions of Christ in the New-Testament.</p>
               <p>But to wave the dispute of it, what is the duty, is the greatest difficulty, and made the darker, by the various apprehensions of worthy and excellent men. I shall not undertake decision of that Case, but shall endeavour to hold forth so much light for your direction in it, you may be with God, &amp; act in Integrity and Evangelical Perfection: And know you that the Lord will not withdraw because of Infirmities, and weaknesses, where there are not wilful miscarriages of his Servants.</p>

I do not think errors of the mind can be compelled, but by light and Reason, or that any can be forced to be of another mind; they must be drawn, not driven, that heartily close with Christ, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Religion.</p>
               <p>But if any under pretense of Religion will endeavour the subversion of that is true, and so esteemed by those in Authority, such endeavours ought to be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, and powerfully obviated.</p>

and Sobriety. A more exemplary Ministry the world hath not had then <hi>New-England,</hi> and the Lord was with them, let us not come behind them: Men are taught more and readier to learn by example then precept: while you are thus with God, He will not leave not forsake this people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let me leave a few words of advice with this honour'd Court, who have called me to this Service: Honoured Sirs, you have given me the opportunity thus to speak to you, yet my message is from above, I speak to you now under the influence of a greater authority then yours, or any under heaven. Let me hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech and advise you, as those I beleive seek the welfare of this people, to doe your part that the gracious presence of the Lord may be with us as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be couragious for God and his People, our lives and liberties, civil and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, are put into your trust, you may save or destroy us under God; quit you like Christians, and as former Courts; difficulties may be before you, but study more what becomes you at this time, then what will become of you: Enquire what is your duty, and <hi>G</hi>od would have you to do, be sollicitous more to please God then men, nay, assure your selves men you cannot please, the Lord you may, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.7. and though hard and hazardous work is before you, if the Lord set you upon it, he will not leave you in it; <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.4. This is the way to have God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with you, when you trust all with him; make the word of <hi>G</hi>od the Rule of your proceedings, and remember Issues and Events are the Lords, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain to us; but if you be sincere for the glory of <hi>G</hi>od, and in the doing your duty, though in some things you may miss it, God will own you in it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.15. And the Issue will certainly be good to you and us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be unanimous, let your Consultations and results be so as much as may be, the bundle of Arrows is not so easily broken as one, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. what he saith of Church society is true of any of the Assemblies of the People of God, <hi>be at peace and the God of peace will be with you,</hi> and if with you, so far he is with us; union is your strength; your dividing is like an Armies breaking rank when an Enemy is assaulting them. Those that seek the ruine of the whole, first endeavour it by dividing you, shall Herod and Pilate agree against Christ, and shall not Christians for him, and that at a time when there is so general a Conspiracy and consent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Enemies of the Truth, against all the Professors of it? Believe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of each other, take not up prejudices, if you have prejudged their persons, you will make no right Judgement of what they say, press not things wherein there may be different apprehensions, too hard, nor heighten it by giving the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference too ill a Name, or too good, too odious, or glorious; if there be lesser Animosities, and personal, lay them aside, they may not hinder union for publick good, two brave Romans did so. The Agreement of this Court would have an healing influence upon all other Societies under you, your practice of it would speak more then all other desires of it, and do more then all other endeavours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your being with God, will much appear in the Laws you make, to be the Rules of others walking under you, see that none of them be repugnant to the Laws of heaven, or unsuitable to the state of this People; if any be so, better shew your authority in nulling them, then neglect or contempt of them should lessen your authority: What are good, see to it they may be executed: as much of the wisdome of a people is seen in their making laws, so is their authority in the due execution of them, &amp; their holiness <hi>Deu.</hi> 5.8. if you do not make the Laws

               <p n="5">5. Acquaint your selves with the History of the glorious works of God, for this people in former times, those manifestations of Gods presence with our Fathers, &amp; further the knowledge of it among this people: you have been often minded of it, &amp; though something hath been done towards it, by Reverend &amp; worthy persons, yet those providences and experiences of seasonable and wonderful supplyes, &amp; protections, that have been most remarkable, I have not yet seen. The full sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this people to this day would be one of the best of humane Histories, for the time of it, in the world, many things yet may be had from those that have seen those wonderful works, and Fathers should tell it to their Children, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.1,2,3. you are our publick Fathers, tell it then to your Children, the knowledge of this by Solomon was the ground of his wish for the like. It was usual with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in former times that had not the way you have to communicate remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Providences to after Ages, to do it by erecting Monuments, or putting a name upon the place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.14. so to preserve the memory of famous Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.14,15. so Moses by divine direction kept a Record of that victory over <hi>Amale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
