            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>BOTH RICHES AND HONOUR COME OF THEE, AND THOU REIGNEST OVER ALL; AND IN THINE HAND IS POWER AND MIGHT; AND IN THINE HAND IT IS TO MAKE GREAT, AND TO GIVE STRENGTH UNTO ALL.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE GREAT AND BELOVED MAN IS DEAD! <hi>The light of America is extinguiſhed:</hi> and all the enlightened friends of merit are the ſubjects of deep affliction. For though the Saviour of his country "Died in a good old age, full of riches and honour," yet, at this dreadful period, when the world trembles before the horrid ravages of the combined powers of darkneſs, the loſs of WASHINGTON, that able ſtateſman and unrivalled General, is like the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the ſun in his zenith, and matter of great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation. Reſignedly, therefore, to mourn the event be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, "who killeth and maketh alive," and pay our tribute of reſpect to the memory of him whoſe ſame has filled the world and will forever grace the moſt inſtructive page of hiſtory, is the preſent duty of every claſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of men.</p>
            <p>To aid a devout and correſpondent courſe of exerciſes and reflections, at this ſolemn ſeaſon, by illuſtrating THE DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE INFLUENCE IN HUMAN GREATNESS, ſhall be the employment of the ſubſequent diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:038547_0005_1012553EC4FD67A0"/>
THE text and the occaſion we truſt obviouſly meet, and readily harmonize. For, if the Divine Being is the author of Human Greatneſs, we ought gratefully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, and ſubmiſſively hold our peace before the dark diſpenſation of providence. Thoſe, who are qualified to bleſs God for raiſing up Great Men, are equally qualified to adore his name when they are removed. For Chriſtian gratitude and reſignation are inſeparably connected, during our probationary ſtate.</p>
            <p>THAT, God is the author of Human Greatneſs, it is manifeſt, becauſe men as well as worms of the earth, and even the angels of light are creatures, and conſequently dependent on the creator. In every poſſible attitude, mode and ſtate, creatures are abſolutely dependent. Longer than the duration of his dependence, no being can remain a creature. It is impoſſible for the moſt exalted creatures to ſurvive their dependence: Dependence, abſolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on God in all reſpects, is inſeparable from the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of man. For whether wiſe or ſimple they are the workmanſhip of God. Hence the voice of inſpiration: "Both riches and honour come of thee; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all. For promotion cometh neither from the eaſt nor from the weſt nor from the ſouth; But God is Judge, he putteth down one and ſetteth up another. The Lord changeth the times and ſeaſons; he removeth kings and ſetteth up kings; he giveth wiſdom to the wiſe and underſtanding to thoſe that know underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038547_0006_1012554133CB7DB0"/>
The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord and he turneth it whitherſoever he pleaſeth as the rivers of water are turned." Reaſon, philoſophy and inſpiration unitedly conſpire to impreſs the doctrine, that God is the author of Human Greatneſs. For all men, from the womb to the grave, are wholly dependent on God through all the viciſſitudes of life. "The lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſing thereof is of the Lord." Independently of the divine agency we "Cannot make one hair white nor black. For in God we live, and move, and have our being, and in him are all our ways. O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf: it is not in man that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to direct his ſteps." This is a general view of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but juſtice, on this great occaſion, requires a more particular conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> GOD is the author of Human Greatneſs, by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing thoſe who are ordained to move in the moſt elevated ſpheres of action with an anſwerable ſource of genius. The foundation of human greatneſs is laid by the Creator in that depth of genius, which is not the common lot of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral maſs of man. The genius of Cyrus, Newton and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, whoſe fame will keep pace with time, is imparted by the forming hand of God to thoſe whoſe deſtination requires it: and, ſo neceſſary is a rich ſource of genius to attain hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man greatneſs, that no man deſtitute of it can excel. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon abilities, by diligent and painful application, will make a reputable figure by the ſide of great men; but cannot aſcend the ſummit of human greatneſs. Glimmering ſtars
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038547_0007_10125542D35D9888"/>
never ſhine like the ſun. Men, whoſe genius is calculated to conduct them ſafely amid the luminaries of heaven, with great facility reach that height of ſcience, which others cannot by the moſt unwearied induſtry, during the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of human life. All great men command great abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities; and the greateſt manifeſtly command the beſt abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities. Genius is the peculiar foundation on which celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted characters have raiſed their aſtoniſhing ſuperſtructures. This being manifeſt, it is alſo equally manifeſt that God is the author of human greatneſs by the profuſe donation of genius. For who has made the difference between the ſimple man and the great Philoſopher? Who, ſays the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cottager to the man of ſcience, made thy abilities? and who made mine? Has not the ſkilful and ſovereign hand of the creator made the wide difference between us? Let me, then be humble and contented: and be thou thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and underſtanding. For of thoſe, to whom much is given, much will be required. Great men in this world ought to be great in the next. This leads us to add,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> THE agency of God is directly concerned in human greatneſs by amply furniſhing the favoured ſons of genius with an anſwerable education. Unleſs ſeaſonably cultivated the beſt natural abilities will not conſtitute human greatneſs. Deſtitute of education, a man poſſeſſed of the genius of an angel will never excel. The moſt coſtly teints of the eaſt, except diſplayed by a finiſhed pencil, will not approach the perfection of nature: the fineſt piece of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except formed and poliſhed by the unerring hand of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038547_0008_101255454C877D30"/>
the ſculptor, will neither exhibit an elegant monument, nor buſt: and thus that ponderous maſs of genius, which God liberally imparts to ſome of the human race, will forever remain dormant and comparatively uſeleſs, except rouſed, invigorated and directed by education. How many men of genius are there among the rude Africans? How many among the wild ſavages of America? How many among the common people of our acquaintance, who, while deſtitute of generous education, yet diſcover ſome of the prime marks of original genius? The flint is full of fire; but ſome exertion is neceſſary to diſplay the ſparks. Now, we aſk, what raiſed Newton with ſuch celerity from the obſcurity of an awkward, ignorant boy to that immortal height amid the ſpheres? The anſwer is education. What with ſuch rapidity has diſtinguiſhed many writers, ſtates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and generals from their equals both in point of age and genius? Education. The influence of education makes the difference in a great meaſure, which is ſo obvious, between this nation and that, this family and that, and even between this man and the other who, when infants, were nouriſhed together by the ſame breaſt. This in a word, other things equal, is the ground of the vaſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between Legiſlators and Barbarians, the great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and the untutored Indian.</p>
            <p>THIS point granted, that education claims the merit of making the difference between the rude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, the comparatively uſeleſs and uſeful claſs of men, we aſk who is the author of that generous edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038547_0009_10125547EC577890"/>
of which ſome of the human race are the ſubjects? Shall the ſons of ſcience like the <hi>dark Illuminati</hi> of the age bleſs the ſtars, Jupiter or Minerva or Dame Nature or any other vanities of a demoralized heart as the beneficent author of education? The child of modeſty will not venture on ſuch daring ground. For, not to name Deity, the public mind, that reveres revelation, is entitled to ſome reſpect; and pays no ſolemn tribute to the Fates. Are, then, the inſtructors at colleges and ſchools the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive authors of education? Are parents and the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the prime ſource of education? No, my candid audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, God is the author: and our enlightened country, the inſtructors of colleges and ſchools and a thouſand other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which we and our children poſſeſs are but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and means which God improves to expand the minds of men and prepare them for uſefulneſs. God maketh the children of men both wiſe and great. He furniſhes families, ſchools and colleges with the means of inſtruction, and by countleſs meaſures which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely eſcape our notice brings forward the children, the youth and the men whom he has ordained for lamps and pillars of the church and ſtate. His attention to the education of thoſe intended for human greatneſs is marked with the infinitude of his love. The playful child at ſchool little thinks of the high decree of heaven reſpecting his future ſphere of action. Cyrus was choſen, named and gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lord to dry up the river Euphrates, to open the two leaved gates, to break in pieces the gates of braſs, to cut in ſunder the bars of iron and to deſtroy the pride of Babylon. He was therefore educated in the ſchool of
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038547_0010_1012554B3303FB78"/>
arms both in Perſia under the direction of Cambyſes and in Media under the direction of Aſtyages. Daniel was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to bleſs the afflicted, captivated church in a ſtrange land and was accordingly favoured with a princely educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the royal college. Paul was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel that he might be qualified to ſtand before the potentates of the earth and publiſh the reſurrection and the glad tidings of ſalvation. Luther, Calvin and ſeveral others were regiſtered in heaven to introduce the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were therefore furniſhed with anſwerable informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, zeal and fortitude. Their minds, nerves and hearts were formed to face the oppoſition and intrigue of Charles the fifth and Francis the firſt, and to confound the biſhops, legates, cardinals and father of Rome. To ſhake the foundation of the papal throne, and give his people reſt, was the decree of the Almighty, and by his gracious influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuitable agents were raiſed up to execute his purpoſe. It is the Lord who maketh great and giveth ſtrength unto all. He forms the minds of men for the intereſting parts they have to act upon the great theatre of life, and bleſſed be his glorious name. For his wiſdom, power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are infinite. To illuſtrate the divine influence in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man greatneſs, let me obſerve</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That God not only furniſhes men with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and education, but with ample opportunity to exert and improve their abilities. Joſeph, when a blooming youth, was advertiſed of his future greatneſs by ſeveral dreams. But not comprehending his viſions, he like a
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038547_0011_1012554CD100C880"/>
child, in the ſimplicity of his heart diſcloſed them to the family. This, as his ſuſpicious brethren conſtrued his dreams in connexion with the ſplendid coat and the partial fondneſs of old Jacob, was the occaſion of their hating him with all the heart. They, therefore, after a fixed intention to terminate his days, the execution of which was ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prevented, in the moſt unbrotherly and inhuman manner, ſold him to a company of mercileſs ſtrangers, who greedily made merchandiſe of him in Egypt. Thus the rigid hand of adverſity followed the unhappy youth, without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, till he was caſt into priſon. The hiſtory is too af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting for perſons of humanity to purſue, except they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the event. But, why muſt the lovely youth be ſtolen from the dear embraces of his aged father by unnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural brethren, and plunged into the laſting furnace of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction? The anſwer is obvious; that he might ſupply a ſtarving world with bread, and juſtify the ways of God to man. While we, therefore, grieve for the affliction of Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, we cannot but rejoice in the view of his ſuperior great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellency. To eaſe the inſupportable burden of his trembling and afflicted brothers, he therefore wiſely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exculpating the guilty, ſays "For God did ſend me before you to preſerve life." By the peculiar afflictions and trials, which he long experienced, the Lord made him great. Like Chriſt, his great antitype, he was made perfect through ſuffering.</p>
            <p>To emancipate the oppreſſed Hebrews from the rigour of Pharaoh, Moſes the ſervant of God was born with a great
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038547_0012_1012554F49C25638"/>
mind, and educated in a princely ſtyle at the court of Egypt. The ever watchful eye of heaven was upon him from the moment he eſcaped the bloody hand of the executioner, by being concealed among the flags till his education was compleated: For he was the goodly child whoſe face diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played the peculiar features of future greatneſs. As ſoon, therefore, as the period arrived for him to diſcover his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the moſt noble exertions, God led him into the ſchool of affliction. In circumſtances of adverſity Moſes began to exhibit his talents and unfold the great deſign of heaven reſpecting his future dignity. When he termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſtrife between the Hebrew and the Egyptian; when he returned from the burning, emblematic buſh to authenticate his divine legation before Egypt's proud and inflexible king; when amid the plagues and horrors of the land he choſe the affliction of God's people rather than all the honours and emoluments of the world; when he led the reluctant, complaining nation of Iſrael to the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful margin of the dividing ſea; when we behold the man executing his part of the great deliverance, we are dazzled with the ſplendour of his greatneſs: For he ſhines brighteſt in the furnace of affliction. He became great by the difficulties he removed, by the obſtacles he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted and by the trials he endured. He was deſtined by God to diſpel the night, and riſe and ſhine like the opening day. In honour, therefore, to the memory of the righteous, which is precious, when he had finiſhed his courſe, the Lord ſaid to Joſhua, his prime miniſter: "Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes my ſervant is dead." The Eulogy is ſhort but divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038547_0013_10125552C8461E48"/>
ſentimental. More would be ſuperfluous and leſs defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Bleſſed are thoſe who deſerve the approbation of God. Joſhua, that ſpotleſs character alſo became the great and excellent ſtateſman and general in conſequence of being confined by Jehovah to the practical ſchool of war. His peculiar circumſtances in the courſe of events made him the peerleſs general: For upon him devolved the great work of diſpoſſeſſing the heathens, and planting Jacob in the promiſed land.</p>
            <p>THE ſame courſe of providence put the ſword of the Lord into the hand of Gideon, and inveſted him with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man greatneſs. While threſhing wheat at Ophrah to hide it from the ravaging enemy, he was called by the angel of God to be the deliverer of his nation. He obeyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he quitted his work, he marched, he accompliſhed the divine purpoſe, and is enrolled among the great men whoſe peculiar embarraſſments and afflictions gave them op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to expreſs their valour and dignity.</p>
            <p>DAVID, in this connexion, muſt not be paſſed by in ſilence. For the extenſive field of action into which he was called from the ſimple employment of a ſhepherd obviouſly crowned him with human greatneſs. He was born for the day in which he lived, and his abilities were adequate to the arduous taſk reſerved for him by providence; but as gold is proved and purified by fire; ſo David's ſuperior greatneſs was diſplayed in conſequence of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar dangers and evils which he experienced. Though
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038547_0014_1012555535FAC960"/>
no merit can be imputed to his enemies, we cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark that they, under the direction of providence, were the occaſion of his ſuperlative honour both in the field and on the throne.</p>
            <p>WE have previouſly taken notice of the agency of God relative to the education of Daniel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom he formed for the ſubject of human greatneſs. But we have equal liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to obſerve, in this connexion, that the great dangers and calamities, to which Daniel and his captivated friends were expoſed, made them great and diſtinguiſhed characters. From Babel's den of lions and burning furnace the page of inſpiration furniſhes the greateſt and beſt of human cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters. For theſe diſplays of excellency we are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to their enemies, but to the God of heaven.</p>
            <p>WE will mention but one inſtance more. It was the peculiar ſcene of difficulty, affliction, danger and diſtreſs to which the Apoſtles and primitive chriſtians were ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which gave them opportunity to diſtinguiſh themſelves ſo gloriouſly in favour of the cauſe of Chriſt. God gave them abilities and information as their miſſion required, and in the courſe of events gave them full opportunity to diſplay their excellency. By the divine agency, in this manner, all great men have been formed; and aſide from this courſe of operation there have been but few great men on earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> GOD is the author of human greatneſs, by
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:038547_0015_10125556D5915108"/>
directing men to embrace and diligently purſue thoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments which correſpond with their abilities. "Nature, ſays a celebrated author, has thought fit to make a diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her talents among men. She has pitched upon ſome particular perſons, to give them aptitude to perform rightly ſome things which ſhe has not rendered poſſible to others. Nature indeed has made an unequal diſtribution of her bleſſings among her children; yet ſhe has diſinherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted none; and a man diveſted of all kinds of abilities is as great a phenomenon as an univerſal genius." Theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations merit attention; but, as no man can be the ſubject of common information who will not liſten to the voice of inſtruction; ſo, the greateſt genius will not excel, in his proper ſphere of action, unleſs he diligently applies. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhort of well directed attention to his own particular employment will make the child of genius a man of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. He who attempts every thing will accompliſh nothing. It is frequently ſaid that ſome men are born poets, others, muſicians and others, generals. The remark is not groundleſs. But the import is neither more nor leſs than this, that they are the ſubjects of peculiar aptitude of genius for their reſpective ſpheres of employment. For we all know that no man will excel in poetry, muſic or the field of war, who is deſtitute of diligent application. The all attentive providence of God permits none to excel but the diligent. The diligent hand maketh rich; but drowſineſs will clothe a man with rags. In but few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances is the hand of divine agency more conſpicuous, than in directing ſome men whoſe motives will not bear exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038547_0016_10125559850DCED8"/>
to excel in thoſe arts and ſciences which are ſo ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eficial to the world. How many thouſands of bold ſoldiers are there in the bloody field of battle who have no reliſh for the diſcipline of Chriſt? The ſerious and conſoling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is this, that whether men of genius or ſimplicity chooſe or refuſe to be influenced by good motives, God will improve them to magnify his great name. "For he hath made all things for himſelf, yea even the wicked for the day of evil. The wrath of man ſhall praiſe the Lord, and the remainder thereof he will reſtrain."</p>
            <p>BUT, the field opened by the ſubject is too extenſive to be farther explored in this diſcourſe. Let us, however, remark in connexion with the preceding obſervations, that the circumſtances and events which concur in the courſe of providence to conſtitute a great character, are innumerable. As many things are neceſſarily effected by God to furniſh a piece of bread; ſo many more are effected to clothe a man with human greatneſs. Divine agency does not make a great man in a day. God ſpends more time in making a great general or ſtateſman than was ſpent in making the worlds. All the events and circumſtances connected with the infant, the child, the youth and the man, are under the direction of God in order to conſtitute human greatneſs. Hence David, the renowned king of Iſrael, while contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the character of God, who formed him, and qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ified him for great actions and placed him upon the throne, in this moſt devout and humble manner celebrates the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine praiſe: "Both riches and honour come of thee; and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038547_0017_1012555CCDDC8DB0"/>
thou reigneſt over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great and to give ſtrength unto all. But who am I and what is my father's houſe."</p>
            <p>LET us now improve the ſubject by ſeveral inferences and reflections anſwerable to the ſolemnity of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> WE infer the ſovereignty of God in the unequal diſtribution of natural abilities to the children of men. For the inequality among men, in point of genius, is as obvious as any thing in nature. To ſome God gives great natural abilities, to others ſmall ones, and to many others genius of the moderate ſize; and who ſhall complain of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal diſtribution? Has the prince of angels reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that his mind is not equal to the mind of the creator? Shall Newton complain, that he was not made an angel? Shall the leaſt mind of the human race complain of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt? For if all men were generals, the field would be deſtitute of ſoldiers; and if all men were angels, the world would be deſtitute of inhabitants. The infinitude of the divine wiſdom and goodneſs muſt ſilence every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the nature. For God knows beſt what agents to employ, and in what manner to accompliſh his glorious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by the creation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> WE infer the ſovereignty of God in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal diſtribution of the advantages of education. A large proportion of mankind are now in a ſavage ſtate. Many
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038547_0018_1012555F410CF390"/>
others, in conſequence of their ſituation, are almoſt deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the common means of information. Comparatively, the bible and the rudiments of knowledge are in but few hands at the preſent day. But while we lament the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſtate of the generality of men, we ſee ſome of the race favoured with the peculiar advantages of erudition. Why this ſtriking difference between man and man, one nation and another? For all men are equally dependent. Has God made the great Philoſopher and the ignorant ſavage of the mountains? Has he furniſhed the one with the wings of a ſeraph to ſoar amid the ſtars and left the other to roam the foreſt like the leopard? Why this great inequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity amid the offspring of man? For God is as able to make one man the ſubject of human greatneſs as another. But the objection is eaſily invalidated, in the view of every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial and informed mind. For God is light and love; and if variety and contraſt were not neceſſarily connected with the great intereſt of eternity, neither light, nor dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor land, nor water, nor men, nor angels, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature would exiſt. But, who will preſumptuouſly aſſert that creation is deſtitute of value and will in the final iſſue of events tarniſh the honour of the creator? For God has made angels and men and all other objects, and governs them according to the counſel of his own will to anſwer the beſt end. Be ſilent then, O man, and remember, that the difference between the genius and information of one man and another, is the fruit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom and goodneſs. Shall not God do what he will with his own? Is thine eye evil becauſe God is good?
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:038547_0019_10125560DAC4B4F8"/>
Is not the univerſe the property of God? and who ſhall teach the proprietor of all things what improvement to make of his poſſeſſions? Let us adore the Divine Being and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the perfection of his adminiſtrations. For, while God makes the difference between the mind and information of one man and another, his requirements invariably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with the advantages which he confers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> WE infer the peculiar darkneſs of the preſent diſpenſation of providence. For <hi>Waſhington,</hi> the corner ſtone of the American fabric, is removed. The Lord gave him to the nation and the Lord hath taken him away. Had he ſurvived his abilities and uſefulneſs and become a burden to himſelf and friends, the public mind would be very differently affected by his departure. But, he did not out live himſelf. For though he almoſt reached the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon limits of life, yet till death arrived he retained that majeſty of mind and vigour of body which he enjoyed in the active period of man. Like the declining ſun whoſe undiminiſhed orb cheers the world at the cloſe of day, ſo the light of America retained his verticle greatneſs and ſplendour, even at the horiſon of human life. We have therefore, loſt the great ſtateſman, the deep counſellor, the unſhaken patriot, the matchleſs general and the man of ſcience whoſe ſame has filled the world. While other great captains have blazed like the lightening to deſtroy, he like the ſun ſhone to protect and preſerve. Beloved by his country and revered by her enemies, he led our arms to victory and final conqueſt without wading through rivers
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038547_0020_1012556351C51E38"/>
of blood: And never, except at the doleful period of the war, when he commanded the diſcouraged, deſtitute and bleeding army, whoſe influence cheered their ſinking hearts, was <hi>Waſhington's</hi> preſence more needed than at this dark period. The Preſident and Congreſs mourn the termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his counſel and direction and the army laments the loſs of his military arrangements. The States at large preſent diſtinguiſhed tokens of the deepeſt ſorrow in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his death, and we ardently hope that the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence of our enemies, at home and abroad may not teach us in the heat of war to realize our preſent profeſſions. For the trump of war would, if poſſible, rouſe <hi>Waſhington</hi> from his tomb, once more to direct our arms and ſave Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. Though we have confidence in our generals, yet if called to arms we ſhould in caſe of diſcouragement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, greatly need his preſence and military addreſs. We ſtill remember, that during the moſt dangerous period of the late war his perſonal influence effected more than could be effected by Congreſs or the power of the ſtates. But, alas, he has left the field of action! He has dropped his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. His victorious ſword is ſafely ſuſpended as a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar memorial of the conqueror. But let us not injure his aſhes by extravagant tears. Rather let us ſubmiſſively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that the God of armies has diſmiſſed our General from the field; and let us wiſely improve the providence. Let us ſympathize and condole like chriſtians with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and bereaved Lady of our late General. Her afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is great becauſe her loſs is great. She weeps freely, but no earthly friend can conſole her broken heart. Let
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:038547_0021_101229D66EFA8510"/>
us then beg God to viſit her lonely manſion, which is full of ſorrow, with his gracious preſence; and ſend a condoling angel to wipe away her willing tears as they flow from the fountain of grief. Let us mourn with the Preſident; for he has loſt the man who diligently travelled by his ſide through the wide and hazardous field of public life. Let us condole with the American ſoldiers, who have loſt the General whoſe preſence and martial diſpoſitions were the confidence of battle and the preludes of victory and triumph. Let us mourn with our country that her great luminary ſhone no longer. For we need his beams to diſpel the diſmal night in which we are involved. While the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of America will clap their hands and ſtamp with their feet and rejoice with all their heart to hear that <hi>Waſhington</hi> has cloſed his eyes, let us be humble that we need the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. For he was worth ten thouſand other men. In his breaſt, face and deportment there was the influence of an army. Our domeſtic and diſtant enemies have much leſs to fear at preſent from our arms, than before he reſigned the command to the meſſenger of heaven. For he was able to inſpire his country with fortitude, when ready to deſpair. O how did his ſeaſonable addreſſes, in the courſe of the war animate the hearts of the people and add vigour and energy to the authority of the ſtates! In the darkeſt times his wiſdom guided Congreſs and his influence ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the union. Not to derogate from the dignity of others, <hi>Waſhington</hi> was the grand ſpring of the Federal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine. We lately experienced his influence when diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement ſeized our minds in conſequence of the daring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038547_0022_10125565C92BC358"/>
of France. The public mind, when it was judged neceſſary to raiſe an army, was highly agitated, and in a trembling manner began to anticipate the horrors of a French war. The proſpect was gloomy; for the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans in the full enjoyment of liberty were averſe from war. But upon Waſhington's accepting the command of the army, the gloom was diſpelled. Every boſom beat with joy and the public face appeared cheerful, when the Hero expreſſed his readineſs to quit the evening pleaſures of life for the hardſhips and dangers of the field. The event at once created both officers and ſoldiers and organized a reſpectable army; for the proved veterans, whoſe ſtrength was not exhauſted by following him during the late ſucceſsful war, were emulouſly engaged to enjoy his command. The account of Waſhington's being at the head of the army no ſooner reached us, than even the little boys were fired with the martial ſpirit and paraded the ſtreets as though they thirſted for the honour of battle. His ſame, in a word, has made an army of little ſoldiers, who are determined never to ſurvive the liberty of their country. For this token of good we are indebted to the peculiar influence of that military genius who ſtill lives in the riſing, expanding mind of America. But alas the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro is gone! The moſt able and ſucceſsful general in the world lies in the duſt! How are the weapons of war periſhed! Let us mourn; let us be ſkilful in lamentation. For he was conducted into the field and diſmiſſed from it, by the Lord of Hoſts, who directs the armies of heaven and all the inhabitants of the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:038547_0023_1012556915440BC8"/>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> If God is the author of human greatneſs, let us be thankful for Waſhington the diſtinguiſhed inſtrument of his goodneſs to America. Being ordained for the moſt renouned character, God furniſhed him with a great mind and a correſpondent education. Aſide from the teſtimony of many learned characters with whom he was long and intimately connected both in private and public life, his writings and actions exhibit ample evidence that he was a man of great genius and erudition. Theſe neceſſary foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of future greatneſs being laid, God gave him early opportunity to exert his abilities and diſplay his worth. In 1755, he was Colonel of a regiment under General Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock who commanded an army near the Allegany moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, for the purpoſe of repelling the combined force of French and Indians. Braddock was a European officer, an enthuſiaſt for diſcipline; but by no means qualified, as he ſcorned the advantage of fighting behind rocks and trees, to meet an army of ſkulking Indians. Young Waſhington, who was well acquainted with ambuſh fighting, it is ſaid, adviſed him better than to expoſe his army in battle, in open ſight of the ſkulking, inviſible foe of the wilderneſs. But Braddock, who was not afraid to fight Indians at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night with a lanthorn in his hand, ſpurred his horſe and led on his troops. Suddenly, but not unexpectedly to Col. Waſhington, the Indians fired upon the vanguard of the army which immediately fell back in confuſion on the main body and the panic became general. Bold Braddock with the greateſt obſtinacy remained on the ſpot calling to order while his officers were falling thick around, until he had ſeveral horſes ſhot under him. At length he received a ball
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:038547_0024_1012556AB0EC79A0"/>
through his lungs and dropped, and total confuſion enſued. With ſuch bold generals Indians chooſe to fight. Alas for the day. But then, then was the time for the martial foul of <hi>Waſhington</hi> to diſplay itſelf. Then in the midſt of the dying groans of brave men and the horrid ſhout of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age conqueſt God began to raiſe him above other officers. His direct courſe to future greatneſs in the field was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out. For the young colonel took the command and guided the wounded and vanquiſhed troops ſafely through the dangers of the wilderneſs. Till that diſtreſſing ſcene neither he nor his country knew the vaſt reſource of his military genius.</p>
            <p>IN conſequence of making this retreat, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, he was neceſſarily, at the commencement of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, appointed by Congreſs commander of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army. In the ſummer, 1775, he took the command of the undiſciplined troops at Cambridge, but too late to direct and improve the military abilities of Warren and other brave men whoſe memory will ſurvive the marble pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and monuments on which their names are inſcribed.</p>
            <p>THOUGH a minute detail of <hi>Waſhington's</hi> atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the commencement to the termination of the war is not expected from the pulpit, yet the occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a ſummary: for gratitude will retain his doings and ſufferings in favour of his country. The moſt preſſing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity neceſſarily attended his firſt efforts, in conſequence of confronting diſciplined Britains with undiſciplined Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans, whoſe term of ſervice was too ſhort to ſeaſon their
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:038547_0025_1012556D261F1FF0"/>
bodies and form their minds for the field. The General had more to fear from the contracted inliſtments and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of his own army than from the whole force of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy. He requeſted of his country nothing but patience and a permanent army properly ſupplied. "<hi>Furniſh us with men and proviſions, and by the bleſſing of Providence, we ſhall ſecure our liberty,</hi>" was the import of his melting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to the public. But what tongue or pen can fully deſcribe the embarraſſments and obſtacles with which he ſtruggled, in conſequence of not being properly ſupported? His diſtreſſing flight through the Jerſeys in '76, at the head of a handful of diſcouraged men, with elated Britains at his heels, is ſtill freſh in the memory of Americans: for, inſtead of diveſting him of generalſhip, it only rouſed his great mind and prepared him for the ſhout of cardinal vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory which he immediately gained both at Trenton and Princeton. If we recall his military condition in the middle ſtates, where he made the moſt intereſting exertions and was ſubjected to the greateſt afflictions to defend his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, while the balance of victory remained long in a wavering, doubtful ſtate, we are aſtoniſhed at the man: for his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, fortitude and perſeverance all ſhine ſuperlatively bright. Neither of his military talents can be extolled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reſt: for his peculiar aſſemblage of abilities ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the perfection of the ſoldier. In a word, while we follow him both in proſperity and adverſity, through the ſtates, during the war, and remember his extenſive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements from north to ſouth, while the weight of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire reſted on his ſhoulders, we are filled with admiration before the ſtandard of human greatneſs. For, though he
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:038547_0026_101255707329FDF0"/>
had ſacrificed his eaſe and intereſt, and diligently ſpent the moſt valuable period of his days in the midſt of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme labour, hardſhip, ſufferings and dangers of the field to defend his country, yet when his work was done, like a patriot, he declined any pecuniary conſideration. The ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of America was his reward; and inſtead of ſtyling himſelf Emperor of America before he diſbanded his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, diſciplined army, he in a flood of tears, thanked his brave officers and ſoldiers for their faithful ſervice in the cauſe of liberty, dropped his ſword, congratulated his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſtyled himſelf GEORGE WASHINGTON, and returned to Mount Vernon. On his own plantation, at a diſtance from the claſh of arms and the concerns of public life, we behold the <hi>Virginia Farmer.</hi> But the author of great men does not permit long retirement, becauſe they are raiſed up to direct great concerns. Waſhington was, therefore, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſuffrages of the ſtates to the Preſidency of the Union. To gratify a fond nation that hailed him as the Saviour of his country, he accepted the office and preſided as chief magiſtrate, at a dark period, in the moſt dignified manner, till he was tired of the weight of the public, and once more retired. But once more he was recalled from his delightful retirement into the field of war; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was ſummoned from the field of war to reſign his armour, not to the nation, but to the God of armies, and to ſleep in the duſt. The author of his matchleſs greatneſs has long improved him as the grand inſtrument of his mercy to this nation and to the world, and wiſely terminated his career.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:038547_0027_10125572E5E53BA0"/>
WHILE, then, we honour the memory of the <hi>creature,</hi> let us, with all the heart HONOUR THE CREATOR. For God is the author of human greatneſs. Let us alſo look to the Lord for other <hi>Waſhingtons</hi> to fill the cabinet and command the field. If we truſt in the Lord he will be our rock and ſalvation.</p>
