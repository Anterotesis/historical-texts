            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Divine righteouſneſs in the Salvation, <hi>AND</hi> Damnation of Sinners exhibited.</head>
            <p>MR. ROBBINS, has taken for his text Rom. ix. 18. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. And purſuant to his deſign, to vindicate the Divine Sovereignty in the Salvation and damnation of Sinners, he 1ſt propoſes,
<q>To inveſtigate the meaning of GOD's having mercy on whom he will have mercy. 2. The meaning of the counter-part to this, and whom he will he hardeneth. 3. Evince, and illuſtrate this great truth, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to GOD—is his eſſential prerogative, to have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will harden. Then, 4. Anſwer objections. And, 5. Improve the ſubject, by deduction, and application.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Under the firſt head, Mr. Robbins conſiders the latitude in which the word mercy, when applied to GOD, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed in the Bible. And in page, 9, comes to this concluſion,
<q>In the text, particular reference is had to ſaving mercy.</q>
He explains himſelf more fully in page, 13,
<q>They on whom he hath mercy are regenerated, are united to Chriſt, are juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as hath been obſerved, there is a particular refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not to common and promiſcuous; but to ſpecial and ſaving mercy. Conſequently, by the hardened we are to underſtand theſe who are, or ſhall be left in an impenitent unbelieving ſtate to the laſt—to their eternal ruin and deſtruction.</q>
In page, 38, he ſays,
<q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is implied in GOD's having mercy on any, in the ſenſe of the text; and impenitence continued to the laſt is implied in his hardening whom he will.</q>
In page,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026990_0003_0FD2B465A4894580"/>
39, he ſays,
<q>It belongs to GOD—is his eſſential prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative to determine the character, and diſpoſe of the eternal ſtate of men; in holineſs and ſalvation, or in ſin and damnation, according to his own good pleaſure.</q>
From theſe quotations, and others of like import that might be made, it is p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain to me, that when Mr. Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins ſays,
<q>In the text, particular reference is had to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mercy.</q>
He means ſuch mercy as is inſeparably connected with eternal life. And by hardened, to uſe his own words,
<q>We are to underſtand thoſe who are, or ſhall be left in an impenitent unbelieving ſtate to the laſt, to their eternal ruin and deſtruction.</q>
While thoſe on whom he hath mercy, to uſe his own words,
<q>Are regenerated, are united to Chriſt, are juſtified, and ſhall be ſaved.</q>
That the meaning of the text, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Mr. Robbins, is plainly this, I will have mercy, i. e. ſave eternally whom I will, and harden, i. e. damn eternally whom I will. His own words are,
<q>It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to GOD—is his eſſential prerogative, to determine the character, and diſpoſe of the eternal ſtate of men, in holineſs and ſalvation, or in ſin and damnation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own good pleaſure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, if Mr. Robbins is right, the election and reprobation the Apoſtle is arguing about in this chapter, is election by an abſolute decree and purpoſe of GOD to eternal life, with reſpect to ſome men: and reprobation by a like abſolute decree to eternal miſery, with reſpect to others. But, that this is not the meaning of the Apoſtle, in the 9th Chapter to the Romans; is what he had no thought of, as it lay quite wide of his deſign, through this whole Chapter, I think I can eaſily demonſtrate. But as the ſovereignty of GOD, is one thing which Mr. Robbins deſigns, very ſpecially to ſhow by his diſcourſe. I ſhall therefore, reply to him in the method following, viz.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Show what we are to believe concerning the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereignty of GOD.</item>

               <item>3. Show Mr. Robbins totally miſtaken as to what the Apoſtle means by election and reprobation in that Chapter.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:026990_0004_0FD2B4AB45BDF0B0"/>4. Examine Mr. Robbins' five arguments to illuſtrate and prove his doctrine.</item>
               <item>5. Conſider Mr. Robbins' anſwers to objections againſt his doctrine.</item>
               <item>6. Make ſome remarks on Mr. Robbins' improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſubject.</item>
               <item>7. Conclude by a Letter to Mr. Robbins.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Firſt, I am to ſhow what we are to believe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſovereignty of GOD. Now it is very evident, both from reaſon and ſcripture; that Almighty GOD, as the creator and governor of mankind, ſuſtains a double character; as ſovereign benefactor and righteous judge. As creator and ſovereign benefactor, GOD has a right to be, and actually is partial in the diſtribution of his grace. But as governor and judge, he is and ever will be impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in the diſtribution of juſtice. The doctrine of partial grace is held up to view, in Matthew xx. 15. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? And Chap. xxv, 34, 15. For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own ſervants, and delivered unto them his goods: And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his ſeveral ability. Theſe ſcriptures hold forth a partial election, and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reprobation; both flowing from a free, wiſe, and ſovereign grace, which is notoriouſly reſpective of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>By this partial election and reprobation of free grace, I mean, the choice which GOD, as a ſovereign benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, makes or refuſes to make of ſome perſons, church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, cities and nations, to beſtow or withhold favours from them. It is the partiality, with which he imparts his talents, of nature, providence and grace to his creatures; giving five talents to ſome, two to others, and but one to others. This partiality of GOD, diſcovered in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his favours to his creatures, is doubtleſs in perfect wiſdom: but by no rules or methods of proceeding that we are acquainted with. The time when we ſhall exiſt, the country where we ſhall live, our parents, our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of body and turn of mind; theſe and numberleſs
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026990_0005_0FD2B468B167B868"/>
other circumſtances are doubtleſs ordered wiſely; but by rules that lay quite out of our ſight. Plain it is, that, GOD is good and gracious to all men; but it is as plain that he is not equally gracious: For he gives to ſome perſons, families, churches and nations, more power and opportunity to do and receive good, more means of grace, more excellent means, more time to uſe thoſe means, and more energy of the ſpirit in the uſe of them, than he gives to other perſons, famil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, churches and nations. And this great partiality in God, which appears in the beſtowment of his favours, is in no degree cauſed by the works of the creatures; nay, ſo far from this, it, is it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the firſt cauſe of all natural excellencies and evangel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical worthineſs.</p>
            <p>Uncreated Adam, did nothing to merit that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing election, which raiſed him above the firſt Ox: nor did the firſt Ox, do any thing to deſerve to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated from all knowledge of his maker, and everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhut out of the kingdom of heaven.</p>
            <p>The Lark, did nothing to merit her election to tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ring flight and ſprightly ſongs; nor did the poor Oyſter do any thing to deſerve ſuch a reprobation, to be ſhut up between two ſhells, without legs or wings. We may trace the footſteps of an electing or reprobating provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence all the earth over; with reſpect to perſons and places. We ſee one elected to ſway a ſceptre, another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bated to handle a ſpade. We ſee a rich glutton <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to a plentiful fortune, while poor Lazarus, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious reprobate of providence, lays ſtarving at the door of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs plenty. We ſee one elected to enjoy the bleſſing of the five ſenſes, the advantage of a ſtrong conſtitution, and the prerogative of beauty; whilſt another is born blind or deaf, ſickly or deformed; but the poor creature has done nothing to deſerve ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; nor the other to merit ſuch election. But with ſuch apparent partiality does the great Lord of all diſpenſe, not only his providential bleſſings, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his ſpiritual favours: as every one may ſee who takes a view of the ſcripture account of the covenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which GOD made at different times with ſavoured
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026990_0006_0FD2B4ACC2065B38"/>
men, families, churches and nations: peculiar cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants which flowed every one from a peculiar election of grace; by which we may ſee the election and reprobation of partial grace moſt clearly. But GOD Almighty has a throne of juſtice, as well as a throne of grace.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of impartial juſtice, is held forth in ſuch ſcriptures as theſe, Luke, ix. 26, I ſay unto you, that to every one who hath, more ſhall be given: and from him who hath not, even that he hath, ſhall be taken away from him. Rev. iii. 4, Thou haſt a few names even in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments; and they ſhall walk with me in white: for they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Here is held forth an impartial election and an impartial reprobation; both flowing from divine juſtice; which is always irreſpective of perſons. The impartial election and reprobation of juſtice is the righteous choice, which GOD makes or refuſes to make of ſome perſons, churches, cities and nations, to reward them according to his promiſes, or puniſh them according to his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</p>
            <p>St. Paul, has taught us, that GOD will render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well doing—eternal life: but unto them that obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wealth. Rom. ii. 6, 7, 8. The ſame doctrine is taught by the Prophet Iſaiah, Chap. iii. 10, 11; Say ye to the righteous, it ſhall b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſame we have in Ezek. xviii. 30; Therefore I will judge you, O houſe of Iſrael, every one according to his ways, ſaith the Lord GOD: Repent, and turn your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions; ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruin. But this doctrine is taught by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ne more clearly, than by our Lord Jeſus, in his laſt charge, Rev. xxii. 12; Behold I come quickly; and my reward is with one, to give every man according as his works ſhall be. The election of juſtice is then nothing but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality, with which GOD makes choice of his good and faithful ſervants, rather than his wicked and ſlothful

ſervants, to beſtow upon them the temporal and eternal reward of goodneſs and faithfulneſs, according to their works; when he cometh and reckoneth with them, about the talents which his free grace beſtowed upon them. Nor is the reprobation of juſtice any thing, but the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality with which GOD as a righteous judge and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſor of his puniſhments, reprobates from his rewards of grace and glory, his wicked and unfaithful ſervants, who do not uſe, or who vilely abuſe the talents, which his free grace entruſted them with.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide of ſcripture evidently flows in theſe two channels; an election of partial grace, according to which GOD grants or denies original favours as a ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign benefactor; and an election of impartial juſtice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which he beſtows rewards and inflicts pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments as a ſupreme judge. And as from the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, perſonal, partial election of grace, there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a harmleſs, unconditional, perſonal reprobation; as in the caſe of Jacob and Eſau, for while Jacob and the Iſraelites were peculiarly loved, Eſau and the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites were comparatively hated, i. e. while the Iſraelites were greatly favoured, the Edomites were leſs favoured. So likewiſe from the conditional impartial election of juſtice; there follows an impartial reprobation; for when the righteous are rewarded the wicked ſhall be puniſhed; when the judge ſhall ſay to thoſe that have done well, come ye bleſſed, he will ſay to thoſe that have done ill, depart ye curſed.</p>
            <p>Thus although GOD diſpenſes his favours as benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Lord with a partial hand, by rules that lay quite out of our fight; and according to the inſcrutable counſel of his own will: yet his method of dealing with us as lawgiver, governor and judge, is perfectly known, being clearly revealed in the word, namely, that he will render to every man according to his works.<note n="*" place="bottom">If any would wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

diſpenſing, primiary and original favours: and the righteous impartiality and exact juſtice, with which he as law-giver and judge forever rewards and puniſhes; we will try by this key to open the ninth chapter in St. Pauls Epiſtle to the Romans, which was the ſecond thing propoſed to be done, and to which I now come. 2 To give a brief explanation, of the ix chap. to the Rom. It will doubtleſs be allowed that before the coming of Chriſt, the Church, or peculiar kingdom of GOD's grace, was confined to the Jewiſh nation; including only ſuch heathen, as were incorporated among them by becoming Jews and obſerving the whole Law of Moſes. And the Jews firmly believed it would always be ſo. Even the beſt men among them, Chriſt's own diſciples not excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; appear to have no apprehenſion of an alteration in this reſpect. Accordingly when our Lord came, and revealed this myſtery of God, which before was hid, both from Jews and Gentiles; namely, that the Gentiles ſhould be called by the goſpel, and freely admitted into the Church, under the Meſſiah, and upon the ſame terms that the Jews themſelves were admitted; it was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally oppoſed by the Jews. And although GOD's owning the Gentiles; by pouring out the holy ghoſt upon them, in various miraculous gifts, did ſatisfy in good meaſure the chriſtian Jews at Jeruſalem, who were diſguſted at Peter, for treating the firſt uncircumciſed Gentile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, as members of the church of GOD, Acts, xi. 2, 3, And extorted from them this confeſſion, namely, Thou hath GOD alſo to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life, which they believed could not have been granted unto them, without obedience to the law of Moſes. But the unbelieving Jews paid no regard to this, or any other argument in favour of the uncircumciſed Gentiles.</p>
            <p>The notion of admitting them into the church of GOD, only upon faith of Chriſt, they oppoſed and perſecuted every where, with great zeal and bitterneſs. And it ſeems it was not long before good impreſſions wore off, and old prejudices revived, even among the believing Jews.</p>
            <p>Numbers of them very ſtifly, and with much conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026990_0009_0FD2B46B9AC96FE8"/>
endeavoured to perſuade the Gentile converts, that except they were circumciſed after the manner of Moſes, they could not be ſaved, i. e. admitted to the privileges of the kingdom of GOD, and the hope of eternal life, Acts, xv. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>But had the Jewiſh notion prevailed, that no part of mankind could have any ſhare in the bleſſings of GOD's moſt gracious covenant, the pardon of ſin, and the hope of eternal life, but only ſuch as were circumciſed, and brought themſelves under obligations to the law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; the extenſive ſcheme of the goſpel would have been ruined, and the gracious deſign of freeing the church from the embarraſſments of the law of Moſes, would have been defeated.</p>
            <p>The glad tidings of ſalvation by Chriſt, muſt, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been confined to the narrow limits of the Jewiſh peculiarity, and clogged with all the ceremonial obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances belonging to it: but had the goſpel been built upon the foundation of the Jewiſh polity, it muſt have been totally deſtroyed when that was demoliſhed; and ſo the whole peculiar kingdom of GOD in the world would have been overthrown and extinct at the ſame time: and all the light it was calculated to diffuſe throughout the world, would have been quite extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>This was therefore a matter of the greateſt importance to be clearly and fully determined and ſettled, namely, whether the Jewiſh pale ſhould ſtand or not, or whether, the Gentile converts might be trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d as members of the church of GOD without becoming Jews, and obſerving circumciſion and the law of Moſes. And as St. Paul was commiſſioned to preach the goſpel to the Gentiles, it became his duty, to prove, that we Gentiles are the children of GOD, intereſted in his covenant, and all the honours, bleſſings and privileges of his family and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom here upon earth, only by faith in Chriſt, without coming under any obligations to the law of Moſes, as ſuch, which is the main drift and ſubject of this Epiſtle; which the Apoſtle begins, by ſhowing, Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to be equally ſinful and obnoxious to wrath; and therefore, there was no way for the Jews to be continued
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026990_0010_0FD2B4B2B66C8A78"/>
in the kingdom of GOD, but by grace, through faith; and by grace and faith the Gentiles might be admitted into it. But as this would of courſe overthrow the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh peculiarity; ſo likewiſe it would from hence follow, that all thoſe Jews, who do not embrace the faith of the goſpel, are caſt out of the pale of the viſible church, and the kingdom of GOD taken from them.</p>
            <p>Now as nothing could be more diſagreeable to the Jews than this doctrine; they accordingly levelled all their artillery againſt the Gentiles being called, or invited into the church or kingdom of GOD; and laboured every argument to unhinge the believing Gentiles, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them, that they were not duly taken into the church. Therefore, to prove, that the Jews, by rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Chriſt and the goſpel, were themſelves caſt out of the church, conſiſtantly with the truth of GOD's promiſe to Abraham, was a matter of the greateſt moment, to convince and confound the unbelieving Jews, and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Gentile believers.</p>
            <p>And this the Apoſtle ſets himſelf, more eſpecially to do in the ix chap. to the Rom. Which he begins by declaring that it was the truth, that compelled him to the execution of this part of his commiſſion, as Apoſtle of the Gentiles; and not ill-will to his countrymen; in whoſe rejection, he was ſo far from taking pleaſure, that it was a continual grief and ſorrow to him; and the rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſo, he, having had an experimental acquaintance, with the prejudices they were under, with reſpect to Chriſt and the goſpel, ver. 1, 2, 3. In the 4th and 5th ver. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the honours and privileges, which his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the Jews, as the church of GOD had long enjoyed. Then ver. 6, proceeds to anſwer an objection that might he made againſt the rejection of the Jews; notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the infidelity of the greateſt part of them, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the promiſe of GOD to Abraham, Gen. xvii. 7, 8: I will eſtabliſh my covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, for an everlaſting covenant; to be a GOD unto thee, and thy ſeed after thee.</p>
            <p>Now if the Jews were reduced to a level with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that lie out of the church, and excluded from the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026990_0011_0FD2B46D09703E98"/>
common-wealth, to which they once belonged, will it not follow; that GOD hath failed in the performance of his promiſe to Abraham? To this the Apoſtle anſwers ver. 6: That they are not all Iſrael which are of Iſrael, i. e. the Jews are not the whole of the Iſrael of GOD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the promiſe. For Abraham is the father of many nations; and his ſeed is, not only that which is of the law, but that alſo which is of the faith of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Ver. 7, 8, 9, He obſerves they had no right to conclude, that, becauſe they are the natural deſcends <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts of Abraham, therefore they are all of them, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, the children in whom the promiſe is to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. For the promiſe never was confined to natural deſcent, but may be accompliſhed in any part of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams ſeed, as GOD in his ſovereign pleaſure ſhall ſee ſit; as appears from the rejection of Iſhmael and the election of Iſaac.</p>
            <p>And leſt it ſhould be ſaid, that Iſhmael was rejected not by the ſovereign will of GOD, but becauſe he was the ſon of the bond woman, and therefore unworthy to be the peculiar ſeed. Therefore the Apoſtle inſtances in another limitation of the ſeed of Abraham, namely, the twin children of Iſaac by Rebecca, before they were born, or had done either good or evil, that the purpoſe of GOD according to election might ſtand; it was ſaid, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger, Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated. In this caſe it cannot be ſaid, that Eſau was reprobated becauſe profane and wicked, or Jacob loved becauſe he was righteous, for they had not done either good to deſerve, or evil to forfeit the divine favour: See ver. 10, 11, 12, 13.—This plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; that the purpoſe and intention of GOD, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own free choice, is the only rule and ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of beſtowing priminary and original favours: on men and nations; not of works, but the good pleaſure of GOD alone that called Jacob and the Jews to be his peculiar people, while Eſau and his poſterity were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, from the peculiar privileges of the church of GOD. And none may conclude, that GOD's beſtowing religious privileges in ſuch an unequal manner upon thoſe,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026990_0012_0FD2B4B3CF3C92E0"/>
who otherwiſe are in equal circumſtances, is contrary to equity and right; as the Apoſtle obſerves, ver. 14. For ſurely GOD may do what he will with his own.</p>
            <p>GOD did no wrong to man, becauſe he made Angels; no wrong to the mouſe, becauſe he made the elephant: no wrong to the herring becauſe he made the whale, nor any wrong to Eſau, becauſe he gave his brother five talents, when he gave him but two.</p>
            <p>Juſtice is not concerned in beſtowing original favours; but GOD as ſovereign Lord and benefactor, diſpenſes theſe, with the moſt notorious partiality, without any wrong or injuſtice to his creatures. Here let it be noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the inſtances alledged by the Apoſtle, wherein the great Lord of all had diſcovered his ſovereignty, in the choice of perſons to enjoy peculiar privileges, doth not reſpect the perſons themſelves ſo much as their poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And it has no reſpect to the eternal ſtate of either. This will appear plain to any one that looks into the texts in Gen. from whence they are quoted.</p>
            <p>Of Iſhmael 'tis ſaid Gen. xvii. 20: Twelve Princes ſhall he beget, and I will make him a great nation. So of Jacob and Eſau, it was ſaid to Rebecca, Gen. xxv. 23: Two nations are in thy womb, two manner of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be ſeperated from thy bowels, the one people ſhall be ſtronger than the other people, and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger; which ſays the Apoſtle, was ſaid that the purpoſe of GOD according to election might ſtand, ver. 11.12. So that this muſt be an election of people and not of particular perſons, for it never was fact in the perſons themſelves. So likewiſe the next words, Jacob have I loved and Eſau have I hated, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Mal. 1, 2, 3, are manifeſtly to be underſtood of the nations that were to deſcend from theſe perſons, and not the perſons themſelves.</p>
            <p>For ought that appears Eſau had as many talents as Jacob. The words of the text in Mal. are, I loved Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob and hated Eſau, and laid his mountains and heritage waſte for the dragons of the wilderneſs; whereas Edom ſaith, we are impoverſhied, &amp;c. This is evidently ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the people, and ſolely with regard to their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026990_0013_0FD2B46F56150F98"/>
in this world.—Let it be further noted here, that by GOD's ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g the poſterity of Eſau, we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand abſolute <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tred, for they had a good bleſſing; though not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> good a one as the poſterity of Jacob. Yet it is certain GOD loved them, and bleſſed them; and hatred is no more intended, than when our Lord ſays as in Luke xiv. 26: He that hateth not father and mother &amp;c. cannot be my diſciple: where he cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean hatred, unleſs he contradict himſelf—but means what is expreſſed, Mat. x. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>7. He that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me. So GOD's hating Eſau's poſterity and loving Jacobs, means nothing more than this, namely that he beſtowed leſs talents and privileges on the one, than on the other. Such a highly figurative way of ſpeaking, diſtinguiſhes the Hebrew language from all others, that I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with; and which if not attended to, we can never underſtand the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>We ſhould ever remember, that as all creatures are equally related to GOD by creation; ſo they are equally loved by him. And if any creature has a greater ſhare in the Creators love than another, it is wholly owing to the improvement the creature has made of the grace the Creator beſtowed upon it. The Lord loveth the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous, becauſe they do right: And he hateth the wicked becauſe they do wrong.</p>
            <p>We have now conſidered this chapter, to the 15 ver. ſo far as we have gone, the Apoſtle, has conſidered GOD's chooſing or refuſing any body of men in general, without ſuppoſing them to be wicked, or to have forfeited the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour by ſin. But it is evident from the ſcriptural quotations, that from ver. 15 to 23, he conſiders them in quite another light; namely, as corrupt, wicked and deſerving deſtruction; and as ſuch reſpited and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally pardoned, by the pure mercy of GOD, or ruined by his righteous judgments. Which brings his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the very caſe of the Jews.</p>
            <p>In order clearly to underſtand the Apoſtle in theſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes next to be conſidered, it muſt be remembered, that the Apoſtle in the quotations he makes from the Old
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026990_0014_0FD2B4B526F9BCC8"/>
Teſtament; doth not give the whole of the text, but only a hint or reference to the paſſages, to which they belong, directing us to recollect, peruſe the whole paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and there view and judge of the force of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This is evident from the Apoſtles having words in his concluſions ver. 16 and 18, which are not in his arguments; as any one may ſee that reads with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—</p>
            <p>This promiſed we will attend to the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which he proves that GOD is ſovereign, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king forfeited favours from a wicked perſon or people; or in mercy continuing them according to his own good pleaſure. For this he quotes the words of GOD to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, recorded Exod. xxxiii. 19, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion. Now in order to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Apoſtles argument from theſe words quoted by him, we muſt read and conſider well the xxxii and xxxiii chapters of Exodus. And here we find, that while Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was in the mount, receiving the law from God, a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous addreſs is made by the people to Aaron, up, make us GOD's, &amp;c. In conſequence of which, a molten calf is made, and worſhipped by the people. Upon which GOD acquaints Moſes, with the idolatry of the people, expreſſeth his diſpleaſure againſt it, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves of his juſtice to cut them off. Then Moſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an interceſſor; and obtains a reprieve.—And GOD promiſes to go on with his kind intention of giving them the land of Canaan for all this: Yet he threatens to remember this ſin againſt them, when hereafter he ſhould ſee cauſe to puniſh them for their other ſins.</p>
            <p>This, as Mr. Henry obſerves, occaſioned this ſaying among the Jews, that from hence forward no judgment fell upon Iſrael, but there was in it an ounce of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the golden calf. And even now immediately GOD plagued the people, becauſe of this.</p>
            <p>Thus much we find in the xxxii chap. In the xxx<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i chap. we have a further account of the mediation of Moſes between GOD and Iſrael. Moſes had obtained ſee them a promiſe that the covenant w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th Abraham ſhould
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026990_0015_0FD2B473D1AEFE28"/>
be made good, in giving them the land of Canaan; yet they are denied the extraordinary tokens of GOD's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, hitherto enjoyed, and they left to the conduct of Moſes, and the convoy of an Angel. But Moſes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes for the divine preſence, and obtains a promiſe of that alſo, ſee ver. 14, And upon Moſes' requeſting a ſight of the divine glory; GOD ſaid, I will make all my goodneſs paſs before thee, and will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee, and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſhew mercy. As if he had ſaid; my goodneſs is my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and I will make ſuch a diſplay of it before thee, as fully to convince thee, that I am of a kind and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature. But know thou, that I ſpare this ſtiffnecked people, not becauſe either you, who intercede for them, or they themſelves, have any claim upon my favour: but of my own free and ſovereign grace, I chooſe to ſhew them mercy and compaſſion; and not at this time bring that ruin upon them, which their ſin juſtly deſerves. From hence the Apoſtle concludes, as in ver. 16. So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but of GOD that ſheweth mercy, i. e. the making or continuing any body of men the peculiar people of GOD, after they have by ſin forfeited the divine favour, is determined, not by the deſires and wiſhes of men, but by the good pleaſure of GOD alone.</p>
            <p>For Abraham deſired this bleſſing for Iſhmael, and Iſaac for Eſau, but Abraham and Iſaac who willed, and Eſau who run for this mercy of being GOD's peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, GOD of his mere good pleaſure, originally intended firſt for Iſaac, and then for Jacob and his poſterity, and to them it was given. And when, by their apoſtacy, they had forefited this privilege, it was not Moſes' wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor any obligation God was under, but his own ſovereign mercy which continued the enjoyment of it to them. For inſtead of ſhewing the Iſraelites mercy, and continuing to them the peculiar privileges of his church and people, he might have ſignalized his anger, power and juſtice in their deſtruction; as he did in the caſe of Pharaoh and the Egyptians.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:026990_0016_0FD2B4B6933E9320"/>To whoſe caſe the Apoſtle alludes in the 17th ver. And obſerves that although Pharaoh was made to ſtand through ten plagues, yet was treated with much greater ſeverity then the Jews were, whom God conditionally pardoned, and continued to be his peculiar people, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their rebellion. But the firſt good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to make Pharaoh and the Egyptians an illuſtrious example of the divine vengeance is taken. Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that God treats not all ſinners alike, for while with ſome he waits long, on others he brings a ſwift deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; according to his own good pleaſure. From hence the Apoſtle concludes as in v. 18. Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth. By mercy here, the Apoſtle means nothing more, than GOD's reſpiting a wicked people from deſerved ruin, and continuing to them the bleſſings of providence and the enjoyment of viſible Church privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; is too evident to admit of proof. And that by hardeneth, he means nothing elſe, than bringing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ruin upon a wicked perſon or people, is equally plain; as the Apoſtle evidently alludes to the ſtory of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. To this the Apoſtle was aware, the Jews would object as in v. 19. Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath reſiſted his will; i. e. If GOD, according to his own will, thus differently treats criminals, ſparing ſome and bringing ruin upon others: why doth he yet find fault with, and hold guilty thoſe he ſpares? for if it be his will to ſpare them, yet hold them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and liable to puniſhment when ever he pleaſes; they muſt remain guilty, for who hath reſiſted his will? To this the Apoſtle replies v. 20, by ſhewing that its quite unfit for weak and ignorant man, to retort upon GOD his maker.</p>
            <p>In v. 21, the Apoſtle alludes to the parable of the Potter, Jere. xviii. 1. to illuſtrate the ſovereign right that Almighty God has, to exalt one and depreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. To make one more honorable and another leſs honorable, according to his own pleaſure. This premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Apoſtle comes more directly to anſwer the object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the Jew, v. 22. What if GOD willing to ſhew his
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026990_0017_0FD2B4784E549440"/>
wrath, &amp;c. i. e. what can any object againſt GOD's chooſing a time to puniſh the wicked, according to their wickedneſs; when it will moſt redown to his own glory; and ſuſpending their deſtruction till that time comes? For inſtance, in the caſe of the Jews; what wrong is it to them? If GOD deſigning more ſignally to diſplay his vindictive juſtice, and Almighty power, in overthrowing their conſtitution, nation, and temple, that all may ſee, and be ſenſible; that rebellion againſt him was the cauſe of their dreadful overthrow, hath thought fit to forbear them with much patience, even when they were proper ſubjects of puniſhments, and to reſpite the deſtruction they had long deſerved, to ſuch a period, as would effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually do this; as he did in the caſe of Pharaoh and the Egyptians. In the 23d and 24th v. the Apoſtle, ſuggeſts another reaſon why the Jews were ſpared ſo long, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he might diſplay his glorious grace, on thoſe, who before that Judgment was executed on them; were prepared for the honour of being his church and people, in ſtead of the Jewiſh nation, i. e. all Chriſtians whom he had called to the faith and privileges of the goſpel, not only from among the Jews, but alſo from among the Gentiles. For although the Jews were fit for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction long before, they were deſtroyed, yet the fiteſt time to deſtroy them, was, after he had prepared the believing Gentiles unto the glory of being his church and people. The Apoſtle nextly proceeds, by two quotations, from the prophet Hoſea, in the 25th and 26th v. to ſhew that GOD intended to make the Gentiles his people, and declared it by that prophet. Then in, v. 27, 28 and 29. He ſhews by quotations from the prophet Iſaiah, that it is no new thing for GOD to abandon the greateſt part of the Jewiſh nation, when corrupt, and to confine his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to a righteous, believing few. Thus having vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the rejection of the Jews, from viſible Church pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges; and the calling of the Gentiles thereto, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the divine veracity and juſtice; the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, v. 30, 31 and 32, to give the reaſon, why the Jews were caſt off from being GOD's people, and the Gentiles admitted to that privilege. The Jews for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026990_0018_0FD2B4B80F2019D0"/>
the ſcheme of life, publiſhed in the Goſpel, are ſhut out from viſible Church privileges; and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by embracing it are adopted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the family and Church of God. Then v 33, by a quotation from the prophet Iſaiah he ſhews this rejection of the Jews, and the cauſe thereof, as he had ſtated it, was long ago fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
            <p>Thus I have brie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y explained this chapter, about which ſo much difficulty has been made. And I give it as my opinion, there is not a chapter in the Bible more eaſy to underſtand than this, if men would read it without bias, in favour of preconceived opinions.</p>
            <p>But as all depends upon the kind of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation the Apoſtle is arguing about; mentioned v. 11, That the purpoſe of GOD according to election might ſtand, &amp;c. If it be election, by the abſolute decree of GOD, to eternal life; and reprobation, by a like abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute decree, to eternal miſery: Mr. R. is perfectly right. But if it be only election to ſome preſent privileges and external advantages, to be enjoyed in this world; and reprobation, or rejection, as it ſignifies the not being favoured with thoſe privileges and advantages: Mr. R. is wholly wrong, and has totally miſtaken the Apoſtle in this chapter. Wherefore, I come as propoſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To ſhew that Mr. R. is totally miſtaken, as to what the Apoſtle means by election and reprobation in this chapter. And this I ſhall do by the following ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
            <p>ARGUMENT 1. If the ſubject of the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is only ſuch privileges, as were enjoyed by the Iſralites in this world; while they remained the church of GOD: Then the election ſpoke of by the Apoſtle in this chapter, is not abſolute election to eternal life. But, &amp;c.—Ergo.</p>
            <p>The major, is evident from the enumeration the Apoſtle had made of the Iſraelites privileges, v. 4 and 5. Who are Iſraelites, to whom pertains the adoption, &amp;c. And theſe privileges were enjoyed by them in this world, while they were the Church and people of GOD. And it is ſolely with reference to their being ſtripped of theſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026990_0019_0FD2B47DCF4FCCC0"/>
that he vindicates the truth and juſtice of GOD, it the following verſes. Therefore it is not abſolute elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to eternal life that the Apoſtle here treats of.</p>
            <p>ARG. 2. If the election ſpoke of in this chapter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects all Jacob's poſterity, or the whole nation of Iſrael, then it is not abſolute election to eternal life: But, &amp;c.—Ergo—</p>
            <p>That the election ſpoke of in this chapter is rational, is, evident from Gen. xxv. 23. The LORD ſaid unto her, two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people ſhall be ſeparated from thy bowels, and the one people ſhall be ſtronger than the other people, and the elder ſhall ſerve the younger. Theſe are the words which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the purpoſe of GOD according to election. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the election refers to the whole nation of Iſrael. But all the nation of Iſrael were not abſolutely elected to eternal life. Therefore, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>ARG. 3. If to ſerve, which was to be the condition of the elder, in ſcripture, never ſignifies to be eternally damned in the world to come; then the oppoſite bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſtowed upon the younger, could not be eternal ſalvation. But, &amp;c.—Ergo.—</p>
            <p>THAT to ſerve, was to be the condition of the elder, is plain from the text above quoted, namely, Gen. xxv. 23. But this in ſcripture never ſignifies to be eternally damned.—Therefore &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>ARG. 4. If the election the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in this chapter, excludes all works, and is of the mere will of GOD, it is not election to eternal life.</p>
            <p>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</p>
            <p>That the election ſpoke of in this chapter, excludes all works is evident from ver. 11.—That it is not election to eternal life is evident, becauſe eternal life is always in ſcripture ſaid to be of works, though not of works alone.</p>
            <p>The argument therefore is concluſive.—</p>
            <p>ARG. 5. If the election the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in this chapter, took place firſt in Abraham and his ſeed, before his ſeed were born; then in Iſaac and his ſeed before they were born; then in Jacob and his ſeed, before they were born; it is not abſolute election to eternal life.</p>
            <p>—But &amp;c.—Ergo—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:026990_0020_0FD2B4B983EC41D8"/>That the election the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, took place as above, needs no proof.—But the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no where repreſents eternal life, as beſtowed upon any family, or race of men in this manner.</p>
            <p>Therefore &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>ARG. 6. If by veſſels of mercy, the whole body of Jews and Gentiles, who were admitted into the kingdom of GOD under the Goſpel; is intended, and the whole body of unbelieving Jews intended, by the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction: it is not abſolute election to eternal life, that the Apoſtle treats of in this chapter.</p>
            <p>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</p>
            <p>Veſſels of mercy ver. 23 as manifeſtly oppoſed to veſſels of wrath ver. 22. But the veſſels of mercy are, the whole body of Jews and Gentiles, who were called into the kingdom of GOD under the Goſpel, as is evident from ver 24.</p>
            <p>Conſequently, the veſſels of wrath are the whole body of the unbelieving Jews. But men ſhall not be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eternal life, or ſubjected to eternal damnation, at the laſt day, in collective bodies; but according as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, in thoſe bodies, have done well or ill.</p>
            <p>Therefore &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>ARG. 7. If the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, ſpake of in this chapter, ſhall hereafter obtain mercy, and be ſaved; then it cannot be reprobation to eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that the Apoſtle is here arguing about.</p>
            <p>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</p>
            <p>That in this chapter the Apoſtle is arguing about the unbelieving nation or people of Iſrael, and vindicating the truth, and juſtice of GOD, in their rejection; will be allowed by all. But concerning theſe reprobates, he heartly deſired and prayed that they might be ſaved, chap. x 1. Affirms that they had not ſtumbled ſo as to fall finally, chap. xi. 11. That they ſhould all be ſaved, ver. 26. That they was ſtill beloved of GOD, ver. 28. That they ſhould at length obtain mercy ver. 31. &amp;c. &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>Therefore &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>ARG. 8. If the election the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, and is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026990_0021_0FD2B4830CE6D370"/>
arguing about in this chapter, may through unbelief and miſimprovement be rendered totally void and uſeleſs, 'tis not abſolute election to eternal life.</p>
            <p>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</p>
            <p>That the election the Apoſtle is arguing about in this chapter may, be made void is evident from chapter xi. 20, 21, 22. Well, becauſe of unbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by faith; be not highminded but fear. For if GOD ſpare not the natural branches, take heed left he alſo ſpare not thee. Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of GOD: on them which fell ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity; but towards thee goodneſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs: otherwiſe thou alſo ſhall be cut off. Thus evident it is that the election the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of may be made void and come to nothing.</p>
            <p>Therefore &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>I think it now appears moſt plain, that Mr. R. has wholly miſtaken the meaning of the Scriptures, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to predicate his diſcourſe upon. And likewiſe, that what Mr. R. pretends to be the Apoſtles meaning, is ſomething that lay quite wide of the ſubject the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was diſcuſſing, and could not therefore come into his mind. The ground of Mr. R's miſtake is alſo evident, namely, his not conſidering the double character of the Deity; as ſovereign benefactor and righteous judge; as has been briefly conſidered above. Mr. R's founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being now wholly removed, his ſuperſtructure muſt fall to the ground. But as he has advanced ſeveral ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove his opinion, ſo very ill founded upon ſcripture, or reaſon: which may be thought, by the leſs diſcerning, to have ſome weight in them, I ſhall now as propoſed proceed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. To examine Mr. R's arguments, to evince and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate what he calls an, "important doctrine."</p>
            <p>
               <q>ARG. 1. GOD hath an original inalienable right and property in all things. Therefore it belongs to him—is his eſſential prerogative to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will.</q>
Let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered here, that according to Mr. R. eternal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is connected with GOD's having mercy, and eternal
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026990_0022_0FD2B4BB0421FBC0"/>
damnation with his hardening. So that the argument ſtands thus, GOD hath an original inahenable right and property in all things; therefore it belongs to him to ſave whom he will and damn whom he will. The property of GOD in all things will be allowed by all. But ſuch a uſe of it as Mr. R. makes is quite new. Holy Job comforts himſelf with the thought of his being the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of GOD: Job, xiv. 15, Thou wilt have a deſire to the work of thine hands. And the Pſalmiſt grounds his plea for mercy on the property of GOD in him: Pſal. cxix. 94. I am thine, ſave me. But Job and the Pſalmiſt lived before Mr. R. doctrine was known; they ſuppoſed that GOD's tender mercies were over all his works. But Mr. R. has diſcovered, that free wrath makes as large, or much larger part of the divine character than free grace!</p>
            <p>The ground of Mr. R's miſtake is manifeſt, he did not conſider, that ſaving and damning, rewarding and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing, belong not to GOD as ſovereign Lord and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor; but as righteous lawgiver and judge. We al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the premiſes, but deny his concluſion, as totally void of truth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>ARG. 2. Juſtice and mercy are eſſential to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine character, a character complete in all perfection. Therefore it belongs to GOD to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</q>

            <p>
               <q>ARG. 3. GOD actually hath mercy on ſome, and hardneth others. Therefore it belongs to him to have mercy on whom he will and to harden whom he will.</q>
Reply, both premiſes and concluſion are falſe; for GOD never had mercy on any nor hardened any, in Mr. R's ſenſe of having mercy and hardening. And his will is not the rule by which he proceeds, in ſaving and damning

               </gap> under this argument had recourſe to the inſtance of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, to prove that GOD hardneth ſome; I will, for the ſake of ſome who may be impoſed upon, by the bare ſound of words, attend a little to the ſcripture account of this matter. I have already obſerved, that by hardening in Rom. ix. 18. We are to underſtand ruining.</p>
            <p>We will now inquire, what GOD actually did to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, previous to his bringing ruin upon him. It is true, we are told by Mr. R. that GOD hardened his heart; and we read Exod. vii. 3, that GOD ſaid unto Moſes, I will harden Pharaoh's heart. Now if we turn to Exod. viii. 15, we ſhall gain a juſt notion in what manner GOD hardened his heart, for it is there written, But, when Pharaoh ſaw there was reſpite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them, <hi>as the Lord had ſaid.</hi> And again chap. ix. 34, 35, When Pharaoh ſaw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceaſed, he ſinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his ſervants; and the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the people go; <hi>as the Lord had ſpoken by Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD had ſaid, he would harden Pharaoh's heart, and Pharaoh is, in theſe two places, ſaid to harden his own heart; <hi>as the Lord had ſaid.</hi> Therefore what the Lord had ſaid, is to be explained, by what is here ſaid, (chap. ix. 34, 35) concerning the hardening of Pharaoh's heart. But it is here ſaid that Pharaoh wickedly took occaſion, from the reſpite, which GOD granted him, to harden his own heart. Conſequently all that GOD did, towards hardening his heart, was granting him reſpite, from one plague after another; which indeed, ſhould have ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his heart. GOD therefore, hardened his heart, only as what GOD did was by him wickedly made the occaſion of hardening his own heart in diſobedience.</p>

and ſet up his peaceable kingdom in the world. Neither did GOD do any thing to harden Pharaoh's heart, but what ſhould, and would have ſoftened it, had it not been his own fault.</p>
            <p>
               <q>ARG. 4. The potte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hath power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto honor, and another to diſhonor. Therefore it belongs to GOD to have mercy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will.</q>
Reply, I deny the concluſion; for rewarding and puniſhing belong not to creating will and power, but to remunerative juſtice. GOD may without any injuſtice, make one veſſel more honorable than another; give five talents to one and but two to another, according to his own ſovereign pleaſure. But his own pleaſure is not the rule, by which he will proceed, in rewarding and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, but the improvement, or the miſimprovement of the talents freely given to each one, to occupy withal. The parable of the potter, Mr. R. calls an
<q>illuminating proof ſuggeſted by Paul himſelf.</q>
It is true, it was a good proof, and quite applicable to the ſubject St. Paul was upon, in the 9th chap. to the Romans, namely GOD's giving, or refuſing to give, certain privileges in this life. But Mr. R's ſubject, is quite different from the Apoſtles, as it ſolely reſpects the diſtributions of the life to come; a ſubject totally foreign to the Apoſtles in the 9th of Romans. The parable of the potter is, therefore totally miſapplied by Mr. R. and ſo likewiſe the words he has taken from the prophet Iſaiah; and fixed as a motto to his diſcourſe. I am ſorry to ſee the ſcriptures perverted and abuſed in ſuch a manner, by means of men's miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their true meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <q>ARG. 5. Every poſſible hypotheſis reſpecting the determination of the character, and diſpoſal of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate of men, except that which is reſolved into the wiſdom, and good pleaſure of the deity, is weak and inſufficient if not impious and abſurd. Therefore, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to GOD—is his eſſential prerogative to have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will, and to harden whom he will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</q>
Reply, this argument is wholly falſe; both premiſes and concluſion. I will attend upon Mr. R. in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026990_0025_0FD2B4868537F7D0"/>
his fruitleſs endeavour to ſupport it. He begins, by blotting a little more than two pages, in a pretended ſcuffle with men, angels, and devils, for no purpoſe that I can ſee, unleſs, to ſhow how eaſy a victory may be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where there is none to oppoſe.</p>
            <p>In page 34 he ſays,
<q>In the laſt place, ſhall we ſay this great affair is left to men themſelves? Each one is to determine and aſcertain his own character and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate? This indeed is not merely ſuppoſed: but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, as ſtrenouſly inſiſted upon by many. It is not as GOD wills and diſpoſes; but as men themſelves will and order. There are who ſay, men ſhall be bleſt as far as man permits; a nature rational implies the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of being bleſt or wretched as we pleaſe; Heaven wills our happineſs, allows our doom; Heaven but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades, almighty man decrees; man is the maker of immortal fates.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>If this ſuppoſition ſhould fail; I apprehend it will be allowed that every other hypotheſis muſt be given up. Concerning what is now before us, it may be proper to mention ſeveral things and proceed by ſteps.</q>
I will attend to the things which Mr. R. mentions, and the ſteps by which he proceeds; to prove that it is not left to every man to determine his own character and eternal ſtate. And then, prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>Mr. R. proceeds,
<q>It may be granted, that it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Adam (as far as any ſuch thing could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a creature) to determine his own, and the character and ſtate of his poſterity.</q>
And again he ſays,
<q>It may be granted; that in a low qualified ſenſe it was referred to Adam to determine his own, and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter and ſtate of his poſterity, p. 35.</q>
In p. 28 Mr. R. tells us,
<q>That the determination of the character, and diſpoſal of the ſtate and circumſtances of creatures, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the eternal ſtate of men, is GOD's peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and eſſential prerogative. That it belongs to him originally and independently; is what he cannot be diveſted of by any; and indeed is that of which he cannot diveſt himſelf; it being eſſential as abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, involving juſtice and mercy, is eſſential, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026990_0026_0FD2B4C4329EF818"/>
the denial of it, infering the denial of divine exiſtence·</q>
Is it poſſible for Mr. R. to reconcile the 28 and 35 pages, in his diſcourſe? Will theſe ſaving words,
<q>As far as any ſuch thing can be referred to a creature,</q>
or,
<q>In a low qualified ſenſe.</q>
Save him from an open contradiction? eſpecially when according to him, it was granted to Adam, not only to determine his own ſtate, but the ſtate of his poſterity; which if true, does not look as if he had it in a 'low qualified ſenſe.' It is much more than I claim for any other man, or believe that Adam ever had. And how Mr. R. will reconcile ſuch an extenſive grant, to the wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD, I know not.</p>
            <p>Mr. R. ſays, that in a low qualified ſenſe it was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Adam,  and then adds,
<q>And we well know the iſſue of that trial was ſin and ruin.</q>
It is evident now from Mr. R's own acknowledgement; that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicable prerogative of Deity, which Deity cannot diveſt himſelf of, without denying his own exiſtence; was actually ſo transferred to Adam, as that he by the trial, determined his own character, to be that of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and his condition to be ruinous. And as it muſt be cruel in his maker, to give him power only to deſtroy himſelf; and withhold from him power to ſave himſelf; we may fairly conclude, that he had, full and complete power given him, by his maker; to be happy or miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able according as he ſhould chooſe.</p>
            <p>It is very unlucky for Mr. R. that at his firſt ſetting out to diſprove a quotation from Dr. Young, he ſhould by his own acknowledgment, ſo fully prove it. Men ſhall be bleſt as far as man permits; a nature rational implies the power of being bleſt or wretched as we pleaſe. We have now Mr. R's teſtimony to the truth of theſe lines. Great is the truth and will prevail! But we may not leave Mr. R's firſt ſtep yet, there is one thing further, which demands our notice; namely, what Mr. R. ſays of Adam, after allowing, that it was referred to him, to determine his own character, &amp;c. he adds,
<q>It is certain, however, that Adam had not that liberty of indifference, that ſelf determining power, that power of originating volitions, which is urged by many as being eſſential to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026990_0027_0FD2B4884C7C3290"/>
moral agency, and neceſſary to render the volitions and actions of men worthy of praiſe or blame. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch power and liberty is no where to be found, in men, Angels or the Deity; the very notion being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd.</q>
Reply, Who determined Adams will to eat the forbidden fruit? If he did not determine it himſelf he is moſt unjuſtly charged with ſin. If he did determine it himſelf, he had a ſelf determining power. Is it indeed abſurd to ſay, that Deity has a ſelf determining power? I verily thought all who, believe there is a GOD; would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him ſuch a power. For if he be the firſt cauſe, how can his volitions, be determined by any cauſe antecedent or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic to himſelf? and of divine volitions, are not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minmined by an extrinſic cauſe, as they cannot be in the firſt cauſe; then Deity; if he be the firſt cauſe, has a ſelf detering power. And this power GOD has given to me, and every other man; by which I and all other men, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our own volitions, i. e. we ourſelves will, or chooſe, we are agents in chooſing, and not mere paſſive beings. On ſecond thought, Mr. R. may think beſt to allow a ſelf determining power in the Deity. And I do now tell him, that I claim this power for myſelf, in common, with all other men; and ſhall do ſo, until he ſhall prove it an incommunicable attribute in the Deity; and when ever he ſhall do that, I ſhall be quite able to prove, that there is no ſecond being that is an agent. I come now to take notice of Mr. R's ſecond ſtep.</p>
            <p n="2">2.
<q>The work of redemption by CHRIST hath open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way to prevent the deſtruction of the human-kind. But it is ever to be remembered, that the work Chriſt finiſhed on the croſs, in it ſelf conſidered, doth make no alteration in the ſtate of mens minds.</q>
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, it is not reaſonable to think that it ſhould; but when this work, with the deſign and end thereof, came to be publiſhed and made known to men, by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the goſpel; it was reaſonable to believe it would make an alteration in the ſtate of mens minds; and the hiſtory of the acts of the Apoſtles informs us that it did ſo. Mr. R. ſays,
<q>The bias of their minds while unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated is only in favour of ſin.</q>
Reply, by unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026990_0028_0FD2B4C5883E90B0"/>
I ſuppoſe Mr. R. means men in their natural ſtate; and would be underſtood to affirm with regard to all ſuch, that the
<q>bias of their minds is only in favour of ſin.</q>
But what is this, but to ſlander human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Will Mr. R. ſay, that there are in the nature of man principles of ſin? It ſo, they muſt be created in and with our nature by GOD; or the production of ſome evil being, who is in part the author of our nature; which is no other than the Manichean miſtake. How contrary is Mr. R's proportion now under conſideration, to St. Paul's doctrine, Romans ii. 14, 15. For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the thing contained in the law, theſe having not the law, are a law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: which ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conſcience alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one another. Here the Apoſtle ſhows, 1. That thoſe who are without the written law, have a law written in their hearts, which is a ſelf law, or rule of action to them. 2. That this ſelf law, agrees with thoſe things, written in the law of GOD; ſo that men naturally do the things contained in the law. The ſpark of reaſon in man, ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame light, in its narrow ſphere, as the immenſe ocean of intelligence in the father of Lights; the mind of man naturally harmonizing with the mind and will of GOD. The Apoſtle demonſtrates this by three argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1. The virtuous actions of ſome heathen, who have no guide but nature, prove, that by nature they know what is right. 2. The force of conſcience in them, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproaching them, for their wicked actions. 3. Their debates among themſelves, and mutual accuſations, or vindications of their conduct. Mr. R. ſays of natural men, "The bias of their minds is only in favour of ſin." St. Paul ſays they do by nature the things contained in the law. I prefer St. Pauls account of human naure, to Mr R's. Mr. R. adds, certainly it is not in favour of holineſs. "By holineſs I ſuppoſe Mr. R. means obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to GOD's Law. Now, St. Paul ſays, in the text we have been conſidering, that man do by nature the things contained in the law. How then, can Mr. R.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026990_0029_0FD2B494D7F387E0"/>
be certain, that mens minds naturally are not in favour of holineſs? The law is holy, and men do by nature the duties it requires. Why his reaſon for this follows, in theſe words,
<q>For then there would be no need of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born again. And our Saviour did not preach and inculcate the truth when he ſaid, except a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of GOD.</q>
Reply, by being born again, I ſuppoſe Mr. R. means what i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> commonly called converſion, or a means being turned or turning from ſin to holineſs. And if ſo; I would aſk how our Saviour's making this a neceſſary qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for heaven obliges us to believe, that the minds of unconverted men are only in favour of ſin: and certain that they are not in favour of holineſs? He that came to our Lord to be taught the way to eternal life, when directed to keep the commandments, could ſay all theſe have I kept. Jeſus beholding him loved him, Mark x. 17—21. It is true, Chriſt tells him, that he lacked one thing; but ſurely he did not lack every thing.</p>
            <p>I think it very reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the minds of thoſe born in chriſtian countries, and favoured with a religious education; from their youth up, are averſe to the ways of ſin in general, and in favour of holineſs. And yet they may need converſion from ſome one way of ſin in order to their entering into the kingdom of GOD. Mr. R. concludes that,
<q>Were the deciſion, left to men themſelves, as the caſe now ſtands—the conſequence would be no ſalvation: but deſtruction to the whole race: notwithſtanding what Chriſt hath done.</q>
Reply, thoſe who believe this concluſion, muſt neceſſarily look upon all concern about their eternal ſtate; as meddling with what belongs not to them. If Mr. R's ſcheme is right, all inſtrumental religion is but a farce. What can more effectually deſtroy religion, than ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, believed and practiſed upon? But when it is ſeen, that flander and miſrepreſentation, are the grounds on which it ſtands, 'tis hoped that it will not have weight with any.</p>
            <p>We ſee now, that Mr. R. has gained nothing by his ſecond ſtep. His 3d and 4th are ſo interwoven that we will take them together.</p>

The way of recovery and ſalvation by Chriſt being revealed, offers made and calls given to men: ſhould it be conceded, that ſome may poſſibly be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to accept the propoſals of the goſpel; without any ſpecial ſupernatural influence to change their hearts, and captivate them to the obedience of Chriſt: yet it muſt be uncertain, whether any would comply, it might turn out ſo in event, that Chriſt ſhould not ſee his ſeed.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <q>4. This will lay us under a neceſſity of maintaining that GOD (with awe may it be ſpoken) hath projected a vague plan—a plan ſome of the moſt important parts of which are undetermined—a plan full of uncertainty —the event of which himſelf could not know before<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hand;—for if there is no certainty who ſhall, and who ſhall not be ſaved, it cannot be known who ſhall ſhare the ſaving effects of divine mercy. Becauſe the previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous certainty of an event is implied in the knowledge or fore knowledge of the event. For to know that an event ſhall take place, when it is uncertain that it will take place, and may never take place, is a contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in terms.</q>
Reply, If I underſtand Mr. R. here, he means to affirm, that the ſuſpenſion of ſpecial ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural influence, leaves it uncertain, even to GOD; whether any who enjoy the goſpel, would comply with its terms and be ſaved: to ſuppoſe therefore ſuch a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, is the ſame as to ſuppoſe, GOD's plan of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be vague and unſettled, the event of which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could not know beforehand.</p>
            <p>Reply, I will a little examine Mr. R's notion of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural influence, and then enquire how the ſuſpenſion of this ſuppoſed influence, makes it uncertain with GOD whether any among men would comply with the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of the goſpel, and be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I am to examine Mr. R's notion of ſupernatural influence. Now as it is ſupernatural; it muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that does not belong to man's natural compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is above that. Here it may be proper to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the natural ſtate of man, and the powers he has given him by his creator; that we may the more eaſily
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026990_0031_0FD2B4994D13D6E0"/>
diſcern, what he wants of ſupernatural power or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or whether any at all; in order to his doing his duty. By man in his natural ſtate, I mean, man conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered barely as man, and as the kind has been propagated down from Adam to this day; without any thing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added. And the term man, I think conveys an idea of a body fitly organized and formed as our bodies in the general are, and that this body is actuated by a mind, whoſe principle faculties are intelligence and activity. Intelligence, by which it it capable of thinking or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in ideas, of reflecting upon things paſt, preſent, of to come; according as it has received information from abroad, and of looking into the nature and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of things, and ſo forming a judgement of the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or unfitneſs of actions; and a faculty power of ſelf-motion or action, by which it moves and directs the body in that way, and to ſerve ſuch purpoſes, as it intends. And as this is an idea, which I ſuppoſe, is fixed to the term man; and ariſes from the human compoſition; ſo that compoſition is the effect or produce of nature, and not of any ſupernatural influence, which operates above, or contrary to thoſe laws. And as man is thus natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compounded, is he is hereby conſtituted a moral agent, i. e. he by his natural compoſition, has power or is at liberty for the chooſing or refuſing, for the doing or avoiding, either good or evil; and, as ſuch he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for his actions, being capable of approving or diſapproving himſelf to GOD his maker; in the uſe of thoſe talents committed to his truſt.</p>
            <p>Now as man is naturally thus fitted for actions, for what does he need ſupernatural influence? Will any ſay that ſupernatural influence is neceſſary, to enable man to perform the duty which GOD requires of him. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is to reflect, and moſt ſeverely cenſure the wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD, in giving laws to his creatures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is to deſtroy the binding force of the law, and fully juſtify the tranſgreſſor, for no law can bind beyond the ability of thoſe to whom it is given; nor is any man to blame for breaking a law that he cannot keep.</p>

I know ſome are fond of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciating the natural ability in man, and crying up that which is ſupernatural, aſcribing all the good man does to a ſupernatural power. But ſurely they forget that man's natural powers are as truly derived from GOD; as any thing he can receive which is ſupernatural. How then can men think that they give great glory to GOD, by undervaluing the natural abilities of man? When we conſider, that whatever is done, by this ſuppoſed ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural influence; as it is really above man's agency, ſo he has no hand in it; 'tis done by another, and the man not one whit the better, or more deſerving on that account: But like the crow that fed the Prophet, by ſupernatural influence, yet a ſtranger to chriſtian charity, and deſtitute of a goſpel title to its rewards.

               </gap> and agency of another. If it ſhould be urged, that, by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural influence, man does not receive any new abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſtrictly ſpeaking; but he receives a diſpoſition, to make a right uſe of the ability that he has, which diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he would not have, without a divine ſupernatural influence; but would be diſpoſed to the contrary. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the ſtrength of this objection lies in the improper uſe of the word diſpoſition; and in order to remove it I would obſerve, that we have before ſhown, that intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and activity are neceſſary to conſtitute a moral agent. And as motive, which takes place in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and which is the product of intelligence, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> neceſſary to action, becauſe the active faculty will not be exerted, without ſome previous reaſon to diſpoſe the mind to action: hence it appears, that, when a man is ſaid to be diſpoſed, to one action rather than another, nothing is intended thereby but the prevaling influence, that one motive has upon a man to produce action, above what all others have to produce the contrary. For a motive is the ground and reaſon of action, ſo the motive that prevails diſpoſes the agent to act. And every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive is what it is in its ſelf, either good or evil, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to, and independent of any divine determination concerning them. When therefore, it is ſaid that man
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026990_0034_0FD2B4D3C4AC1F08"/>
cannot make a right uſe of his ability, except GOD by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſupernatural influence gives him a diſpoſition; the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erm diſpoſition, muſt ſignify either, 1 The giving a power to diſtinguiſh betwixt one motive and another, and ſo to judge of their moral fitneſs or unfitneſs; or a A power to act from right motives, when ſuch are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the mind: or 3 The preſenting ſuch motives to the mind, as are neceſſary to excite to right action.</p>
            <p>Now if by a diſpoſition is meant either of the two firſt, it is falſe to ſay, that man would not have a diſpoſition to make a right uſe of the ability he has without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural influence, becauſe what is here ſuppoſed to be given by ſupernatural influence, is what man has by his natural compoſition; and that by which he is conſtituted a moral agent, as I have ſhown above. Take away theſe powers or either of them, and men are no more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of moral government, or accountable for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than the beaſts of the field. But if by giving a diſpoſition is meant the preſenting ſuch motives to the mind, as are neceſſary to excite to right action, and that ſuch action cannot take place, except thoſe motives are thus preſented. Then I anſwer, it is true that a good and virtuous action cannot take place without a proper motive to excite to it, and that GOD may, and I believe often does, kindly interpoſe, and by his holy ſpirit, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proper motives to the mind, which motives ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, become the ground and reaſon of good action of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times. But then it is to be remembered,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That ſuch an interpoſition, of the father of ſpirits to aſſiſt our minds, is not, always neceſſary to right action, becauſe the fitneſs or unfitneſs of our actions in general, is plain to be ſeen, without ſuch help.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When GOD does at any time interpoſe and by his holy ſpirit preſent motives to the mind, this divine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, is not the phyſical, nor the moral cauſe of the right action that follows. For as the fitneſs of the action ariſes from the nature of things; ſo our ſeeing that fitneſs, and acting agreeable to it, is no other than the exerciſe of that ability, which ariſes from our natural compoſition; and all that GOD does is only inſtrumentally making that

motive preſent to the mind, which is the excitement t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſome other way, and if it had, it would have produced the ſame action. So that, ſtrictly ſpeaking GOD never gives any diſpoſition at all but 'tis wholly by the exerciſe of men's natural powers that they are diſpoſed this way or that.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, ſhould any ſay, that though man, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his natural capacity, is an agent, yet his agency is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to things natural and rational; but as to things ſpiritual, he has no agency, until by a ſupernatural influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he is put into a capacity therefor. This I ſuppoſe is Mr. R's real ſentiment, if I can underſtand him; and in ſeveral parts of his diſcourſe, more or leſs clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>See p. 18 and 19,
<q>In regeneration and ſanctification the ſcriptures aſcribe a peculiar interpoſition and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God.—According to ſcriptural repreſentation there ſeemeth to be a peculiar, and what hath been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſupernatural influence, in producing holy pecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and volitions, which influence is over and above the general influence—extrinſic exertion, neceſſary to prepare the way for perceptions and volitions, to take place in creatures, i. e. to enable them to underſtand and chooſe.—Sinful exerciſes may be conceived of as taking place, without any other kind of influence—ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſic exertion, than what is neceſſary to enable men to underſtand chooſe and act.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If I underſtand Mr. R. he means to hold forth, that over and above that general influence of GOD, by which all men are able to underſtand, chooſe and act; there is a ſpecial, peculiar, ſupernatural influence neceſſary, in order to men's converting from ſin, or becoming holy. By a general influence men can underſtand chooſe and act; as Mr. R. tells us; but they can only underſtand, chooſe and act in the common affairs of life. He doth not mean to extend this power, to religious, holy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for with regard to theſe he tells us, that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural influence is neceſſary to produce them. So that I think it is plain, that Mr. R. conſiders the agency of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026990_0036_0FD2B4D3C8036058"/>
a natural man to be confined, to things rational and nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural; but as to ſpiritual things men have no agency, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til by a ſupernatural influence they are put into a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty therefor. To this, I ſhall in this place, only ſay, that if Mr. R. and others of his opinion are right, there muſt be two ſets of powers in man, for the performance of good, one for temporal and the other for ſpiritual good. But, to me, this appears a mere fiction, both reaſon and ſcripture agree, that it is by one ſet of powers, namely, the human compoſition, that we perform all good, whether it relates to this life or a better, and by which we pleaſe either man or GOD. The ſame tongue with which we bleſs GOD, we curſe men, out of the ſame mouth proceedeth bleſſing and curſing, James iii. 9, 10. It is by the ſame paſſion of fear, that men are lead to guard againſt the evils of this life, and of another.</p>
            <p>It is the ſame natural paſſion of hope, which excites men to proſecute there preſent and future happineſs. It is by the ſame natural power, that a man loves GOD and his neighbour; which is the fulfilling of the law, and which will render him acceptable to his maker, and by which he loves any thing, that renders this life agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him. Only the affection is exerciſed on differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> objects, and to a different degree, and it becomes either virtuous or vicious as it is exerciſed upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or an improper object; or as it is kept within, or is indulged beyond its due bounds. It is the ſame nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural active faculty, or power of ſelf-motion, by which a man uſes the members of his body, to commit murder or to ſave from death. The caſe is the ſame with regard to all the parts of our compoſition, and with regard to all the good which is performed by us.</p>
            <p>And I do hereby call upon Mr. R. to give a caſe, in which it will appear, that the natural man, has not abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to perform any one branch of goodneſs, that will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him acceptable to his maker. Our underſtandings may be enlightened, by truths brought to their view by the holy ſpirit of GOD; which otherwiſe they might have remained ignorant of, or might not have attended to, and truth thus preſented, may become the ground or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026990_0037_0FD2B4A4E748EA50"/>
of action. And if Mr. R. chooſes to call this by the name of ſupernatural influence, I will not contend about words. Yet let it be remembered, that this does not in the leaſt affect our liberty, nor give us any new agency. But man is juſt the ſame nature he was before, in that reſpect: his actions are performed in the ſame way, by the ſame natural faculties of intelligence and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, as they were, antecedent to that illumination. How different ſoever the ways are, by which man's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding receives information, the faculty remains the ſame, being no more than a natural faculty. And if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion follows a judgement, made up by means of truth ſuggeſted by the holy ſpirit; that action is performed by men's natural faculty or power of ſelf motion, exerted and directed by his intellectual faculty.</p>
            <p>Thus I have a little examined Mr. R's. notion of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural influence, and to it appears a mere fiction: As it muſt, I think be evident to every diſcerning perſon, that it is by man's natural agency, he performs all the actions which are performed by him. And if he is ever, by another made an inſtrument, in matters wherein he has no agency, or that are above his agency, he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly nothing the better for that; there being nothing of the nature of virtue in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I come as propoſed to enquire, how the ſuſpenſion of this ſuppoſed ſupernatural influence, makes it uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with God, whether any among men would comply with the propoſals of the goſpel and be ſaved. Were it uncertain only with men, there would be no inconven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in it; as it would be equally uncertain, whether any one would fail of a compliance and ſalvation. But if it be as Mr. R. ſays, an event which God himſelf could not know beforehand; God's plan is vague and uncertain.</p>
            <p>Mr. R. tells us p. 37.
<q>It is no limitation of divine knowledge to ſay, GOD cannot know that which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowable.</q>
But how does it appear, that, it is a thing unknowable how men under the goſpel will chooſe and act, without ſupernatural influence to aſſiſt them? Mr. R. has offered no evidence of this, only ſaying,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026990_0038_0FD2B4D551273088"/>
"It muſt be uncertain," which is far from being ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to me. Is it not true, that the knowledge of the Deity is uncreated, underived, ſelf exiſting, independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant of any cauſe or medium whatever; eſſential to the very exiſtence of Deity, and neceſſarily implied in the very idea of GOD; who by one ſimple eternal act of his underſtanding, knows all things that have been, that are, that ever will be, and that never will be.</p>
            <p>It is evident to me, that Mr. R. ſuppoſes that GOD cannot know things properly contingent, that may or may not be, for ought that he hath decreed about them. Such as the choice, and actions of voluntary agents. And this falſe notion has doubtleſs miſled him. If the above definition of the divine knowledge is juſt; his miſtake is thereby detected. But as this is a matter of the greateſt importance, I will take it up a little more largely. And the contingency of ſome events in reſpect of GOD, may be proved thus; GOD hath decreed, that all his creaturs ſhould ordinarily work according to their ſeveral kinds and endowments, by which he in the creation diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. For illuſtration, they may be ranked into three ſeveral forms. In the loweſt ſtand the mere natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, inanimate and ſenſeleſs creatures. To theſe God hath given certain inſtincts and inclinations, by which they are determinately ſwayed to theſe or thoſe certain ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and operations, unleſs they are outwardly hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for heavy bodies cannot chooſe but defend, fire can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but burne.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond ſtand the ſenſitive creatures, beaſts, ſowls, fiſhes, &amp;c. to theſe GOD hath given ſenſe and knowledge to diſcern what is good for their nature, and what is bad; and among many goods, to prefer that which is beſt, he hath given them alſo a free appetite, or a kind of ſenſitive will, by which they may either freely proſecute, or avoid, ſuch objects as they like or diſlike; not determinately tied to this or that operation, as the other were. A ſtone cannot but deſcend, but a beaſt may as well go up hill as down. In the upper form are men, reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whom GOD hath made more voluntary than the other, by giving them greater freedom of choice, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026990_0039_0FD2B4A4EB936928"/>
unto their more elevated knowledge, a greater variety of objects. Now, without doubt, GOD has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed his creatures in abilities and faculties, that they might operate in their ſeveral kinds; that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents might work naturally, the voluntary, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily. The truth of this I think no man will deny ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly; but ſee the conſequence which follows moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably.</p>
            <p>If GOD hath decreed, that many things ſhould be done voluntarily by his creatures; then hath he decreed that many things ſhould be done contingently in reſpect of him: but the firſt is granted, therefore the ſecond muſt. The connexion I prove thus. All things are done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingently in reſpect of GOD, which for ought he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, might with as much poſſibility not be as be. But all things which are done by the creatures voluntarily, may as well not be done as done: therefore, if he hath decreed, that many things ſhall be done voluntarily, he hath alſo decreed, that they ſhould be done contingently. The minor is evident; becauſe if the creatures may not as well omit them as do them, they do them not voluntarily, but neceſſarily. Hence we ſee, that contingency is neceſſary in reſpect of GOD's will, who will have many things done voluntarily; otherwiſe he would never have given his creatures wills. Now to ſay, that GOD cannot know things that are contingent, that may be, or may not be, according to the will of the creature; is the ſame as to ſay, that GOD's knowledge is but finite. For infinity of Knowledge muſt reſpect either the number of objects, or the manner of comprehending them. But as no number can be infinite, ſince it may be doubled and trebled: knowledge in this reſpect can be but finite. But when we believe, that GOD from eternity decreed that volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary agents ſhould have liberty to do, or not to do, and after what manner they pleaſed; ſo that for any neceſſity impoſed upon their actions by him, whatſoever they omit was as poſſible to be done, as what they did — And yet from eternity knowing whatſoever his creatures would do, or not do, his knowledge muſt be infinite, and moſt admirable. Infinite, not in reſpect of the number of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026990_0040_0FD2B4D6D6EC5CC8"/>
for ſo no knowledge can be: but in reſpect of the boundleſs manner of actual comprehending thoſe things with an infallible fore-ſight, which in reſpect of GOD were contingent, their not being as poſſible as their being. This is the royal prerogative of divine knowledge: and hence in the 41ſt of Iſaiah, GOD upbraideth the Pagan deities with this privilege peculiar to himſelf.—From what has been obſerved, is it not apparent, that there is no previous or antecedent certainty in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, upon which the divine preſcience is founded.— This ſhows us the weakneſs and fallacy of Mr. R's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, when he ſays, as in p. 37,
<q>If there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty who ſhall, and who ſhall not be ſaved, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known who ſhall ſhare the ſaving effects of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine mercy, becauſe the previous certainty of an event, is imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed in the knowledge, or fore knowledge of the event.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By certainty here, Mr. R. muſt mean ſome medium diſtinct from the event, and by which it is made known. But had Mr. R. conſidered, that the knowledge of the Deity is an eſſential attribute; independent of his decree, or any other act of his own, much leſs the actions of any finite or created being, he would never have reaſoned thus. I would aſk Mr. R. how the Saviour knew, that Sodom would have remained to his day, if the mighty works had been done in it, which were done in Capernaum? Will he ſay, the event was certain previous to its being known! It is very evident to me, that Mr. R. does not conſider the difference between the knowledge of Deity, and our knowledge. It is readily granted, that ſuch finite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect creatures as we are, cannot poſſibly know that any future event will certainly take place, unleſs it be neceſſarily connected with ſomething that has a preſent exiſtence; for all we know, muſt either be ſelf evident, or evident by proof, i. e. It muſt be connected with ſome cauſe or medium known to us at preſent, from which we can with certainty infer its future exiſtance. Our knowledge is thus limited and confined, becauſe wholly <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b extra.</hi> We having no innate ſtock of knowledge. But if Deity cannot know things, but only in this way,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026990_0041_0FD2B4A6CC626130"/>
how came he by the idea of poſſible exiſtence? Upon the whole it now fully appears, that Mr. R. is greatly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, in ſaying, "GOD could not know what would be the event of things in the ſyſtem." Upon the ſuſpenſion of ſupernatural influence. All therefore, that he infers from hence about the plan of GOD, as vague and full of uncertainty, is without the leaſt foundation. Thus I have followed Mr. R. four ſteps, without geting any near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the point he ſet out for.</p>
            <p>His 5th and 6th ſteps, have not ſo much as the ſhadow of an argument in them, being wholly recapitulatory, and anticipating a concluſion, from premiſes that are doubtful, not to ſay openly falſe. His 7th ſtep is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced thus, p. 38.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <q>7. This dilemma is unavoidable. Either the Deity hath no will, no pleaſure reſpecting the ſalvation, and damnation of the individuals of the human race, or his counſel doth not ſtand; unleſs it be true that he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and hardeneth whom he will, as fully and definitively as hath been mentioned.</q>
Reply, GOD hath a will and pleaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the ſalvation and damnation of men, and has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and publiſhed it in his word; namely, that the righteous ſhall be rewarded, and the wicked puniſhed: for he will render to every man according to his works. Which revelation, of GOD, is openly contrary to the ſentiment advanced by you, and if true yours muſt be falſe. Now Sir, what becomes of your <hi>Crocodilinus</hi>? But it ſeems you were aware of the weakneſs of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma; for a little below you ſay,
<q>And for any to urge, that the divine will is conditional. There is nothing definititvely fixed in the divine mind reſpecting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals that ſhall be ſaved, or that ſhall periſh, only this in general: He is reſolved to have mercy on all that repent, and to harden and deſtroy all thoſe who remain impenitent. And this being the ſum of his will and counſel: he not only hath a will in the matter; but his counſel muſt ſtand, let it fall as it may with the individuals of the human race. I ſay to urge this, will afford no relief.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:026990_0042_0FD2B4D84A1D89E0"/>But pray why doth it not afford relief? Why doth it not deſtroy your dilemma? You have a pretended rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ready, we will attend to it.
<q>Becauſe repentance is implied in GOD's having mercy on any in the ſenſe of the text.</q>
Reply, Unhappy for you Sir, that you had not known the meaning of your text, before you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to preach from it; and I fear it may be ſo to ſome of your readers. But as I have fully proved, that the text has no ſuch meaning as you give it; that it was what could never come into St. Paul's mind when he wrote it; as it lay quite wide of his ſubject: you muſt look up ſome better reaſon in future, or people will think that the divine will may be conditional. Thus we have followed Mr. R. ſeven ſteps, and are quite as far from the point, as when we ſet out. His eighth and laſt ſtep followeth.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <q>8. Therefore on the whole, ſince a denial that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to GOD — is his eſſential prerogative, to have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and to harden whom he will; is ſo full of weakneſs and abſurdity. Since there are no other beings to whom it doth or can belong. And ſince the admiſſion of this ſets GOD up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throne; ſubjecting the materals of the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al world, to his authority and will. And in fine leads us to ſee how his own, which are the wiſeſt and beſt ends, may be certainly and infallibly accompliſhed. We ought to be eſtabliſhed in a clear conviction, and full perſuaſion of this great truth: that it belongs to GOD, is his eſſential prerogative, to determine the character, and diſpoſe of the eternal ſtate of men; in holineſs, and ſalvation; or in ſin and damnation according to his own good pleaſure.</q>
As here is no argument of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, I ſhall reply by only ſaying. Therefore on the whole, ſince we ſee a gentleman of fine learning, of good diſcerning, of mature age and judgement, devoted to ſtudy and find out truth, and diſcover it for the benefit of others; and under the beſt advantages ſo to do: ſo compleatly baffled, in his endeavours to prove, that it does not belong to men, to determine their own ſtate and condition in the world to come. We ought to be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026990_0043_0FD2B4A8516EE018"/>
in a clear conviction, and full perſuaſion, that this good Gentleman did really undertake a forlorn hope. And have our minds prepared to receive evidence to the contrary to which I ſhall now proceed as propoſed. I have attended Mr. R. in his ſtruggle, to prove that it does not belong to men, to determine their own charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſtate in the world to come; and find him whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly failing. But this is not to be wondered a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ſince what he undertook to prove is againſt both reaſon and ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and renders them both wholly uſeleſs unto men as bound for eternity.</p>
            <p>I will now undertake to prove the contrary; a taſk I ſhould not have thought of undertaking, had not Mr. R. denied it. But I am apprehenſive of no difficulty, but what will ariſe to me, from the propoſitions being to near a kin to a ſelf-evident one; that it may be difficult to find proof clearer than the thing to be proved. However I will try with Mr. R. help to ſet this matter beyond diſpute. I am greatly obliged to Mr. R. for ſaving me the trouble, of an enquiry into the liberties and privileges of the firſt man; by freely acknowledging, that what he calls an eſſential prerogative of Deity; and what Deity could not diveſt himſelf of, was actually transfered to him; and that in a more full, ample and extenſive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than I could deſire.</p>
            <p>Now that it does belong to men themſelves to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their own character and eternal ſtate; I offer the following arguments as proof.</p>
            <p>ARGUMENT 1. If the divine favour and acceptance depends wholly upon what men do: It belongs to them to determine their own character and eternal ſtate. But the divine favour and acceptance depends wholly on what men do—Ergo—</p>
            <p>Mr. R. has made it unneceſſary for me to ſay any thing about the firſt man; but if we may receive for truth what Moſes has related, concerning GOD's treatment of the ſecond man, my argument is fully eſtabliſhed, from one ſingle text of ſcripture; namely, that in Gen. iv. 7, If thou doeſt well, ſhall thou not be accepted? and if thou doeſt not well, ſin lieth at the door. The context tells
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026990_0044_0FD2B4DC39890CB8"/>
us that Cain and Abel brought their offerings—That GOD had reſpect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain, and to his offering he had no reſpect. This made Cain very angry, and his countenance fell, upon this therefore Almighty GOD condeſcends to reaſon with him as in the text.—Here the great GOD lays down the rule of judgment, that rule by which he would proceed in diſtributing rewards and puniſhments to men. And it is done in ſuch a way as to ſhow that Cain was fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this before, and knew well the terms of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with GOD; for it is put by way of queſtion, which is a pointed way of ſpeaking, and ſuppoſe the caſe to be quite plain. <hi>If thou doeſt well,</hi> i. e. If thou had'ſt brought ſuch an offering, as thy circumſtances enabled thee, and as might be juſtly expected from thee; and with ſuch a temper of mind, as thou mighteſt and ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to have done, and as thy brother did. <hi>Shouldeſt thou not be accepted?</hi> Yes, ſurely, it would have been wrong, unjuſt and unequal in me to have rejected thee and thy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; and this thou doeſt fully know. <hi>And if thou doeſt not well,</hi> i. e. doeſt evil, when thou hadeſt power and waſt at liberty to do the contrary, <hi>Sin lieth at the door.</hi> Thou oughteſt in all reaſon to expect to reap the fruit of thy folly and wickedneſs; thy reſentment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is moſt unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>I aſk now, why Almighty GOD made this difference between theſe two brothers and their offerings? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer muſt be, becauſe one did well and the other ill. I therefore ſay, if we may receive for truth what Moſes has here related, it is certain that it did belong to Cain and Abel, to determine their own character and eternal ſtate. And conſequently to the whole poſterity of Adam, to the end of the world. The divine favour depending wholly on the improvement men make of the talents committed to their truſt; it belongs ſolely to them to determine their eternal ſtate.</p>
            <p>ARG. 2. If GOD ſets life and death before men, and leaves it to them to chooſe either: it belongs to men to determine their own character and future ſtate.</p>
            <p>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:026990_0045_0FD2B4A9C53538B0"/>If we may credit the writings called ſacred, this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be fully ſupported from many paſſages in them; particularly Deut. xxx. 15, 16, See I have ſet before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; in that I command thee this day to love the Lord thy GOD, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his ſtatutes, and his judgments, that thou mayeſt live. Verſe 19, I call heaven and earth to record this day againſt you that I have ſet before you life and death, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and curſing: therefore chooſe life that both thou and thy ſeed may live.</p>
            <p>ARG. 3. If GOD promiſes life to the righteous, and threateneth death to the wicked: it belongs to men to determine their own character and future ſtate.</p>
            <p>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</p>
            <p>The ſacred writings are full of promiſes to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and threatenings to the wicked. One inſtance may ſuffice. See Iſa. iii. 10, Say ye to the righteous it ſhall be well with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings; v. 11, Woe unto the wicked; it ſhall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands ſhall be given him. But none can be righteous but by doing right, or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by doing wrong. 1 John. iii. 7, He that doeth righteouſneſs is righteous. It is men themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that determine their own character and eternal ſtate; and none other can do it for them.</p>
            <p>ARG. 4. If GOD requires obedience of men, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his favour and eternal happineſs, it belongs to men to determine their own character and eternal ſtate.</p>
            <p>But &amp;c.—</p>
            <p>The ſacred writings aſſure us that GOD does require obedience of men in order to happineſs. Acts xvii. 3. GOD now commandeth all men every where to repent. Rom. ii. 6, 7, 8, GOD will render to every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deeds: to them, who, by patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in well doing, eternal life; but unto them that do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wrath. Therefore it belongs to men to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their own character and eternal ſtate.</p>
            <p>ARG. 5. If men will be finally juſtified, or condemned
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026990_0046_0FD2B4E1A3F3EF08"/>
by their works, it belongs to men to determine their own character and eternal ſtate.</p>
            <p>But &amp;c.—Ergo—</p>
            <p>If the draught and ſcheme our Lord has given of the judgment of the great day, in Mat. xxv. 31—46 may be relied upon for truth my argument is fully ſupported. I have founded all theſe arguments, upon ſcripture; thinking it would be more agreeable to reading in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; as the ſcriptures are by moſt people, in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, conſidered as a good hiſtory of divine revelation. But it is quite as eaſy to demonſtrate from reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aid of ſcripture; that it belongs to men to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their own character and eternal ſtate. That it is utterly unfit, yea, in the nature of things impoſſible, that the character and ſtate of men ſhould be determined by any other than themſelves. As muſt appear I think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> every one, that conſiders what is meant by the term man. I come as propoſed, 5 To conſider Mr. R's anſwers to objections againſt his doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <q>OBJ. 1. The preceeding repreſentation muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be contrary to truth, and is really chargeable with blaſphemy: for it makes GOD the author of ſin.</q>
Mr. R. allows that if by author of ſin,
<q>is meant acting, loving ſin, or being a ſinner, to ſay that GOD is the author of ſin would be full of blaſphemy. And any ſcheme any ſentiment fairly implying this, ought to be rejected with the greateſt abhorrence.</q>
That the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding repreſentation is contrary to truth I have proved already. That it is full of blaſphemy and ought to be rejected, according to Mr. R's own confeſſion, I will now prove. By making it fully appear, that Mr. R's ſcheme, does really make GOD the actor or doer of all ſin. And that it does ſo, all muſt ſee, when they take into view the whole quantum of liberty that Mr. R. allows unto men. This we find in p. 43, 44.
<q>Men are not machines, are not acted like machines when they are hardened in ſin: for they are voluntary, they move and act of choice, whereas in a mere machine there is no volition. It is acted upon but doth not act, doth not put forth any exertion. There is then an eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026990_0047_0FD2B4E68564EF88"/>
A mere machine cannot exerciſe liberty, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be to blame, becauſe it has no deſign, no volition. But GOD in hardening ſinners doth not influence them in any ſuch manner, as to prevent ſin being their own act, or to prevent their acting of choice, and becauſe they act voluntarily, reſpecting that which is evil and and make the evil their own, they are to blame, are wholly without excuſe, ſinners are not compelled to do wickedly, whatever extrinſic influence there is in the production of volition it is not of the nature of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion. For we mean by compulſion, that power which effects a thing againſt or at leaſt without our will or conſent. The moſt hardened ſinners are, to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents moral agents and accountable becauſe they act freely.</q>
            </p>
            <p>According to Mr. R. all the difference between men and machines, is, that men chooſe, or act of choice, but a mere machine does not. He tells us that men are not acted like a windmill, becauſe they act of choice, and the whole amount of liberty he allows men is liberty of choice; and becauſe they act voluntarily, he ſays, they are to all intents moral agents and accountable; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they chooſe that which is evil, he fixes blame upon them.</p>
            <p>But are any ſo blind as not to ſee that the beaſts of the field, and the birds of the air, enjoy liberty in as full, complete, and ample a manner as men, according to Mr. R. for they will and chooſe what they do as really as men; and it may with as much truth, be ſaid of them, as of men, that they do as they are pleaſed to do. That they act freely, voluntarily and with liberty. But I never ſuppoſed until I read Mr. R's diſcourſe, that they were accounted by any to be moral agents. But ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they were conſidered as without blame, becauſe they had no power over their volitions. They being ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects produced in them by the operation of cauſes, not within their governing command. So likewiſe mad men, their actions are voluntary, they do nothing but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of previous will and pleaſure; but who, except Mr. R. ever thought they were moral agents, and their
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026990_0048_0FD2B4E429462980"/>
actions morally good or evil! Now what is the reaſon that men, 'till Mr. R. appeared in print, have thought ſo differently of the actions of diſtracted men, and others who have the full uſe of their mental powers? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hy the true and only reaſon is, the former are hurried on to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition by a wild impetuous, over which they have no power; but the latter have it in their power to reſtrain and govern their wills and choices.</p>
            <p>We feel in ourſelves, not only a power to will, but a power over our volitions; and ſuch an one as enables us to direct, ſuſpend, overrule, or put an intire ſtop to them: nor, unleſs we were poſſeſſed of this dominion, could we be agents; however great liberty might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us in bringing into event what we have previouſly willed. It is eſſential to free agency, and ſuch a uſe of it as to make us capable of good or ill deſert, that our volitions upon which our actions follow, ſhould be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in reach of our command. The plain truth is, ſuch a power in men as will make them cauſes, real proper cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their volitions, and the effects conſequent upon them, is the grand ſupporting pillar of the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as moral. Take this away, and it at once falls into deſolation and utter ruin. If men's volitions, and their conſequent effects, are the reſult of invariable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, in virtue of exterior cauſes ſo inviolably connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that they will and muſt come to paſs, the author of this connection, which, according to Mr. R. is GOD, is the only agent in out world, and the only efficient, and real author, of whatever has been, or ſhall hereafter be brought into event; not excluding any of the moſt complicated villanies that have been, or may be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by any of the ſons of Adam.</p>
            <p>Thus plain it is, that Mr. R's ſcheme makes the ever glorious GOD, the actor of all ſin and wickedneſs that ever was, or ever will be in our world. It is therefore according to his own acknowledgment, blaſphemous and ought to be rejected with the greateſt abhorrence.</p>
            <p>Mr. R's ſcheme makes it neceſſary that GOD ſhould ſome how or other, be the author of ſin, and hence he labours this, to the utmoſt of his ability; and even quite
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:026990_0049_0FD2B4E505611728"/>
beyond his ability. In p. 41 he ſays,
<q>Certainly, it is too much for any to ſay he (GOD) could not poſſibly have prevented it.</q>
Leſt ſome, leſs diſcerning, ſhould be miſled by this, and too eaſily go into the opinion, that ſin does belong to GOD's plan, is really agreeable to his dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tive will, as Mr. R. ſays. I would in the firſt place obſerve. That moral evil as diſtinguiſhed from natural, is eſſentially connected with free agency, in the beings upon whom this guilt is faſtened. It's nature conſiſts in wrong determinations, and diſorderly conduct, which yet are voluntary, and argue a wilful miſapplication of moral and rational powers. Free agents therefore, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not GOD, are the ſole and proper authors of it. It takes riſe intirely from them, and would never have been but for their corrupt choices, and voluntary perverſion of faculties, which they might have employed to wiſe and good purpoſes. And ſhall a production wholly owing to creatures, and which never could have exiſted, had they not abuſed their powers, be charged to the ever glorious GOD! How ſurprizing, that it ſhould ever enter into the heart of any man, that ſin belongs to GOD's plan, is agreeable to his decretive and providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial will! Secondly, I would obſerve, that ſince GOD is a being of infinite purity and holineſs, I think he muſt have prevented ſin if he could have done it. Yet let it be remembered that I have not ſo much reſpect to a nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural, as to a moral ability; an ability invariably, guided, in all its exertions, by preſent wiſdom, and the reaſon and nature of things.</p>
            <p>I think in this ſenſe, it was not in the power of the great firſt cauſe, to have prevented moral defection. If it was, why was it not done? and in what poſſible way can the now prevention of it be reconciled with infinite holineſs and goodneſs? whereas if GOD could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, in conſiſtency with wife and fit conduct, it is a good reaſon why he did not do it. And this I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be the caſe; and therefore differ from Mr. R. as certain as he is, and think that it is not too much for us to ſay, that GOD could not poſſibly prevent ſin. I will give my reaſons for differing from Mr. R. in this
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:026990_0050_0FD2B510CAE74A50"/>
point; and ſubmit them to the judicious. If GOD could prevent ſin it muſt be one of theſe ways, viz. Either by not giving free agents a place in the ſcale of beings; or by making them ſo perfect as to be incapable of any wrong conduct; or by interpoſing at all times, as occaſion might require, to hinder the miſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no mortal agents, there would be no way for the Deity to manifeſt his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al glory, which is his greateſt. No manifeſtation of holineſs, juſtice, goodneſs, mercy, forbearance, long-ſuffering, forgiveneſs. If no free agents, there could be no virtue, in a word, there could be no ſuch thing as moral government, without which, the richeſt diſplays of the moſt amiable perfection could have no place in the creation. This conſidered, will it not be thought quite unfit that the bleſſing of moral liberty ſhould be withheld. As to the ſecond, viz. by making free agents ſo perfect as to be incapable of wrong conduct. But is not this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the nature of things? As creatures with all their perfections, would yet be finite, and how intelligent moral beings that are finite ſhould be wholly incapable of becoming faulty, in any kind, or degree, is beyond all conception, to me it appears reaſonable to think, that the infinitely perfect Being is the only one that can be abſolutely impeccable. But ſhould it be ſuppoſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally poſſible in conſiſtency with wiſe and fit conduct in the Deity? Perhaps thus ſpeaking it is not poſſible. So far as our knowledge extends, it is certain, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilligent moral beings are not when they firſt come into exiſtance, either ſo perfect or happy as they may be. But are ſo formed as to be capable of progreſs, both in perfection and happineſs; which progreſs depends much
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:026990_0051_0FD2B4E8213B33C0"/>
on the uſe they make of their implanted powers. Their faculties at firſt are feeble, but capable of gradual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement, and their enlargement in a great meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on themſelves. Neither perfection nor happineſs, is communicated to us independent of our own choice and conduct, but in connection therewith, and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, and as a reward therefor. And as this is the way that GOD hath choſen to communicate happineſs, and we have good reaſon to believe, that he ſaw it the fitteſt and beſt way, and being ſo it was not poſſible for him, acting morally, or as an intelligent wiſe agent, to communicate it any other way. And I think this appears to an attentive mind, the fitteſt method of communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to reaſonable moral beings. And this reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holds good with regard to all ranks of moral agents. In the ſcriptures we read of Angels which ſinned, and of Angels which kept not their firſt eſtate; which ſuppoſes they were not made happy independent of their own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous conduct, but were made as men are, capable of happineſs but liable to voluntary ſelf corruption. And all ranks of moral beings muſt be created ſo, if this was moſt wiſe, and fit, and we have good reaſon to think it was ſo. It does not ſeem meet and fit, that happineſs ſhould be conferred on moral intelligent beings; until they have gone through ſome ſtate of trial, wherein they have made the happineſs proper to their natures their own choice.</p>
            <p>This is certainly conſonent to the notions we moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and naturally form of right and fit. And doubtleſs it did appear to the infinite and ſupreme mind, to be the fitteſt way to communicate happineſs to moral beings; and if this was the real truth, it could not be within the moral power of the Deity, to have created free agents, and put them at once, without previous trial or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a ſtate of full perfection, and confirmed happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And if ſo they could not have been made impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. As to the third and laſt way poſſible to prevent moral defection, viz, by Deity's interpoſing at all times, as occaſion ſhould require, to keep free agents from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing their liberty. And this looks like a moral impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:026990_0052_0FD2B516615BE2F0"/>
as utterly unfit; in the reaſon of things, not being ſuited to the nature of ſuch kind of beings. Such a kind of government is well ſuited to the unintelligent part of the creation, but unſuitable for moral agents, as it renders their moral agency wholly uſeleſs and and leaves no room for virtue, deſtroys the moral gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of the Deity, and leaves no difference between them, and mere inanimate beings as to the Deity's exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing rule over them. And why then ſhould ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and abilities be given men, if they were by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Deity thus tendered uſeleſs? Theſe things conſidered, I think it not too much for us to ſay that GOD could not poſſibly prevent ſin; ſince it appears fit that moral agents ſhould have a place in the ſcale of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and this muſt be with powers ſo imperfect as to import a poſſibility of their erring, without interpoſitions of the Deity to prevent it: which interpoſitions, could not conſiſt with wiſe and fit conduct, becauſe in true conſtruction they would deſtroy the very notion of free agency, and with it all foundation for any diſtinction between moral right and wrong.</p>
            <p>Theſe thoughts accrued to my mind, long ſince; when ſtudying how to reconcile, the being of ſin in the world, with the wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD, and were a relief to me, when I knew not as any other perſon ever thought in ſuch a track. But upon conſulting an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity I found ſeveral among the ancients, who in their writing have ſuggeſted nearly the ſame thoughts. Among moderns Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> on the benevolence of the Deity is the beſt I have read, on the ſubject; I am much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to him for that ingenious work. And when Mr. R. ſhall have conſidered this ſubject a little more, he may be leſs certain that GOD could prevent ſin, or that it does belong to the divine plan.</p>
            <p>In p. 40, Mr. R. ſays,
<q>Will the objector inſiſt, that ſin in event was not comprehended in the divine plan. And that GOD meant, every way as much as poſſible, to guard againſt and prevent ſuch an effect?</q>
Reply, ſurely I will inſiſt upon this. But I cannot admit your conſequences, when you ſay,
<q>He may as well ſay there
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026990_0053_0FD2B4EB542BA688"/>
was no plan, and there is no divine diſpoſal; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>y there is any ſuch thing as moral evil in the ſyſtem.</q>
Gentlemen who undertake to correct the miſtakes of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, certainly ought to exhibit, cloſe, clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive reaſoning, upon true and well diſpoſed premiſes. But I am miſtaken if Mr. R. has done this here, I call upon him to ſhow, if he can how theſe conſequences fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from ſaying that ſin does not belong to GOD's plan. I am ſorry any thing ſo crude and indigeſted, ſhould drop from the pen of a Clergyman.</p>
            <p>
               <q>OBJ. 2. According to what hath been advanced it is neceſſary that ſome ſhould be hardened to their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction. If ſo liberty is deſtroyed; men are mere machines; and there can be no reaſon to impute guilt and blame to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. R. allows, a neceſſity of being hardened but ſays 'tis
<q>a neceſſity of a moral kind—a certainty: yet this is no ſuch neceſſity as is oppoſed to liberty. It is neceſſary GOD ſhould act in a holy manner; yet he acts with the moſt perfect freedom. And there is a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that the glorified ſaints will be holy and happy forev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; by which their liberty, their moral agency will not be deſtroyed or infringed; but confirmed and exalted.</q>
What an attempt is here to reconcile the liberty of men in a ſtate of trial with neceſſity!</p>
            <p>I would aſk Mr. R. whether GOD is in a ſtate of trial, or can be tempted to do evil? Surely this is the caſe with men. And as to what he ſays of glorified ſaints it is openly falſe; for if they are now in a confirmed ſtate of holineſs they have loſt their liberty, which they had in their ſtate of trial; when they were not confirmed in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. I am aſhamed, that ſuch reaſoning, if it may be called reaſoning; ſhould drop from the pen of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Mr. R's character. But unlucky for the good gentleman he propoſed objections, to his ſcheme, that never can be anſwered. And to me it is wonderful that he did not ſee that this objection was unanſwerable. But we ſhall find upon examination, that this is truly the caſe with every objection, that they cannot be anſwered upon his principles; The firſt part of the objection reſpects
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:026990_0054_0FD2B5192290A5E8"/>
the deſtruction of liberty; and Mr. R. has done noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to remove it. But before I paſs to another objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will attend to what he has to ſay to the other part of the objection, viz,
<q>Men are mere machines; and there can be no reaſon to impute guilt and blame to them.</q>
Mr. R. in reply ſays,
<q>Men are not machined, for they move and act of choice, whereas in a mere machine there is no volition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But why did not Mr. R. conſider, that the cattle on a thouſand hills act of choice as well as men? Mr. R. tells us,
<q>If there is no liberty, and moral agency men are not to blame.</q>
But all the liberty he allows men is liberty of choice, if this makes them moral agents, all the fiſhes in the ſea are moral agents. Mr. R. inſiſts upon it that,
<q>Sinners are not compelled to do wickedly; and becauſe they act voluntarily they are to blame, are wholly without excuſe.</q>
But is it not a truth, and plain to the underſtanding of every man, except Mr. R. that, that which maketh a man ſin by way of neceſſity, with and not againſt his will, is the cauſe of his ſin in a worſe manner, than that which conſtraineth him to ſin againſt his will? I think it will be granted by all men, that he who by wicked art, draweth a man to ſtab, hang, or poiſon himſelf, is in a groſſer manner the cauſe of that evil action, then he that by force compelleth him, becauſe he maketh him to conſent to his own death. Now if GOD's decrees do not only make men ſin, but ſin willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too; not only cauſe that they ſhall do evil, but will evil; GOD hath a deeper hand in men's ſins, than if he forced them againſt their wills. It is in vain therefore for Mr. R. to ſay,
<q>Sinners are not compelled to do wickedly,</q>
for according to him they are much worſe than compelled. He tells us that GOD has decreed ſin, that his providence orders the occaſion; and he at the ſame time withholds that influence neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſin, ſo that the ſinner is under a neceſſity of fining, and in order to make him guilty, he is by the arts of providence neceſſitated to will fin! This doctrine makes the ſinners condition very ſad; but it is moſt diſhonorable to Almighty GOD. We now ſee, that Mr.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:026990_0055_0FD2B4ED8993C840"/>
R. by attempting to remove this objection, has only made bad, worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>OBJ. 3. The ſentence, whom he will he hardeneth, as it hath been ſtated, implies a denial of the divine holineſs. For the moral law is a tranſcript of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections; diſcovers the heart the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Deity. He there forbids ſin upon pain of eternal diſpleaſure, and repreſents it to be that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing which his ſoul abhors. But if ſin was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in his plan and diſpoſal of things, it muſt be agreeable to his mind that ſin ſhould take place. And it is falſe to ſay, he is of purer eyes than to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: for he muſt according to this doctrine; behold it with complacency rather than abhorrence; becauſe it is his choice and the conſequence of his diſpoſals.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. R. allows, that if the ſentiment advanced doth really imply a denial, of any repugnancy to the holineſs of the Deity it ought to be rejected. And further he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that ſin is diametrically oppoſite to holineſs, is what GOD muſt neceſſarily hate with perfect deteſtation. But inſiſts upon it, there is no denial of holineſs in ſaying GOD wills the event. To clear this he propoſes a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction to be conſidered, p. 45.
<q>A diſtinction is to made between GOD's preceptive, and decretive provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential will. The Bible teaches us to make ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. And it is neceſſary to reconcile what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe might appear to be irreconcilable. A diſtinction of this kind is evidently implied in what is ſaid, reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the conduct of Joſeph's brethren, in ſelling him to the Iſhmaelites—in what is ſaid reſpecting the king of Aſſyria—and the part the Jews acted in the crucifixion of Chriſt. Now were ſin in event as contrary to the decretive and providential, as ſin itſelf is to the precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive will of GOD, we may be ſure it never would take place, on ſuppoſition there was a poſſibility of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. And to ſay there was no poſſibility is to limit the divine power. But GOD certainly could prevent it, if no other way, by withholding exiſtance. And this he no doubt would do rather than ſin ſhould take place, were ſin in event, as contrary to his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial as to his preceptive will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:026990_0056_0FD2B51A5E4056C8"/>On reading what has been ſaid above, Mr. R. may think, that it is no limitation of the divine power to ſay, that GOD could not poſſibly prevent ſin: and be leſs confident that if he could do it no other way, he would by withholding exiſtence. But in order to ſet the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter now before me in a clear light, it ſeems neceſſary to look a little into the diſtinction, which Mr. R. ſays is neceſſary to be made; between GOD's preceptive and his decretive providential will. And likewiſe into the meaning of ſin in <hi>event,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from ſin <hi>itſelf.</hi> And then bring up to view, the ſentence, whom he will he hardeneth, as it hath been ſtated by Mr. R. and ſee whether there is in it any oppoſition to the holineſs of the Deity. I am ſorry that Mr. R. has not plainly told us what he means by theſe terms, then we ſhould not be liable to miſtake him. However it is likely, he will agree with the Aſſembly of Divines, that by the decree of GOD is to be underſtood, his eternal purpoſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the counſel of his own will, whereby for his own glory he foreordains whatſoever comes to paſs. As to GOD's providential will, it is likely he means, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, wiſe, regular, powerful government of the world by GOD. By the preceptive will of GOD, he may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, thoſe commands, laws and rules GOD has given to men, in his word. As to the diſtinction, between ſin in <hi>event</hi> and <hi>ſin itſelf,</hi> I am at a loſs, reſpecting Mr. R's meaning; but I will venture to ſuppoſe, that by ſin itſelf, he means the ſinful action, which the law forbids, and ſo is againſt the preceptive will of GOD the lawgiver. And by ſin in event the reſult or iſſue of the ſinful action.</p>
            <p>As to the ſentence, whom he will he hardeneth, Mr. R. often tells us what it means, particularly, p. 15.
<q>The great queſtion is what are we to underſtand by, whom he will he hardeneth? or in what ſenſe may it be truly ſaid that GOD hardeneth any man? This is a tremend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly delicate ſubject.—And there ſeemeth to be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on both hands; ſo that by ſteering beyond the proper point to avoid Scylla, we may fall into Charyb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis. And this I apprehend we ſhall do. If on one
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:026990_0057_0FD2B4EF34416930"/>
hand, we wholly deny any interpoſition and divine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal in reſpect to the taking place of ſin, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeries—a confirmed ſtate in wickedneſs, ending in eternal ruin and deſtruction. p. 16. ſince GOD hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth whom he will, it is certain his will, in ſome ſenſe muſt be concerned in hardening men; and the active verb hardeneth doth import ſome divine agency and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, ſo that without flat contradiction to the plaineſt aſſertion of the pen of inſpiration, we cannot wholly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the will and agency of GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After a long diſcourſe of ſeveral pages; in order to make out, that the event called ſin, may not require the ſame agency of GOD for the production of it, as the effect call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed holineſs, in p. 19. he comes to this concluſion.
<q>To ſum up the whole, I think it more ſafe, and doth better accord with the ſcriptures to ſay, that GOD orders the occaſion, and for wiſe and important ends doth not interpoſe that influence, which in the given circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would be neceſſary to prevent ſin and impenitence; than that he cauſes ſin and impenitence by his own poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and immediate energy.</q>
According to Mr. R. ſin, and impenitence in ſin, and the eternal ruin and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of ſinners, is the effect of the will and agency of GOD. And to deny this, is to contradict the plaineſt aſſertion of the pen of inſpiration. The reader will here take notice, how Mr. R's miſtaking the meaning of the ſcripture he predicated his diſcourſe upon, has unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead him into this blaſphemous opinion. But to ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the matter a little, he is willing we ſhould think, that GOD does not cauſe ſin and impenitence by his own poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and immediate energy; but by his providence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the occaſion, at the ſame time withholds that influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which in the given circumſtances would be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prevent ſin and impenitence. But does this at all help the matter? Is it not true, that he that withholds light cauſes darkneſs? Is it not true, that he that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth a thing, which being preſent would hinder an event, is the ſole cauſe of the event? As he that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds a pillar which ſhould ſupport a houſe, is the true cauſe of the falling of that houſe. So GOD by withhhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026990_0058_0FD2B51BC6936538"/>
neceſſary influence from men, is the true cauſe of their ſin. It will not help the matter at all to ſay that GOD by withholding neceſſary influence, becomes only an accidental, not a direct cauſe of men's ſins. For a cauſe is then only accidental in relation to the effect, when the effect is beſide the intention &amp; expectation of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>As digging in a field is then an accidental cauſe of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a bag of gold, when that event is not intended or expected by the huſbandman in digging. But when the event is looked for and aimed at, the cauſe (though it be the cauſe only by withholding) is not accidental, as a pilot who withholdeth his care and ſkill from a ſhip in a ſtorm, foreſeeing that by his neglect the ſhip will be loſt, is not to be reputed an accidental, but a direct cauſe of the loſs of that ſhip. Hence, if it be true as Mr. R. tells us, that GOD hath decreed ſin in event, and by his providence orders the occaſion, he at the ſame time withholding nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary influence to prevent ſin, not being ignorant of what will follow, but knowing it infallibly, determining preciſely that which doth follow, namely the impenitence and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of ſinners, becometh the proper and direct cauſe of their ſins and their damnation.</p>
            <p>That Mr. R. had quite as good affirm that GOD cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſin and impenitence, by his own poſitive and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate energy. Mr. R. tells us that a diſtinction is to be made, between GOD's preceptive, and decretive provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential will; that ſuch a diſtinction is neceſſary in order to reconcile what otherwiſe might appear to be irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable. But he has not applied it, and I know not how to do it. And for my life I cannot ſee, either any ground for the diſtinction, or any help it can poſſibly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. And I do hereby call upon Mr. R. to explain himſelf fully upon this head.</p>
            <p>Mr. R. tells us,
<q>that whatſoever takes place through the ſyſtem, from beginning to end, takes place in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence with the decretive and providential will of GOD; but ſin takes place in perfect oppoſition to his precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive will.</q>
But he denies that the decree is repugnant to the command. I will try to illuſtrate this matter by what is recorded of David, 2 Sam. xi chap. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:026990_0059_0FD2B4F43AF89E60"/>
obſerved that if I underſtand Mr. R. by what he calls ſin in event, and which he ſays is agreeable to the decretive and providential will of GOD; he means the reſult or iſſue of a wicked action. Now the reſult of David's act of adultery with the wife of Uriah, was that ſhe was with child. This event of David's ſin made a part of the divine plan, was what GOD purpoſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the counſel of his will and foreordained ſhould be. And as GOD's decrees are powerful and active, his counſel ſtands and his pleaſure is done in heaven and on earth, providence therefore we may be ſure, will bring into event whatever GOD has decreed ſhall be. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in this caſe providence orders the occaſion; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid from the roof of his houſe, ſees the woman, is ſtruck with her beauty, enquires her out, ſends for her, and when they come together that the eternal decree and purpoſe of GOD might not be fruſtrated; GOD withholds from them both, that influence, which under theſe circumſtances, was neceſſary to prevent Adultery. Accordingly David lay with her, and ſhe proving with child, the eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and purpoſe of GOD was fulfilled, the end of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence anſwered, and his will done, and David's prayers, if he prayed that the will of GOD might be done, were now moſt happily anſwered. But there is a precept for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding this, under the name of Adultery, and threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death to the Adulterer; what ſhall we do with this? The will of GOD decreeing the event, and ordering ſuch a concurrence of circumſtances, as to render the action neceſſary to the event eligible, and at the ſame time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding neceſſary help againſt temptation, ſeems not to agree with his forbidding the action, and under a ſevere penalty too. It is wonderful to me, that when Mr. R. was making this diſcourſe, he did not advert to what the Apoſtle ſays, 1 Cor. x. 13. GOD is faithful, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what ye are able; but will with the temptation alſo, make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it. I hope thoſe whoſe minds may be filled with horror and deſpair, on viewing the character Mr. R. gives of our heavenly father, will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert hereto and be comforted under all trials.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:026990_0060_0FD2B51D42A9D6C8"/>Mr. R. tells us p. 46.
<q>It doth not follow, that the decree is in oppoſition to the command—it doth not follow, that GOD's will in the former caſe, oppoſes his will in the latter—it doth not follow that GOD hath two wills, thwarting each other. Were there a real op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, inſiſting on the diſtinction would run us into the Manichean hereſy, or what would be as groſs. And would even amount to a denial of divine exiſtence.</q>
What is there no oppoſition between the will of GOD, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing ſin, ordering the occaſion for it, and withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from men that influence neceſſary to avoid it, and his will forbiding of it? Does not GOD's will decreeing and ordering ſin oppoſe his will in forbiding of it? Doth it not follow that GOD hath two wills, thwarting each other, when he decrees ſin and by his all powerful providence renders it inevitable, and yet in his law forbids it on pain of death? If GOD's will in all this is perfectly concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, as Mr. R. tells us it is; I would pray him to tell us what does conſtitute oppoſition, or occaſion things to thwart each other. I would pray Mr. R. to conſider how he will make it appear that David and Uriah's wife ſinned at all, ſince what they did was but fulfiling GOD's decree, and complying with his providence, and as to them inevitable, they having no power to do otherwiſe, or forbare doing as they did. Mr. R. has told us what he will ſay to this, p. 43.
<q>And becauſe they act volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, reſpecting that which is evil and make the evil their own, they are to blame, are wholly without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</q>
But ſurely they were not more to blame or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable than Balaam's aſs was for falling down under him. Sin has ever been conſidered by men, the will to do that from which we have freedom to abſtain. But David and Uriah's wife had not that influence which was neceſſary to prevent their doing juſt as they did, and conſequently neceſſary for them to do as they did, as neceſſary as for Balaam's aſs to turn out of the way and at laſt to fall under him, and as ſhe was beat moſt unjuſtly, ſo, according to Mr. R. to blame David and Uriah's wife for what they did would be moſt unjuſt. They cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly wanted nothing but a righteous Judge and they
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:026990_0061_0FD2B4F795F6C1C8"/>
would be acquitted as well as the poor aſs; unleſs men have hitherto been miſtaken about what ſin is. Mr. R. tells us p. 46.
<q>Sin is conſidered by GOD, in his decree and providence relative to it, as being perfectly evil and hateful. And as ſuch by him to be oppoſed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such a ſentence as this, to fall from the lips of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Mr. R's ſentiments, is moſt wonderful! If this be true, then when GOD willed to decree ſin he hated to will it, or willed what he hated! i. e. Chooſe what he did not chooſe! And he muſt neceſſarily hate his own decree, and his own providence that brings it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto event, yea, he muſt neceſſarily look upon his own decree and providence reſpecting ſin, not only as being perfectly evil and hateful, but as what by him is to be conſtantly oppoſed! Mr. R. tells us, p. 45.
<q>Whatſoever takes place through the ſyſtem, from beginning to end, takes place in conſiſtence with the decretive and providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial will of GOD; but ſin takes place in perfect op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to his preceptive will.</q>
In this ſentence theſe three things are expreſſed. 1. That ſin does take place. 2. That it is agreeable to the decretive and providential will of GOD that it ſhould. 3. That it is yet in perfect oppoſition to his preceptive will. If this does not make out two wills in GOD, continually thwarting each other, I think no words can do it. Mr. R. tells us p. 46.
<q>That while the exerciſe of one and the ſame will of the Deity is diſtinguiſhed, it is and may appear, even to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, perfectly harmonious.</q>
Reply, It may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo to Mr. R's underſtanding, but certainly it does not to mine. How a will exerciſed in bringing into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent oppoſites, as ſin and holineſs, can be hermonious, is to me inconceivable. The harmony of the will exerciſed upon oppoſites, muſt either deſtroy the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or the oppoſition muſt deſtroy the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. If the will of GOD decreeing that Uriah's wife ſhould be with child by David, is perfectly harmonious with his will forbidding adultery, then when Uriah's wife was with child by David according to the decretive and providential will of GOD, they could not be condemned by the precept forbidding adultery, nor could there be any reaſon for GOD's being diſpleaſed with David, for the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:026990_0062_0FD2B51EECE42830"/>
thing that he had done. For this would at once deſtroy the harmony of the divine will, exerciſed in decreeing events and in giving laws; and clearly ſhow that they were oppoſite and did thwart each other. Mr. R. muſt now give up his diſtinction or run himſelf into ſomething more groſs, than the miſtake of Manes. In p. 47. Mr. R. ſuppoſes, as well he might, that ſome would aſk,
<q>Why may not GOD command his creatures to ſin with a view to his own glory, and the advancement of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as decree ſin in event with ſuch a view? (to which he anſwers) To all that can be urged in ſuch a line, this will be a ſufficient rejoinder. That Paul has obviated and repelled with indignation a ſimilar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, as if it were a juſt conſequence from the doctrine he had advanced, ſee Rom. iii. 7, 8.</q>
But Mr. R. ought to conſider, that there is no ſimilarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſubject Paul was diſcourſing and the ſubject of his diſcourſe. And although the objection the Apoſtle ſuppoſes the Jews would make againſt his doctrine was without foundation, yet the objection againſt Mr. R's. doctrine is well founded, and could he have anſwered it, I think he would not have made uſe of ſuch a mean eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Upon the whole, the objection as ſtated by Mr. R. ſtands in full force againſt his ſcheme, not only as it implies a denial of the divine holineſs, but as it moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently makes GOD the only ſinner in the univerſe. And what he has ſaid under the objection and to remove it, really makes the matter much worſe, than otherwiſe it would have been. I have therefore his conſent for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the ſentence, whom he will he hardeneth, as ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>OBJ. 4. If GOD hath mercy on whom he will, and hardeneth whom he will, in the ſenſe that hath been ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he is the moſt tyrannical being in the univerſe. For it repreſents him as exerciſing an odious partiality in his treatment of his creatures, as making a multitude of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings on purpoſe to damn them. And as acting manifeſt injuſtice and cruelty in his diſpoſal of things.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this Mr. R. replies, 1ſt, by ſhewing that ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and tyranny are not the ſame. That although GOD is
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026990_0063_0FD2B4F894923470"/>
a ſovereign, it doth not follow that he is tyrant. But Mr. R. tells us that God withholds that influence from men, in the hour of trial, which is neceſſary to prevent ſin, who yet forbids it on pain of death. Now what makes a tyrant if requiring brick without ſtraw does not? 2d. Mr. R. tells us that,
<q>In making one man unto honor and another unto diſhonor, there is not the ſhadow of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. This might be urged with good reaſon if God had, or ſhould devote men to, deſtruction without any conſideration of their demerits.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let it be remembered here, that according to Mr. R. GOD not only decrees ſin, but by his powerful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence orders the occaſion, at the ſame time withholding from men neceſſary help againſt ſin; ſo that it becomes abſolutely impoſſible, that men ſhould do otherwiſe than they do. Now is it not a plain caſe, that ſin is an action from which the ſinner might abſtain. But according to Mr. R. men can do no otherwiſe than they do; why then does he talk about demerit? According to him it is impoſſible there can be any ſuch thing. Three things are neceſſary to make an action culpable. 1. That it be in our power to do or forbear it. 2. That we be obliged to do or forbear it. 3. That we omit what we ought to have done, or do what we ought not to have done.</p>
            <p>If a tyrant ſhould require me to tell whether the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Jupiter is inhabited or not, or to fly to the moon, as one is above my intellectual faculty to diſcover, and the other above my active faculty to perform; neither of them can be my duty. And to neglect them cannot be my ſin. According to Mr. R. thoſe whom GOD har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens have no ſin, and if damned as he ſays they will be; though they will be moſt cruelly treated, yet they will ſurely have a good conſcience, and be eternally aſſured that could they but have a righteous judge, they ſhould be honourably acquitted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mr. R. tells us,
<q>No cruelty will be exerciſed. GOD will certainly inflict endleſs puniſhment upon finally impenitent ſinners; yet he doth not delight in the death of ſinners.</q>
Reply, is it not cruel to inflict
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026990_0064_0FD2B524D0B154A8"/>
endleſs puniſhment on men, for neglecting what they never could do; or doing what they never could avoid? And does not he delight in the death of men, who damn's them for nothing but his pleaſure?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mr. R. tells us p. 50 that,
<q>Hardening ſome, and ſaving others doth not make GOD to be a reſpector of perſons, in the ſenſe the ſcrip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Reply, the ſentiment advanced by Mr. R. is that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of mercy is wholly reſolved into the will and ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereign pleaſure of the Deity, ſee p. 10. The ſaying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to, makes the fearing God, and working righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ground of acceptance.

How vain is it for Mr. R. to try to reconcile his ſentiments with ſcripture. The reader now ſees, that the objection is not in the leaſt weakened by any thing that Mr. R. has ſaid, but ſtands in full force againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>OBJ. 5. The ſubject, as it hath been ſtated and defended, makes GOD to act in a trifling inſincere manner, and impoſe upon men in the calls and offers of the goſpel. Becauſe he appears to expreſs great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tenderneſs towards ſinners, willing rather that they ſhould turn and live; when he is determined at the ſame time, to withhold his ſaving mercy from mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, and make them monuments of his eternal wrath. What poſſible kindneſs and ſincerity can their be in offering ſalvation to any, except thoſe on whom he will have mercy? And why may it not with propriety be deemed ludicrous to invite and urge all to come? Uſing language too which carries the appearance of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026990_0065_0FD2B4FA06612DC0"/>
and zeal, and proceeding ſo far as to beſeech ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to be reconciled; when by an unfruſtrable decree he hath excluded from a ſhare of his ſaving mercy, it may he the greater part of thoſe to whom he makes the propoſal and gives the invitations, ſo warmly and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically urged and enforced? And is determined that they ſhall be hardened to their eternal deſtruction.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. R. replies to this by ſaying,
<q>GOD is perfectly ſincere in the offers he makes and the invitations he gives to ſinners. Is as willing all ſhould comply with his calls, as he is, that all ſhould obey him.</q>
But pray Sir, is GOD willing thoſe ſhould obey him, from whom he withholds that influence neceſſary to enable them ſo to do? Is it not tantalizing men to clog the offers he makes them with impoſſible conditions? Two ways Mr. R. attempts to vindicate the divine ſincerity. 1ſt. by ſaying,
<q>It is ſufficient to vindicate the divine ſincerity, that GOD ſtands ready to fullfill and beſtow what is ſet forth in the calls and offers he gives and makes, on ſuppoſition they are complied with by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: For this is clear and certain, whoſoever will may come; and him that cometh Chriſt will in no wiſe caſt out. There is no decree or divine diſpoſal to prevent their coming if they will.</q>
Here let it be remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Mr. R. affirms a divine decree and diſpoſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſin and impenitency therein; and that GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually does withhold from men that influence neceſſary to prevent ſin and impenitency. Now that which diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a man from chooſing good or refuſing evil, muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his liberty to chooſe good or refuſe evil. But GOD by withholding neceſſary influence renders men totally unable to chooſe good or refuſing evil, and of courſe whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroys all liberty of will. Hence there is no need of a decree to prevent their coming if they will, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their wills is already totally deſtroyed; being determined by GOD's decree, providence and withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary influence. Will Mr. R. ſay, that GOD does not take from men the faculty of willing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to blame for not chooſing good; ſince they attain the power. This is the ſame as to ſay, a Bird re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026990_0066_0FD2B526C17E1098"/>
the power of flying when I hold his wings; or that a man chang'd, is free to walk, becauſe he retains the faculty of walking. Mr. R. muſt remove out of the way his decrees, before he can vindicate the divine ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in making offers to men. The calls and offers GOD in his word gives and makes to men, upon Mr. R's principles, appears not a whit better, than it would in me, ſhould I bind a man hand and foot, lock him up in a houſe, then ſet fire to it, and aſk him, why will you ſtay there and be burnt? As I live I have no pleaſure in your death. Come unto me and you ſhall not be caſt out. But would not ſuch conduct in me be morking and inſulting upon the miſery of the man? But not more ſo than goſpel offers are upon Mr. R's principles.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Mr. R. attempts to vindicate the divine ſincerity by ſaying as in p. 53.
<q>There is the ſame kindneſs and ſincerity as if GOD knew the offers would be moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially accepted. And his having mercy on ſome by diſpoſing them to except, is a diſtinct thing, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the calls and offers themſelves. Therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is readily conceded, that much greater kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is exerciſed by GOD towards thoſe on whom he hath mercy by making them willing in the day of his power, then towards thoſe who are not made willing: yet this greater mercy is not exerciſed in the calls that are given, the offers that are made; but in reſpect to the offers and the arguments uſed to induce a compliance, there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the ſame kindneſs and ſincerity towards all.</q>
i. e. none at all. For if ſalvation depends on GOD's having mercy upon a perſon, and GOD's having mercy on them be a thing diſtinct from the calls and offers of the goſpel; then GOD in the calls and offers of the goſpel ſhews <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o kindneſs to any, as I can ſee, The Angels quite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood the goſpel, and give us a very falſe account of it, when they call it glad tidings of great joy to all people! Mr. R. tells us,
<q>GOD might be ſincere in making the offer to all on ſuppoſition none did, and not one ever ſhould accept.</q>
But your buſineſs Sir, is to ſhew that GOD is ſincere in making offers to thoſe he knows never can accept, and whom he has determined never ſhall accept. Otherwiſe you do nothing towards anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026990_0067_0FD2B4FB8553D0B8"/>
the objection. Mr. R. ſays,
<q>GOD is ſincere, ſerious and earneſt in requiring the ſubjection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of all thoſe who are in a ſtate of unregeneracy; although none in that ſtate do yield a cordial ſubjection and obedience to his commands, and he knows perfectly well that they will not.</q>
But does GOD know that they cannot? Has he predetermined that they ſhall not? Do you mean to grant this in what followeth?
<q>Alſo the not doing it, is as much the reſult of the divine decree and diſpoſal as hardening whom he will to their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction is the reſult of his decree and diſpoſal.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That the deſtruction of men is the reſult of the divine decree and diſpoſal, you have before declared; here you affirm, that the diſobedience of men to GOD's commands is as much the reſult of the divine decree and diſpoſal. But this ſir, is what is objected to, and which the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſays makes GOD to act in a trifling inſincere man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the calls and offers of the goſpel. Do therefore reconcile the divine ſincerity in the calls and offers of the goſpel, with ſuch decrees and diſpoſals, or own that you cannot anſwer the objection. Your ſaying that GOD is ſincere is not ſatisfactory to me, I call for proof. You add,
<q>We may as well ſay GOD acts ſarcaſtically, and tantalizes his creatures when he requires their ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obedience, they being and remaining indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to yield obedience, as that he doth ſo, when he makes offers, they being indiſpoſed to accept them.</q>
Very true when creatures diſobedience is the reſult of GOD's decree and diſpoſal, he does tantalize, inſult and abuſe them by commands, offers &amp;c. as I ſay; and you offer no proof to the contrary; yet go about to ſtop my mouth by dint of authority, when you ſay,
<q>Who art thou that thus replieſt againſt GOD? let thy mouth be ſtopped; or ſurely, thou ſhalt be moſt juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</q>
This ſir, I deſpiſe in you, and it convinces me that you felt yourſelf weak, or you would never take ſuch a method to ſilence objectors. I do not reply againſt GOD, but againſt the falſe character you ignorantly or wickedly give of the ever glorious GOD. And call upon you to vindicate yourſelf from the guilt of ſlandering the

               <q>OBJ. 6. This is a gloomy uncomfortable doctrine calculated to bad men; eſpecially awakened ſinners to deſpair: or elſe to ſtif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>le their convictions. The natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tendency of it is to render means and endeavours vain and uſeleſs. For if it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runeth: If the unregenerate may not lay any claim to ſaving mercy after all their moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeekings and ſtrivings: If there is a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber on whom GOD will have mercy, and a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whom he will harden to their deſtruction, to what purpoſe can it be to ſeek and ſtrive? each ſinner may ſay, if I am to be ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved, and if I am to periſh I ſhall periſh, let my exertions be as they may. And ſince it is not left to men to determine their own character, and aſcertain their eternal ſtate, but it hangs on a decree and diſpoſal which they cannot fruſtrate; let them ſtand ſtill, and ſee what GOD means to do, whether to ſave or damn; and give themſelves no exerciſe and concern about that which doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them; and which to ſay it doth belong to them implies a denial of GOD's eſſential, inalienable prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. R. has attempted five anſwers to this objection, without ſaying one word that does in the leaſt degree weaken it, but rather eſtabliſh it; particularly by his fourth anſwer, which is,
<q>There is not the leaſt ground from the doctrine to ſay, if we are to be ſaved we ſhall be ſaved, let us live as we may, and whether we take any pains or not. Becauſe repentance, faith, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience are implied in, or will certainly follow the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of ſaving mercy, whenever it is beſtowed upon any.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The objection ſays, ſince there is a certain number on whom GOD will have mercy and a certain number whom he will harden to their deſtruction; each ſinner may ſay, if I am to be ſaved I ſhall be ſaved &amp;c.—all exertions are
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026990_0069_0FD2B5004D1CC408"/>
vain, eſpecially ſince it is not left with men to determine their own character &amp;c.—Mr. R. ſays, there is no ground for this objection, becauſe repentance, faith, and obedience are implied in, or will certainly follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſaving mercy, whenever it is beſtowed upon any. Now, according to Mr. R. eternal ſalvation is connected with GOD's having mercy on any; but GOD's having mercy on any, depends neither in whole nor in part upon any thing done by them, or any ſtate of mind they may be in. Therefore, if faith, repentance, and obedience, do certainly follow GOD's having mercy on any, it is a good reaſon why ſinners ſhould be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about faith, repentance and obedience, for as theſe will follow mercy, but not at all further it, there is no reaſon why ſinners ſhould be concerned about them. Every ſinner may now ſay, not only, if I am to be ſaved I ſhall be ſaved, and if I am to periſh I ſhall periſh; but if I am to have repentance, faith and obedience. I ſhall have them, and if I am to remain impenitent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing and diſobedient I ſhall remain ſo. That upon Mr. R's ſcheme, there is not one whit more reaſon for any man's concerning himſelf about religion, than about the ebbing and flowing of the tide. All that Mr. R. has done, in his anſwer to this objection, is to ſhow that ſinners have good reaſon to be unconcerned about the means of ſalvation as well as about ſalvation itſelf I Mr. R. ſays, he apprehends theſe objections to be the moſt conſiderable that any can advance againſt his ſcheme. I do not think ſo of them. However I have carefully attended the ſcuffle he has had with them, and find them all ſtanding in as good quality, condition and repair as before he threw a ſnow-ball at them. And Mr. R. has greatly diſhonoured himſelf, by attempting to anſwer, that, which upon his plan, is abſolutely unanſwerable.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I come as propoſed to make ſome remarks on Mr. R's improvement of his ſubject. The improvement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, p. 57. And is as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1.
<q>From what hath been urged and illuſtrated in the preceeding diſcourſe we may learn the vanity and futil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the objections, commonly advanced, againſt the
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:026990_0070_0FD2B52958349050"/>
devine decrees. And that decree in particular, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a certain number of mankind were from eternity ordained to everlaſting life, called the decree of election. The doctrine of an eternal decree, in a general view, is diſcarded by many. Barely to mention in eternal irrevocable decree fires their indignation; and more eſpecially to mention and inſiſt upon the decree of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If GOD according to the counſel of his own will from eternity, did chooſe a certain number in Chriſt and appoint them to obtain ſalvation, and paſs by the reſt; and that number will be ſaved and the reſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. Then ſay they: He muſt be a hateful reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of perſons, one who exerciſes partiality, injuſtice and cruelty: Muſt have a deſign to make creatures on purpoſe to damn them, and ſport with their miſery and deſtruction: Muſt be the author of their ſin and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction: Events are unalterably fixed beforehand; and being fixed, there can be no liberty in reſpect to chooſing and acting: men are machines, and ought not to be blamed: The old heatheniſh doctrine of fate is palmed upon the Bible: A great part of mankind have no chance for their lives: And it is as much an vain for men to ſeek and ſtrive and exert themſelves, as it is to attempt to alter immutability itſelf. In a word, men are chained down by unfruſtrable decree; the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine government is an exerciſe of the moſt obdious ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny: and it is not reaſonable, nor poſſible to love a being of ſuch a character. It is in a miſerable way of reaſoning, that ſuch conſequences are drawn, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into objections againſt the divine decree, in general, and that of election, in particular, they are moſt not all of them illogical, unfounded, vain and imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. R. has plainly told us his ſenſe of the doctrine of election in theſe words,
<q>GOD according to the counſel of his own will from eternity, did chooſe a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in Chriſt and appoint them to obtain ſalvation, and paſs by the reſt, and that number will be ſaved, and the reſt periſh.</q>
This I ſuppoſe to be Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>'s own ſentiment, or that opinion of the decree or election which he means to defend. He denies a conditional election,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026990_0071_0FD2B501B4789A18"/>
moſt expreſsly, p. 39,
<q>There cannot be any conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal decree or determination in the divine mind, reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his having mercy on ſome and hardening others.</q>
Mr. R's. opinion then is plainly this, namely, that GOD from eternity chooſe a certain number in Chriſt, whom he by an abſolute decree appointed to ſalvation; who ſhall all infallibly be ſaved, all the reſt be paſſed by, or left; and they ſhall infallibly periſh. That ſalvation was from eternity as certain to all choſen, and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as certain from eternity to all paſſed by, as GOD could make any thing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now undertake to ſhow that all the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mentioned by Mr. R. as drawn from the decree of election, do neceſſarily follow from his own opinion of that doctrine as here ſet down by him. And in doing this, I will take them ſeparately as they follow.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>1. Then GOD muſt be a hateful reſpector of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</q>
That GOD is the judge of all the earth. That he has given his reaſonable creatures a law, or rule of duty: and required them to obey his commands, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing rewards to the obedient, and threatening puniſhment to the diſobedient. And has bound himſelf to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their character, reward and puniſh them according as they ſhall be found, keepers or tranſgreſſors of the law, that they are under. Theſe are things which I ſuppoſe need no proof. But Mr. R. tells us, that GOD from eternity did chooſe ſome in Chriſt and appoint them to obtain ſalvation, leaving the reſt to periſh. But is this according to law? He further tells us,
<q>There is a moſt wide and important difference in the exerciſe of ſaving mercy, it is not beſtowed upon all mankind; but upon ſome only even thoſe upon whom GOD is pleaſed to beſtow it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if men's characters are determined and eternal ſtate fixed according to the pleaſure of the judge; the law is not the rule. But if a judge favours one and frowns upon, another according to his own pleaſure, is he not partial? Why were ſome choſen, when others were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by? all were equally near, equally needy, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſerving or undeſerving. Why then were ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:026990_0072_0FD2B52B587F87B8"/>
by and left to periſh? Mr. R. tells us it was the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of GOD. But does not this to all intents make GOD a reſpecter of perſons? Mr. R. tells us p. 13, that,
<q>No ſituation—external circumſtances, or even ſtate of mind perſons may be in antecedently to regeneration, ought to be conſidered as having the leaſt influence in the divine determination, reſpecting the beſtowment of his ſaving mercy.</q>
Reply, if the objects of ſaving mercy were choſen from eternity and appointed to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as Mr. R. tells us; I can eaſily believe, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, confeſſing and forſaking ſin, or any ſeeking or ſtriving of ſinners, will have no influence on the divine mind to beſtow mercy on any. But what does influence GOD to chooſe ſome of his children to be happy and leave others to be miſerable? Their circumſtances were exactly alike, and for a judge to favour one and frown upon another, when in equal circumſtances is to have reſpect to perſons; and what makes it hateful, is that it is contrary to equity. GOD as benefactor, may give five talents to one and but two to another, without wrong to any; but as a judge he has bound himſelf to do right. But to reward ſome with life and puniſh others with death, who are in equal circumſtances, muſt make him a hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reſpecter of perſons.</p>
            <p>Mr. R. p. 51, propoſes the caſe of a perſon,
<q>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an eſtate and no natural heir, (who he ſays) might ſelect one, or a few juſt as he ſhould pleaſe, on whom to confer his eſtate, and no one would have a right to tax him with being a reſpecter of perſons, becauſe he did not bequeath it to all without diſcrimination. And if ſuch a prerogative is allowed to men, in reſpect to what they poſſeſs and call their own, ſhall not GOD beſtow his ſpecial favours on whom he pleaſes, without the imputation of being an odious reſpecter of perſons?</q>
Reply, if the perſon holding the eſtate, requires of all, ſomething to be done, in order to their inheriting his eſtate, and he gives the neceſſary aid to ſome to do what he requires, and withholds it from others, in like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he is an odious reſpecter of perſons. And ſuch a one Mr. R. makes the ever glorious GOD to be,

p. 12, 'And where there is a ſimilarity of circumſtances, it is probable, ſome are ſaved, others not.'</p>
            <p>According to Mr. R. thoſe that are ſaved are not one whit better or more deſerving than thoſe that periſh. They were alike in eternity when the decree was made; and as to any difference in time, according to him it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

That reſpect to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is the ſole cauſe of the original choice and all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding favours.</p>
            <p>The excellent Biſhop Hoadly, on terms of acceptance with GOD, p. 302, has this true obſervation,
<q>If virtue be nothing but the irreſiſtable operation of GOD upon us, there can be no reaſon in the world aſſign'd why GOD ſhould hate and puniſh a wicked man and love and reward another: becauſe as to themſelves they are exactly alike. The only difference here ſuppoſed is this, that GOD is pleaſed after an arbitrary manner, to work upon one: and wholly to paſs by the other. If any parent ſhould heap his favours upon one child, and then ſhow the greateſt fondneſs to him, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe favours have been heaped upon him, and abſolutely refuſe to beſtow the leaſt degree of the ſame upon another of his children, and yet hate and puniſh him becauſe he had not what he could not have without his will; would not all the world condemn ſuch a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the moſt partial fondneſs, and the moſt arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proceeding; and attribute it to nothing but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of underſtanding, or ſtrength of paſſion? And yet this is what we are not afraid to lay upon Almighty GOD, when we repreſent him as doing all for ſome, with an irreſiſtable arm, and then loving them for what they have no part in, and on the other ſide, as paſſing by others, and refuſing them the ſame ſtrength without which they cannot move, and yet hateing and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them for not being what they cannot be, and not doing what they cannot do.</q>

chooſe, than to thoſe of them that he paſſed by? And what is this but partiality? And what is it but open barefaced injuſtice to treat thus differently perſons in equal circumſtances?

You deny to man a ſelf determining power with regard to his volitions.

We might it is true, without the implantation of ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in our natures, in conſequence of a chain of exterior cauſes, not within the reach of our controul, be made inſtruments in the production of any effects which are unavoidably connected with their chain of fatality, ſhould even volition or choice be one of its links. But free agents we could not be, and it could never with truth be affirmed of us that we were the producers of theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.

And the very doctrine which Mr. R. labours to palm upon the Bible, under the name of the decree of election, with regard to ſin, he affirms a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine decree and diſpoſal, and a continued ſeries, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſtate in wickedneſs, ending in eternal ruin and deſtruction. p. 16.</p>

And now Sir, I call upon you, with all your Logical and metaphyſical ſkill, to ſhow one of them to be illogical, unfounded, vain and impious; if you can: which when you ſhall have done, I will hold myſelf obliged publickly to acknowledge my miſtake. But here is ſomething that at a diſtance looks like reaſoning, in page 58. I muſt take notice of that as I paſs a long.
<q>If the divine providence can be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, in reſpect to things taking place as they do in fact take place, a divine decree pre-ordaining the taking place of things as they do take place, will be vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of courſe; for the former is a full unanſwerable vindication of the latter.</q>
I will try this reaſoning by a particular inſtance.</p>
            <p>Mr. R. allows that it was refered to Adam to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine his own character and ſtate. But Adam with theſe high powers committed to him did tranſgreſs and eat the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:026990_0078_0FD2B52F6353F9D0"/>
forbidden fruit. Now how can providence be vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuffering this to take place? Eſily as I think, for ſince GOD had made him a moral agent, and ſet life and death before him, and his own choice and conſequent actions were to determine his character and ſtate, it was fit that he ſhould be left to act for himſelf, and unfit that providence ſhould interpoſe to ſtop him, and therefore what GOD could not do; as I have elſewere ſhown. But does this vindication of providence in the taking place of this event, vindicate a divine decree preordaining the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent? By no means. For GOD's decrees are powerful and active, comprehending ſuch means as ſhall unfruſtr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably produce the event decreed. But to affirm this with regard to the firſt tranſgreſſion, is to make GOD the author, and indeed the door of the ſin; and frees Adam from all blame. Thus it appears that providence can be vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in reſpect to things taking place as they do, when a degree preordaining the taking place of things as they do take place, cannot; but would be blaſphemy to affirm. I am ſorry to ſee ſuch ſophiſtry made uſe of, the truth never needs it. Mr. R. tells us p. 58.
<q>If man will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject—let them fault the ſyſtem and not the divine deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.—And evince that ſuch a ſyſtem in the final iſſue is not a good one.</q>
Reply, I have no objections to the divine plan, I believe it wiſe, holy, juſt, and good, But I object to your plan as totally bad, unſcriptural and antiſcriptual, unfit for GOD to reveal or men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And you may be ſure Sir, that diſcourſe contains no part of GOD's plan; if we are to judge of it by God's holy word, to which you refer us. Mr. R. proceeds.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2. We may learn the obligation men are under to admit the doctrine which teaches, that GOD is a ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign in the higheſt ſenſe, an abſolute ſovereign.</q>
That God beſtows original favours in a ſovereign way I have ſhown. But that he diſpenſes rewards and puniſhments in ſuch a way is what I deny; and what Mr. R. can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove.</p>
            <p>He ſays p. 60, that with reſpect to mens eternal ſtate,
<q>Many will admit no ſuch thing as a divine determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpoſal, inſiſting that it is left to men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026990_0079_0FD2B5092163F170"/>
to determine their own character, and fix their own eternal ſtate.</q>
Reply, I have proved that it is left wholly with men to determine their own character and eternal eſtate, you muſt now therefore take back your call for the aſſent of your hearers and readers, to the contrary. Mr. R. proceeds.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>3. We may learn the importance not only of aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the divine ſovereignty, but alſo, of being cordially reconciled to it.</q>
Reply, It is really of importance that we cordially ſubmit, to the ſovereignty of GOD, in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he makes among his creatures; in beſtowing origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal favours. But as ſovereignty has been explained by Mr. R. we never ought to ſubmit to it. Mr. R. tells us,
<q>The wicked at the day of Judgement will without doubt be fully convinced of the truth and juſtice of that ſentence, every mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th be ſtopped, &amp;c.</q>
But why did he not conſider, that his decree of election is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent with a day of Judgement; and with the ſelf condemnation of all thoſe, he tells us were paſſed by from eternity!</p>
            <p>Mr. R. tells us that ſome,
<q>Reſent with acrimony the idea of GOD's determining the character, and diſpoſing of the eternal ſtate of men as he pleaſes. They who do thus are the enemies of GOD.</q>
I am ſorry to ſee ſuch uncharitable judging in this good gentleman; and will impute it rather to his pernicious principles than to his want of a benevolent heart. It is doubtleſs the duty of every man to reject the idea, Mr. R. holds up to view, as infinitely diſhonourable to the ever glorious God, and deſtructive of all religion. Mr. R. proceeds,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <q>4. We may infer, that want of ſubmiſſion to GOD's ſovereignty, and the objections advanced againſt his uncontroulable dominion muſt be owing to ſomething that is criminal and very wrong.</q>
True, if the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of the divine ſovereignty be rightly explained. I have no reaſon to complain becauſe GOD made me a man, and not an Angel; or becauſe he gave my brother five talents, and me but two.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <q>5. We may learn what is neceſſary to remove objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the hearts of men, &amp; effect a real reconciliation
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:026990_0080_0FD2B530C8457E20"/>
to GOD.</q>
Mr. R. goes on to tell us, that this is not to be effected by the,
<q>Propoſal of arguments is and motives, moſt oppoſite and weighty.</q>
But why did not Mr. R. conſider, that in ſaying thus, he reflected upon the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD, in making uſe of this very method, under every diſpenſation, to bring men to be reconciled to himſelf? Reconciliation to GOD, Mr. R. tells us, can be effected no other way but by being <hi>born of God.</hi> I am ſorry he has not told us what he means by being <hi>born of God</hi>; that we might know whether we have any part in it or not. If it is ſomething that belongs wholly to GOD, then we are not to blame that the work is not done; and our being unreconciled is not our fault. Mr. R. proceeds,</p>
            <p n="6">
               <q>6. The ſubject preſents a criterion by which men may try themſelves, and come to know what manner of ſpirit they are of, know their true character and ſtate.</q>
Mr. R. propoſes that we put it to ourſelves, whether it ſeem proper and fit, that GOD ſhould have mercy on whom he will, and harden to their eternal deſtruction whom he will: and whether we are willing to ſubmit all to his arbitrament without any reſervation. To me, this appears a very ſtrange rule of trial. In order to know whether I am reconciled to GOD, I muſt find myſelf wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that my fellow creatures ſhould be eternally deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what is this but having a will oppoſed to the will of GOD, who has declared that he will have all men to be ſaved! That to be reconciled to GOD my will muſt oppoſe GOD's will! But perhaps Mr. R. may intend GOD's decretive, providential will, which according to him is in conſtant oppoſition to his preceptive will! Further Mr. R. would have me be willing to ſubmit all to GOD's arbitrament without any reſervation. If ſo, I ſee not but I muſt be willing to be damned myſelf, as well as have my neighbours damned. Mr. R. ſays, 'At this ſome may boggle.' I do not wonder he thought ſome would boggle. But he goes on to ſay,
<q>If being willing to ſuffer the damnation of hell is implied in a true ſubmiſſion and reconciliation to GOD; ſuch wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs would certainly be right and fit.</q>
Reply,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026990_0081_0FD2B50A8DE7AD58"/>
conſidering what a ſort of creature man is, it is quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that he ſhould be willing to be damned. And if ſuch willingneſs were neceſſary in order to reconciliation to GOD, I ſee not, but it is beſt man never ſhould be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to GOD.</p>
            <p>In p. 66 Mr. R. tells us plainly what he eſteems true ſubmiſſion to GOD.
<q>In true ſubmiſſion men reſolve themſelves into the will of GOD; and make a ſurrender to his diſpoſals with no more than this: it may be he will have mercy, and if he doth not he is perfectly juſt and divinely glorious.</q>
Mr. R. tells us, that it was the will of GOD from eternity, that ſome men ſhould be damned, even all that he paſſed by. To be reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the will of GOD, therefore, according to him, does imply, 1ſt. That I am willing that ſome of my fellow creatures ſhould be damned. 2d. That I am willing to be damned myſelf upon it ſo falling out, that I am one that was paſſed by. But is this right? muſt I be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that thoſe for whom Chriſt died ſhould be damned eternally? That thoſe whom GOD will have to be ſaved ſhould be damned eternally? How does this agree with my duty to love and pray for all? And as to being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be damned myſelf, 'tis the ſame as to be willing to oppoſe the will of GOD and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Mr. R. tells me that in true ſubmiſſion I muſt ſay that GOD is perfectly juſt, though he doth not have mercy on me. At this I ſhall certainly 'boggle.' For I do not ſee it to be equitable, that ſuch a difference ſhould be made, by the great parent of all between the children of his family, and where there is no equity, there is no juſtice. I believe it to be unjuſt and cruel in the higheſt degree, to chooſe one and paſs by another, as Mr. R. tells us GOD did from eternity. But bleſſed be GOD we have no evidence of ſuch a decree of election but Mr. R's word; which we count not worth a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ruſh, in this caſe. As to what Mr. R. ſays, about our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the matter of our ſalvation to GOD, I think he is wholly wrong. When we pray for earthly good things, as food, friends, &amp;c. we ought to pray for theſe with ſubmiſſion to the will of GOD; becauſe GOD has
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:026990_0082_0FD2B532BADEC530"/>
not made his will known to us in theſe matters, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than in general terms; we ought therefore, to refer ourſelves to the will, wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD, to be dealt with as he ſees beſt for us, in our preſent ſtate of education. But not ſo with regard to eternal life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe GOD has expreſsly told us that it is his will we we ſhould have eternal life. To pray therefore for this with ſubmiſſion as for earthly good things would be to call in queſtion the truth of GOD's word, which declares GOD willing the ſalvation of all men. In prayer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to conſider eternal ſalvation as what GOD wills we ſhould have, and what his grace has brought to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, and what no man can miſs of upon any other terms but his own putting of it away from him. Upon the whole, it is my opinion, that what Mr. R. calls a true ſubmiſſion to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is what would be very wrong, wicked and ſinful for any man to make. As to what Mr. R. has ſaid about an eternal refuſal to ſubmit to GOD, belonging to the character and ſtate of the damned, who he ſays will be the eternal enemies of GOD. I freely own I do not believe it. But be it ſo, according to Mr. R. this is agreeable to the will of GOD! But I would pray him to conſider how he can reconcile this opinion of his, to the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. xv. 26, The laſt enemy ſhall be deſtroyed, death.</p>
            <p>Mr. R's diſcourſe cloſes with a word of advice to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſinners, the ſelf righteous and awakened ſinners. I wonder the good gentleman did not conſider, that if he was ever aſked a reaſon for this, he muſt be ſilent, or do worſe. Pray ſir, how could you be ſo cruel to profane ſinners, as to try to terrify them with fear of hell, when you know their ſtate was determined from eternity. And in this diſcourſe you declare that no ſtate of mind has the leaſt influence in the divine determination reſpecting the beſtowment of mercy? How could you go about to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify and trouble the ſelf-righteous, when certainly ſelf-righteouſneſs is better than no righteouſneſs, and you know that no righteouſneſs can break up GOD's eternal decrees? How could you caution awakened ſinners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt deluſions and miſtakes, as though they were in
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:026990_0083_0FD2B50C9DF12170"/>
danger from theſe? When you know, that all that GOD choſe from eternity muſt be ſaved, and all he paſſed by muſt periſh? Had you been conſiſtent with your ſelf, you would have told the profane, never to admit fear or care about their future ſtate. The ſelf righteous, to perſevere in their ſelf righteouſneſs, as it was good and profitable unto men. And the awakened you would have ſoothed as much as poſſible, and plainly told them that their fears were quite fruitleſs.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. I ſhall conclude as propoſed by a letter to the Rev. Mr. ROBBINS.</p>
            <p>REV. SIR, as you ſubmitted your diſcourſe, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic inſpection, you will not be offended with me that I have examined it. Had I not Judged upon reading of it, that it was moſt diſhonorable to GOD, injurious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and greatly encouraging ſin, I had not taken ſuch notice of it as I have. I have conſtantly endeavoured to underſtand your true meaning; and am not ſenſible that I have in any inſtance miſtaken it. I am a total ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to you, otherwiſe than by reading the diſcourſe that is now before me. Moſt certainly Sir I read your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe without any prejudice againſt your perſon. But perhaps two men profeſſing Chriſtianity never thought more differently from each other than we do. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I look upon your diſcourſe, taken connectively as not containing one word of truth in it; yet I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to conſider you ſir, as one that truly fears GOD, loves the truth and would knowingly do nothing againſt it. Dr. Williams ſays of Dr. Criſp, that he believes he was a pious and Godly man: that his life was a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his doctrines; that the grace of GOD preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his heart from being corrupted, by his wicked blaſphemous opinions. I am willing to have the ſame opinion dear ſir, of you; and would treat you accordingly. We are here in a dark ſtate, and know but in part; I would ever be jealous of myſelf, that I may be wrong, willing to ſee my own miſtakes, and make all charitable allowance for the miſtakes of my brethren. I am ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that you think, or did when you publiſhed, that your opinion was right and would bear examination: For
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:026990_0084_0FD2B533D88E2200"/>
otherwiſe you would not have ſubmitted it to public inſpection; in a day ſo remarkable as this for free en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry. Pious frauds will no longer do, myſtical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity is going out of vogue; and men inſiſt now upon plain common ſenſe. Had your diſcourſe been publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a hundred years ago, a great part of the Divines called Calviniſtical would have diſliked it, on account of its making GOD the author of ſin; which although it was Calvin's opinion, yet it has not been univerſally acknowledged by his followers. But there is but little compariſon between the light enjoyed one hundred years ago, and the light we enjoy.</p>
            <p>We now clearly ſee that all the old creeds, conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of faith &amp;c. are wrong. That to have a diſcourſe like yours come abroad, in a day like ours, for light and liberty, is ſtrange indeed. Men in our nation have too high a ſenſe of their liberty, to ſubmit to doctrine that ſets them upon a level with the brutal creation. Such doctrine will do among ſlaves, but not among freemen. You could not expect that any, who knew what it was to be men, or ſinners; would ever approve of your doctrine. A doctrine which degrades men into brutes, and makes ſin impoſſible to them. I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thought, that the goodneſs of GOD is to be admired, in ſo ordering of it, that men think nearly as differently from each other as they look: as hereby they are render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much the more neceſſary and uſeful to each other, and have the nobleſt opportunity for the exerciſe of char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. But it will be thought ſtrange that men devoted to ſtudy, ſhould be ſo extremely wide of each other as we are. And to what can this great difference be attributed, unleſs one or the other of us, have been hampered with a ſyſtem? And ſo have ſtudied rather to defend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we took for truth, without due examination; than to find out what was true.</p>
            <p>You may, dear ſir, think that I am blinded by bigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and ſee only with the eyes of others: but I think none acquainted with me, will have that opinion of me. For thirty years paſt, I have ſtudied without ſhackles, as I think; fully convinced that the truth was not to be
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:026990_0085_0FD2B50D8C24EEB8"/>
found among the ſavings of men; but is rooted in things, I have ſought it where, as I apprehend it is only to be found. And when I have diſcovered it at any time, I have not been afraid to make it known for the good of others; however contrary to prevailing opinions. But do my dear brother, give me leave, without offence, to tell you, that I fear you have taken opinions too much upon truſt; and have layed too much weight upon the ſayings of men. If not, how could one of your diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo miſtake the meaning of the ſcripture you founded your diſcourſe upon? How could you conſider ſin as the effect of the will and agency of GOD? What! ſin the choice of that being who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity! I have heard it ſcoffingly ſaid, that 'tis an article of faith in Connecticut, that GOD is the author of ſin. Becauſe the confeſſion of faith adopted by the elders and meſſengers of the Churches, aſſembled at Saybrook, 1708, ſays, GOD's determinate counſel exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth itſelf even to the firſt fall, and all other ſins of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men, and that not by a bare permiſſion. But I did not think, 'till I read your diſcourſe, that there was a miniſter now in the State that would avow that blaſphemous ſentiment.</p>
            <p>How could you ſay that GOD orders the occaſion, and withholds influence neceſſary to prevent ſin? which makes ſin neceſſary, and lays the blame at GOD's door! For a deficient cauſe in things neceſſary, is truely effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
            <p>How could you ſo limit the knowledge of the Deity, as to ſuppoſe things properly contingent unknowable to him? Surely all things are done contingently in reſpect to GOD, which for ought he hath decreed, might with as much poſſibility not be as be. But all things which are done by the creatures voluntarily, may as well not be done, as done. Therefore, if GOD hath decreed, that many things ſhould be done voluntarily, he hath decreed, that they ſhould be done contingently. The minor is evident, becauſe, if the creatures may not as well omit them as do them, they do them not voluntarily, but neceſſarily. How could you charge ſin and blame upon
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:026990_0086_0FD2B537C5188CD8"/>
men, meerly for acting voluntarily in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which is evil? Surely the prerogative of a voluntary agent conſiſteth not in doing that which it deſireth to do; but in liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of choice to do or not to do, this or that, not in free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from coercion only, but in freedom from neceſſity alſo. How could you argue from the neceſſary holineſs of GOD, that neceſſity may conſiſt with liberty among men; ſince he is above and out of all predicaments wherein we are. How could you argue from GOD's right and propriety in all things, that it belongs to him to diſpoſe of the eternal ſtate of men; in ſin and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to his good pleaſure? we know that by GOD's abſolute and naked power, he can caſt away the whole maſs of mankind; it is not repugnant to ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty: but by that actual power of his, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways clothed with goodneſs and juſtice, he cannot of his pleaſure caſt away one. How could you ſay, that all men being ſinners, GOD is not obliged to exerciſe his ſaving mercy towards any? Is he not bound by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, by his promiſe, and by his giving ſinners of men a law to keep?</p>
            <p>How could you adopt the opinion of abſolute elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reprobation? an opinion which drags after it the moſt abſurd, wicked and blaſphemous conſequences. Abſolute reprobation being once granted, we may more properly call GOD a father of cruelties, than of mercies; and of hatred rather than of love; and a deſtroyer of men, rather than the ſaviour of men. Mr. Fletcher, illuſtrates this, by a mother that "conceived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable antipathy to her ſucking child. She goes to the brink of a precipice, bends herſelf over it with the paſſive infant in her boſom, and, withdrawing her arms from under him, drops him upon the craggy ſide of a rock, and thus he rolls down from rock to rock, 'till he lies at the bottom beaten to pieces, a bloody inſtance of finiſhed deſtruction. The Judge aſks the murderer what ſhe has to ſay in her own defence. The child was mine, replies ſhe, and I have a right to do what I pleaſe with my own. Beſides, I did neither throw him down, nor murder him: I only withdrew my arms from under

him, and he fell of his own accord." Upon your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſir, this mother muſt be acquitted with honour; but common ſenſe will condemn the murderer. Theſe and many other, like ſentiments in your diſcourſe, ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied me that a gentleman of your diſcerning, would never embrace ſuch opinions, had not your mind been warp'd by the opinions of others. Hence I concluded on reading your diſcourſe, that you was defending the opinions of other men rather than your own. And ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral words and phraſes in your diſcourſe, which I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, made me think that you had been miſlead by Mr. Edwards' treatiſe on the will; than which I know of no book, where ſo much labour and pains is taken to ſo little purpoſe. I own the book, but have it not now by me, if I had, I would give you a confutation of it in one page, though, as I remember it contains near four hundred. But you may find the ſinews of Mr. Edwards' arguments out by the ingenious Mr. Weſt of Newbedford; in an eſſay on liberty and neceſſity, lately publiſhed. What conceivable abſurdity dear ſir, can be more ſhocking to the human mind, not corrupted with a falſe glare of vain ſcience, than for men to commend or blame themſelves, or for others to do it, for what they are no more the cauſes of, than of the beating of their pulſe, and could no more prevent than the ebbing and flowing of the ſea! This plan of fataliſm which Mr. Edwards pleads for, and which you have adopted; is wholly the product of metaphyſical ſubtility; and in direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the invariable conſciouſneſs mankind have of a power within themſelves to give motion to the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties both of their ſouls and bodies. Nay, even thoſe who pretend to believe the doctrine of fatal cauſalty, directly contradict, by their practical ſentiments, and in a ſteady uniform courſe, what they poſſeſs in words. For their whole conduct in life is juſt as theirs is, who really think they are poſſeſſed of an active ſelf-moving power, and are the cauſes of their own volitions, and the effects conſequent upon them. So their practice in life is a confutation of their faith in theory. I beſeech you my dear brother to review your whole ſcheme, turn it upon

all ſides, trace it in all its conſequences; and ſee where and to what they will lead you.</p>
            <p>I have paſſed over in ſilence many things exception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in your diſcourſe, becauſe I would not be tedious. And things that I have a little examined, I have not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued in there conſequences as I might have done. Read dear Sir, the remarks I have made on your diſcourſe, in the ſpirit of love. Be aſſured that your opponent is not your enemy. If any thing juſtly offenſive has eſcaped my pen, I will certainly retract it the moment I ſee it. If after all you remain of the ſame mind, as when you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed your diſcourſe, you will doubtleſs think that there is ſomething neceſſary now for you to do; in order to defend your diſcourſe, againſt the exceptions I have made to it. I am quite willing you ſhould do your utmoſt to defend your ſcheme. But you know my dear brother, that there is a certain number of firſt principles, or primary moral truths, which are perceived and aſſented to, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heſitation, by mankind in common; in conſequence of that power of diſcernment they come into being furn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed with, and are the only baſis on which there can be reaſoning to any purpoſe among men, with relation to the moral ſyſtem. Hence, the further any one proceeds in error the further he departs from thoſe primary truths, which form the baſis of reaſoning and conſequently will be the more eaſily detected. If it is my caſe, that I am in the wrong, as you may likely think; the further I go the weaker I ſhall grow. And at length become a very eaſy tool to deal with. Should this be the caſe, I will rejoice, may the truth but grain ground.</p>
            <p>Controverſy, though not deſirable in it ſelf, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly managed, has often times reſcued truth groaning under the laſh of triumphant error. To pay a ſtrict at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the thing, or object in diſpute, and uſe no other artillery againſt an adverſary, than ſoft words and hard arguments, is generally the beſt way to manage a diſpute. If you ſhould write again in defence of your ſcheme, whatever you advance, that is argumentative and to the point, you may depend upon my careful, and I hope candid examination; ſhould it pleaſe GOD to ſpare life
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:026990_0089_0FD2B53C0F5648E8"/>
and continue health. But any thing that is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhall treat with ſilence.</p>
            <p>But as wide as we now are in opinion from each other, what hinders our being one in love? Let us my dear brother, notwithſtanding our difference in opinion, love one another out of a pure heart fervently, as the goſpel of Chriſt directs. Conſtantly praying for each other, that the GOD of patience and conſolation would grant us to be like minded, one towards another according to Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
