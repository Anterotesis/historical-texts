            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>SINCE the name firſt came abroad into the world, many have been at a loſs to know what a methodiſt is: what are the principles and the practice of thoſe, who are commonly called by that name; and what the diſtinguiſhing marks of this ſect, which is every where ſpoken againſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it being generally believed, that I was able to give the cleareſt account of theſe things (as having been one of the firſt to whom that name was given, and the perſon by whom the reſt were ſuppoſed to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected) I have been called upon, in all manner of ways, and with the utmoſt earneſtneſs, ſo to do. I yield at laſt to the continued importunity both of friends and enemies; and do now give the cleareſt account I can, in the preſence of the Lord and Judge of heaven and earth, of the principles and practice whereby thoſe who are called methodiſts, are diſtinguiſhed from other men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſay thoſe who are called methodiſts; for let it be well obſerved, that this is not a name which they take to themſelves, but one fixt upon them by way of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:026460_0003_0FD0512F154728A8"/>reproach, without their approbation or conſent. It was firſt given to three or four young men at Oxford, by a ſtudent of Chriſt Church: either in alluſion to the antient ſect of phyſicians ſo called from their reaching, that almoſt all diſeaſes might be cured by ſpecific me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of diet and exerciſe, or from their obſerving a more regular method of ſtudy and behaviour, than was uſual with thoſe of their age and ſtation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I ſhould rejoice (ſo little ambitions am I to be at the head of any ſect or party) if the very name might never be mentioned more, but be buried in eternal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion. But if that cannot be, at leaſt let thoſe who will uſe it, know the meaning of the word they uſe. Let us not always be fighting in the dark. Come, and let us look one another in the face. And perhaps ſome of you who hate what I am called, may love what I am (by the grace of God:) or, rather what I follow after, if that I may apprehend that, for which alſo I am ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

            <head>The Character of a Methodiſt.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THE diſtinguiſhing marks of a methodiſt are not his opinions of any ſort. His aſſenting to this or that ſcheme of religion, his embracing any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſet of notions, his eſpouſing the judgment of one man or of another, are all quite wide of the point. Whoſoever therefore imagines, that a methodiſt is, a man of ſuch or ſuch an opinion is groſsly ignorant of the whole affair, he miſtakes the truth totally. We believe indeed, that all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God; and herein we are diſtinguiſhed from Jews, Turks, and Infidels. We believe the written word of God to be the only and ſufficient rule, both of chriſtian faith and practice; and herein we are fundamentally diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thoſe of the Romiſh church. We believe Chriſt to be the eternal ſupreme God, and herein are we diſtinguiſhed from the Socinians and Arians. But as to all opinions which do not ſtrike at the root of chriſtianity, we think and let think. So that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, whether right or wrong, they are no diſtinguiſhing marks of a methodiſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither are words or phraſes of any ſort. We do not place our religion, or any part of it, in being attached to any peculiar mode of ſpeaking, any quaint or uncommon ſet of expreſſions. The moſt obvious, eaſy, common words, wherein our meaning can be conveyed, we prefer before others, both ordinary occaſions, and when we ſpeak of the things of God. We never therefore willingly or deſignedly deviate from the moſt uſual way of ſpeaking; unleſs when we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſcripture truths, in ſcripture words, (which we preſume no chriſtian will condemn) neither do we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to uſe any particular expreſſions of ſcripture, more frequently than others, unleſs they are ſuch as are frequently uſed by the inſpired writers themſelves. So that it is as groſs an error, to place the marks of a methodiſt in his words, as in opinions of any ſort.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:026460_0005_0FD051318F5429F0"/>
3. Nor do we deſire to be diſtinguiſhed by actions, cuſtoms, or uſages, of an indifferent nature. Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion does not he in doing what God has not enjoined, or abſtaining from what he hath not forbidden. It does not lie in the form of our apparel, in the poſture of our body, or the covering of our heads; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> abſtaining from marriage, nor from meats <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, which are all good if received with thankſgiving. Therefore neither will any man who knows whereof he affirms, ſix the mark of a methodiſt here; in any actions or cuſtoms purely indifferent, undetermined by the word of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor, laſtly, is he to be diſtinguiſhed by laying the whole ſtreſs of religion on any ſingle part or it. If you ſay, "Yes, he is; for he thinks we are ſaved by faith alone:" I anſwer, you do not underſtand the terms. By ſalvation he means holineſs of heart and life. And this he affirms to ſpring from true faith alone. Can even a nominal chriſtian deny it? Is this placing a part of religion for the whole? Do we then make void the law thro' faith? God forbid! Yea we eſtabliſh the law. We do not place the whole of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as too many do, God knoweth) either in doing no harm or in doing good, or in uſing the ordinances of God. No, nor in all of them together; wherein we know by experience a man may labour many years, and at the end have no true religion at all, no more than he had at the begining. Much leſs in any one of theſe; or, it may be in a ſcrap of one of them: like her who fancies herſelf a virtuous woman, only becauſe the is not a proſtitute; or him who dreams he is an honeſt man, merely becauſe he does not rob or ſteal. May the Lord God of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> preſerve me, from ſuch a poor, ſtarved religion as this! were this the mark of a metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt, I would ſoones chuſe to be a ſincere Jew, Turk, or Pagan.</p>
            <p n="5">5. "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> then is the mark? Who is a methodiſt according to your own account?" I anſwer: A metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026460_0006_0FD051330EEE47E8"/>is one, who has the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart, by the Holy Ghoſt given unto him: one who loves the Lord his God with all his heart, and with all his ſoul, and with all his mind, and with all his ſtrength. God is the joy of his heart, and the deſire of his ſoul; which is conſtantly crying out, "Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſide thee! My God and my all! Thou art the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver!"</p>
            <p n="6">6. He is therefore happy in God, yea, always hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as having in him a well of water, ſpringing up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting life, and overflowing his ſoul with peace and joy. Perfect love having now caſt out fear, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joices evermore. He rejoices in the Lord always, even in God his Saviour: And in the Father, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom he hath now received the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

7. And he who hath this hope thus full of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, in every thing giveth thanks: as knowing that this (whatſoever it is) is the will of God in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus concerning him. From him therefore he chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully receives all, ſaying, Good is the will of the Lord: and whether the Lord giveth or taketh away, equally bleſſing the name of the Lord. For he hath learned in whatſoever ſtate he is therewith to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. He knoweth both how to be abaſed and how to abound. Every where and in all things he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound and ſuffer need, whether in eaſe or pain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſickneſs or health, whether in life or death, he giveth thanks from the ground of the heart to him who order it for good: Knowing that as every good gift cometh from above, ſo none but good can come from the father of lights, into whoſe hands he has wholly committed his body and ſoul, as into the hands of a faitful creator. He is therefore careful (anxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or uneaſily careful) for nothing: As having caſt all his care on him that careth for him, and in all things reſting on him, after making his requeſt known to him with thankſgiving.</p>
            <p n="8">8. For indeed he prays without ceaſing. It is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him always to pray and not to faint. Not that he is always in the houſe of prayer; though he neglects no opportunity of being there. Neither is he always on his knees, although he often is, or on his face, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord his God. Nor yet is he always crying aloud to God, or calling upon him in words. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the ſpirit maketh interceſſion for him with groans that cannot be uttered: but at all times the language of his heart is this, "Thou brightneſs of the eternal glory, unto thee is my mouth, though without a voice, and my ſilence ſpeaketh unto thee." And this is true prayer, the lifting up the heart to God. This is the eſſence of prayer, and this alone. But his heart is ever lifted up to God, and at all times
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026460_0008_0FD05136AE5B3000"/>and in all places. In this he is never hindered, much leſs interrupted by any perſon or thing. In retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on company, in leiſure, buſineſs or converſation his heart is ever with the Lord. Whether he lie down or riſe up, God is in all his thoughts; he walks with God continually, having the loving eye of his mind ſtill fixed upon him, and every where ſeeing him that is inviſible.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And while he thus always exerciſes his love to God, by praying without ceaſing, rejoicing evermore, and in every thing giving thanks, this commandment is written in his heart, that he who loveth God, loves his brother alſo. And he accordingly loves his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as himſelf; he loves every man as his own ſoul. His heart is full of love to all mankind, to every child of the father of the ſpirits of all fleſh. That a man is not perſonally known to him is no bar to his love: No, nor that he is known to be ſuch as he approves not, that he repays hatred for his good-will. For he loves his enemies, yea, and the enemies of God, the evil and the unthankful. And if it be not in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do good to them that hate him, yet he ceaſes not to pray for them, though they continue to ſpurn his love, and ſtill deſpitefully uſe him and perſecute him.</p>
            <p n="10">10. For he is pure in heart. The love of God has purified his heart from all revengeful paſſions, from envy, malice, and wrath; from every unkind temper or malign affection. It hath cleanſed him from pride and haughtineſs of ſpirit, whereof alone cometh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. And he hath now put on bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering; ſo that he forbears and forgives, if he had a quarrel againſt any; even as God in Chriſt hath forgiven him. And indeed all poſſible ground for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, on his part, is utterly cut off. For none can take from him what he deſires; ſeeing he loves not the world, nor any of the things of the world; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026460_0009_0FD051378DDCF340"/>now crucified to the world, and the world crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him; being dead to all that is in the world, both to the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life. For all his deſire is unto God, and to the remembrance of his name.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Agreeable to this his one deſire, is the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his life, namely, not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him. His one intention at all times and in all things is, not to pleaſe himſelf, but him whom his ſoul loveth. He has a ſingle eye. And becauſe his eye is ſingle, his whole body is full of light. Indeed where the loving eye of the ſoul is continually fixed upon God, there can be no darkneſs at all, but the whole is light; as when the bright ſhining of a candle doth enlighten the houſe. God then reigns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. All that is in the ſoul is holineſs to the Lord. There is not a motion in his heart, but is according to his will. Every thought that ariſes points to him, and is in obedience to the law of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And the tree is known by its fruits. For as he loves God, ſo he keeps his commandments. Not only ſome, or moſt of them, but all, from the leaſt to the greateſt. He is not content to keep the whole law, and offend in one point; but has in all points, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience void of offence, towards God and towards man. Whatever God has forbidden, he avoids; whatever God hath enjoin'd he doth; and that whether it be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or great, hard or eaſy, joyous or grievous to the fleſh. He runs the ways of God's commandments, now he hath ſet his heart at liberty. It is his glory ſo to do; it is his daily crown of rejoycing, To do the will of God on earth, as it is done in heaven; knowing it is the higheſt privilege of the angels of God, of thoſe that excel in ſtrength, to fulfil his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments and hearken to the voice of his word.</p>
            <p n="13">13. All the commandments of God he accordingly keeps, and that with all his might. For his obedience is in proportion to his love, the ſource from whence it
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026460_0010_0FD051390FC4A6D0"/>flows. And therefore, loving God with all his heart, he ſerves him with all his ſtrength. He continually preſents his ſoul and body, a living ſacrifice, holy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God; entirely and without reſerve devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf, all he has, and all he is, to his glory. All the talents he has received, he conſtantly employs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his maſter's will; every power and faculty of his ſoul, every member of his body. Once he yielded them unto ſin and the devil, as inſtruments of unrighteouſneſs; but now, being alive from the dead, he yields them all, as inſtruments of righteouſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
            <p n="14">14. By conſequence, whatſoever he doth, it is all to the glory of God. In all his employments of every kind, he not only aims at this, (which is implied in having a ſingle eye) but actually attains it. His bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and refreſhments as well as his prayers, all ſerve to this great end. Whether he ſit in his houſe, or walk by the way, whether he lie down or riſe up, he is promoting in all he ſpeaks or does, the one buſineſs of his life; whether he put on his apparel, or labour or eat and drink, or divert himſelf from too waſting la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it all tends to advance the glory of God, by peace and good-will among men. His one invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rule is this, Whatever ye do in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jeſus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Nor do the cuſtoms of the world at all hinder his running the race that is ſet before him. He knows that vice does not loſe it nature, though it becomes ever ſo faſhionable; and remembers, that every man is to give an account of himſelf to God. He cannot therefore, even follow a multitude to do evil. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fare ſumptuouſly every day, or make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof. He cannot lay up treaſures upon earth, no more than he can take fire into his boſom. He cannot adorn himſelf (on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence) with gold or coſtly apparel, he cannot join in,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026460_0011_0FD0513A8D7B5310"/>or countenance any diverſion, which has the leaſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to vice, of any kind. He cannot ſpeak evil of his neighbour no more than he can lie, either for God or man. He cannot utter an unkind word of any one; for love keeps the door of his lips. He cannot ſpeak idle words. No corrupt communication ever comes out of his mouth, as is all that which is not good, to the uſe of edifying, not fit to miniſter grace to the hearers. But whatſover things, are pure, whatſover things are lovely, whatſoever things are juſtly of good report, he thinks and ſpeaks, and acts, adorning the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in all things.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Laſtly, as he has time, he does good unto all men; unto neighbours and ſtrangers, friends and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. And that in every poſſible kind; not only to their bodies by feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitting thoſe that are ſick or in priſon; but much more does he labour to do good to their ſouls, as of the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which God giveth: to awaken thoſe that ſleep in death; to bring thoſe who are awakened to the aton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood, that being juſtified by faith, they may have peace with God, and to provoke thoſe who have peace with God, to abound more in love and in good works. And he is willing to ſpend and be ſpent herein, even to be offered up on the ſacrifice and ſervice of their faith, ſo they may all come unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fullneſs of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Theſe are the principles and practices of our ſect, theſe are the marks of a true methodiſt. By theſe alone do thoſe who are in deriſion ſo called, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be diſtinguiſhed from other men. If any man ſay "Why theſe are only the common, fundamental principles of chriſtianity!" Thou haſt ſaid; So I mean; this is the very truth; I know they are no other; and I would to God both thouſand all men knew, that I, and all who follow my judgment, do ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently refuſe to be diſtinguiſhed from other men, by any but the common principles of chriſtianity. The plain, old chriſtianity that I teach, renouncing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026460_0012_0FD0513C0C0D1928"/>all other marks of diſtinction. And whoſoever <hi>is</hi> that I <hi>preach</hi> (let him be called what he will; for names change not the nature of things) he is a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian not in name only, but in heart and in life. He has inwardly and outwardly conformed to the will of God, as revealed in the written word. He thinks ſpeaks, and lives according to the method laid down in the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt. His ſoul is renewed after the image of God, in righteouſneſs and in all true holineſs. And having the mind that was in Chriſt he ſo walks as Chriſt alſo walked.</p>
            <p n="18">18. By theſe marks, by theſe fruits of a living faith do we labour to diſtinguiſh ourſelves from the unbelieving world, from all thoſe whoſe minds or lives are not according to the goſpel of Chriſt. But from real chriſtians of whatſoever denomination they be, we earneſtly deſire not to be diſtinguiſhed at all: Not from any, who ſincerely follow after what they know they have not yet attained. No: whoſoever doth the will of my Father which is in heaven, the ſame is my brother, and ſiſter and mother. And I beſeech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that we be in no wiſe divided among ourſelves. Is thy heart right, as my heart is with thine? I aſk no farther queſtion. If it be, give me thy hand. For opinions or terms, let us not deſtroy the work of God. Doſt thou love and ſerve God! it is enough. I give thee the right-hand of fellowſhip. If there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort of love, if any fellowſhip of the ſpirit, if any bowels and mercies. Let us ſtrive together for the faith of the goſpel; walking worthy of the vocation wherewith we are called; with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another in love, and endeavouring to keep the unity of the ſpirit, in the bond of peace: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, there is one body and one ſpirit, even as we are called with one hope of our calling: One Lord, one faith, one baptiſm; One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all!</p>
