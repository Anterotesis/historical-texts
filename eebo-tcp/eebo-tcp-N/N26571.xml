         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INDIANS. A TALE.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <l>In pity come, and eaſe my grief,</l>
                  <l>Bring my diſtemper'd ſoul relief.</l>
               </q>

            <p>MARANO, amiable in her ſorrow, ſat alone by a ſhelving rock. She ſought in ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to indulge the anguiſh of her ſoul. She leaned penſive on her arm. Her treſſes flowed careleſs to the gale. The blooming beauty of her complexion was fluſhed with weeping. Her eyes were full of tender anxiety. And her boſom heaved with repeated ſighs.</p>
            <p>'When will he return?' ſhe ſaid,
<q>my beloved Oneyo! the huſband of my affections! How I long to behold him! ye waves of Ontario convey him to his native ſhore; reſtore him to his friends; reſtore him to my tender embrace. O when ſhall I behold him? when will the ſwift canoe come bounding over the lake, and waft the hero to his gladſome iſle! Yes, thou happy iſle! thy rocks, thy reſounding glades, and thy foreſts ſhall then rejoice. Gladneſs ſhall then be in the village. The Elders ſhall come forth to receive him. The feſtival ſhall be prepared.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035333_0009_10022EA1D5C46EF8"/>
Ah me! peradventure he hath periſhed! Or now expires in ſome bloody field! impetuous in his valour, and eager in the ardour of youth, perchance he ruſhes on the foe and falls!</q>
While Marano thus indulged her inquietude, the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ononthio was drawing nigh to conſole her. He had perceived the uneaſineſs of her ſoul, and had followed her from the village. He was the father of Oneyo, one of the Elders of the nation, revered for his wiſdom, and beloved for his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. He loved Marano with the affection of a father. 'Be comforted,' he ſaid,
<q>give not thy ſoul to deſpair. The great ſpirit, who rides in the whirlwind, and ſpeaks from the paſſing thunder, will protect thee. But to merit his favour, be reſigned to his will. It is impious to anticipate miſery, and render ourſelves unhappy before we are actually afflicted. Be comforted. Oneyo may ſoon return loaded with the ſpoils of the Briton, and extolled by the gallant warriors of France.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'To ſee my huſband return in ſafety,' ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<q>is the ſum of my deſires. To ſee him loaded with the ſpoils of the Briton will be no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to my joy.</q>
The Indian ſeemed aſtoniſhed. 'Have you forgotten,' ſhe continued,
<q>that I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf am a Briton that I was carried violently from my father's houſe, when the Outagami rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged our land, and carried terror to the gates of Albany? My parents periſhed. I was yet a child; but I remember the bloody carnage. My brother of riper years, was reſcued; but I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035333_0010_10022EA42348DA28"/>
became the prey of their fury. Since that time, many years are elapſed; yet at the name of Briton my boſom glows with peculiar tranſport.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'I fondly imagined,' anſwered the Indian,
<q>that you loved us. We named you after the manner of our tribe. But your affections are eſtranged, and you languiſh for the land of your fathers. I called you my daughter—but, Marano you would leave me.</q>
Uttering theſe words, he looked tenderly upon her.
<q>You would leave me,</q>
he repeated, and a tear roſe in his eye. Marano was affected. She claſped his hand, and preſſed it to her roſy lips.
<q>No, I will never leave thee. My heart is thine, and my beloved Oneyo's. I revere thee. Can I forget thy compaſſion? Can I forget the dreadful day when the Outagami, in an aſſembly of their nation, decreed me a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their god Areſkoui. You was preſent on an embaſſy from your people. Oneyo in the bloom of years accompanied his father. He was beſide you. He ſighed, when he beheld me weeping. Alas! I was feeble, friendleſs, and beſet with ſoes. Oneyo intreated you to relieve me. Your own heart was affected; you inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in my behalf; you redeemed me, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me your's. Oneyo haſted to my deliverance; he looſened my ſetters, and claſped me to his breaſt. Our affection grew with our years. You beheld it with kind indulgence, and ratified our wiſhes with your conſent. I have heard of European refinements, of coſtly raiment, and lofty palaces; yet to me the ſimplicity of theſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035333_0011_10022EA6703AB5D0"/>
rocks and foreſts ſeem far more delightful. But if Oneyo returns not, I am undone. Many moons have ariſen ſince. With the flower of our tribe, he departed. The matrons are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wailing for their ſons.—Oneyo, alas! is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous, and if he has fallen, grief will ſubdue thee; I know the tenderneſs of thine affection; it will pull thee down to the grave. Who then will be my friend? Among a ſtrange people, I have no father to protect me, no brother to counſel or give me aid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Ononthio was about to reply, when an Indian from the village accoſted them. He told them, with a ſorrowful aſpect, that the hopes of their tribe were blaſted, for that ſome Indians of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring nation, having returned from Canada, brought certain intelligence of the total overthrow of their friends; that they had, with difficulty, eſcaped; that Oneyo was ſeen fierce and intrepid in the heat of the battle; that he was ſurrounded by the foe, and muſt have fallen a victim to their fury.</p>
            <p>Marano was overwhelmed. Ononthio heaved a ſigh: but the hapleſs condition of his daughter, and the deſire of yielding her conſolation, ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and relieved his ſorrow.
<q>If my ſon has fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</q>
he ſaid,
<q>he has fallen as became a warrior. His praiſe ſhall be preſerved by his kindred and deſcend to poſterity in the war ſong. His name ſhall terrify the European, when the chieftains of future times, ruſhing fierce from their foreſts, ſhall ſurround his habitation at midnight, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035333_0012_10022EA80268FD38"/>
raiſe the yell of death in his ear. Oneyo ſhall not die unrevenged.</q>
'He ſhall not,' interrupted the Indian.
<q>The meſſingers of our misfortune hovered around the walls of Quebec. They ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed a party of the foe, they have brought them captives to our Iſland; the Elders of our nation are now aſſembled; they have doomed them a ſacrifice to the memory of the dead; and defer their execution, only till your arrival.</q>
'Alas!' ſaid Marano,
<q>the ſacrafice of a captive will afford me ſmall conſolation. Will the death of a foe reſtore life to my huſband? or heal his ghaſtly wounds? or reanimate his breathleſs boſom? Leave me to my woe. Leave me to wail on theſe lonely mountains. Here I will not long be a ſojourner. I will away to my love. I will meet him beyond the deſerts, in ſome bliſsful valley, where no bloody foe ſhall invade us. Leave me to my ſorrow; for I will not live.</q>
She intreated in vain. The Indian was urgent, and Ononthio ſeconded his ſolicitation.</p>
            <p>That nation of Indians, of which Oneyo was a leader, inhabited an Iſland in the Lake Ontario. They were, therefore, no ſooner informed of the death of Oneyo, and of their brethren, than they abandoned themſelves to loud lamentations. The matrons with rent garments and disſhevelled treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ran forth into the fields, and filled the air with their wailing. They then crowded around the captives, whom, in the bitterneſs of their woe, they loaded with keen invectives. The Elders were aſſembled; the boiling caldron into which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035333_0013_10022EA99015BCA0"/>
the victims, after ſuffering every ſpecies of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were to be precipitated, was ſuſpended over a raging fire; the knives, tomahawks, and other implements of cruelty, were exhibited in dreadful array; and the priſoners, loaded with heavy fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, were conducted to the place of ſacrifice.</p>
            <p>Though Marano was deeply afflicted, the ſcreams of the Indians, and the horrid prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of torture, drew her attention to the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. She regarded them with an eye of pity. Their leader, in the prime of youth, was comely, vigorous, and graceful. The ſullenneſs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted and indignant valour was portrayed by nature in his fearleſs aſpect. His eye, full of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and invincible firmneſs, ſurveyed the prep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arations of death with indifference, and ſhot defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the foe. His followers, though valiant, ſeemed incapable of the ſame obſtinate reſolution; their features betrayed ſymptoms of diſmay; but turning to their leader, they were ſtruck with his unſhaken boldneſs, they reſumed their native courage, and armed their minds with becoming fortitude. Marano ſighed. The ſenſe of her own misfortune was for a moment ſuſpended.
<q>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,</q>
ſaid ſhe in her ſoul,
<q>this valiant youth, like Oneyo, may be lamented. Some tender maiden, to whom his faith has been plight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may now languiſh for his return. Some aged parent, whoſe infirmities he relieved and ſupported, may be ſighing, anxious for his ſafety. Or ſome orphan ſiſter, helpleſs and forſaken, like me, may, by his death, be made deſolate.</q>
She
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035333_0014_10022EACCFE949B8"/>
then reflected on her own condition, and on the variety of her misfortunes. Carried into captivity in her early years, ſhe was a ſtranger to her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to her kindred. Her huſband no longer exiſted; and he, who had been to her as a father, overcome by age and calamity, was now declining into the grave. Yet alive to compaſſion, ſhe was moved for the unhappy victims. She admired the magnanimity of their leader, and in regarding him, ſhe felt unuſual emotions, and a pang that ſhe could not expreſs. He was of her nation! Could ſhe behold him periſh, and not endeavour to ſave him? Could ſhe behold him tortured, and not ſhed a tear for his ſufferings! Meantime one of the Elders of the nation made a ſignal to the multitude. Immediate ſilence enſued. Then with a look of ſtern ſeverity, he thus expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the captive.
<q>The caldron boils, the ax is ſharpened. Be prepared for torture and painful death. The ſpirit of the deceaſed is yet among us. He lingers on the mountains, or hovers amid the winds. He expects a ſacrifice, and ſhall not chide our delay. Have you a parent or friend? They ſhall never behold you. Prepare for torture and painful death.</q>
               <q>Inflict your tortures,</q>
he replied,
<q>my ſoul contemns them. I have no parents to lament for Sydney. In Albany they were maſſacred, maſſacred by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Indians. I had a ſiſter—I loſt her. She was carried into captivity, and became the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of your ſavage ſury. Inflict your tortures; my ſoul contemns them, but remember, the day of vengeance ſhall overtake you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:035333_0015_10022EAF191BDF28"/>Marano was aſtoniſhed—
<q>Of Albany! reft of his parents by the ſword, and of a ſiſter!</q>
—Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to ſay, he was her brother. Mutual was their amazement, their affection mutual. She fell on his throbbing breaſt. He received her into his arms. His ſoul was ſoftened. Marano for a time was ſpeechleſs. At length weeping and in broken accents—
<q>And have I found thee! a brother to ſolace and ſupport me. Who will guide me through the weary wilderneſs of my ſorrow! Who will be to me as a parent! I was deſolate and forlorn, my ſoul languiſhed and was afflicted; but now I will endure with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</q>
Then turning to the aſtoniſhed multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
<q>He is my brother! Born of the ſame parents! If I have ever merited your favour, O ſave him from deſtruction.</q>
They were deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted. 'Be not diſmayed,' ſaid Ononthio, he ſpake with the conſent of the Elders:
<q>Be not diſmayed. The brother of Marano ſhall be to us as Oneyo.</q>
Then addreſſing himſelf, with an air of dignity to the ſtranger.
<q>Young man, I have loſt a ſon, Marano a huſband, and our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a gallant warrior. He was ſlain by the people of your land, and we are deſirous of grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifying his ſpirit, before it paſſes the mountains, by offering a ſacrifice to his memory. But you are the brother of Marano; by her interceſſion we have changed our deſign, and adopt you into our tribe. Be a brother to our people, and to me a ſon. Supply the place of the dead; and as you poſſeſs his valour, and ſteady boldneſs, may you
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035333_0016_10022EB0A5AE5108"/>
inherit his renown.</q>
So ſaying, he preſented to him the calumet of peace, and a girdle of wampum.</p>
            <p>Meantime the arrival of ſome canoes, filled with armed warriors, attracted the notice of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. They were tranſported with ecſtacy and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, when they deſcried the enſign of their nation, and recognized ſome of their brethren, whom they imagined ſlain. The hopes of Marano were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived. She enquired eagerly for Oneyo.
<q>He periſhed,</q>
anſwered an Indian. She grew pale, her voice faltered, faint and ſpeechleſs, ſhe fell back on the throbbing breaſt of Ononthio.
<q>He periſhed,</q>
continued the Indian,
<q>and with him the prime of our warriors. The armies of France and Britain were marſhalled beneath the walls of Quebec. Direful was the havoc of the battle. The earth trembled with the ſhock of the onſet. The air was tortured with repeated peals. The commanders of both armies were ſlain. The fall was glorious, for their ſouls were undaunted. Reſentment inflamed the combatants. Keen and obſtinate was the encounter. Albion at length prevailed. Her ſons, like a rapid torrent, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the ranks of their adverſaries. We coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled Oneyo to retire. Raging againſt the foe, and performing feats of amazing valour, we ſaw him environed beyond all hope of retreat. We ſaw the impetuoſity of a youthful warrior, who brandiſhed a bloody ſword, ruſhing on to deſtroy him. We haſtened from the field of death. We tarried ſome time in the adjacent foreſts, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the progreſs of the foe. The walls of our
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:035333_0017_10022EB32D8B2630"/>
allies were overthrown. The ſword of Albion will purſue us; and our ſhield, our gallant war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, our Oneyo is no more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This melancholy recital filled the audience with lamentation. But their ſorrow was interrupted by the ſudden aſtoniſhment of the narrator. Caſting his eye accidentally on the Briton,
<q>Seize him, tear him,</q>
he exclaimed;
<q>His was the lifted ſword I beheld! It was he cleft the breaſt of our chieftain! It was he that deſtroyed him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reſentment of the aſſembly was again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed. 'I am innocent of his blood,' ſaid the captive. But his declaration, and the entreaties of Ononthio in his behalf, were loſt in furious ſcreams and invectives. They dragged him again to the place of ſacrifice. Marano, diſtracted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending woes, 'Spare him, ſpare him!' exclaimed, 'He is my brother!' Fixing her eyes on him with a look of exquiſite anguiſh,
<q>whoſe hands are red with the blood of my huſband! And was there none but thee to deſtroy him?</q>
'Tear him,' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the multitude. Marano claſped him to her boſom, and turning to the outrageous and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing, with a wild and frantic demeanour,
<q>Bloody, bloody, though he be, I will defend him, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh! Let the ſame javelin transfix us both! Smite and our kindred gore ſhall be mingled.</q>
The tranſcendent greatneſs of her calamity, who had loſt a huſband by the hand of a brother, and the reſiſtleſs energy of her features, expreſſive of woe, tenderneſs and deſpair, awed the violence of the Aſſembly, and diſpoſed them to pity. Onor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thio
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035333_0018_10022EB577CBD810"/>
took advantage of the change. He waved his hand with parental love and authority. His hoary locks gave dignity to his geſtures. The uſual benignity of his countenance was ſoftened with ſorrow. He ſpoke the language of his ſoul, and was eloquent; ſpoke the language of feeling, and was perſuaſive. They liſtened to him with profound veneration, were moved, and deferred the ſacrifice. He then comforted Marano, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the captives to a place of ſecurity.</p>
            <p>When they were apart from the multitude, 'Tell me,' ſaid he to the Briton,
<q>are you guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the death of my ſon!</q>
'I know not,' he replied; for he had reſumed the pride of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant courage,
<q>I know not whom I have ſlain. I drew my ſword againſt the foes of my country, and I am not anſwerable for the blood I have ſpilt.</q>
'Young man;' ſaid Ononthio, full of ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and parental tenderneſs,
<q>O reflect on a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's feelings. I had an only ſon. He was val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant. He was the prop and ſolace of my old age; if he has gone down to darkneſs and the grave, I have no longer any joy in exiſtence. But, if he lives, and lives by thy clemency, the prayers of an old man ſhall implore bleſſings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and the great ſpirit ſhall reward thee?</q>
While he was yet ſpeaking, a tear roſe in his eye, his voice faltered, he ſighed—
<q>O tell me if my ſon ſurvives.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'I ſlew him not,' he replied.
<q>In the heat of the encounter, a gallant Indian aſſailed me. He was tired and exhauſted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I diſarmed him; and my
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035333_0019_10022EB7C7E4DFC0"/>
ſword was lifted againſt his life.</q>
'Briton,' ſaid he with a reſolute tone,
<q>think not that death diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mays me. I have braved perils and the ſword. I am not a ſuppliant for myſelf. I have an aged parent, whoſe life depends upon mine; the wife of my boſom is a ſtranger among my people, and I alone can protect her.</q>
'Generous youth,' I replied,
<q>go, comfort and protect thy friends. I ſent him forthwith from the field. I never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into his condition; for in preſerving him I obeyed the dictates of my heart.</q>
Marano and Ononthio were overjoyed. But reflecting that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny days had elapſed ſince the diſcomfiture of their allies, and that hitherto they had received no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of Oneyo, their joy ſuffered abatement.</p>
            <p>Meantime Ononthio counſelled his daughter to conduct the ſtrangers to a diſtant retreat, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him there, till, by his influence and authority, he had appeaſed the violence of his brethren.</p>
            <p>It was already night. The Indians were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed to their hamlets, the ſky was calm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded. The full-orbed moon, in ſerene and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn majeſty, aroſe in the eaſt. Her beams were reflected in a blaze of ſilver radiance from the ſmooth and untroubled boſom of the lake. The grey hills and awful foreſts were ſolitary and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. No noiſe was heard, ſave the wailing of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, who lamented the untimely death of their ſons. Marano, with the captives, iſſuing unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the village, purſued their way along the ſilent ſhore, till they arrived at a narrow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented receſs. It was open to the lake, bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035333_0020_10022EB956C96F60"/>
on either ſide by ſhelving precipices, arrayed with living verdure, and parted by a winding riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulet. A venerable oak overſhadowed the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and rendered the ſcene more ſolemn. The other captives were overcome with fatigue, and finding ſome withered leaves in an adjoining cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, they indulged themſelves in repoſe. Marano converſed long with her brother; ſhe poured out her ſoul in her ſympathiſing boſom; ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and relieved. While ſhe leaned on his breaſt, while his arm was folded gently around her, a balmy ſlumber ſurpriſed them. Their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even in ſleep, preſerved the character of their ſouls. A ſmile played innocent on the lips of Marano, her countenance was ineffably tender, and her treſſes lay careleſs on her ſnowy boſom. The features of Sydney, of a bolder and more manly expreſſion, ſeemed full of benignity and complaiſance. Calm and unruffled was their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. They enjoyed the happy viſions of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and dreamed not of impending danger.</p>
            <p>The moon in unrivalled glory, had now attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her meridian, when the intermitting noiſe of rowers came ſlowly along the lake. A canoe was advancing, and the dripping oars ariſing at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals from the water, ſhone gleaming along the deep. The boatman, ſilent and unobſerved, moored their veſſel on the ſandy beach; and a young man of a keen and animated aſpect, arrayed in the ſhaggy ſkin of a bear, armed with a bow and a javelin, having left his companions, was haſtening along the ſhore. It was Oneyo. Having received
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035333_0021_10022EBBE2FEB1C8"/>
wounds in the battle; he had been unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute his return, and had tarried with ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in the neighbourhood of Montreal. By the ſkilful application of herbs and balſams his cure was at length effectuated, and he returned impatient to his nation.</p>
            <p>'I will return ſecretly,' he ſaid.
<q>I will enjoy the ſorrow and regret of Marano, and of my brethren, who, doubtleſs, believe me dead. I will enjoy the ecſtacy of their affection, and their ſurpriſe on my unexpected arrival. My lovely Marano now laments unconſoled. I will haſten to relieve her, and preſs her, weeping with joy, to my faithful tranſported boſom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such were the ſentiments of anticipated rapture that occupied the ſoul of Oneyo, when he diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marano in the arms of a ſtranger. He recoiled. He ſtood motionleſs in an agony of grief, anger, and aſtoniſhment. Pale and trembling he uttered ſome words incoherently. He again advanced, again recogniſed her, then turning abruptly, in bitter anguiſh, ſmiting his breaſt.
<q>Faithleſs and inconſtant,</q>
he cried,
<q>and is this my expected meeting! In the arms of a ſtranger! Arrogant invader of my felicity! He ſhall periſh! His blood ſhall expiate his offence.</q>
Fury flaſhed in his eye, he graſped his javelin, he aimed the blow, and recogniſed his deliverer. Surpriſe and horror ſeized him.
<q>Injured by my deliverer! By him, whom my ſoul revered! And ſhall I dip my hands in his blood! My life he preſerved. Would to Heaven, he had ſlain me! Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035333_0022_10022EBE38FC97B0"/>
and betrayed, Oneyo will not live.—Thou great univerſal Spirit, whoſe path is in the clouds! Whoſe voice is in the thunder! And whoſe eye pierces the heart! O conduct me to the bliſsful valley, for Oneyo will not live.</q>
He ſighed,
<q>One look, one parting look of my love. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her faithful; for her I lived, and for her I die.</q>
He advanced towards her, gazing on her with anguiſh and regret.
<q>She will not weep for me! faithleſs and inconſtant! She will exult! Exult to behold me bleeding! And ſhall it be? Have I cheriſhed her for this? and laviſhed my ſoul on her? to be betrayed! to give her love to a ſtranger!</q>
He pauſed, trembled, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance grew fierce, his eye wild, he graſped his jav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elin.—Marano named him: Her voice was ſoft and plaintive, her viſions were of Oneyo.
<q>O come,</q>
ſhe ſaid,
<q>haſten to thy love! Tarry not, my Oneyo! How I long to behold thee!</q>
               <q>For this, ſaid he, I'll embrace thee.</q>
He embraced her; ſhe awakened, diſcovered her huſband, and flew eagerly into his arms. He flung from her in fierce indignation. 'Away,' he cried,
<q>go, cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh thy ſtranger. Away, perfidious.</q>
She fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him trembling and aghaſt.
<q>He is my brother,</q>
ſhe cried.
'Thy brother'—
<q>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</q>
ſaid he to the Briton, who now approached him,
<q>you preſerved my life. You are generous and valiant. Tell me then, am I to ſalute thee as a friend, and give full vent to my gratitude! or, muſt I view thee as a guileful ſeducer, and lift my javelin againſt thy life?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:035333_0023_10022EBFCC73D5F0"/>The Briton perceiving his error, anſwered him with brevity and compoſure: He related to him the circumſtances of his captivity, and, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, appealed to the teſtimony of his father. Oneyo was ſatisfied. He embraced them. They returned by morning to the village. Ononthio received them with becoming gladneſs, and the day was crowned with rejoicing.</p>

            <p>CHOANG was the fondeſt huſband, and Hanſi the moſt endearing wife, in all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Corea. They were the pattern of conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal bliſs; the inhabitants of the country around ſaw, and envied their felicity. Wherever Choang came, Hanſi was ſure to follow; and in all the pleaſures of Hanſi, Choang was admitted a part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. They walked hand in hand wherever they appeared, ſhewing every mark of mutual ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, embracing, kiſſing; their mouths were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever joined.</p>
            <p>Their love was ſo great, that it was thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could interrupt their mutual peace; when an accident happened, which, in ſome meaſure, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed the huſband's aſſurance of his wife's fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; for love, ſo refined as his, was ſubject to a thouſand little diſquietudes.</p>
            <p>Happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at ſome diſtance from his houſe, he there perceived a lady dreſſed in the deepeſt mourning, fanning the wet clay, that was raiſed over one of the graves, with a large ſan, which ſhe held in her hand. Choang, who had early been
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035333_0027_10022ED840109DE8"/>
taught wiſdom in the ſchool of Lao, was unable to aſſign a cauſe for her preſent employment; and coming up, civilly demanded the reaſon. 'Alas!' replied the lady, her eyes bathed in tears,
<q>how is it poſſible to ſurvive the loſs of my huſband, who lies buried in this grave? He was the beſt of men, the tendereſt of huſbands; with his dying breath he bid me never marry again, till the earth over his grave ſhould be dry; and here you ſee me ſteadily reſolving to obey his will, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to dry it with my fan. I have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed two whole days in fulfilling his commands, and am determined not to marry, till they are punctually obeyed, even though his grave ſhould take up four days in drying.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Choang, who was ſtruck with the widow's beauty, could not, however, avoid ſmiling at her haſte to be married; but, concealing the cauſe of his mirth, civilly invited her home; adding, that he had a wife, who might be capable of giving her ſome conſolation. As ſoon as he and his gueſt were returned, he imparted to Hanſi in private what he had ſeen, and could not avoid expreſſing his uneaſineſs, that ſuch might be his own caſe, if his deareſt wife ſhould one day happen to ſurvive him.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to deſcribe Hanſi's reſentment at ſo unkind a ſuſpicion. As her paſſion for him was not only great, but extremely delicate, ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed tears, anger, frowns, and exclamations, to chide his ſuſpicions; the widow herſelf was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt; and Hanſi declared, ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved

never to ſleep under the ſame roof with a wretch, who, like her, could be guilty of ſuch barefaced inconſtancy. The night was cold and ſtormy; however, the ſtranger was obliged to ſeek another lodging, for Choang was not diſpoſed to reſiſt, and Hanſi would have her way.</p>
            <p>The widow had ſcarce been gone an hour, when an old diſciple of Choang's, whom he had not ſeen for many years, came to pay him a viſit. He was received with the utmoſt ceremony, placed in the moſt honourble ſeat at ſupper, and the wine began to circulate with great freedom. Choang and Hanſi exhibited open marks of mutual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and unfeigned reconciliation; nothing could equal their apparent happineſs; ſo fond a huſband, ſo obedient a wife, few could behold without regretting their own infelicity; when lo! their happineſs was at once diſturbed by a moſt fatal accident. Choang fell lifeleſs in an apoplec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic fit upon the floor. Every method was uſed, but in vain, for his recovery. Hanſi was at firſt inconſolable for her huſband's death: After ſome hours, however, ſhe found ſpirits to read his laſt will. The enſuing day ſhe began to moralize and talk wiſdom; the next day ſhe was able to comfort the young diſciple; and, on the third, to ſhorten a long ſtory, they both agreed to be married.</p>
            <p>There was now no longer mourning in the apartments, the body of Choang was thruſt into an old coffin, and placed in one of the meaneſt rooms, there to lie unattended until the time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by law for his interment. In the mean
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:035333_0029_10022EDC1B45A4C8"/>
time, Hanſi and the young diſciple were arrayed in the moſt magnificent habits; the bride wore in her noſe a jewel, of immenſe price, and her lover was dreſſed in all the finery of his former maſter, together with a pair of artificial whiſkers that reached to his middle. The hour of his nuptials was arrived; the whole family ſympathiſed with their approaching happineſs; the apartments were brightened up with a light that diffuſed the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite perfumes, and a luſtre more bright than noonday. The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apartment, with impatience; when his ſervant, approaching with terror in his countenance, informed her that his maſter was fallen into a fit, which would certainly be mortal, unleſs the heart of a man lately dead, could be obtained, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to his breaſt. She ſcarce waited to the end of his ſtory, when, tucking up her clothes, ſhe ran with a mattock in her hand to the coffin, where Choang lay, reſolving to apply the heart of her dead huſband, as a cure for the living. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtruck the lid with the utmoſt violence; in a few blows the coffin flew open, when the body, which to all appearance had been dead, began to move. Terrified at the ſight, Hanſi dropped the mattock, and Choang walked out, aſtoniſhed at his own ſituation, his wife's unuſual magnificence, and her more amazing ſurpriſe. He went among the apartments, unable to conceive the cauſe of ſo much ſplendor. He was not long in ſuſpenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his domeſtics informed him of every tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince he firſt became inſenſible. He could
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035333_0030_10022EDE66CE0948"/>
ſcarce believe what they told him, and went in purſuit of Hanſi herſelf, in order to receive more certain information, or to reproach her infidelity. But ſhe prevented his reproaches: he ſound her weltering in blood; for ſhe had ſtabbed herſelf to the heart, being unable to ſurvive her ſhame and diſappointment.</p>
            <p>Choang, being a philoſopher, was too wiſe to make any loud lamentations; he thought it beſt to bear his loſs with ſerenity; ſo mending up the old coffin, where he had lain himſelf, he placed his faithleſs ſpouſe in his room; and, unwilling that ſo many nuptial preparations ſhould be expended in vain, he the ſame night married the widow with the large fan.</p>
            <p>As they both were appriſed of the foibles of each other beforehand, they knew how to excuſe them after marriage. They lived together for many years in great tranquillity, and not expecting to find rapture, made a ſhift to find contentment.</p>

            <p>NO obſervation is more common, and at the ſame time more true, than that one half of the world are ignorant how the other half live. The misfortunes of the great are held up to engage our attention; are enlarged upon in tones of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035333_0033_10022EE493F36FE8"/>
and the world is called upon to gaze at the noble ſufferers: the great, under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of calamity, are conſcious of others ſympathiſing with their diſtreſs; and have, at once, the comfort of admiration and pity.</p>
            <p>There is nothing magnanimous in bearing miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes with fortitude, when the whole world is looking on: men in ſuch circumſtances will act bravely, even from motives of vanity; but he who, in the vale of obſcurity, can brave adverſity; who, without friends to encourage, acquaintance to pity, or even without hope to alleviate his misfortunes, can behave with tranquillity and indifference, is truly great: whether peaſant or courtier, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves admiration, and ſhould be held up for our imitation and reſpect.</p>
            <p>I have been led into theſe reflections, from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally meeting, ſome days ago, a poor fellow, whom I knew when a boy, dreſſed in a ſailor's jacket, and begging at one of the outlets of the town, with a wooden leg. I knew him to have been honeſt and induſtrious, when in the country, and curious to learn what had reduced him to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation; wherefore, after giving him what I thought proper, I deſired to know the hiſtory of his life and misfortunes. The diſabled ſoldier, for ſuch he was, though dreſſed in a ſailor's habit, ſcratching his head, and leaning on his crutch, put himſelf into an attitude to comply with my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and gave me his hiſtory, as follows:</p>
            <p>'As for my misfortunes, maſter, I can't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have gone through any more than other
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035333_0034_10022EF15C6610B8"/>
folks; for except the loſs of my limb, and my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to beg, I don't know any reaſon, thank heaven, that I have to complain; there is <hi>BILL TIBBS,</hi> of our regiment, he has loſt both his legs, and an eye to boot; but, thank heaven, it is not ſo bad with me yet. I was born in <hi>Shropſhire;</hi> my father was a labourer, and died when I was five years old; ſo I was put upon the pariſh. As he had been a wandering ſort of a man, the pariſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioners were not able to tell to what pariſh I belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or where I was born; ſo they ſent me to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pariſh, and that pariſh ſent me to a third. I thought in my heart, they kept ſending me about ſo long, that they would not let me be in born any pariſh at all; but, at laſt, however, they fixed me. I had ſome diſpoſition to be a ſcholar, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at leaſt to know my letters; but the maſter of the workhouſe put me to buſineſs as ſoon as I was able to handle a mallet; and here I lived an eaſy kind of life for five years. I only wrought ten hours in the day, and had my meat and drink provided for my labour. It is true, I was not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſtir out of the houſe, for fear, as they ſaid, I ſhould run away. But what of that? I had the liberty of the whole houſe, and the yard before the door; and that was enough for me. I was then bound out to a farmer, where I was up early and late; but I ate and drank well, and liked my buſineſs well enough, till he died, when I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to provide for myſelf; ſo I was reſolved to go and ſeek my fortune.</p>
            <p>'In this manner I went from town to town,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035333_0035_10022EF49CBF3508"/>
worked where I could get employment, and ſtarved when I could get none; when happening one day to go through a field belonging to a juſtice of peace, I ſpied a hare croſſing the path juſt before me; and I believe the devil put it in my head to fling my ſtick at it. Well, what will you have on't? I killed the hare, and was bringing it away, when the juſtice himſelf met me: he called me a poacher, and, collaring me, deſired I would give an account of myſelf. I fell upon my knees, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his worſhip's pardon, and began to give a full account of all that I knew of my breed, ſeed, and generation; but, though I gave a very true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the juſtice ſaid I could give no account, ſo I was indicted at the Seſſions, found guilty of being poor, and ſent up to London, to Newgate, in order to be tranſported as a vagabond.</p>
            <p>'People may ſay this and that of being in jail; but, for my part, I found Newgate as agreeable a place as ever I was in, in all my life. I had my bellyfull to eat and drink, and did no work at all. This kind of life was too good to laſt forever; ſo I was taken out of priſon, after five months, put on board a ſhip, and ſent off with two hundred more, to the plantations. We had but an indifferent paſſage; for being all confined in the hold, more than a hundred of our people died for want of ſweet air; and thoſe that remained were ſickly enough, God knows. When we came aſhore, we were ſold to the planters, and I was bound for ſeven years more. As I was no ſcholar, for I did not know my letters, I was obliged to work among the negroes;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035333_0036_10022EF62A1B4430"/>
and I ſerved out my time as in duty bound to do.</p>
            <p>'When my time was expired, I worked my paſſage home; and glad I was to ſee Old England again, becauſe I loved my country. I was afraid, however, that I ſhould be indicted for a vagabond once more, ſo did not much care to go down into the country, but kept about the town, and did little jobs, when I could get them.</p>
            <p>'I was very happy in this manner for ſome time, till one evening, coming home from work, two men knocked me down, and then deſired me to ſtand. They belonged to a preſs gang. I was carried before the juſtice, and, as I could give no account of myſelf, I had my choice left, whether to go on board a man of war, or liſt for a ſoldier. I choſe the latter, and, in this poſt of a gentleman, I ſerved two campaigns in Flanders, was at the battle of Val and Vontenoy, and received but one wound, through the breaſt here; but the doctor of our regiment ſoon made me well again.</p>
            <p>'When the peace came on, I was diſcharged: and, as I could not work, becauſe my wound was ſometimes troubleſome, I liſted for a landſman in the Eaſt India company's ſervice. I have fought the French in ſix pitched battles; and I verily believe, that if I could read or write, our captain would have made me a corporal. But it was not my good fortune to have any promotion, for I ſoon fell ſick, and ſo got leave to return home again, with forty pounds in my pocket. This was at the beginning of the preſent war, and I hoped to be ſet on ſhore, and to have the pleaſure of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035333_0037_10022EF8B54106B0"/>
my money; but the government wanted men, and ſo I was preſſed for a ſailor, before ever I could ſet foot on ſhore.</p>
            <p>'The boatſwain ſound me, as he ſaid, an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate fellow; he ſwore he knew that I underſtood my buſineſs well, but that I ſhammed Abraham, to be idle; but God knows, I knew nothing of ſea-buſineſs, and he beat me without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he was about. I had ſtill, however, my forty pounds, and that was ſome comfort to me, under every beating; and the money I might have had to this day, but that our ſhip was taken by the French, and ſo I loſt it all.</p>
            <p>'Our crew was carried into Breſt, and many of them died, becauſe they were not uſed to live in jail; but for my part, it was nothing to me, for I was ſeaſoned. One night, as I was aſleep on my bed of boards, with a warm blanket about me, (for I always loved to lie well) I was awakened by the boatſwain, who had a dark lanthorn in his hand. 'Jack,' ſays he to me,
<q>will you knock out the French centry's brains?</q>
'I don't care,' ſays I, ſtriving to keep myſelf awake,
<q>if I lend a hand.</q>
'Then follow me,' ſays he, 'and I hope we ſhall do the buſineſs.' So up I got, and tied my blanket, which was all the clothes I had, about my middle, and went with him to fight the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. I hate the French, becauſe they are all ſlaves, and wear wooden ſhoes.</p>
            <p>'Though we had no arms, one Engliſhman is able to beat five French at any time; ſo we went down to the door, where both the centries
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035333_0038_10022EFB06781120"/>
were poſted, and, ruſhing upon them, ſeized their arms in a moment, and knocked them down. From thence, nine of us ran together to the quay, and ſeizing the firſt boat we met, got out of the harbour, and put to ſea. We had not been here three days, before we were taken up by the Dorſet privateer, who were glad of ſo many good hands; and we conſented to run our chance. However, we had not as much luck as we expected. In three days we fell in with the Pompadour privateer, of forty guns, while we had but twenty three; ſo to it we went, yard-arm and yard-arm. The fight laſted for three hours, and I verily believe, we ſhould have taken the Frenchman, had we but had ſome more men left behind; but, unfortunately, we loſt all our men, juſt as we were going to get the victory.</p>
            <p>'I was once more in the power of the French, and, I believe, it would have gone hard with me, had I been brought back to Breſt; but by good fortune we were retaken by the Viper. I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgot to tell you, that in that engagement, I was wounded in two places; I loſt four fingers off the left hand, and my leg was ſhot off. If I had had the good fortune to have loſt my leg and the uſe of my hand, on board a king's ſhip, and not on board a privateer, I ſhould have been intitled to clothing and maintenance during the reſt of my life; but that was not my chance: one man is born with a ſilver ſpoon in his mouth, and another with a wooden ladle. However, bleſſed be God! I enjoy good health, and will forever love liberty
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035333_0039_10022EFC9327D6D0"/>
and Old England. Liberty, property, and Old England, forever, huzza!'</p>
            <p>Thus ſaying, he limped off, leaving me in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at his intrepidity and content; nor could I avoid acknowledging, that an habitual acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with miſery ſerves better than philoſophy to teach us to deſpiſe it.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>ADELA was the only daughter of a powerful baron of Aquitaine. Her father, ſprung from an illuſtrious family, added to hereditary honours, the glory of heroic achievements. In his youth, he accompanied the flower of the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an chivalry, who fought under the banner of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, and recovered the holy ſepulchre from the hands of the infidel. He returned to his country, crowned with victory and fair renown; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited the rich domains of his anceſtors.</p>
            <p>Adela was in the prime of beauty, and poſſeſſed a ſuſceptible heart. In her air and aſpect, digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was mingled with ſweetneſs: For in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of her mind, conſcious elevation of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſoftened by amiable and mild affections.</p>
            <p>Edwin, a gallant youth, animated with the generous love of arms, ſmit with the renown of Albert's proweſs, and ambitious of profiting by the narrative of his exploits, repaired with other warriors to his hoſpitable caſtle. His eye, keen and piercing, indicated a fiery, vigorous and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035333_0044_10022F0753C5D038"/>
ſpirit: His form was well fitted to kindle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in the boſom of tender maids: And the heart of Adela was not inſenſible to his merit. Their paſſion was mutual. He gazed on her unaffected charms with aſtoniſhment; for till then, he had never felt the tender anxiety, the reſtleſs longing, and languiſhment of love. Ambition had been the governing paſſion of his ſoul; but the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ambition now yielded to a ſofter, though no leſs ardent deſire. He no longer diſcourſed, in keen rapture, of marſhalled hoſts, of liſted fields, and feats of venturous daring; but languiſhed on the ineffable attractions of a roſeate complexion, and a tender melting eye. The vehement impatience of the warrior was loſt in the complacency and penſiveneſs of the lover.</p>
            <p>Albert, perceiving this change in his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, demanded the cauſe. Edwin replied in candid and reſpectful guiſe: He told him, without reſerve, of the impreſſion made on his ſoul, by the peerleſs beauty of Adela. And, with the temerity of youthful paſſion, beſought him to ratify his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere attachment by wedlock.
<q>And who art thou,</q>
ſaid the houghty baron,
<q>who pretendeſt to the love of Adela? What feats of heroic proweſs haſt thou achieved? Or is thy anceſtry diſtinguiſhed among the chieftains of the ſouth? Thy ſhield is inſcribed with no valorous achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor are thy deeds, nor the deeds of thy fathers, rehearſed by recording minſtrels. Gain thee a name in arms, and then aſpire to the envied alliance of the Houſe of Albert.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:035333_0045_10022F09C438BFE0"/>Theſe words, like an arrow, penetrated the heart of Edwin. Love and ambition, hitherto at variance, were now united; they concurred in the ſame purſuit; and their vehemence was irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Accordingly, the youthful warrior prepared for his departure, and took a tender farewell of Adela. 'Farewell,' ſhe replied, the tears guſhing from her radiant eyes,
<q>Heaven knows no gallant youth, but thee, ever ſhared my affections. May the holy angels, who regard true and virtuous love with eſteem, grant thee protection. Speedy be thy return! and O! remember me. Gay and courtly dames, ſkilled in ſeducements and cunning device, may ſtrive to allure thee; but their love will not equal mine.</q>
They plighted vows of mutual fidelity, and exchanged tokens of unſhaken attachment. Then Edwin, clad in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete armour, a gay undaunted warrior, mounted a ſteed proudly capariſoned, and bent his courſe to the plains of Catalonia, where the Saracen waded in the blood of Spain.</p>
            <p>Soon after his departure, Edgar, a proud and wealthy chieftain, with a numerous retinue of knights and retainers, came to the caſtle of Albert. He was received with pomp and hoſpitable wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. He caſt amorous glances on the reſerved, unrivalled charms of Adela. He preferred his courtſhip with ſtudied ſmiles and ſpeeches deviſed with cunning. She heard him at firſt with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; he perſiſted; and ſhe requited him with contempt. He then addreſſed his ſuit to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He boaſted of the high renown of his anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035333_0046_10022F0B95AA43C0"/>
and the wide extent of his domain: He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiated on the number of his vaſſals; and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in magnificent terms, on the mutual honour and ſecurity that would accrue from ſo ſeemly an alliance. Albert liſtened to him with partial and pleaſed attention: He repented of the hopes he had encouraged in the ſoul of Edwin; and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to perſuade his daughter to forget her attachment to that valiant youth. In vain the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhed Adela lamented, wept, intreated; in vain ſhe threw herſelf at her father's feet, and tore her diſhevelled treſſes, and in anguiſh ſmote her breaſt. Her oppoſition, inſtead of mitigating his rigour, irritated his reſentment, and confirmed him in his ungenerous purpoſe. He mingled menaces and unkindly reproach with his perſuaſions:
<q>By the holy rood,</q>
ſaid he, with a faſtidious and wrathful aſpect,
<q>the honor of my houſe ſhall not be ſtained by the pretenſions of a low-born boy. Degenerated as thou art, the meanneſs of thy ſentiments ſhall not fully the ſplendour of thine anceſtry, nor load my reſpected age with diſhonour. Receive the addreſſes of Edgar with ſuitable regard, and the deference due to my commands. Meantime preparations ſhall be made for the bridal ſolemnity in a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the dignity of this alliance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Adela, after remonſtrating in vain againſt the ſeverity of his commands, intreated, with an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dejected air, that the marriage-ceremony might be delayed. 'Can Edgar,' ſaid ſhe,
<q>prize the cold and conſtrained embraces of a heart
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035333_0047_10022F0E9F24D6E0"/>
that throbs for another? Will the ſighing and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of a broken ſpirit accord with the fond ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes of a bridegroom? To Edwin my faith was plighted, and on him my imagination hath dwelt. Give me time, therefore, to divert the current of an affection too violent to be ſuddenly oppoſed; to diſcourage the reveries of fancy, animated by a legal and habituated paſſion; and to be reconciled to the addreſſes of Edgar.</q>
As her reaſoning was plauſible, the nuptial ſolemnity was deferred. But, as ſoon as ſhe retired from her father's preſence, ſhe ſummoned a page in whom ſhe confided, and ſpoke to him in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner:
<q>Prepare thee for a long journey: Saddle the fleeteſt of my father's ſteeds; and during the obſcurity of the night, depart. Hie thee to the banks of the Ebro; find Edwin; tell him of the perils that beſet me; tell him that a wealthy and powerful rival, with coſtly parade, and glittering ſhew of blazonry, hath impoſed on my father, and inſinuated himſelf into his eſteem.</q>
The menial bowed with humble obeiſance, and, with profeſſions of diligence and fidelity, departed.</p>
            <p>Meantime Edgar preſſed his ſuit with courteous phraſe and dalliance. Daily tournaments were exhibited at the caſtle of Albert. The knights and barons of the neighbouring domains attended: But Edgar ſurpaſſed them in the ſplendour of his armour, and the pomp of his retinue. The hall reſounded with revelry and rejoicing; and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels clad in gaudy apparel celebrated the praiſes of warlike chiefs, or ſung the power and the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:035333_0048_10022F102CCA52E8"/>
of love. Adela arrayed her countenance with ſmiles and courteſy; but her boſom was diſtracted with anguiſh, and her couch was bedewed with weeping. 'O when,' ſhe cried,
<q>ſhall I be deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered from the importunity of a deteſted ſuitor; and the bondage of a feigned complacency? When will Edwin return, adorned with conqueſt, and confident with ſucceſs? His merit ſhall ſhine unrivalled, and Edgar be covered with ſhame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>At length the page returned; and repairing to the apartment of his mournful dame,
<q>Now heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en foreſend,</q>
ſaid he,
<q>moſt gracious lady, that the tidings I bring ſhould injure thy tender frame more than thou art able to endure. May the ſaints and miniſtering angels uphold thee!</q>
— 'Hath he periſhed?' cried Adela, with a look of terror and amazement.
<q>In what bloody field hath he fallen? Where lies the lifeleſs body? What barbarous adverſary hath mangled and inſulted his graceful form?</q>
—
<q>He hath not periſhed,</q>
replied the menial.
<q>But O gentle lady! foul arts have been practiſed; ſhameful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy hath been committed. Edwin lives, but not for thee; he hath given his hand to another!</q>
—
'Peace, peace!' interrupted Adela, with a faulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing utterance, and looks of aſtoniſhment, mixed with anger;
<q>reſtrain thy blaſphemous ſpeech: nor with baſe calumny aſperſe the fame of a true and gallant warrior.</q>
—'When,' anſwered the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,
<q>have I been guilty of deceit or infidelity towards my gentle miſtreſs? Full ſore it grieveth me to be the meſſenger of evil tidings.</q>
—
<q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035333_0049_10022F11BA0C88E0"/>
them unreſervedly,</q>
cried Adela, with a tone of anxious impatience.</p>
            <p>'I purſued my journey,' ſaid he,
<q>many days without any adventure, till I came within ſight of a ſtately caſtle. It ſtood on the brow of a woody hill; was garniſhed with towers and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements; and commanded a wide proſpect of cultivaled fields and foreſts. As I advanced, mine ear was ſuddenly ſurpriſed with the din of hounds and horns, mingled with the cries of the huntſmen. I ſoon deſcried a gallant ſhew of knights and gorgeous dames, mounted on milk-white courſers, and purſuing the rapid deer. When the chace was ended, they ſtopped by the ſide of a chryſtal brook; and a comely youth, arrayed in ſhining apparel, alighted from his foamy ſteed, with courtly obeiſance, preſented the prey to a fair and ſmiling lady. I mingled in their company, and in the lineaments of the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous youth recogniſed the inconſtant Edwin. O gentle lady, may Heaven ſo help me in my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt need, as I now ſpeak the words of truth; and may the faints and holy angels ſo ſuccour thee as thy miſhap requires. The faithleſs youth hath committed treaſon againſt thy love: Seduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blandiſhment of an artful dame, he hath become forgetful of thy peerleſs beauty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The heart of Adela throbbed with anguiſh dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the recital. 'Valorous, heroic warrior!' ſhe exclaimed,
<q>are theſe thy deeds of hardy proweſs, to betray the innocent credulity of an eaſy maid! Stain to manhood, and the honored profeſſion of
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035333_0050_10022F176C53BF70"/>
arms, be henceforth baniſhed from my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Meantime Edgar advanced his ſuit with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled ardour. Albert, unable to brook any longer delay, inſiſted on having the bridal ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſolemnized; and Adela, incited by ſecret pride and reſentment, ſubmitted to the will of her father. The report of this noble alliance was publiſhed through the land; and the kindred of Albert and Edgar, with the neighbouring barons, were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to grace the ſolemnity. Already were the parties betrothed; the holy benediction was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready pronounced; and forever was Adela to be the wedded ſpouſe of Edgar. Now, with pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous ſhew and attendance the banquet was ſerved up to dames and knights, the flower of courteſy and valour. The caſtle reſounded with minſtrelſy and the dance, when a ſtranger, in the ſimple garb of a pilgrim, entered the hall. He caſt his eyes around on the goodly company, and, with an air of ſanctity and reſpect, implored a bleſſing on their friendſhip. He was received with hoſpitable welcome, and the reverence due to his holy ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. He ſpake in meek and modeſt guiſe; his eyes were often fixed on Adela: they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dimmed with a gliſtening tear, and ever and anon his boſom heaved with involuntary ſighs. He took up the harp of a minſtrel; he touched the ſtrings with maſterly cunning, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the notes with a melodious voice. Tuneful, but melancholy was the ſtrain; for he ſung the ſorrows of thoſe that are forſaken; the anguiſh of
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035333_0051_10022F18F8D84EA0"/>
a deſponding ſpirit; and the wounds inflicted on a faithful heart by inconſtancy and proud diſdain. He deſiſted with marks of grief and inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. 'Holy pilgrim,' ſaid Albert,
<q>the ſenſe of calamity devours thy ſpirit. Inform us of thy miſhhap, that, if poſſible, we may adminiſter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Nor think it incompatible with bridal feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity to indulge compaſſion, and aſſuage the torment of heart-felt care.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'I am the ſon of a freeman,' replied the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
<q>and though my birth was not ennobled by ſplendid titles, nor my anceſtry diſtinguiſhed by the parade of blazonry, my boſom burned with the love of arms, and my heart was upright. In an unlucky hour I became enamoured of a gentle dame, the only daughter of a noble baron. My ſincere, though preſumptuous ſuit, ſeemed not diſpleaſing to that peerleſs beauty; and with the raſh, intemperate boldneſs of a lover, I aſked her in marriage of her ſire. Go, ſaid he, gain thee a name in arms, and then aſpire to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied alliance of my houſe. I departed, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tender interchange of vows and tokens of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection with the beloved idol of my heart. I haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to the plains of Catalonia, where the Sara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen was waging fierce battle againſt the banner of the holy croſs. I proffered my ſervice to the chief of the Chriſtians; and that my ſword was not idle, and that I was not backward in the ſtrife of arms, my honourable wounds can teſtify. Neither were my ſervices, nor my thirſt after mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fame unrewarded. Fair recompence have I
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035333_0052_10022F1CECCFCD40"/>
received, and the fun of glory hath gilded the obſcurity of my birth. Rejoicing in my ſucceſs, I haſtened my return. But what power of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance can expreſs the agony of my ſoul, when I learned that the faithleſs and inconſtant dame had yielded to the vows of another? I who was ſo true and loyal to my love and plighted troth, to be ſo ſoon forgot, ſo ſoon forſaken.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Enough! enough!' cried Adela,
<q>O ill-requit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lover! pierce not my ſoul with deeper wounds. O Edwin! Edwin! never was I inconſtant. Bear witneſs, ye holy angels! But traitorous guile has been practiſed: Thy integrity hath been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, and my vexed heart betrayed into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The eyes of all were now turned on the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: He threw off his diſguiſe, and, inſtead of a pilgrim's ſtaff, he graſped a keen and trenchant weapon. Reſentment glowed on his cheek, and flaſhed from his fiery eye. 'And who,' ſaid he,
<q>hath impeached mine integrity? Stand forth, thou proud, but daſtard baron, whoſe glozing tales have betrayed the unwary heart of a tender maiden: It is Edwin demands reparation.</q>
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious fear was manifeſt in the diſordered features, the pale cheek, and diſconcerted air of Edgar. He nevertheleſs accepted the challenge; and the two warriors, arraying themſelves in complete ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, deſcended into the court of the caſtle. In the firſt onſet, the well tempered ſteel of Edwin cleft the creſted helm of his adverſary; he threw him to the ground, and diſarmed him.
<q>Confeſs
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035333_0053_10022F1FF49067D8"/>
thy guilt,</q>
ſaid the conqueror,
<q>and by what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous arts thou haſt accompliſhed thy deſign.</q>
— 'By gifts and glittering gold,' he replied,
<q>I cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the page of Adela, who, with counterfeited ſemblance of fidelity and regret, accuſed thee of inconſtancy, and impoſed falſhood on the eaſy ear of his miſtreſs. I embraced the ſeaſon of her excited reſentment, and forwarded my ſuit with ſucceſs. She is mine by the indiſſoluble ties of wedlock: And know, proud boy, that if thy hands be ſtained with my blood, it is the blood of Adela's huſband; and if ſhe receives thee to her boſom, ſhe receives the ſlayer of her ſpouſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Edwin ſtarted with apparent horror. He pauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but recollecting himſelf, 'Ariſe,' he cried,
<q>and by another trial, prove thyſelf worthy of that envied title.</q>
So ſaying, he raiſed him from the ground; and both warriors addreſſed themſelves a ſecond time to the fight. Edgar, burning with exaſperated rancour, aimed his ſpear at his rival's breaſt. Edwin neither averted nor avoided the deadly blow. The keen weapon cleft his breaſt, and was tinged in the purple ſprings of his heart. He fell to the ground. 'Farewell,' he cried,
<q>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dela! lady peerleſs! and dearly beloved. I have proved myſelf worthy of thy eſteem: I die a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to thy repoſe. With my hands red with thy huſband's blood, could I ever aſpire to thy love? Could I ſurvive and behold thee the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded bride of another!</q>
He heaved a ſigh and died. 'Inhuman deed!' cried Adela, tearing her lovely treſſes, and beating her ſnow-white breaſt. She

ran, ſhe threw herſelf on the bloody body, 'O ſtay!' ſhe exclaimed,
<q>O leave me not in my woe. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, fleeting ſpirit! Reanimate theſe pallid features. He heeds me not.—I heard a voice! a dreary voice! It was Edwin! He ſummons me away!—I come! I come! Let the nuptial bed be prepared! the clay-cold bed!</q>

            <p>Inſtantly the menial, who had been corrupted by Edgar, ſeizing a dagger, ruſhed behind that treacherous baron, and pierced him to the heart. 'Periſh!' he cried,
<q>author of my ruin, and of the ruin of the Houſe of Albert.</q>
He grew imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately frantic: He ran forth furious and ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The memory of his crimes purſued him; and his reaſon was never reſtored.</p>
            <p>The obſequies of the deceaſed were celebrated with due ſolemnity; Holy requiems were chanted over their remains; and pious prieſts preferred oriſons for their eternal repoſe. Albert, unable to ſuſtain the weight of his misfortune, forſook the habitation of his anceſtors; and expoſing his old age to fatigue, undertook a pilgrimage to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Land, where he ended his days in a monaſtery.</p>

            <p>EDWARD the Third, after the battle of Creſſy, laid ſiege to Calais. He had fortified his camp in ſo impregnable a manner, that all the efforts of France proved ineffectual to raiſe the ſiege, or throw ſuccours into the city. The citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, however, under the conduct of Count Vienne, their gallant governour, made an admirable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Day after day the Engliſh effected many a breach, which they repeatedly expected to ſtorm by morning; but, when morning appeared, they wondered to behold new ramparts raiſed, nightly erected out of the ruins which the day had made.</p>
            <p>France had now put the ſickle into her ſecond harveſt ſince Edward with his victorious army ſat down before the town. The eyes of all Europe were intent on the iſſue. The Engliſh made their approaches and attacks without remiſſion; but the citizens were as obſtinate in repelling all their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:035333_0058_10022F2A42B498B0"/>At length, famine did more for Edward than arms. After the citizens had devoured the lean carcaſes of their ſtarved cattle, they tore up old foundations and rubbiſh in ſearch of vermin. They fed on boiled leather and the weeds of exhauſted gardens, and a morſel of damaged corn was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a matter of luxury.</p>
            <p>In this extremity they reſolved to attempt the enemy's camp. They boldly ſallied forth; the Engliſh joined battle; and, after a long and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate engagement, Count Vienne was taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and the citizens, who ſurvived the ſlaughter, retired within their gates.</p>
            <p>On the captivity of the governour, the command devolved upon Euſtace Saint Pierre, the mayor of the town, a man of mean birth, but of exalted virtue.</p>
            <p>Euſtace now found himſelf under the neceſſity of capitulating, and offered to deliver to Edward the city, with all the poſſeſſions and wealth of the inhabitants, provided he permitted them to depart with life and liberty.</p>
            <p>As Edward had long ſince expected to aſcend the throne of France, he was exaſperated, to the laſt degree, againſt theſe people, whoſe ſole valour had defeated his warmeſt hopes; he therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take an exemplary revenge, though he wiſhed to avoid the imputation of cruelty. He anſwered, by Sir Walter Manny, that they all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved capital puniſhment, as obſtinate traitors to him, their true and natural ſovereign. That, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in his wonted clemency, he conſented to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035333_0059_10022F2C909BA9C8"/>
the bulk of the plebeians, provided they would deliver up to him ſix of their principal citizens, with halters about their necks, as victims of due atonement for that ſpirit of rebellion with which they had enflamed the vulgar herd.</p>
            <p>All the remains of this deſolate city were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in the great ſquare, and, like men arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a tribunal from whence there was no appeal, expected with beating hearts the ſentence of their conqueror.</p>
            <p>When Sir Walter had declared his meſſage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation and pale diſmay was impreſſed on every face. Each looked upon death as his own inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lot; for how ſhould they deſire to be ſaved at the price propoſed? whom had they to deliver ſave parents, brothers, kindred, or valiant neighbours, who had ſo often expoſed their lives in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence? To a long and dead ſilence, deep ſighs and groans ſucceeded; till Euſtace St. Pierre, getting up to a little eminence, thus addreſſed the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My friends, we are brought to great ſtraits this day. We muſt either ſubmit to the terms of our cruel and enſnaring conqueror; or yield up our tender infants, our wives, and chaſte daughters, to the bloody and brutal luſts of the violating ſoldiery.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Look about you, my friends, and fix your eyes on the perſons, whom you wiſh to deliver up as the victims of your own ſafety. Which of theſe would ye appoint to the rack, the axe, or the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Is there any here who has not fought for
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035333_0060_10022F2E459EF700"/>
you, who has not bled for you? who through the length of this inveterate ſiege, has not ſuffered fatigues and miſeries, a thouſand times worſe than death, that you and your's might ſurvive to days of peace and proſperity? Is it your preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, then, whom you would deſtine to deſtruction? you will not, you cannot do it. Juſtice, honour, humanity, make ſuch a treaſon impoſſible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Where then is our reſource? Is there any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient left, whereby we may avoid guilt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy on the one hand, or the deſolation and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of a ſacked city on the other? There is, my friends, there is one expedient left; a gracious, an excellent, a god-like expedient! Is there any here to whom virtue is dearer than life; let him offer himſelf an oblation for the ſafety of his people! He ſhall not fail of a bleſſed approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that Power, who offered up his only Son for the ſalvation of mankind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He ſpoke — but an univerſal ſilence enſued. Each man looked around for the example of that virtue and magnanimity, in others, which all wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to approve in themſelves, though they wanted the reſolution.</p>
            <p>At length St. Pierre reſumed—
<q>It had been baſe in me, my fellow citizens, to propoſe any matter of damage to others, which I myſelf had not been willing to undergo in my own perſon. But I held it ungenerous to deprive any man of that preference and eſtimation, which might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a firſt offer, on ſo ſignal an occaſion. For I doubt not but there are many here as ready,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035333_0061_10022F3099E35D78"/>
nay, more zealous of this martyrdom than I can be, however modeſty and the fear of imputed oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation may withhold them from being foremoſt in exhibiting their merits.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Indeed, the ſtation, to which the captivity of Lord Vienne has unhappily raiſed me, imparts a right to be the firſt in giving my life for your ſakes, I give it freely, I give it cheerfully; who comes next?</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Your ſon.' exclaimed a youth, not yet come to maturity.—'Ah, my child!' cried St. Pierre,
<q>I am, then, twice ſacrificed.—But no—I have rather begotten thee a ſecond time.—Thy years are few but full, my ſon! the victim of virtue has reached the utmoſt purpoſe and goal of mortality. Who next, my friends?—This is the hour of heroes.</q>
—'Your kinſman,' cried John de Aire. 'Your kinſman,' cried James Wiſſant.
<q>Your kinſman,</q>
cried Peter Wiſſant. —'Ah!' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Sir Walter Mauny, burſting into tears, 'why was I not a citizen of Calais?'</p>
            <p>The ſixth victim was ſtill wanting, but was quickly ſupplied by lot, from numbers, who were now emulous of ſo ennobling an example.</p>
            <p>The keys of the city were then delivered to Sir Walter. He took the ſix priſoners into his cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He ordered the gates to be opened, and gave charge to his attendants to conduct the remaining citizens, with their families, through the camp of the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>Before they departed, however, they deſired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to take their laſt adieu of their deliverers.
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035333_0062_10022F32E51E3A50"/>
—What a parting, what a ſcene! they crouded with their wives and children about St. Pierre and his fellow priſoners. They embraced, they clung around, they wept aloud; and the joint clamour of their mourning paſſed the gates of the city, and was heard throughout the camp.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh, by this time, were appriſed of what paſſed within Calais. They heard the voice of lamentation, and their ſouls were touched with compaſſion: each of the ſoldiers prepared a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own victuals to welcome and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the half famiſhed inhabitants; and they load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with as much as their preſent weakneſs was able to bear, in order to ſupply them with ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance by the way.</p>
            <p>At length, St. Pierre and his fellow victims ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, under the conduct of Sir Walter and a guard. All the tents of the Engliſh were inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly emptied. The ſoldiers poured from all parts, and arranged themſelves on each ſide, to behold, to contemplate, to admire this little band of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots as they paſſed. They murmured their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of that virtue, which they could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, even in enemies. And they regarded thoſe ropes, which they had voluntarily aſſumed about their necks, as enſigns of greater dignity than that of the Britiſh garter.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they had reached the preſence of the king—'Mauny!' ſays the monarch, 'are theſe the principal inhabitants of Calais?'—'They are,' ſays Mauny,
<q>they are not only the principal men of Calais, they are the principal men of France, my lord, if virtue has any ſhare in the act of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobling.</q>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:035333_0063_10022F3531CF53D8"/>
—'Were they delivered peaceably,' ſays Edward;
<q>was there no reſiſtance, no commotion among the people?</q>
               <q>Not in the leaſt, my lord; the people would all have periſhed, rather than have delivered the leaſt of theſe to your Majeſty. They are ſelf-delivered, ſelf-devoted, and come to offer up their ineſtimable heads as an ample equiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alent for the ranſom of thouſands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Edward was ſecretly piqued at this reply of Sir Walter, but he knew the privilege of a Britiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſuppreſſed his reſentment. 'Experience,' ſays he,
<q>hath ever ſhewn, that lenity only ſerves to invite people to new crimes. Severity, at times, is indiſpenſibly neceſſary to deter ſubjects into ſubmiſſion by puniſhment and example. Go,</q>
he cried to an officer,
<q>lead theſe men to execution—Your rebellion,</q>
continued he, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf to St. Pierre,
<q>your rebellion againſt me, the natural heir of your crown, is highly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by your preſent preſumption and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of my power.</q>
—
<q>We have nothing to aſk of your Majeſty,</q>
ſaid Euſtace,
<q>ſave what you cannot refuſe us.</q>
—'What is that?'
<q>Your eſteem, my lord,</q>
ſaid Euſtace, and went out with his companions.</p>
            <p>At this inſtant, a ſound of triumph was heard throughout the camp. The queen had juſt arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a powerful reinforcement of thoſe gallant ſoldiers, at the head of whom ſhe had conquered Scotland, and taken their king captive.</p>
            <p>Sir Walter Mauny flew to receive her Majeſty, and briefly informed her of the particulars reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſix victims.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="unknown:035333_0064_10022F36DC8719C0"/>As ſoon as ſhe had been welcomed by Edward and his court, ſhe deſired a private audience.
<q>My lord,</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q>the queſtion I am to enter upon is not touching the lives of a few mechanics; it reſpects a matter more eſtimable than the lives of all the natives of France; it reſpects the honour of the Engliſh nation, it reſpects the glory of my Edward, my huſband, my king.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You think you have ſentenced fix of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to death. No, my lord, they have ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced themſelves, and their execution would be the execution of their own orders, not the orders of Edward.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They have behaved themſelves worthily, they have behaved themſelves greatly; I cannot but reſpect, while I envy, while I hate them, for leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us no ſhare in the honour of this action, ſave that of granting a poor, an indiſpenſible pardon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I admit they have deſerved every thing that is evil at your hands. They have proved the moſt inveterate and efficacious of your enemies. They alone have withſtood the rapid courſe of your conqueſts, and have withheld from you the crown to which you were born. Is it therefore that you would reward them? that you would gratify their deſires, that you would indulge their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and enwreath them with everlaſting glory and applauſe?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But, if ſuch a death would exalt mechanics over the fame of the moſt illuſtrious heroes, how would the name of my Edward, with all his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs and honours, be tarniſhed thereby! Would
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035333_0065_10022F3945693930"/>
it not be ſaid, that magnanimity and virtue are grown odious in the eyes of the monarch of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? and the objects whom he deſtines to the puniſhment of felons, are the very men who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the praiſe and eſteem of mankind? The ſtage on which they ſhould ſuffer would be to them a ſtage of honour, but a ſtage of ſhame to Edward, a reproach to his conqueſts, a dark and indelible diſgrace to his name.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No, my lord. Let us rather diſappoint the ſaucy ambition of theſe burghers, who wiſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt themſelves with glory at our expence. We cannot, indeed, wholly deprive them of the me<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of a ſacrifice ſo nobly intended, but we may cut them ſhort of their deſires: in the place of that death by which their glory would be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, let us bury them under gifts, let us put them to ſhame with praiſes; we ſhall thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat them of that popular opinion, which never fails to attend thoſe who ſuffer in the cauſe of virtue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I am convinced; you have prevailed; be it ſo,</q>
cried Edward,
<q>prevent the execution; have them inſtantly before us!</q>
            </p>
            <p>They came, when the queen, with an aſpect and accents diffuſing ſweetneſs, thus beſpoke them:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Natives of France, and the inhabitants of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais, ye have put us to vaſt expence of blood and treaſure in the recovery of our juſt and natural inheritance; but you acted up to the beſt of an erroneous judgment, and we admire and honour in you that valour and virtue, by which we are ſo long kept out of our rightful poſſeſſions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:035333_0066_10022F3B927E6000"/>
               <q>You noble burghers, you excellent citizens! though you were tenfold the enemies of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and our throne, we can feel nothing on our part, ſave reſpect and affection for you. You have been ſufficiently teſted, we looſe your chains, we ſnatch you from the ſcaffold, and we thank you for that leſſon of humiliation, which you teach us, when you ſhew that excellence is not of blood, of title, or ſtation; that virtue gives a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſuperior to that of kings; and that thoſe, whom the Almighty informs with ſentiments like your's, are juſtly and eminently raiſed above all human diſtinctions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>You are now free to depart to your kinsfolk, your countrymen, to all thoſe whoſe lives and lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties you have ſo nobly redeemed, provided you refuſe not to carry with you the due tokens of our eſteem.</q>

                  <l>This day will be remarkable in my life</l>

            <p>IT was the voice of my love! ſeldom art thou in the dreams of Malvina! Open your airy halls, fathers of Toſcar of ſhields! Unfold the gates of your clouds: The ſteps of Malvina are near. I have heard a voice in my dream. I feel the fluttering of my ſoul. Why didſt thou come, O blaſt! from the dark rolling face of the lake? Thy ruſtling wing was in the tree; the dream of Malvina fled. But ſhe beheld her love, when his robe of miſt flew on the wind. A ſunbeam was on his ſkirts; they glittered like the gold of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. It was the voice of my love; ſeldom comes he to my dreams!</p>
            <p>But thou dwelleſt in the ſoul of Malvina, ſon of mighty Oſſian! my ſighs ariſe with the beams of the Eaſt; my tears deſcend with the drops of night. I was a lovely tree, in thy preſence, Oſcar! with all my branches round me; but thy death came like a blaſt from the deſert, and laid my green head

low. The Spring returned with its ſhowers; no leaf of mine aroſe! The virgins ſaw me ſilent in the hall: they touched the harp of joy. The tear was on the cheek of Malvina; the virgins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held me in my grief. Why art thou ſad, they ſaid, thou firſt of the maids of Lutha? Was he lovely as the beam of the morning, and ſtately in thy ſight?</p>
            <p>Pleaſant is thy ſong in Oſſian's ear, daughter of ſtreamy Lutha! Thou haſt heard the muſic of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted bards, in the dream of thy reſt, when ſleep fell on thine eyes, at the murmur of Moruth.— When thou didſt return from the chace, in the day of the Sun, thou haſt heard the muſic of bards, and thy ſong is lovely. It is lovely, O Malvina! but it melts the ſoul. There is a joy in grief, when peace dwells in the breaſt of the ſad. But ſorrow waſtes the mournful, O daughter of Toſcar; and their days are few! They fall away, like the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on which the ſun hath looked in his ſtrength, after the mildew has paſſed over it, when its head is heavy with the drops of the night. Attend to the tale of Oſſian, O maid! He remembers the days of his youth!</p>
            <p>The King commanded; I raiſed my ſails; and ruſhed into the bay of Croma; into Croma's ſounding bay, in lovely Inisfail. High on the coaſt aroſe the towers of Crothar, King of Spears; Crothar renowned in the battles of his youth; but age dwelt then around the chief. Rothmar had raiſed the ſword againſt the hero; and the wrath of Fingal burned. He ſent Oſſian to meet Roth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035333_0075_10022F57AE358B48"/>
in war; for the Chief of Croma was the friend of his youth. I ſent the bard before me with ſongs. I came into the hall of Crothar. There ſat the Chief amidſt the arms of his fathers; but his eyes had failed. His grey locks waved around a ſtaff, on which the warrior leaned. He hummed the ſongs of other times, when the ſound of our arms reached his ears. Crothar roſe, ſtretched his aged hand, and bleſſed the ſon of Fingal.</p>
            <p>Oſſian! ſaid the hero, the ſtrength of Crothar's arms has failed. O could I lift the ſword as in the day that Fingal fought at Strutha! He was the firſt of men! but Crothar had alſo his fame. The King of Morven praiſed me; he placed on my arm the boſſy ſhield of Calthar, whom the King had ſlain in his wars. Doſt thou not behold it on the wall, for Crothar's eyes have failed! Is thy ſtrength like thy father's, Oſſian? Let the aged feel thine arm!</p>
            <p>I gave my arm to the King; he felt it with his aged hands; the ſigh roſe in his breaſt, and his tears came down. Thou art ſtrong, my ſon, he ſaid; but not like the King of Morven! but who is like the hero among the mighty in war! Let the feaſt of my hall be ſpread; and let my bards exalt the ſong. Great is he that is within my walls, ye ſons of echoing Croma! The feaſt is ſpread; the harp is heard; and joy is in the hall. But it was joy covering a ſigh, that darkly dwelt in every breaſt. It was like the faint beam of the moon ſpread on a cloud in heaven. At length the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic ceaſed; and the aged King of Croma ſpoke:

He ſpoke without a tear, but ſorrow ſwelled in the midſt of his voice.</p>
            <p>Son of Fingal; beholdeſt thou not the darkneſs of Crothar's joy? My ſoul was not ſad at the feaſt, when my people lived before me. I rejoiced in the preſence of ſtrangers, when my ſon ſhone in the hall. But Oſſian, he is a beam that is departed. He left no ſtreak of light behind. He is fallen, ſon of Fingal! in the wars of his father. Roth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, the chief of graſſy Tromlo, heard that theſe eyes had failed; he heard that my arms were fixed in the hall, and the pride of his ſoul aroſe! He came towards Croma; my people fell before him. I took my arms in my wrath; but what could ſightleſs Crothar do? My ſteps were unequal; my grief was great. I wiſhed for days that were paſt. Days! wherein I fought and won in the field of blood. My ſon returned from the chaſe; the fair-haired Fovar-gormo. He had not lifted his ſword in battle, for his arm was young. But the ſoul of the youth was great; the fire of valour burned in his eyes. He ſaw the diſordered ſteps of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and his ſigh aroſe. King of Croma, he ſaid; is it becauſe thou haſt no ſon? is it for the weakneſs of Favor-gormo's arm, that thy ſighs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe? I begin, my father, to feel my ſtrength. I have drawn the ſword of my youth; and I have bent the bow. Let me meet this Rothmar, with the ſons of Croma: Let me meet him, O my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! I feel my burning ſoul. And thou ſhalt meet him, I ſaid, ſon of the ſightleſs Crothar! But let others advance before thee, that I may hear
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035333_0077_10022F5B92F7D5C0"/>
the tread of thy feet at thy return; for my eyes behold thee not, fair-haired Fovar-gormo!</p>
            <p>He went; he met the foe; he fell. Rothmar advances to Croma. He, who flew my ſon is near, with all his pointed ſpears.</p>
            <p>This is no time to fill the ſhell, I replied; and took my ſpear! My people ſaw the fire of my eyes; they all roſe around. Through night we ſtrode along the heath. Grey morning roſe in the Eaſt. A green narrow vale appeared before us; nor wanting was it in green winding ſtreams. The dark hoſt of Rothmar are on its banks, with all their glittering arms. We fought along the vale. They fled. Rothmar ſunk beneath my ſword! Day had not deſcended in the Weſt, when I brought his arms to Crothar. The aged hero felt them with his hands; and joy brightened over all his thoughts.</p>
            <p>The people gather to the hall. The ſhells of the feaſt are heard. Ten harps are ſtrung; five bards advance, and ſing by turns the praiſe of Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian. They poured forth their burning ſouls; and the ſtring anſwered to their voice. The joy of Croma was great; for peace returned to the land. The night came on with ſilence; the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned with joy. No foe came in darkneſs, with his glittering ſpear. The joy of Croma was great; for the gloomy Rothmar had fallen!</p>
            <p>I raiſed my voice for Fovar-gormo, when they laid the chief in earth. The aged Crothar was there, but his ſigh was not heard. He ſearched for the wound of his ſon, and found it in his breaſt.
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035333_0078_10022F5DDE71DA90"/>
Joy roſe in the face of the aged. He came and ſpoke to Oſſian. King of Spears! he ſaid; my ſon has not fallen without his fame. The young warrior did not fly; but met death, as he went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in his ſtrength. Happy are they, who die in youth, when their renown is heard! The feeble will not behold them in the hall, nor ſmile at their trembling hands. Their memory ſhall be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſong; the young tear of the virgin will fall: But the aged wither away by degrees; the fame of their youth, while yet they live, is all forgotten. They fall in ſecret. The ſigh of their ſon is not heard. Joy is around their tomb; the ſtone of their fame is placed without a tear. Happy are they who die in youth, when their renown is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them.</p>

            <p>THERE lived, in the province of Bretagne, a noble Baron, famous for his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and courtly hoſpitalities. His caſtle was graced with ladies of exquiſite beauty, and throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with illuſtrious knights; for the honors he paid to feats of chivalry invited the brave of diſtant countries to enter his liſts, and his court was more ſplendid than thoſe of many princes. Eight min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels were retained in his ſervice, who uſed to ſing to their harps romantic fictions, taken from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians, or adventures of chivalry, that befel knights during the cruſades, or the martial deeds of the Baron, their lord; while he, ſurrounded by his knights and ladies, banqueted in the great hall of his caſtle, where the coſtly tapeſtry, that adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the walls with pictured exploits of his anceſtors, the caſements of painted glaſs, enriched with armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial bearings, the gorgeous banners that waved along the roof, the ſumptuous canopies, the profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035333_0085_10022F6E0395C920"/>
of gold and ſilver that glittered on the ſide-boards, the numerous diſhes, that covered the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the number and gay liveries of the attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, with the chivalric and ſplendid attire of the gueſts, united to form a ſcene of magnificence, ſuch as we may not hope to ſee in theſe degenerate days.</p>
            <p>Of the Baron, the following adventure is relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. One night having retired late from the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet to his chamber, and diſmiſſed his attendants, he was ſurpriſed by the appearance of a ſtranger of a noble air, but of a ſorrowful and dejected coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. Believing, that this perſon had been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted in the apartment, ſince it appeared impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he could have lately paſſed the anti-room, unobſerved by the pages in waiting, who would have prevented this intruſion on their lord, the Baron, calling loudly for his people, drew his ſword, which he had not yet taken from his ſide, and ſtood upon his defence. The ſtranger ſlowly advancing, told him that there was nothing to fear; that he came with no hoſtile deſign, but to communicate to him a terrible ſecret, which it was neceſſary for him to know.</p>
            <p>The Baron, appeaſed by the courteous manners of the ſtanger, after ſurveying him for ſome time in ſilence, returned his ſword into the ſcabbard, and deſired him to explain the means, by which he had obtained acceſs to the chamber, and the purpoſe of this extraordinary viſit.</p>
            <p>Without anſwering either of theſe enquiries, the ſtranger ſaid, that he could not then explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:035333_0086_10022F6F92436A40"/>
but that, if the Baron would follow him to the edge of the foreſt, at a ſhort diſtance from the caſtle walls, he would there convince him, that he had ſomething of importance to diſcloſe.</p>
            <p>This propoſal again alarmed the Baron, who could ſcarcely believe, that the ſtranger meant to draw him to ſo ſolitary a ſpot, at this hour of the night, without harbouring a deſign againſt his life, and he refuſed to go, obſerving, at the ſame time, that, if the ſtranger's purpoſe was an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable one, he would not perſiſt in refuſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the occaſion of his viſit, in the apartment where they were.</p>
            <p>While he ſpoke this, he viewed the ſtranger ſtill more attentively than before, but obſerved no change in his countenance, or any ſympton, that might intimate a conſciouſneſs of evil deſign. He was habited like a knight, was of a tall and majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſtature, and of dignified and courteous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Still, however, he refuſed to communicate the ſubject of his errand in any place, but that he had mentioned, and, at the ſame time, gave hints concerning the ſecret he would diſcloſe, that awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened a degree of ſolemn curioſity in the Baron, which at length induced him to conſent to follow the ſtranger, on certain conditions.</p>
            <p>'Sir Knight,' ſaid he,
<q>I will attend you to the foreſt, and will take with me only four of my people, who ſhall witneſs our conference.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this, however, the Knight objected.</p>
            <p>'What I would diſcloſe,' ſaid he with ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<q>is to you alone. There are only three living

perſons, to whom the circumſtance is known; it is of more conſequence to you and your houſe, than I ſhall now explain. In future years you will look back to this night with ſatisfaction or repentance, accordingly as you now determine. As you would hereafter proſper—follow me; I pledge you the honour of a knight, that no evil ſhall befal you;—if you are contented to dare futurity, remain in your chamber, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part as I came.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Sir Knight,' replied the Baron,
<q>how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that my future peace can depend upon my preſent determination?</q>
            </p>
            <p>'That is not now to be told,' ſaid the ſtranger,
<q>I have explained myſelf to the utmoſt. It is late; if you follow me, it muſt be quickly;—you will do well to conſider the alternative.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baron muſed, and, as he looked upon the knight, he perceived his countenance aſſume a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſolemnity.</p>
            <p>The Baron paced his apartment, for ſome time, impreſſed by the laſt words of the ſtranger, whoſe extraordinary requeſt he feared to grant, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo to refuſe. At length he ſaid,
<q>Sir Knight, you are utterly unknown to me; tell me your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is it reaſonable, that I ſhould truſt myſelf alone with a ſtranger, at this hour, in a ſolitary foreſt? Tell me, at leaſt, who you are, and who aſſiſted to ſecrete you in this chamber.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The knight frowned at theſe latter words, and was a moment ſilent; then, with a countenance ſomewhat ſtern, he ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:035333_0088_10022F74291E0810"/>
               <q>I am an Engliſh knight; I am called Sir Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vys of Lancaſter—and my deeds are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known at the Holy City, whence I was returning to my native land, when I was benighted in the neighbouring foreſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Your name is not unknown to fame,' ſaid the Baron, 'I have heard of it.' (The knight looked haughtily.)
<q>But why, ſince my caſtle is known to entertain all true knights, did not your herald announce you? Why did you not appear at the banquet, where your preſence would have been welcomed, inſtead of hiding yourſelf in my caſtle and ſtealing to my chamber, at midnight!</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Stranger frowned, and turned away in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; But the Baron repeated the queſtions.</p>
            <p>'I come not,' ſaid the knight,
<q>to anſwer enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but to reveal facts. If you would know more, follow me, and again I pledge the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of a Knight, that you ſhall return in ſafety, Be quick in your determination—I muſt be gone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome further heſitation, the Baron deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to follow the ſtranger, and to ſee the reſult of his extraordinary requeſt; he therefore again drew forth his ſword, and, taking up a lamp, bade the knight lead on. The latter obeyed, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door of the chamber they paſſed into the anti-room, where the Baron, ſurpriſed to find all his pages aſleep, ſtopped, and, with haſty violence, was going to reprimand them for their careleſſneſs, when the knight waved his hand, and looked ſo expreſſively upon the Baron, that the latter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained his reſentment and paſſed on.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:035333_0089_10022F7673DE03E0"/>The knight, having deſcended a ſtaircaſe, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſecret door, which the Baron had believed was known only to himſelf, and, proceeding through ſeveral narrow and winding paſſages, came, at length, to a ſmall gate, that opened beyond the walls of the caſtle. Meanwhile the Baron followed in ſilence and amazement, on perceiving that theſe ſecret paſſages were ſo well known to a ſtranger, and felt inclined to return from an adventure, that appeared to partake of treachery, as well as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Then conſidering that he was armed, and obſerving the courteous and noble air of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor, his courage returned, he bluſhed, that it had failed him for a moment, and he reſolved to trace the myſtery to its ſource. He now found himſelf on the heathy platform, before his caſtle, where, looking up, he perceived lights glimmering in the different caſements of the gueſts, who were retiring to ſleep; and while he ſhivered in the blaſt, and looked on the dark and deſolate ſcene around him, he thought of the comforts of his warm chamber, rendered cheerful by the blaze of wood, and felt, for a moment, the full contraſt of his preſent ſituation.</p>
            <p>The wind was ſtrong, and the Baron watched his lamp with anxiety, expecting every moment to ſee it extinguiſhed; but, though the flame waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it did not expire, and he ſtill followed the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who often ſighed as he went, but did not ſpeak.</p>
            <p>When they reached the borders of the foreſt, the knight turned and raiſed his head, as if he
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:035333_0090_10022F78070DC558"/>
meant to addreſs the Baron, but then, cloſing his lips in ſilence, he walked on.</p>
            <p>As they entered beneath the dark and ſpreading bows, the Baron, affected by the ſolemnity of the ſcene, heſitated whether to proceed, and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how much further they were to go. The knight replied only by a geſture, and the Baron, with heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itating ſteps and a ſuſpicious eye, followed through an obſcure and intricate path, till, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a conſiderable way, he again demanded whither they were going, and refuſed to proceed unleſs he was informed.</p>
            <p>As he ſaid this, he looked at his own ſword, and at the knight alternately, who ſhook his head, and whoſe dejected countenance diſarmed the Baron, for a moment, of ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>A little further is the place, whither I would lead you,</q>
ſaid the ſtranger;
<q>no evil ſhall befall you—I have ſworn it on the honour of a knight.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baron, reaſſured, again followed in ſilence, and they ſoon arrived at a deep receſs of the foreſt, where the dark and lofty cheſtnuts entirely exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſky, and which was ſo overgrown with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood, that they proceeded with difficulty.— The knight ſighed deeply as he paſſed, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pauſed; and having at length reached a ſpot, where the trees crowded into a knot, he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and with a terrific look, pointing to the ground, the Baron ſaw there the body of a man, ſtretched at its length, and weltering in blood; a ghaſtly wound was on the forehead, and death appeared already to have contracted the features.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:035333_0091_10022F7BE8D4F8F0"/>The Baron, on perceiving the ſpectacle, ſtarted in horrour, looked at the knight for explanation, and was then going to raiſe the body, and examine if there were yet any remains of life; but the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, waving his hand, fixed upon him a look ſo earneſt and mournful, as not only much ſurpriſed him, but made him deſiſt.</p>
            <p>But what were the Baron's emotions, when, on holding the lamp near the features of the corpſe, he diſcovered the exact reſemblance of the ſtranger his conductor, to whom he now looked up in aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment and enquiry? As he gazed, he perceived the countenance of the knight change and begin to fade, till his whole form gradually vaniſhed from his aſtoniſhed ſenſe! While the Baron ſtood fixed to the ſpot, a voice was heard to utter theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>The body of Sir Bevys of Lancaſter, a noble Knight of England, lies before you. He was, this night, waylaid and murdered, as he journeyed from the Holy City towards his native land. Reſpect the honour of knighthood and the law of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; inter the body in Chriſtian ground, and cauſe his murderers to be puniſhed. As you obſerve, or neglect this, ſhall peace and happineſs, or war and miſery, light upon you and your houſe forever!</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Baron, when he recovered from the awe and aſtoniſhment, into which this adventure had thrown him, returned to his caſtle, whither he cauſed the body of Sir Bevys to be removed; and, on the following day, it was interred, with the honours of knighthood, in the chapel of the caſtle, attended by all the noble knights and ladies, who graced the court of the Baron St. Brunne.</p>

            <p>TOWARDS the latter end of the reign of Henry VIII. Sir Gawen, a man of ſome fortune and conſiderable curioſity, fond of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and inſatiate of knowledge, travelled through the northern counties of England. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſingle adventure is ſtill extant among the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily writings, and is ſtill recorded by his poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:035333_0101_10022F7993572430"/>It was towards ſun-ſet, (ſaith the manuſcript) when Sir Gawen, after having traverſed a very lone and unfrequented path, arrived at the edge of a thick and dark foreſt; the ſky was ſuddenly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, and it began to rain, the thunder rolled at a diſtance, and ſheets of livid lightning flaſhed acroſs the heath. Overcome with fatigue and hunger, he rode impatiently along the borders of the foreſt, in hopes of diſcovering an entrance, but none was to be found. At length, juſt as he was about to diſmount, with an intention of breaking the fence, he diſcerned as he thought, ſomething moving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the heath, and, upon advancing towards it, it proved to be an old woman gathering peat, and who, overtaken by the ſtorm, was hurrying home as faſt as her infirm limbs would carry her.</p>
            <p>The ſight of a human creature filled the heart of Sir Gawen with joy, and haſtily riding up, he enquired how far he had deviated from the right road, and where he could procure a night's lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The old woman now ſlowly lifted up her palſied head, and diſcovered a ſet of features, which could ſcarcely be called human; her eyes were red, piercing, and diſtorted, and, rolling horribly, glancing upon every object but the perform by whom ſhe was addreſſed, and, at intervals, they omitted a fiery diſagreeable light; her hair, of a dirty grey, hung matted with filth in large maſſes upon her ſhoulders, and a few thin portions ruſhed abrupt and horizontally from the upper part of her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which was much wrinkled, and of a parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hue; her cheeks were hollow, withered, and
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:035333_0102_10022F628C683560"/>
red with a quantity of acrid rheum; her noſe was large, prominent and ſharp, her lips thin, ſkinny and livid, her few teeth black, and her chin long and peaked, with a number of buſhy hairs depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from its extremity; her nails alſo were acute, crooked and bent over her fingers, and her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ragged and fluttering in the wind, diſplayed every poſſible variety of colour. The knight was a little daunted, but the old woman having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a dwelling at ſome diſtance, and offering to lead the way, the pleaſure received from this piece of news effaced the former impreſſion, and getting from his horſe, he laid hold of the bridle, and they ſlowly moved over the heath.</p>
            <p>The ſtorm had now ceaſed, and the moon riſing gave preſage of a fine night, juſt as the old woman, taking a ſudden turn, plunged into the wood by a path narrow and almoſt choaked up with a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of briar and thorn. The trees were thick, and ſave a few glimpſes of the moon, which now and then poured light on the uncouth features of his companion, all was dark and diſmal; the heart of Sir Gawen miſgave him; neither ſpoke, and the knight purſued his guide merely by the noiſe ſhe made in hurrying through the buſhes, which was done with a celerity totally inconſiſtent with her former decrepitude. At length the path grew wider, and a faint blue light, which came from a building at ſome diſtance, glimmered before them; they now left the wood, and iſſued upon a rocky and uneven piece of ground; the moon ſtruggling through a cloud, caſt a doubtful and uncertain
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:035333_0103_10022F4B29AEA398"/>
light, and the old woman, with a leer, which made the very hair of Sir Gawen ſtand an end, told him that the dwelling was at hand. It was ſo; for a Gothic caſtle, placed on a conſiderable elevation, now came in view; it was a large maſſy ſtructure, much decayed, and ſome parts of it in a totally ruinous condition; a portion, however, of the keep, or great tower, was ſtill entire, as was alſo the entrance to the court or incloſure, preſerved probably by the ivy, whoſe fibres crept round with ſolicitous care. Large fragments of the ruin were ſcattered about, covered with moſs, and half ſunk in the ground, and a number of old elm trees, through whoſe foliage the wind ſighed with a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and melancholy ſound, dropped a deep and ſettled gloom, that ſcarce permitted the moon to ſtream by fits upon the building.</p>
            <p>Sir Gawen drew near; ardent curioſity, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with awe, dilated his boſom, and he inwardly congratulated himſelf upon ſo ſingular an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when turning round to queſtion his compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, a glimpſe of the moon poured full upon his eye ſo horrid a contexture of feature, ſo wild and preternatural a combination, that, ſmote with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and unable to move, a cold ſweat trickled from every pore, and immediately this infernal being, ſeizing him by the arm, and hurrying him over the draw-bridge to the great entrance of the keep, the portcullis fell with a tremendous ſound, and the knight, ſtarting as it were from a trance, drew his ſword in act to deſtroy his treacherous guide, when inſtantly a horrible and infernal laugh
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:035333_0104_10022F42B3281D78"/>
burſt from her, and in a moment the whole caſtle was in an uproar, peal after peal iſſuing from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quarter, till at length growing faint, they died away, and a dead ſilence enſued.</p>
            <p>Sir Gawen, who, during this ſtrange tumult, had collected all his ſcattered powers, now looked round him with determined reſolution; his terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble companion had diſappeared, and the moon ſhining full upon the portcullis, convinced him that any eſcape that way was impracticable; the wind ſighed through the elms; the ſcared owl, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his diſcordant note, broke from the ruſtling bough, and a dim twinkling light beamed from a loop-hole near the ſummit of the great tower. Sir Gawen entered the keep, having previouſly reaſoned himſelf into a ſtate of cool fortitude, and bent up every power to the appalling enterpriſe. He extended his ſword before him, for it was dark, and proceeded carefully to ſearch around, in hopes either of diſcovering ſome aperture, which might lead to the veſtibule or ſtaircaſe, or of wreaking his vengeance on the wretch, who had thus decoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. All was ſtill as death: but as he ſtrode over the floor, a dull, hollow ſound iſſued from beneath, and rendered him apprehenſive of falling through into ſome diſmal vault, from which he might never be able to extricate himſelf. In this ſituation, dreading the effect of each light footſtep, a ſound, as of many people whiſpering, ſtruck his ear; he bent forward liſtening with eager attention, and as it ſeemed to proceed from a little diſtance before him, he determined to follow it: he did ſo,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:035333_0105_100230EFCF0CE3D8"/>
and inſtantly fell through the mouldering pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilſt at the ſame time peals of horrid laughter again burſt with reiterated clamour from every chamber of the caſtle. Sir Gawen roſe with conſiderable difficulty, and much ſtunned with the fall, although fortunately the ſpot he had dropped upon was covered with a quantity of damp and ſoft earth, which gave way to his weight. He now found himſelf in a large vault, arched in the Gothic manner, and ſupported by eight maſſy pillars, down whoſe ſides the damp moiſture ran in cold and heavy drops, the moon ſhining with great luſtre through three iron-grated windows, which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ruſty with age, were ſtrong enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the efforts of Sir Gawen, who, after having in vain tried to force them, looked around for his ſword, which during the fall had ſtarted from his graſp, and in ſearching the ground with his fingers, he laid hold of, and drew forth the freſh bones of an enormous ſkeleton, yet greaſy and moiſt from the decaying fibres: he trembled with horror— a cold wind bruſhed violently along the ſurface of the vault, and a ponderous iron door, ſlowly grating on its hinges, opened at one corner, and diſcloſed to the wandering eye of Sir Gawen a broken ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, down whoſe ſteps a blue and faint light flaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fits, like the lightning of a ſummer's eve. Appalled by theſe dreadful prodigies, Sir Gawen felt, in ſpite of all his reſolution, a cold and death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like chill pervade his frame, and kneeling down, he prayed fervently to that power, without whoſe mandate no being is let looſe upon another, and
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035333_0106_1001FE55ED41B568"/>
feeling himſelf more calm and reſolved, he again began to ſearch for his ſword, when a moonbeam falling on the blade, at once reſtored it to its own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p>Sir Gawen having thus reſumed his wonted for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and reſolution, held a parley with himſelf, and perceiving no other way by which he could eſcape, boldly reſolved to brave all the terrors of the ſtaircaſe, and, once more recommending him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to his Maker, began to aſcend. The light ſtill flaſhed, enabling him to climb thoſe parts which were not broken or decayed. He had proceeded in this manner a conſiderable way, mounting, as he ſuppoſed, to the ſummit of the keep, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly a ſhrill and agonizing ſhriek iſſued from the upper part of it, and ſomething rudely bruſhing down, graſped him with tremendous ſtrength; in a moment he became motionleſs, cold as ice, and felt himſelf hurried back by ſome irreſiſtible being; but juſt as he had reached the vault, a ſpectre of ſo dreadful a ſhape ſtalked by within it, that ſtraining every muſcle, he ſprang from the deadly graſp: the iron door ruſhed in thunder upon its hinges, and a deep hollow groan reſounded from beneath. No ſooner had the door cloſed, than yelling ſcreams and ſounds, which almoſt ſuſpended the very pulſe of life, iſſued from the vault, as if a troop of helliſh furies, with their chains united, were daſhing them in writhing frenzy, and howling to the uproar. Sir Gawen ſtood petrified with horror, a ſtony fear ran to his very heart, and diſmayed every ſenſe about him; he ſtared wide with his long locks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035333_0107_100230E02FC7C7F0"/>
ſtiffly, and the throbbing of his heart op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed him. The tumult at length ſubſiding, Sir Gawen recovered ſome portion of ſtrength, which he immediately made uſe of to convey himſelf as far as poſſible from the iron door, and preſently reaching his former elevation on the ſtaircaſe, which, after aſcending a few more ſteps, termin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in a winding gallery. The light, which had hitherto flaſhed inceſſantly, now diſappeared, and he was left in almoſt total darkneſs, except that now and then the moon threw a few cool rays through ſome broken loop-holes, heightening the horrour of the ſcene. He dreaded going forward, and fearfully looked back, leſt ſome yelling fiend ſhould again plunge him into the vault. He ſtood ſuſpended with apprehenſion; a mournful wind howled through the apartments of the caſtle, and liſtening, he thought he heard the iron door grate upon its hinges; he ſtarted with terrour, the ſweat ſtood in big drops upon his forehead, his knees ſmote each other, and he ruſhed forward with deſperate deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, till having ſuddenly turned a corner of the gallery, a taper, burning with a faint light, gleam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a narrow dark paſſage: Sir Gawen approached the light; it came from an extenſive room, the folding doors of which were wide open: he entered; a ſmall taper in a maſſy ſilver candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick ſtood upon a table in the middle of the room, but gave ſo inconſiderable an illumination, that the one end was wrapped in palpable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the other ſcarcely broken in upon by a dim light, that ſtreamed through a large ramified

window, covered with thick ivy. An arm-chair, ſhattered and damp with age, was placed near the table, and the remains of a recent fire were ſtill viſible in the grate. The wainſcot, of black oak, had formerly been hung with tapeſtry, and ſeveral portions ſtill clung to thoſe parts, which were near the fire; they poſſeſſed ſome vivacity of teint, and with much gilding, yet apparent on the chimney-piece, and ſeveral mouldering reliques of coſtly frames and paintings, gave indiſputable evidence of the ancient grandeur of the place.</p>
            <p>Sir Gawen cloſed the folding doors, and, taking the taper, was about to ſurvey the room, when a deep hollow groan from the dark end of it ſmote cold upon his heart; at the ſame time the ſound, as of ſomething falling with a dead weight, echo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the room. Sir Gawen replaced the taper, the flame of which was agitated, now quiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering, ſunk, now ſtreaming, flamed aloft, and as the laſt pale portion died away, the ſcarce diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed form of ſome terrific being floated ſlowly by, and again another dreadful groan ran deepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the gloom. Sir Gawen ſtood for ſome time incapable of motion, at length ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning all his fortitude, he advanced with his ſword extended to the darkeſt part of the room: inſtantly burſt forth in fierce irradiations a blue ſulphureous ſplendour, and the mangled body of a man diſtorted with the agony of death, his very fibres racked with convulſion, his beard and hair ſtiff and matted with blood, his mouth open, and his eyes protruding from their marble ſockets,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:035333_0109_100230CFAF58D598"/>
ruſhed on the fixed and maddening ſenſes of Sir Gawen, whoſe heart had beat no more, had not a hiſs, as of ten thouſand fiends, loud, horrible, rouſed him from the dreadful ſcene; he ſtarted, uttering a wild ſhriek, his brain turned round, and running he knew not whither, burſt through the folding doors.</p>
            <p>Darkneſs again ſpread her ſable pall over the unfortunate Sir Gawen, and he hurried along the narrow paſſage with a feeble and faultering ſtep. His intellect ſhook, and, overwhelmed with the late appalling objects, had not yet recovered any degree of recollection, and as he wandered in a dream, a confuſed train of horrible ideas paſſing unconnected through his mind: at length, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, memory reſumed her function, reſumed it but to daunt him with harrowing ſuggeſtions; the direful horrors of the room behind, and of the vault below, were ſtill preſent to his eyes, and as a man whom helliſh fiends had frightened, he ſtood trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, pale, and ſtaring wild.</p>
            <p>All was now ſilent and dark, and he determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to wait in this ſpot the dawn of day; but a few minutes had ſcarce elapſed, when the iron door, ſcreaming on its hinges, bellowed through the murmuring ruin. Sir Gawen nearly fainted at the ſound, which pauſing for ſome time, again ſwelled upon the wind, and at laſt died away in ſhrill mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy ſhrieks; again all was ſilent, and again the ſame fearful noiſe ſtruck terrour to his ſoul. Whilſt he was thus agitated with horrour and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, a dim light ſtreaming from behind, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:035333_0110_1001FE511140D6F0"/>
with a ſoft, quick, and hollow tread, convinced Sir Gawen that ſomething was purſuing him, and ſtruck with wildering fear, he ruſhed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious down the ſteps; the vault received him, and its portal ſwinging to their cloſe, ſounded as the ſentence of death. A dun, faetid ſmoke filled the place, in the centre of which aroſe a faint and bickering flame. Sir Gawen approached and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a corſe ſuſpended over it by the neck, its fat dropped, and a flame flaſhing through the vault, gleamed on a throng of hideous and ghaſtly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that now came forward through the ſmoke. Sir Gawen, with the deſperate valour of a man, who ſees deſtruction before him, ran furious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; an univerſal ſhriek burſt forth; the corſe dropped into the fire, which riſing with tenfold brilliance, placed full in view the dreadful form of his infernal guide, dilated into horrour itſelf; her face was as pale as death, her eyes were wide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, dead and fixed, a horrible grin ſat upon her features; her lips black, and half putrid, were drawn back, diſcloſing a ſet of large blue teeth, and her hair, ſtanding ſtiffly erect, was of a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered red. Sir Gawen felt his blood freeze within him, his limbs forgot to move, the face, enlarging as it came, drew near, and, ſwooning, he fell for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on the ground.</p>
            <p>Slow paſſed the vital fluid through the boſom of Sir Gawen, ſcarce did the heart vibrate to its impulſe; on his pallid forehead ſat a chilly ſweat and frequent ſpaſms ſhook his limbs; but at length returning warmth gave ſome vigour to his
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:035333_0111_100230B6BAB76710"/>
frame, the energy of life became more ſuffuſed, a ſoothing languor ſtole upon him, and on opening his eyes, ruſhed neither the images of death or the rites of witchcraft, but the ſoft, the ſweet and tranquil ſcenery of a ſummer's moon-light night. Enraptured with this ſudden and unexpected change, Sir Gawen roſe gently from off the ground, over his head towered a large and majeſtic oak, at whoſe foot, by ſome kind and compaſſionate being he concluded he had been laid. Delight and gratitude dilated his heart, and advancing from beneath the tree, whoſe gigantic branches ſpread a large extent of ſhade, a vale, beautiful and romantic, through which ran a clear and deep ſtream, came full in view; he walked to the edge of the water, the moon ſhone with mellow luſtre on its ſurface, and its banks fringed with ſhrubs, breathed a perfume more delicate than the odours of the Eaſt. On one ſide, the ground, covered with a vivid, ſoft, and downy verdure ſtretched for a conſiderable extent to the borders of a large for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, which ſweeping round, finally cloſed up the valley, on the other, it was broken into abrupt and rocky maſſes ſwarded with moſs, and from whoſe clefts grew thick and ſpreading trees, the roots of which, waſhed by many a fall of water, hung bare and matted from their craggy beds.</p>
            <p>Sir Gawen forgot in this delicious vale, all his former ſufferings, and giving up his mind to the pleaſing influence of curioſity and wonder, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to explore the place by tracing the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſtream. Scarce had he entered upon
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:035333_0112_100230B2DBCF1848"/>
this plan, when muſic of the moſt raviſhing ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs filled the air, ſometimes it ſeemed to float a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the valley, ſometimes it ſtole along the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the water, now it died away among the woods, and now with deep and mellow ſymphony it ſwelled upon the gale. Fixed in aſtoniſhment, Sir Gawen ſcarce ventured to breathe; every ſenſe, ſave that of hearing, ſeemed quite abſorbed, and when the laſt faint warblings melted on his ear, he ſtarted from the ſpot, ſolicitous to know from what being thoſe more than human ſtrains had parted; but nothing appeared in view; the moon full and unclouded, ſhone with unuſual luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, the white rocks glittered in her beam, and, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with hope, he again purſued the windings of the water, which conducting to the narroweſt part of the valley, continued their courſe through the wood. Sir Gawen entered by a path, ſmooth, but narrow and perplexed, where, although its branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were ſo numerous that no preference could be given, or any direct route long perſiſted in, yet every turn preſented ſomething to amuſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſharpen the edge of reſearch. The beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the trees, through whoſe interſtices the moon gleamed in the moſt pictureſque manner: the glimpſes of the water, and the notes of the night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingale, who now began to fill the valley with her ſong, were more than ſufficient to take off the ſenſe of fatigue, and he wandered on ſtill eager to explore, ſtill panting for further diſcovery. The wood now became more thick and obſcure, and at length almoſt dark, when the path taking ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:035333_0113_1001FE49008F3428"/>
an oblique direction, Sir Gawen found himſelf on the edge of a circular lawn, whoſe teint and ſoftneſs were beyond compare, and which ſeemed to have been lightly bruſhed by fairy feet. A number of fine old trees, around whoſe boles crept the ivy and the woodbine, roſe at irregular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, here they mingled into groves, and there ſeparate, and emulous of each other, they ſhook their airy ſummits in diſdain. The water, which had been for ſome time concealed, now murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a thouſand beds and viſiting each lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flower, added vigour to its vegetation, and poignancy to its fragrance. Along the edges of the wood and beneath the ſhadows of the trees, an innumerable hoſt of glow-worms lighted their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocuous fires, luſtrous as the gems of Golconda, and Sir Gawen, deſirous yet longer to enjoy the ſcene, went forward with light footſteps on the lawn; all was calm, and, except the breeze of night, that ſighed ſoft and ſweetly through a world of leaves, a perfect ſilence prevailed. Not many minutes, however, had elapſed, before the ſame enchanting muſic, to which he had liſtened with ſo much rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the vale, again arreſted his ear, and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he diſcovered on the border of the lawn, juſt riſing above the wood, and floating on the boſom of the air, a being of the moſt delicate form; from his ſhoulders ſtreamed a tunic of the tendereſt blue, his wings and feet were clothed in downy ſilver, and in his graſp he had a wand, white as the mountain ſnow. He roſe ſwiftly in the air, his brilliance became exceſſive from the lunar rays, his

ſong echoed through the vault of night, but having quickly diminiſhed to the ſize and appearance of the evening ſtar, it died away, and the next mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was loſt in aether. Sir Gawen ſtill fixed his eye on that part of the heavens, where the viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion had diſappeared, and ſhortly had the pleaſure of again ſeeing the ſtar-like radiance, which in an inſtant unfolded itſelf into the full and fine dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the beauteous being, who having collected dew from the cold vales of Saturn, now deſcended rapidly towards the earth, and waving his wand, as he paſſed athwart the woods, a number of like form and garb, flew round him, and all alighting on the lawn, ſeparated at equal diſtances on its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, and then ſhaking their wings, which ſpread a perfume through the air, burſt into one general ſong. Sir Gawen, who apprehenſive of being diſcovered, had retreated within the ſhadow of ſome moſſy oaks, now waited with eager expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the event of ſo ſingular a ſcene. In a few moments a bevy of elegant nymphs, dancing two by two, iſſued from the wood on the right, and an equal number of warlike knights, accompanied by a band of minſtrels, from that of the left. The knights were clothed in green; on their boſoms ſhone a plate of burniſhed ſteel, and in their hands they graſped a golden targe and lance of beamy luſtre. The nymphs, whoſe form and ſymmetry were beyond whatever poets dream, were dreſſed in robes of white, their zones were azure, dropt with diamonds, and their light brown hair decked with roſes hung in ample ringlets. So quick, ſo
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:035333_0115_100230A334AF7128"/>
light and airy was their motion, that the turf, the flowers ſhrunk not to the gentle preſſure, and each ſmiling on her favourite knight, he ſlung his bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant arms aſide, and mingled in the dance.</p>
            <p>Whilſt thus they flew in rapid meaſures over the lawn. Sir Gawen, forgetting his ſituation, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to ſalute the aſſembly, involuntarily ſtepped forward, and inſtantaneouſly a ſhrill and hollow guſt of wind murmured through the woods, the moon dipt into a cloud, and the knights, the dames and aerial ſpirits vaniſhed from his view, leaving the amazed Sir Gawen to repent at leiſure of his precipitate intruſion; ſcarce, however, had he time to determine what he ſhould purſue, when a gleam of light flaſhed ſuddenly along the horizon, and the beauteous being, whom he firſt beheld in the air, ſtood before him; he waved his ſnowy wand, and pointing to the wood, which now appeared ſparkling with a thouſand fires, moved gently on. Sir Gawen felt an irreſiſtible impulſe which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to follow, and having penetrated the wood, he perceived many bright rays of light, which, darting like the beams of the ſun, through every part of it, moſt beautifully illuminated the ſhafts of the trees. As they advanced forwards the radiance became more intenſe and converged towards the centre; and the fairy being turning quickly round, commanded Sir Gawen to kneel down and having ſqueezed the juice of an herb into his eyes, bade him now proceed, but that no mortal eye, unleſs its powers of viſion were increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could endure the glory that would ſhortly burſt
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:035333_0116_100230A0E6DAC700"/>
upon them. Scarce had he uttered theſe words, when they entered an amphitheatre; In its centre was a throne of ivory inlaid with ſapphires, on which ſat a female form of exquiſite beauty, a plain coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of gold obliquely croſſed her flowing hair, and her robe of white ſattin hung negligent in ample folds. Around her ſtood five and twenty nymphs clothed in white and gold, and holding lighted ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; beyond theſe were fifty of the aerial beings, their wings of downy ſilver ſtretched for flight, and each a burning taper in his hand; and laſtly, on the circumference of the amphitheatre ſhone one hundred knights in mail of tempered ſteel, in one hand they ſhook aloft a large targe of maſſy dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and in the other flaſhed a taper. So exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive was the reflection, that the targes had the luſtre of a hundred ſuns, and when ſhaken, ſent forth ſcreams of vivid lightning; from the gold, the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the ſapphires ruſhed a flood of tinted light, that mingling, threw upon the eye a ſeries of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving hues.</p>
            <p>Sir Gawen impreſſed with awe, with wonder and delight, fell proſtrate on the ground, whilſt the fairy ſpirit advancing, knelt and preſented to the queen a chryſtal vaſe. She roſe, ſhe waved her hand, and ſmiling, bade Sir Gawen to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. 'Gentle ſtranger,' ſhe exclaimed,
<q>let not fear appal thine heart for to him, whom cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, truth and piety have diſtinguiſhed, our friendſhip and our love is given. Spirits of the bleſt we are, our ſweet employment is to befriend the wretched and the weary, to lull the torture of
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:035333_0117_1002309B6FB37CA0"/>
anguiſh, and the horrour of deſpair. Ah! never ſhall the tear of innocence or the plaint of ſorrow, the pang of injured merit, or the ſigh of hopeleſs love, implore our aid in vain. Upon the moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam do we float, and light as air, pervade the habitations of men, and hearken, O favoured mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal! I tell thee, ſpirits pure from vice are preſent to thy inmoſt thoughts; when terrour and when madneſs, when ſpectres and when death ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee, our influence put to flight the miniſters of darkneſs; we placed thee in the moon-light vale, and now upon thy head I pour the planetary dew, from Hecate's dread agents, it will free thee from wildering fear and gloomy ſuperſtition.</q>
            </p>
            <p>She ended, and Sir Gawen, impatient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his gratitude, was about to ſpeak, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the light turned pale, and died away, the ſpirits fled, and muſick ſoft and ſweet was heard remotely in the air. Sir Gawen ſtarted, and in place of the refulgent ſcene of magic, he beheld a public road, his horſe cropping the graſs, which grew upon its edge, and a village at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, on whoſe ſpire the riſing ſun had ſhed his earlieſt beams.</p>

            <head>THE CAVE OF MODRED. A BRITISH STORY.</head>
            <p>WHEN the all conquering ſword of the Romans had penetrated into the Southern part of Wales, and enſanguined the hoſtile plain with the blood of her moſt diſtinguiſhed heroes, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, the ſage, ſought a retreat from the deſolating rage of war; he was a Druid, renowned for his piety and wiſdom; yet he had lived to ſee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altar beſprinkled with the blood of its prieſts, and the ſacred groves polluted by the crimes of a licentious ſoldiery!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="unknown:035333_0126_10023070386489E8"/>The aſylum he choſe was a ſpacious cave, divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hand of nature into a variety of apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: an obſcure path led to it by a gentle deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and by a variety of intricate windings ſeemed to pronounce it inacceſſible, but to thoſe whom the friendly hand of the Druid guided: thus ſequeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, it formed a retreat for innocence and virtue.</p>
            <p>Here the tender virgin fled to eſcape violation, and the modeſt matron inſult; and here the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow and the fatherleſs ſought protection and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, here too the hardy veteran, covered with wounds, oftimes repaired from the battle, and healed by the ſage's pious care, returned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſtrength and vigour to the fight. Every morn and eve, Modred was ſeen proſtrate beneath a venerable grove of oak, which graced the ſide of a hill, that roſe at a ſmall diſtance from his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there he erected the ſacred altar, and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the cuſtom of his revered anceſtors, laid on it the ſacred oblation of meal. Thus paſſed his days in prayer, contemplation, and acts of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. His drink was from a clear ſtreamlet, that diſtilled from the rock, out of which his rude dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was formed, and his food ſalubrious herbs, which grew within the precincts of his habitation.— Such was Modred, the Druid; in whom the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of childhood, and the wiſdom of old age, were obſerved to unite.</p>
            <p>One day having wandered beyond the bounds he uſually preſcribed himſelf, in purſuit of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal herbs, he obſerved the ground to be diſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſeveral drops of blood, and perceiving, a
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035333_0127_10023069365C5DD8"/>
few paces further, that it widened into a tract of conſiderable dimenſions, his humanity prompted him to follow it. It led him to a ſpot of ground, on which a perſon in armour lay extended; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be in a ſwoon, and his beaver being up, Modred could diſcern that he was in the flower of his age.</p>
            <p>The Druid perceived by his armour, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Roman army; but compaſſion for the helpleſs ſtate in which he beheld him, cauſed him, at that inſtant, to forget all animoſity; he raiſed him in his arms, and applied a ſovereign cordial, that he always carried about him, to his lips, a few drops of which greatly revived him, but he was nevertheleſs ſo extremely exhauſted from loſs of blood, that he in vain attempted to riſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his feet. Modred, finding the ſtranger incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of riſing, without other aſſiſtance than he was able to give, haſtened back to the cavern, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with all ſpeed, accompanied by Oſcar:— Oſcar was the moſt valiant of all the Britiſh youths, who fearleſs lifted the ſword in defence of liberty. His courage had been manifeſt in many battles, which he had ſought with the common enemy, and it was united with clemency and generoſity. By the aſſiſtance of this youth, the ſtranger was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to Modred's cavern; but as he was a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, they firſt took the precaution to blind-fold him, leſt, being an enemy, he ſhould make obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions relative to the ſituation of the place, which might hereafter prove to their diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:035333_0128_100230630DE76AF0"/>Having conducted him into the cavern, they took the bandage from his eyes, unbraced his armour, and laid him on a couch of the ſofteſt moſs; the Druid then examined his wounds, which he found by care might ſpeedily be healed, and applying to them ſome herbs, which he knew to be of the moſt ſovereign efficacy, left him awhile to his repoſe. An hour being elapſed, he renewed his viſit, and found the ſtranger ſo much recovered by the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies applied to his wounds, together with a gentle ſleep, from which, on Modred's entrance he awoke, that he was able, in a faint voice, to enquire into whoſe hands he had fallen; but preſently recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were Britons, he teſtified by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that he expected little mercy at their hands.</p>
            <p>The Druid, gueſſing at what paſſed in his mind, endeavoured to diſpel his apprehenſions: 'Youth,' ſaid he,
<q>you are in the hands of thoſe, whom your nation calls barbarians, but though ſtrangers to the ſpecious arts uſed by civilized nations to gloſs over the baſeſt deſigns, the Britons are not unacquainted with the virtues of hoſpitality and humanity. They love victory, but they delight not in blood; diſpel your fears, therefore, and reſt aſſured, that while you remain in the cave of Modred, the Druid, you ſhall be ſecure from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or inſult.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the morning, the Druid found his gueſt wonderfully recovered; who informed him, that he was an officer in the Roman army; that he had left the camp, which was ſtationed within a day's march of that place, in company with five
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035333_0129_1002305E7253D5B8"/>
other of the troop; their deſign being, he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to make diſcoveries concerning the ſtate of the enemy; but his men being, as he imagined, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned by a brother officer, between whom and himſelf, there had been ſome trifling difference, they had baſely turned their arms againſt him, and left him for dead on the ſpot, where the Druid firſt diſcovered him. He expreſſed the warmeſt acknowledgements for the kind treatment he had received, and, at Modred's requeſt, followed him to the outward part of the cave, where a number of perſons, of different ſex and age, were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, being that morning returned from ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>Among theſe, the ſuperiour beauty of the fair Elſimena, arreſted the attention of the young Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Her ſtature aroſe conſiderably above her companions, and, like her features, was formed with the moſt exact ſymmetry; a thouſand beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties played round her mouth; her cheek diſcloſed a tincture pure as the opening roſe; and her hair floated over her ſhoulders, in all the wild negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of nature. From the playful hours of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, Elſimena had known no other parent, than Modred; to his care, a mother's dying breath had bequeathed her, and the pious ſage religiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the ſacred truſt repoſed in him. He watched over her with the attention and care of a fond parent, and received from Elſimena the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful return of filial tenderneſs and obedience. Oſcar had long reſigned his heart at the ſhrine of Elſime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's beauty, nor was the fair maid inſenſible of his
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:035333_0130_10023058056009A0"/>
merit; on the contrary, Oſcar beheld her affections captive; ſhe burned with an equal flame, and a ſhort period was to ſee them united.</p>
            <p>Oſcar, not without uneaſineſs, beheld his miſtreſs expoſed to the rapturous gaze of the young Roman; he obſerved that her charms touched his ſoul; and feared his noble mien and gallant deportment might cauſe Elſimena to draw between them a compariſon not to his own advantage; but theſe modeſt apprehenſions were diſſipated, when he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the coolneſs and reſerve with which ſhe repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his civilities; and how ſolicitous ſhe was to diſengage herſelf from his converſation. Claudius, for that was the name of the Roman, became eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment more enamoured of Elſimena; in the ſimple attire of a Britiſh maid, his heart confeſſed that ſhe eclipſed the faireſt Roman; but he had the mortification to find that ſhe was inſenſible to every thing he could urge in behalf of his paſſion, and that her heart was ſolely devoted to Oſcar.</p>
            <p>Three days inſenſibly glided away, which the enamoured Claudius, happy in the preſence of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimena, thought no more than as many hours; but the Druid finding him reſtored to his former vigour, reminded him that it was time to depart: 'We have now,' ſaid Modred,
<q>diſcharged the debt, which humanity exacted from us, in your behalf; we have received you beneath our roof, and the ſacred laws of hoſpitality, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, forbid us to exert to your diſadvantage, that power which we derive not from the ſtrength of our arms, or the chance of war, but by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:035333_0131_100230511396F038"/>
calamity of our enemy; but now that you no longer claim our ſufference, it is time that you depart, ſince we can no longer entertain you but as the enemy of our country, the baſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaver of our rights and liberties: as ſuch, a Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot, without reproach, hold amicable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The young Roman expreſſed the higheſt ſenſe of the Druid's generoſity, and lamented that he was conſtrained to bear arms againſt a country to which he was indebted for his life, and, what was ſtill dearer, his liberty.</p>
            <p>While Claudius thus expreſſed himſelf, the Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id tied a bandage over his eyes, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as when he firſt brought him to the cave, and then, with a generoſity ſcarcely to be paralleled, conſigned him to the care of Oſcar, who waited to conduct him in ſafety to the place where they found him.</p>
            <p>During the time that Claudius was entertained in the cave of Modred, the Britons having received intelligence that the Romans were on their march to attack them, were making great preparations for a vigorous defence: on the third day, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies encamped within ſight of each other, and on the morning of the fourth, were drawn up in order for battle.</p>
            <p>Elſimena having, with an aching heart, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the farewell of her beloved Oſcar, retired to the pious Druid, who, beneath the covert of a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated grove, (which, as it ſtood on a riſing ground, commanded a diſtant view of the plain, where the
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:035333_0132_1001FE3DE9626BE0"/>
two armies were to engage) offered ſacrifice to the gods for the ſucceſs of the Britiſh arms.</p>
            <p>The two armies engaged with equal fury, and for a long time it was doubtful on which ſide vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory would terminate: Elſimena, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of the grove, beheld her lover ruſh into the midſt of the battle, with a courage and reſolution truly heroic; but when he leaped from the chariot to engage the enemy ſword in hand, ſhe ſtretched her aching eyes in vain, to diſtinguiſh him from the croud of gallant heroes, who united againſt the common foe.</p>
            <p>The fight was long and deſperate, but the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour number of the Romans at length prevailed; the flower of the warlike Silures were ſlain, or tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en priſoners, and the reſt obliged to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by flight.</p>
            <p>Elſimena anxiouſly enquired of the Britons, who fled toward the hills for ſhelter from the victorious enemy, concerning her lover, and with anguiſh heard the gallant youth had fallen among the ſlain; frantic with grief, ſhe ſnatched a ſword from one of them: 'How! my brave countrymen,' ſaid ſhe,
<q>will you ſuffer the gallant heroes, who fought with you this day, in defence of our liberties, to fall unrevenged? For my part, I am reſolved to fell my life dearly, and not till I have myſelf had the conſolation of a dying ſword in the blood of our enemies.</q>
Saying thus, like an arrow from a bow, ſhe deſcended the hill, and urged on by deſpair, ruſhed into the midſt of the enemy, who had now gained the foot of it, in purſuit of the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:035333_0133_1002304ADE351010"/>
Britons, reſolving, if ſhe could not revenge the death of her lover, at leaſt to periſh in the attempt.</p>
            <p>The Britons, animated by the conduct of Elſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena, once more faced the enemy; aſhamed of being ſurpaſſed in courage by a woman, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked them with redoubled fury, and though the ſuperiour numbers of the latter rendered all hope of victory abortive, to the great loſs of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, they fought till either they were ſlain, or made priſoners. The Druid was, in the mean while, not an inactive ſpectator of this ſcene; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with a glorious enthuſiaſm, he ſeized the reins of a chariot, and vaulting into the ſeat, drove, with a deſperate fury, into the midſt of the fight, cutting down all before him, and repeatedly diſcharging darts upon the enemy, till, overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by numbers, he was conſtrained to yield him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf their priſoner.</p>
            <p>But to return again to our fair heroine; urged on by deſpair, ſhe attempted to rid herſelf of a life, which, ſince Oſcar was ſlain, could no longer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford her pleaſure; But Claudius, the young Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had been entertained by the Druid, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately obſerved her, and made a ſign to his men, to ſurround and convey her priſoner to his tent; which was accordingly done, notwithſtanding her efforts to prevent it, by endeavouring to put an end to her exiſtence: but what was the exceſs of her joy, when in the tent, to which ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the Roman troops, ſhe beheld her belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Oſcar! He was reclined on a ſuperb ſopha, and from the wounds, which he had received in battle,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:035333_0134_1002304700CE92D0"/>
was extremely weak and faint; ſo that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſight of his miſtreſs a priſoner, and in the tent of his rival, raiſed in his breaſt ſuch violent emotions, that they were nearly fatal to him. Nor was Elſimena leſs agitated to behold her lover, contrary to her expectations, alive; yet a priſoner and apparently on the brink of the grave. She ſunk at his feet in a ſwoon, out of which it was ſome time before ſhe was recovered by the attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, who, by the orders of their maſter, treated her with the utmoſt reſpect and attention; but what afterwards contributed greatly to her recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery was, to find from the ſurgeon, who had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the wounds of her lover, that they were not mortal.</p>
            <p>Elſimena having, at the requeſt of Oſcar, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him by what means ſhe fell into the hands of the enemy, was in return acquainted by him, that ſhe was in the tent of the ſtranger, who had ſojourned with them in the Druid's cave; who, he had learned, was ſon to the Roman General; he alſo informed her, that it was entirely owing to the humanity of Claudius, he owed his life.
<q>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowered,</q>
ſaid he,
<q>by the enemy, I ſunk down covered with wounds, and faint with loſs of blood, when the generous Roman haſtily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to my aſſiſtance; his own ſoldiers bore me to this tent, where I have been treated with a reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, rather due to the victor than the vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus has he rendered me his debtor for a life, which muſt, in future, prove a burthen to me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:035333_0135_100230456D7CCA68"/>'Have better thoughts, my Oſcar,' ſaid Elſime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, ſuppoſing he alluded to the proſpect of a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous captivity;
<q>who can tell but the grateful Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may deſign the generous treatment we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as a prelude to the freedom he means to offer you.</q>
               <q>Indulge not that flattering thought, my Elſimena,</q>
ſaid the youth,
<q>which, ſhould it prove a true preſage, can afford to me but ſmall conſolation. Do not I ſee thee captive to my rival? to one, who is too powerfully awake to thy charms, to forego the poſſeſſion of them: O cruel thought! it wrings my very ſoul.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall paſs over the many tender melancholy things, which paſſed between the lovers on this ſubject, (which they could the more freely utter, as they found their attendants were not familiar with the Celtic tongue) as alſo the ſolemn proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations which Elſimena made, to preſerve the faith ſhe had plighted to Oſcar inviolate, whether life or death awaited her, and inform the reader, that the Romans having gained a complete victory over the Britons, Claudius returned to the tent where Elſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena and Oſcar were. He approached them both with the moſt obliging and reſpectful air, and addreſſing himſelf to Oſcar, though his eyes inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly inclined toward the fair captive—'Fortune,' ſaid he,
<q>is not always the friend to valour; if ſo, Oſcar would this day have been a conqueror; bluſh not, gallant youth; the Romans have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to boaſt of a conqueſt, which redounds equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the honour of the vanquiſhed and the victor; but here indeed,</q>
ſaid he, turning to Elſimena,
<q>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:035333_0136_1002303FDD638388"/>is a prize, that may well ſwell the pride of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt! Weep not, beautiful Elſimena,</q>
continued
<q>he, you are in the hands of one, who, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by your beauty, will not forget the reſpect due to your virtue and misfortunes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Little more paſſed at that time, Claudius being ſummoned to the tent of his father; who, having in the action been ſlightly wounded by a javelin, had ordered enquiry to be made among the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Briton, who threw it; and further to aid the diſcovery, had offered life and freedom to the owner. The next day the javelin was expoſed, in the tent of the Roman General, but as the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fought, for the moſt part, with darts and ſwords, few appeared to review it, much leſs to own it.</p>
            <p>News, however, was at length brought to the General, that one of the priſoners confeſſed himſelf to be the man, who threw it. The Roman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ordered him to be brought into his preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and having diſmiſſed his attendants, aſked him many queſtions concerning the manner in which he came by it. 'Sir,' ſaid Modred, (for it was in truth that venerable ſage)
<q>it once belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a fair unfortunate, who has long ſince deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to the duſt.</q>
The General, whoſe curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity was excited by this reply, requeſted, with emotion, to know further particulars; which the Druid thus proceeded to relate.
<q>When Aulus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</q>
ſaid he,
<q>ſucceeded the gallant Oſtorius, who gained immortal honour by the conqueſt of our monarch, the valiant Caractatus, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:035333_0137_1002303E4F77EA48"/>
of the Roman forces; Ethelda, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a gallant warrior, who has ſince fallen in defence of our liberties, was made captive by a young commander, who led a numerous legion againſt our nation. The conqueror, ſtruck with her beauty, and reſpecting her misfortunes, ſtrove to lighten her captivity by the moſt generous treatment; but, alas! in ſo doing, he impoſed on her more laſting chains. She no longer view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him but with the eyes of love, and a paſſion, too ſtrong to be eraſed by time, took poſſeſſion of her heart. The young conqueror, as I before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, was not inſenſible of her charms; but E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelda knew too well what was due to her birth and ſex to yield on diſhonourable terms; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the ſolicitation of her lover with a firmneſs that at once awed and increaſed his flame. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of her merit, he at length offered her his hand, which the fair captive had not power to refuſe. That very hour, ſhe became his wife; but a final ſeparation, in a ſhort time after, took place. On their march to join the Roman Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, they were ſurpriſed by a body of our troops; led on by the father of Ethelda, they routed the enemy and reſcued the priſoners, which were tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the former ſkirmiſh. Ethelda, from a riſing ground, beheld the conteſt with inconceivable horrour; not knowing for the ſucceſs of which to direct her prayers to Heaven; the liberties, and perhaps the lives, of her father and country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, depending on the one ſide, and, on the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thoſe of the man, for whom ſhe had enſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herſelf from both.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="unknown:035333_0138_1002303A717CB380"/>
               <q>The engagement was obſtinate and bloody, but victory was on the point of terminating in favour of our arms, when the Romans were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by a troop of horſe; but not before the unfortunate Ethelda had ſeen both her father and her huſband fall.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This reinforcement of the Romans threw the Britons into confuſion; they fled with precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſcaped the ſword of the enemy under covert of the night. Ethelda fled, not knowing whither, till her ſtrength failing, ſhe ſunk down at the door of a poor widow, who received her into the humble dwelling, and ſet before her ſome refreſhment; but it was two days before ſhe could be prevailed upon either to eat or ſpeak; after this, ſhe became more calm, and related to the good woman the calamities, that had befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len her and cauſed her grief; ſhe alſo declared it as her determination, never more to unite with ſociety, and joyfully accepted the poor widow's offer of abiding in her cottage, and partaking the ſmall comforts her humble lot afforded. Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da died two years after, having firſt given birth to a female infant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'I had often,' continued Modred,
<q>obſerved her at our Holy Sacrifices, where ſhe conſtantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared covered with a veil, which totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concealed her perſon from the eyes of men; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity prompted me to enquire into her ſtory, which I learned firſt from the woman, at whoſe houſe ſhe ſojourned, and afterwards from Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da herſelf; for it is neceſſary, Sir, to inform you,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:035333_0139_100230374E30CC18"/>
that although animated by the glorious cauſe of liberty, I for once ventured to raiſe the hoſtile ſword in defence of my country, my office is to ſpeak comfort to the afflicted, to utter divine myſteries, and to recommend univerſal peace and concord to mankind; being, to be plain, of the ſacred order of Druids.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My office gave me free acceſs to Ethelda, who readily made me the confident of her misfortunes, and with her laſt breath, recommended her infant daughter to my protection. On her death, I took the little liſper home to my abode; and when the fury of war forced me to ſeek ſhelter in theſe mountains, ſhe was the companion of my flight, and for eighteen years has been the ſolace of my declining age; but, alas! my Elſimena is either numbered among the dead, or muſt waſte her blooming years in an irkſome captivity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Roman commander aſked, with an emotion that cauſed Modred to ſuſpect he was prompted by other motives, than mere curioſity, in his enquiries, what were his reaſons for ſuppoſing, that the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ethelda was either numbered among the dead, or a captive. The ſage then informed him of all that he knew concerning Elſimena; how, on being told her lover had fallen in the battle, ſhe ruſhed, ſword in hand, into the midſt of the enemy; how, by the intrepidity of her conduct, the flying troops were inſpired with courage once more to face the enemy, and to revenge the death of their brave companions; and laſtly, that it had been rumoured ſhe was a priſoner in the tent of Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:035333_0140_100230342C0A8940"/>
the General's ſon. Then reverting to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of his diſcourſe, 'That javelin, my lord,' ſaid he,
<q>with which it was my fortune to wound you, the wretched mother of Elſimena, previous to the fatal engagement, which bereft her of all ſhe held dear, concealed in her garments, for the purpoſe of putting an end to her exiſtence, ſhould ſhe live to ſee either her parent or huſband ſlain. But that Almighty Power, who permitted her affliction, endued her with fortitude to bear it. The weapon once belonged to her huſband, and in her exile ſhe preſerved it as a precious relic ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred to his remembrance. On her death, it fell into my hand; ſince which, for the ſame reaſon, I have kept it as belonging to one, in whoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes I was deeply intereſted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Yeſterday,' continued Modred,
<q>inſtigated by an impulſe, for which I cannot account, I armed myſelf with it; and, when inſpired by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of my brave countrymen, I aſcended the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like chariot, reſolving to yield up my life in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our liberties, having expended my darts, as a laſt effort, I threw the javelin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Wonderful and myſterious,' ſaid the Roman,
<q>are the ways of Providence! in me, venerable Modred, behold the father of Elſimena, and once the huſband of the unfortunate Ethelda!</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Myſterious Heaven!' ſaid the Druid,
<q>can it really be ſo?</q>
            </p>
            <p>'I fell, indeed,' ſaid the General,
<q>among the ſlain, but was not mortally wounded; the brave fellows, who fought by my ſide, bore me from
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:035333_0141_10023031232C0358"/>
the field of battle, and a ſhort time reſtored me to my former vigour; but my blooming bride was forever loſt. I cauſed ſtrict ſearch to be made after her, but all was in vain; ſince, till this day, I could never obtain the leaſt tidings of her. The javelin, with which I was yeſterday wounded, I remembered once to have been mine, it having, for ſeveral ages, been handed down in our family from father to ſon, as a relic of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. I recollected the period when I loſt it, and thought it might have been thrown by a Briton, who had fought in that engagement, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeparated me from Ethelda; methought it might lead to a diſcovery of her, or at leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me concerning the manner of her death. This, venerable Modred, was the cauſe of my enquiry, and Heaven doubtleſs inſpired me with the thought, that it might reſtore to me the pledge of my Ethelda's love.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While this diſcourſe paſſed between the Roman commander and the venerable Druid, a ſcene near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as intereſting was acting in the tent of Claudius. The grateful youth, having diſcovered to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the generous Britons, to whom he was indebted for his life and liberty, were among the priſoners, received his permiſſion to offer them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuitable to the ſignal ſervice they had done him.</p>
            <p>'Generous Oſcar,' ſaid Claudius, 'it is time to convince you, that ingratitude does not form a part of the Roman character; abide with us, gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant youth, enrol yourſelf among the friends of
<q>
                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:035333_0142_1002302D091103B0"/>Rome, and in return they will beſtow on you the higheſt honours; you are ſilent, Oſcar; but your countenance tells me, you treat our proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friendſhip with diſdain. Well then, ſince it is ſo, Claudius alone muſt pay the debt he owes; from this moment, gallant youth, you are free, and bluſh not to receive life and freedom from one, who to your generoſity is indebted for the power of beſtowing either. Oſcar, you are ſilent; I would do much to purchaſe your eſteem, your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ſix Britiſh priſoners, whom you ſhall name, will I alſo add: ſtill are you ſilent!</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Claudius,' ſaid the youth,
<q>a Briton's heart muſt ſpeak in his countenance; for the lives and liberties of his friends, Oſcar offers you the return of a grateful heart; but, for his own, Claudius, can he offer thanks for life and freedom, when robbed of all that can render either deſirable?</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Oſcar,' ſaid the young Roman,
<q>I underſtand you; this fair maid is the object, to which we both aſpire; we both love Elſimena, and the happineſs of one (ſo ſay our paſſions) <hi>muſt</hi> be founded on the deſpair of the other. Muſt it then be ſo, Oſcar? No; you ſhall ſee that a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can ſoar above the low purſuits of ſelf-grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, that his pride and confidence reſts not alone in the ſtrength of his arms, nor in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of cities, but in the ſubjection of his paſſions. You poſſeſs the heart of Elſimena; fortune has given me a right over her perſon, but it is a right which I ſcorn to avail myſelf of. Take her, gallant youth, receive the fair Elſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mena, even
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:035333_0143_1001FE2D094DF928"/>
from the hand of thy rival, and henceforth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Romans fight, not to tyrannize over and enſlave, but to civilize mankind.</q>
Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he took the hand of Elſimena, and united it with that of her beloved Oſcar.</p>
            <p>The joy of both was, for ſome minutes, abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in admiration; that Claudius, in the ardour of youth, when the affections are unuſed to yield to the curb of reaſon, in the height of proſperity, which is ſo ſeldom tempered by moderation, ſhould thus nobly ſquare his conduct by the moſt rigid rules of virtue; thus nobly yield up the object of his love into the arms of another, ſtruck them with an awe, which, for ſome moments, deprived them of utterance. They threw themſelves at the feet of Claudius, who having once made the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſacrifice, experienced from it a ſatisfaction, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſurpaſſing that which any ſenſual gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could have beſtowed.</p>
            <p>Affairs were in this poſture, when a meſſage ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the General, requeſting the attendance of his ſon, and the two priſoners, who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in his tent. For, upon enquiry, he had learned that they were really Elſimena and Oſcar.</p>
            <p>Claudius, who ſuppoſed his father's ſummons to proceed merely from a curioſity to ſee and honour thoſe, to whom he was indebted for the life and liberty of his ſon, immediately proceeded with them to his tent. When they entered, they were inexpreſſibly delighted to find the venerable Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id; who, in his turn, received no leſs joy at be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the young pair. He preſented Elſimena
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:035333_0144_100230292A5A3D48"/>
to the Roman commander, who embraced her with a warmth truly parental, and with delight ſcarcely to be equalled, viewed the beauties of her form, promiſing a mind equally noble and perfect.</p>
            <p>Claudius and the young Britons, as the reader will conclude, were at a loſs to comprehend the cauſe of this ſeemingly myſterious behaviour, till they were informed of it by Modred; who, at the requeſt of the General, related to them the partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulars of Ethelda's ſtory. Elſimena then threw herſelf at the feet of her ſire, to teſtify her entire obedience to his will. The paſſion, which Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us lately entertained for her perſon, was now chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into brotherly love; he embraced her with the tendereſt and pureſt affection, and rejoiced ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in having gained ſo charming a ſiſter. Joy was diffuſed over every countenance, excepting that of Oſcar, who greatly feared Elſimena was once more on the point of being ſnatched from his arms; but his fears vaniſhed, when, at the requeſt of his ſon, the Roman commander joined his hand with that of his miſtreſs.</p>
            <p>Such was the joy, which pervaded the breaſt of the noble Roman, on receiving to his arms ſo lovely an image of his loſt Ethelda, and ſuch was his gratitude to the venerable Druid, who had for ſo many years cheriſhed and protected her, and, to whom he was beſide indebted for the life of his ſon, that he promiſed to grant him whatever he ſhould aſk in favour of his countrymen. Modred availed himſelf of this generous offer, by requeſting the lives and liberties of all, who had, the day before,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:035333_0145_100230246C6C7B78"/>
been made priſoners; which was accordingly granted.</p>
            <p>Through the influence of the Druid, Elſimena and Claudius, an honourable and advantageous peace was ſoon concluded between the Romans and the warlike Britons, who inhabited that part of the country.</p>
            <p>The eyes of the venerable Druid were, in a good old age, cloſed by his beloved Elſimena; who, with Oſcar, lived a ſeries of years in uninterrupted peace and happineſs.</p>

            <p>SIR Reginald de Cuthbert, a noble knight who had long fought valiantly under the banners of the Holy Croſs, when the armies were going to retire to their reſpective quarters for the winter, applied to the general for leave to return home. Crowned with glory, and arrayed with honour, Sir Reginald ſought retirement in the land of his fathers; intending to dedicate the remainder of his days to the ſervice of his God, in defence of whoſe name he had ſo often engaged in the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of battle.</p>
            <p>The many perilous adventures the knight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered on his way from the Holy Land, we find not recorded in hiſtory, until his arrival at the borders of a dreary foreſt on the confines of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. The twilight was ſpreading over the hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſphere, when Sir Reginald entered what at firſt
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:035333_0167_10022FE198C06148"/>
appeared to him a ſmall wood, which he now found extended itſelf by degrees into an immenſe and almoſt impenetrable foreſt. The knight prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forward with great impatience, till the ſhades of night, which fell heavily over the foreſt, in ſome meaſure arreſted his progreſs; the narrow winding path grew more and more intricate; the clouds, which ſeemed charged with thunder, paſſed ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly along the heavens; the wind now aroſe and whiſtled hollow through the branches, the rain began to rattle amidſt the trees, and a tremendous ſtorm ſeemed to be faſt approaching, while the darkneſs of night ſurrounded him with all its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>At length, overcome with fatigue and impeded by the buſhes and underwood, the knight alighted from his horſe, and threw himſelf upon the ground; but ſoon aroſe, and ſecuring his truſty ſteed, walked ſlowly onward in hopes of finding ſome ſolitary cottage, which might afford him ſhelter from the 'pelting of the pitileſs ſtorm.' Ere the knight had meaſured many paces, he perceived a light, which, from its lofty ſituation, at firſt appeared to his deluded eye a brilliant ſtar; he was, however, ſoon undeceived, and joy reani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated his drooping ſpirits, in a few moments he found himſelf at the gate of a caſtle. The knight knocked violently at the caſtle gate.
<q>Who is there?</q>
ſome body; whom he could not ſee, ſnarl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a rough voice from above.
<q>In the name of all the bleſſed ſaints,</q>
exclaimed Sir Reginald,
<q>I conjure you to open quickly the gate to a trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eller,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:035333_0168_10022FDDB0906750"/>
who haſt loſt his way in the foreſt, and is piteouſly beaten by the tempeſt.</q>
No anſwer was returned, but the gate was opened by an unſeen hand. The entrance was ſtill and gloomy as the grave. The knight groped his way through the dark. 'Come!' roared the ſame rough voice he had heard before; at the ſame time, a hand, cold as ice, pulled him along. Sir Reginald ſhuddered violently, and was going to retire, when the gate was ſhut after him with a thundering noiſe.</p>
            <p>Perceiving that all retreat was cut off, he bade defiance to his fate, and reſolved to meet the worſt as a man. After advancing a few paces, the icy hand was drawn back. The knight ſtopped to wait till it ſhould again lay hold of him, and lead him farther; but waited in vain; he groped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, expecting to find his guide, whom he fancied to be near, but he was gone. Not a footſtep or the moſt diſtant ſound was heard through the whole building. Not a ſingle ray of light broke through the diſmal darkneſs, which ſurrounded him, yet he proceeded with extended arms and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced about thirty ſteps, when ſomething im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded his paſſage, he endeavoured to examine it with his hand, but it ſeemed ſuddenly to ſtart back; he once more ſtretched out his hand, and felt a heap of ſkulls and bones. Horror and a chilly tremor ſhook his whole frame. The awful ſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſurrounded him, was ſtill uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
            <p>The knight was fixed to the ground, wildly ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the impenetrable darkneſs. At length
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:035333_0169_10022FD6CEC9FAF0"/>
a hollow broken ſound was heard, which ſeemed at a great diſtance. After a long pauſe, it vibrated in his ear a ſecond time. The idea that he had nothing more to loſe, and that every means of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting an eſcape from that reſidence of horror was cut off, entirely ſubdued his fear, and prompted him to follow that ſound. A few paces brought him to a ſtone ſtaircaſe. Having deſcended five ſteps, a doleful groan ſeemed to proceed from a room not far diſtant. The knight advanced ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with the utmoſt circumſpection, muſing on his perilous ſituation, when at once he felt the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage obſtructed by a door, which opened without difficulty. The room to which it led was alſo a reſidence of darkneſs and diſmal ſilence. The knight was reſolved to enter it boldly. Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately he examined the entrance with his foot, before he proceeded, and found with unſpeakable horror, that it was bottomleſs. The hollow diſmal ſound again ſtruck his ear from a ſmall diſtance. He ſhuddered violently, and ſtaggered onward. Every thing was now lonely and ſilent all around; at length he came to a ſecond ſtaircaſe, aſcended ſeven ſteps, and then deſcended as many, when his eyes ſuddenly beheld a faint glimmer of light, which ſeemed to emerge from below, at a great diſtance. Coming nearer, the knight obſerved that he was ſtanding on the brink of a deep abyſs, from which the glimmer broke forth. An old half rotten ſtaircaſe led down; he however reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to riſk every thing, and pulling off his ſhoes to avoid making a noiſe, began to deſcend. When
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:035333_0170_1001FE1F34259048"/>
he came to the eighth ſtep, the hollow ſound was again repeated: the knight ſtopped a moment, and then went on with returning courage. When he had reached the middle, the light ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared, and impenetrable darkneſs ſurrounded him once more. He ſtopped to conſider what could be done, when a ſtone got looſe beneath his feet, and rolled down with a thundering noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the door of the vault.
<q>Who diſturbs my reſt?</q>
the hollow, well known voice exclaimed. Sir Reginald was rivetted to the ground in dread expectation; terror ſealed his lips. The door of the vault opened ſlowly, and a pale white figure appeared, with a candle in one hand. It advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two ſteps, lifted up one hand in a menacing manner, and diſappeared. The ſight of this dreadful apparition almoſt petrified him on the ſpot, his ſenſes ſeemed to forſake him, and the blood congealed within his veins.</p>
            <p>The knight having recovered a little the uſe of his ſenſes, with difficulty regained the top of the ſteps, and from thence perceived a paſſage quite different from the other, and following it he arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the foot of a ſpiral ſtaircaſe. He aſcended many ſteps, at length a partition impeded him, he puſhed forcibly againſt it with his right hand, and ſhivered a glaſs pane into a thouſand pieces. 'Who is there?' a rough voice exclaimed. At the ſame time a door opened, and a moſt alarming diſcourſe filled the knight with diſmal apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. 'Have you ſharpened the knife?' one of the talkers aſked. 'Yes, it is bright and ſharp,'
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:035333_0171_10022FD091A8C468"/>
replied another voice,
<q>his blood ſhall flow abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly.</q>
With theſe words the door burſt open. Horror and deſpair now winged Sir Reginald's ſteps. He flew down the ſtaircaſe, and had ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reached the bottom, when he was ſuddenly ſeized by the ice-cold hand, which he had felt on his entrance in that abode of terror. Here the knight's ſenſes fled, and he dropped down in a ſwoon.</p>
            <p>When Sir Reginald opened his eyes, he found himſelf in a ſplendid room, lying at his eaſe on a ſuperb bed, and a girl with two ſervants ſitting by the bed-ſide, chaffing his temples. 'Where am I?' were the firſt ſounds he uttered. They aſſured him, he was in good hands; on enquiring to whom the caſtle belonged, he was informed it was the property of the Lady Counteſs of Darbis, who would ſee him in the morning. An excellent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per was ſoon after placed on the table, and the ſervants retired after he had finiſhed his meal.</p>
            <p>When left to himſelf, the knight began to muſe on the adventures of that eventful and alarming evening. A thouſand ideas crouded upon his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and no clue could be found to extricate himſelf from the mazes of wonder and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in which he was loſt, the fearful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of whoſe power he was in, and what would become of him, lay heavy on his heart; impatient to have the myſtery of his ſituation unfolded, and yet dreaded that period. Hope and fear crouded alternately upon his ſoul, until at length he fell aſleep, overcome by fatigue of body and mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="unknown:035333_0172_10022FCC772BE2D8"/>Sir Reginald awoke at ten o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and after breakfaſt, was conducted by a page through three magnificent apartments; in the fourth, the lady of the caſtle, dreſſed in black, with a veil of the ſame colour, was ſeated on a ſofa. She roſe on his entering the room, and court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied very civilly, then retook her ſeat. After a long pauſe, the knight ſaid ſomething in a faulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accent, which was meant as an excuſe for his intruding viſit. The lady kindly bade him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to her caſtle, and moreover deſired him to be ſeated. This kindneſs diſpelled all perplexity, and gave him new courage; he related his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the preceding evening, at which the lady of the caſtle ſmiled often, and promiſed the knight, that the whole myſterious adventure ſhould be elucidated. After dinner, the ſervants were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the room, and Sir Reginald found every ſtrange event, that had filled him with ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, ſo natural, that he even bluſhed at his childiſh fears. The ice-cold hand—the ſkulls and bones —the ſpectre, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were found to be the neceſſary appendages to every caſtle. The cold hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the phlegmatic porter. He drew his hand ſuddenly back, becauſe the knight trembled violently and ſtruggled to diſengage himſelf, and was obliged to return and light the torch, which the wind had extinguiſhed. Sir Reginald, with ſtaggering ſteps, had reached a remote part of the caſtle, where the Counteſs had erected a kind of Mauſoleum to her deceaſed huſband; and his hand had touched the ſkulls and bones it was dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orated
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:035333_0173_10022FCA250F3A78"/>
with. The groans and ſighs, which he heard, came from an old domeſtic, who had a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent tooth-ache. When the ſtone rolled down, ſhe went out of the cellar, where ſhe was ſuffered to lie, to ſee who was there; ſhe threatened him with her hand, and went back, becauſe ſhe miſtook him for one of the ſervants, and fancied the ſtone had been thrown down on purpoſe to frighten her. The door, which led to the bottomleſs room, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an old cellar, where the ſteps had been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ravages of time, and which the ſervants had left open by careleſſneſs. The room on the ſpiral ſtaircaſe, where the knight had broken the glaſs pane, was inhabited by the cook and butler. Their diſcourſe, part of which he overheard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned a hog, which was to be killed the next day. When he was hurrying down the ſtaircaſe, the porter received him in his arms, to prevent his falling, and carried him, during his ſwoon, to the apartment, where he recovered the uſe of his ſenſes.</p>
            <p>Sir Reginald was aſhamed that this accidental concurrence of circumſtances could have rendered him ſo ridiculouſly fearful and cowardly.
<q>This adventure,</q>
ſaid the knight to himſelf,
<q>ſhall teach me to bridle my impetuous imagination, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine every thing uncommon by the torch of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thus to guard my underſtanding againſt the dangerous deluſions of a lively impetuous fancy.</q>
