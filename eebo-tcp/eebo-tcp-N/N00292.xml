            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> of Men and Women (be they elder or younger persons) together: Now this we affirm to be utterly unlawful, and that it cannot be tollerated in such a place as <hi>New-England,</hi> without great Sin. And that it may appear, that we are not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Affection</hi> without Judgment, let the following Arguments be weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Arg. 1. <hi>That which the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns is sinful.</hi> None but Atheists will deny this <hi>Proposition:</hi> But the Scripture condemns <hi>Promiscuous Dancing.</hi> This <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption</hi> is proved, 1. <hi>From the Seventh Commandment.</hi> It is an Eternal Truth to be observed in expounding the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that whenever any sin is forbidden, not only the highest acts of that sin, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all degrees thereof, and all occasions lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto are prohibited. Now we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find one Orthodox and Judicious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, that writeth on the Commandments, but mentions <hi>Promiscuous Dancing,</hi> as a breach of the seventh Commandment, as 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000370_0003_0FA558C3350643B8"/>
being an occasion, and an incentive to that which is evil in the sight of God. Yea, this is so manifest as that the <hi>Assembly</hi> in the <hi>larger Catechism,</hi> do expresly take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Dancings,</hi> as a violation of the Commandments. It is sad, that when in times of Reformation, Children have been taught in their Cotechism, that such <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> is against the Commandment of God, that now in <hi>New-England</hi> they should pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically be learned the contrary. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast Touches and Gesticulations used by <hi>Dancers,</hi> have a palpable tendency to that which is evil. Whereas some object, that they are not sensible of any ill motions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned in them, by being Spectators or Actors in such <hi>Saltations;</hi> we are not bound to believe all which some pretend concerning their own Mortification. But suppose it were so, if there be other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who are by <hi>Mixt Dancing</hi> drawn into sin; that's enough against it. And that many are so, <hi>Juvenal's</hi> Verses are a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proof</p>

The word translated <hi>Revelling,</hi> may be read <hi>Dancing.</hi> It is the same with that in the <hi>Romans,</hi> which our translation calls <hi>Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The learned <hi>Aretius</hi> comments thus upon it; <hi>By</hi> K<gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>he intends wanton Dancing, and so it is fitly mentioned after that of</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in Wine, <hi>because it was customary with the Gentiles, after they had been drinking to Excess, to fall to dancing and singing; and commonly their Songs were profane and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene.</hi> Thus he, And indeed, as <hi>Ravanellus</hi> and <hi>Voetius</hi> have well observed: the Greek word K<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (which our Translators call <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oting,</hi> and in <hi>Peter, Revelling</hi>) is by the most learned in the Greek Tongue, judged to intend <hi>Dancing.</hi> Thus <hi>Hesychius</hi> saith, that it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> And it is evident, that <hi>Pindar,</hi> the Greek Poet, doth so use the word. He saith, <gap reason="foreign">

Interpreters; the Scripture does expresly, and by name condemn <hi>Dancing</hi> as a vicious practice. The argument stands thus, K<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> are expresly condemned in the Scripture? But mixt <hi>Dancings</hi> are K<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Therefore they are expresly condemned in the Scripture. <hi>A</hi>lso under that of <hi>Chambring, Wantoness, las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civousness</hi> Dancings are implied.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There are many other Scriptures which do implicitly condemn them as sinful.</hi> How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten does the Scripture commend unto Christians, <hi>Gravity</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> in their behaviour at all times; and condemn all <hi>Levity</hi> in Carriage. When as <hi>Dancing</hi> is (as some have expressed it) a <hi>Regular Madness.</hi> That wise Prince <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> after he had seen such things, the question being asked, What is the difference between a <hi>Dancer</hi> and a <hi>Mad-man?</hi> Replied; <hi>There was no other difference, but only this; that the person who is really</hi> Phrentick, <hi>is mad all the day long; when as the Dancer is only mad an hour in a day perhaps. Lud. Vives</hi> tells a pleasant story of certain men, who coming out of <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> when they saw the <hi>Spaniards</hi> dance, they were so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, as to run away, supposing them 
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000370_0007_0FA558CBA75F9700"/>
to be possessed with some Spirit, or mad at least. And truly such affected Levity, and Antick Behaviour, when persons skip and fling about like <hi>Bedlams,</hi> a<hi>s</hi> they say, <hi>Dancers</hi> are wont to do; is no way beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Gravity of a Christian. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Scripture saith, <hi>Whatsoever things are of good report,</hi> think of these, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 8. which implieth, that Christians ought to avoid things of evil report. But <hi>Promiscuous Dancings</hi> are so; &amp; that not only amongst serious Christians, but even amongst the Gentiles. Their grave and wise men have branded that custom as vile, infamous, and abominable; whose words we shall hear anon. But therefore that Rule which saith, meddle not with things of bad report, forbids Christians to have any concernment with <hi>Promiscuous Dancings.</hi> Yet again the Scripture saith, <hi>Give no offence, neither to the Jew, nor to the Gentile, nor to the Church of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 32. In indifferent things this precept takes place; but the implead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dancing</hi> is very offensive upon more accounts than one, as will afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:000370_0008_0FA558CCB485D4D0"/>Arg. 2. <hi>If we consider, by whom this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Promiscuous Dancing was first invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by whom patronized, and by whom witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against, we may well conclude, that the admitting of it, in such a place as</hi> New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, <hi>will be a thing pleasing to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but highly provoking to the Holy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We design to write as comprehensively as we can; and have therefore in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument put several things together, the particulars whereof we shall endeavour to clear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Who were the Inventors of Petulant Dancings?</hi> They had not their original a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the People of God, but amongst the Heathen.

saith, <hi>Learn not the way of the Heathen.</hi> Jer. 10. 2. And that the Lords People may <hi>not do after their manners,</hi> nor imitate their Heathenish Customes, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20. 23.

            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> practice in use, only amongst the Heathen, but never known among the people of God, except in times of degeneracy, ought not to be taken up. But this is true of that practice, which we now testify against.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By whom have Promiscuous Dances been patronized?</hi> Truly, by the worst of the Heathen. <hi>Caligula, Nero,</hi> and such like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists and Epicures were delighted in them. <hi>Lucius</hi> (that infamous Apostate) hath written an Oration, in defence of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and Promiscuous Dancing<hi>s.</hi> Amongst the Papists, some of their more gtave Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, decry such a practice as a great Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. <hi>Alexander Fabritius,</hi> a <hi>L</hi>earned Man, though Popishly affected, was indeed clearly convinced of the great sin which is therein.

notice of them; he thus expresseth himself. <hi>The entring into the Processions of Dances, binders men from ingress into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Procession; and those who Dance, offend against the Sacraments of the Church. First, against Baptism; They break the Covenant which they made with God in Baptism; wherein they promised, to renounce the Devil and his Pomps; but when they enter into the Dance, they go in the Pompous Procession of the Devil.</hi> Thus that Author: But gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, Popish Casuists justify it, as they do many other moral evils; so <hi>Cajetan Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Silvester,</hi> and other Papists: The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Schoolmen makes a light matter of it, calling it a <hi>Venial Sin:</hi> And therefore <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vater</hi> does justly upbraid the Popish Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in that their Writers do generally main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the lawfulness of P<hi>romiscuous</hi> D<hi>ancings.</hi> So that the Patrons of this Practice are men not <hi>sound in the Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Who are they that have faithfully te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified against this practice?</hi> Ignorant and Profane Men-say, no body i<hi>s</hi> against it, but a few silly Precisian<hi>s,</hi> who are more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise than wise. But we certainly know, 
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000370_0012_0FA558CF61FD10A8"/>
that the wisest, and the learnedest, and the holiest men in the world have disliked it. <hi>The Antient Doctors,</hi> (Father<hi>s</hi> a<hi>s</hi> they are called) have thundred against this Sin. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> in hi<hi>s</hi> Sermons on <hi>Genesis,</hi> treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on <hi>Jacob's</hi> Marriage; <hi>Here</hi> (saith he) <hi>We read of a Wedding, but not a word of Dancing there.</hi> Yea, he sticks not to call D<hi>ancing</hi> a D<hi>iabolical Practice.</hi> And in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of hi<hi>s</hi> Sermon<hi>s;</hi> He saith, that <hi>Wherever there is a Petulant</hi> D<hi>ance, the</hi> D<hi>evil is one of the Company. A</hi>nd <hi>Arnobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> does vehemently reprehend the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, because of their lascivious Dance<hi>s. Austin</hi> doth severely tax this vice. <hi>Ambrose</hi> doth advise all Godly Parent<hi>s,</hi> that would not have the Souls of their Children cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and ruined, not to send them to the Dancing-School. <hi>A</hi>nd how often do the Father<hi>s</hi> call the D<hi>ance</hi> a <hi>Work of Satan, one of his Pomps and Vanities, which all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized persons are bound to renounce? A</hi>nd not only Fathers, but whole <hi>Councils</hi> have born witness against them. So did the <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Synod at <hi>Constantinople. A</hi>lso the Synod which met at <hi>Laodicea,</hi> and 
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000370_0013_0FA558D62FEF7430"/>
several others, absolutely prohibit all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous Dancings, not allowing them so much, as at Weddings. Thus it was with Christians, before the World did degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate again into Paganish, Heathenish Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms. We have now heard the ordinance of Antiquity discharged against the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded Dancers. <hi>A</hi> Shower of Arrow<hi>s</hi> are yet behind.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>the great Reformers of Religion, and Opposers of</hi> A<hi>ntichristianism,</hi> none have gone beyond them, in an Holy Zeal against Profane and Promiscuous Dancing. Let us in the first place, cite the <hi>Waldenses:</hi> They are in the Scripture, honoured with the name of <hi>Saints,</hi> Rev. 13. 7. These <hi>Saints of God,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs of Jesus,</hi> were haters of Mixt Dance<hi>s.</hi> Because their words are Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical; we shall here transcribe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert them, a<hi>s</hi> we find them mentioned by <hi>Perrin,</hi> in his History of the Doctrine and Discipline of the <hi>Waldenses,</hi> p. 63. They thus testify: A D<hi>ance is the</hi> D<hi>evils Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He that enters into a</hi> D<hi>ance, enters into his Possession. The</hi> D<hi>evil is the Guide, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and the end of the</hi> D<hi>ance</hi> A <hi>man sinneth in</hi>

D<hi>ancing divers wayes; as in his Pace, for all his steps are numbred; in his Touch, in his Ornaments, in his Hearing, sight, Speech, and other Vanities. We will prove first from Scripture, and then by other Reasons, how wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thing it is to</hi> D<hi>ance.—He that Danceth, maintaineth the Devil's Pomp, and singeth his Mass. Again, In a Dance, a man breaks the Ten Commandments of God. The very motion of the Body, which is used in Dancing, giveth Testimony enough of evil. A</hi>ustin <hi>saith, The miserable Dancer knoweth not, that as many Paces, as he makes in Dancing, so many steps he makes to Hell.</hi> Thus (and much more to this purpose) do those faithful Witnesses of Christ, declare against this Profane Practice.

The Judicious <hi>River</hi> saith, that such Dancing<hi>s</hi> as teach wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<hi>s</hi> in look<hi>s,</hi> or pride in behaviour, as he thinks almost all the <hi>Saltations</hi> do, which are now adayes Artificially learned in the <hi>Dancing-Schools,</hi> are breaches of the seventh Commandment, and ought not to be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in any Christian Common-wealth.

            <p>Arg. 3. <hi>That Practice which the Graver sort of Heathen have condemned as unlawful, Christians may well look upon as Sinful,</hi> Rom. 2. 14, 15. <hi>But this is true concerning mixed Dancing;</hi> as shall by Testimony be made to appear.</p>

He therefore speaks of it a<hi>s</hi> a great degeneracy of that Age, that some being Person<hi>s</hi> of Quality, sent their Children to a Dancing-school, and that he had himself seen at one of their Schools, a Boy of twelve years old Dancing, which he thought was a fitter employment for a lewd and foolish serving-boy, than for the Son of a Gentleman.

            <p>Now then, shall the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had only the dark Light of Nature to shew them what things are good &amp; what evil; condemn <hi>Petulant dancings?</hi> And shall Christians who have the Scriptures and the Glorious Light of the Gospel to illuminate them, practise or plead for such work<hi>s</hi> of Darkness?

            <p>Arg. 4. <hi>The practice which is not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Prayer, but is an Enemy to Religious Exercises, is surely an evil Practice. But this is true concerning mixt dancing.</hi> It i<hi>s</hi> a good Rule which <hi>Practical and Casuistical</hi> Divines are wont to give, <hi>That work which a Man cannot pray over, let him not meddle with.</hi> A Christian should do nothing wherein he cannot exercise Grace, or put a respect of Obedience to God on what he does. This in lawful Recreations may be done. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31 But who can seriously pray to the Holy God to be with him when he is going to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous <hi>dance?</hi> It is that which hinder<hi>s</hi> Religiou<hi>s</hi> Exercise<hi>s,</hi> especially for persons to go immediately from hearing a Sermon to a <hi>Gunecandrical Dance.</hi> It i<hi>s</hi> an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of profanenes<hi>s,</hi> an impudent contempt put upon the Gospel. The Devil thereby catcheth away the good seed of the Word, and the former Religiou<hi>s</hi> Exercise i<hi>s</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ineffectual. Some that write against 
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000370_0020_0FA558DFE85A94E8"/>
               <hi>dances,</hi> observe, that many young persons who seemed to be hopeful, and to have some good beginnings of Piety in them, by falling into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with that unlawful Recreation, have in a little time utterly left all savour of good; it being just with God, when they have forsaken him to follow the Devils Pomps and Vanities, to withdraw his Holy Spirit from them, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially give them up to mind nothing else but Folly. The Lord grant that none amongst our selves may find the observation true.</p>
            <p>Arg. 5. <hi>For Persons to Dance at a Time when God calls them to mourn, is certainly unlawful. But such is the case at this Day.</hi> If the thing were in at self lawful (which the Arguments insisted on prove that it is not) yet to set upon such a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice at such a time, must needs be a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation to the sight of God. <hi>Dancers</hi> are wont to alledge that Scripture, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>There is a Time to Dance,</hi> (though that does not speak a syllable for the Justification of such <hi>Dancing</hi> as we are writing against, nor indeed for any other <hi>Dancing,</hi> since the meaning of the place is not that there is a <hi>lawful time,</hi> but only a <hi>limited time</hi> to <hi>Dance.</hi>) But they should consider that <hi>There is a Time to mourn.</hi> Now to set up <hi>Dances</hi> at a Time when Gods calls to mourn, is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a provocation.

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Those Instances are not at all to the purpose; for they were Religious <hi>Dances</hi> accommodated to the State of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Church. They had also Musick in the<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> worship, but such as have so in these dayes J<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>daize</hi> more than <hi>Christians</hi> ought to do, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> should divert into another <hi>Question,</hi> should <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> speak to that.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:000370_0024_0FA558E2FA137650"/>2. Neither were those mentioned, <hi>Mixed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings:</hi> It is said of <hi>Miriam, The Woman went out after her with Dances, Exod.</hi> 15. 20. But not that Men went out with them: Nor did <hi>David</hi> take a Woman by the hand to <hi>Dance</hi> with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ark. In one Word, there is not so much as one Example in the whole Book of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>mixt dancing,</hi> except it be the Instance of that accursed and damned Harlot the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Herodias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Plea. 2. <hi>The Design of Dancing is only to teach Children good Behaviour and decent Carriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Religion is no Enemy to good Manners, to learn a due Poyse and Composure of Body is not unlawful, provided it be done without a provocation to Uncleanness, and be not a Nurse of Pride and Vanity. If therefore any be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have their Children instructed in that which may be truely Ornamental, or a desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Accomplishment in these respects, they may send them not to a Blasphemer, but to some Grave Person that will teach them Decency of Behaviour, not <hi>Promiscuously,</hi> but each Sex by themselves; so neither God nor Man will be offended.</p>
            <p>This notwithstanding, Every thing is not <hi>Good Carriage;</hi> which Light and Vain Persons shall call so. Why should <hi>Pantomimical Gestures</hi> be named good Carriage. There is a behaviour
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000370_0025_0FA558E370333008"/>
which Light Persons look upon as an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment; but such as are grave and solid, and wise (whose esteem is most to be valued) have other thoughts of it. If the Holy Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> were alive in these dayes, he would not call a <hi>stretched forth neck, and wanton eye, a Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing as they go,</hi> by the name of good carriage. It is one of the Devil's Wiles to Guild over corrupt Practices with Golden Names, that men may the more easily swallow them. In this debauched Age; frequent <hi>Osculations</hi> amongst those that are not in any Conjugal Relation, is called good Breeding, Gentile behaviour, and the like. But Christians ought to hate such tendencies to <hi>Nicolaitism,</hi> for Christ hates them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p>Plea 3. <hi>Children are much pleased with this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</hi> Ans. That we believe: But if it suit with their corrupt natures, that's a sign it is evil. No doubt but that if a Stage play were set up, many Children would be as much pleased with it, as now they are with the Dance. If a Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer shall tell them, There's as good Divinity to be learned by a Play as by the Scripture it self, perhaps they may be debauched into the belief of it, if ever they should see Scripture-sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries acted in a Play, which indeed is a profane Practice common amongst the Papists, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in Reformed Churches under pain of the highest censure. The Lord saith, <hi>Seek not after your own heart and your own wayes,</hi> after 
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000370_0026_0FA558E6DD522A20"/>
which you use to go an whoring, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 35.</p>
            <p>Plea. 4. <hi>Such dancing is now become customary amongst Christians. Ans.</hi> Which cannot be thought on without horror. A great and Learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine takes notice of it as a very sad thing, that all the profane Dances in use amongst the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious Greeks of Old, have of late years been revived in the Christian World; yea, and in Places where the Reformed Religion has taught men better. But shall Christians follow the course of the World? They ought to swim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the stream, and to keep themselves pure from the sins of the Times of which this of <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dancing</hi> is none of the least.</p>
            <p>Plea. 5. <hi>Some good men think it is lawful! Ans.</hi> We are not to walk by the Opinion of this or that good Man, but by the Scriptures. <hi>To the Law and to the Testimony, if they speak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that there is no light in them.</hi> Fearful Judgments have befallen a Professing People for doing such things as some good Men through error of Judgment have approved of. We dare not deny, that there have been some good Men in the world, who have been so far misled as to justify Profanations of the Lords Day. And <hi>Lutherans</hi> have pleaded for Graven Images, contrary to the second Commandment. But should such things be tolerated in <hi>N. E.</hi> we have reason to believe that the hot displeasure of God would soon burn against us. Besides, 
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000370_0027_0FA558E8494440E0"/>
it is more than we know, if one good man hath written in defence of mixt Dancings. One that hath written against Dancers, giveth his Book this Title, <hi>The Church of ungodly Men and Women whose King is Lucifer.</hi> But we cannot call to mind one Protestant Author who has been real for the interest of Reformation, that has set his Pen on work to plead for a practice so vile and infamous. This Objection turns upon Dancers thus, That practice with Holy Men in all ages have abhorred may well be suspected to be an evil practice: But it was shewed that this is true of promiscuous Dancing. We shall then conclude this Discourse with a double <hi>Corollary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Corol. 1. <hi>It is the Duty of Churches to exercise the Discipline of Christ towards such of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as shall offend in this matter.</hi> The Rule is clear and written with the Beams of the Sun, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>We command you, Brethren, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw your selves from every Brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the Tradition which he received from us.</hi> Now they that frequent Promiscuous Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings, or that send their Children thereunto, walk disorderly, and contrary to the Apostles Doctrine. It has been proved that such a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is a <hi>Scandalous Immorality,</hi> and therefore to be removed out of Churches by Discipline, which is the Broom of Christ, whereby he keeps his Churches clean. <hi>Zepperus</hi> and others 
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000370_0028_0FA558E8B7FE4250"/>
observe that it was by this means, that Churches in the Primitive times were preserved from this corruption. And thus it hath been in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. The National Synod held at <hi>Dort,</hi> Anno 1578. thus express themselves, <hi>Because Dances are for the most part attended with a Levity unbecoming Christians, and are an offence to the Godly, especially when practised in a time of common Danger and Calamity, they that go to Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, shall be reproved, and if after divers Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they persist therein, they are to be excluded from Communion.</hi> And several Provincial As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies in <hi>Holland,</hi> have declared that the sword of Discipline ought to be brandished again such Offenders, as <hi>Voetius</hi> testifieth (<hi>In Disput, de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsis mundi,</hi> p. 346, 347.) And the <hi>Reforming Synods</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> above an hundred years ago, did absolutely prohibit these Dances, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the use of Discipline against that evil: Once more in the printed Discipline of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches in <hi>France,</hi> p. 45. They have this Article, <hi>Dancing is to suppressed, and those that take the liberty or custom to Dance after they have been several times Admonished shall be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, when they shew themselves obstinate in their Rebellion. And the Consistories are exhorted well to put this Article into Execution, and to read the same publickly in the Name of God, and in the Authority of the Synods, and the said Synods and Conferences are exhorted to take heed of and warn 
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000370_0029_0FA558E98B02D900"/>
those Consistories that therein do not their Duties, to censure the Offenders for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And shall Churches in N. E. who have had a Name to be stricter and purer than other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, suffer such a scandalous evil amongst them? if all that are under Discipline be made sensible of this matter, we shall not be much or long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested with a <hi>Choreutical Daemon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corol.</hi> 2. <hi>Such Church-Members in</hi> N. E. <hi>as have sent their Children to be Practitioners or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators of mixt Dancing between young Men and Maidens, have cause to be deeply humbled.</hi> But stand still a while! what a word is here! <hi>Church-Members and their Children in</hi> N. E. <hi>at mixt</hi> D<hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces! Be astonished O ye Heavens!</hi> without doubt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham is ignorant of us, and Israel knoweth us not.</hi> If our Fathers should rise out of their Graves, they would not own such Children. It has been observed by several learned &amp; holy Men that <hi>Job</hi> giveth it as the Description and Character of ungodly ones: <hi>They send forth their little ones like a Flock, and their Children Dance, they take the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoyce at the sound of the Organs,</hi> Job 21. 11, 12. Mr. <hi>Caryls</hi> note on those words is, <hi>That worldly men breed their Children vainly.</hi> This is all their Religion. The Catechism which Wicked men teach their Children is to Dance and to Sing. Not that Dancing, or Musick, or Singing are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sinful: but if the Dancing Master be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:000370_0030_0FA558EA50D87C18"/>
they are commonly abused to lasciviousness, and that makes them to become abominable. But will you that are Professors of Religion have your Children to be thus taught? the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that you should give the Children who are Baptized into his Name another kind of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that you should bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord: And do you not hear the Lord Expostulating the case with you, and saying, you have taken my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Children that were given unto me; the Children that were solemnly engaged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Pomps of Satan; but is this a light matter that you have taken these my Children, and initiated them in the Pomps and Vanities of the Wicked one, contrary to your Covenant? What will you say in the day of the Lords plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you? we have that charity for you as to believe that you have erred through Ignorance, and not wickedly: and we have therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it our Duty to inform you in the Truth. If you resolve not on Reformation, you will be left inexcusable. However it shall be, we have now given our Testimony and delivered our own Souls. <hi>Consider what we say, and the Lord give you understanding in all things.</hi>
