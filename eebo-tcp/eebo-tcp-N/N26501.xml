            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHEN we explore the extenſive regions of the globe, and contemplate the many plants which the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent diſpoſer of all things has given as uſeful ornaments to the earth, and at the ſame time reflect that through the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or indolence of man, many of thoſe valuable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are permitted to wither in our fields or foreſts, without ever attracting the attention of thoſe mortals, for the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation of whoſe corporeal infirmities they were indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intended, many unpleaſant ideas muſt naturally intrude themſelves on our minds—Regret is awakened in our breaſts at the inactivity of our anceſtors, whoſe unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſloth has ſuffered diſeaſes to exiſt as <hi>opprobria medicinoe</hi> for the relief of which many plants inconteſtibly flouriſh, and which from inattention or ſome other omiſſion equally culpable, die neglected, and anſwer no valuable purpoſe but to fertilize the ſoil which gave them birth.</p>
            <p>The free inhabitants of the United States of America, would merit additional cenſure were they to evince a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſupineneſs. Poſſeſſed of pre-eminent advantages for rendering valuable acquiſitions to the Materia Medica, their neglect of ſuch purſuits would prove a national diſgrace, and be conſidered by their poſterity equally criminal as the moſt heinous offence againſt civil government.</p>
            <p>Inhabiting a vaſt extent of territory, it would be arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine goodneſs, not to ſuppoſe, that he has beſtowed with a liberal hand, ſources of alleviation to thoſe miſeries, which were incurred by the loſs of our primeval innocence</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:035231_0010_10017E942EC09CD8"/>
It has been juſtly obſerved by a very learned author,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rollin's Arts and Sciences.</note> that, "the ſtrength of a ſtate is not to be computed by extent of country, but by the number of its citizens, and the utility of their labour." This ſhould actuate us in the purſuit of uſeful knowledge, ſo as to render the extent of country which we inhabit more uſeful and more wealthy, whereby, not only our literary character as a nation, but alſo our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and independence will be effectually eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>That there are plants diffuſed all over the great conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of America, endued with the moſt active medical vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, is incontrovertible; but to uſe the words of the poet,
<q>
                  <l>Full many a flower is born to bluſh unſeen,</l>
                  <l>And waſte its ſweetneſs on the deſert air.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The induſtry and wiſdom of man are now the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites to develope thoſe virtues, and render them benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to mankind.</p>
            <p>To the honour of our inſant republic, the ſcience of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine has been laudably promoted by the invaluable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of the profeſſor of botany and materia medica in the univerſity of Pennſylvania, with a view to cultivate an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate acquaintance with the indigenous plants of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.—The literary ſame of this gentleman is too well known to require any eulogy from my pen; he has with as much ingenuity as induſtry, paved the way to facilitate the future reſearches of men of ſcience, and in language peculiarly pleaſing and deſcriptive, has given an agreeable animation to uſeful facts, ſo as to render them not only grateful to the reader, but alſo truly beneficial and intereſting.</p>
            <p>Were candidates for medical honours to purſue this laudable example of their preceptor, they would enrich the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035231_0011_10017E97065CD090"/>
Materia Medica with many valuable articles; but, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately for this branch of ſcience, a depraved predilection for the thread worn ſubject of diſeaſes, tempts them to launch their bark into the dangerous ſea of controverſy, and frequently without the neceſſary implements for the effectual execution of ſuch an undertaking.</p>
            <p>Attracted by the oſtentatious glare of hypothetical reaſoning, they frequently adopt with avidity theories the moſt extravagant and fallacious, and without examining the ſolidity of the opinions they embrace, confide entirely to the judgment of others, and with the greateſt temerity riſque their reputation on that unſubſtantial baſis.</p>
            <p>When philoſophy ſhall be eſteemed an indiſpenſable appendage to the medical character, then ſhall ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences ceaſe to exiſt. The ſuſceptible mind of man, enlightened by the rays of philoſophy, will then diſſipate the clouds of ignorance, and experimental enquiries ſhall then be cheriſhed as the ſureſt vehicles to truth.</p>
            <p>I have been prompted to adopt the ſubject of Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiana, not from any vain idea of my ability to do ample juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the medical qualities of this plant, but from an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious ſolicitude to contribute my mite towards the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one of the moſt uſeful branches of ſcience, and I truſt that from this conſideration, my experiments and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions will be examined with an eye of lenity, but, at the ſame time, with candour and impartiality. I have to regret extremely, that a ſerious indiſpoſition, for near two months, unfortunately precluded my entering as minutely into the analyſis of Tobacco, as I at firſt contemplated; but I have endeavoured to atone for this deficiency, by attending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035231_0012_10017E9889C82A68"/>
to its influence on the ſyſtem, and alſo to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective operations of its conſtituent parts.</p>
            <p>The exhibition of Nicotiana, as a medicine, for the mitigation of many diſeaſes to which mankind are incident, has been unfortunately but little attended to by phyſicians.</p>
            <p>The deleterious effects with which it is endowed, and the ſuppoſed danger of exhibiting it on this account, have led medical characters to depreciate the worth of a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, whoſe benign influence, by a judicious adminiſtration, in eradicating certain diſeaſes, has, in many inſtances, been evidently confirmed.</p>
            <p>It has been declared, by ſome ſuperficial obſervers, to be uſeleſs, from the repeated proofs of its inefficacy in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating the violence of thoſe diſeaſes, in which, many more accurate inquirers have aſſerted it proved beneficial. Others have alledged, that the baneful powers, with which it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, diſſuade from an uſe of it. In conſequence of theſe chimerical aſſertions, a medicine which would prove a valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acquiſition to the Materia Medica, has been almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely expunged from modern practice.</p>
            <p>If we were to admit ſuch injudicious opinions to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our reaſon, in ſelecting medical plants, how few would be the number which would engage the attention of the timid and injudicious practitioner! for in the hands of ſuch only are powerful medicines rendered injurious, and in the hands of ſuch alſo the moſt lenient prove obnoxious. The invaluable aphoriſm of Dr. Withering, therefore, merits the attention of every practitioner of medicine; he juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that, "poiſons in ſmall doſes are the beſt medicines, and the beſt medicines in too large doſes are poiſonous."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:035231_0013_10017E9AB48E50B0"/>
It would be as inconſiſtent to ſtigmatize this plant with the appellation of poiſon, as it would be to pronounce a crum of bread noxious in its quality, becauſe it has in ſome caſes entered the trachea, and occaſioned inſtantaneous death.</p>
            <p>The concluſions which I have formed on the ſubject which conſtitutes the ſubſequent pages of this diſſertation have been founded on experiments, and thoſe experiments, though few, have been conducted with accuracy. They have been mutually the ſources of much mental diſquietude, and the diffidence I now feel in ſubmitting them to the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny of the learned, tends conſiderably to augment the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable emotions which, at this time, diſturb my tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility: however, I ſhall conſider myſelf richly compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated for every inconvenience, ſhould any word or thought contained in theſe pages prove propitious in exciting ſome more accurate obſerver to a more minute inveſtigation of this copious ſubject.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I. The natural hiſtory of Tobacco, and of its firſt introduction as an article of luxury.</head>
               <p>WE have accounts, in different authors of ſeveral ſpecies and varieties of this plant, but as an accurate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of them may be acquired in almoſt every botanical book, it would be altogether uſeleſs for me to enter into an elaborate definition of each in particular. I ſhall therefore confine myſelf to that ſpecies which is thus deſignated by the great Linnaeus, "<hi>Nicotiana Tabacum:</hi> foliis lanceolato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovatis ſeſſilibus decurre<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is termed by Caſpar Bauhin, <hi>Nicotiana major lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folia.</hi> According to the natural method of Linnaeus, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the 28th order, called <hi>Luridae.</hi> Among the abori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines of the continent of America, it was diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of <hi>paetum,</hi> whilſt thoſe who inhabited the iſlands, called it <hi>yoli</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Encyclopedia.</note>.</p>
               <p>According to Sir Hans Sloane<note n="†" place="bottom">Sir Hans Sloane's Natural Hiſtory of Jamaica.</note>, its original name was <hi>picielt,</hi> but was termed <hi>tobacco</hi> by the Spaniards, from the circumſtance of its being brought from the iſland of <hi>Tobago,</hi> where it grew almoſt ſpontaneouſly.</p>
               <p>Tobacco was firſt introduced into Europe in the year 1559 by John Nicot, lord of Villemain, who was agent
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035231_0015_10017EA0001D4818"/>
in Portugal for the King of France, from whence he brought the plant, and preſented it to the Queen: from this circumſtance it was called <hi>Herba Regina,</hi> and in honor of him <hi>Nicotiana</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Theatrum Botanicum, page 711.</note>.</p>
               <p>Lobel and others accounted this, as well as the other ſpecies of Nicotiana, an <hi>Hyoſciamus</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Theatrum Botanicum.</note>, and called it <hi>Hyoſcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus luteus</hi> and <hi>dubius,</hi> in conſequence of which ſome have given it the Engliſh name of <hi>yellow Henbane.</hi> It is arranged by Linnaeus in his fifth claſs, <hi>Pentandria Monogynia</hi> the <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi> conſiſting of five <hi>ſubulated filaments,</hi> topped with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <hi>antherae;</hi> the <hi>ſtyle</hi> riſes from the rudiment of the fruit ſingle. The flowers are large and of a beautiful red, and annexed to long and ſlender foot-ſtalks: they are of a <hi>monopetalous tubelous</hi> form, and grow on the tops of the branches, and of the main ſtalk; the tube is longer than the cup, and the limb which ſpreads open is divided into five acute-pointed ſegments.</p>
               <p>The <hi>capſule</hi> which ſucceeds the flower is bivalved and bilocular, is alſo large, and of an oval form: it opens longitudinally, and ſheds extremely minute ſeeds, but very numerous.</p>
               <p>The root is divided into many parts, grows very thick and long, and is furniſhed with an infinity of ſmall fibres. The growth of this plant is generally from five to ſix feet in height, but ſometimes more, depending upon the ſeaſon, and fecundity of the ſoil. The ſtalk is ſubſtantial, round, very erect, and divided into branches. The leaves are large, numerous, and diſtributed in an alternate manner:
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035231_0016_100164AA2642C4F0"/>
they are of a deep green, and have petioli, or foot-ſtalks, but ſurround the common ſtalk, in great part at their baſe.</p>
               <p>Tobacco is a native of America, and was firſt ſent to Spain and different parts of Europe, for the purpoſe of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namenting their gardens, but ſo great was the demand for the dried leaves, that it at length became an article of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and is at this preſent period almoſt univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to as a <hi>luxury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Indians formerly made uſe of it as a <hi>vulnerary,</hi> and aſcribed many virtues to it as a medicine. They entertain an idea, that tobacco was brought them down from the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens by the Great Spirit, who deſcended for the expreſs purpoſe of preſenting them with this plant, in order that it might be ſpread throughout the land for the benefit of their ſpecies. Hence many nations of that tribe, make uſe of it in certain forms of their religion.—It is called by them <hi>Eche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Travellers aſſert, that they often reſort to the <hi>great mountain,</hi> where the angel appeared, and do homage to that ſpot, on which their anceſtors firſt received ſo divine a plant.</p>
               <p>It is alledged by Sir Hans Sloane,<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Hans Sloane's <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

They feign alſo to perfect radical cures among many of the diſeaſed, and ſo prejudiced are the people in their favour, as to imagine themſelves perfectly relieved. The form
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035231_0017_10017EA184C47D50"/>
which they obſerve on this occaſion, as related by Sir Hans Sloane, is in the following ſingular manner; "when they attempt to cure, they ſhut themſelves up with the ſick, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him, ſmoking him with the ſame; ſuck out of his ſhoulders what they ſay was his diſeaſe, ſhewing a ſtone or bone they kept in their mouths, which the women keep as relicks, thinking they facilitate birth."</p>
               <p>Thevet affirms that the women among the Aborigines of America were led away with an idea, that indulging in the uſe of tobacco was not only injurious to the body, but that it alſo prevented <hi>conception,</hi> and tended greatly to diminiſh the <hi>venereal appetite;</hi> in conſequence of which, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore the uſe of it in any form whatever.</p>
               <p>The Portugueſe attributed many virtues to this plant, and pronounced it a powerful <hi>counterpoiſon;</hi> hence they have given it the appellation of <hi>Herba Santa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sir Richard Greenfield, on his diſcovery of Virginia in 1585, obſerved that the Indians made great uſe of tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co in clay pipes, for the preſervation of their health. Pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the novelty of the circumſtance, he took ſeveral of the pipes with him on his return to England, which were introduced into court: others were made agreeable to their conſtruction, and from that period the uſe of ſmoking ſoon became general.</p>
               <p>It was firſt introduced among the Oriental nations by the Dutch<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Hans Sloane.</note> ſeamen, who uſed to carry pipes about them made of palm leaves, in which they ſmoked to eaſe their wearineſs. as well as ſuſpend a diſpoſition for food.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035231_0018_10017EA309823440"/>
The Indians after having gathered their crop of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, hang it up in their houſes for the purpoſe of curing, after this is perfected, they take four or five leaves, and wrap them up in the great leaf of a tree, in the form of a funnel; they then apply fire to the extremity, and inhale the ſmoke, which being frequently repeated, cauſes them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt three or four days<note n="*" place="bottom">It is univerſally acknowledged that tobacco does not impart any degree of nouriſhment to the body, but on the contrary tends greatly to <hi>reduce obeſity;</hi> yet ſuch is its ſtimulating quality, that it ſupports the ſyſtem for ſeveral days ſucceſſively, above what may be termed the <hi>hungry point.</hi> This is taken notice of by Mr. Kerr<note n="†" place="bottom">

"The eaſtern nations," ſays this author, "are ſo well convinced, by experience, of its powers in diminiſhing the appetite, that in the famine which prevailed in the Eaſt-Indies, in the year 1770, the wretched ſufferers purchaſed it at exhorbitant prices, to allay the cravings of hunger, and ſmooth the approach to death."</note>, without partaking of any aliment. They practiſe this more particularly, when they contemplate going to war, or are about to predict the termination of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture important events. It is conſidered by them as the moſt valuable offering that can be made to the beings that they worſhip. They uſe it in all their civil and religious ceremonies. When once the ſpiral wreaths of its ſmoke aſcend from the feathered pipe of peace, the compact that has been juſt made, is conſidered as ſacred and inviolable. Likewiſe when they addreſs their Great Father, or his guardian ſpirits, reſiding, as they believe, in every extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary production of nature, they make liberal offerings to them of this valuable plant, not doubting but that they are thus ſecured of protection<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Encyclopedia.</note>.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II. A conciſe account of the influence of Tobacco, on living ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems, illuſtrated by a few experiments.</head>
               <p>That tobacco is both a powerful emetic and cathartic, when exhibited in any form whatever, is generally admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: we find that all authors, who have written on its effects, have unanimouſly concurred in this opinion; ſome have alſo ſubſcribed to its being efficacious in promoting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſcharge; but with reſpect to its <hi>ſedative</hi> or <hi>ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> effects on the living ſyſtem, various opinions have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto exiſted.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the ſagacity and experience of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Fowler in many reſpects, the influence of Nicotiana on the human ſyſtem, in regard to its ſtimulating quality, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely eſcaped his attention.</p>
               <p>After drawing ſeveral inferences, relative to the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this medicine, in a concluding part of his work<note n="*" place="bottom">Fowler on Dropſy.</note>, he obſerves, that it poſſeſſes a ſedative quality<note n="†" place="bottom">A ſimilar opinion was formerly entertained of opium; but the ingenious experiments of Doctor Crumpe, muſt ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, to every unprejudiced mind, the <hi>ſtimulating quality</hi> of that medicine; and that its <hi>ſuppoſed ſedative effects,</hi> are ſolely to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to a ſecondary operation, or <hi>indirect</hi> debility induced by its immenſe ſtimulating property, when diſproportioned to the <hi>excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of the ſyſtem.</note>, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently proves laxative: on this account he ſuppoſes that
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035231_0020_10017EA8429915B8"/>
it may prove ſalutary in many painful caſes, where coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may render opiates exceptionable.</p>
               <p>That it is a laxative, I have almoſt uniformly obſerved, but with reſpect to its being endued with a ſedative quality the ſubſequent experiments will greatly invalidate.</p>
               <p>It is not my intention or wiſh to enter into the field of controverſy on this head, and therefore I have attempted to define by experiments, the unequivocal operation of this plant. It is unqueſtionably the moſt ſubſtantial baſis on which we can found our arguments, and to ſuch we muſt ultimately appeal for the attainment of truth.</p>
               <p>The ſtimulating effects of tobacco did not eſcape the diſcerning eye of Doctor Cullen, whoſe opinions ſhould ever be viewed with veneration and reſpect.</p>
               <p>In treating of this plant, he obſerves, that "the infuſion of tobacco when it is carried into the blood veſſels, has ſometimes ſhewn its ſtimulating powers exerted in the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; and very lately we have had it recommended to us as a powerful diuretic of great ſervice in dropſy<note n="‡" place="bottom">Cullen's Materia Medica, page 191.</note>."</p>
               <p>That tobacco promotes the <hi>renal</hi> diſcharge, is beyond a point of controverſy. Every practitioner of medicine who has ever had occaſion to adminiſter it, either in the form of infuſion or ſubſtance, muſt have obſerved its <hi>diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retic</hi> influence on the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:035231_0021_10017EAA6A7E9210"/>
This is ſufficiently exemplified in the work of Doctor Fowler<note n="*" place="bottom">See Fowler on Dropſy, page 72, where he obſerves that out of one hundred and fifteen caſes in which he adminiſtered tobacco, in ninety-three of them it proved diuretic.</note>, to whom we are greatly indebted for the ſeries of experiments enumerated by him. He has clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated the influence of tobacco in promoting the urinary ſecretion, and has as perſpicuouſly evinced the utility of its exhibition in violent caſes of Aſcites, Anaſarca, and Dyſury.</p>
               <p>Without a further diſquiſition relative to the operation of tobacco on the human ſyſtem, I ſhall proceed with enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating my experiments, and will leave it to the candid reader to judge how far they may merit his attention; they deſerve at leaſt the credit of being faithfully related.</p>

In twenty he obſerved that he felt a little ſick, and that the room appeared to him to be turning round, as he expreſſed himſelf; his face was much fluſhed, and on the thirtieth minute, he complained of a tremor in his hands.

                  <p>Notwithſtanding the deleterious effects of tobacco hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto enumerated, its operation as a medicine frequently proves ſalutary; this has been clearly demonſtrated in many violent caſes of obſtinate diſeaſe, and as ſuch it is to be held in the higheſt eſtimation.

               <p>THE uſe of tobacco as an <hi>article of luxury,</hi> in all its noxious forms, comes now to be conſidered; but before entering into the particulars of each, I muſt beg leave to offer a few preliminary obſervations. It is generally admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that "man is an imitative animal;" to adopt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from the example of others, what is pleaſurable to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035231_0033_10017EC0EAD55500"/>

It is alledged by Dr. Cullen in his materia medica,<note n="†" place="bottom">Cullen's Materia Medica, p. 189.</note> that this plant evidently poſſeſſes a <hi>narcotic power,</hi> and through this
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035231_0034_10017EC3DEB38710"/>
means, weakens the tone of the ſtomach in ſuch a manner as to preclude the performance of its reſpective functions.</p>
               <p>From the preceding experiments, it has been aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that nicotiana poſſeſſes ſtrong <hi>ſtimulant</hi> qualities, and therefore, Dr. Cullen's <hi>narcotic power,</hi> is to be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſtimuly being carried too far, and thereby induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>indirect debility.</hi> To corroborate this poſition, I will relate the following ſingular fact, which not long ſince came under my own inſpection.</p>
               <p>A young gentleman, after being ſomewhat intoxicated by drinking of wine, undertook for the firſt time, the ſmoking of a ſegar; after having inhaled it as long as he could with ſafety to his mouth, he obſerved that it was cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary for gentlemen to fling away the remaining part of the ſegar; but, for his part, he thought it extremely incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, and highly improper, and, as he expreſſed himſelf, to ſhew his oeconomy, would put it to a better uſe, by chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather than part with ſo <hi>ineſtimable a treaſure:</hi> but unfortunately for the poor youth, he had not gratified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf long in the enjoyment of his luſcious morſel, before he fell proſtrate on his back, to the great aſtoniſhment of all the ſurrounding company, until they recognized the cauſe of ſo unexpected a tranſition. He was conveyed to an adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent room, where he remained apparently lifeleſs for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſpace of time, and would probably have fallen a martyr to his folly and imprudence, had not medical aid been near at hand: The attendant phyſician accurately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected his caſe, and very properly abſtracted twelve or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ounces of blood from his arm;<note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Allſton, of South-Carolina, informed me, that he was called to a lady, who had intentionally taken a doſe of laudanum, for the purpoſe of deſtroying life. He haſtened to her aſſiſtance, and immediately adminiſtered a vomit, but without producing the deſired effect. The doſe was repeated and with the ſame reſult. He then abſtracted a few ounces of blood, and vomiting immediately enſued, which reſtored the woman to health.</note> when a vomiting en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035231_0035_10017EC5635B0A68"/>
attended with a profuſe diaphoreſis, which happily diſſipated every doubt of his recovery, and ſoon reſtored the youth to his former ſtate of ſalubrity.</p>
               <p>We may infer from this fact, the infinite power of ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotiana, when uſed by thoſe who have never been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to its noxious effects.</p>
               <p>Smoking has been alledged by ſome authors to have oftentimes proved advantageous in diſpelling contagion of almoſt every deſcription; but others have oppoſed this aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with ſuch valid arguments, and have produced ſuch ſubſtantial facts in ſupport of their opinions, that it is now almoſt univerſally believed, that tobacco poſſeſſes no ſuch virtue.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed with ſome few remarks on ſnuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing, another form in which the deleterious effects of Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiana are evidently depicted.</p>
               <p>Snuffing, like that of ſmoking, may, by many repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, be rendered perfectly ſimple and harmleſs with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to its nauſeating powers at firſt, ſo that its peculiarities may at length be totally diſſipated: tho' even this does not evade the force of its action over thoſe who practiſe its uſe in certain quantities, for we find that thoſe very perſons accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to the taking of ſnuff, by exceeding the portion li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, are attacked with every diſagreeable ſymptom,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035231_0036_10017EC78A8C9790"/>
which they ſo evidently experienced on the firſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
               <p>"On this ſubject" ſays Dr. Cullen, "it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that the power of habit is often unequal; ſo that perſons accuſtomed to the uſe of tobacco, a leſſer quantity, than what they had been accuſtomed to, will often have ſtronger effects than had before commonly appeared. I knew a lady who had been for more than twenty years ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to take ſnuff, and that at every time of day; but ſhe came at length to obſerve, that ſnuffing a good deal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dinner, took away her appetite: and ſhe came at length to find, that a ſingle pinch, taken any time before dinner, took away almoſt entirely her appetite for that meal. When however, ſhe abſtained entirely from ſnuff before dinner, her appetite continued as uſual; and after dinner, for the reſt of the day, ſhe took ſnuff, pretty freely, without any inconvenience<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullen's Materia Medica, page 187.</note>."</p>
               <p>This is further corroborated by an aſſertion of Doctor Ruſh's<note n="†" place="bottom">Profeſſor Ruſh's M. S. Lectures.</note> "I once attended a gentleman," ſays the Doctor, "who had been for ſome time troubled with pains in his ſtomach, attended with a diminution of appetite, and ſome degree of emaciation. I obſerved that he frequently prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed the taking of ſnuff, to which I attributed his diſeaſe, and adviſed him to ſuſpend the uſe of it. He accordingly did ſo, and ſoon began to mend very faſt. I was informed by him, a few weeks after, that he had gained thirty weight in fleſh, and was at that period, in the enjoyment of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:035231_0037_10017EC9AD8BC270"/>
It greatly injures the organs of ſmelling, as the infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of nerves, which are diffuſed throughout the mucous membrane of the noſe, on which depends its ſenſibility, and the acuteneſs of our ſmelling, become conſiderably impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the acrimony of ſnuff. "The uſe of this ſubtile powder, is further rendered odious by diſcolouring the ſkin contiguous to the noſe, and will taint the ſweeteſt breath with the rank odour of a tobacco-caſk. For this reaſon the ladies of faſhion in France, ſeldom take ſnuff till they are married; a very high compliment no doubt to their huſbands."</p>
               <p>"The only advantage," ſays Dr. Leake<note n="*" place="bottom">Leake on the viſcera, page 69.</note>, "of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſnuff, is that of ſneezing, which, in ſluggiſh, phlegmatic habits, will give univerſal concuſſion to the body, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a more free circulation of the blood; but of this benefit, ſnuff-takers are deprived, from being familiar with its uſe."</p>
               <p>Chewing, the moſt odious form in which nicotiana can poſſibly be uſed, next engages our attention.</p>
               <p>The conſtant chewing of tobacco impairs the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, in a ſimilar manner to ſmoking, from a profuſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of ſaliva by expectoration<note n="‡" place="bottom">Dr. Cullen obſerves that "this practice is alſo the occaſion of the greateſt waſte of ſaliva; and the effects of this in weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing digeſtion, and perhaps from thence eſpecially, its acted effect of producing emaciation may appear. Cullen's Materia Medica, page 190.</note>, ſo neceſſary for the preſervation of the body, particularly in perſons of a thin habit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:035231_0038_100164B223FA53C0"/>
The nauſeous taſte of the plant being more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately abſtracted by this proceſs, than either of the others hitherto mentioned, precludes its being carried ſo far by thoſe who have recourſe to it, without conſiderable danger attending ſuch a procedure. Perſons, therefore, who are deſirous of effecting their cuds in this <hi>polite accompliſhment,</hi> are compelled to be extremely particular in regard to the quantity, and time of uſing it, for if continued too long with a <hi>novice in this art,</hi> we find evident marks of its oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning extreme anxiety, vertigoes, ſtupors, and diſorders of the ſenſes. Notwithſtanding the greateſt caution of tobacco-chewers, a ſmall portion of the ſaliva, tinctured with this plant, will frequently inſinuate itſelf into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and thereby impair the functions of that viſcus.</p>
               <p>As longevity depends on a healthy ſtate of this organ, being one of the moſt important throughout the animal oeconomy, the habits of thoſe who addict themſelves to this pernicious cuſtom become vitiated, and conſequently, the number of their days are conſiderably ſhortened. But, as the uſe of tobacco in this form, moſt generally prevails among the vulgar, upon whom friendly admonitions are too frequently thrown away, I ſhall not dwell long on the ſubject; well knowing the great difficulty of eradicating prejudice from ignorant minds, though a circumſtance much to be regretted.</p>

            <div n="4" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IV. Of the prejudicial effects of the uſe of Tobacco on the moral faculty.</head>
               <p>The general demand for tobacco, as an article of luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is owing, I am convinced, to a ſervile attachment for
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035231_0039_10017ECC79C448C8"/>
imitation. Many cuſtoms equally odious, have of late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come faſhionable from the ſame cauſe, and it is to be regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that men whoſe exalted ſituations in life ought to have rendered them ſuperior to ſuch weakneſſes, have been the principle propagators of theſe pernicious practices. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſuch characters is, unfortunately, eſteemed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the more ſubordinate walks of life, as the ſtandard of human perfection; hence when vicious cuſtoms are brought into uſe by men of this deſcription, the impreſſion which is made on illiterate minds is more durable, and the proſpect of eradicating them more gloomy.</p>
               <p>This plant was firſt introduced into England by Sir Walter Raleigh, about the year 1585; this nobleman uſed it in the form of ſegar, and hence the deſpicable habit of ſmoking was ſpeedily contracted by the inhabitants of that kingdom.</p>
               <p>I preſume, our forefathers, muſt have borrowed this cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom from the aborigines of America, as we are informed, theſe Savages uſed it long before it was introduced into the civilized world.</p>
               <p>Our anceſtors then, have entailed one of the moſt odious vices on their ſons and daughters; for ſorry am I to obſerve, that this plant is uſed by females, as well as males.</p>
               <p>Their delicate habits, it was to have been hoped, would have prevented them from the luxurious uſe of ſuch a nauſeous weed, but fatal experience has taught us, that our expectations were merely the reſults of benevolence; with exalted notions of female delicacy, blended with a natural affection for the ſex, we fondly anticipated, that they would
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035231_0040_10017ECE01C527D0"/>
preſerve themſelves aloof from ſuch a deteſtable cuſtom, and therefore expected that a ſegar would never find ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance within their ruby lips.</p>
               <p>How far theſe expectations have been realiſed, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will declare.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this plant is not ſolely confined to thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, who have paſſed the meridian of life, for in ſuch a caſe the evil would not be ſo great, but the young and the bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo delight in inhaling the fumes of tobacco; from this ſource we may expect much miſchief, for as habit will render this weed as eſſential to their happineſs, as their daily food; ſo alſo we will naturally ſee the riſing generation, fondly allured to a ſimilar attachment.</p>
               <p>It is granted that ſmoking, or chewing, univerſally produce thirſt, therefore a deſire for ſtrong drink is excited; and as theſe, when taken between meals, are generally the forerunners of intemperance and drunkenneſs, ſo alſo is vice univerſally the conſequence. This is proved beyond the poſſibility of doubt, by Dr. Ruſh<note n="*" place="bottom">Ruſh's Eſſays, page 270.</note> in his obſervations on the uſe of tobacco; he obſerves its influence in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting intemperance, in the following words—"One of the greateſt ſots," ſays the Doctor, "I ever knew, acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a love for ardent ſpirits, by ſwallowing cuds of tobacco, which he did, to eſcape detection in the uſe of it, for he had contracted the habit of chewing, contrary to the advice and commands of his father. He died of a dropſy under my care in the year 1780."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:035231_0041_10017ED0305C43A8"/>
From this fact we ſee, in the moſt undiſguiſed manner, the pernicious effects of this weed, not only on the morals, but on the health, and ought we not then to endeavour to wean ourſelves from the uſe of a plant, which evidently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs our ability for living as rational beings, and inſures for us an early grave?</p>
               <p>We daily witneſs the horrid effects of inebriety, in our intercourſe with the world; a train of evils are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, which totally diſqualify the ſlaves of it from living in the poliſhed walks of ſociety; they become objects of pity, and contempt, by men of genius and w<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excluded from the ſociety of ſuch, they fly to the haunts of vice, and frequently end their days, in a tavern or a brothel.</p>
               <p>Idleneſs is alſo generated by the uſe of tobacco, and though it cannot be conſidered ſo immediately deſtructive to health and moral rectitude, as the habit of drunkenneſs, yet the effects are equally extenſive, though ſlower in their operation. The ſocial duties of life are neglected, and every thing valuable and intereſting is totally diſregarded. Our country, our connections, and our friends become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of but little regard, and finally we attain to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in indolence, that even the neceſſary duties of life, which only extend to ourſelves, are conſidered as burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and at laſt totally neglected.</p>
               <p>Theſe are generally the effects of a ſervile fondneſs for tobacco; and I could enumerate many more, if my time would admit, which are equally diſguſting in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;—but, as cuſtom has rendered this plant ſo eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035231_0042_10017ED337DEE310"/>
to the happineſs of many of our fellow citizens, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected that theſe, or any other remarks, would have a tendency to diſcourage the uſe.</p>

which continued conſtant for two hours.

In eight minutes, I began to perſpire, and in fifteen and eighteen minutes, the perſpiration increaſed moſt profuſely, particularly on my upper extremities, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. At ten minutes, I felt giddy, and ſoon became ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiginous, with an evident tremor throughout my frame. Theſe effects went off at thirty five minutes. I vomited four times, <abbr>viz.</abbr> at the 20th, 35th, 50th and 90th minutes. This vomiting was as violent, as I have ever experienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from tartar emetic. During the whole time I belched a great deal. After theſe affections ſubſided, I voided urine, and felt diſpoſed for a paſſage downwards, but being late at night, I did not indulge myſelf.</p>

                     <p>N. B. I took particular care not to examine my pulſe after vomiting, until the expiration of five minutes; and always before noting it, I remained ſtill in one poſture, at leaſt two minutes, in order that it might not be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by exertions of any kind.</p>

I ſhall, therefore, without further comment paſs them over, and proceed to an exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the fifth experiment, where we have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of obſerving the ſtimulating effects of tobacco, when applied externally to an irritable ſurface.</p>
               <p>In reviewing the ſixth experiment, we find that Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotiana proves a gentle emetic, when externally applied to the body, which fact is alſo corroborated, by an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my friend Mr. Dart's, already taken notice of. In caſes where internal emetics may be objected to, this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation may be adopted with little or no inconvenience, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as its operation is of a very lenient nature.</p>
               <p>In regard to the experiments made on the mice, it is to be obſerved, that death was almoſt an immediate attendant on each. I diſſected ſeveral of theſe animals after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of life, in order to ſee if I could trace any marks
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035231_0056_10017EF0208B2570"/>
of inflammation. In two or three that I opened, no viſible effects were produced; in others, the minute blood veſſels throughout the inteſtines, were ſomewhat florid, but perhaps this might have proceeded from ſome other cauſe. Here it may be preſumed, that the <hi>exceſſive ſtimulating quality</hi> of this plant, was diſproportioned to the <hi>excitability</hi> of their ſyſtems, and conſequently death was induced, before any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory type</hi> could poſſibly have taken place.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Ruſh remarks that the ſame frequently occurred, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who died ſuddenly of the yellow fever.

               </p>
               <p>With reſpect to the conſtituent parts of tobacco, we find, agreeable to the eleventh experiment, that it poſſeſſes an extract conſiſting of a gum and reſin, two ounces of which afforded three drachms of pure reſin. From the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral experiments that I have made, the moſt active proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this plant conſiſts in the reſinous portion.</p>
               <p>The aſhes obtained from the twelfth experiment, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a large portion of vegetable alkali, as is ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed from the teſts enumerated. The fourteenth expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment afforded cryſtals of the carbonate of pot-aſh and common ſalt; from the fifteenth was obtained the ſulphate of alumine.</p>
               <p>Cryſtals of the oxalic acid, were procured from the ſixteenth experiment. The ſeventeenth afforded a water ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely pungent when applied to the tongue, and the oil which floated on its ſurface was very acrid, when in contact with a denuded ſurface of the body. We may perceive from
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035231_0057_10017EF1A5212080"/>
the reſults of the 18th and 19th experiments, the difference exiſting between the gum and reſin, for both of the men on whom theſe experiments were performed, were of the ſame temperament, and occaſionally practiſed the chewing of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco. From the twentieth experiment, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Mr. Lee, we ſee clearly manifeſted the immenſe power of the reſinous portion of the extract, and its virtue as a medicine, occaſioning nauſea, a profuſe perſpiration, and at length vomiting.</p>
               <p>Tobacco appears to be unequivocally a powerful dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretic, and as ſuch it has proved efficacious in a variety of diſeaſes. It is to be regretted that its exhibition is not oftener repeated; for there are teſtimonies of its ſalutary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in many obſtinate fevers, which predominated over the moſt powerful remedies which are eſteemed valuable for exciting a ſpeedy and profuſe perſpiration.</p>
               <p>The twenty-firſt and twenty ſecond experiments, evince the immenſe power which the diſtilled water poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: phyſicians formerly made uſe of it with advantage, and I entertain not the ſmalleſt doubt, but that, with a proper dilution, it may now be adminiſtered with much efficacy.</p>
               <p>The twenty-third, twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, clearly demonſtrate the emetic and purgative qualities of this plant; and the twenty-ſixth, twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and twenty-eighth, again elucidate the difference ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting between the gum and reſin; for, agreeable to theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, we find that one half of the latter, operated more powerfully than twice the quantity of the former.</p>
               <p>The immenſe acrimony of the diſtilled water, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently

               <head>An account of its medical virtues, in eradicating certain diſeaſes.</head>
               <p>THE medical powers of tobacco were generally known among phyſicians, at an early period, who aſcribed many virtues to it in certain obſtinate diſeaſes. With reſpect to its operation as a general evacuant, I may, from my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, and the corroborating aſſertions of various authors, pronounce this medicine a valuable acquiſition to the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria medica; and that its evident operation on the ſyſtem, is that of <hi>a ſudorific</hi> an <hi>emetic,</hi> a <hi>cathartic</hi> and a <hi>diuretic.</hi> Hence the propriety of its uſe, in a variety of diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>In caſes of aſcites and other dropſical affections, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be an invaluable remedy.</p>
               <p>As a diuretic, I would venture to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled by few, if any of our indigenous plants. The <hi>digi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis purpured,</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035231_0059_10017EF58C17A078"/>
has been much celebrated for its diuretic quality, by medical characters; but I have ſeen inſtances where the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco has eradicated ſeveral violent caſes of <hi>aſcites,</hi> where this had proved but of little effect. "Diuretics," ſays a much celebrated character,<note n="†" place="bottom">See profeſſor Barton's they towards a <hi>materia medica</hi> of the United States. Page 34.</note> "have ſo long been employed with benefit in the treatment of dropſies, that it becomes a matter of conſequence, to increaſe the number of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of this claſs, and to learn how to exhibit, with more advantage, thoſe which are already known." In how great eſtimation then ſhould we hold that plant, which is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endowed with a power of evacuating the accumulated water by a natural diſcharge, for the relief of aſcites and other dropſical affections, in lieu of reſorting to a ſurgical operation, which is painful and diſagreeable to the afflicted patient; that nicotiana poſſeſſes this quality, no one will pretend to deny.</p>
               <p>Every practitioner of medicine, who has attentively peruſed the publication of the ingenious Doctor Fowler, on the effects of Tobacco, with reſpect to its diuretic quality, muſt candidly acknowledge its ſalutary effects, in caſes of dropſy and dyſury. The uniform reſult atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on his experiments, together with the many proofs of its virtues which have come under my cognizance, clearly evince the indefinite worth of this plant, and the neceſſity of adminiſtering it in thoſe caſes of dropſy, which ſeem to triumph over medicines of leſs efficacy, although held in the greateſt repute.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this ſtill further, I have been informed by ſeveral perſons of unqueſtionable veracity, that a variety
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035231_0060_10017EF9400E9A48"/>
of the moſt violent caſes of dropſy, many of which had baffled the ſkill of the moſt eminent phyſicians, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly eradicated by an old negro fellow. His remedy was, for a time, unknown to any but himſelf, until, by ſome accidental occurrence, it was diſcovered to be a ſimple decoction of tobacco, diſguiſed with ſome odoriferous herb. As an additional proof of the efficacy of this plant in the various ſpecies of dropſy, I ſhall take the liberty of introducing the opinion of Dr. Cullen, when conſidering the effects of vomiting, in promoting abſorption, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by relieving patients affected with dropſy. "Spontaneous vomiting," ſays the Dr. has ſometimes excited an abſorption in hydropic parts, and thereby drawn off the waters lodged in them, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that vomiting excited by art, may have the ſame effect; and accordingly it has been often practiſed with advantage<note n="*" place="bottom">Cullen's Firſt lines Vol. II. page 407.</note>." The doctor then proceeds with obſerving, "that there are no means we can employ to procure a copious evacuation of ſerous fluids, with greater certainty than the operation of purgatives, and it is upon theſe accounts, that purging is the evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which has been moſt frequently, and perhaps with moſt ſucceſs, employed in dropſy<note n="†" place="bottom">Cullen's Practice of Phyſic. Vol. II. page 408.</note>." He further remarks "that the kidneys afford a natural outlet for a great part of the watery fluids, contained in the blood veſſels; and the increaſing the excretions by the kidneys<note n="‡" place="bottom">It is remarked by Dr. Sydenham, when treating of diuretics in drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Doctor Wallis obſerves that the aſhes of tobacco, has oftentimes proved efficacious in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of dropſy. Wallis's Sydenham. Vol. II. page 289.</note> to a conſiderable degree, is a means, as likely, as any other of exciting an abſorption in dropſical parts. It is upon this account that
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035231_0061_10017EFAC4613358"/>
diuretic medicines have been always properly employed in the cure of dropſy. It happens however, unluckily, that none of <hi>them</hi> are of a <hi>very certain operation</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Fowler obſerves on this head, that ſuch conſiderations firſt induced him to make trial of a greater variety of diuretic medicines in dropſical caſes, than have generally been uſed; in hopes of finding ſome one, more efficacious than the reſt: and he flatters himſelf, he may recommend, as ſuch, the celebrated Indian plant commonly called Tobacco.</note>". He then proceeds by announcing the utility of ſudorifics, in many caſes of dropſical affections, and affirms, that they have proved ſalutary in many inſtances.</p>
               <p>As I have had ſome opportunities of witneſſing the happy effects of tobacco, and its various operations on the ſyſtem, I would beg leave to obſerve that all theſe virtues hitherto enumerated by Doctor Cullen, appear to be, under certain circumſtances, concentrated in this plant; from my experience, I may venture to aſſert, with ſome degree of confidence, that it has proved of ineſtimable worth for the relief of patients afflicted with dropſy.</p>
               <p>In reviewing what I have written on the medical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of this plant, I perceive that my limited information has prevented me from doing ample juſtice to the ſubject: in order, therefore, to extenuate my deficiencies, I ſhall

apply to the learned pages of Doctor Fowler<note n="*" place="bottom">See Doctor Thomas Fowler's Medical reports of the Effects of Tobacco.</note> for aid, in accompliſhing the deſign of this undertaking.</p>
               <p>In this work ſo replete with medical information, many intereſting facts may be collected; and I truſt that it will be found on an impaſſioned examination of our experiments, that I have not departed from truth, not built my opinions on conjecture.</p>
               <p>Doctor Fowler obſerves that a paragraph, in the third volume of Dr. Duncan's very valuable medical commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, firſt induced him to adminiſter tobacco. It was part of a letter, from Dr. Garden of Charleſton South-Carolina, to Dr. Hope of Edinburgh; wherein he ſays—"Here we uſe with ſurprizingly great efficacy, in dropſical caſes, the alkaline fixed ſalt of tobacco, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Doctor Fowler remarks that a variety of operations, in different authors, have been aſcribed to this plant, and that he was led from this circumſtance to aſcertain more particularly its virtues; being ſolicitous of eſtabliſhing his opinions on a more ſubſtantial baſis than the aſſertions of others, he reſolved on entering into a minute inveſtigation of the ſubject, and conſequently founded the poſitions there ſtated, on his own experience and obſervation.</p>
               <p>The reſult of this enquiry, has afforded him very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ideas upon the ſubject, and from the number of facts enumerated by him, we may infer, that tobacco, under proper regulations, may be adminiſtered internally, not only as a ſafe, but as an efficacious, and valuable remedy; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035231_0063_10017EFEB0F42E48"/>

                     <p>To illuſtrate the manner of its exhibition, and alſo its ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary effects in many caſes, I will take the liberty of Inſerting a few extracts from Dr. Fowler, as related by him, and which were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of his own obſervations.</p>
                     <p>It appears from many experiments, ſays the Doctor, that the average doſe for an adult, ſufficient to produce the deſired effect, will be about eighty drops of the infuſion; or to ſpeak with ſome latitude, from ſixty drops to one hundred, and to be repeated twice a day.</p>
                     <p>The propereſt times for adminiſtering the medicine, are two hours before dinner, and at bed-time; it being obſerved to diſagree the moſt with the ſtomach, in a morning faſting. And ſuch is the difference between morning and night, that almoſt every patient will require to take one fourth, and ſome even one third leſs, in the forenoon, than in the evening; in order to enable them to bear the doſes, with equal convenience.

                     <p>The common doſe juſt mentioned, relate only to adults of an ordinary conſtitution; for it deſerves particular notice, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween conſtitutions, which are very nervous and irritable, and thoſe which are very robuſt, or torpid, or long accuſtomed to the uſe of tobacco, the doſes will admit of very great, and ſurpriſing varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     <p>Seeing the diverſity of doſes is ſo great, I would lay it down as a rule, by way of caution, to begin with ſixty drops, or three fourths of the medium-doſe, in a caſe of a delicate conſtitution; and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of drops, by five, eight or ten at a time, till by their obvious effects on the ſyſtem, the proper doſe ſhall be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p>But if the patient ſhould be a male, and the conſtitution robuſt, torpid, or accuſtomed to the uſe of tobacco, we may ſafely venture to begin with eighty, ninety, or one hundred drops; and thus, with more expedition, regulate the future doſes according to the effects.</p>

               <p>Exp. 2. Ten grains of calomel were ſuſpended in a ſmall quantity of water. Another worm of the ſame ſpecies was introduced into this mixture, which was conſiderably affected in three minutes, in ten ſtill more ſo, in fifteen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſubſide; in thirty it remained perfectly dormant.</p>
               <p>At the expiration of an hour, ſtill alive, but continued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, unleſs diſturbed.</p>
               <p>Exp. 3. In a ſolution of white ſugar I introduced another worm, as above; it was convulſed in five minutes; in ten theſe ſymptoms were ſomewhat diminiſhed; in fifteen remained quiet at the bottom of the veſſel, and in forty it appeared perfectly inanimate.</p>
               <p>Exp. 4. In the diſtilled water of tobacco, which was extremely pungent, I immerſed another worm, which almoſt inſtantaneouſly contorted itſelf into a variety of forms, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting ſtrong marks of violent pain, and in the ſhort lapſe of three minutes it expired.</p>
               <p>Exp. 5. Five grains of corroſive ſublimate, diſſolved in water, produced convulſions in two minutes, and a torpor in twelve.</p>

Exp. 6. Molaſſes produced convulſions in five mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and inactivity in twenty-five.</p>
               <p>Exp. 7. A ſtrong decoction of pink root, brought on convulſions in ſeven minutes, and a torpor in thirty.</p>
               <p>We find, from the ſeveral preceding experiments, that tobacco, as an <hi>anthelmintic,</hi> is deſerving of being held in high repute.</p>
               <p>Several of the moſt powerful medicines, whoſe virtues as a vermifuge, are in the greateſt eſtimation, appear to be but <hi>feeble</hi> in their operation, when compared with the great influence of tobacco in the expulſion of worms.</p>
               <p>The celebrated Spigelia Marylandica of Linnaeus, it muſt be acknowledged, is very generally deſtructive to worms; but, agreeable to the firſt and ſeventh experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, under the head of anthelmintics, we find that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco appears to be more inſtantaneous in its operation, though, perhaps ultimately, not more effectual. Yet, from its more immediate effect on thoſe animals, I ſhould rather preſume, that it merits the particular attention of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, as a valuable medicine, and that, on this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would, unqueſtionably be expedient to give it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated trials in thoſe caſes, which may reſiſt the more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble operation of other anthelmintics.<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>It may be just, therefore, to infer, that <hi>the tobacco infuſion</hi> may be adminiſtered with very good effect.</p>

               <head>As a Cathartic.</head>
               <p>In caſes of conſtipations of the abdominal viſcera, the infuſion of tobacco has ſometimes been adminiſtered, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with immediate relief by occaſioning a ſpeedy expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the obſtructing indurated foeces. The ſmoke,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>A gentleman of my particular acquaintance informed me, that he was not in the habit of ſmoking much, but whenever he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with any degree of coſtiveneſs, it was only reſorting to a ſegar to obviate this inconvenience, which never failed of acting as a leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent purgative, and imparted immediate relief. This method he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the taking of phyſic, as it was mild in its effects, and left his body agreeably compoſed.</p>
                     <p>If the generality of perſons were to relinquiſh the perpetual uſe of this plant and only to have recourſe to it for its medicinal virtues, when neceſſity demanded, is it not more than probable, that many diſeaſes may be eradicated, or at leaſt their violence mitigated by its ſalutary influence?</p>
                  </note> ſays Dr. Cullen, thrown up the rectum, will operate in like manner, and has proved beneficial, after the failure of many violent cathartics; it enters much further into the inteſtines than injections commonly do, and is thereby applied to a larger ſurface, by which means it may be rendered much more powerful than the infuſion.</p>
               <p>It is to be regretted, ſays Dr. Fowler, that injections of tobacco are not in more general uſe, for I am thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded, that in caſes of the colic, they would prove more ſucceſsful than any other kind with which we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</p>
               <p>From the many facts and obſervations which I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto adduced, relative to the medicinal influence of tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, it is, doubtleſs, reaſonable to infer, that it may prove efficacious in many diſeaſes.</p>

That it is of great ſervice in dropſical affections, has been clearly demonſtrated; and, in caſes of dyſury, it has, in many inſtances, proved ſalutary, by ſucceſsfully promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a copious diſcharge of urine. In ſhort, much may be ſaid of its virtues as a medicine, but as it is not my wiſh to prove prolix, by profuſely extending encomiums on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digenous plant, ſo univerſally known, I ſhall conclude by obſerving, that the errors and imperfections of this eſſay, are, no doubt, eaſily diſcernible: but, at the ſame time, I am buoyed up, with the flattering idea, that the candid reader will readily excuſe a juvenile attempt.</p>
               <p>As an expanded field lies open before us, for inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I would wiſh, that the ſubject might be hereafter taken up, by ſome more adequate experimentaliſt, as I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the complicated operative effects of tobacco on the human ſyſtem, would render it an invaluable medicine in many obſtinate diſeaſes.</p>
