            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Rev. Mr. <hi>Maccarthy</hi>'s Account of the Behaviour of Mrs. <hi>Spooner</hi> after her Commitment and Condemnation for being Acceſſary in the Murder of her Huſband at <hi>Brookfield,</hi> 
               <date>March 1. 1778.</date>
            </head>
            <p>MRS. <hi>Spooner</hi> profeſſed that her match with her Huſband was not agreeable to her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>— Domeſtic diſſentions ſoon took place, and went on from ſtep to ſtep, till ſhe conceived an utter aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him; at length ſhe meditated his deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; laid ſeveral plans, and never gave over till the fatal act was committed. Her guilt in this manner appeared in moſt flagrant colours upon her trial as well as ſince, from the ſolemn declaration of the poor men whom ſhe employed in the bloody deed, and to whom ſhe promiſed a large reward, which reward they immediately received.</p>
            <p>I ſoon viſited her after her commitment. She was not very free to converſe upon the ſubject. And indeed it was difficult to converſe freely upon it till after her trial. After this, opportunity was given in the fulleſt manner. She did not blame judges or jurors or the Attorney-General, but often declared that the witneſſes wronged her. She declared, that <hi>though ſhe had planned the matter, yet that ſhe never thought it would be executed; that ſhe relented when ſhe found they were in earneſt.</hi> She doubtleſs could have given her huſband notice of what was deſigned, and ſo have prevented it, but ſhe did not; nor did ſhe make diſcovery of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:043485_0002_101D0B77A6D9FFC8"/>
it as ſoon as poſſible but ſent the next morning to a neighbour's to enquire after him, when at the ſame time ſhe knew he was in the well. She could not be brought to acknowledge her guilt or the juſtneſs of her ſentence till very late in the day, as ſhall be mentioned. It ſeems ſhe went upon this miſtaken principle that ſhe was not an immediate actor. She was a perſon of uncommon fortitude of mind, did not for the moſt part appear to be affected with many circumſtances in her caſe which were wont deeply to affect others. She would indeed ſometimes ſay, that ſhe felt more than ſhe did or could expreſs. Seldom a day paſſed but I viſited her, for which ſhe expreſſed great gratitude. I was wont to converſe with her upon the main point, and to endeavour to impreſs her mind with a ſenſe of her guilt, hoping to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve upon her the ſymptoms of true penitence. Appearances of this were from time to time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging.</p>
            <p>Her behaviour to all was very polite and complaiſant. From the frequent opportunities I had with her, I was led to conceive of her, as a perſon naturally of a kind, obliging, generous diſpoſition. But ſhe was unhappy, as above mentioned, in her firſt ſetting out in the world, and ſo left to a fatal capital crime.</p>
            <p>It appeared to many that carefully obſerv<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d her for many weeks before her execution, that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e was in a ſtate of pregnancy. She accordingly petitioned authority for a reſpite. A jury of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons was appointed to examine her. They did
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:043485_0003_101D0ACFEE1BB218"/>
not bring in in her favour; ſhe petitioned again but it was not granted; accordingly execution was ordered; ſhe received the tidings with great calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. At her own deſire, that the public might be ſatisfied, ſhe was opened the evening after the execution, and a perfect male <hi>foetus</hi> of the growth of five months, or near it, in the judgment of the operators, was taken from her. Having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone a ſecond examination a few days before her execution, and being thereby greatly diſordered, ſhe was not able to attend the ſermon that day.</p>
            <p>Soon after it, I went to the goal with a number of my brethren; ſhe appeared very calm, humble and penitent, profeſſed her faith in the great ſaviour and dependance upon him; upon its being propoſed to her, ſhe readily conſented to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; ſhe was ſo immediately, as but a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments remained before ſhe muſt go forth. The ſcene was very ſolemn and affecting; ſhe was not at all daunted when the ſheriff preſented her with and put on the fatal cord; ſhe told him ſhe eſteemed it as much as though he had put on a necklace of gold or diamonds. She preſently went forth, I accompanied her in a carriage to the place of execution; ſhe appeared undiſmayed and unaffrighted at the various ſtriking ſcenes that opened from one ſtage to another. At length we came in ſight of the gallows, I aſked her if the ſight of it did not ſtrike her? She anſwered not at all any more than any other object. Her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional politeneſs ſtill remained, and ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it to numbers that were near her. She
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:043485_0004_101D0B810B8F88A0"/>
preſently mounted the ſcaffold, and while the ſheriff was fixing her, ſhe told him, with a ſerene countenance, <hi>that it was the happieſt day ſhe ever ſaw, for ſhe doubted not it would be well with her.</hi> She acknowledged <hi>that ſhe juſtly died; that ſhe hoped to ſee her chriſtian friends ſhe left behind her, in Heaven, but that none of them might go there in the ignominious manner that ſhe did.</hi> It was a fixed principle with her, that confeſſion of her faults was proper only to be made to her maker, not to men; ſhe often declared, <hi>that ſhe was not neglectful of this and found ſatisfaction in ſo doing</hi>; but at the laſt caſt, ſhe did this at leaſt implicitly to the ſheriff, as juſt related.</p>
            <p>I would be far from preſuming to decide upon her future ſtate or that of the reſt of them.— I ſhall only add a ſhort extract from the ſermon I deliver'd to my people the Lord's-day following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"We know what are the infinite compaſſions of God, and that the blood of Jeſus is of infinite value, cleanſing from all unrighteouſneſs, We may by no means limit the holy one of Iſrael. We read of the ſervant that came in at the eleventh hour, who received the ſame wages as thoſe who had borne the burden and heat of the day. We know what was done by our Saviour to the penitent thief upon the croſs, juſt before he expired. This ſhows us what divine power and grace can do and may do. But ſecret things belong to God, and we ought to leave them with him."</hi>
