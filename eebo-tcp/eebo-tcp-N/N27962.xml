            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>The PETITION of DANA HYDE, and RUS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEL FITCH, of the County of Windham in said State,</head>
               <opener>Most Humbly Sheweth:</opener>
               <p>THAT it appears to your Petitioners, that SAMUEL STEARNS, Physician, and Doctor of Laws, presented a Petition to the Hon. the General ASSEMBLY of this State, at their Session at Windsor, in October last; exhibiting, that at a great expense, and with much care and attention, he had compiled sundry Medical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, which he intends to publish in two large Volumes in Folio, under the names of An AM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERICAN DISPENSATORY, and The CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LUMBIAN PRACTICE OF PHYSIC, and SYSTEM OF SURGERY; and praying that the Hon Jonathan Hunt, the Hon. John Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the Hon. Luke Knoulton, Gen. John Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aad, &amp; Josiah Arms. Esquires, might be empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered to raise by a LOTTERY, such a sum or sums of Money, as they might find necessary for the purpose of defraying the expense of Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Publishing the said Medical Productione,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:037255_0003_100C859A363C71F8"/>
that copies of them might be given gratis to the Physicians, Surgeons, Apothecaries and Students in Physic, for the immediate purpose of spreading medical knowledge in America.</p>
               <p>That sundry Physicians were appointed by both Houses to examine the work, who highly approved of the same; but on supposing a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lottery impracticable, recommended that a sum not exceeding two thousand Dollars should be granted to the Doctor, to encourage him in the prosecution and publication of the work.</p>
               <p>That to make way for the establishment of a Lottery, granted for the relief of a Lawyer's Son, the matter was postponed to the present Session, thro' the influence of several Gentlemen of the Bar, who pretended to doubt, whether the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions had been sufficiently examined or not.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioners find that said Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been sufficiently examined and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended before they were brought into this State, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ãâã</desc>
                  </gap> appears by the Certificates of Jared Potter, M. D. John Spaulding, Surgeon; Isaac Knight, M. D. and Doctor Daniel Gorden, all of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut; and of Seth Smith, Physician in Rhode-Island; and that a Medical Lottery upon a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral plan, had been recommended by more than fifty Gentlemen, containing some of the most respectable Characters on the Continent.</p>
               <p>That although your Petitioners esteem these Recommendations sufficient to satisfy all ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037255_0004_100C859BF1EF8608"/>
men, and that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations are needless as they can add no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it to the Work; yet, at the request of the Auth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, they have been perusing his productions, and find them well arranged and executed.</p>
               <p>That they, therefore, esteem it to be an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition for men not skilled in Medicine, to attempt to stop the progress of the publication of this Work<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> under the pretence of its not being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently examined.</p>
               <p>That it appears that these Productions are the first and only Systems of Pharmacy, Physic and Surgery, which have ever been compiled in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; and the Author informs<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> that he began the Work twenty-eight years ago; has travelled more than 23,000 miles, and spent upwards of 5,000 dollars in the prosecution of the same.</p>
               <p>That, as this Work contains an account of those things which have stood the test of Ages in the cure of Diseases, with the new medical Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and improvements collected from the different parts of the world; and as our old med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Books lead Students into error in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and expose the lives of the people, by misguiding Practitioners; the publication of these new Systems is a matter highly important to the Citizens of the United States.</p>
               <p>That it is to be regretted that this Work has not been published before; that for the want of publications, the new medical Discoveries have
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037255_0005_100CA06234FC4CF0"/>
been hidden from our Practitioners, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>ãâ¦ã</desc>
                  </gap> useless; while Congress, in a very laudable manner, have, by sums of money taken from the national Treasury, printed and dispersed their new Laws throughout the United States of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, for the purpose of promoting the increase of legal knowledge in this country<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>
               </p>
               <p>That so little attention has been paid to the cultivation and improvement of the Medical Art, when for the want of that light and information, which might easily be communicated by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the Public; our Practitioners have been groping in the dark, our citizens groaning with pain, and large sums of our money floating across the Atlantic for medical Books, when we might have enough of our own.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioners are sensible, that large numbers of the gentlemen of the faculty in this country, have had their learning to pay for after they began to practise, Horses and Medicine to provide, Lands to buy, Houses to build, Families to maintain, Taxes to pay, and large numbers of Poor People to visit, who are unable to make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that for these reasons, those Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are unable to pay for medical Books, and stand in as much need of assistance from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, as the Gentlemen of the Bar, and others did from the national Treasury.</p>
               <p>That from hence it is manifest, that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of these medical Systems by Subscription,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037255_0006_100CA063C5028050"/>
will by no means answer the great and good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of giving the new medical Discoveries and Improvements, a speedy and general spread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Gentlemen of the Faculty, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the United States of America.</p>
               <p>That your Petitioners apprehend, that this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant business might easily be accomplished by money raised by a Lottery, if Trustees were only vested with power to raise such sums as may be necessary; and that Books may be printed and dispersed throughout the United States, by mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey thus raised, with as much expedition, as by money taken out of a treasuryâthat as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense of carrying on this work, is at present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, they think that a limited Lottery may prove too small impede the progress of Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thus injure the Public.</p>
               <p>That they esteem a general Lottery, or one sufficient to defray the expense of compiling and publishing the productions already mentioned, PRACTICABLE, and have just reason to believe, that a Medical Lottery of this kind, would be greatly encouraged by the citizens of the United States in general, and that it would be no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but an honor and profit to this State.</p>
               <p>Therefore, that Medical Light and Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may no longer be shut out of this Country by poverty,</p>
               <p>Your Petitioners pray, that your Honors will be pleased to take these things into your serious

               <head>Doctor DUNCAN's Reasons why the Prayer of the foregoing Petition ought to be granted.</head>
               <p>THIS may Certify, that by reason of the new Discoveries and improvements in Chymistry and other branches of Medicine, made within a few years past, the virtues of the mineral, vegetable, &amp; animal productions of the universe, have been more fully ascertained; new remedies discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; new modes of composition invented; and new, cheaper, and more easy methods of cure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the practice of Physic, in places where these things have been but partly made known.</p>
               <p>That in consequence of these discoveries and improvements, the medical Books still used in this country are found to be too full of error; giving an erroneous account of the virtues of Medicines, and the genuine methods of curing Diseases; directing medicines injurious to the Human Body; infusing mistaken ideas into the minds of Students, and exposing the lives of the People, by misguiding Practitioners, when they attempt to heal the sick.</p>
               <p>That for the want of proper Publications, these new medical discoveries and improvements are principally unknown to the greatest part of our Practitioners, who grope in the dark for the want of information.</p>
               <p>That the only way to put the Theory and Practice of Physic upon a less dangerous and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037255_0010_100CA06E4CB2E290"/>
more profitable basis, is, to publish and spread amongst all the Gentlemen of the Faculty, a reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular system of Pharmacy, Physic, and Surgery, free from the errors recorded in our medical Books.</p>
               <p>That such Systems are already compiled by Doctor STEARNS; the work stands highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by those who have examined it; &amp; I have lately travelled in the Northern, Middle, and Southern States; but can hear of no other person who has ever attempted to compile such Productions in America; and although they are much wanted; yet, they have been suffered to lie useless for the want of proper encouragement, to the great damage of the community, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to the country.</p>
               <p>That the inability of the Gentlemen of the Faculty, to pay for such productions, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of publishing them by money raised by a Lottery, is fully set forth in the preceding Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orial of DANA HYDE, and RUSSEL FITCH, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons to Col. STEWARD'S Regiment. But it ought, however, to be added, that it is said, that Congress never have, nor do ever incline to grant any kind of a Lottery under the present Constitution; &amp; that one cannot be obtained, without applying to a General Assembly, who can easily grant one that may be sufficient.</p>
               <p>That it appears, when the census was taken, that the inhabitants of the Northwestern Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037255_0011_100CA070B59AF620"/>
were conjectured to be 5,000, and those of Vermont, 85,000; and yet the Legislature of the former have granted a Lottery of 400,000 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, in order to open a Canal; and it is my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that the General Assembly of Vermont, can just as easily grant one sufficient to defray the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense of Compiling and Publishing a System of Pharmacy, Physic, and Surgery, if they may see fit, and that a general Lottery is PRACTICABLE, notwithstanding the sentiments of a few who have been otherwise minded,</p>
               <p>Who can suppose that one fiftieth part of the tickets in the Lottery abovementioned, will ever be sold in the Northwestern Territory?âAnd who can suppose that one twentieth part of the tickets in a Medical Lottery, would ever be sold in Vermont?</p>
               <p>Such Lotteries then, must draw money from other States, and enrich those that grant them.</p>
               <p>That a Medical Lottery is more necessary and important than any ever granted in America; and I cannot see how such a scheme can prove injurious to this State, inasmuch, as the gentlemen nominated as Trustees, are all men of honor and of property, and it cannot be supposed, that they would suffer the State or any individual to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. It therefore appears to me, that it would be both an honor and profit to this State, that it would draw money into it from distant Parts; produce a great revolution in the Theory and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037255_0012_100CA072A6865DA0"/>
Practice of Physic; raise the medical Art to a higher degree of perfection, and immortalize the name of our General Assembly.</p>
               <p>That as some who have not duly considered of this matter, may admire why these productions are not published by subscription; I shall take the freedom to mention, that, that is a very slow way of spreading medical Knowledge; and that I have just reason to believe, that more may be done in this way in five years by a Lottery, than in a hundred by Subscription; for Doctor RUSH wrote upon-twenty seven diseases; published his first volume eleven years ago; and I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that but very few of the Physicians have ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er seen it in the northern States. That Doctor BARTRAM of Philadelphia, published an excellent Treatise upon Botany, seven years ago, and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learn that it has ever been seen in Vermont.</p>
               <p>That the inability of the Gentlemen of the Faculty to pay for such productions, prevents their circulation. Dr. STEARNS, has written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more than 1387 Diseases, all the different ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in Surgery, and all the various subjects appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of in the Apothecaries' Art; and should he attempt to publish his Productions by Subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I apprehend they would not be sufficiently spread in a century.</p>
               <p>Now who amongst the Gentlemen of the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulty have ever been enlightened by the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr Rush's and Bartram's useful produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037255_0013_100CA07431EB30A8"/>
in places where their Books have not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared? And who can be illuminated by the promulgation of Dr. STEARNS'S Systems, in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they never will be seen, unless general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spread?</p>
               <p>If they are published by subscription, but a part of our Practitioners will be enlightened; others will remain in darkness, administering im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper remedies, and be ignorantly destroying the lives of men, women and children. Indeed, it is as presumptuous to suffer our physicians, to practice without being acquainted with the new discoveries, as it would be to send men into battle without military skill, arms, or ammunition. It is therefore highly important, that these discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be spread amongst all the Gentlemen of the Faculty.</p>
               <p>Our national Legislature, on being sensible that their Laws could not be sufficiently spread without the assistance of the Public, passed an Act, dated March 3d, 1795, and another two years since; ordaining that 5,000 Setts of the Laws of the United States, should be printed, &amp; dispersed as follows, viz. 4,500 Setts among the people, in proportion to the number of Federal Representatives sent from each State; and the remainder amongst the members of Congress, the Supreme and District Judges, Marshals, Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and other officers of government. It has been said, those setts contained 15,000 volumes;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037255_0014_100CA0781848D3D0"/>
and that the whole expense was defrayed by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney taken out of the National Treasury.</p>
               <p>That I esteem this to be a very laudable trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acton of Congress; for their laws could not be obeyed nor executed unless they were known; any more than New Medical Discoveries and Improvements can regulate the practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians, or prove serviceable to the community whilst they remain unknown.</p>
               <p>That in like manner medical Books may be printed and spread amongst the Gentlemen of the Faculy, throughout the United States of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and with as much expedition, by money rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a Lottery, as by that taken from a nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Treasury. This method would furnish all our Physicians, Surgeons, Apothecaries and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Physic, with regular systems to guide them in all the difficult and dangerous cases, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and processes they may have to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And this may undoubtedly be done with less than one fourth part of the expense of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing medical Libraries in Europe, which are intermixed with error, and not furnished with an account of the new discoveries which have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been published.</p>
               <p>That as the medical Art, is the most benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial of all the Arts that ever the ALMIGHTY suffered to be known and practised among the Children of Men, the cultivation and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it ought to be encouraged by all who
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037255_0015_100CA07A5F48B290"/>
wish to promote the Health and happiness of mankind; and he must be very inhumane who attempts to discourage this important work.</p>
               <p>But is it not admirable! that so little has been done towards encouraging, cultivating and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving this useful Art in America? That 193 years have revolved since it was first settled by the Europeans, and no regular System of Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, Physic and Surgery has ever been publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and spread amongst our Practitioners at the expense of the Public?</p>
               <p>That an almost innumerable number of new Medical Discoveries and improvements have been suffered to lie useless, whilst swarms of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learnt impostors have been suffered to rush into the practice of Physic, without Books, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the necessary qualifications, when the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Health and prolongation of Life, so es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially depends upon our Practitioners being duly qualified.</p>
               <p>That the benefits that would naturally result from the spreading of Medical Systems amongst the Gentlemen of the Faculty, by money raised by a Lottery, prudently managed, and drawn in different Classes would be almost beyond descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:â For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It would induce the rich to help those indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Practitioners and Students, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to furnish themselves with Medical Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:037255_0016_100CA07C89D08320"/>2. It would lay a proper foundation for the rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of regular bred Physicians, Surgeons, and Apothecaries amongst ourselves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It would lay open the virtues of the Produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our own Country, so far as they are known: and bring them more and more into use amongst our Practitioners.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It would lessen the importation of Drugs, and of Books; and save vast sums of money from being exported out of our Country.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It would raise the method of compounding Medicines, to a much higher degree of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and make them more beneficial to the distressed,</p>
               <p n="6">6. It would make the cure of Diseases more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, and the practice of Physic less expensive. And,</p>
               <p n="7">7. It would greatly increase the Riches, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Health and Happiness of the People.</p>
               <p>That from what has been said, I trust it will appear to every one who duly considers of the matter, that a General Lottery is both practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and absolutely necessary; and that it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly important, that the Prayer of the preceding Petitioners should be granted.</p>
