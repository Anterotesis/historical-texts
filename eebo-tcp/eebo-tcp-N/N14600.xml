            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>HAVING attained the main object of our wiſhes, by a ſucceſsful termination of the war, we muſt now bend our thoughts to ſecure the bleſſings of peace. We have eſtabliſhed our independence, and mankind have viewed our exploits with aſtoniſhment; but, to realiſe thoſe flattering proſpects which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves, when we "took our rank among nations," will require more wiſdom and political virtue, than have been manifeſted ſince the earlieſt periods of the conteſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theſe United States have diſcovered an unhappy jealouſy of congreſs, and of each other; the acts of almoſt every legiſlature have uniformly tended to diſguſt its citizens, and to annihilate its credit; and the natural conſequence is a want of confidence between men, a profligacy of morals, and a drooping, diſreputable, ruinous commerce. If I thought it impoſſible to remedy theſe evils, and to obviate impending calamities, I ſhould pant for a favourable opportunity to abandon a country, which, at preſent, ſeems to enjoy the greateſt degree of liberty, that is conſiſtent with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and government; but which nothing leſs than an almoſt entire change of meaſures can preſerve from a miſerable tyranny of one kind or another. I rejoice, that I am not ſingular in theſe obſervations. A general apprehenſion of danger may lead to ſecurity, as every man who perceives it, and conſiders the happineſs of his country as connected with his own, will think himſelf bound to do every thing in his power to ſecure it. I ſhould think myſelf deficient in every part of my duty, if I did not, on this intereſting occaſion, exert my poor abilities to the utmoſt. Matters of more general concern, and thoſe, which
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:018517_0004_0FA7AE4A514C7F50"/>particularly reſpect other ſtates, I ſhall leave to abler pens, and to thoſe, who are poſſeſſed of better means of information. My purpoſe is to point out ſome of the moſt material errors of our own government, and to propoſe ſuch meaſures, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive neceſſary to revive public credit, to eſtabliſh a fair na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character, and to render government firm, reſpectable, and happy. In the proſecution of ſuch a deſign, it will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult not to offend, unleſs it ſhould pleaſe Heaven to eradicate from the hearts of men every little ſelfiſh, groveling paſſion, and, in the room thereof, to implant candour, truth, and patriotiſm. I muſt however previouſly declare, that my breaſt harbours no reſentment againſt any man, and if in yielding to the ſtrong impulſe of an honeſt zeal, I ſhould do no more than confirm, or increaſe the number of, my enemies, the reflection will be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying indeed! but I have that within me, which never failed to adminiſter ſome conſolation in the moſt vexatious occurrences of my life.</p>

            <head>POLITICAL SCHEMES AND CALCULATIONS.</head>
            <p>AT the laſt ſeſſion of the general aſſembly, a committee was appointed by the houſe of delegates, to prepare a bill for the relief of public creditors. The intention of the movers for that bill was to eſtabliſh an equitable rule of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count between the ſtate and its debtors. By particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, the author of theſe ſheets undertook to frame a bill, which went ſomewhat further than their firſt ideas on the ſubject; it was handed about among the members of each houſe, and became a conſiderable topic of converſation out of doors; but neither that bill nor any other was brought in by the committee, and only ineffectual attempts were made to do the buſineſs partially by reſolves. The unfortunate bill was either loſt or ſuppreſſed. I have recollected the heads, and now offer them to the public with ſome improvements, which have ſuggeſted themſelves ſince the ſeſſion, and with ſuch alterations as have become neceſſary by the lapſe of time.</p>

            <p>I HAVE thus endeavoured to delineate an eaſy and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple plan, for reducing our affairs to order and regularity, on terms the moſt truly advantageous to the ſtate; for giving its creditors of every deſcription the beſt ſatisfaction in our power, without impoſing new burthens on the people, and, at the ſame time, for affording a reaſonable relief to a variety of diſtreſſed public debtors. As the reaſons, on which it is
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018517_0008_0FA7AE51D50F1918"/>grounded, may not be obvious to every one, I ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſeries of explanatory remarks, and conſider every objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that has been or may be offered to the ſcheme.</p>
            <p>By a conſolidation of funds, we avoid much trouble, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and confuſion. But there is a much more ſubſtantial reaſon. The funds appropriated to the redemption of red money are at leaſt twelve times more than ſufficient; for ſome certificates there are funds appointed which are by no means adequate, and for the reſt there are no funds at all. Let us attend to what was done by a nation, which has not always betrayed a want of political wiſdom, in a caſe ſomewhat ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to this. The produces of the taxes in Great-Britain, not long ago, conſtituted each a diſtinct fund, for the payment of the ſums advanced on each ſeveral tax; it was thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to unice and blend them together, and to ſuperadd the faith of parliament, for the general ſecurity of the whole. Some of theſe ſeveral funds were more than ſufficient, others were inadequate, and the aggregate fund, formed from their union, might not perhaps have been an ample ſecurity for all the ſums advanced on the ſeveral taxes. This meaſure, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, excit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d little clamour, and gave no ſhock to public cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; becauſe it was provided, that no injury ſhould thereby be done to creditors; becauſe the public faith had, for a long time, been inviolate; and becauſe the people repoſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in government.</p>
            <p n="1">1. But the principal objection to the propoſed plan of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidation is, that we ſhall violate our faith, and excite cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and diſcontent, by taking from the poſſeſſors of bills of credit the ample ſecurity they now have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have ever been a warm advocate for public faith, and it pleaſes me to obſerve gentlemen, who have not always paid it a decent regard, at length become ſenſible of its value; they may reſt aſſured, that my principles are unchanged, and I congratulate them on the happy alteration in theirs; my grand aim is to reſtore public credit, and regain the confidence of the people. I am convinced, he that will give himſelf the trouble to examine the ſtate of our affairs, and conſider, without prejudice, my plan in all its parts, will perceive, that it can have no other tendency. The objection, which appears formidable at firſt ſight, will vaniſh, when we come cloſely to view the ſubject. The bills of credit have ceaſed to circulate; they are no longer a medium of commerce; they are merely an object of ſpeculation; and the holders of them are actuated by views, very different from that of laying them by until the period of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018517_0009_0FA7AE5270CA5B40"/>their redemption; they have obtained them, for the purpoſe of diſcharging debts to the ſtate, or of ſelling them to public debtors. If they obtained them for the firſt purpoſe, they are not at all affected, if we even take away all the funds, provided we conſent to receive them at par. If for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, they are not affected, provided we create the demand they had in view, and which would ſtamp a value on their paper, if no funds had ever been aſſigned for its redemption. That it has been purchaſed or kept up, for one or the other of theſe purpoſes, may be inferred from the ſuperior advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſuch a ſpeculation, which every body at this time of day is acquainted with, and from ſeveral other circumſtances. Some time ago, there was a conſiderable ſum of the red bills in the hands of the people; a reſolve paſſed the legiſlature for receiving them at par; the holders immediately brought them to the treaſury, or ſold them to the purchaſers of the property pledged for their redemption; and not more than £. 14,000 remain in the hands of the people. There was very little immediate uſe for the black, or the continental ſtate bills; they had, notwithſtanding, attained a value not far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to that of ſpecie. Is it poſſible, that any circumſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the funds, two or three years after their emiſſion, and as many before the period of calling them in by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, ſhould give them a value ſix times greater than they bore ſoon after they were iſſued? A perſon, who has the leaſt tincture of this kind of ſcience, will anſwer in the negative; he will tell you, that the general expectation of their being received by the treaſurer at par, created a demand, and raiſed them to a greater value than the mere conſideration of funds could have poſſibly conferred; <hi>that where bil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s of credit are not equal to ſpecie, by the force of opinion, and there is no immediate demand to make them ſo, and, at the ſame time, there is no diſtruſt of the funds, or of the public faith, their value can be fixed on no other principle, than that of calculating the preſent worth of a ſum of money payable at a future day.</hi> Whenever they attain a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue conſiderably ſuperior to this, it muſt be owing to ſome immediate or expected uſe. In the caſe of theſe bills, it has been generally expected, that the ſtate muſt receive them from its debtors as ſpecie; take away this expectation, and the proprietors of the bills will be materially affected; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it, and they will care nothing about the funds. It is ridiculous to imagine, when a man can get £. 100 ſpecie for £. 106 paper, and when money can command from ten to 20 or 30 per cent. intereſt, that he will prefer the board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018517_0010_0FA7AE533B62FCD8"/>his paper, and run the hazard of ſpecie's not being ready at the treaſury, at the time for exchanging it. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there is every reaſon to conclude, if my propoſitions meet with ſucceſs, that a very inconſiderable ſum will be left, to redeem with gold and ſilver. My plan provides for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a ſufficient quantity of ſpecie for the purpoſe. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the different periods for redeeming the bills of credit are remote; one will arrive in June 1785, another in May 1786, and the laſt in January 1787. We have abundant leiſure to make the experiment, and the legiſlature may hereafter make a further proviſion, if, contrary to every reaſonable calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a further proviſion ſhould be found requiſite. I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that by placing all government ſocurities on the ſame footing, the value of bills of credit will, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, be inferior to what it has lately been; but by the natural operation of the plan, in a ſhort time, every ſpecies of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as my eſtimates ſhall hereafter tend to demonſtrate, will attain a value very little inferior to ſpecie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. An objection has been thrown out, and will probably be urged, with all the powers of eloquence, againſt any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſales of confiſcated property. "In purſuance of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in the definitive treaty, congreſs has earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended a reſtitution of all this property; and our national honour is deeply concerned in adopting this wiſe, humane, equitable recommendation." The words of it, which (by the bye) are faithfully copied from the treaty, leave ſome doubt reſpecting the meaning of the term reſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If it means more than a reaſonable compenſation, we muſt alter our laws, before we can comply; becauſe no alien is capable of holding lands in this ſtate, until he becomes a citizen, under the act for naturalization. A real Britiſh ſubject is as much an alien, to all intents and purpoſes, as a Turk, or a Chineſe. This is well known to every perſon acquainted with the common law of England, and the conſtitution of this ſtate, that law, with reſpect to aliens, containing the only rule known to Maryland. By taking the oath, and making the declaration preſcribed by the act for naturaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an alien may indeed acquire a capacity of holding lands; but then he no longer muſt conſider himſelf a ſubject to Great-Britain; becauſe he thereby abjures all allegiance to any government, but the ſtate of Maryland. It cannot be conceived, that Great-Britain, in taking care of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of her ſubjects, ſhould make ſuch a proviſion, as would, in all probability, oblige them to become citizens of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018517_0011_0FA7AE57034451A8"/>America. She could not imagine, that America, contrary to the policy of all nations, would permit aliens to hold real property. Should we incline to adopt the recommendation, my idea is this; the remaining confiſcated property muſt be placed on the ſame footing with that already ſold, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſtored; we muſt diſpoſe of it to the beſt advantage, and then find out ſome good and ſubſtantial fund for making a compenſation to every ſufferer, without giving any one claimant a preference to another. I would ever proteſt againſt throwing the moſt valuable property of the ſtate into this fund; we have much better uſes for it. The meaſure of confiſcation had always my hearty approbation. I conſidered it as founded on natural juſtice, upon policy, and upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as every intelligent impartial perſon may be convinced, by peruſing the long controverſy between the two branches of the legiſlature, Nothing has yet turned up to alter the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, and Great-Britain has referred the cauſe of her unfortunate ſubjects and adherents entirely to our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity. I can commiſerate the caſe of individuals, reduced to deplorable circumſtances, by the ambition and crime of their nation; but I cannot admire acts of generoſity, unleſs that virtue be diſplayed, without making a ſacrifice of much more important ones. When we ſhall have done bare juſtice to the men, whoſe dangers, toils and ſufferings, have ſecured our independence; when we ſhall have made compenſation to our own people, who have ſuffered by the ravages of the enemy; when we ſhall have made proviſion for complying with our engagements to our other friends; when we ſhall have rendered government firm, reſpectable and happy; it will be time to purſue the dictates of a generous, humane, merciful ſpirit. But, gracious Heaven! what are the men, for whoſe ſakes we ſhould lay burthens on our murmuring, diſcontented, injured citizens, and withhold juſtice from our benefactors? Is it for parricides, for enemies, for pretended friends, or at beſt men, who have viewed our ſtruggles with a cold indifference, that we are to do all this? It is by no means impoſſible, that a good citizen of theſe ſtates may pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, forgive, admire, or love ſome of the perſons, who fall under this deſcription; he may aſſociate with them; if they are indigent, he may aſſiſt them with his private fortune; but he will never wiſh to ſacrifice for them the intereſts of his country, or the dear bought rights of his fellow-citizens; it is unneceſſary to ſay more than, that all the world, at leaſt Great-Britain, fully comprehends what is meant by, what
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018517_0012_0FA7AE5864C92128"/>will, and what ought to be, the effect of this ſtipulated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation.</p>
            <p>I have propoſed an early ſale of confiſcated property for two reaſons. The money to ariſe from it, whether the plan be adopted or not, is immediately wanted; and it is evident, that ſuch a ſale would be moſt productive. It would anſwer little purpoſe to demonſtrate, how much the intereſt of the ſtate has ſuffered by not ſelling this property, ſome time ago, for every kind of government paper. I am unwilling to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, at this time, to whom this bad policy is juſtly to be imputed; I will make the moſt favourable conſtruction, that it proceeded from a defect of judgment. Had this meaſure taken place eighteen months ago, the intereſts of the army, as well as thoſe of the ſtate, would have been much better taken care of; and ſpeculation, that bane to commerce, and perhaps to morals, would have been almoſt at an end. A blind reſentment againſt ſpeculators has prevented many ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary meaſures, and produced effects directly oppoſite to thoſe intended. A judicious candid ſpeculator will, at once, ridicule the policy, ſhew what advantages it has given him, and how much it has injured the ſtate, and its ſoldiers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I come now to conſider another grand objection to my bill. "It does not diſtinguiſh between depreciation certificates in the hands of the grantees, and thoſe which have been, for a trifling conſideration, transferred to ſpeculators." It would perhaps be extremely difficult to aſcertain what certificates have been transferred, and what not, a very little ingenuity having already defeated other ſchemes of diſcrimination. Whether this objection ought to have any weight depends on the ſoundneſs or futility of the arguments adduced in favour of a diſcrimination; ſince the acts, under which theſe certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficates were iſſued, held out no ſuch idea. They entitle the party to receive a certain ſum of money, and are either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly, or by the ſtrongeſt implication, allowed to be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, although under certain idle reſtrictions. Had not the law provided theſe reſtrictions, an aſſignment would have given an equitable claim, and placed the aſſignee on the ſame footing with the ſoldier, to whom the certificate was granted. By obſerving them, an aſſignment has the ſanction of the legiſlature, and we cannot, without a glaring violation of one faith, create any diſtinction among the proprietors of the certificates, whether aſſignees, or original grantees. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very act, tending to inſpire a diſtruſt of the laws, muſt have pernicious conſequences, as it weakens government, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018517_0013_0FA7AE59DEAEA8F8"/>leſſons private credit. In this view, a diſcrimination would be impolitic; that it would be illegal, arbitrary, unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and unjuſt, there needs little further argument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
            <p>It is contended, that theſe aſſignments ſhould be declared void by the aſſembly, and juſtice done to the army. Let it be indelibly impreſſed on the mind of every man, who wiſhes to diſcover the true principles of government, that the public has no right to meddle with the contracts of individuals, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs made in violation of a ſubſiſting law; when that is the caſe, it is not the province of the legiſlature to determine; it belongs only to the tribunals of law and equity. I believe, no inſtance can be ſhewn, where the legiſlature, in a well regulated free government, has exerciſed the power, except in matters of grand national concern, upon the fulleſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of fraud and deluſion, and where the courts of juſtice were deemed incompetent. Does the caſe of transferred cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, in any reſpect, reſemble the infamous South-ſea ſcheme? Is it an affair that intereſts the community? Has there been any cheat or deception? Or, if there has, are our courts of juſtice incompetent? Whether the meaſures of the Britiſh parliament on the memorable occaſion juſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were not too great an infringement of the principles of their conſtitution, is ſomewhat problematical. However, the conſtitution of Maryland in this reſpect is more accurately defined; the ſpirit of it every where, and, in ſome parts, the letter, is pointedly againſt retroſpective laws; it intended to eſtabliſh a firm and perpetual barrier between the legiſlative and judicial departments, and he that propoſes to break it down, ſhould do it to effect ſome very ſalutary purpoſe, which at preſent I cannot diſcover.</p>
            <p>I have heard of ſome men, hardy enough to declare, that transferred certificates ought not to be redeemed at all, or only at the price they coſt the purchaſer. Their method of delivering the ſtate from a great part of its debt would indeed be more cheap and compendious than mine, which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to pay it; the very ſuppoſition of getting rid of it otherwiſe ſhould excite a general indignation. If an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhould be found weak enough to frame a reſolve for ſo baſe a purpoſe, it would in the end be reſcinded; the injured parties, having the conſtitution, the law, and equity, on their fides, would never ceaſe to remonſtrate; indeed a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent legiſlature would wait for no ſolicitation; it would make all convenient haſte to call in the certificates, not on
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018517_0014_0FA7AE59F2A2FF58"/>account of juſtice only, but becauſe, ſo long as they exiſt, the ſtate is burthened with intereſt, and leaves them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> object of ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>Let us for a moment ſuppoſe the legiſlature might diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate without doing wrong, and that it might, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, undertake to determine what is juſtice between all parties; ſtate, ſoldier, and ſpeculator. Let us ſuppoſe it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating with temper on the mode of relieving the poor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, who, for a ſmall pittance, has renounced the hard price of his toils and ſuffering Shall the ſtate make him a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from the public treaſury? I believe few members would hazard a propoſition, that would open ten thouſand mouths againſt them. No man within my knowledge has dropped the moſt diſtant hint of ſuch a meaſure; but many have declared, that the ſpeculator ought to be compelled to do juſtice; that the fair way is to pay him, with intereſt, the money he advanced, and let the ſoldier have the reſidue; that is, the ſtate ſhall owe him ſo much, and be indebted to the ſoldier for the balance; the contract, however fairly made, is to be annulled; the purchaſer is to find himſelf duped by a ſolemn act of the legiſlature; he is ſtripped of his rights, "without a trial by jury," and without a pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting "law of the land." Theſe are ſerious conſiderations with me; but I have obſerved them to have little weight with others. Let us then enquire, how far this egregious ſcheme is practicable; on which of the parties will the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature lay the burthen of proving the conſideration of the ſale? Muſt indifferent teſtimony be required? That we know to be impoſſible, becauſe in nine caſes out of ten, there is no witneſs, or writing, by which it can be aſcertained. Shall we admit the oath of the purchaſer? It is very probable, if he has dealt a good deal in this way, that, in two caſes out of three, he has no memorandum, or recollection of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe ſum, or thing, he gave; beſides, we ſhould expoſe him to a ſtrong temptation to commit a perjury, which he might conſtrue a pious fraud to ſecure a remnant of his rights. Shall we truſt to the oath of the ſoldier? If he can be ſo loſt to the ſentiments of honour, as to take advantage of the law, it cannot be conceived he will entertain a proper ſenſe of the obligation of an oath. Many certificates have paſſed through a variety of hands. Suppoſe a man has purchaſed at ſix for one, and ſold to another at four, who has ſold at three; how ſhall we contrive to aſcertain all theſe contracts, and do what may be called juſtice to all the parties? The ſoldier or the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018517_0015_0FA7AE5AB1C545A0"/>purchaſer may have died, or left the ſtate; ſome ſoldiers will reject the relief, and theſe are the only men who are likely to become good citizens; others will accept it, and theſe are the men who diſſipate every thing in riot, and will hereafter prove the bane of ſociety. In ſhort, this project of diſpenſing juſtice to the army will be found, on the ſtricteſt enquiry, to be unjuſt, impracticable, viſionary, and abſurd.</p>
            <p>Let us now, with that candour and impartiality which is due to all men, examine what has induced ſo many humane well diſpoſed perſons to advocate a ſcheme, on which the idea of a diſcrimination between our creditors has been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They have conceived, that ſpeculators availed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the neceſſities of the ſoldiers, when they obtained certificates, at a price ſo far inferior to the ſum expreſſed. But what was the cauſe of this? and where does the blame properly lie? The circumſtances, under which the certificates were iſſued, are well known. Congreſs had recommended this meaſure to the ſtates, as the only expedient that remained for keeping the army on foot. But this ſalutary purpoſe would not have been effected; the clamours of the army would not have been appeaſed; the ſpirit of mutiny and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion would not have ſubſided; if the poor naked ſoldier could not have exchanged his paper for ſomething, to ſupply his immediate wants. What was there, in the name of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, to ſtamp a proper value upon it? That patriotiſm alone would be a ſufficient motive for monied or trading men to purchaſe it at par, was a mere Utopian dream; the project which is founded only on the ſuppoſition, that public ſpirit is to ſuperſede the dictates of private intereſt, deſerves not a ſerious examination. There were no certain funds, or period fixed for the redemption of this paper; there was no imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate uſe, and the mode of aſſignment was rendered difficult and precarious; it was, notwithſtanding, at firſt exchanged at par for the bills of credit then in circulation, which were limited in their duration, and had certain funds for their ſupport. I would aſk any cool rational man, what better could have been expected? The aſſembly, however, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this traffic as a ſhameful impoſition on a meritorious claſs of men, whom Providence had not bleſſed with diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to manage their own concerns; it determined, contrary to its own recent poſitive engagement, that certificates alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy transferred ſhould not be received for certain lands, that were directed to be ſold, for the expreſs purpoſe of redeeming army certificates; and, by way of juſtifying its conduct, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018517_0016_0FA7AE5B6F637C28"/>opprobrious epithet was applied to a ſet of men, who had long before been the objects of an undiſtinguiſhing popular reſentment. This mode of procedure produced little benefit to the ſoldier; his neceſſities ſtill obliged him to ſell; and the legiſlature had not deprived him of his power. If, under all theſe diſcouragements, a ſpeculator would hazard the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, it is not to be wondered, that he afforded no better terms. In every other contract, he might avail himſelf of the advantages of his ready money, his ſuperior judgment, and of other peoples wants. Very little conſure has fallen on thoſe honourable gentlemen, who, at the race of two for one, obtained red money, which was inſtantly to be received from them at par for their taxes. I aver, that many reſpectable members of the legiſlature purchaſed red money at that cruel rate from indigent perſons, who had juſt received it as ſpeci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> from the ſtate. Where is the enthuſiaſtic lover of juſtice, that will propoſe a relief in this caſe? And yet if there is a difference between this caſe, and that of transferred certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, it is by no means in favour of the latter. In both caſes, the ſufferer muſt look to the aſſembly for the authors of their wrongs. But alas! their own acts have put a redreſs entirely out of the queſtion; the ſtate cannot make up their loſſes, and pay their aſſignees the full ſum beſides.</p>
            <p>Of all the numerous objectors to my bill, thoſe who talk moſt colourably on the ſubject, have argued in this manner; "It is our fixed determination to preſerve public faith, and to pay our creditors of every deſcription. It is folly to talk of doing otherwiſe; but, if we cannot ſatisfy them all at once, ought we for that reaſon to pay none at all? The path is plain; we will pay as far as we can, and give the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, where it is juſtly due." With all proper reſpect for high names and ſuperior talents, theſe gentlemen are miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken both in principle and fact I cannot perceive, how the officers or ſoldiers who have retained their certificates have any juſt claim to a diſtinction. (They will pardon me for the exerciſe of a right, for which I will ever acknowledge myſelf pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>cipally indebted to them.) They have never been injured by the act of thoſe, who have transferred; why then are they to be placed in a better ſituation than if not a ſingle certificate had been aſſigned? If we had a ſum of money in the treaſury <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> argue in this way: We are indebted to a variety of creditors, and to a very large amount; we have a variety of debtors, although to not an equal amount; ſome of theſe debtors are become creditors, by having purchaſed the government ſecurities granted to others; ſome of theſe ſecurities have been aſſigned to perſons not indebted to the ſtate. Shall we admit the plain, convenient, equitable rule of diſcount, which prevails between individuals? Or ſhall we harraſs and ruin a debtor, by compelling him to make full payment, whilſt he has a liquidated claim, which would more than balance his debt? Shall we make ſale of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and the property of his ſecurities? Shall we commit his body to a gaol, and at the ſame time defer our payment to him, juſt as long as we pleaſe? Again. Shall we at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per period, aſſign our debts to our creditors, and thereby gratify both debtors and creditors! Or ſhall we be at the riſk, trouble, and expence, of collecting from the former, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſatisfy ſome of the latter? The whole appears ſo plain to my underſtanding, that if I had not heard oppoſite opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, moſt pertinaciouſly maintained, I ſhould be aſhamed to offer a ſerious argument. I ſhould expect the ſame fate with a preacher, who takes his text, divides and ſubdivides his argument, fatigues himſelf and his audience, and makes a mighty pother to demonſtrate what no man in his ſenſes could poſſibly deny.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing ſtill that the debts due to the ſtate, together with the money lying idle in the treaſury, and the remaining confiſcated property, are unequal to what ſhe owes, why are we to reject the equitable rule of diſcount? <hi>(I will not aſk, whether it is in our power to reject it.)</hi> Does juſtice between the ſtate and a citizen differ from juſtice between one citizen and another? If we mean to pay our debts at all, why may we not ſet about it at once in a way, which will produce no inconvenience to the people? Why may we not, as far as poſſible, deliver our affairs from embarraſſment, perplexity, riſk, and confuſion? What valuable end is propoſed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay? It would appear to be the ſtudy of ſome politicans, to vex and diſquiet every body, that has any dealings with the public. It may anſwer ſome private contracted view; they
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018517_0018_0FA7AE5FEBC29F18"/>may for a ſhort ſeaſon enjoy their beloved popularity; the people, who are ſeldom acquainted with the true ſituation of affairs, being told, that the general eaſe and advantage has been conſulted, may at firſt hail them as guardians and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours; but when they diſcover the deception; when they perceive, that a trifling eaſe cannot be obtained, without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing the rights of their fellow-citizens, and of their real ſaviours and benefactors; when they come to experience the evils of a weak and corrupt government; when they have the proſpect of ſtill greater before them; they muſt be ſenſeleſs and depraved indeed, if they do not execrate the authors of their calamities; they will at length perceive, that virtue is the true baſis of all free government, and that a republic, which is falſe to its own people, and does not watch over the happineſs, and guard the rights of all, will ſoon loſe every thing but the name, and at laſt degenerate into deſpotiſm, or ſome other worſe ſpecies of tyranny.</p>
            <p>To demonſtrate how far my plan is likely to produce every end I propoſed, it is time to produce my eſtimates, which, though not perfectly exact in every particular, were very near the truth on the 14th of February laſt, when I received my information from the treaſurer and the auditor, and one of the commiſſioners, after a careful examination of their books; whatever change has ſince taken place, is immaterial; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no part of the funds can have been diminiſhed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out alſo diminiſhing the debt, or providing ſo much ſpecie; and no article of the debts can be augmented, without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the article of unliquidated debts, which with me muſt remain a matter of conjecture, for which I have made a large allowance, but which, there is every reaſon to believe, cannot be ſo great as has been repreſented.</p>

            <p>N. B. Theſe are eſtimates of the funds and debts as they ſtood on the 14th of February; the change which has ſince taken place, as I ſaid before, is immaterial. I have not reckoned on the bank ſtock, which would make a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to our funds, about £.40,000 ſterling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:018517_0021_0FA7AE63C7A1FEA8"/>
To ſave myſelf, and the gentlemen to whom I am indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for information, a great deal of unneceſſary trouble, I have made only ſuppoſitions with reſpect to intereſt, taking care, that the balance in favour of the ſtate ſhould not exceed the truth. That balance may ſtand againſt unforeſeen loſſes and deductions from the funds, which I have ſuppoſed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient only to diſcharge the debts contained in my eſtimate; in leſs than three years my plan, if adopted, will have had its full operation, and the ſurplus, if any, will again be at the diſpoſal of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>The certificates given by virtue of the act propoſing to the citizens of this ſtate, &amp;c. amount to £.92,033 12 0. As we have undertaken to provide for the punctual payment of the intereſt of money lent to congreſs, and as congreſs is thereby releaſed from the burthen, they will certainly permit us to deduct it from our quota of the intereſt of the national debt. Should they refuſe ſo reaſonable a propoſition, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate politician might move for referring this laſt of creditors to their original ſecurities. Great inconveniencies would reſult from the meaſure; and I do not believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs would ſubject us to ſo diſagreeable a neceſſity. That prudent body has always conſulted the welfare of the men, who generouſly lent them money to proſecute the war, or who placed any reliance on the public faith. Beſides, they would conſider, that our miſtake proceeded from an earneſt deſire of complying with their juſt requiſitions. Should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs view the matter in a different light; ſhould they tell us no deduction can be made; we can only contribute our full quota, pay the intereſt on theſe certificates, and carry to the continental treaſurer the original loan-office certificates, which now belong to us, and entitle the bearer to the ſum expreſſed, and receive juſt the ſame intereſt from him. Take it either way, and we are not burthened, in the end, more than if we had not officiouſly taken the place of congreſs. Every wiſe man would indeed prefer a fair honeſt diſcount to a vexatious circuity of payment.</p>
            <p>I have been amuſed at the trouble, ſome gentlemen have given themſelves, to ſwell the ſtate debt to a ſum truly formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. To expoſe a moſt egregious impoſition, I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the nature of certain debts, ſet down in their eſtimates, which I have not admitted into min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is ſaid, "we have never fully complied with the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of congreſs, and we ſhall be indebted about £.400,000 on that ſcore. We owe for the pay of our line in the year
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018517_0022_0FA7AE64838031C8"/>1782 about £.200,000. Only a ſmall part of our quota of the continental bills of credit has been called in, and as we are, agreeably to a reſolve of congreſs, to redeem them at forty for one, we are indebted on their account about £.130,000. Theſe ſeveral ſums amount to about £ 730,000." Not one of them is honoured with a place on my eſtimate, or provided for in my bill.</p>

            <p>How it ſhould have entered the head of any man, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with public affairs, that the pay due to our line for 1782 conſtitutes a part of the ſtate debt, is difficult to be conceived. We here ſee it comprehended in the continental debt; and certificates are now iſſuing to the officers and ſoldiers for that pay, and for all that is due beſides upon a final ſettlement.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to deficiencies in our contributions during the war, it is neceſſary to ſpeak more fully, to give clear ideas on the ſubject. For ſeveral years, congreſs made large requiſitions, to enable them to carry on the war. Not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle ſtate contributed, in any one year, its full proportion. It is owing to this, that the national debt exceeds 42,000,000 dollars. Commiſſioners are appointed, on behalf of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, to ſettle with each of the ſtates. The commiſſioner, or whoever finally ſettles the account with Maryland, will charge u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with our full quota of the whole requiſitions, and give us credit for every thing, we have fairly advanced. There will unqueſtionably be a great balance againſt us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps much more than £.400,000. The caſe will be ſimilar with every other ſtate. What then is to be done, when all their accounts are finally coſed? Muſt they diſcharge each its reſpective balance, and contribute its quota of the national debt beſides? By no means; for that would be paying twice. What then will be the end of appointing theſe commiſſioners? It will be, to aſcertain the actual contributions of every ſtate. If a ſtate has advanced beyond its proportion of the whole which congreſs has received, then congreſs will be indebted to it for the exceſs. If it has advanced leſs than its propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will then be indebted to congreſs for the deficiency. We have conſtantly boaſted of our exertions, we have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018517_0024_0FA7AE661EC56D18"/>great credit with our ſiſter ſtates, and I incline to believe, this mighty affair of deficiencies will, at laſt, turn out to our advantage.</p>
            <p>The whole debt then, not compriſed in my eſtimate, is our quota of continental bills. With reſpect to this, we have managed poorly indeed! We have neglected favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of calling it in, at little expence; and in the end, ſome of the ſtates will perhaps gain an advantage. However, this part of our debt is that about which we may of all others be the leaſt ſolicitous; we may wait, till congreſs determines what ought to be done. Should any gentleman be ſeriouſly of opinion, that this part of our debt ought to be paid as ſoon as any other; ſhould he approve my plan in general, and be ſatisfied of the ſufficiency of the funds; let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by way of amendment, that debtors be allowed to pay continental bills, at the rate of 140 for one, which is double the value they paſſed at, juſt before they ceaſed to circulate; that they be exchanged for bonds; and, when every other purpoſe ſhall have been effected, that the ſurplus be applied to the buying them up, until the whole of our quota ſhall be called in.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Certain debtors are indulged with a further time, for obvious reaſons. The red money was called out of circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by methods, not preſcribed in the act for its emiſſion. It would be idle to allow them to pay any other paper, if we did not afford them a reaſonable time to collect it. To let looſe upon them immediately the <hi>vengeance of the law,</hi> would produce deeper ſcenes of diſtreſs, than were exhibited during the war. By the law now in force, the money, when col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, muſt be locked up, and until a certain period, remain uſeleſs. Both policy and juſtice, on this occaſion, muſt plead for mercy. Let it not be ſaid, that, by indulging our debtors from time to time, we only encourage a bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>meable remiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They have had no indulgence, that ought to have been denied. They will exert themſelves when there is a proſpect of ſucceſs; the purchaſers, who have not entered into bond, will make haſte to complete their contracts, and many will be found in condition to make payment, ſo ſoon as we ſhall allow them to diſcount government ſecurities. I have propoſed another motive for their diligence; after the firſt of January 1785, they may have it in their power to pay only in ſpecie.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It remains to ſay ſomething to an objection, which has had no little weight with thoſe, who are ſatisfied with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018517_0025_0FA7AE66ACC64F90"/>words, and general expreſſions, and cannot bear the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of a rational enquiry. It has been aſſerted, that the preſent plan originated from malice, and that it is only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to defeat better meaſures, and to undo all that has been done for retrieving our affairs from diſorder. I ſhould be happy to diſcover thoſe ſchemes, and to contemplate the proſperous train already ſaid. The buſineſs ſurely could not be concealed from an inquiſitive eye, from the aſſembly, and from all the world. In plain and ſober truth, there has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been nothing like ſyſtem, or plan. A ſucceſſion of crude, indigeſted meaſures, ſpringing from diſguſt, from pique, from whim and caprice, have plunged us further and further into difficulties, have diſſipated our reſources, and done irreparable injuries to individuals. To prevent further miſchiefs, the bill for the relief of public creditors contain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the only rational, enlarged, comprehenſive ſcheme, that has yet been propoſed. If it ſhould not perform every thing I have promiſed, it could not fail to perform a great deal, and the ſtate would be no further bound, than it already is, to provide ample funds to fulfil all its engagements. No loſs, no diſhonour, no diſadvantage, can poſſibly flow from the experiment; it is calculated to make the moſt of the preſent funds; it gives all creditors of the ſame deſcription an equal chance; it affords a reaſonable relief to-debtors; it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate the affections of both theſe claſſes of citizens; and it will tend manifeſtly to <hi>diminiſh the expences of government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the manner, in which I have urged my propoſitions, it will be concluded, that I am deeply intereſted in the ſcheme. The ſearcher of all hearts can alone be acquainted with my motives, which are perfectly immaterial in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of a public queſtion. I have, however, not the leaſt title to a ſingle bill of credit, or certificate. I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the ſtate. I am not diſpoſed to hazard my charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by ſpeculation. In ſhort. I have no intereſt in the plan, which has employed ſo much of my attention, except that which may reſult from the general happineſs, proſperity, and honour of my country.</p>
            <p>I PROCEED to ſome conſiderations, reſpecting our quota of the national debt, the recommendations of congreſs, and the relation we bear to that reſpectable body.</p>
            <p>If I underſtand their eſtimate of the national debt, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted on the firſt of January laſt to 42,000,375 dollars, the intereſt of which is 2,415,956 dollars. They have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018517_0026_0FA7AE6A06F69F90"/>the ſtates, by every conſideration which can affect an honeſt mind, to paſs ſuch acts as will enable them punctually to pay the intereſt. They have ventured to recommend a mode called the 5 per cent. impoſt, by which the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t ſum of 915,956 dollars might be raiſed, with the greateſt eaſe to the people; they have left it to each of the ſtates to eſtabliſh ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual funds for ſupplying its proportion of the reſidue, which is 1,500,000 dollars; and they have made the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance of every ſtate neceſſary to give efficacy to the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any. The mode they have pointed out has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by ſome of the ſtates, and every art is employed, by deſigning men, to induce others to reſcind the acts, by which they have adopted it. The ſecond part of their recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I believe has been complied with by only two ſtates in the union. At the laſt ſeſſion of our aſſembly, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect to have heard it even mentioned. There are three ways, by which this backwardneſs in our ſtate has been juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. In the firſt place, "It would anſwer no purpoſe for one ſtate to do what the reſt have declined." In the next place, "The back lauds claimed by individual ſtates, of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the whole, and would alone conſtitute a fund ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the punctual payment of the intereſt, and for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging within a reaſonable time the principal of the whole national debt." Again, "If that fund be inadequate, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to congreſs, we are not in condition to pay either principal or intereſt. As we have done ſo much for poſterity; as we have taken ſuch care for tranſmitting to them the fair inheritance of freedom and independence; it is reaſonable, they ſhould ſhare the expence." A little ſober reflection will convince every rational man, how idle, unjuſt and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, are all theſe excuſes and evaſions. In the firſt place; as it is impoſſible for thirteen legiſlatures at the ſame inſtant to do the ſame thing, if each waits for the reſt, the requiſition of congreſs can never be complied with; but it has redounded much to the honour of thoſe ſtates, which have diſcovered an ambition to be foremoſt.</p>
            <p>The "addreſs and recommendation to the ſtates, by the United States in Congreſs aſſembled," from which I extracted the eſtimate of the national debt, was not duly circulated; there are few who have ſeen it. I ſhall therefore preſent another extract for the information of thoſe, who may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour theſe ſheets with an attentive peruſal.</p>

If we ſhould be diſſatisfied with their deciſion, I know not whither we ſhall carry an appeal for redreſs. Ought we on that account to diſſolve the union?

This they have never required. They wiſh to owe our compliance to our free conſent, and not to their own power. Away then with all idle fears and fantaſtic jealouſies, or let them be transferred to their proper objects. Theſe are the men of turbulent reſtleſs ſpirits, who although they may be uſeful, in ſounding the alarm, when tyranny endeavours to ſteal up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us by imperceptible ſteps, are equally oppoſed to every kind of government, and ſometimes acquire a tranſient popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, by rendering it odious to the people.</p>

That whatever expence has been incurred, in conquering, or ſecuring theſe lands, ſhall be reimburſed, is a condition, to be granted to thoſe ſtates which ſhall relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh their claims. It is perhaps contrary to the immediate intereſt of this ſtate, for congreſs to accept the conceſſion on ſuch terms; at leaſt, thoſe lands cannot for many years pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a greater revenue than will enable congreſs to perform the condition

                  <p>Six millions of acres, which is a tract of country larger than this ſtate, would produce only £.300,000 at £.5 for 100 acres.

The national debt does not create the only demand for money. The government of the United States cannot be carried on without it, unleſs we could go on for ever upon credit, without taking a ſingle ſtep to ſatisfy our creditors. I believe that ſubſtantial reſource congreſs, for the preſent, is deprived of; and it will require a great deal of wiſdom in congreſs, and in the different legiſlatures, to regain it. To prevent further requiſitions for defraying the expence of its government, for maintaining a peace eſtabliſhment, and for guarding every part of its territory, congreſs is obliged to depend on further loans. The back lands may hereafter conſtitute a fund for diſcharging the new debt, and for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding againſt contingencies. A ſubſtantial fund for this latter purpoſe ought undoubtedly to be veſted in the ſovereign power of a republic, which has no authority, upon any emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, to levy money by taxation, without the conſent of thirteen other deliberative bodies. Congreſs has however engaged to apply the revenue to ariſe from the back lands to haſten the extinguiſhment of the national debt; and, ſince neither congreſs as a body, nor its members as indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, can have any motive for acting contrary to the true intereſts of their conſtituents, they will perform the engagement whenever it can be done with ſafety and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</p>
            <p>To talk of leaving to poſterity the burthen of the debt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted during the war, is truly ridiculous. I have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe idea of what is meant by the poſterity of a ſtate. The term, when applied to an individual, every body compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends. I ſhould be glad to know what proportion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals compoſing this republic, or whether the whole, muſt quit this earthly ſtage, before the ſucceſſion of poſterity is to commence. To refer our creditors entirely to poſterity, would be little more than a declaration, that they never ſhall be paid; for, if we entertain ſo poor a ſenſe of our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they and their repreſentatives can have little depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on our poſterity. Beſides, poſterity muſt, at all events, bear the burthen of the eſtabliſhments we now make. They muſt, perhaps for a long time, pay the intereſt of the debt, and at laſt find means to extinguiſh the principal. Added to this, they may have troubles and burthens enough of their own. It was the wicked, ungenerous policy of anticipating the public revenue, and entailing debts upon poſterity, which has wrought ſo many evils to Great-Britain, and laid the foundation for the diſmemberment of their empire; and it is
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018517_0032_0FA7AE72848D40B0"/>the buſineſs of an infant government to profit from the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all, that have gone bef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>re it.</p>
            <p>Let us now aſcertain our proportion of the intereſt of the national debt. If 141,517 dollars are our ſhare of 1,500,000, then 227 999⅕, equal to £.85,499 13 0, is our quota of the whole. From the bottom of my heart, and in the fince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my ſoul, I deſpiſe the man, who would hint at the inability of this ſtate to furniſh congreſs annually with this ſum. That man, if he is not ſtrangely mifinformed, or weak in his intellects, was never a true whig; he is diſhoneſt to his neighbour, falſe to his benefactors, and ungrateful to Providence.</p>

            <p>It is with extreme diffidence, I make a propoſition, which may rouſe t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e indignation of the whole powerful body of land holders; but, I believe, no man can point out a more proper and effectual mode of complying with the indiſpenſable requiſitions of congreſs. Imports will be ſufficiently taxed by the five per cent. ſcheme; and we could not, at any rate, with prudence, impoſe further duties thereon, unleſs all the neighbouring ſtates ſhould do the ſame. Duties on exports would be ſtill more detrimental to our commerce, and would, moreover, be ſuppoſed principally to affect the landed inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. We cannot eaſily contrive to eſtabliſh a revenue for 25 years, to be derived from an aſſeſſment on all property, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe perſonal property is perpetually fluctuating, and it would require the enormous expence of aſſeſſors and commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for every year. All ſources of revenue, except what I have mentioned, would be inadequate, and might more properly be applied, to defray the expences of our own go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">The congreſs depended too much on the good ſenſe of their conſtituents, to make any proviſional requiſition. Acting upon the plaineſt demonſtration and the true principles of policy, they did not ſay, "If you do not chooſe to grant us ſubſtantial and effectual revenues, for the term of 25 years, to enable us to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your debt, we entreat you to contrive at leaſt to ſupply us with money, to pay your reſpective quotas of the intereſt for the year 1784." I cannot diſcover, upon what principle the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature of this ſtate, by the ſupply bill, directed a ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, "not exceeding one half of the whole aſſeſſment," to be tranſmitted to congreſs for the payment of the army. Had they attended to the eſtimate, the recommendation and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of congreſs, they muſt have perceived, that their plan went no farther than to pay the intereſt of the army debt, as well as that of other debts. This ſtate's proportion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of that debt, including commutation, does not exceed £.21,000. One half of the aſſeſſment will amount to about £.42,000, and this, it ſeems, congreſs is to receive, with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular directions as to the application. If our aſſembly expected the obedience of congreſs, they muſt entertain ſuch an opinion of that auguſt body, as would not warrant the leaſt dependence on their conduct. Suppoſe another ſtate to have gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed a ſum for the payment of our illuſtrious and generous ally; it is eaſy to perceive how inconvenient it would be, for congreſs to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don its own ſyſtems, to gratify the whims of each diſtinct legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature. This "one half of the aſſeſſment" was voted without any regard to our quota of the whole debt, or of the amount of either principal or intereſt of the army debt; it was merely arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; it might have been more, or leſs; it was given unaſked; we did not know that other ſtates would paſs ſimilar acts, or that the officers and ſoldiers of the Maryland line would derive any material benefit. I am not at all oppoſed to the tranſmitting this money to congreſs; they have abundant uſes for it; it may come ſeaſonably to anſwer ſome occaſional purpoſe; they may conſider it as a free gift, or give us credit for it in our account current; but it will not ſupport the honour and good faith of the conſederacy, give ſatisfaction to creditors, or convince the world, that we have done our duty.</note> An annual contribution, to be raiſed by a new law every year, would never anſwer the views of congreſs; it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018517_0035_0FA7AE7674958088"/>for them, without ſubſtantial, effectual, and certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, to eſtabliſh a new credit, or to afford any ſecurity to their preſent creditors. An annual contribution muſt depend on the will of every new legiſlature in thirteen different ſtates, who, upon every little pique or idle jealouſy, might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their ſupplies, embarraſs our affairs, and endanger the union. No man in his ſenſes would lend money to congreſs, under ſuch circumſtances, or accept an aſſignment of its aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances, on terms advantageous to its creditors. We have ſufficiently experienced, how little regard a new legiſlature pays to the engagements of the laſt, how differently it views the ſame ſubject, and how vilely the moſt ſolemn aſſurances have been proſtituted.</p>
            <p>The rate, I have thus propoſed to lay upon real property, would be inferior to what has been laid on all property, for ſeveral years. By the laſt valuation, the whole of real pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty amounted to £.6,303,143 17 10½; the rate of 18 ſhillings on £.100 would produce the groſs ſum of £.57,000. I conceive, however, that if real property were fairly eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, it would amount to at leaſt £.12,000,000; a rate of 9ſ6 on £.100 would in that caſe be ſufficient; but whether the propoſed valuation ſhould prove higher, or lower, than the preſent, it would make no manner of difference to land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders in general; for ſhould the valuation be higher, the rate muſt be lower; and, ſhould the valuation be lower, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018517_0036_0FA7AE774DDBD618"/>rate muſt be higher; in either caſe, the ſame ſum would be paid for the ſame land.</p>
            <p>I take it to be an eſtabliſhed point, that, impoſe what tax you pleaſe, the party, who is immediately charged, contrives to throw the burthen upon others. It comes round to all; and, at laſt, every one is compelled to bear his proportion. In ſome caſes, indeed, the party even derives an advantage. However, to conciliate the fav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur of thoſe, who cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend theſe poſitions, I would not, for any purpoſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, propoſe a further tax upon real property.</p>
            <p>THE moſt ungrateful part of my undertaking remains behind. As it was my original intention to give the citizens of this ſtate ample information reſpecting the ſituation of their affairs, I cannot omit to ſay ſomething reſpecting the expences of our own internal government.</p>

            <p>This ſum is to maintain thirty-two perſons, many of whom are expected to poſſeſs talents, which would render them eminent in any private employment; they muſt reſide at the ſeat of government; and "dedicate their time, abilities, and labour, to the public." Could ſociety ſubſiſt without government, or could government be conducted without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legating power to individuals; or, if it were reaſonable that theſe individuals ſhould <hi>beſtow</hi> their "time, abilities, and labour;" or, if patriotiſm would alone be a ſufficient motive for others, equal or ſuperior in merit, to execute the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, expenſive, and invidious offices of ſtate; there would indeed be juſt cauſe to clamour againſt even the moſt ſcanty allowance, as every farthing ſaved would be ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the burthens of the people. But, as civilized ſociety never did, or can exiſt, without government; as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment cannot be carried on by all the perſons compoſing ſociety; as the power of adminiſtering the laws muſt reſide in a few; as the public has no right to expect, the whole burthen ſhould be borne by a few, without a ſuitable reward; as the ſhare, which each man in the community contributes to this reward, is ſo exceedingly light; how are we to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the endeavours of ſo many leading men, to exhibit the officers of government in ſuch odious colours to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? It is eaſy to account for their ſucceſs; the people have ever wanted information; they have been taught to believe, that if it were not for the accurſed civil liſt, they would have no reaſon to dread the frequent viſits of a collector; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every farthing extracted from their pockets, the fruit of honeſt induſtry, is dealt out to a few idle men, who are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oting in luxury, at the capital, and, at the ſame time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulating fortunes for their deſcendants. It is devoutly to be wiſhed, that the people would think more for themſelves, that they would learn to reaſon, and calculate, and that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience would teach them to diſtruſt the men, who ſolicit their ſuffrages, under the ſpecious pretences of conſulting their intereſt.</p>

About £.11,330,000 being the valuation of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty within the ſtate, although far inferior to the actual worth, it will require 17 pence in the £.100 to pay the civil liſt and delegates in congreſs. An eſtate, then, which is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at £.1000, contributes to this purpoſe 14ſ2. He muſt be a ſtrange ſenſeleſs being, who, for this, is diſpoſed to conſider government as a curſe rather than a bleſſing; and he muſt be totally ignorant of the nature of our government who ſuppoſes, that its officers will contrive to engroſs the whole 15 ſhillings tax, to be raiſed by the ſupply bill.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, that great merit will, by ſome well meaning, ill informed perſons, be aſcribed to the preſent aſſembly for their ſingular oeconomy. Any man that will inſpect the acts and reſolutions of each aſſembly, and calculate the value of paper money at the different periods when it was paid, will be convinced, that the preſent ſalaries are nearly double the average allowances, ſince the revolution; that this article of our expenditures created but a ſmall part of the demands of government; and that the people have not, on this account, one year with another, been taxed more than nine-pence in the £.100, on a very low valuation of their property. Let him go further, and eſtimate the expence of living during the whole time, and he will perceive that an officer, ſo far from ſaving money, could not, by the moſt rigid oeconomy, have ſubſiſted on double his allowance, agreeably to his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even "in this petty republic." When he looks round, and ſees the daily increaſe of luxury and diſſipation; when he reflects, that at this period, an univerſal rage for wealth has ſeized all ranks and orders of men, that no ſtation, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or character, can command reſpect without at leaſt a decent competence; he will hardly expect men of real worth, for a paltry allowance, to occupy the laborious, troubleſome offices of government, and thereby exclude themſelves from the emolument of private employments. It will be too much to look for inflexible integrity in the ſervants of the public. Neceſſity will perpetually urge them; and they muſt renounce either their virtue, or their places; the moſt worthleſs cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters will ſucceed them, and the public, in the end, will be loſer by an ill judged parſimony. This obſervation muſt ſtrike every one, that it would be infinitely better to employ an honeſt intelligent ſteward, at a liberal ſtipend, than truſt to a knave or a fool, and pay him no wages at all.</p>
            <p>The whole amount of ſalaries does not equal a moiety of what was paid by the people of this ſtate to the late proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018517_0039_0FA7AE7FCB820798"/>and his lieutenant-governor. It does not equal the contributions of a ſingle town to the ſupport of a theatre. I will acknowledge the ſuperior merit of the gentlemen, who "hold the mirror up to nature." They afford us an elegant, agreeable, rational entertainment. By their conduct in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life, and the excellent leſſons they inculcate on the ſtage, they cannot fail to improve our taſte, refine our manners, and promote induſtry, ſobriety, oeconomy, and every other concomitant virtue. But the poor officers of government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire food, habitation, and raiment, as well as they. Is it poſſible, without ſpleen, to hear a man exclaiming bitterly againſt the civil liſt, becauſe he is compelled to contribute about the 2000th part of his property to their ſupport, whilſt he cheerfully lays out 10, 20, or 30 times the ſum at the theatre. The bare recital of his conduct is a ſufficient ſatire on his underſtanding and principles.</p>
            <p>It is alleged that offices are multiplied without neceſſity. Perhaps the public might ſuſtain no injury by aboliſhing a part, and by ſo doing the ſum total of ſalaries might, upon the preſent ſaving plan, be reduced to leſs than £.7000. But after every reform, which prudence might dictate, £.10,000 could not, by any cool, diſcerning, rational man, be thought too much for the maintenance of the officers, who ought to be left. This would require an eſtate valued the laſt year at £.1000, to pay annually about 17ſ6, inſtead of 14ſ2, which it pays at preſent; and any worthy proprietor of ſuch an eſtate would conſent to pay the difference, if he reflects, that this trifling addition to his tax would convert a ſordid, illiberal, contemptible eſtabliſhment, into one that is decent and reſpectable, and at the ſame time would give the beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the faithful adminiſtration of the laws.</p>
            <p>I wiſh not to conceal the intereſt I have in this buſineſs. It is cloſely connected with that of the public. I have more than once, with the freedom which becomes a republican, expreſſed to the aſſembly a ſtrong ſenſe of the injuries I had ſuſtained, by repeated infractions of public engagements, and a total diſregard to the principles of the conſtitution. To the man, who will attempt to combat plain reaſoning and honeſt claims, by ridicule and ſarcaſm, I will only ſay, that he has an unfeeling heart, and a happy front. However, let the public reſpect liquidated claims in which I have no concern; let it in other things conſult its own honour and intereſt, and I will, without a murmur, ſubmit to my loſs, and give every claim of compenſation to the winds.</p>

There is one demand for money, to which, it would ſeem, every other muſt ſubmit. The leſs opulent members of the aſſembly muſt punctually receive their pay, at the cloſe of every ſeſſion. The citizens of this ſtate are not generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, that the expence of holding the aſſembly has, every year, exceeded the allowance to civil officers; and yet not even the preſent increaſed allowance to its own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is generally agreed, that the preſent valuation of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty by aſſeſſors is far inferior to the actual worth. Should we eſtimate from the extravagant ſales upon long credit, the value of all the private property within the ſtate would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to at leaſt £.30,000,000. The real value, calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating from ready money prices, and ſales upon ſhort cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, where the purchaſer may be depended on, is at leaſt £.20,000 000. I have ſhown that our quota of the intereſt of the national debt amounts to £.85,409 13 0. The groſs ſum of £91,000 might be required on this account. The annual expences of our government cannot exceed £.24,000. The county tax amounts in the whole ſtate to about £.20,000. Theſe ſeveral ſums make the aggregate ſum o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> £.135,000 13 0; and each man's proportion is the price he is to be charged with for protection in his life, freedom, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. This laſt ſum bears about the ſame proportion to £.20,000,000, as 13ſ6 does to £.100. A man then who is worth £.1000, to contribute his juſt quota to congreſs, to the ſtate, and to his county, muſt annually pay £.6 15 0, which is about one ninth of the legal intereſt of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>

I do not pretend to infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; I do not ſay, my ideas muſt be exactly purſued; but I contend, that without more harmony between the ſtates, without more zeal, public ſpirit, and attention in our rulers, without a more vigorous government, without more regard to juſtice, good faith, honour and gratitude, this great and ſtupendous revolution will anſwer no better purpoſe, than to convince mankind, they were never intended to be free. "The laſt and faireſt experiment in favour of the rights of human nature will be turned againſt them, and their patrons and friends expoſed to be inſulted, and ſilenced, by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of tyranny and uſurpation."</p>
            <p>The great objects upon which I have ſo largely, although imperfectly diſcourſed, demand the inſtant attention of the legiſlature. The conſtitution, framed in a hurry, amidſt the tumults of war, upon ſpeculative principles, without a proper conſideration of manners, habits, and local circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, although admirable upon the whole, in many parts demands an alteration. The uncertainty of the law in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the inefficacy of the penal laws, the diſproportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween crimes and puniſhment, the delays of juſtice, the want of regulations in our commerce; all theſe are evils which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an early attention, with the utmoſt care, circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſome inſight into the laws and regulations of other nations. I am amazed, when I hear it ſaid, at the opening of every ſeſſion, that the aſſembly has little to do. I am amazed at the little value my countrymen place on the right of ſuffrage. Would to heaven, my feeble efforts could rouſe every man to his duty. Ye guardians of the ſtate! Ye choſen

Your taſk indeed is ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous; you will have to encounter every oppoſition, which reſentment, envy, and all the malignant paſſions, can dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; but true virtue is generally ſuperior to all aſſaults; and, if your labours ſhould prove ineffectual, your boſoms will poſſeſs that ſweet tranquillity, which ignoble ambition or triumphant villainy can never experience.</p>
