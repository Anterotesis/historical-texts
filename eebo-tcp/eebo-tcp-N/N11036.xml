            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>LIKE that fell monſter, and infernal tyrant, Charles the firſt, you are determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge the land with innocent blood. Fired with rage at the more than ſavage barbarity of your mercenary troops, your curſed inſtruments of ſlaughter in America, I can no longer keep within the bounds of decency; the breaſt of every true Engliſhman muſt be filled with indignation, and that reſpect which is due to a king, will be loſt in a noble zeal for the preſervation of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and fellow ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Every man muſt execrate a tyrant, who can without remorſe to ſatiate his revenge, and gratify his luſt of power deſtroy millions of his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>The Americans, Sir, are fighting for liberty, the birthright of every man, they are fighting for the laws and the ſacred conſtitution of their country, which you are, to your eternal diſgrace and infamy, endeavouring to deſtroy: Their cauſe is a juſt, it is the cauſe of heaven, and it never will be in your
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:013986_0002_0F9259AC05E68B38"/>power, aſſiſted by ten thouſand legion of tyrants beſides, to fix your bloody ſtandard of tyranny in America. England muſt take a part in this bloody, this unnatural civil war, brought on through your baſeneſs and ingratitude, and the treachery, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and villainy of your minions; unleſs ſhe does this, ſhe is loſt forever, your unrelenting cruelty, and deſire of being abſolute, will never let you ſtop, and if once the Americans can be reduced to ſlavery, we ſhall be no longer free; you will not, you cannot reſt, till you have brought the whole empire into the ſame ſtate of vaſſalage and bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: But I hope for the honour and valour of my countrymen, all your infamous deſigns will be fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, and that by a noble exertion, in defence of their perſecuted brethren in America, they will ſoon convince you, how difficult, unſafe, and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it is to attempt to enſlave a brave and free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to eſtabliſh your throne in iniquity and blood.</p>
            <p>I hope fired with the noble ſpirit of their anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they will ſpeedily carry to the throne, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than petitions or remonſtrances; I truſt they will tell you in manly terms, in terms, worthy of Britons; in terms that may ſhake your tyrant ſoul that they are determined to be free, that you ſhall withdraw your troops from America; that your miniſters ſhall be delivered up to juſtice, as ſome attonement for the blood that has been inhumanely ſhed in England and America; that they will have all their rights confirmed to them; that they will be governed by the laws of the land, and not by the arbitrary will of you or your minions; that without theſe juſt and neceſſary requiſitions are complied
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:013986_0003_0F9259ACDF5FF3B0"/>with, they are determined to appeal to heaven, and oblige you, as their forefathers have other princely tyrants to govern according to law and the ſolemn oath you take at your coronation.</p>
            <p>Engliſhmen, Sir, will ſoon be rouſed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human ſlaughter of their brethren and fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in America, from a ſtate of lethargy and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineneſs; it will not be long in the power of your infernal tribe of placemen and penſioners, your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and minions, by all the arts of corruption and debauchery to keep down the glorious ſpirit of liberty; they will not, they cannot, if there is any virtue in the nation, longer remain idle inactive ſpectators of ſuch cruel and bloody meaſures, in which they are ſo nearly, ſo deeply intereſted; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in which muſt end in the deſtruction of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and the conſtitution, the boaſt and glory of this, and the envy of every other nation.</p>
            <p>Your whole reign has been one continued ſeries of tyranny, oppreſſion, cruelty, and injuſtice; the whole buſineſs of your miniſters has been to deny right to the people, to ſap the conſtitution, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh arbitrary power upon the ruins of public li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in every part of the Britiſh dominions; to feed your avarice, to gratify your ambition, and ſatiate your revenge againſt individuals.</p>
            <p>A king, weak, obſtinate, perverſe, and cruel, deaf to the calls of humanity, and regardleſs of an oppreſſed, injured, and loyal people, diſgraces the dignity of human nature; and is ſo far from poſſeſſing any of thoſe attributes which characteriſe majeſty, that he is only a monſter in human ſhape like the devil, inveſted with power, not for the preſervation, but the deſtruction of mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="unknown:013986_0004_0F9259AD832A45B0"/>
The breath of a tyrant blaſts and poiſons every thing, changes bleſſings, and plenty into curſes and miſery, great cities and flouriſhing kingdoms, into deſarts and gloomy ſolitudes, and their rich citizens into beggars and vagabonds. I could name cities, which while they governed themſelves, could maintain armies, and now enſlaved, can ſcarce maintain the poor proud raſcals who govern them. It is certain, that whatever country or place is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by a prince, who governs by his will, is ruined by his government.</p>
            <p>You, Sir, like moſt other princes, have been long introducing the Turkiſh government into Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and have ſucceeded ſo well, that I would rather live under the Turk, than under the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of George the third. You practiſe the inhuman cruelties and oppreſſions of the Turks, and want the tolerating ſpirit of the Turk, and if you are not ſoon checked through the native bravery of Engliſhmen, the whole polity of ſavage Turkey, will be eſtabliſhed by you in all its parts and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity; as if the depopulation which is already ſo quick, and taking ſuch dreadful ſtrides, were ſtill too ſlow.</p>
            <p>Tyrants are the common deſtroyers of mankind; they are for ever inventing new machines of cruelty, and will, till the deſtruction of mankind is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted. They ſeem to think they ſhall have ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as long as one man remains, who cannot be made a ſlave. But it is aſtoniſhing at firſt view, that Engliſhmen ſhould have ſo long borne your tyranny, oppreſſions, and unrelenting ſlaughter of their fellow ſubjects: But, alas! who knows not the force of corruption, deluſion, and ſtanding armies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="unknown:013986_0005_0F9259AE3A8CD888"/>
Oh liberty! Oh ſervitude! how deteſtable are the different ſounds! Liberty is ſalvation in politics, as ſlavery is reprobation; neither is there any other diſtinction but that of ſaint and devil, between the chamption of the one and of the other.</p>
            <p>No one can ſufficiently ſhew the glorious advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of liberty, nor ſet off the dreadful miſchieſs of raging, relentleſs, conſuming tyranny.—A taſk to which no human mind is equal; for neither the ſublimeſt wits of antiquity, nor the brighteſt geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us's of late or modern times, aſſiſted with all the powers of rhetoric, and all the ſtimulations of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etic fire, with the warmeſt and boldeſt figures in language, ever did, ever could, or ever can, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe and heighten ſufficiently, the beauty of the one, or the deformity of the other:, Language fails in it, and words are too weak.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who do not groan under the yoke of heavy and pointed vaſſalage, cannot poſſibly have images equal to a calamity which they do not feel; and thoſe which feel it, are ſtupified by it, and their minds depreſſed; nor can they have conceptions large, bright, and comprehenſive enough, to be fully ſenſible of their own wretched condition; much leſs can they paint it in proper colour to others. The people of England, Sir, who enjoy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, lovely, and invaluable bleſſing of liberty, know that nothing can be paid too dear to purchaſe and preſerve it. Without it the world is a wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and life is a miſerable burthen: Death is a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute we all owe to nature, and muſt pay; and it is infinitely preferable, in any ſhape to an ignominious life: Nor can we reſtore our being back again into the hands of our great creator, with more glory to
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:013986_0006_0F9259AF16BEAD78"/>him, more honour to ourſelves, or more advantage to mankind, than in defence of all that is valuable, religious, and praiſe worthy upon earth.</p>
            <p>How execrable then, and infamous are the wretches, who for a few precarious momentary, and perhaps imaginary advantages, would rob their country for ever of every thing that can render life deſirable; and for a little tinſel pageantry and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile homage, unworthy of honeſt men, and hated by wiſe men, would involve millions of their fellow creatures in laſting miſery, bondage, and woe; ſuch unnatural royal parricides, unworthy of the human ſhape and name, would fill up the meaſure of their barbarity by entailing, poverty, chains, and ſorrow upon their own poſterity: And, Sir, you ought to remember ſuch tyrants have unpitied, ſuffered in their own perſons, the ſad effects of thoſe cruel councils and ſchemes, which they intended for the ruin of all but themſelves and their minions; and juſtly fallen into that pit they had traiterouſly digged for others.</p>
