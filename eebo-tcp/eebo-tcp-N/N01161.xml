            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere are two things which I shall offer by way of Preface. <hi>First,</hi> Concerning my meeting with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses in my proceeding to Print. 2<hi>dly,</hi> As to the smallness of what I shall print.</p>
            <p>As to the first, <hi>viz.</hi> my being repulsed at the beginning of my proceeding, I must confess it made a very profound and ungrateful Impression upon me, and made me weep before the Lord, and lament after this manner, Oh, that God would take away my Life from me! Oh, that I might have my Request, even to dye! And being full fraight with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings, it made me argue after this manner, O Lord! if indeed thou be the Author of this my Concern, and thy Power is strong above every power of the Enemy, Why am I thus disappointed, rejected and contemned? But after a time my Spirit was brought under the Moderation of the Cool of the Day, and then I saw, that God, for Reasons known to himself, doth suffer the Blasphemies, Revilings and bitter Reproachings of the basest of Men, and by that we are taught not to exalt our selves above our Lord and Master. And further, the matter was clear'd up to me, from those Scriptures, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.35. 'tis said, <hi>A certain Man of the Sons of the Prophets, said unto his Neighbour, in the Word of the Lord, Smite me, I pray thee; and the Man refused to smite him, &amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>Judges</hi> 20.18. 'tis further said, <hi>And the men of</hi> Israel <hi>arose, and went up to the House of God, and asked Counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the Battle?</hi> [Pray observe] <hi>And the Lord said,</hi> Judah <hi>shall go up first.</hi> And I don't find that we have any reason
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001383_0003_0FB2E5F36C4B3FA8"/>
to suspect but all this proceeding was from the Lord, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, the ensuing Relation informs us, that they were twice worsted before their Enemies. And I think this may be sufficient to silence all the Reasonings of men in that kind, as it did mine.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> As to the Compendiousness of what I shall publish in print, I have this to say, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis best known to my self how long I laboured under a reluctancy, and how very unwilling I was to appear in print at all; for it was, indeed, a secret terror to me to think of making a contemptible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in the world, being apprehensive nothing would render me more so, than if my Offering was small, though in the opening of the Seals of the Mysteries of the Kingdom; I was taught, that it was the little Oyl that filled all the empty Vessels, the little Seed whose product out-flowrisht all Seeds, and the little Leven that levened all the whole Lump, and the little Stone that became the great Mountain, and filled all the whole Earth And I think its very worthy of observation, that at the opening of the seventh Seal, there was silence in heaven. But notwithstanding all this, I knew full well, that to make but a small or little appearance in any respect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever was nautious, hateful and very ungrateful in the eye of the world. And further, I considered, that at this time the world is full of Preaching and Praying, Writing and Printing, and it would seem but a very insignificant thing for me to step in among the Crowd with that which would look like adding another Drop to the great Ocean, &amp;c. I should have been willing to have gone forth in the way which I would have chose, but the way which, I saw, I was like to be concerned in, did not please me at all, because I found, that to deliver any thing contrary to the vulgar received Opinions, was rather the Object of Scorn and Ridicule, than the subject of sober Consideration. All these things, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001383_0004_0FB2E5F7A4401EF0"/>
many more considered, has made me very backward and remiss in bringing any of my Works to view; but as Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, <hi>Overturns,</hi> Overturns are to happen, till he comes to reign whose Right it is; so my potent Enemy [<hi>Ambition</hi>] whilest I fled before it, was a firey Serpent, with a deadly sting, but having been often forced to turn upon it, the formidable Monster is become tame, that I can take it by the Tayl; and blessed be the God of Victories, now I can hear my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation called in question, without being stung to the heart. Some Peoples Manuscripts uses to receive additions by lying by, but from mine I have diminished pretty much of what I first intended to publish, having for a long time been willing to decline it; so I don't care how little it is, if three words would have answered the Obligation I am under, I think I can truly say, I should have been glad. So I shall be brief and compendious in giving in my Relation, as followeth,</p>
            <p>WHy it pleased the Almighty to bend his Bow and set me as a Mark for his Arrow, not only from my Youth, but even from my very Infancy up, I know not but even so it has been; for to the best of my remembrance I was but about six or seven years of Age when first I had strange and numerous Apprehensions of a future state, and a fear to dye, and after to be cast into Hell, would make such strong Impressions of Horror upon my Spirit, which caused me to weep and tremble, and often to wish I had never been born. And the weight and inward sence and feeling of those things keeps me in great awe before the Lord. Well, I arrived to the age of about fourteen years, and then Pride, the chief evil I was naturally inclined to, became a very potent Enemy against me; and tho' I was but young I found I was in an evil case, by the strong propensity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001383_0005_0FB2E5FEE88B8FF8"/>
to the Influences of evil, not that I was sensible of the Deformity of evil in it self, no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but because I was smitten, pincht and restrained in my Libertine progress, for I really believed that Pride and Luxury, and abundance of outward Riches to uphold it, was the chiefest good; and on the other hand, to be limited to Obedience, Humility and taking up the Cross, was an intolerable Confinement, but under this, considered, I was afraid going to Hell was worse, so I continued in this Condition some years, being extreamly addicted to decking up my self, going abroad and keeping of wild Company; but this state was rendered very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to me, because I was still followed with a secret terror what the evil would be. Sometimes I should wish and hope there was no God, and sometimes pray, that if there was, he would by any means bring me nearer to himself. Thus it was with me till I entered into the 19th year of my Age. And then at the latter end of the Summer I was visited with a violent Feaver, which brought very extream pain upon me, and made me mighty impatient and restless, but did not bring me much under the apprehensions of Death; but I thought, if I should have the small Pox, which was then in the Country, I should surely dye; for I had all the Summer, at times, been under the terror of it, and had blooded and taken Physick, and practised several things as Remedies against it, tho' at that time I thought I was pretty secure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being at a considerable distance from where it was; nevertheless, that which I greatly feared, was to be brought upon me, for in the midst of my Illness, which I thought was already more than I could bear, it accidentally happened that my Brother came home sick, and in a short time his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness appeared to be the Small Pox, which when I understood, it struck me into such extream terror that <hi>I</hi> could scarce keep within the bounds of Moderation; for now <hi>I</hi> thought there
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001383_0006_0FB2E600AF87C150"/>
was no Remedy, <hi>I</hi> being too weak to be removed from home; so <hi>I</hi> had no help to escape, but by keeping from my Brothers Chamber, which I carfully did; but contrary to my expectation, and to my great grief, in a few days my Brother dyed, and in about a week after my self was seized in a very violent manner, and soon was brought under the dismalest aspect that ever I was sensible of before. I thought now was the time that I had from my Infancy feared: now <hi>I</hi> must dye, and to Hell <hi>I</hi> must go, as the reward of my Pride; that was the chief thing presented before me; and in this condition I made many Protestations and Promises to my self, if God would graciously grant me a Reprieve, and give me a little longer time, which <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> had no reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect; but as my Terrors within, so my Distemper without continually increased, tho' <hi>I</hi> had been urgent for the assistance of the Doctor, and the application of what might be proper for my Relief, but it was all to no purpose; for in a short time my Distemper was so violent that <hi>I</hi> expected no other but in a few hours or minutes to be choaked, being in extream thirst, and every thing <hi>I</hi> took forcing its passage thorow my Nose. And in this Distress <hi>I</hi> earnestly desired some small Beer to be given me, promising to my self, that if <hi>I</hi> could swallow that, it should be a sign to me that God had not forsaken me. And when <hi>I</hi> came to try the experiment, this found passage down very comfortably, which was an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding joy to me, insomuch that it forced my feeble Body upon my knees, to give thanks to him who <hi>I</hi> did not know but might have mercy on my Soul, which <hi>I</hi> supposed to be in a very dangerous Condition at that time; but this spark was soon blown out by the returns of my fear, terror and anguish of Spirit, which remained strong upon me for many days, having blindness without and darkness within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every night <hi>I</hi> expected to dye; and in my slumbers thought <hi>I</hi> was actually
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001383_0007_0FB2E602305F25F0"/>
in Hell; but his Judgments he mixt with Mercy, and lifted me out of the horrible Pit, and gave respit for a time.</p>
            <p>And after some time, when <hi>I</hi> was pretty well recovered of my Distemper, only <hi>I</hi> remained weak, as <hi>I</hi> was one morning lying in my Bed, ruminating in my mind, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the bitterness of Death was past, on a fuddain, before <hi>I</hi> was aware, <hi>I</hi> found my self overcome with a divine Sweetness, which all my life before <hi>I</hi> had been a stranger to, this made me say, in the words of <hi>David, O Lord, if ever I forget thee, let me be forgotten by thee; and if I prefer thee not above my chiefest joy, let my Tongue cleave to the roof of my Mouth.</hi> But my pleasant Theam soon folded up, and the divine Ray with-drew, leaving this word with me, to wit, <hi>Obedience is better than Sacrifice</hi>; and also, a strong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction upon me to leave off my little Fineries, and vain Complements, and to take up the much despised saying <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to a single Person. This again brought a strange Impression of horror over me, and raised a great unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness, and strong Reasonings offered themselves, and a foolish shame got the dominion over me, which altogether brought me even within a hairs breadth of rebelling; but <hi>I</hi> awakened not long before upon good ground; <hi>I</hi> submitted, tho' it was not without Tears. But soon after <hi>I</hi> found it was to double advantage; for whereas before <hi>I</hi> took delight in nothing but reading Romances, decking up and receiving and giving Visits, (not that by my saying of this <hi>I</hi> am about to represent my self as a Gentlewoman by Birth, which had nothing else to do; No, for my Mother found me other imployment beside, tho' it was often sore against my will; but now <hi>I</hi> was under a total alteration; for having been kept from visiting by reason of my illness, about half a year, my propensity to that exercise was pretty much abated, tho' <hi>I</hi> suppose it would soon have renewed its strength; but <hi>I</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001383_0008_0FB2E604F83D9158"/>
was ashamed to see or to be seen of my former Acquaintance and Companions, because I durst do no other than appear in a way that was very contemptible in my own eyes, and <hi>I</hi> suppose no less in the eyes of others; but it was not long before this Cross lost its sting, and <hi>I</hi> became not only easy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but pleased with my great Change of affairs; and <hi>I</hi> began to take delight in Gardening, and applyed my self, with pleasure, to the Contemplation of Matters Philosophical and Divine. But this was not the end of my progress in trouble, as by the sequel you will find. For soon after the old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser and Troubler was let loose against me, and represented before me, That now <hi>I</hi> had submitted to this Light within, <hi>I</hi> must be obedient and perform all the preposterous Actions, but above other things, the fear of going Naked was sharp upon me; this was like a Sword to my Nature, which from my Child-hood had been bashful, to an extream; but <hi>I</hi> soon got over this Terror; but it continued with me to be mighty full of Though and Considerations, passing and re-passing in a perpetual Motion, sometimes one fear wou'd be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, and sometimes another; but at length it was fixt upon me to believe, <hi>I</hi> was still short in the faith of Christ crucified, and my work not yet finished; the whole systim of Religion was become a very intricate knotty thing to me, and if <hi>I</hi> might, <hi>I</hi> shou'd have been very willing to have let it all alone, but <hi>I</hi> was entered in the list, and cou'd by no means free my self; and since it was so that <hi>I</hi> cou'd not get out, <hi>I</hi> thought it was best for me to be industrious to get Instruction; but <hi>I</hi> found that Men nor Books cou'd not do it, and to apply my self to God <hi>I</hi> was afraid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the smart of that teaching <hi>I</hi> had received; and also <hi>I</hi> wondered in my self that <hi>I</hi> received no fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes from that anointing which I thought was desirable above all things, but this I could not obtain, neither could
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001383_0010_0FB2E60FA7296400"/>
               <hi>I</hi> be satisfied. And then I considered I had heard great talk of great matters in <hi>Pennsilvania,</hi> and being willing to try that experiment, I prepared my self, and came over, but when I came, tho' <hi>I</hi> was diligent in seeking, and seldom mist any opportunity of going to Meeting, yet in nothing could <hi>I</hi> find the sweetness which was comparable to that which first tinctured my Soul. This was my Condition all that time, which, I think, was about three years after <hi>I</hi> first received the Seal of the Covenant of God. And thus was my Troubles, which I kept reserved to my self, not being willing any Body should know how it was with me; and also, <hi>I</hi> think it was then about, that the fear of Preaching fiercely invaded me. This Passage is not to be omitted, for it was a very considerable exercise to me, the which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me several years, with very ungrateful Retors, That the first Revelation I had was to turn <hi>Quaker,</hi> and I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other but the next would be to turn Preacher, and that <hi>I</hi> should rebel, and there would be an end of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, and so I must to Hell at last. With this <hi>I</hi> was so harrast and tormented, that it became as great a terror to me then, as the fear of Death had been to me before. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed my Preaching could be of no other Service than for a Cross to my self; and if I must suffer, <hi>I</hi> strongly desired it might be by any other means which might be private to my self; and moreover, I found, that my former enemy (<hi>Pride</hi>) had invaded me again, tho' not in the same manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet it was no less troublesom; for tho' it had pleased God graciously to bring me so far, that it was not hard for me to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly before the Lord my God, but I was exalted in Pride above my fellow Creatures, and could by no means behold Persons or Things that were in any respect poor or mean, without an eye of Contempt; this very thing brought me under profound dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietings
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001383_0011_0FB2E6128F6786F8"/>
of Spirit, insomuch that it often made me kneel down, and weep, with this Lamentation in my self, That I was afraid Pride would one day be my Destruction. And being thus continually assaulted, pursued and molested, it totally weaned me from all outward things, so as I could say in truth, <hi>Lord, I have none in Heaven but thee, nor none in Earth but thee</hi>; and <hi>I</hi> hoped to be forgiven that which <hi>I</hi> could not help. And being very weary of my very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Life, it made me as earnest to dye as before <hi>I</hi> had been to live. And often I importunately besought the Lord to take away my Life from me, arguing what good I could do. I much wondered what strange place, I knew not what nor where, I should enter into, when I did dye; however, I was willing to try the experiment, but no such good tydings was allotted for me; but at times I received secret Whispers, That I must come to further Sufferings, to have the root or original of sin wrought out, to be made perfect. And I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I could not but wonder what I could suffer by, more than I did; for I thought they were very considerable already. But, Oh! Wo is me, what have I suffered since that time! No Tongue can tell, nor none that on earth doth dwell.</p>
            <p>Thus far is my Relation of what I suffered under the first Covenant, as a Servant in the House, it being about the space of five years. Now I shall proceed in recounting the Passages of my Travails or Pilgrimage after I received the Seal of Adoption or Heirship to the Promises of God, which are Yea and Amen forever, to all who believe and obey his Commands. I kept no outward Journal, but as near as I can reach it in Memory, it was in the year 1694. in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Winter when I was mightily hurried hither and thither by an increase of my former Discomposures of Mind,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001383_0012_0FB2E61367901128"/>
but one day it happened that I had an unusual quietness, stillness and easiness rested on my Spirit, which made me hope, my condition would be rendered better than it had been. But the day following, which was the 23th of the 11th Moneth, in the Morning waking, I was seized in a very wonderful manner with an extream Weeping, and, as I hinted before, that I had fixt upon me a sence, that <hi>I</hi> was short in the <hi>Knowledge of Christ crucified,</hi> and in the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Kingdom of God; so now it was set in upon me, with a mighty Force, like a Fountain opened, and these words were stampt or engraven, as with an Iron Pen, or as with the point of a Diamond, <hi>viz. I know nothing, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand nothing; surely I am more bruitish than any Man,</hi> Prov. 30.2. <hi>Distraction and Misery are in my ways, and the way of Peace I know not.</hi> With this Lesson <hi>I</hi> arose, and with this Lesson <hi>I</hi> went to bed. <hi>I</hi> soon grew mighty Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, and hated Company, excessive Weeping being my greatest ease and comfort; and also, <hi>I</hi> was much inclined to sleep. Thus I mostly spent the time, till the first First Day in the First Moneth, which was between six and seven weeks; which Day <hi>I</hi> have cause to remember above the rest of Days; for in the Morning I was seized with an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Restlesness, which made me impatiently wish for the Day to begin; but the approach of Night proved no better to me; for in the evening a chill horror came over me, and <hi>I</hi> was cast into a profound Abyss of Torment, which by the teaching and experience I have had since, <hi>I</hi> can suppose to be no other than the Pit of Hell; and under this extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity I threw my self down upon the Bed, my Complaint being taken away, where I lay till about Mid-night in that Condition, which I shall never forget, and then <hi>I</hi> arose, and kneeling down, fell instantly into exubrancy of Grief, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the most passionate manner that ever <hi>I</hi> was sensible of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001383_0013_0FB2E615109E8828"/>
before in all my life, and there I lamented my self a while, and then went to Bed, where I lay till Morning, still under the same impressions of horror; and all the comfort I had was in the hopes, That a few days would put an end to my wretched Life; and <hi>I</hi> suppose it was about seven or 8 in the Morning, when I thought I felt my self seized with the temporal or bodily Death; this made some alteration upon me, which I can no way express But then was the time, under this sharp hour of Temptation,
<q>
                  <l>That once again the Lord discover'd his Grace,</l>
                  <l>And openly shewed to me his face.</l>
               </q>
And e'er <hi>I</hi> was aware my Soul made me like the Chariots of <hi>Aminadab,</hi> and joy and peace, light and gladness shone round about me, and God engraved, as with the point of his Scepter, That I had been faithful in a few things, and should be made Ruler over many things. And at that time he shewed me, That the chiefest good consisted in love, and displayed his Banner of it in a very wonderful manner, and promised me an establishment in Perfection of all the degrees of it, that is, To love the Lord my God with all my Soul and Strength, and my Friend as my self, with a reciprochal or mutual affection. This was the prize which was set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, for above fourteen years past, as the Reward of Overcoming. And at that time it was fixt upon me with such an indissoluable tye, which since has made me perceive it with force and vigour, even to this very day; and often it comes upon me with a Power which I can by no means with stand, to pray with earnest Supplications and Tears, That God would raise me up a Seed, that we might behold his glorious Majesty, contemplate his wonderful Works, and the operations of his hands, and enjoy his Mansions or Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which he has prepared in the West and the South; I say, that we may be partakers together, and Inheriters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001383_0014_0FB2E61A4111D978"/>
of these his peculiar favours and blessings, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and inherent desire of my Soul.</p>
            <p>But to return from this my short digression, <hi>I</hi> shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on in my Relation of the further Dealings of God with my Soul. It was at that time also that he revealed to me, That <hi>I</hi> should — but have a Race set before me, which if <hi>I</hi> endurd or held out to the end, then <hi>I</hi> might expect great matters, or glorious things to ensue; and in this Vision of the Almighty <hi>I</hi> had fullness of joy, and concluded that God did not intend now to destroy me, which all along before <hi>I</hi> was afraid of. So now by this change of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>I</hi> was made able to rise and go about, it being the second Day of the Week, and that day and the next <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under a sweet sence of what <hi>I</hi> had seen and felt; but the third Day a great impatience came upon me, in a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous manner, for a speedy performance of those things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and <hi>I</hi> came under a temptation to fast till all the work was accomplisht; but for this <hi>I</hi> received a gentle Reproof, and the word was to me, <hi>That God would do for me, but not in my time, nor by my Covenant.</hi> And then <hi>I</hi> arose and took some Sustenance for my Body, being weak with fasting from about the middle of the 3d Moneth, as near as <hi>I</hi> can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. And then for a short time <hi>I</hi> was mounted again above the Waves and Billows, and was exalted very high, with the impression of the whole of <hi>Balaam's</hi> Policy, but more especially where 'tis said, <hi>And his King shall be higher than</hi> Agag; <hi>and his Kingdom shall be exalted very high.</hi> These things brought me to an exceeding high Mountain, where <hi>I</hi> saw all the world no more than an Ant-hill, and all People but as Grashoppers. Here the Lord spake very Friendly to me, as a Father or a Husband, and taught me and instructed, because he intended to lead me in a way which <hi>I</hi> little mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted at that time, though experience has taught me it was
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001383_0015_0FB2E61EC8035C70"/>
wearisom, tedious and rugged. Now it was that <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> might lay all my Complaints before the Lord, and have my Petitions granted, the Spirit of Prayer being strong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. And these three things I earnestly intreated for, 1<hi>st,</hi> That he would lay no more upon me than <hi>I</hi> should be able to bear. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That he would give me a sign or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation that I should never be made to preach. 3<hi>dly,</hi> That he would forgive me what my Misery might extort from me. But <hi>I</hi> received no sign according to my desire; but the word was to me, <hi>In the day of my Power my People shall be a willing People</hi>; and, as I remember, from that day forward, I was free'd from the secret terror of it, which had been like to a knawing Worm to me for several years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this Mountain I was delighted, and thought it was good to be here, and fain would have pitcht my Tabernacle at that time, and gone no more forth, but God designed other things for me; I think it was about the middle of the fifth Moneth, on a first Day of the Week, I was under an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Disturbance and Commotion in my Mind again, and that Scripture was presented in deep Characters before me, where 'tis said, <hi>A Woman when she is in travail hath pain, because her hour is come, &amp;c.</hi> and indeed it was sooner fulfilled upon me than I expected; for in the afternoon, after <hi>I</hi> had been exercised most part of the Day in Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, Tears and strong Cryes before the God of Heaven, I was taken in such a manner as I can give no very intellig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible account of, but the feeling sence of it was such, that I was forced to imbrace the assistance of being held, a pain seizing my Teeth, which served me as an excuse, but in less than an hour I had respit, and at night was pretty quiet; but the next day I was afraid to be alone, and then my hopes were strong, and <hi>I</hi> encouraged in my self, that <hi>I</hi> should be delivered, and see no more sorrow, but, Oh! Wo was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001383_0016_0FB2E62038258900"/>
me, this was the beginning of such sorrow as <hi>I</hi> had never suffered before; for after this <hi>I</hi> was cast out into utter Darkness, and sealed down under such Darkness as might be felt. Before this <hi>I</hi> had been pretty much inclined to sleep, but now it was otherways with me; for my sleep, in great part, forsook me, and <hi>I</hi> had no rest night nor day, and the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication was taken from me, and not being able to sleep it made me practise rising a nights; and also, <hi>I</hi> had a strong propencity to lying on the ground, and this strong Coard of Affliction was bound about me for about two Moneths, and then my Chain was a little loosed again; nevertheless <hi>I</hi> was debarr'd from that which <hi>I</hi> had been willing to part with all for the purchase of. And now my Condition was to be compared to <hi>Cain's,</hi> for <hi>I</hi> was a Vagabond, had no pleasure, delight or inheritance in the earth, and was driven out from the presence of God, which was a punishment greater than <hi>I</hi> was willing to bear. Nevertheless, for all my Discontent and Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it was my place of wandering little odds of eight long years before <hi>I</hi> had a glympse of that Glory that folded its self for me.</p>
            <p>The 3d Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s <hi>Lamentations,</hi> to the 14th <hi>vers.</hi> and the 23d Chapter of <hi>Job</hi> to the end, these with many other places of Scripture (which for brevity's sake <hi>I</hi> omit) were to me as a Parchment Roll, or as the Philacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which are said to be things they always wore upon their Breasts, with the ten Commandments at large; but mine were engraven with Lamentations, Mournings and Woes.</p>
            <p>And at the beginning of this time of my walking to and fro, afflicted, destitute and forsaken, it was, that <hi>I</hi> made a Vow. To eat no Flesh, nor to drink Wine till the Lord appeared to me again. But all this was more supportable
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001383_0017_0FB2E62267A6AE38"/>
to be bore than some other things which I suffered in this Land of Desarts and of Pits, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.6. The desire to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, and have a re-admission into the Fathers Bosom was fixt upon me, even as my outward breathing, but to obtain I had no power nor no might; but much more in the spring of the year my desires and supplications generally were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, like an over-flowing stream. And thus it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated to me to pray, <hi>O Lord God! Remember, I beseech thee, what I have suffered at thy hand! O Lord, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders now, but that I may be delivered, after so long a time of hard Bondage! O Lord! grant now that I may come in Remembrance, now when thou art visiting every thing by the Return of the Spring, even every Shrub, and every little Twig, and every Spire of Grass, and all things partake of thy circulating Virtue, and I only above all other things am ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Miserable! In the Day the Drought consumeth me, and Frost by Night,</hi> Gen. 31.40. And these my Prayers were always attended with great floods of Tears, but all in vain; for I had but a deaf ear turned to all my Intreatys. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hope would flatter me up, and build me a great Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramid, and set me at the top, on highest story of an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation that Heavens Gate would be open to me in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But <hi>I</hi> was no sooner arrived to the highest pitch of my paramount Desires, but <hi>I</hi> should be cast down to the lowest Hell, where <hi>I</hi> was instantly met by a great part of the Infernal Pack: The first started out upon me in a vaunting ridiculous manner, calling me <hi>Whimsical Fool,</hi> and told me, <hi>That I fed my self with Chymarae's and Phansies, and that it was but in vain to seek, for there was no God to be found.</hi> But my Reason and Experience prepared me an Answer, in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> That tho' God had dealt by me contrary to my expectation, and I had been mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in some things, yet I was sure <hi>I</hi> was not deceived in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001383_0018_0FB2E623E9706218"/>
what <hi>I</hi> had tasted of the infusion of the Spirit of Love and Life. But he told me, <hi>This was nothing but a Chance, which happened to me, and that I should never see it again.</hi> Which made me to say, Oh! thou beloved Chance! that <hi>I</hi> may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dwell under thy circling Virtue!</p>
            <p>And after this, a second stands up, in a more demure manner than the former, and he gravely tells me, <hi>That if there was a God, he was become unjust and evil to me, and that I should never be able to endure to the end of my Race; which for ought I knew might be a hundred or a thousand years, and therefore I had better destroy my self by drowning or poyson, which I might act so privately that no body should know it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to this I framed an Answer, as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> That though I was under the discouragement of not knowing how long my Captivity would be continued me, yet on the other hand, I had the advantage of not knowing how soon it would be that I should receive the Seal of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And to the proposal of destroying my self, I was very willing, and should have been glad to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with it, but I was afraid, because I believed that God intended to make me indure to the end of my Race, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would or no; for <hi>I</hi> found, by woful experience, that <hi>I</hi> was very weak, and he was very strong; and <hi>I</hi> thought he was able to stop the operation of Poyson, or to draw me out of the Water; and for my Rebellion I was afraid that he would reward me with the unsupportable punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of of lengthening out the seres of my Troubles; and in this I knew he would be even with me to the full. This was the thing which kept me from tempering in that kind.</p>
            <p>But when I had partly silenc'd the Clamours of these two, up steps a Third, with power and force, and a longer continuance than the former, and this made me fret, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001383_0009_0FB2E60A5C55F7A0"/>
rage, and storm, and wish abundance of impertinent Wishes, beside that of wishing <hi>I</hi> had never been born, or that my Mothers Womb had been my Grave, and made me curse my self the day that I was born, and every thing <hi>I</hi> could think on, but God, and that <hi>I</hi> durst not, &amp;c. And also, he told me, <hi>I did well to be angry, even to Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God loved to afflict me.</hi> And indeed when it was in the cool of the day of Battle, no arguments could have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with me to believe the contrary of this, for my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science bare me witness, that <hi>I</hi> had been willing to part with all things which by Nature's Charter <hi>I</hi> might claim a title to; and also was willing to suffer the greatest extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and could have endured it without murmuring, had it been short; but this long continuance, and often repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed breaking me with breach upon breach, <hi>Job</hi> 16.19. and multiplying my Wounds without a cause, <hi>Job.</hi> 9.17. O this, <hi>without a cause,</hi> filled me with Confusion and horror; and these Infernal Rages were suffered to prey upon me till <hi>I</hi> was brought into such a Condition that <hi>I</hi> can no way, nor by no means express, but it caused me to lie on the ground and lament, and weep till my eyes were sore and swelled, and then I should fall into slumbers, which were rendered short and broken, by the impression of that horror which still gnawed upon me, the which made me start and wake, and then again renew my Complaint, and make me say, <hi>O Lord! is my strength the strength the strength of Stones, or is my flesh of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, that I am made to endure all this?</hi> Job 12.6. But the strength and force of these bitter storms seldom held me above three days, and sometimes not so long before they abated, but almost a continual Melancholly rested upon me, and great Pensiveness: and often with a secret Regret I was caused to ruminate on the happiness of Servants and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, who I saw and heard no singing about, and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001383_0019_0FB2E629E67F3D68"/>
how far their state was better than mine, for after their moderate labour, they could take their food pleasantly, and their sleep quietly; but my Tears were mingled with my Drink, and my Sighings came before I eat: I was scar'd with Dreams and terrified by Visions, and wearisom Nights were appointed for me. I wore out the Day, wishing for the Night, and in the Night was weary of my Bed. Thus sometimes better, and sometimes worse, I wore away the time for many years. Mean while People would often be telling me how happily I lived, and might come and go when <hi>I</hi> would, and have and do what <hi>I</hi> pleas'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but at the same time <hi>I</hi> thought, and not without a bitter cause, That, alas! if they knew all, they would have a less Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of my Happiness! I kept my self private and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, though I was often brought as within a hands breadth of going Raving about the Streets; for I really believed it would be a great ease to me, if <hi>I</hi> might but have had the liberty to have Raved and Ranted publickly; but <hi>I</hi> had the bounds of Decency always markt before me, which upon my peril <hi>I</hi> durst not pass.</p>
            <p>The chief Reasons that <hi>I</hi> thus almost wholly concealed my Condition, was, 1<hi>st,</hi> That <hi>I</hi> expected to be healed by no other hand than that that wounded me. 2<hi>dly, I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the ill Success that befel poor <hi>Job</hi> in the like case, which was, to be reflected on, <hi>That God did but correct him for his Wickedness.</hi> 3<hi>dly, I</hi> considered that there can be no true simpathy without an affecting sence; and I knew that Cryes and Complaints make but a very ungrateful Sound in the ears of those that dwell in ease and pleasure. So upon these Considerations, I thought it was best to keep mine to my self. And, as <hi>I</hi> was hinting before, that it was about eight years, that the Light and Glory which I saw in the Mount, was totally eclipsed from my sight; but by
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001383_0020_0FB2E62B679BEC50"/>
the assistance of Faith and Hope, the dear Companions of all my Tribulations, who never left me, if they could be heard for the Cryes and Clamours which often beset me; <hi>I</hi> say, by the assistance of these, and often sitting down by the Rivers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> (for I had nothing but a bare remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the beauty of <hi>Sion) I</hi> made hard shift to stagger along, till about the middle of the 7th Moneth, in the year 1703. as near as I can remember, on a first Day of the Week <hi>I</hi> was in a retired frame of mind, after (<hi>I</hi> believe) I had gone up seventy and seven Thousand times, and more, to see if <hi>I</hi> could perceive the least appearance of that which my Soul panted after. I felt that which made me say, <hi>But, O Lord, what am I, that thou shouldst shew thy self gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto me!</hi> And now I thought surely the bitterness of Death is past. But, Ah! Wo was me, that I had been ten Thousand times pinacled up in vain hopes; for soon after this, strong Travail came upon me again, and <hi>I</hi> found my self as bad as ever. <hi>O Lord God of Heaven, thou only knows how this Tormented me!</hi> I remember, that <hi>I</hi> thought that if one three Days of what I then suffered, was admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to the World, surely it would reform at once, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>'Twas three days I fasted, and was instant in the deepest descent of the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication. And thus I presented my humble Petitions, and said, <hi>O Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, let this time be the time of Love, for I can never be brought lower than I am now. O Lord, hear me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me!</hi> And after <hi>I</hi> got over this dreadful fit, I entred into a Condition, as it were, between joy and anguish; sometimes in one part of the day <hi>I</hi> should be in sharp pain, which caused me to weep and lament, as with my hands on my Loyns, and, may-be, the same day <hi>I</hi> should be in perfect ease and quiet. And when <hi>I</hi> was in one of these states, the other would seem very remote from me; and to

this day it remains with me to be after this manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the ruminating on what <hi>I</hi> have suffered, and the fear of what I may have yet to suffer, and the consideration, that for all my weary Travails, I have but overcome in part, and am but delivered in part. These, with other things, often bring strong Travail upon me still, and makes me weep, and lament, and pray, and wish, that God would take away my Life from me But nevertheless<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Condition is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered far better than it has been; for these Fits are shorter and seldomer than they have formerly been.
