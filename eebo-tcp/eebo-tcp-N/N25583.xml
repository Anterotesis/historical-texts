            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ORATION.</head>
            <p>WHEN a great nation, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the slow progress of its infancy, or indignant at the oppressive arm of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, imposing restraints on its natural rights, rises to rank itself, among the empires of the world; an object is exhibited to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, worthy its admiration and applause. In such a scene, the good find scope for the anticipations of benevolence, while the great exult in the hope, of spreading a field of glory, wide, and rich with the deeds of ambition. The day we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate ushered into birth, a glorious event. One, which animated, not only the sage philosopher, and the enterprising
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033980_0004_0FF9D7746D744E88"/>
statesman, but which spread a jubilee of joy, as far as civilization and science had announced its existence, or furnished the means of appreciating its value. It was seen, how fruitless were the mild obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of virtuous citizens, and the firm fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of the children of freedom, to quell the passion for power, which prompted the claims made upon our country. How fruitless the love of peace and industrious tranquillity, to check and control the pride of usurpation. In exchange for the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of our forefathers and their latest pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, in their own native land, where na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture invited a receipt of her choicest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, and held happiness out, as the sure reward of industry and virtue, were offered, unconditional servitude or death. It would not have been wonderful, if the hopeless prospect from opposition, joined with that love of peace which is the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of industry, had yielded, to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033980_0005_0FF9D77EDA5DBD98"/>
powerful and imperious nation, a bloodless victory over the future millions of our countrymen. The impudence of power is too often triumphant, while the meekness of honest merit, surrenders at discretion a force, which resistance would have rendered respectable. But it was not for those whose ancestors had fled for free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the deep recesses of an American wilderness, to balance in such an alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Poor in the manufactured means of hostility; untaught in the wiles and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, which warlike experience furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; though strong in that spirit, which springs from a deep sense of injury, the bloody banner was unfurled by America. Persuaded she could not mistake the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of her unnatural parent, the bravely unmasked her resolution. On this day disrobed herself forever of the allegiance she had borne, and asserted her independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. On this day my fellow citizens,

               </gap> commemorate a period, when our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were armed in the land of their nativ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, not for conquest of riches or territory, nor the glaring glitter of military glory; but to defend their own altars, and the tombs of the dead, against an unprovoked aggressor. The gauntlet was taken up. The sword left its scabbard. A thick cloud rose, and spread over our country, for seven long years it's sombre shade. All Europe waited with anxious expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the portentous event. The time would fail me to recount the distressing scenes which attended this period. Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful would be the task, to replunge into the bosom of the father, a recollection of the dagger, which pierced the bleeding vitals of his only son. How oft has he wept at his memory! How severe has been the conflict in his breast, between the fire of patriotism, and the tender stream of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal affliction! Do our villages wrapt in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033980_0007_0FF9BDEA0E1EDA58"/>
flames, or our cities in the dust, require a record to perpetuate their remembrance! Will not the stones of Valley-Forge, red from the bare and bleeding feet of our marching regiments, be more lasting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials, than even the faithful page of history itself! How many mothers still pine with anguish, while memory paints the famine which reduced their infant offspring! How many wives still mourn the partners of their youth, who fell the virtuous victims to their country's cause! How many and dreadful are the events which crowd on the imagination, from the first blood which bedewed the plain at Lexington, to the brilliant triumph at York Town and Gloucester! These were the rich price of our national independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Such the sufferings which purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed our freedom. Scarcely recovered from the struggles, with which the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution convulsed us, behold another storm
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033980_0008_0FF9D793025C7A18"/>
lowers in fury over our devoted heads! In a day which tried men's souls, France was once our friend. Whether excited by the rival jealousy incident to neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring nations; her ancient resentment against Britain; or a more generous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, it is not necessary to decide. She smoothed the rugged walk of war. She divided with us, the dread burden of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial service. How painful is it to the mind, to contrast this view, with our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent relation to that powerful empire. Animated with a passion for liberty which she caught in our revolution, we have seen her rise indignant against the despot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism which enslaved her; rase the Bastile, at whose sight Liberty herself trembled; dash from his throne the monarch she a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored; and exterminate at a stroke the royal blood. We have seen constitution piled upon constitution, revolutions, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter revolutions, massacres and proscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033980_0009_0FF9BDE84C398FF8"/>
banishment and assassinations, blend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one dreadful mass of undistinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed horror. By an unnatural perversion of the order of Justice, conviction prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding trial; and death itself inflicted on the innocent by the guilty, without even the solemn mockery of arraignment. The tender ties of domestic life given to the wind. Private virtue abandoned as hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisy, and fit only to amuse the weak. Religion itself made a crime. And the sacred <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of its worship, robbed, to decorate scenes of most profligate pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism.</p>
            <p>These things are on long record. Tho' it is hoped for the honor of humanity, that virtuous posterity will hardly credit the monstrous detail. Inflated with wild ideas of liberty, and conscious of great internal strength, through the reciprocal aids of intrigue and force, France has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033980_0010_0FF9D79FA909E7B8"/>
on most of its neighbors, involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary freedom. At once the most polished and populous country in Europe, what government has escaped the shocks of its fraud or its force! What people remain unimpressed, with a sentiment of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, to make its dominion broad as the earth, and extensive as the ocean. Were cases demanded of its <hi>unsolicited benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, its inhuman tenderness, its fraternal ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;</hi> how easy might be named the Batavian Republic, Geneva, Venice, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, and Switzerland! A country hitherto dear to America, from a sympathy excited by a similarity in its fortunes! Dear too, as the strongest asylum of European free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. How ardently was it hoped, that when expelled from the plains, the strong holds and fastnesses of thy mountains, would have lent her a lasting retreat! These countries, and others which might be named, have laid aside their sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033980_0011_0FF9D7AB81A5C4A8"/>
and on the bended knees of submission, accepted a tenancy at will, from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of France. But why look abroad for testimonies of her haughtiness and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? What wave of the Atlantic is not a swift witness, of her illegal capture of our vessels, and spoliation of our trade! What harbor on our coast, whose lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing commerce, does not mourn for injuries which she has inflicted! What goal in our country, does not contain some wretched bankrupt, an innocent vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of the perfidy of France! And do we merit this, on terms of national faith and justice? A stroke of the eye, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our people and government, will readily evince.</p>
            <p>When the European world became convulsed, by the engagement of France in the cause of reforming her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the avowal of principles which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033980_0012_0FF9D7BA772EF400"/>
were unfriendly to its royal cabinets; it was easy to be perceived, that a coalition would form against her. That neutrality and inaction against <hi>her,</hi> would be deemed treason against <hi>mankind.</hi> The first repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican minister therefore who visited these western shores, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both his wishes and sentiments on the attitude it should <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to view in France the friend of our country, and the guardian angel of our independence, an interest was felt in her fortunes, unusual to nations in amity. Though it was an event of great hazard, a neutral stand was taken. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Executive accredited with open aims the agent of the new Republic. Taught by experience the numerous ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities which wait on a revolution, what heave was not exerted to anticipate (to the republic) the debt due to France, as a means of her relief! Our rich granaries
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033980_0013_0FF9BDD4D674EE90"/>
and stalls were poured into her ports, to feed her famishing armies. The starving exiles of her islands, hunted from their homes, were fattened on our national bounty. Fidelity to our engagements with France, has in every act of adminis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration appeared dear to the heart of the Executive. This fidelity, in his instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to ministers abroad, he has charged them never to impair. Nor has it ever been held secondary to any national ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, however great or alluring. Have the people of these states been forgetful of the duties which cordiality and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence inspire! Witness the peals of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral joy, which rang on the arrival of the first ambassador from the Republic. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness the silent patience with which they have borne the delay, to satisfy their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense and uncontested claims upon the government of France. These are the considerations, in violation of which, she still requites us, with outrage, calumny
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033980_0014_0FF9D7C8A9BC3C10"/>
and contempt. Spurns from her thresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the successive ministers of reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iation, and tramples under feet the pacific messages of explanation and esteem. Were she in our condition, what conduct might have been expected from her? It is deemed needless to describe the energy of resentment, with which <hi>she</hi> would have met such accumulated insults.</p>
            <p>Faithful to the trust reposed in them by their fellow citizens, steady in view of those obligations, which humanity and justice impose on every nation; behold the wisdom and vigilance of our councils! With what solemn zeal, have they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued an adjustment of the existing differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with France! How long, and how patiently have their ministers besieged the cabinet of Paris! How painful the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, how degrading the contempt, which has persecuted their respectable mission.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:033980_0015_0FF9D7CDF655E598"/>
But my friends, there is a point at which forbearance should cease, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity becomes criminal. Thither we are arrived. The Rubicon is now behind us. It is not for me to prescribe to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers opinions on facts. But when it is perceived, that every act of sovereignty in our government gives offence to France, the strongest circumstances urge on the mind a belief, that our <hi>Independence</hi> is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to her. And that nothing short of its dereliction, will satiate her rapacious ambition. The Executive chair, is not filled by the candidate of <hi>her</hi> choice. The sentiments held in his official com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, are not such as <hi>she</hi> would have prompted. Our Envoys Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary bore characters different from those of <hi>her</hi> election. But even with <hi>these she</hi> would in <hi>her</hi> clemency have condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to treat, provided (like ten tenants who bear rent to their landlord) they had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tribute of millions as the price of

Without a sovereign right for the purpose, and it shall not be operative.—The SINE QUA NON of all her hopes and measures toward this country, is, the pepper corn of acknowledgment. In whatever drapery she may clothe her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, with whatever sophistry conceal her pretensions; every other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her is at present of minor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, compared with that of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our dignity, to yield her a power, paramount our own.</p>
            <p>If we do not mistake her designs. If in this transient glance on the relations of our country, we see plainly, that France has as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to us a place, in her chart of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction

and division of empires. If she has matured her measures to dismember Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica. If she has aided our advancement to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence and glory, in order more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, to dash us to the dust. What then is our duty? Where is the inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for which our ancestors contended, and which is endeared to the sons, by the blood of their fathers! Poor is the consolation of a choice of tyrants. It was not to become the Helotes and vassals of a new master, claiming a right of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting liberty to mankind, that Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans have burst the chains of foreign bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Remember my friends, this inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is sacred. Forget not the rich price of its purchase. Your honor, your fortunes, your lives, and all that is dear to you, by a solemn appeal to heaven, on the day we celebrate, were once for all, pledged for its guarantee. Unborn pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity

will demand it at your hands, unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, by the ravages of usurpation. In its defence, the sleeping heroes who pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the vital stream, to secure it, will from the earth where they fell, inspire the soul to duty and to glory.—Remember—The VENERABLE WARRIOR OF MOUNT VERNON, whose sword long drawn in his country's service, is now hung in his hall. Frequent he reviews its deeds, and the lambent flame of glory which still hangs on its point. He still beholds the embattled plains where its victories laurel'd his temples. And when the nerves of his arm shall be unstrung by age, the ancient patriot will oft cast his eye upon the faithful weapon, while the purple tide of ebb in his bosom, glows with reverend rage at the wrongs of his insulted country. Reflect on his services, his character, his counsel, and his solemn legacy to mankind, when the curtain was

            <p>Having long since counted the cost of submission, it is found, that no computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can equal its evils. To yield tamely to unjust demands, or to compound with a foreign power for one half of our rights, is at the same time to merit and endure, the fate of slaves. This I trust is a fate, which will never be assigned to America. Death in all its horrors, is clad in birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day robes, compared with slavery. Let

every friend to his country, rally around its standard. Let its virtuous, firm, and independent administration, while it diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses happiness at home, be the strong buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to guard us against our foes abroad. Let our confidence in its integrity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle daily as danger approximates. Sanction the laws by an obedience, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prompt and cordial. Discountenance a spirit of disunion, that spirit which is an element of perdition. Let us guard our own rights, by soundly informing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in what they consist, and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the government in securing them to us. Discourage those who calumniate and revile the legal authorities. Teach them, with the energy of a soul devoted to its country, that the speculative errors of our own government, (if such existed) have no relation to the outrages of France. Fraught with danger from without, the present crisis is ill adapted to the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms

of extreme jealousy of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Such things, embolden and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply those enemies which lurk in the vitals of America. Bear on the mind, that the successes of France in Europe, have been uniformly composed of force, co-operating with her own treasonable arts and address among her foes.</p>
