            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Brotherly Kindneſs is what God wou'd have Believers to diſtinguiſh themſelves from others by. This is in Scripture made one diſtinctive Character and Badge of the Chriſtian Profeſſion. Thus, Joh. 13. 35. <hi>By this</hi> (ſaith our Bleſſed Saviour) <hi>ſhall men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have love one to another.</hi> So, 1 Joh. 3. 10. <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil: whoſoever doth not love his Brother, is not of God.</hi> Brotherly Love is the very Mark, and Livery of our Lord's Family. It is one of the <hi>Criteria,</hi> whereby Believers are to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt themſelves <hi>a peculiar People, ſeperate from Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> And by this Profeſſors in the firſt Times of the

            </p>
            <p>NOW this goodly Raiment, is what the Apoſtle exhorts us to <hi>Put on.</hi>—<hi>Put on Kindneſs.</hi>—The Phraſe t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

By the Fall we were ſtript of this Spiritual Garment, and we come naked into the World. A Man may with as much propriety and truth be ſaid to be born <hi>dreſst,</hi> with his Cloaths on his Back, as endued with a true Principle of <hi>Charity</hi> in his Heart. 'Tis a Complaint of an ancient Date, and ever true of all in the ſtate of unrenew'd nature,—<hi>Homo Homini Lupus.</hi>—Men are naturally mere Wolves, <hi>living in malice and envy, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and hating one another.</hi> There may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed the ſhadow and appearance of Love in a Wicked Man, but not the Truth and Reality.</p>
            <p>AND when we are <hi>Exhorted</hi> to <hi>Put on</hi> Kindneſs; It may note,—That we ſhou'd get <hi>furniſhed</hi> with the Mantle of Chriſtian Charity, provide our ſelves with it, Have it in a readineſs and not have it to ſeek in time of need.—And that this ſhou'd be <hi>proportionable</hi> to us; anſwerable to our Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

We muſt put on Charity as duly as we put on our wearing Cloaths. There muſt be an habitual fixed diſpoſition to it, and a perſevering exerciſe of it. "We muſt always appear in it, as in our Cloathing, and never without it"; and reckon our ſelves undreſt, to our ſhame, if it be off at any time.—We muſt put it on as <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour:</hi> We muſt buckle it on regularly and be covered with it entirely, as Soldiers compleatly Arm'd: and we muſt daily be proving our Armour, that we may grow skilful and expert in the uſe of it, and that it mayn't be a burden to us.—We muſt put it on as an <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> with as much care and exactneſs as a <hi>Bride</hi> puts on her nuptial Attire; with as much Delight and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction as a <hi>Prince</hi> elect, His Crown &amp; Robes of State; and with as much Solemnity as the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of old His goodly Mineſterial Apparel.—In a Word, Our Charity muſt be <hi>viſible,</hi> apparent, and <hi>ſhine before others,</hi> as Rich and Splendid Raiment upon us doth; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhould appear great and diſtinguiſh'd from others, as a Man by the peculiar Habit of his Office.

            <p>AGAIN, Kindneſs is ſeen and ſhown in a thankful <hi>Accepting</hi> of Good Offices <hi>from</hi> others, and a readineſs (when their is occaſion) to come under, and make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of, Obligations <hi>to</hi> others.

Further, It is the Property of a truly Chriſtian temper, to make ſuitable Acknowledgment of the Bonds we are under to others; to be apt to aggravate Benefits receiv'd, and ready to make all proper Returns and Requitals, in ſuch a way and manner as ſpeaks Humility, Gratitude and

Benevolence: and not ſo as will bewray Pride, Envy, Ill-will, uneaſineſs and impatience under, and a ſullen haſte to diſcharge our ſelves of, our Obligations.</p>
            <p>AND thus I've in ſome ſort ſtated the true <hi>Nature</hi> of Kindneſs, and ſhown what is imply'd in the Duty of the Text. Paſs we now to another Thing propos'd, which was—</p>

            </p>
            <p>I come now—</p>
            <p>III. TO conſider what <hi>Grounds of Obligation</hi> and <hi>Encouragement</hi> there are to Chriſtian Kindneſs.</p>
            <p>I Shall ſingle out from among many others the few following Arguments, which I ſhall but glance upon. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. TO be Kind to others, is required of us by many <hi>Divine Precepts.</hi> Beſides our Text, there are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of other Scriptures that bind this upon All. Thus, Eph. 4. 32. <hi>Be ye kind one to another,</hi> So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Love as Brethren. Be Pitiful, be courteous.</hi> This indeed is one of the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>capital</hi> Laws of the Goſpel, and of the ſame Obligation and Importance with the Law of Faith. Hence Faith in Chriſt, and Love to our Neighbour, are enjoyned together, as one and the ſame Commandment, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23.—And now, do we profeſs Homage to the bleſſed God, as our Lawgiver and King, and ſhall we trample on the <hi>Royal Law of Love,</hi> and tranſgreſs one of the Subſtantial and Cardinal
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002118_0027_0FBB93A0FAAFF0E8"/>
Duties of Religion, peremptorily enjoyned, very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and moſt earneſtly preſſed and inculcated upon us? If we think we can approve our ſelves <hi>obedient Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> in the neglect of this <hi>weighty matter of the Law,</hi> we groſly delude our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS is to imitate the <hi>Beſt Patterns.</hi> Beſides the many Examples of the <hi>Saints,</hi> who <hi>have obtained a good Report,</hi> we have the moſt engaging Example of the <hi>Bleſſed God,</hi> and of <hi>our gracious Saviour.</hi> Our Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>of great Kindneſs, full of Compaſſion,</hi> and <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Goodneſs;</hi> He is <hi>kind, even to the unthankful and the Evil.</hi> Well then may we make that Inference, of our Saviour, (Luk. 6. 36.) <hi>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father alſo is merciful:</hi> And that of the Apoſtle (1 Joh. 4. II.) <hi>Beloved, if God ſo loved us, we ought to love one another.</hi> Conformity to God is Man's chief Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Beauty. God's Goodneſs, or Kindneſs is what He reputes His chief Glory and deareſt Perfection. And ſhall we not aſpire after this bright and ſhining Character of the Divine Image? <hi>Be ye imitators of God as dear Children, &amp; walk in Love,</hi> Eph. 5. 1, 2. Moreover our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath left us an Example, that we ſhould follow His Steps. <hi>ye know the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Kindneſs &amp; Love of God our Saviour,</hi> How He <hi>Pleaſed not Himſelf, went about doing Good, follow'd after the Things which make for Peace,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in all the various Offices of Love to the Souls and Bodies of Men. And <hi>His</hi> Example is monitory of <hi>our</hi> Duty, and bids us <hi>Go &amp; Do likewiſe.</hi> Phil. 24, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Look not every man on his own Things, but every man alſo on the Things of others. Let this mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> We ſhould write after the excellent Copy, He has ſet us; and by a diligent i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. THIS is to act <hi>agreeably to the End of our Creation,</hi> and <hi>the true Principles of Humanity.</hi> This is becoming

            <p n="4">4. THIS <hi>puts a Luſtre on all our other Excellencies.</hi> Are we wiſe or Witty, or Learned, or Dextrous in Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, or have we Wealth, or Power, or Reputation, or other Accompliſhments &amp; Qualifications whatever, They furniſh us with ſo many Advantages for being kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and beneficent to others: and the employing them to this end is what ſets the price upon them, and gives them their true Excellency. <hi>Without</hi> this they have <hi>no</hi> Glory in compariſon. This is <hi>the Excellency of Dignity, and the Excellency of Power,</hi> the Crown, the Beauty and Perfection of all our other Beauties and Perfections.
