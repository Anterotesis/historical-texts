            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CALCULATIONS ON AMERICAN POPULATION.</head>
            <p>FROM a comparison of the most au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic estimates of the inhabitants in the several <hi>British</hi> colonies in <hi>America,</hi> taken at different times, it appears that the British Americans have <hi>doubled</hi> their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in every period of twenty-five years from their first plantation. A rapidity of popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be parallaled in the annals of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope! It has never been equalled since the patriarchal ages. This rapid population of the Americans arises, partly from the great accession of foreigners, but principally from the natural increase of the inhabitants. The reasons, why the Americans are more prolific than the Europeans, are, that they are less luxurious in their manner of living, and the means of supporting a family can be more
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014625_0005_0F94329E31380960"/>
easily obtained. For the last reason the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans are induced to marry earlier in life, and consequently their families of children are more numerous. And their temperance in diet renders them more healthy. The ease of procuring subsistence for a family is occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the boundless tracts of uncultivated fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, bordering on their plantations. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very new-married couple can, at small ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, purchase a freehold; which by their industry, will afford them and their children a comfortable support.</p>
            <p>TILL the wilderness back of the old plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations shall be filled with inhabitants, and brought under as good cultivation as the settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the sea-coast, it may be presumed that the <hi>future</hi> population of these colonies will be as rapid as the <hi>past.</hi> By an estimate made, at the late CONTINENTAL CONGRESS, of the number of persons in eleven of the colonies, it appears that there are 3,026678 souls, inhabiting those colonies. Allowing that there are 526678 slaves, which allowance is probably larger than ought to be made, there are 2,500000 British Americans, which may be reckoned as a CAPTIAL STOCK, on which a calculation may be made of their future population. Should nothing intervene to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard

their increase, the Americans will be more numerous than their brethren in Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in half a century from the present time: And in less than seventy years, their numbers will exceed those of the inhabitants of Great-Britain and Ireland, taken collectively.—Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py had it been for America, if its present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with the parent state had been postponed to the middle of the next century! And more happy still had it always slept in silence! Britain and America might always have been subservient to each others prosperity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; and have formed one of the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, potent, wealthy and happy kingdoms that ever existed.</p>
            <p>UPON the same principles that Mr. WARD has constructed a table to compute the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound interest on any sum of money for the component parts of a year, a table may be formed to compute the number of inhabitants in any American colony for any given year.— Let 1 represent the present number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and <hi>a</hi> the number at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next year. Then it will be as 1: <hi>a:: a: a2</hi>:: <hi>a2</hi>: <hi>a3</hi>:: <hi>a3</hi>: <hi>a4</hi> ∺ to <hi>a25.</hi> That is, As the present number of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants is to the number of the second year, so is that number to the number of the third year, and so on in the same proportion to the twenty-fifth year.</p>

            <p>BY this operation we find the value of <hi>a</hi> true to the 9th figure, and only too much by 2 in the 10th. — And by involving the value of <hi>a</hi> to its 25th power, we have the amount of unity to the 25th year; the index of the power, denoting the particular year. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the number, corresponding to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power of <hi>a,</hi> be multiplied into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent number of inhabitants, either of any one of the British American colonies, or of the whole continent, the product will be the amount of inhabitants of that colony, or of the continent, for the year denoted by the index of the power of <hi>a.</hi>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:014625_0009_0F9432A07B6DAF20"/>THE ratio of annual increase may be found, and a table constructed for estimating the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual amount of the Americans, by a process less operose and equally exact. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess is this: Take the logarithm of 2 = <hi>a25</hi> from any table that will afford a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of figures for the proposed calculation; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it by 25 the index of <hi>a,</hi> and the quotient will be the logarithm of <hi>a.</hi> This last logari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thm being multiplied by 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. to 24 will give the logarithms of the intermediate powers of <hi>a</hi>; the several multiplicators being the indices of their respective powers. Find the natural number corresponding to each of these logarithms, and it will be the amount of unity from the 1st to the 25th year inclusively.</p>
            <p>THE following table was constructed, by ascertaining the ratio of the annual increase of the British Americans, according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, of solving <hi>adfected</hi> equations. But in this method, where the quantities are <hi>surd,</hi> there will always be a <hi>defect,</hi> or <hi>excess,</hi> in the roots found. The error will increase at every invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and be proportionate to its power. In the process the value of <hi>a</hi> was taken true to seven figures, but was too little by about 4/10 in the eight. When this number was involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014625_0010_0F9432A13A708A70"/>
to its 25th power, it discovered itself, in the last operation, to be, 000019 less than just; and consequently that there was a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable defect in each involution. The <hi>excess</hi> or <hi>defect</hi> arising from the involution of a root <hi>greater</hi> or <hi>less</hi> than just, may be corrected by the following proportion. As the value found of <hi>a25</hi>: to its <hi>excess</hi> or <hi>defect</hi>:: the value found of any other power: to the <hi>excess</hi> or <hi>defect</hi> of that power. And the several <hi>defects</hi> being added to, or the several <hi>excesses</hi> being substrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from, the numbers first found, will be the value of the several powers of <hi>a,</hi> so near the truth as to answer all the purposes of a calculation of this kind.—But the small er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror noticed above was corrected by taking the logarithm of 2 from Mr. <hi>Briggs</hi>'s table, and ascertaining the value of the several powers of <hi>a,</hi> in the method already notice. By his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the annual amount of unity may be taken true to nine places of decimals, which is a greater degree of exactness than the proposed plan required. For this reason eight decimals only were taken into the calculation. And therefore by multiplying the inhabitants by the numbers in the table, we have their amount for each year, without any error, where they are less than 10,000 000: A degree of exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, sufficient for any calculation of this kind.</p>

                  <p>SHOULD the proportion be sought, which the posterity of the first settlers of any colony bear to the whole inhabitants of it at present, it may be ascertained in the following method, supposing them to double by <hi>natural</hi> increase in twenty-five years.</p>

                  <p>COULD the number of original settlers be ascertained, the question might be determined with precision. The rule however may be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by taking any number at pleasure, instead of the true number of original set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers.—Let us then suppose the first settlers amounted to 5000.</p>

This number divided by 25, gives 5 for the quotient, and 20 for the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. 5000 redoubled 5 times makes 160000. This number multiplied by 1,74110112, the figures in the table corresponding to 20, the remainder, will give 278576,17920000. The descendants, then, from the original settlers are, on the supposition made, 278576; and they are in proportion to the whole inhabitants, as 278576 is to 400000.</p>

And each of these duplications, being multiplied by the several lines of figures in the table, will give the amount of the Americans in the intermediate years.— Their present number being estimated at two millions and an half, their duplications will be as follows,
