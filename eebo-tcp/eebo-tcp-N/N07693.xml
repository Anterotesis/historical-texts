            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE civility and frankneſs, which I could not help thinking carried ſomething of friendſhip in it, with which you uſed me, during our ſhort acquaintaince, has kept me from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forgeting you, ſince I ſaw you; nor have I forgot the repeated requeſt you made me, before I left your place: Without hindering you then with apologies for my delay, I ſhall now begin to anſwer it.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian, ſay we, in oppoſition to all the various ways wherein men ſeek to pleaſe God, is perſuaded, upon divine authority, that GOD IS WELL PLEASED IN HIS BELOV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED SON: This we are taught by the voice that came from heaven: This is the great point <hi>proved</hi> by the reſurrection of Jeſus, as
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009824_0003_0F7A5291278781C0"/>
being the point in diſpute before he died, upon which he was by the Jews condemned to death; and upon which both ſides ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to heaven for deciſion. It was no part of the diſpute, whether Jeſus, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling himſelf the SON OF GOD, ſignified himſelf to be truly and properly God. All parties concerned, friends and foes, were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon this: For under this title Jeſus claimed equal honour with the Father; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this title the beliving Jews worſhiped him, and aſcribed the divine perfections unto him, even at a time when nothing was more zealouſly maintained among the Jews, than the worſhiping of one God only. Upon his aſſuming this title, the unbelieving Jews ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him of blaſphemy; becauſe, ſaid they, he being a man, maketh himſelf God: and in another place, becauſe he ſaid, that God was his Father, making himſelf equal with God; while at the ſame time, however much they lay at the catch with his words, they never charged him with preaching up more gods than one. 'Tis too late now then to alter the meaning of that title. The only diſpute then was, whether that title belonged to Jeſus; whether Jeſus was the beloved Son of God, in whom he is well pleaſed. This is the plain meaning and import of that fact, the <hi>reſurrection of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:009824_0004_0F7A5291B57D67B8"/>As Jeſus came into the world not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for any ſin of his own, being without ſin, but, as he declares himſelf, to give his life a ranſom for many; ſo God, in raiſing him from the dead, gave the higheſt demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his being well pleaſed with the ranſom which he gave: And as Jeſus put the truth of all that he ſaid, upon the iſſue of his being raiſed again from the dead, which you ſee his enemies alſo were appriſed of; his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, by this means, muſt turn out to be the higheſt proof of the divine aſſent to every thing he ſpoke.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Apoſtles, in purſuance of their commiſſion to preach that Goſpel, upon which eternal life hinged, every where bare witneſs to this fact, and made it their firſt and chief buſineſs to perſuade men of it: and when they had got men perſuaded of it, their continual care about them was, that they might keep it in memory, (1 Cor. xv. 2. and 2 Tim. ii. 8.) and to ſerve this great purpoſe were the various obſervances, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles delivered unto the churches to keep. This is the firſt principle, the great axiom of Chriſtianity, from which we find the apoſtles continually inferring almoſt every thing that we are called to believe or do in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion.</p>
            <p>From <hi>this</hi> a Chriſtian draws his firſt taſte of that joy which is man's proper life in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009824_0005_0F7A529281CB2AE0"/>
from the brutes. This keeps him, like his pole ſtar from groping in the dark, after every idle gueſs, ſtarted by the wiſe and the learned, about virtue and happineſs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſeeking, like other men, to pleaſe God by any qualification he has or hopes to attain, he is perſuaded that God is already well pleaſed in his beloved Son; that every thing needful to recommend him to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour, was compleated by Jeſus on the croſs, when he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> and gave up the ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This</hi> is the influencing principle, the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing line of his life: This leads him to love God and keep his commandments. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to his deads of greateſt ſelf denial ariſe directly from <hi>this.</hi> His perſuaſion, that the character of Jeſus was ſo amiable in the eye of God, as to procure his favour to the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, draws him to imitate that character; for 'tis plain, he that ſays he believes <hi>this,</hi> and does not make conſcience of imitating Jeſus, tells a lie. A Chriſtian then is led in that path of virtue, which is in the higheſt repute with God; tho', as was examplified in Jeſus, the true ſtandard of it, it will never be the path to honor in this world. And he is moved forward by that principle, which of all others draws the heart of man with greateſt pleaſure, gratitude: So he toils not in the fruitleſs taſk
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009824_0006_0F7A5293397778B8"/>
of making out a title to the divine favour; but his obedience is a continued expreſſion of thanks to God for the free gift of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which he ſent his Son to work, and which he finiſhed on the croſs, as a full title to the divine favour for the guiltieſt of mankind.</p>
            <p>This truth, believed on its proper evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, gives ſuch a daſh to the natural pride of his own underſtanding, that he can no more truſt his reaſonings about God and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs <hi>a priori;</hi> ſo he learns his character of God, and his own ſituation with reſpect to him, wholly from this fact. This forms his judgment about mankind and about himſelf, alters his mind entirely as to every thing he formerly thought valuable about himſelf in the ſight of God, or gave him any prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to others in that repect; ſo keeps him from looking upon any of mankind with an air importing, ſtand by.</p>
            <p>This directs him in the choice of his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends, and is the meaſure and rule of his friendſhip with them: And, if he have friends in other repects, his fonder with in their behalf is, that they knew and believed this truth: He wiſhes, I ſay, for he knows he cannot perſuade, nor contribute any thing to the obtaining of his wiſh; even as he knows he did not contribute any thing himſelf to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009824_0007_0F7A5293F03E28A0"/>
his obtaining any comfortable apprehenſion of this truth; yea, whatever pains might have been taken with himſelf, and however morally ſerious he might formerly have been, he ſees plainly that the aim of his mind, in his moſt ſincere endeavours that way, lay in direct oppoſition to the plain import of that f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, that, however plain the external evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence be, the fact is of ſuch a nature, as to require more than human teſtimony to give us a certain undoubting perſuaſion of it. We can firmly rely upon human teſtimony, as to events that fall out in the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but as, in the reſurrection of the dead, the courſe of nature is reverſed; and as the reſurrection of Jeſus is ſo circumſtanced, as to decide a point of the higheſt importance and moſt intereſting nature, in oppoſition to the reaſonings of all mankind; there is need in this caſe for more than the teſtimony of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, or ſet of men, to reſt the firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of our minds upon: There is need here for divine teſtimony, divine evidence, to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009824_0008_0F7A5294EF0431A0"/>
our belief. For as to what kind of credit theſe people may give to it, to whom it is a matter of no moment whether it be true or not, I have no occaſion to take notice of that here. And if we rate the believers of this fact on its proper evidence, by their appearing well affected to the plain ſimple ſcripture meaning of it, their numbers will turn out to be but ſmall, and rarely to be found in the Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p>If you enquire, what is the nature of this divine evidence? I anſwer, firſt, it is very ſimple and forcible, as all the ways whereby God correſponds with men are: For inſtance, when one retires a moment, and caſts his eyes round upon the magnificent frame of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the earth, his mind is ſtruck with an awful apprehenſion of a grand contriver, the great Creator and former of all things: ſo, with reſpect to the ſcripture account of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus, when one perceives the divine evidence of it, his mind is ſtruck with a view of ſuch a grand contrivance, that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced none but God could be the author of it. But more particularly:</p>
            <p>When man, who is diſtinguiſhed from the brutes by his conſcience, and whoſe proper life lies in a ſenſe of God's fovour, allows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an interval from thoſe functions that are common to him with other animals, and acts
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009824_0009_0F7A5295DFA26F38"/>
in his diſtinguiſhed character, examining how matters ſtand betwixt his creator and him; his conſcience muſt be convinced that God is an infinitely good being, ſo as oppoſite to all evil as he is good; of which the pain that ariſes in the mind of man, when he does evil, is a ſtrong proof. This pain is man's proper death, which he ſhuns more than all other evils. The more he thinks on God, his pain encreaſes. When he looks abroad upon the inflexible oppoſition of the Almighty to all ſin, he muſt conclude, ſeeing the Almighty is againſt me, who can be for me? All the creation cannot help here! He is ſurrounded with impoſſibilities on all hands as to any way of relief: He finds himſelf mortally wounded by the ſtroke of the Almighty, and ſo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable by any inferior hand. He is torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the impoſſibility he finds of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that queſtion, How ſhall God be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
            <p>That beam of divine wiſdom, which ſhines in man's conſcience, diſcovering his ſin, is the very kindler of his miſery; and that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which gave m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his being and proper life, appears armed for his ruin: For ſurely no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but that of God can hurt a life that lies in his favour: So divine <hi>wiſdom</hi> and divine <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ſtand the <hi>objectors.</hi> Therefore,</p>
            <p>That <hi>anſwer,</hi> which can fairly ſatisfy and heal the mind of man, thus pained and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009824_0010_0F7A52965DA2CEA8"/>
without diminiſhing in the leaſt his aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conviction of God's inflexible oppoſition to ſin, muſt, in the nature of the thing, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry its own evidence of coming from the infinitely good, wiſe and powerful Being; who created man, ſpeaks in his conſcience, made his life to lie in his favour; ſo could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone deprive him of that life, and alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it to him when loſt.

So,</p>
            <p>While I repreſent divine wiſdom and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as objecting againſt ſinful man's happineſs, and again providing a full ſatisfying anſwer to the objection, you muſt not think that I point out theſe divine perfections as in the leaſt variable, or not perfe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:009824_0011_0F7A52971450E1C8"/>Now, this is the very caſe with the goſpel: The goſpel contains all that can be wiſhed for in ſuch an healing anſwer, to great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that by means which it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have entered into the heart of man, or of any creature to deviſe; and which manifeſt a power not inferior to that which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the world into being from nothing: So the goſpel is the wiſdom and the power of God, to ſave every one who believes it. It ſets before us the inflexible oppoſition of the Almighty to all ſin, fully expreſſed in the death of Chriſt: ſo, to uſe the ſcripture words, the <hi>anſwer of a good conſcience towards God,</hi> is <hi>by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, who is gone into Heaven and is on the right hand of God.</hi> Here the character of the true God ſhines forth before the eyes of a ſinner, thus deſcribed in his own words, <hi>See now that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me; I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal, neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</hi> And in another place, <hi>They have no knowledge, that ſet up—and pray unto a God that cannot ſave—there is no God beſide me, a juſt God and a Saviour, there is none beſide me; look unto me and be ye ſaved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none elſe.</hi>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:009824_0012_0F7A5297C84785A8"/>But further, to ſhew the neceſſity there is for ſome ſuch evidence as I have been ſpeaking of it muſt be conſidered, that when a man's mind is heartily pinched upon a queſtion, that lies wholly betwixt God and his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he then finds he needs ſomething to be ſaid on the part of God to eaſe his mind; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of greater authority and weight than the beſt connected chain of philoſophic rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, or the moſt authentic tradition: And it cannot be denied, that God may ſo ſhew himſelf in what he ſays, as fully to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the hearer, that it is he that ſpeaks; and ſuch a conviction the hearers of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had, 1 Theſſ. ii. 14. So much then for the nature of the Chriſtian truth, and its peculiar evidence.</p>
            <p>But the great difficulty ſtill remains: If this evidence lies quite plain and open in the bible before every one that reads or hears it, why does not every one perceive it? why cannot one man lay it ſo before another, as to make it ſtrike him, as he may a propoſition of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid?</p>
            <p>In anſwer to this, I ſatisfy myſelf by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that as this truth as recorded in the bible, carrying its peculiar evidence along with it, preſents a new idea of God, which our minds by their original conſtitution were not framed to take in; and which man, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009824_0013_0F7A5298823F41A0"/>
his righteouſneſs, could have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for; it is therefore neceſſary that that ſame power, which at firſt framed the mind of man for taking in its <hi>preſent</hi> ideas, ſhould put hand to it afreſh, and make it capable of admitting this <hi>new</hi> one; which, in ſhort, is this, God conſtituting and making a ſinner a righteous perſon, as neceſſary to the enjoying his favour and eternal life, and yet appearing perfectly juſt in doing ſo.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe you will think now, that by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to get out of one difficutty, I have fallen into a greater. You will ſay, at this rate, man is, by his very conſtitution led to reject the goſpel: And this is indeed what I affirm. For man, by his original conſtitution, was made to live by his own righteouſneſs; and while he retained this, his conſtitution was certainly well ſuited to his happineſs, and he then could have no occaſion for any ſuch thing as the goſpel: So his natural idea of God could be no other but this, that he is juſt in juſtifying the righteous, and in condemning the tranſgreſſor. And while he ſtood righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

juſt in juſtifying the ungodly, or making them righteous; ſo fit for that enjoyment. But this new idea of God cannot be had from nature, but from the goſpel; where God makes a new diſcovery of himſelf, acting above and beyond the ſphere of nature altogether; yea reverſing the courſe thereof, raiſing the dead, and calling thoſe things that be not, as though they were.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe one ſhould be educated from a child, and promoted by a great and wealthy trading company to be their principal mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and truſtee with a penſion of ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands a year: and after he has lived many years ſplendidly in this office, he ſhould at length forfeit all his wealth and his honor with the company, by groſs unfaithfulneſs to his truſt: would not his remaining taſte for that honorable high life, which he had ſo long held by his integrity, make it almoſt impoſſible for him to beg, or even to exſpect ſubſiſtence by alms from any of the company? would he not rather chuſe to make any kind of ſhift for himſelf in ſome remote place, where he ſhould never be ſeen by any of them? This ſimilitude may ſerve to ſignify, tho' indeed very imperfectly, the natural e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrangment of ſinful man's heart from God; and the ſtrong biaſs which his orignal conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution muſt give him againſt the goſpel.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:009824_0015_0F7A529A467DE550"/>When man became a ſinner, his natural propenſity to live by his own righteouſneſs, which he had now loſt, and could by no means repair, behoved to be criminal, as it leads him to think ſo diſhonorably of God, as to imagine that he can be pleaſed with an imperfect righteouſneſs, or a righteouſneſs ſtained with ſin; whereas his original appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of God behoved to be, that he could be pleaſed with nothing ſhort of pefect ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs obedience; of which he ſoon had an awful proof, in God's condemning all mankind to death for one ſingle tranſgreſſion, and that not of what is commonly called a moral, but of a poſitive precept. To the ſame purpoſe we may yet find another abiding teſtimony among mankind, from the pain that ariſes in the mind of a man upon the commiſſion of one ſingle ſin; and from the ſuſpicious fear, which haunts thoſe who have the beſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters among men, when they ſeriouſly think of their ſituation with reſpect to God, that ſomething more than they have yet done is needful to pleaſe him: A remarkable inſtance of which you have in that young gentleman, of a moſt amiable character among men; who, with regard to the laws that reſpect human ſociety, could ſay, <hi>All theſe things have I keept from my youth up:</hi> yet, when he ſeriouſly thought of eternal life, this natural

And tho' conſcience ſtill finds fault, and looks with a ſuſpicious diſtruſtful eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that is doing: yet, as it knows not, ſo cannot point out a better way; it is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to give place unto <hi>reaſonings</hi> on the ſide of the natural propenſity, as the only means left to keep from deſpair.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſonings then muſt be very cogent, as they are on the ſide of our conſtitution, and ſupported by the firſt and ſtrongeſt principle in our nature, ſelf preſervation.</p>
            <p>As the firſt buſineſs of theſe reaſonings is to frame a new character of God ſuitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their main tendency, againſt which if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience offer to object, it is put off with this, that it cannot preſent a more comfortable one; ſo, according to the ſcripture, the whole ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enation of the heart of man from God, and its oppoſition to the goſpel, is conducted by theſe reaſonings. Jeſus Chriſt, giving a ſum of the evils which proceed out of the heart of man, gives theſe the firſt rank; out of the heart proceedeth evil reaſonings. What are

Of this you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Paul's extraordinary converſion as a kind of emblematical repreſentation. A ſight of Jeſus, alive from the dead, at once confuted all his ſchemes, and changed the man. The
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009824_0022_0F7A529F3871DFF8"/>
belief of what he ſaw, works the ſame effect to the end of the world: For it is the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcripture maxim, that <hi>the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, is by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and, <hi>let every one that nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity.</hi> Solomon ſays, the ſpirit of a man will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain his infirmity, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear? And experience ſhews, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience thoroughly wounded with a ſenſe of the divine diſpleaſure, is man's intolerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, his proper death; which pains him more than the fear of returning to duſt. Now, if this be an evil beyond the power of man to provide a cure for, and God, in his ſovereign mercy, was pleaſed to diſcover himſelf in ſome new work for this purpoſe; is it not very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all this, that the whole conveyance and application of this diſcovery, this cure, ſhould be under the ſpecial direction, and by the ſpecial concurrence, of that ſovereign mercy which provided it? It can throw no reflection then againſt this truth, that every one does not perceive and admit the divine evidence of it. For what if ſome do not believe, ſhall their unbelief make the faith or veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God of none effect? Far be it! yea, their obſtinate reſiſting of its evidence, to their own perdition, while many of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell moſt of thoſe who embrace it in every

natural endowment, ſerves, as a part of the divine ſcheme, to aggrandize the happineſs of the ſons of mercy, and to be an eternal proof to them, that ſovereign mercy alone made the difference; even as the hatred and oppoſition of the enemies of the truth, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prepare the lovers thereof for their happineſs, by giving occaſion for the exerciſe of thoſe virtues, which are peculiar to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; wherein they muſt all be conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Captain of their ſalvation, who was made perfect through ſufferings. However many then perſiſt in loving darkneſs, rather than the light, becauſe their deeds are evil; ſtill it holds true, that the goſpel is the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God and the wiſdom of God, to ſave e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who believes it: It ſtrikes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the moſt ſimple and forcible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, even as the conviction of ſin does, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving at once every objection that can ariſe from that conviction; and ſo fairly ſhews it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the voice of him, who ſpeaks in the natural conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian truth, being once admited in the conſcience on its proper evidence, becomes as it were a new <hi>inſtinct</hi> in man, by which his friendly correſpondence with his Creator is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. <hi>This</hi> leads him as a clew into the meaning and ſcope of the ſcriptures; ſhews him the admirable harmony and connection
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009824_0024_0F7A52A0C41B1620"/>
of them, as they all contribute to eſtabliſh him in the perſuaſion of, and form his mind into a ſuitableneſs unto that wherein his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs lies. He reads the ſcriptures, as one well affected to the great ſcope and deſign of them; ſo is not eaſily induced to hearken to ſuch as would put a ſenſe on words or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in oppoſition to the leading deſign.</p>
            <p>All the commands and inſtitutions of the New Teſtament, are directed to conſciences endowed with this inſtinct, and are in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner adapted for the ſervice thereof: So the apoſtle John, writing an epiſtle to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the new commandment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian brotherly love, ſays, <hi>I have not written unto you becauſe ye know not the truth, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This new inſtinct gives a man a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and eſteem for all the ſayings of Him, who came into the world to teſtify and accompliſh the ſaying truth; leads him to ſit at the feet of Jeſus and hear his word, and, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting, to do juſt as he is bid.

               </gap>ow and love one another: For the cheriſhing of <hi>this</hi> the whole Chriſtian church order is framed. The chief buſineſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their aſſembling together, in their preaching, in their brotherly exhortations, to their diſcipline, in their mutual ſervice one in
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:009824_0025_0F7A52A16B5B3E40"/>
another, is to promote and ſtrengthen this, and to check the oppoſite propenſity; which, as it is natural and deeply rooted in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, is always by freſh reaſonings ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the aſcendant, and ſo cuts out freſh work for Chriſtians, and gives them continual oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to exerciſe themſelves, in handling the apoſtolic weapons for defeating them.</p>
            <p>Seeing it is plain from the New Teſtament, that every thing in a ſociety of Chriſtians muſt be done by a free conſcientious unanimity, and no point carried by majority of voices, or driven by the influence of party or faction, as is the caſe in all worldly ſocieties: if then you would have me to account for the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of a Chriſtian church, in the many caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es wherein their agreement is ſo neceſſary for the maintaining of fervent charity, I can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it to nothing elſe but this inſtin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the prayer of him who ſaid, <hi>I pray for all that ſhall believe on me through the word of the apoſtles, that they may be one:</hi> And for my own part I can ſay, that I have been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuch unanimity in many inſtances, as I could not account for any other way; and which yourſelf, I dare ſay, had you been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, behoved at leaſt to aſcribe to ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncommon ſpring. Such an unanimity muſt appear liable to many objections, and be even impracticable in any ſociety not gathered
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009824_0026_0F7A52A231872748"/>
and cemented together by this inſtinct. And indeed I look upon it as the great ſtanding ſign, appearance, or viſible repreſentation of the union ſpoken of in the 17th ch. of John, and accordingly one of the principle eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, if not the moſt ſtriking proof of the truth of Chriſtianity: This is plainly intimated twice in that chapter; firſt in ver. 21. <hi>That they all may be one, &amp;c. that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me:</hi> And then in ver. 23. <hi>That they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> The Chriſtian unanimity correſponds to the New Teſtament, as a map does to the geographical grammar, and the appearance of it is one great thing that gives meaning and force to the preached goſpel.</p>
            <p>I cannot well conclude without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of another grand obſtacle, which the goſpel has to overcome, in finding its way into the heart of man, and which is as firmly rooted in our conſtitution as the former, and ſtands in the cloſeſt connection with it; and that is, the appetite for an earthly paradiſe, ſomething like what man originally enjoyed as the proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his own righteouſneſs, which his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was fitted for, and which he forfeited by his tranſgreſſion. It is true, man's proper life was a ſenſe of God's favour; yet it was in theſe delightful enjoyments, prepared for
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:009824_0027_0F7A52A2EDC5CDD0"/>
him in paradiſe, that he experienced that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: The divine ſmile upon his food and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earthly enjoyments, gave them that pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar exquiſite reliſh, which other animals, not having his peculiar taſte, could not find in the like. And tho' man has long ſince loſt both his righteouſneſs and paradiſe together, yet in ſinful miſerable man, the diſpoſion ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to join ſome ſhadow of both theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. How bewitchingly are the ſtories of virtue rewarded dreſt up before our eyes? and the virtues chiefly recommended to us, and extolled by our wiſe men, are ſuch as either aim at, or ſhine beſt in what is called high Life; ſo we are told, <hi>virtutibus obſtat res an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſta domi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the goſpel does not ſet before us the proſpect of being re-inſtated into ſuch an earthly happineſs as man once held by his own righteouſneſs, but a much more glorious life, the proper reward of the Son of God, for his humbling himſelf and becoming obedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the death; a ſpiritual and heavenly life, to take place by a reſurrection from the dead: And in order to the full enjoyment of which, the conſtitution of man muſt be changed, and whereof he can only have the hope and foretaſte to comfort himſelf with in his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſtate: So the virtues, by which the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel calls true Chriſtians to be chiefly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009824_0028_0F7A52A5813D3ED8"/>
are ſuch as will never be reliſhed by the world, even thoſe that ſhined in Jeſus.</p>
            <p>It muſt likewiſe be conſidered, that this happineſs, this new life from the dead, is of ſuch a nature as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to form a conception of it. We have no principles in our minds, nor any thing that affects our ſenſes to draw a compariſon from, by which we can frame any idea of it. For, however delicately a man may imagine about happineſs, and however high he may raiſe his idea of it: ſtill his moſt abſtracted thoughts will never riſe higher than ſome refinement upon earthly bliſs. Hence alſo ariſes the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity that the mind of man ſhould be touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afreſh by the finger of God, in order to his having ſome idea of, and reliſh for, this new life from the dead, theſe pleaſures that are at the right hand of God for ever; even as the ſame divine energy was neceſſary to his knowing the <hi>juſt God</hi> and the <hi>Saviour,</hi> the name by which the true God diſtinguiſhes himſelf from all others. Tho' we may thus diſtinguiſh theſe things, yet they iſſue in one and the ſame, and are accordingly put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſcripture. <hi>This is life eternal, that they may know the, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent;</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>This is the true God and eternal life; little children, keep yourſelves from idols.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:009824_0029_0F7A52A67519E710"/>Chriſtianity then, as it calls a man off from the fruitleſs taſk of eſtabliſhing his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, to be juſtified by the faith of Chriſt; ſo it calls a man off from the purſuit of an earthly happineſs, which at beſt iſſues in death, to look for glory, honor and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, in fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, in the reſurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p>You will now ask me, how is a man act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a criminal part in rejecting the goſpel, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it reveals things, whereof he has natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no idea? In anſwer to this I ſhall only ſay, that he acts a criminal part in inſiſting on theſe objections, which are the real<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> round of his diſaffection to the goſpel; that is, he is a criminal in pretending to pleaſe God by his own righteouſneſs, while he is conſcious that he is a ſinner; and in purſuing an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happineſs as its reward, while his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt tell him, he has forfeited that, and is guilty of death: So he is a criminal in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry at the goſpel, becauſe it aſſerts and enforces the verdict of his conſcience in both theſe reſpects; and ſo far carries its own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of having come from that ſame God who ſpeaks there.</p>
            <p>I own at the ſame time that I believe no man will ever give up with <hi>theſe,</hi> till he find a better righteouſneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to anſwer but this, that God hath mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will have mercy; and that God's choice is of grace, and not according to works: ſo differs from that of man, which always proceeds upon ſome difference, ſome fitneſs in one thing to be choſen, more than in that which is rejected.</p>

            <head>THE CONVERSION OF JONATHAN THE JEW, As related by himſelf.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AD Jeſus, when buried like other mortals, remained in the grave, I had ſtedfaſtly adhered to the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, and gloried in being one of them, as being convinced, that the grand controverſy about righteouſneſs, which was carried on with great zeal on both ſides, was now fairly decided in their favour, and that they had gained an aditional honor by the oppoſition.</p>
            <p>I received a liberal and virtuous education among the Sadducees, who admit no ſenſe of our ſacred writings but what they think agreeable to ſound philoſophy. But happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about the time that Jeſus made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, to fall acquainted with ſome ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009824_0033_0F7A52AE4E3E7818"/>
men of eminent piety among the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, I began to conceive a liking to their party. I obſerved, that they maintained a more ſtrict temperance, and, in general, a greater purity of life, and that they had more exalted ſentiments about the power and cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racter of God, than the other party. I made it my buſineſs now to attend their lectures, and ſtudy their tenets, in hopes of being found worthy to rank with them. Mean time, the uncommon oppoſition ſhewn to them by Jeſus drew no ſmall ſhare of my attention, and ſerved, on the whole, rather to increaſe than diminiſh my attachment to them. I conſidered their ſentiments as a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of my former way of thinking, and highly conducive to my advancement in virtue as well as piety. I readily judged, then, that the oppoſition which was chiefly pointed againſt what came neareſt to perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, behoved to flow from the worſt of cauſes.</p>
            <p>I had a very low opinion of Jeſus, as well as of the company he kept, on many accounts, which I ſhall not now take time to relate. In the general, I thought him a ſtranger to every great and noble ſentiment which charms and elevates the mind of man. What diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me moſt to him was, I thought him uncharitable to the laſt degree. I could not

            <p>I muſt own indeed, that there was a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar energy in the rebukes of Jeſus, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:009824_0036_0F7A52AFE9C94018"/>By the ſame principles, I fortified myſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the prediction delivered by Jeſus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his riſing again from the dead; to which event he had openly appealed for proof of his doctrine; or, which is the ſame thing, the excellency of his perſon and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: and what ſerved to give me the greater aſſurance was, I found my favourite party was very forward to refer the deciſion of the whole controverſy to that ſame event, as being very confident that it would never happen.</p>
            <p>When once Jeſus was dead and buried, I thought the diſpute as good as ended. But how great was my aſtoniſhment! when, not long after, thoſe poor illeterate men, who had been the companions of Jeſus, appeared pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly, teſtifying with uncommon boldneſs, that he had riſen again from the dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his prediction; that they were well aſſured of this by many infallible tokens, and that at laſt they ſaw him aſcend into heaven; when I ſaw that no threatnings, no infamy, no puniſhment, could intimidate them;—when, moreover, I obſerved ſo many undeniable proofs of ſupernatural power, co-operating with them, and exerted in the name of Jeſus, as riſen from the dead.—Then the late won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works of Jeſus, before his death, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred upon my thoughts.—The former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions

I had been at ſo much pains to ſtifle, revived afreſh upon me.—In ſhort, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence crowded ſo faſt upon me from every quarter, I found there was no gain ſaying it.</p>
            <p>But ſtill I was averſe to the laſt degree to admit it. I was ſhocked at the train of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which behoved to follow. And thus I queſtioned with myſelf, Has reaſon itſelf deceived me? Do all our beſt books of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and morality proceed upon falſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? Muſt I give up with my choiceſt ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Is there no ſuch thing as wiſdom or righteouſneſs in the world!

And it well correſponded thereto in its effects: for it proved ſufficient to raiſe the dead, and give hope to the deſperate.—The fact and its import, the <hi>hand-writing</hi> and the <hi>interpretation,</hi> equally became the majeſty of him who is the <hi>Supreme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſaw plainly, that in the reſurrection of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, there behoved to be the agency of a <hi>power</hi> ſuperior to the power of nature, even capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to controul and reverſe the courſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: therefore I concluded, that this operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>power</hi> was greater than the God of the Sadducees and the philoſophers. I found al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that this <hi>power</hi> had a <hi>peculiar character,</hi> manifeſt from the nature of the controverſy, wherein it interpoſed its agency and gave de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. I found, by the deciſion, that its charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was more grand and perfect, as well as its agency ſtronger, than that of the God of the Phariſees. As to its agency, it was able to raiſe from deeper miſery to higher bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs than the Phariſees thought of. As to its character, it appeared with unlimited ſovereignty <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> in perfection. Whereas the God of the Phariſees was ſuch onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> partially, and by halves; incapable to execute the threatened curſe againſt every ſin, and yet ſhew mercy and boundleſs favour to the tranſgreſſors, not ſo juſt as to maintain the honor, the ſpirit, and extent of the perfect law, at all events; nor ſo merciful, as to have
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:009824_0040_0F7A52B2C36BEE48"/>
any favour for the uttetly worthleſs and wretched: but, halving the matter, merciful to men of good repute, and juſt in accepting thoſe who are deficient in their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or, in another view, juſt in exacting the debt of five hundred pence, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in forgiving that of fifty; or ſhewing ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice only againſt the utterly inſolvent, and mercy only to thoſe who can make partial payment;—in ſhort, (like all created poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates), incapable of appearing, at once, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out limitation of either attribute, juſt and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful in perfection.</p>
            <p>I found then that the power which operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the reſurrection of Jeſus, excelled not only in ſtrength, but alſo in majeſty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of character, all that was called God among men. So I perceived no ſmall propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in the ſaying of Jeſus, <hi>O righteous father, the world hath not known thee.</hi>—I concluded then that this <hi>power</hi> is the only true God: for that which is <hi>greateſt</hi> muſt be God. Thus am I called off from every idol, however high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignified, whether the work of mens hands, or of their imaginations, to adore him who is <hi>higher than the higheſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I frankly acknowledge, then, that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or my hope toward God, is <hi>not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on argument,</hi> not on the wiſdom of men, but on the <hi>power of God;</hi>—not on any deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

            <p>This fact, firm as a rock, emboldens me to pay an equal regard to philoſophical gueſſes and enthuſiaſtical fancies. If any one, then, ſhould ask me a reaſon of the hope that is in me. I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As this divine character can no where be publiſhed but along with the fact, I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, by hearing the <hi>grandeſt character</hi> thence ariſing, that the fact muſt be true.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009824_0043_0F7A52B4F2A95858"/>
For to ſuppoſe, that the bare notion or idea of ought greater than God could ever be any where imagined, would be the wildeſt of all abſurdities. And it is very evident, that that view of God, which, the lower it abaſes the pride of man, raiſes his comfort and joy the higher; which reduces man to the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerved or to <hi>extreme</hi> dependance, while it exalts him to the <hi>ſummit</hi> of all happineſs; could never be the contrivance of man, whoſe ſtrongeſt impulſe is toward the gratifying of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> pride, and whoſe joy naturally riſes or ſinks according to the ſucceſs thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when the fact and its import are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to my knowledge by the ſame teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I have no room to doubt, that God, who alone can deſcribe his own character, is the teſtifyer and declarer of both. And ſurely it would be extremely abſurd to ſuppoſe, that ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Again, It is from this fact that the amiable character of the juſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

without furniſhing me with any new ones, lands me in atheiſm, in chaos, and utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Whereas the account of it given by the witneſſes, while it proves all my former wiſdom to be fooliſhneſs, opens to me a new and more delightful ſource of knowledge, throwing light upon a thouſand facts that I could never account for before; ſhewing me a no leſs wonderful than ſatisfactory proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in all the extraordinary circumſtances at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the birth, life, death, and reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus, and the miniſtry of his witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.—It throws light upon all the ancient ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writings, and the extraordinary facts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in them from the creation downward. It ſets my mind at reſt, as to all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about the divine character, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of man, which occaſionally pinched me before.—I am now reconciled to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of ſin and death into the world, and the whole dark ſide of things, on account of the marvelous light that ſhines forth from the greateſt darkneſs.—I am now reconciled to the ſhade, on account of the magnificent pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thence ariſing to my view, and which could not otherwiſe have appeared. In a word, I thence perceive a no leſs amiable than grand uniformity of deſign, in all the works of God from firſt to laſt. Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am fully ſatisfied, then, in agreement with the witneſſes, to hold the meaning they have given of the reſurrection of Jeſus, for the <hi>goſpel,</hi> the <hi>word,</hi> and the <hi>teſtimony</hi> of God; and to call it, by way of eminence, THE TRUTH, in oppoſition to every falſe gloſs on the ſcriptures, and every falſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the light or law of nature, or about any of the works or ways of God.

I dare give free ſcope to my conſcience, before God, and look into his perfect law, as knowing, that, however heavy the charge turn out againſt me, the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus affords the anſwer of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience toward God, as it ſhews a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be already finiſhed, by which God can appear juſt in juſtifying me, even in the very worſt view I can have of myſelf, or, which is more even in the worſt view I can appear in before him, who knows all things. By being thus encouraged to look into the perfect law of liberty, and continue therein, I ſee the extent of it to be vaſtly wider than I was hitherto willing to notice. And, by ſeeing what a righteoſneſs was requiſite to honor it, and at what an expence every the leaſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of it behoved to be expiated, I am led to hold every precept of it more ſacred than ever I did before.

But it came to me, unexpectedly, from heaven, by ſupernatural revelation; that is, when I heard God, by the mouths of the witneſſes, laying open the meaning of a ſupernatural fact; a fact that had not only awakened freſh diſturbance in my conſcience, but alſo demoliſhed all my arguments.</p>

The goſpel, while it enforces the law of God, and makes the conſcience more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the conviction of ſin, conveys likewiſe the moſt refreſhing remedy; ſo anſwers to the majeſty of the living and true God, who ſays, Deut. xxxii. 29. <hi>See now that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there is there any that can deliver out of my hand.

            <p>Nor do I think I have any apology to make to men, for renouncing my former <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>thoughts,</hi> however tighteous they appeared to myſelf and others, upon my being found guilty, beyond reply, by <hi>the one lawgiver, who is able to ſave and to deſtroy;</hi> and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated

to be <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>unrighteous</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of both, by his irreſiſtable work and teſtimony, I do not think it beneath the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the wiſeſt human creature, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of his miſtake, by him, whom it well becomes to ſay,—<hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</hi> (See Iſaiah, lv. 7, 8, 9,)</p>
            <p>I uſed to admire it as a fine imagination, that were truth and virtue to be preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes in all their native charms, the beauteous ſplendor would be too tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, too dazling to be beheld by us, but through ſome vail.—The experiment has been tried, and that in a manner far ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the reach of fancy. The unſullied per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of both has appeared in the world, in all their native charms indeed, yet ſo as not to hurt the weakeſt eye.—But what was the reſult? we ſaw no form nor comelineſs in him; no beauty, that we ſhould deſire him. We turned aſide our faces from him, as from a diſagreeable object. The moſt wiſe and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous among us were the foremoſt to ſet him at nought.—Yet however ſtrange it may ſeem, true it is, that ſome of the moſt baſe and ſtupid among us were, upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:009824_0052_0F7A52BBB57DAE08"/>
ſtruck with ſuch an apprehenſion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine beauty, as far exceeds all the raptures of imagination. <hi>The WORD was made fleſh,</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>and dwelt among us, (and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father) full of grace and truth.</hi>

            <p>I have ſaid, the reſurrection of Jeſus ſerves me, as a new principle of knowledge or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. I do not ſet out from conjectures to inquire after truth; but I ſet out with the light of undoubted truth, to obſerve what path it opens for me to walk in. I do not ſet out from human maxims or preſumptions, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire how I ſhall form a god to myſelf; but I ſet out from heavenly truth, ſtamped with the divine character, to inquire how I ſhall form my heart and life ſuitably to it. I do not ſet out upon the inquiry, What I ſhall do to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Divine Majeſty? or, as the phraſe is, How I ſhall make up my peace with God? but I ſet out from the perſuaſion, that God is juſt in juſtifying the ungodly, to inquire, what ſervice he has for me,—to prove what is the good, and acceptable, and perfct will of God.</p>
            <p>All my religious principles and practices are ſo many inferences from the afore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned fact; yet I have no ground to value myſelf as a <hi>reaſoner,</hi> even on this new footing. For I could find no ſatisfactory meaning at all in that fact, till I was firſt taught it by the

               </gap>lile us. And, what is more, I can deduce no inference from thence, till I be firſt taught it by one or other of the inſpired wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. But when I hear them diſplaying the manifold wiſdom of God from that ſource, perceive a wonderful propriety and force in the whole of their reaſoning. Thus God ſee meet to abuſe my pride of underſtanding, by the very means he uſes for conveying to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
