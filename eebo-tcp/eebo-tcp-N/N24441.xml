            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CONFESSION AND Dying Speech of Peter Porcupine, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I WAS born in Old England; my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father was a day labourer. He died before I was born; but I often ſlept beneath the ſame roof that ſheltered him, and where his widow dwelt for ſeveral years after his death. It was a little thatched cottage with a garden before the door. Here I and my brothers went every Chriſtmas and Whitſuntide to ſpend a week or two, and <hi>torment</hi> the poor old woman with our noiſe and <hi>dilapidations.</hi> Such was my propenſity to vice, that I could not reſiſt the temptation to <hi>pilfer</hi> even from my grandmother. In this I diſcovered a baſeneſs and a depravity which rogues diſavow; for they make it a point of honour not to ſteal from each other. My grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father was no philoſopher—alas! it would have been well for me if he had been; for then his
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032353_0003_0FF1EEDBE5062E10"/>precepts as well as examples would have inſtilled principles into my mind, which would have preſerved me from the ignominous fate I am about to ſuffer. The legacies he left, were a large bundle of falſe keys, a pair of piſtols, a dagger and a maſque—The falſe keys he uſed to open locks with, which were not his own— the piſtols were employed to ſupport himſelf with on the highway—the dagger to put an enemy or a ſuſpected friend <hi>ſlily</hi> out of the way, and the maſque to keep himſelf from being known when he was engaged in any of his diurnal or nocturnal avocations.</p>
            <p>My father when I was born, was of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my grandfather—The reader will eaſily believe, from the purſuits of his parents, that he received no very brilliant education: he was however very <hi>ingenious</hi> for a man in his rank of life—When a little boy, he uſed to pilfer from other boys their chuckers, their marbles, and their tops, and theſe his earnings were appropriated to the expences of finiſhing an education which he had begun under a ſet of ſharpers, who held their nocturnal revels in a tavern in the neighbourhood. What theſe men could be expected to teach, he had learnt, and had beſides conſiderably improved himſelf in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032353_0004_0FF1EEDDB0139630"/>ſeveral other branches of the <hi>pad.</hi> He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſhop-lifting, pocket-picking, and ſeveral other branches of ſimilar ſciences well, and was often choſen to draw plans for ſucceſsful burg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary; in ſhort, he had the reputation among his kindred fellows, of poſſeſſing experience, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and dexterity, which never fails in <hi>England</hi> to give a man weight with thoſe of his own profeſſion.</p>
            <p>So much for my anceſtors: from whom, if I derive no honour, I have, alas! inherited a halter.</p>
            <p>I had, and I hope I yet have, three brothers— the eldeſt is a highwayman, the ſecond a pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocket, and the youngeſt, if alive, is in the ſervice of a ſet of money coiners. I was born on the ninth of March, 1766. The exact age of my brothers I have forgotten; but I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber having heard my mother ſay, that there was but three years and three quarters difference between the ages of the oldeſt and that of the youngeſt.</p>
            <p>A father like ours, it will be readily ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did not ſuffer us to eat the bread of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I do not remember the time when I did not earn my living. My firſt occupation was
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032353_0005_0FF1EEDF745402E8"/>in ſtealing <hi>potatoes, turnips</hi> and <hi>peas</hi> from the neighbours. When I firſt trudged a field with my ſmall bag and rum bottle ſwung over my ſhoulders, I was hardly able to climb the gates and ſtiles, and at the cloſe of the day to reach home, was a taſk of infinite difficulty. My next employment was ſtealing <hi>fowls, geeſe, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys</hi> and <hi>ducks. Picking pockets</hi> followed, and hence I arrived at the honour of joining a gang of burglars. My natural <hi>cowardice</hi> prevented me from taking to the highway. We were all of us liars and rogues, and my father uſed to boaſt that he had four boys, of whom the eldeſt was but fifteen years old, who did as much work as any three <hi>pick pockets</hi> in the pariſh of Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</p>
            <p>It would uſeleſs and unentertaining to dwell on the rogueries of a country boy; to lead the reader through gardens and fields, into hen-rooſts and hogſtyes, where I firſt gave ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of my ſkill; I ſhall, therefore, come at once to the epoch, that gave that turn to my future life, which at laſt brought me to the United States and to the gibbet.</p>
            <p>It was on the ſixth of May 1783, that I ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied forth to ſeek new adventures. I was dreſſed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032353_0006_0FF1EEE1561CEB50"/>in a ſuit of clothes, which had been purloined by one of my father's companions, in order to accompany two or three dames from a common ſtew to a fair; but inſtead of going to the fair, I tricked the laſſes and went to London. In this metropolis I amuſed myſelf in <hi>picking pockets</hi> and <hi>ſhop lifting,</hi> till I enliſted early in the year 1784, and as peace had then taken place, no great haſte was made to ſend recruits off to their regiments. The leiſure time I had after my enliſtment was ſpent in acquiring as much knowledge as would aid me in the ſucceſsful purſuits of getting money without labour, and in the courſe of one year which I devoted to it I learnt more than I had ever done before. My ambition excited in me a wiſh to be a leader among my brethren of the long fingered tribe, and unleſs I had more learning and more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity than any of them, I could not hope to be ſucceſsful. This ambition prompted me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote all my leiſure to books, and being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acute, I laid the foundation of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and thoſe talents, which I have ſince my arrival here, faithfully devoted to the ſervice of the king, my maſter. Before my departure for Nova Scotia I was promoted to the rank of a corporal. We ſet ſail from Graveſend, and after a ſhort paſſage arrived at Halifax in Nova
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032353_0007_0FF1EEE79B6E0C88"/>Scotia. We ſtaid but a few weeks in Nova Scotia, being ordered to St. John's and New Brunſwick. Here and at other places we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till the month of September 1791, when the regiment was relieved and ſent home. During my ſtay, however, in the new World, I again purſued the drift of my genius and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and pilfered wherever opportunity offered. The captain of the company to which I belonged had ſome handſome ſhirts to which I took a longing, and borrowed a few of them for my own uſe. In this I was detected, tried by a court martial, ſentenced to receive five hundred laſhes well laid on, and to be deprived of the rank of corporal. The ſentence was inflicted with the utmoſt rigor, and ſo ſevere was the operation that I fainted away at the halberts after receiving about half of the puniſhment. The remainder of the ſentence was delayed for a few days, and then was doubly ſevere as my back had not recovered from the preceding operation. This will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the large ſears which I now have on my back. This treatment for ſo trifling an offence as that of borrowing a few ſhirts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me to take my leave of the regiment as ſoon as we returned to Old England. We landed at Portsmouth on the third of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032353_0008_0FF1EEEDE71C63E0"/>and on the nineteenth of the next month I <hi>deſerted,</hi> after having ſerved not quite eight years.</p>
            <p>London was my object and to that I haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and here I gave a full ſcope to my propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. The ſecond day after my arrival I picked the pocket of a gentleman of five guineas. A few nights after I aſſociated myſelf with a ſet of <hi>burglars,</hi> and we broke open a ſhop in Cheapſide and robbed it of fifty guineas worth of goods and about ten guineas in caſh. My next attempt was on the houſe of a banker, in company with a notorious villain named <hi>Jack Tryall.</hi> We ſucceeded and robbed the banker of five hundred guineas. This laſt robbery occaſioned conſiderable alarm, and as a large reward was offered for our apprehenſion, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to take my leave of old England for a time and went to France in March 1792. Paris opened a new field to me, there I intended to exert all my ingenuity; but in this proſpect I was ſuddenly diſappointed; for on my arrival at Calais, not having money enough for the journey, I ſallied out one evening, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily picked the pocket of one of the officers of the police. Unfortunately I was detected in the fact, apprehended, taken before one of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032353_0009_0FF1EEEFD3EB3E40"/>the tribunals, and ſentenced to be whipped a la mode militaire. The old wounds in my back were made to bleed afreſh by theſe cut-throats, and revolutioniſts. Had not the government been changed and purged of its former ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites I ſhould have eſcaped ſo ſevere a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; but to be arreſted in the firſt ſtep was what I could not, nor ever will forgive. This reception made me change my determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inſtead of going to Paris, I went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the country. I boarded at a farm houſe, and ſupported myſelf by <hi>dilapidations</hi> from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. In the neighbourhood were I lived, there lived an Abbe, who had formerly reſided in England, where he acquired ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Engliſh language. With him I ſoon became acquainted, and it was from him that I acquired my knowledge of the French language. I ſoon diſcovered in him a kindred ſpirit, and we early commenced a partnerſhip, and ſupported ourſelves genteely at the expence of the neighbourhood. After our friendſhip was confirmed he informed me, that he was obliged to fly from England for being concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in counterfeiting guineas and forging bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes. My friend the Abbe and myſelf paſſed our days very happily together in this innocent neighbourhood for near ſix months, till at
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032353_0010_0FF1EE99DD8A7830"/>length it began to be ſuſpected and whiſpered that we were the authors of the robberies of which moſt of them complained. Having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſmarted under the laſh of thoſe curſed ſans culottes, and cut-throats, and fearing a detection that might expoſe me to a ſimilar and perhaps a worſe fate, I ſuddenly took my leave and went to <hi>Havre de Grace.</hi> Here I employed myſelf in my uſual occupation till I ſcraped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether money enough to defray my expences to America, for which I determined to embark. I took a paſſage to New York and landed there in the month of October 1792.</p>
            <p>I have now brought myſelf to the United States. Alas! it would have been well for me if I had never ſet foot in any country of liberty and equality! Being without money I determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to obtain a ſupport in my cuſtomary way, and broke open a ſtore in William ſtreet, out of which I got ſome caſh and ſome fine goods. I had, in the ſhort time I remained in that city, acquired ſufficient information to know that this mode of employment would not ſerve me long; that I would ſoon be detected, and my race would ſoon be at an end. The money I acquired by the robbery in William ſtreet ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled me to take ſtage for Philadelphia. Here
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032353_0011_0FF1EF07EE3911A0"/>I remained for a ſhort time and then went to Wilmington. At this laſt place I determined to avail myſelf of my knowledge of the French language for a ſupport, and became a teacher. The little encouragement I met with, affording but a ſcanty ſubſiſtance, I left Wilmington and returned to this city. Here I began to teach the French language, to tranſlate French into Engliſh, and now and then to ſcribble a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph for <hi>the Gazette of the United States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the month of July, 1794, Dr. PRIESTLY landed at New-York. Knowing that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Britiſh government drove him to this country, and knowing at the ſame time that this would furniſh me with an opportunity to panegyrize that government and traduce him, and thereby attract the attention of his Britannic majeſty's agents here, and aware that PITT paid well for ſervices rendered him, I wrote a pamphlet entitled <q>Obſervations on the Emigration of Dr. JOSEPH PRIESTLY.</q> No circumſtance of my life afflicts me more than this. In this pamphlet I indulged the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of a heart too much devoted to vice, and libelled a philoſopher and a friend to human nature, the recollection of which embitters my laſt moments. I abominated his principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032353_0012_0FF1EF09B9A61268"/>they were favourable to liberty, and every thing like liberty or republicaniſm, I held in deteſtation from the moment I had a judgment of my own. An affection for my king was drawn in with my mother's milk, and I have ever cheriſhed a love for monarchy with as much zeal as I did a hatred for liberty. Pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and inclination thus ſtimulating me I hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bloody flag againſt Dr. PRIESTLY. The Obſervations, as I expected, excited the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one of his majeſty's agents. He ſoon found me out, and we ſoon underſtood each other. He told me that the Britiſh cauſe was languiſhing in this country, and that ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts muſt be ſpeedily made or it would be loſt forever. He obſerved further, that the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration was well diſpoſed towards Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and had a ſecret deteſtation of France ſince the revolution commenced—that a dread of the people only, who were intoxicated with the French Revolution and the Rights of Man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained them from ſhowing their affection for the one and abhorrence of the other—that the adminiſtration had an averſion from republican doctrines and principles, and were endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecretly though ſurely to aſſimilate the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to that of Great Britain.—To effect objects ſo deſirable and ſo important to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032353_0013_0FF1EF114DA247B8"/>and his cauſe, it was neceſſary to alienate the people from France and ſubdue their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the mother country.—He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that I had talents which might be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully employed to this end—that I had given an evidence of my capacity in the Obſervations, and that he would furniſh materials if I would put them into form. He further remarked with a ſmile, that I had a talent at <hi>miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation</hi> and <hi>fabrication,</hi> which appeared to him original, and would, if well managed, produce great effects upon the minds of the people. Flattered by theſe civilities and ſtrongly impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a deſire to ſerve my king in whatever country I might be ſituated, and willing to abandon a mode of life which was attended with ſo much riſque, I enliſted again in the ſervice of my ſovereign. Five hundred guineas a year was to be my ſalary, and if ſucceſs attended my purſuits, the ſum was to be increaſed. We parted, and he told me at parting, that he would conſult ſome of his friends in the government, obtain their aſſiſtance, and in a few days I ſhould hear from him again. In a few days I received a packet from him by a confidential friend of his, containing materials, out of which I form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my "Bone to gnaw for Democrats," and bank notes to the amount of five hundred dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032353_0014_0FF1EF16F679C918"/>The bone to gnaw was ſoon ready for the preſs. It is not neceſſary here to tell the reader how faithfully I improved the hints which were given me at the interview with his majeſty's agent. The five hundred dollars ſeemed to have had an influence in brightening my genius of which I thought it unſuſceptible. Falſhood of the moſt flagrant nature, aſſerted with the utmoſt confidence, and gloſſed over as ſpeciouſly as poſſible conſtituted the eſſence of my firſt eſſay. In a few days after the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication the agent again called upon me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf well ſatisfied, and ſaid he would ſupply me with further materials—that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Secretary had promiſed him an ample ſtock. He was faithful to his promiſe, for in a few days I received a large packet, out of which I formed <hi>the ſecond part of the Bone to Gnaw, Plain Engliſh, New Year's Gift, Proſpect from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs Gallery,</hi> and a number of paragraphs for the <hi>Gazette of the United States</hi>—As I mean not to implicate a brother of the type, I will not mention the converſation with the agent rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the laſt mentioned Gazette.</p>
            <p>My productions began to excite attention. The agent paid me a third viſit, and ſuggeſted the propriety of coming forth from my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032353_0015_0FF1EF1ACC25B208"/>My fears were great, I trembled at the idea of being known, leſt the falſhoods and calumnies I had written ſhould excite the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the populace, and I ſhould become a victim to their rage. He laughed at my fears, told me there was no danger, that the people were a cowardly ſet and that I ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſome of the firſt characters in the government. He ſaid that he would advance me any ſum to procure me a good houſe, in a central place, that I might have an appearance of doing buſineſs; for, he remarked, if I ſhould be diſcovered in the place I was, and being engaged in no oſtenſible buſineſs, it might create a ſuſpicion, that I was a Britiſh emiſſary, and all our plans would be fruſtrated. He propoſed a book-ſtore as a proper employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which would afford a good cover to our objects. At his ſolicitation I conſented, took a houſe in a central part of the city at twelve hundred dollars a year, and opened a book ſtore. He advanced half a year's rent to my landlord, and wrote to a ſtaunch friend of his in New York to ſupply me with books, and that he would be accountable. The books were ſent and I opened my eyes to a new ſcene. Here I began my Political Cenſor; but as my ſtock of wit was but ſmall my works began to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032353_0016_0FF1EF1C9A3AC478"/>ſink in the public eſtimation, and it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſome expedient ſhould be hit upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alize the proſpects before me. Having often heard, that perſecution was one of the beſt means in the world to obtain celebrity, and excite the public attention and ſympathy, I fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricated a letter, which I conveyed to my land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, in which his houſe was threatened, and the ſevereſt denunciations were made againſt myſelf. My landlord ſwallowed the bait—he brought the letter to me, and I wrote a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet upon it called a <hi>"Scare Crow."</hi> At firſt this letter made conſiderable noiſe, and I had a rapid ſale for the pamphlet; but in a few days the people began to ſmoke me, and I again began to totter. Some aſſertions were made againſt me in the public prints which it became neceſſary to contradict, and therefore, I reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give a Hiſtory of my life and Adventures in which I blended ſome truth with much falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. A number of publications iſſued from the preſs immediately after the hiſtory of my life appeared, and among the number BRADFORD did me infinite injury. He alone was in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome facts much to my diſhonour, and he exhibited them to the world with all the malice of a French cut-throat. So much did I
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032353_0017_0FF1EF1E5E59CA68"/>ſmart under the facts which appeared againſt me that I began to deſpair. My friend the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, however, encouraged me by telling me of the number of friends I had, and by making me liberal allowances. He told me that the moment was critical, that the adminiſtration was alarmed, that the friends to Great Britain were in conſternation, and that we muſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in our efforts againſt France and againſt republicaniſm or we ſhould be undone. That the Britiſh treaty had been carried to be ſure, but that the majority was ſo ſmall as to excite conſiderable apprehenſions in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That there was great reaſon to fear that France would manifeſt ill temper at our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with great Britain and the diſſolution of our ties with her, and that plans muſt be laid to ſecure the ground which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and to effect a rupture in the end with the French Republic. He ſaid that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was ripe for the event; but the people had ſuch a bias in favour of France, that the experiment would be too hazardous, unleſs a greater change could be effected in the public mind. He ſuggeſted the propriety of commencing a daily paper, as a preferable mode to a monthly work, for accompliſhing the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032353_0018_0FF1EF2434AA96F8"/>object. In ſupport of the eſtabliſhment of a daily paper he urged the advantages which would ariſe to me from it; that the officers of the government would aid it with all their influence, and that he would furniſh a fund to give it a gratuitous circulation. I promiſed to take the propoſal into conſideration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him to allow me ſome time to think of it.</p>
            <p>The expected exploſion from the French Republic at length took place through her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ADET. He ſuſpended his functions by order of the Executive Directory, and ſtated the grounds of reſentment to the world. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the people were much alarmed at this event, the Adminiſtration were undiſmayed— things were working according to their plans and wiſhes. To make their purpoſes more ſecure, PINCKNEY had been ſent to ſuperſede MONROE. They were well appriſed that the new miniſter could not be received agreeably to national etiquette, and the exiſting ſtate of things, and the refuſal would prove a ſtrong argument to break entirely with the French Republic. The train was well laid and nothing was wanting but the match of time to give the exploſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:032353_0019_0FF1EF27A14F7740"/>
I continued my Cenſor and occaſionally gave a political blunderbuſs, till the meeting of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. After Congreſs were in ſeſſion a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was made to them on French af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. A long letter <hi>ſigned</hi> by the Secretary of State, and addreſſed to the miniſter PINCKNEY accompanied the communication. This letter was exactly in the ſtile which my friend the agent ſuggeſted, and was well calculated to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the contemplated rupture. The adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration was determined, my friend told me, (for he was in their confidence) at all events to break with France, and to form an alliance with great Britain. To this end the letter was written and publiſhed, and to this end all their meaſures tended. Encouraged by ſuch flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appearances, I reſolved to publiſh a daily paper, that I might contribute my means to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the deſign, and accordingly publiſhed my propoſals. My ſubſcription was rapid and great. Officers of government, clergymen and tories ſeemed to vie with each other in my ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The reverend <hi>Mr. Abercrombie</hi> aſſiſted me in obtaining ſubſcriptions, and was always ready with his aid and counſel. He profeſſed great affection for me and for the cauſe I was embarked in, and ſeemed to reliſh the obſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032353_0020_0FF1EF295E17FAC0"/>I now and then indulged in, as much as any of my patrons. No one can accuſe him of being ſtarched.</p>
            <p>It is unneceſſary to ſtate in this place, the temper of my paper—the libels, the falſhoods and the indecencies it contained. At one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I libelled the Governor, at another Mr. MONROE, and ſo I went on through the whole catatlogue of American patriots. Every falſhood which my inveteracy to the United States for their former rebellion, to the French Republic, and to republicaniſm could ſupply, was dealt out with a laviſh hand. Finding that ſome little irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had taken place in the public mind againſt the depredations upon our commerce by French cruiſers, I determined to try the temper of it, and if poſſible by one bold ſtroke, give a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete aſcendancy to the Britiſh intereſt. To effect this I wrote a letter containing an account of an aſſociation of <hi>Democrats</hi> to join the French in caſe of an attempt upon this country, and to give this letter the appearance of reality I ſigned it GEORGE WILSON, ſen'r. I employed a confidential friend to copy this letter and to convey it to my letter-box. Leſt it might be ſuppoſed a forgery, I took care to have evidence
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032353_0021_0FF1EF2B2035F4D8"/>at hand when I received the letter, to vouch for my having received it. The letter was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with all imaginable ſolemnity; but the effect diſappointed me. Inſtead of ſeeing a violent tumult, and an immediate arreſtation of the leading Democrats, I was ſummoned to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Mayor of the city to anſwer for the publication. My conſternation at this unexpected turn was indeſcribable. My cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard heart was ready to die within me. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore I never left my own houſe but under cover of the night or of a fog, or before I had previouſly reconoitered the ſtreet, and ſaw that all was ſafe; and to be obliged now to appear in propria perſonae, and that too before a legal tribunal, almoſt petrified me, I felt my heart in my breeches. My clerical friend and the agent called upon me and bade me be of good cheer. At the office of the mayor I was obliged to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer a number of interogatories; but contrary to my expectation, I was treated with great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention by ſome of the perſons preſent, which explained the words of my friend the agent when he bade me be of good cheer. Inſtead of the puniſhment which I expected for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, I was diſmiſſed with politeneſs, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home with a heart as light as a feather.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032353_0022_0FF1EF31368513B8"/>Finding myſelf thus patronized, and finding that the intereſt of the king my maſter was ſubſtantially ſupported by men in authority, I determined to publiſh another Cenſor, to which I annexed my laſt will and teſtament, or my laſt libel upon the patriotic Americans. Little did I then imagine that what was ſuggeſted by a ſportive imagination, was a preſentiment of my end. This laſt effort was too audacious— it excited general indignation and cauſed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to be lodged againſt me of a conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt the government. I was arreſted, my papers were ſeized and <hi>the plan diſcovered, to ſubjugate this Country to the power of great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> I was tried for high treaſon, convicted and ſentenced to be hanged and my body to be delivered to the profeſſor of anatomy for diſſection. Thus have I arrived at life's gole, and thus am I rewarded for an uninterrupted courſe of infamy and wretchedneſs. I hope my unhappy fate will prove a warning to others and that an ignominious end will make ſome atonement for the crimes of my life. My object was, and I now ſolemnly confeſs it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an offended Deity, to re-eſtabliſh the Britiſh dominion in this country, and to reſtore the United States again to their dependance
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032353_0023_0FF1EF350AD20118"/>upon great Britain, and to accompliſh this I traduced the character of FRANKLIN and of PAINE, and of every patriot who aided in the revolution, and have remained faithful to his firſt purpoſe. To effect an object ſo deſirable I ſneered at the late revolution and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to throw diſgrace upon it and the actors in it, as my writings will teſtify. The <hi>Democrats</hi> were my abhorrence for they were in the way of my plans. They were conſtantly on the watch, and often ſounding alarm. Had it not been for their machinations, my life would not at this moment be ſo near its cloſe, neither would the plans of my employers have proved abortive. My laſt breath ſhall be ſpent in curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for foiling me, in curſing the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can and French Revolutions and every thing that looks like republicaniſm, or liberty and equality.</p>

            <head>EXECUTION AND DISSECTION OF <hi>PETER PORCUPINE.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">WITH A GLOSSARY, BY THE AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>ON Saturday laſt made his exit, owing to a hempen neck-cloth being drawn too tight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about his neck, on the public ſquare near the Centre-houſe, one of PITT'S hirelings, known by the name of PETER PORCUPINE. He appeared to have had a preſentiment of his fate, whether from an accuſing conſcience, or from ſome intimation given him by his friend <hi>Belze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bub,</hi> cannot now be known; but ſuch was his impreſſion of the approaching and awful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he made his <hi>laſt</hi> will and teſtament, in which he intended ſome atonement for his life, by bequeathing his body for diſſection. As the cauſes of diſeaſes are very often diſcovered by diſſection, and remedies are found out by the aſcertainment of the cauſes, it ſeemed to be his opinion, that there either might exiſt a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical derangement, by which moral infirmity was excited, and which might be remedied by a knowledge of the cauſe; or he deemed a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his carcaſe to the knife, as all the atonement he could make for the tranſgreſſions
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032353_0025_0FF1EF389130B9F0"/>of his life, and therefore doomed himſelf to the expoſure and fate of a <hi>felon.</hi> He was attended on his viſit to the public ſquare by a would be divine, his particular friend and counſellor, and who was converted into an apoſtolic miſſionary as ſuddenly after the failure in a caſhierſhip, as St. Paul was on his way to Damaſcus, though not by the ſame inviſible agent. This <hi>pious</hi> prieſt and <hi>news-boy</hi> endeavoured to comfort him, by talking to him of a paradiſe, of which he knew little, and about grace, of which he knew leſs; but Peter was like Rachel, who wept over her loſt children, and would not be comforted. Deſpair, the conſequence of an over-load of guilt, had ſeized him, and the apparent agony of his mind excited the ſympathy of an injured people. Like CLIVE, his eyes longed for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; but like him, deſpair only was to be found. His fate was the moſt eloquent and pathetic lecture on morality and religion, perhaps, that ever was delivered. BOSSUET, in his famous funeral oration on Mary of Auſtria, the queen of France, was not ſo eloquent, nor ſo impreſſive.</p>
            <p>Agreeably to his own will and teſtament, and in conformity to a certain other decree, his body was delivered to the anatomical profeſſor for diſſection, which exhibited the folloing phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena:—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:032353_0026_0FF1EF3DF0C997F0"/>
On the back was a cluſter of <hi>long ſcars;</hi> they appeared like the cicatrices from deep ſcarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the profeſſor ſuppoſed them to have been occaſioned by <hi>a cat o' nine tails,</hi> as he once diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſame appearance on the back of a Britiſh ſoldier, who had been ſeverely whipped ſome time before his death. On opening the <hi>thorax</hi> a foetor iſſued ſo offenſive as to be nearly intolerable. It reſembled the ſmell from a dog in a ſtate of putrefaction. On removing the <hi>ſternum</hi> the thoracic viſcera exhibited a moſt extraordinary and unnatural appearance. The <hi>lungs</hi> were of a crimſon colour, compoſed of three lobes, the third lobe occupying the place of the <hi>mediaſtinum.</hi> They were of enormous ſize. On making an inciſion into them a vapour aroſe which benumbed the faculties of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders. On applying a candle near the orifice, it was extinguiſhed. A mouſe was held over the lungs and he inſtantly expired. Theſe phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena led to an opinion, that the air, which had been contained in the lungs, was of the ſame kind with that in the <hi>grotto del cani</hi> near Naples, rendered famous by the deſtruction of <hi>dogs,</hi> called formerly <hi>gas ſilveſtre,</hi> but known at preſent by the name of the <hi>aerial or cretaceous acid.</hi> A ſtrong ſulphureous ſtench aroſe from the lungs; they were ſoon removed with a pair of tongs, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032353_0027_0FF1EF44333223E0"/>thrown into the vault. The thorax ſeemed to be excluſively allotted to the lungs, for no other viſcus was to be found. Nothing remarkable appeared about the pleura.</p>
            <p>On opening the <hi>abdomen</hi> the firſt thing which diſcovered itſelf was the <hi>ſpleen,</hi> of an enormous ſize; it ſupplied the place of the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended itſelf acroſs the abdomen, and occupied a conſiderable portion of the hypogaſtric region. It adhered to the <hi>diaphragm.</hi> On making an inciſion into it, a yellow miſt aroſe, which ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſtorted every object; the effluvia had a remarkable effect on the bye-ſtanders; they no longer ſaw in each other ſame perſons; they became fretful and peeviſh, and would have quarrelled with each other, had not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor interpoſed, and by ordering the windows and doors to be thrown open, diſſipated the miſt and reſtored the perſons to their original appearance. The <hi>oeſophagus</hi> entered at the left orifice, which in the ſtomach is known by the name of <hi>cardia</hi> and the <hi>rectum</hi> began at the right orifice know by the name of <hi>pylorus.</hi> There was but one <hi>inteſtine,</hi> which might be called the <hi>rectum,</hi> as it formed the <hi>anus.</hi> It was a ſtraight gut, and had no <hi>valves,</hi> by which it appeared that its contents could be diſcharged either upwards or downwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:032353_0028_0FF1EF460C3DD9A0"/>
The <hi>liver</hi> was of unuſual ſize, and of a ſooty colour. On its concave ſide, beginning at its upper part and extending itſelf as low down as the fiſſure, was the <hi>gall bladder,</hi> of the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of an ordinary urinary bladder. It was in a ſtate of extreme diſtenſion. On making an inciſion into it, a mud coloured fluid iſſued from it extremely fetid. Two <hi>ducts</hi> communicated with the <hi>gall bladder;</hi> one from the <hi>oeſophagus,</hi> and the other from the <hi>rectum.</hi> On opening the convex ſurface of the liver, a large <hi>ſac</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered itſelf, in which was contained a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſmall living animals reſembling <hi>toads.</hi> There was a communication between this ſac and the gall bladder, by means of a duct. On being expoſed to the light, theſe toad-like ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals expired, apparently in convulſive agonies.</p>
            <p>Between <hi>the bladder</hi> and <hi>the anus,</hi> a ſmall black ſubſtance attracted attention, which was ſomewhat larger than a grape-ſhot. On exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it was found to be <hi>a heart,</hi> enveloped in a <hi>pericardium,</hi> which at firſt reſiſted the knife. After ſome difficulty the pericardium was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and a fluid reſembling coffee grounds was diſcharged, which on examination appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a ſubſtance ſimilar to the excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious matter from <hi>a hog.</hi> The heart, which was little larger than that of <hi>a chicken,</hi> had a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032353_0029_0FF1EF4A2E6D5870"/>livid appearance, and in many places gangre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſpots. Both <hi>auricles</hi> and <hi>ventricles,</hi> as well as the <hi>pulmonary artery,</hi> the <hi>aorta,</hi> and the <hi>venoe cavoe,</hi> were charged with a dark coloured fluid reſembling putrid bile. From the ſituation of the heart it might be ſaid literally to have been <hi>in his breeches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>pancreas,</hi> or <hi>ſweet bread,</hi> appeared either not to have exiſted or to have been totally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated.</p>
            <p>The <hi>cranium,</hi> or <hi>ſcull,</hi> almoſt baffled the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the ſurgeons, it was of ſuch immenſe <hi>thickneſs</hi> and ſolidity. Several ſaws were ruined by it.—On removing it, the <hi>dura</hi> and <hi>pia mater</hi> made equal reſiſtance to the ſcalpel; they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be formed of <hi>corneous</hi> matter. The <hi>brain</hi> was about the ſize of a gooſe's egg. There was no <hi>cerebellum;</hi> the little which appeared was <hi>cerebrum</hi> only. On cutting into the <hi>cerebrum</hi> it was hollow, and in the cavity were myriads of ſmall animals, which on examination with a glaſs reſembled <hi>tad-poles.</hi> The fluid which che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed them was of a mud colour.</p>
            <p>The <hi>tongue</hi> was bifurcated and perforated. At the root of it were two ſmall bags, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a fluid like that in the gall bladder; the other like that contained in the ſpleen. Each of theſe bags had a duct which entered them from the oeſophagus.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:032353_0030_0FF1EF4DCBDAA718"/>
The <hi>ears</hi> had no <hi>lobes</hi>—They appeared to have been pared away by a ſharp inſtrument.</p>
            <p>The foregoing is a ſhort but accurate account of the diſſection of PETER PORCUPINE, and the phoenomena which his carcaſe diſcovered. To the ingenious and the learned will be left the ſolution of the extraordinary appearances.</p>
