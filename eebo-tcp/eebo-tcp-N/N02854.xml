            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

This is the light &amp; view I purpoſe to conſider theſe <hi>Luſts</hi> in, and no doubt is the true meaning of them in the <hi>Text.</hi> I know they are frequently elſewhere taken in a different &amp; more reſtrained ſenſe.

And as all theſe in particular, ſo all other kinds in general of theſe fleſhly Luſts are to be avoided, and abſtained from, and not to be indulged. And this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty advice, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> backs and enforces with
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003408_0005_10034DE8E7568E80"/>
               <hi>two</hi> of the moſt important <hi>Reaſons</hi> in the World, with two of the moſt moving Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the <hi>one</hi> is drawn from our unſetled State and Condition in the preſent World. As <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and Strangers.</hi> We all know with what careleſneſs and indifference <hi>Travellers</hi> abroad in the World are wont to treat the Objects they meet with: Theſe they are not wont to be much affected with, looking upon themſelves as abſent from and quickly to return home. And ſuch ſhould our carriage be towards the enjoyments of the preſent World, we ſhould carry it with the like coldneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference towards them. The <hi>other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is taken from the great danger of indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe fleſhly Luſts, and the <hi>great wrong and injury they will moſt certainly do the Soul:</hi> they <hi>war againſt it,</hi> and if indulged, will be likely to gain the victory and conqueſt over it, and finally will ruin &amp; deſtroy it. And altho' both theſe Arguments are very weighty and forceable to perſwade Men to abſtain from fleſhly Luſts; it is the <hi>laſt</hi> of them only, even as they will be exceeding hurtful and <hi>injurious to the Soul,</hi> that I purpoſe in the <hi>preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> to confine my ſelf to; tho' the other may have ſome place in the Diſcourſe. And the general <hi>Obſervation</hi> I ſhall make as the ground and foundation of the Diſcourſe ſhall be this <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>OBSER.</hi> That we ſhould abſtain from the inordinate indulgence of fleſhly Luſts, as they are very hurtful and injurious to the Soul.</p>
            <p>I ſay ſinful or inordinate Indulgence of <hi>fleſhly Luſts,</hi> becauſe taking of fleſhly Luſts in <hi>one ſenſe,</hi> the indulgence of them is lawful, and ſo cannot be hurtful or injurious to the Soul. Man in his two Conſtituent parts is <hi>Body</hi> &amp; <hi>Soul.</hi> And there are the Luſts or deſires of the Body after theſe and thoſe <hi>ſenſible Objects,</hi> after thoſe things that are neceſſary to the ſupport and comfort of it. And theſe deſires are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted on purpoſe to move Mankind to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thoſe things that are in ſuch reſpects neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the Body, to render it eaſy and happy. And it would moſt certainly carry in it a groſs reflection upon the great <hi>Creator</hi> and wiſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our Being, to ſuppoſe that He had made us with theſe deſires, and all in vain; yea, and when it muſt needs be a Crime in us to ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the gratification, or the ſatisfaction of them. But it is ſo far from this, that GOD Himſelf is pleaſed to propound theſe ſenſible things to us as ſo many motives or arguments, to perſwade us to the practice of Religion. How often is He pleaſed to make the promiſes of <hi>Temporal Rewards</hi> to Mankind, to encourage them to Obedience. The arguments like that, in <hi>Job</hi> 36.11.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003408_0007_10034DEADCAD79F8"/>
are frequent, <hi>if they obey and ſerve him, They ſhall ſpend their Days in proſperity, and their Years in pleaſures.</hi> Now, can it be tho't rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that GOD ſhould thus propound theſe things to us, as arguments to Obedience; when at the ſame time it would be unlawful for us to love &amp; eſteem them in ſome degree &amp; meaſure; and in the ſame proportion to look upon our ſelves favoured, and ſo far happy, when we are arrived at the enjoyment of them. There are then theſe <hi>Deſires</hi> that may be termed <hi>Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> ſuch as are to theſe &amp; thoſe ſenſible Objects, that are adapted to the ſupport &amp; comfort of the Body, and without which Mankind could not poſſibly Subſiſt, much leſs be happy, that are lawful; and when theſe deſires are confined within their <hi>proper bounds</hi> &amp; limits, extend no further than the Nature and the Neceſſity of them do in reaſon allow, tho' they are ſtill <hi>Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> they are not injurious to the Soul; not hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful but ſubſervient to the vigour of it, and the exerciſe of its Powers in this imbodied State, wherein the Soul &amp; the Body bear ſo intimate a relation to one another. It is then the <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate indulgence</hi> of theſe <hi>Deſires,</hi> that now falls under Conſideration, and is ſo injurious to the Soul: And how hurtful and injurious they are in <hi>all reſpects</hi> to the Soul, is exceeding hard to declare. There is no one reſpect that can be tho't on, wherein theſe fleſhly Luſts inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indulged, are not <hi>warring againſt the Soul.</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003408_0008_10034DEF529FA788"/>
I would mention a <hi>few</hi> of the moſt obvious, important and comprehenſive Inſtances wherein they are <hi>injurious to the Soul;</hi> which is all that can be allowed me, in the limits of a ſhort Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: which will abundantly diſcover to us of how great weight the Argument is, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to <hi>abſtain from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The inordinate indulgence of theſe Luſts, is <hi>Degrading and Debaſing to the Soul;</hi> and in this reſpect injurious to it. As the two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituant parts of Man are <hi>Body and Soul,</hi> and make the humane Compound, ſo the Soul is by far our moſt <hi>ſuperiour Part,</hi> and from this we are principally &amp; chiefly to draw our Character. This Soul is truly and ſtrictly Heaven-born: is the immediate <hi>Offspring of GOD;</hi> without ſo much as the Agency and Inſtrumentality of any ſecond Cauſes at all; and on this account claims kindred with the <hi>Supreme</hi> of the works of GOD, with the <hi>Angels,</hi> thoſe <hi>Morning Stars,</hi> thoſe bright Intelligences. By this we ſtand nearly related to the World above. While the other part of us, the Body was <hi>formed out of the Duſt,</hi> made of the ſame vile Materials, that the inferiour Creation was made of; and on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this, we very much reſemble and ſtand nearly related to the World below: and while this Body is thus groſs and earthy, the Soul is Spiritual and Immortal, endowed with the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Powers of <hi>Underſtanding, Willing,</hi> Chuſing, Refuſing, and the like: is capable of more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,

manly and ſuperiour Pleaſures, than what can poſſibly flow from the gratification of the ſenſes, from any bodily ſatisfactions. And muſt it not then be a great diſhonour to the Soul, an Eclipſing of the Glory and Dignity of it, to make it a Servant, a Slave to the <hi>Body?</hi> That while it is ſo excellent and ſuperiour in it ſelf, capable of a far greater happineſs than can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly flow from the indulgence of fleſhly Luſts, the Soul ſhould be made to lie groveling <hi>in the Duſt,</hi> and converſe with nothing but Fleſh and Senſe. It is moſt certainly a horrid Degradation to the Soul, and it brings Mankind upon a level with <hi>the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> Upon the account of this Soul it is that we (eſpecially) excel the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

A <hi>ſenſual</hi> happineſs, is the higheſt they both aim at, and that both are purſuing after. Where then is the difference? To make the Soul thus to truckle to the Body, and to bring it down to ſerve only the mean purpoſes of it, and to converſe with nothing but Fleſh &amp; Senſe, while it is capable of, and ſhould be employed in the <hi>ſervice of GOD,</hi> and be <hi>converſing with things Heavenly &amp; Divine,</hi> moſt certainly is a ſhame to us; a horrid ſtain to our Nature; the greateſt diſhonour to us: and ſo far the deſtoying of our Character, is injurious to us.</p>

The indulgence of theſe fleſhly Luſts, tend <hi>greatly to darken &amp; obſcure the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Soul,</hi> and in this regard is very hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and injurious. There is nothing that tends more directly to render the Soul cloudy &amp; dark, than the ſteams of ſenſual Luſts: as theſe tend directly to quench the Motions of the <hi>Holy SPIRIT,</hi> ſo they do to put out the Light of Underſtanding in the Soul. The ſubduing and mortifying theſe ſenſual Luſts, has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to improve and brighten the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and upon this account the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us, Pſal. 19.7, 8. <hi>The Teſtimony of the Lord is ſure, making wiſe the ſimple, the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the Eyes. And a good Underſtanding have all they what keep his Commandments.</hi> And on this account he was wiſer &amp; excelled his <hi>Teachers;</hi> while the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging theſe &amp; thoſe ſenſual Luſts tends directly to render the Soul, unactive, dull &amp; ſottiſh. How does <hi>Intemperance, Unchaſtity</hi> and the like fleſhly Luſts, not only exhauſt &amp; drink up the very Spirits of the Man that indulges himſelf in the Practice of them, but alſo caſt a Miſt and a Cloud over his Underſtanding, and render him inſenſible, and keep him in a conſtant Doze, as tho'tleſs and inadvertent as the very <hi>Beaſts that periſh.</hi> We ſee this in many a Senſualiſt; not only that his Body becomes a walking Hoſpital, full of all kinds of loathſome Diſeaſes, but his Soul full of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Confuſion;</hi> and the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003408_0011_10034DF5440B00F0"/>
Light of Underſtanding by GOD light up in the Soul, almoſt totally obſcured and put out. And is not this a great Injury to the Soul, to have any Miſts and Clouds hang upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, upon which we abſolutely depend to direct our way for us, and in all caſes to make it plain before us? We are unſpeakably Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py (yea it is one of our greateſt Miſeries) on the account of that Darkneſs that has wrapped up the Underſtanding by our firſt parents Fall; and yet every ſinful Luſt indulged tends to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Darkneſs thicker and more total ſtill; ſo injurious is it to the Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The indulgence of theſe fleſhly Luſts is <hi>Deſtructive of the Peace &amp; Quietneſs of the Soul.</hi> The happineſs of Man on Earth conſiſts in the quietneſs and eaſineſs of his Mind; and the only way to attain and enjoy this happineſs is to mortify our Luſts and Corruptions, and to be ſteady in the Practice of <hi>Religion;</hi> and the indulging ſinful Luſts tends directly to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Soul <hi>reſtleſs and uneaſy</hi> both while Men live, and very commonly when they come to die.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Peace of the Soul is deſtroyed</hi> by the indulgence of ſinful Luſts <hi>for the preſent, even while the Man Lives.</hi> It is impoſſible but Vice ſhould make the Soul uneaſy; for Sin is the Sickneſs and Diſtemper of it; and the Soul can no more be eaſy &amp; calm, while it is infeſted with it, than the Body can be eaſy, with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003408_0012_10034DF8A6ACE100"/>
Bone or a raging Fever. If the Senſualiſt has not ſtupified &amp; ſinned away his Conſcience, it is impoſſible but that he ſhould be always uneaſy and diſcontented, and his Soul like the <hi>troubled Sea.</hi> What can the lively apprehenſions of the Wrath of GOD produce in the Soul, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar and confuſion! And this is every where repreſented to be the true State of a Sinner, that he enjoys no true Peace. He may ſeem out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Eaſy and Merry; but alas! it is only from the Teeth outward: Could we but retire into the Breaſt of ſuch a Man, we ſhould find a great deal of uneaſineſs and ſorrow. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the wiſe Man concerning them is, <hi>That in the midſt of laughter their Heart is ſorrowful, and the end of their Mirth is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs.</hi> And the Prophet in the moſt lively manner repreſents their reſtleſneſs, by the Sea when ruffled by a Storm or Tempeſt, whoſe Waters <hi>cannot reſt,</hi> but are continually <hi>caſting up Mire &amp; Dirt.</hi> There is <hi>no Peace ſaith my God to the Wicked,</hi> Iſa. 57.21. The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of preſent Peace muſt be laid in Holineſs. <hi>Great Peace have they</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>that love thy Law, and nothing ſhall offend them.</hi> The <hi>work of Righteouſneſs ſhall be Peace, and the effect of Righteouſneſs Quietneſs and Aſſurance forever.</hi> Religion tends to allay thoſe guilty Fears that commonly ariſe in the Sinner's Soul, and to create that Peace &amp; Joy, that the Sinner never intermeddles with, and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003408_0013_10034E01D8078510"/>
muſt forever be a ſtranger to, let him be in what Place, in what Employment, in what Company ſoever. This is generally the Sinner's Caſe; except by the repeated Acts of Vice, and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent indulgence of fleſhly Luſts, his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is grown callous &amp; ſtupid; which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition next to deſperate; for while he that is awake and in danger, is like to uſe Means for his ſafety, he that is aſleep periſhes without Tho't or Care. And as the indulgence of theſe tends to deſtroy the Peace of the Soul, while the Man Lives; ſo,</p>
            <p n="2">2. They <hi>have the ſame tendency</hi> when <hi>Men come to Die.</hi> And truly, however Men for the preſent may amuſe and ſtifle their guilty Fears, <hi>then</hi> they will be boiſterous and break forth; and if they are not prevented by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and ſtupefaction of the bodily Diſeaſe, they will then fill the Soul with uproar and confuſion. And indeed what can be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a ſenſual Life, but this uneaſineſs and diſcontent? If the Man that has led ſuch a Life when he comes to Die be awake there is nothing moſt certainly in that gloomy Hour, that can poſſibly be a ſolid Foundation of Peace and Comfort to him, let him caſt his Tho'ts which way he will. Suppoſe he then runs back in his Tho'ts upon the paſt Paſſages of his Life, he finds them all fill'd up in the gratification of his Luſts; finds his whole Life to have been ſpent in pampering the Body, and in ſerving
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003408_0014_10034E0F16732970"/>
the Intereſts and the Deſires of it. And all the while his Soul has been never once tho't on to any purpoſe, but left ſtarving and dying; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done for the Safety and Happineſs of it. Can there be any ground of Peace in this, thus to run back in his Tho'ts for Years paſt, be it <hi>Twenty, Thirty,</hi> or <hi>Forty</hi> Years together, and find not one Action that he can reſt ſatisfied in? none but muſt needs adminiſter uneaſineſs &amp; terror to him. And if he looks <hi>inward,</hi> turns in upon the Tho'ts of his Soul, will the proſpect be more comfortable than to reflect upon the Actions of his Life paſt? Verily No! There he finds the <hi>imaginations of the tho'ts</hi> of his Soul to have been <hi>evil only evil and that continually.</hi> There he finds all the Powers of his Soul diſordered and defiled by thoſe ſenſual Luſts, that his whole Life has been ſpent in the gratification of. He finds his Underſtanding deſtitude of the Knowledge of things Spiritual &amp; Divine; ſuch groſs Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that the things of the Spirit of GOD are counted fooliſhneſs; the <hi>Will</hi> fixed on ſenſual Objects, chuſing them, and full of enmity againſt GOD, and refuſing any ſubjection to Him and His Law. And from a lively ſenſe of theſe things, there we ſhall find <hi>Conſcience</hi> rouzing like an angry Lion, and arraigning &amp; condemning the Sinner for all his ſinful Indulgences and worldly Luſts, that his Memory in a freſh and very lively manner brings now before him, and ſets in the light of His Countenance, as they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003408_0015_10034E181114AE40"/>
have always been in the light of GOD's. And can there be any Eaſe of Comfort in this proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? No verily, nothing but diſtreſs and anguiſh! And ſuppoſe he caſts his Eyes around him, there he beholds no ground of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or Relief neither. He beholds, it may be, his old <hi>Companions</hi> in Sin and Wickedneſs, thoſe that have tempted <hi>him,</hi> and thoſe that <hi>he</hi> has tempted into theſe and thoſe Vices! But all theſe are only ſo many Remembrancers of his Sin and Guilt unto him, and ſo many additions to his preſent Miſery and Torment. And he may behold others alſo, that may drop a Tear to behold his Diſtreſs and Anguiſh, and in ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Pity and Compaſſion will pour out a Prayer for his poor diſtreſſed Soul: and that is all they can do; for when they would gradly ſpeak Peace to him, they dare not in faithfulneſs to GOD and his Soul; they ſee no ſolid Foundation for it. And then, O how dreadful the Proſpect to look upwards! there to behold the Heavens gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blackneſs &amp; thundering; GOD armed with revenging Juſtice, haſtening to puniſh him for all his horrid Crimes; reſolvedly fixed (as he has the greateſt reaſon to fear) never to ſhew one article of Mercy to him more. And therefore tho' he would now gladly be looking up to GOD, who before has been in none of his tho'ts, he dare not: he is now afraid to look unto Him, whom he has ſo often and ſo greatly affront'd; and yet he dare not caſt an eye any other way,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003408_0016_10034E21CA504DF8"/>
every proſpect is ſo full of horror. He ſees no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before him but Legions of Devils, waiting for, ſtanding ready to catch, and greedily to ſeize on his guilty Soul, and to drag it away with them, to their uncomfortable abodes; to be its unhappy convoy to the Place of Torments, even to Hell, which he beholds gaping to receive it. And in this confuſion, the unhappy Creature would be glad to Repent &amp; cannot; he knows not where to begin this important buſineſs, nor where to end: and in this confuſion, the bodily diſeaſe draws on apace, and ſhuts up the Scene of his unhappy Life; and in this dreadful hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror he dies. Are not then, theſe fleſhly Luſts inexpreſſibly <hi>injurious to the Soul,</hi> when they lay ſuch a foundation for its miſery, while the Senſualiſt Liv'd, and when he came to Die?</p>
            <p>And then,</p>
            <p n="4">4. If we follow the <hi>Soul into the ſeparate State,</hi> there we ſhall find how infinitely more injurious theſe Luſts are unto it. Where the Soul is immediately lodged upon its ſeparation from the Body, in what Place, may not be ſo eaſy perhaps to determine; tho' in a different Place, it may be, from what it will be after the Reſurrection of the Body, and the final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherever the Place be, whether in ſome diſmal Cavern, ſome gloomy Vault underground, it is certainly where the Soul is miſerable; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy beyond all tho't and expreſſion. It is immediately gathered with Sinners like it ſelf,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003408_0017_10034E3032655E00"/>
into the ſame Place of miſery, horror &amp; deſpair; placed at an infinite diſtance from the Fountain of all Good, and the Center of our Happineſs; ſhut out from His favour, and under His frowns, and the bitter effects of His Anger, that, <hi>O who knows the power of!</hi> but theſe unhappy Creatures, that feel the dreadful weight of it: Condemned to the moſt wretched Society; to the Company of Devils and damned Ghoſts, like it, tormented in every Power of it: having Miſery adapted to the Nature of every Faculty, and particularly tormented with the ſtrongeſt deſires after thoſe ſenſual Satisfactions, that it ſinfully indulged while on Earth: and at the ſame time deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, utterly of the gratification of them; and all the while, full of direful expectations of more wrath and miſery to fall upon them, at the final Judgment, (ſo the <hi>Devils believe &amp; tremble</hi>) and of raging deſpair, ariſing from a full aſſurance of their being by the immediate Decree of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, chained down to endure this Miſery to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> This in brief is ſome ſmall part of the injury, theſe fleſhly Luſts, when inordinately indulged, do to the Soul in the <hi>future State;</hi> as GOD has plainly <hi>threatned,</hi> and as is the natural <hi>tendency</hi> of them. And who now can queſtion (even from theſe general hints) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe Luſts are injurious to the Soul or not? when they are ſo hurtful to it for the preſent and for the future, in this World and in the next. And what more powerful Argument can be
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003408_0018_10034CFE9CFA26E0"/>
tho't on to perſwade all Mankind to <hi>abſtain from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the only IMPROVEMENT I would make of what has been ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That as <hi>we love &amp; regard our Souls,</hi> we would be perſwaded <hi>to abſtain from fleſhly Luſts that thus war againſt them.</hi> Arguments drawn, only from the preſent Welfare of the Body, are won't to come with great Force upon us. When we ſee this is for the Health, that for the Eaſe, and the other for the Pleaſure of the Body, we are eaſily perſwaded to attend to them, and purſue after them: And ſhall we be more eaſily moved to take care of the Body than of the Soul? And be ſooner awakened to guard againſt any Injury that may happen to that, than of wronging the Soul, and that in the moſt ſubſtantial manner that can be? There are many and the moſt weighty Conſiderations that can be, to diſſwade us from expoſing our Souls to ſo great a Miſery, as we ſhall do by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging of ſinful Luſts; but what more weighty than theſe? We muſt be regardleſs of the <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of them, deſtroy the <hi>Peace</hi> of them for the <hi>preſent,</hi> and lay a ſure Foundation for their <hi>unſpeakable Miſery</hi> in the coming World: And yet we cannot be perſwaded to abſtain from them. Theſe Conſiderations, in point of our own Intereſt, make it the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable thing in the World, that we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003408_0019_10034D73D6C0D440"/>
be upon our Watch and Guard, that the Soul be not enſlav'd to the Body, and be made to ſerve the mean Deſires and the ſordid Luſts of it. All Mankind are in great danger of being inordinate in the indulgence of theſe Luſts. The <hi>natural Man</hi>'s Life is ſpent in little elſe; and therefore the Warning is very neceſſary and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for us all. But among Mankind, none are in greater danger, and more prone to give themſelves a greater Liberty herein, than the <hi>Youth.</hi> To you then, O <hi>Young Men,</hi> is this Exhortation, with the greateſt tenderneſs, and yet with the greateſt importunity, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dearly Beloved, I beſeech you abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, that war againſt the Soul:</hi> That war againſt the Honour, the preſent Peace &amp; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happineſs of it. Be perſwaded now to wage open War with theſe Luſts, and never ſuffer them to gain the victory over you. You ſee how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably injurious they will be to you, (if indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged) while you Live, when you come to Die, and what a Miſery they lay you open to in the other World. And theſe Conſiderations are of vaſt weight, to move you now to engage in this <hi>Warfare:</hi> And to encourage you into this War, I would add a <hi>few Conſiderations</hi> (tho' general) yet the moſt moving; and then leave with you an important <hi>Direction or two</hi> for the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and conclude the Diſcourſe. And to perſwade and encourage you then to wage War
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003408_0020_10034E4DB555C730"/>
with theſe Luſts, that War againſt the Soul, conſider theſe <hi>three</hi> things only, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>no other Advantage</hi> you can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly propound to your ſelves, <hi>will recompenſe the Damage of Soul, you will ſuſtain by indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging theſe fleſhly Luſts.</hi> You may propound the Advantage of Pleaſure or of Profit, and the like. And particularly the advantage of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> is one of the ſtrongeſt Temptations to Men in <hi>Youth</hi> to indulge their Luſts: But alas! What are theſe, compared with the vaſt wrong and injury that is done the Soul? Our <hi>Saviour</hi> has already determined this for us: He has ſummed up the Account, and declares this to be the foot of it, that if for the ſake of all the Pleaſures, Riches and Honours of this whole World, a Man ſhould expoſe and loſe his Soul, he would be an infinite loſer; would make the like fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Bargain with him, who exchanges Pearls for Pebbles, Gold for common Duſt; and infinitely more fooliſh, Mat. 16.26. <hi>What is a Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, if he gain the whole World and loſe his own Soul, or what ſhall a Man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his Soul?</hi> This Miſery, this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury we bring upon the Soul, cannot be weighed down, by all that the moſt extravagant Senſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt could poſſibly wiſh for, ſhould he arrive to the Enjoyment of it all. And you will but infinitely cheat and deceive your ſelves, if you hope to obtain any thing that will equal this Miſery, and be a Ballance to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:003408_0021_10034E5820AF2448"/>And then Conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a</hi> poſſibility, <hi>and if you engage in the Warfare</hi> while in Youth, <hi>a</hi> probability <hi>of obtaining the Victory and the Conqueſt.</hi> Now you have a greater and more hopeful Proſpect of it, than you will have hereafter. Indeed it is a Warfare that muſt be maintained, and will continue as long as we remain in the Body. We muſt wage a conſtant War with theſe Luſts: we muſt be always mortifying and ſubduing of them; but the greateſt ſtruggle &amp; conflict is <hi>at firſt:</hi> Then is the oppoſition greater, and the conqueſt the more difficult to obtain. The after conflicts will be more eaſy. And multitudes by the help of the <hi>SPIRIT of CHRIST,</hi> have conquered them; and by the help of the ſame SPIRIT are going on <hi>conquering &amp; to conquer.</hi> And the ſame SPIRIT and Grace are ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to aſſiſt your ſincere Endeavours: Yea, if you now early engage in this Warfare, you of all others, have the moſt hopeful proſpect of the Victory. For nothing is more pleaſing to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, than to behold one in <hi>Youth,</hi> that is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with the moſt powerful Temptations to indulge them, waging open War with theſe ſenſual Luſts; and whoever hopes to obtain Divine Aid and Aſſiſtance, ſuch a one has no reaſon to Deſpair of it. The longer theſe Luſts are indulged, the more difficult &amp; hard does it grow to mortify &amp; ſubdue them; for <hi>repeated Acts</hi> of Vice do moſt certainly ſtrengthen the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003408_0022_10034E5B31E06AD8"/>
               <hi>Habit,</hi> and render a Man's Repentance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation the more difficult &amp; unlikely. Hence is that of the Prophet, <hi>Can the Ethiopian change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots? Then may ye that are accuſtomed to do Evil, learn to do well.</hi> And will you now expoſe your Souls to this Miſery, by indulging ſinful Luſts, when you may thus conquer them all! And when if you engage againſt them, depending on the <hi>SPIRIT</hi> and the <hi>Strength</hi> of CHRIST JESUS, you may be ſure of Succeſs. How inexcuſable will you be, when there is a poſſibility, and the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt probability of ſecuring your Souls from it, if after all you thus wrong and inſnare them?</p>
            <p>And then conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Finally, <hi>An incorruptible Crown of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be the Iſſue of the Conqueſt.</hi> If you get the Maſtery over theſe Luſts, you not only deliver the Soul from that Miſery, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is in every reſpect expoſed to; but you will lay a ſure Foundation for a Crown of Life and Glory that will never fade away. That moſt certainly will be the happy Concluſion of the Conqueſt. And will you not ſtrive for the Maſtery, when in the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of GOD, ſo great a Prize is in view? Moſt certainly, very unworthy are his Tho'ts of the <hi>Joys &amp; Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the heavenly World,</hi> that prefers the Pleaſures of Sin before them; and at the ſame Time, does it at the loſs and expence of his Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:003408_0023_10034D0C53E08BF8"/>Theſe, among the many Conſiderations I might have left with you, are weighty enough to perſwade you to engage with Courage and Reſolution againſt theſe Luſts that War againſt the Soul.</p>
            <p>I have now a few general &amp; plain <hi>Directions</hi> to leave with you; and I have done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Beg of GOD to give you a juſt notion of the World, a right view of it's Enjoyments.</hi> The wrong apprehenſions and the falſe notions that Mankind entertain of the preſent World and it's Enjoyments, is one of their greateſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries here on Earth: for from miſtaken appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of theſe things; from looking upon theſe things as moſt excellent, eaſily and very naturally follows the miſtake of exerciſing our greateſt Care about them. And none are more prone than Perſons in <hi>Youth</hi> to entertain an <hi>unjuſt Thought</hi> of theſe things. They look gay and tempting to them, and commonly make a fair ſhow of <hi>Happineſs;</hi> and they above all others, are in the utmoſt danger of purſuing them under that notion. They cannot ſee that the <hi>Riches</hi> of this World are <hi>uncertain,</hi> that the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> are all <hi>ſhort-liv'd, flaſhy &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfactory;</hi> and that worldly <hi>Honours</hi> are more <hi>empty</hi> than either of them: They cannot be perſwaded, but that Happineſs conſiſts in the Enjoyment of theſe. They ſee not theſe things in their true <hi>Colours;</hi> they view them in a falſe Light, and no wonder they make a falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003408_0024_10034E78390CE390"/>
of them. And as thro' the darkneſs and blindneſs of their Minds, they do not ſee thro' the deceit of theſe things; ſo they may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed more eaſily upon, having not met with ſo many <hi>Diſappointments</hi> in their Expectations from them, and in their purſuits after them. And therefore, one of the firſt things you ſhould beg for and labour after, is, that you may have a <hi>true ſight of the Vanity of the World,</hi> and of the inſufficiency of all it's Enjoyments to make you ſubſtantially Happy, that you may not be impoſed upon and cheated by the ſeeming and tranſitory Glory of theſe things. In this lies your greateſt hazard as you firſt appear in the World and on the Stage of Action. And here then ſhould be your greateſt Guard. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til your Tho'ts are corrected, and your Views ſet right about the preſent World, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any Conſiderations ſhould prevail upon you, to diſſwade you from indulging ſenſual Luſts; from purſuing the Riches, Honours and Pleaſures of this World to make you Happy. As the Foundation of all then, Cry to GOD, as you are ſetting forth into the World, That He would open your Eyes, and effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, that Happineſs lies not below the Skies, and that He would <hi>turn away your Eyes from beholding Vanity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Seek earneſtly for the Divine SPIRIT to help and aſſiſt you in the conquering &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing your fleſhly Luſts.</hi> Tho' it be upon all
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003408_0025_10034E7FC2BBC888"/>
accounts reaſonable in you now to wage open War with theſe Luſts, yet engage not in it truſting and depending on your ſelves. You are not ſtrong enough, nor ſufficient to conquer and overcome the leaſt Corruption, that your ſenſual part calls upon you to gratify &amp; indulge, entirely of your ſelves; but will fall down an eaſy Conqueſt before the leaſt Aſſault. You abſolutely need the SPIRIT &amp; Grace of CHRIST to aid &amp; aſſiſt you; and theſe you have the ſtrongeſt ground to ſeek for, from that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement or Promiſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> gives to move you to plead for them, Mat. 7.7. <hi>Ask, and ye ſhall receive; ſeek, and ye ſhall find, knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi> And in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> words, He there tells you, that He is more willing to <hi>give His HOLY SPIRIT</hi> to you, than ever you can find the moſt indulgent of your <hi>earthly Parents</hi> to beſtow <hi>theſe things</hi> upon you. And will you not then, under a deep ſenſe of the <hi>need you have of the SPIRIT,</hi> to aſſiſt you to mortify your Luſts &amp; Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and under a ſenſe of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to afford Him to you, be perſwaded to go earneſtly to our <hi>Saviour</hi> by Prayer, that you may obtain thoſe Aſſiſtances from His SPIRIT that may be ſufficient for you? Tho' you cannot of your ſelves conquer your Luſts, you can do it by the SPIRIT of GOD: And GOD never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied His SPIRIT to thoſe that ſincerely &amp; ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly cry'd to Him that they might obtain Him.

Go then to GOD, and plead His readineſs to beſtow, and your need to obtain the SPIRIT; and you will be ſucceſsful, and ſo gain the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and conqueſt over all your Luſts and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
