            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For, besides the useful Labours and Contemplations of many of the Lords Worthies in other places, and in former times, contributing to our Help, and shewing our Principles to be neither novell nor singular, the advantage of Experience and Practise, and the occasion thereby given for daily searching into the Rule, is considerable. And He that hath made</hi> the path of the just as the shining light, <hi>is wont still to give unto them further light, as the progress of their path requires f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

stating and reducing unto practise. For though the Principles thereof were included in what is already published, yet that there hath been a defect in practise (especially since of late years there, was more occasion for it) is too too apparent: For the rectifying whereof, a more particular Explication of the Doctrine also about these things, is now necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In order hereunto, by the Care and Wisdome of our Honoured</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Court, <hi>calling upon all the</hi> Churches <hi>of this Colony, to send their</hi> Elders <hi>and</hi> Messengers, <hi>this</hi> Synod <hi>was assembled, who after earnest Supplications for Divine Assistance, having consulted the holy Scriptures touching the Questions proposed to them, have proceeded to the following Issue; hoping that if it might seem meet to the Father of Lights to guide the Churches unto a right Understanding and Practise of his Will in these things also, the beauty of Christ's wayes and Spiritual Kingdome among us would be seen in some more compleatness then formerly. For that which was the prayer of</hi> Epaphras <hi>for the</hi> Colossians, <hi>ought to be both the prayer and labour of us all;</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> that we might stand perfect and compleat in all the will of God: <hi>And we trust it is our sincere desire, that his Will, all his Will, and nothing else but his Will, might be done among us.</hi> To the Law and to the Testimony <hi>we do wholly referre our selves, and if any thing in the following Conclusions be indeed found not to speak according thereunto, let it be rejected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are not ignorant that this our Labour will by divers be diversly censured; some will account us too strict in the Point of</hi> Baptism, <hi>and others too laxe and large: But let the Scriptures be Judge between us all. There are two things, the Honour whereof is in a special manner dear to God, and which He cannot endure to be wronged in;</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>His</hi> Holiness, <hi>and His</hi> Grace. <hi>The Scripture is often putting us in minde how much the Lord loveth Holiness, and that in his House, and in the holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of, and how he abhorreth the contrary,</hi> Mal 2. 11. Psal. 93. 5. &amp; 2. 6. Lev. 11. 44, 45. Ezek 22. 26. &amp; 44. 7, 8. <hi>And hence neither dare we admit those unto the holy Table of the Lord, that are short of Scripture-qualifications for it;</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Ability to</hi> examine themselves, <hi>and</hi> discern the Lords body; <hi>Nor yet receive or retain those in Church-estate, and own them as a part of the Lords holy People, that are visibly and notoriously unholy, wicked and prophane: such we are bidden to</hi> Put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

among us. Neither may we administer Baptism to those whose parents are not under any Church-power or Government any where. To baptize such, would be to give the Title and Livery to those that will not bear the yoke of Christs Disciples, and to put the holy Name of God upon them, touching whom we can have no tolerable security that they will be edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the wayes of Holiness, or in the knowledge and practise of Gods holy Will.</hi> Baptism, <hi>which is the Seal of Membership in the Church</hi> the Body of Christ, <hi>and an</hi> engaging Sign, <hi>importing us to be the devoted</hi> Subjects <hi>of Christ, and of all his holy Government, is not to be made a common thing, nor to be given to those, between whom and the God-less licentious world there is no visible difference: This would be a provocation and dishonour to</hi> the Holy One of Israel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On the other hand, we finde in Scripture, that the Lord is very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his</hi> Grace; <hi>that he delighteth to manifest and magnifie the Riches of it, and that he cannot endure any straitning or eclipsing thereof, which is both dishonourable unto God, and injurious unto men,</hi> Gal.2 21. Eph.2.7. &amp; 3. 2,6,8. Rom 11. 1,5. Acts 15. 10,11. &amp; 10. 15 &amp; 20. 24,26,27. <hi>And in special he is large in the</hi> Grace of his Covenant <hi>which he maketh with his</hi> visible Church <hi>and People, and tender of having the same straitned. Hence when he takes any into Covenant with himself, he will not only be</hi> their God, <hi>but</hi> the God of their seed after them in their generations, <hi>Genes.</hi> 17. 7,9. <hi>And although the apostate wicked parent (that rejecteth God and his Wayes) do cut off both himself and his Children after him,</hi> Exod. 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5. &amp; 34. 7. <hi>Yet the Mercy and Grace of the Covenant is extended to the faithful and their seed unto</hi> a thousand generations, <hi>if the successive parents do but in the least degree shew themselves to be</hi> lovers of God, and keepers of his <hi>Covenant and</hi> Commandments, <hi>so as that the Lord will never reject them till they reject him,</hi> Exod 20. 6. Deut. 7. 9. Psal 105. 8, 9.

Neither dare we exclude the same children from Membership (or put them out of the Church) when they</hi> are grown up, <hi>while they so walk and act, as to keep their standing in the Covenant, and doe not reject the same.

irreligious inconsistency with the love of true Religion: But to bear one with another in lesser differences, about matters of a more difficult and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversal nature, and more remote from the Foundation, and wherein the godly-wise are not like-minded, is a Duty necessary to the peace and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Religion, while we are in the state of infirmity.

What is here offered is farre from being any declining from former Principles, it is rather a pursuance thereof; for it is all included in, or deducible from what we unanimously professed and owned in the fore-mentioned</hi> Platform of Discipline, <hi>many years since.

               <hi>It may be an Objection lying in the mindes of some, and which many may desire a fuller Answer unto; That these things, or some of them, are</hi> Innovations <hi>in our Church-wayes, and things which the Lord's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies in</hi> New-England, <hi>who are now with God, did never teach nor hold, and therefore why should we now, after so many years, fall upon new Opinions and Practises? Is not this</hi> a declining <hi>from our first Purity, and a blameable Alteration? To this: Although it were a sufficient Answer to say, That in matters of Religion, not so much what</hi> hath been <hi>held or practised, as what</hi> should be, <hi>and what the Word of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes, ought to be our Enquiry and our Rule.

If therefore the things here poopounded concerning the children of Church-members, and the Consociation of Churches, be a part of the Will of God contained in the Scriptures, (as we hope the Discourse ensuing will shew them to be) that doth suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently bespeak their entertainment, although, they had not formerly been held or heard of amongst us.

That this Membership of children hath no tendency in it to pollute the Church, no more then in the Old Testament, but is a means rather of the contrary; And that there is as much danger (if not more) of the degenerating and apostatizing of Churches gathered of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing Believers, as of those that rise out of the seed of such.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Prudden <hi>in a Letter to a friend written in the year</hi> 1651. <hi>doth plainly express it to be his judgement,</hi> That the children of Church-members, are Members, and so have right to have their children baptized though themselves be not yet admitted to the Lords Supper. <hi>His words are these:</hi> Touching the desire of such Members children as desire to have their children baptized, it is a thing that I do not yet hear practised in any of our Churches. But for my own part, I am inclined to think, that it cannot justly be denied, because their next Parents (however not admitted to the Lords Supper) stand as compleat Members of the Church, within the Church-Covenant, and so acknowledged that they might have right to Baptism. Now they being in Covenant, and standing Members, their Children also are Members by virtue of their Parents Covenant and Membership, as well as they themselves were by virtue of their Parents Covenant and Membership; And they have not renounced that Covenant, nor are justly censured for breach of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but do own it and profess it, and by virtue of it claim the priviledge of it to their Children. <hi>Then he puts this his Argument into form thus:</hi> Those Children who are within the Covenant of the Curch, and so Members of it, Baptism cannot be denied unto. But the Children in question are within the Covenant of the Church, and so Members of it. Therefore Baptism cannot be denied unto them. The Assumption is proved thus: The
<pb facs="unknown:000068_0011_0F9F1B29D2366250"/>
Children of such Parents as are within the Covenant of the Church, and so Members of the Church, are themselves within the Covenant of the Church, and so Members of it. But the Children in question are Children of such Parents as are in Covenant, and so Members of the Church. Therefore they are so themselves. The Proposition is clear, because the Parents Covenant for themselves, and for their Children, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10,—16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 8,13. And God accepts both, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12,13. the whole Nation is foederally holy, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9. 2. they are expresly said to be in Covenant with their fathers, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. not partly or partially in Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3,4. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 39. and God styles himself their God as well as their fathers, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7,8,9. and to have God to be our God, is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Church-Covenant with him. The Assumption is evident, because else such their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had not had right to Baptism the Seal of the Covenant, but that they had right unto, and so received it; and the same right that they had, their Children have, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in their Covenant, as they were in their fathers, and are not less <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>So that it was the judgement of these Worthies in their time, that the children of Church-members are members of the Church as well as their parents, and do not cease to be members by becoming adult, but do still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the Church, untill in some way of God they be cast out; and that they are subject to Church-discipline, even as other members; and may have their children baptized before themselves be received to the Lords Supper: and yet that in this way there is no tendency to the corrupting of the Church by unworthy members, or of the Ordinances by unworthy partakers.

               <hi>Brethren, bear with us: Were it for our own Sakes, or Names, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, we should not be sollicitous to beg Charity of you. With us</hi> it is a small thing to be judged of man's day. <hi>But it is for your sakes, for your children's sake, and for the Lord's sake, that we increat for a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, candid, and considerate Acceptation of our labour herein. It is that the</hi> Congregations <hi>of the Lord might be</hi> established <hi>before Him in</hi> Truth and Peace, <hi>and that they might have</hi> one heart and one way <hi>in the fear of God,</hi> for the good of them and of their children after them. <hi>Do we herein seek our selves? our own advantage, ease or glory? Surely we feel the contrary! What is it we desire, but that we might do our utmost to carry your poor Children to Heaven; and that we might see these Churches bound up together in the Bonds of Truth and Peace?</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us this wrong. <hi>But should the Church-education of your children be by the want of your hearty concurrence, rendred either unseizible or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual; should they live as</hi> Lambs in a large place, <hi>for want of your agreement to own them</hi> of the Flock, <hi>we beseech you to consider how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable the account hereof would be another day. We pray with the Apostle,</hi> that you do no evil, not that we should appear approved,
<pb facs="unknown:000068_0014_0F9F1B301DECA118"/>
but that you should do that which is <hi>good and right,</hi> though we be rejected. For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth: and this also we wish, even your perfection, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7,8,9. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we hope after-ages will bear witness, that we have been in some measure faithful to the Truth in these things, and to this part of Christs Kingdome also in our generation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But we may not let pass this opportunity, without a word of Caution and Exhortation to the</hi> Youth <hi>of the Country, the</hi> children <hi>of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whose Interest we have here asserted. Be not you puffed up with Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, but humbled rather, in the awful sense of the Engagement, Duty and Danger that doth attend them: It is an high favour to have a place in</hi> Bethel, in the house of God, and in the gate of Heaven; <hi>but it is a</hi> Dreadful place: <hi>God will be</hi> sanctified <hi>in all that</hi> come nigh him. <hi>A place nigh unto God</hi> (<hi>or among his people who are</hi> near to him, Ps. 148. 14) <hi>is a place of great fear,</hi> Psa. 89. 7. Take heed <hi>therefore unto your selves, when owned as</hi> the people of the Lord your God, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 9, 10.) left there should be among you any root that beareth gall and worm-wood. <hi>Take heed that you do not with a spirit of pride and haughtiness, or of vanity and flightness, either challenge or use any of your Priviledges. Think not to bear the Name of Christians, without bearing the Yoke of Christ. Remember, that all Relations to God and to his people, do come loaden with</hi> Duty; <hi>and all Gospel-duty must be done in</hi> humility. <hi>The wayes of the Lord are right, and the humble and serious shall walk in them, but proud Transgressors shall fall therein. Be not</hi> sons of Belial, <hi>that can bear no yoke: Learn subjection to Christs holy Government in all the parts and wayes thereof. Be subject to your godly Parents: Be subject to your spiritual Fathers and Pastors, and to all their instructions, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and Exhortations: Be subject unto faithful Brethren, and to words of counsel and help from them:</hi> Ye younger, submit your selves unto the elder; <hi>and to that end,</hi> be clothed with humility. <hi>Lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Word and Will of Christ, as dispensed and conveyed to you by all his appointed Instruments in their respective places. Break not in upon the Lord's Table (or upon the Priviledges of full Communion) without due qualification, and orderly admission thereunto, lest you</hi> eat and drink your own damnation. <hi>Be ordered, and take not upon you to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the affairs of Gods Family; that is not the place of those who are yet but in the state of Initiation and Education in the Church of God. Carry it in all things with a spirit of humility, modesty, sobriety and
<pb facs="unknown:000068_0015_0F9F1B343136C528"/>
fear, that our soules may not weep in secret for your</hi> pride, <hi>and that God may not</hi> resist &amp; reject <hi>you as a generation of his wrath. Oh that the Lord would pour out a spirit of Humiliation &amp; Repentance upon all the younger sort in the Country, (yea &amp; upon elder too, for our neglects) from</hi> Dan <hi>to</hi> Beersheba! <hi>Oh that we might meet at</hi> Bochim, <hi>because so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Canaanites of unsubdued, yea growing corruptions are found among us! Let it not be said, that when the first &amp; best generation in New-England were</hi> gathered to their fathers, there arose another generation after them that knew not the Lord. <hi>Behold, the</hi> Lord had a delight in your fathers to love them, <hi>and he hath chosen you</hi> their seed after them, <hi>to enjoy these Laberties &amp; Opportunities, as it is this day:</hi> Circumcise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fore-skin of your hearts, and be no more stiff-necked, <hi>but</hi> yield your selves to the Lord, <hi>and to the Order of</hi> His Sanctuary <hi>to seek him, and wait on him in all his wayes with holy fear and trembling, for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return unto him; if you seek him he will be found of you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever.</hi>

The Answer to the</hi> second Question <hi>is here given with great brevity, partly because so much is already said there-about in the foresaid</hi> Platform of Discipline, <hi>and partly by reason of great straits of time: But what is here presented was the</hi> joynt conclusion <hi>of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.

            <head>THE ANSWER OF THE ELDERS AND OTHER MESSENGERS of the Churches, Assembled at Boston in the Year 1662, TO The Questions Propounded to them by ORDER of the Honoured GENERAL COURT.</head>

            <p>
               <hi>Answ: The Answer</hi> may be given in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing propositions, briefly confirmed from the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They that according to Scripture, are Members of the Visible Church, are the subjects of Baptisme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Members of the Visible Church according to scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are Confederate visible Believers, in particular Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and their infant-seed,</hi> i. e. <hi>children in minority, whose next parents, one or both, are in Covenant.</hi>

            <p n="6">6 <hi>Such Church-members, who either by death, or some other extraordinary Providence, have been inevitably hindred from publick acting as aforesaid, yet have given the Church cause in judgment of charity, to look at them as so qualified, and such as had they been called thereunto, would have to acted, their children are to be Baptised.</hi>

5. <hi>The Circumcision is often put for the whole Jewish Church or for the members of the visible Church under the Old Testament.</hi> Those within are expressed by [<hi>the circumcised</hi>] and those without by [<hi>the uncircumcised.</hi>] <hi>Rom:</hi> 15. 8. &amp; 3. 30. <hi>Eph:</hi> 2,11. <hi>Judg:</hi> 14. 3. &amp; 15.18.1 <hi>Sam</hi> 14.6 &amp; 17.26,36. <hi>Jer</hi> 9,25,26. Hence by proportion Baptisme (which is our Gospel circumcision, Col:2. 11,12.) belongs to the whole visible Church under the new Testament. Actual and personal circumcision was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed proper to the males of old, females being but inclusively and virtually circumcised, and so counted of the circumcision: but the Lord hath taken away that difference now, and appointed Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme to be personally applied to both sexes: <hi>Act:</hi> 8. 12. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Gal:</hi> 3 28. So that every particular member of the visible Church is now a subject of Baptisme.

To say their standing is disorderly, would be to impute disorder to the order of Gods Covenant, or irregularity to the Rule.
