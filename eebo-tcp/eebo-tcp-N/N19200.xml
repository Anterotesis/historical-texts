            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SHOULD this Diſcourſe ever be read beyond the bounds of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> it perhaps would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inform the reader, that the MIDDLESEX <hi>Medical Aſſociation</hi> is ſo called from it's being compoſed of practitioners living in the County of <hi>Middleſex</hi> only.</p>
            <p>This county deviates a little from a ſquare, but it's area is nearly equal to a ſquare of forty miles on a ſide. It is divided into <hi>forty one towns,</hi> and from a late enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is found to contain rather more than <hi>forty two thouſand inhabitants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The principal towns are <hi>Cambridge, Concord, Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, Medford</hi> and <hi>Watertown.</hi> CAMBRIDGE is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by the UNIVERSITY. A Society, that has for more than a century furniſhed ſupplies of Stateſmen, qualified to ſupport the rights of mankind, and men eminent in every branch of literature.</p>
            <p>CONCORD, a town pleaſant and flouriſhing, is ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated nearly in the center of the county. CHARLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TOWN is connected with BOSTON by a bridge <hi>fifteen hundred feet</hi> long. Cambridge, Concord, and Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town, were rendered famous by the military events of 1775 and 1776.</p>
            <p>Middleſex is watered by five rivers; the <hi>Merimac,</hi> the <hi>Charles,</hi> the <hi>Concord,</hi> the <hi>Naſhua,</hi> and the <hi>Miſtic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſouthern and northern ſides of the country are hilly; but cannot be conſidered as mountainous, few of the hills exceeding an hundred feet in height, being generally wooded or cultivated quite to the ſummit.</p>
            <p>The climate is very fine, the air generally ſerene, and the temperature mild. The extreme variation of Fahrenheit's thermometer may be conſidered as an <hi>hundred</hi> degrees in an year; but it is in very few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that in the courſe of the year it reaches either
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:024987_0004_100A864B35560D80"/>
extreme. <hi>Ninety two</hi> degrees may be conſidered as the extreme of ſummer heat; and <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> degrees below 0 as that of the winter cold. Inſtances are to be found of it's exceeding theſe limits, but they are ſo rare, as to be exceptions to the general rule.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>At <hi>Newton,</hi> which joins to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the bills of mortality have been kept for a ſeries of years with great exactneſs. By them it appears that the annual number of thoſe who have died within ten years, paſt, is one out of <hi>ſeventy,</hi> and for the nine years preceeding one out of <hi>eighty.</hi> In <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Paris</hi> it is computed that one out of <hi>twenty</hi> die annually. In <hi>Boſton</hi> one out of <hi>forty five,</hi>

                  <p>An opinion has prevailed that the Americans fall ſhort of the longevity of the inhabitants of Europe. After premiſing that we are leſs atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in collecting the inſtances of long life here than in Europe, we ſhall enumerate a few extracts from the news-papers during 1789 and 1790.</p>

            <head>An Abſtract from the Conſtitution of the MIDDLESEX MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.</head>
            <p>I. AS health is a bleſſing which ſweetens all enjoyments, and long life that which all men naturally deſire, ſo he who labours to teach his fellow creatures how to ſecure the one, and to attain the other, may juſtly be numbered among the benefactors of mankind.</p>
            <p>II. SEEING, the mind and body have ſuch a mutual influence on each other, that, examined apart, they can never be thoroughly underſtood, it is incumbent on every one who taketh upon himſelf the title of Phyſician, to examine and ſtudy the conſtitution and influence of both, in order that he may preſerve to his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that greateſt of bleſſing, <q>
                  <hi>a ſound mind in a ſound body.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>III. IT is the duty of the Phyſician, by a ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful direction of the powers of human nature, to preſerve as long as poſſible, the life, the health, and faculties committed to his care. The charge is important, the field extenſive, and the calling honourable.</p>
            <p>IV. To qualify himſelf for ſuch noble purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it is his duty to examine the animal economy, to attend to the outward operations of nature, and to the qualities and operations of medicines,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:024987_0006_100A864FE5A33548"/>
in order to inveſtigate the cauſes of diſeaſes, and to learn their cure.</p>
            <p>V. As of all natural bodies, none are found ſo variouſly compounded as the human; ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into its nature, is to be placed among the moſt ſubtle and difficult of ſtudies. The moſt improved and readieſt meaſures ought therefore to be purſued to facilitate an inquiry ſo difficult.</p>
            <p>VI. THE Medical Art is the offspring of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: yet life is too ſhort, occaſion too ſudden, experiment too dangerous, and judgment too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for any one perſon to acquire a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent knowledge of diſeaſes, and their remedies, by his own experience.</p>
            <p>VII. As Phyſick therefore muſt grow up from a ſucceſſion of diſcoveries and experiments hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down from generation to generation, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that any individual, however warmly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to promote the utility of his profeſſion, can do but little, unleſs he has the united obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others to aſſiſt him. Hence the expediency of Societies and Aſſociations.</p>
            <p>VIII. OF the various methods of attaining and diffuſing Medical knowledge, none is found ſo effectual or deſirable, as a friendly intercourſe and aſſociation of its profeſſors, eſpecially when their principal aim is mutual improvement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="unknown:024987_0007_100A8653DB48AE20"/>
IX. MOREOVER, by thus aſſociating, ſuch liberal and generous ſentiments will probably be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, as tend to eradicate prejudices and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy practices, which at times have not only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced the profeſſion, but injured mankind.</p>
            <p>X. CONVINCED of theſe things, and of the neceſſity of making obſervations ourſelves, inſtead of relying on thoſe made in a diſtant quarter of the globe, WE, whoſe names are hereunto ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, do form ourſelves into a Society, by the name of the MIDDLESEX MEDICAL ASSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIATION, and do agree to the regulations following:</p>

               <p>Whereas manifold inconveniences have ariſen, from the want of a regular and uniform method of educating pupils in phyſick, eſpecially in the country, whereby candidates for practice, when offered to the regularly appointed examiners, have been embarraſſed and obſtructed, though otherwiſe not ill informed: It is therefore the deſire of this Aſſociation to remedy as ſpeedily and prudently as poſſible, an inconvenience ſo loudly complained of.</p>

               <p>As this matter may not have been ſufficiently conſidered, it will not perhaps be uſeleſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that for want of regularity and method, the young mind often perplexes itſelf, and makes not an advantageous uſe of the real helps within its reach. Much the greateſt difficulty the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent has to encounter, is to know how to avoid thoſe who are only the compilers and tranſcribers of thoſe who went before them, and apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the few original authors. The ſyſtems of phyſick are moſtly compilations, and differ from one another, rather in neatneſs, order, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, than in any thing material. Hence the expediency of uſing a ſet of approved authors in the various branches of medicine. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly recommended to each and every

            <head>ON THE RISE, PROGRESS, AND PRESENT STATE OF MEDICINE, A DISCOURSE.</head>
            <p>IN complying with the requeſt of this aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I perceive nothing more difficult, than to beſtow on what is common the grace of novelty, and to render ſo dry a ſubject as phyſick in any degree entertaining to a mixed audience. Our theme leading to the frigid and formal ſtyle of a lecture, rather than the animated ſtrains of an oration.</p>
            <p>THE hiſtory of the medical art is ſo well known to the members of this ſociety, that my taſk will be rather to remind than inform them: Yet what ſubject can be more ſuitable for our firſt diſcourſe, than the hiſtory of <hi>the riſe and progreſs of the</hi> HFALING ART: That art whoſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diffuſion is the end and aim of our aſſociation?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:024987_0013_100A86607A11D458"/>
THE origin of moſt arts is involved in fable, and wrapt in great obſcurity; that of medicine ſeems covered with almoſt an impenetrable veil. Until the greater purpoſes of ſociety were anſwered, the neceſſities of mankind ſupplied, architecture and other neceſſary arts introduced, men of genius had neither leiſure nor inclination to record their theories of the origin of mankind, and the riſe of the arts. The remedies firſt ſought for, in the earlier ages, were probably ſome mild, tenacious, plaſtic ſubſtances, ſuitable to defend a wound from air, and ſecure it from external injuries. Accident and random experiment may have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the number of ſuch ſimple remedies, which may have been treaſured up by a particular family, or ſome individual of a tribe. But at theſe early periods of ſociety, when letters were unknown, what was once out of ſight was loſt forever.</p>
            <p>IF we ſearch the oldeſt book we have for infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation on this ſubject, we ſearch in vain. This will not appear ſo extraordinary to thoſe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect that the ſacred hiſtory is confined to but a part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and a ſmall portion of the north eaſt part of <hi>Africa;</hi> and that it is ſo conciſe in regard to time, that the hiſtory of twenty centuries is compriſed in eleven ſhort chapters.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Geneſis.</note>

               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:024987_0014_100A8663C7544C08"/>
WE find the author of theſe annals, the hebrew legiſlator and general, giving directions for the health of his people; but no mention is made of Phyſicians, as a diſtinct profeſſion, until the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming of <hi>Jacob.</hi> Prior to theſe writings, is the aera of abſolute darkneſs; and we have no account by which we can judge of ancient tradition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we admit that of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> whoſe great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, corroborated by aſtronomical obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, carries the hiſtory of the human race a vaſt way further back. Yet their ſlight acquaintance with anatomy, and their ignorance of chemiſtry, render their great knowledge in phyſic as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as their chronology.</p>
            <p>AS we receive ſo little light from theſe ancient proſe writers, let us turn towards thoſe earlier luminaries the Poets.</p>
            <p>POETRY has every where preceded proſe, and the powers of the imagination always have been indulged, before the operations of the judgment were exerciſed. Thoſe early effuſions of genius were epic poetry, or exaggerated hiſtory, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing battles, heroes and ghoſts; dwelling on the marvellous, and often the incredible. In theſe fabulous ages it was the cuſtom to dreſs inſtruction in the garb of allegory. Thus the <hi>Egyptian, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> poets attributed the origin of the Healing Art to the Sun, who was called <hi>Orus</hi> by
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024987_0015_100A86662C46A3F8"/>
the Egyptians, <hi>Phoebus</hi> and <hi>Apollo</hi> by the Greeks and Romans. Conceiving the ſun to be the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of life and cheerfulneſs, whoſe genial warmth and vivifying energy animated and ſuſtained all nature; they adored it as the reſplendent ſource of light, life, health and joy. They ſaw nothing on earth which bore ſo ſtriking a reſemblance to this heavenly luminary, as he, who relieved pain, diſſipated melancholy, diſpelled diſeaſes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed life. Thence they concluded that the firſt phyſician was an offspring or emanation of the <hi>"Prime cheerer light."</hi> Accordingly we find the claſſical poets repreſenting <hi>Apollo,</hi> as the primary GOD of phyſic; and his ſon Aeſculapius whom they alſo deified, as its firſt profeſſor. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the human body to a delicate muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eaſily diſordered, and therefore united muſic and medicine in Apollo. They conceived that the office of the phyſician, was to tune this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated organ the body, to make every part act in concert, and reduce the whole to harmony.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Bacon de augment. Scientiar.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE perſon of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> is ſo envelloped in fable, that we ſcarcely know when, or where he lived. He is confounded by ſome with <hi>Melam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> who lived about 100 years after <hi>Moſes,</hi> and who having travelled into Egypt, brought from thence into Greece, not only the art of phyſic, but much of their theology and ſuperſtition, together with their magic or divination.</p>

               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:024987_0016_100A8667B6140A38"/>
FROM every account we muſt conclude, that <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> was highly venerated for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and uſefulneſs. The antients not only pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him among their GODS, but erected more than ſixty temples to his honor in Greece, and in the Grecian colonies. Theſe Aeſculapian temples were the firſt ſchools of phyſic. People reſorted to them from all quarters, in order to be healed of their diſeaſes. Remarkable cures were engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hung round their walls in form of votive tablets;<note n="*" place="bottom">The learned <hi>Graterus</hi> has preſerved ſeveral of theſe inſcriptions. One is as follows: <hi>"Lucio affecto lateris dolore, et deſperato ab omnibus hominibus, oraculum reddidit Deus. Veniret; et ex tribomo tolleret cinerem, et uná cum vino comiſceret, &amp; poneret ſupra latus.

            <p>AMONG the ruder nations, the prieſt, the conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the phyſician were united in the ſame perſon.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Diodorus</hi> relates that it was the cuſtom antiently to apply to the profeſſors of vaticination to obtain health. L. v. p. 235. We find in ſcripture, that when <hi>Aſa</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the phyſicians, it was condemned as an impiety. Chron. xvi 12. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſent his wife to the prophet when his ſon <hi>Ahijah</hi> was ſick.</note> It was ſo among the <hi>Aegyptians, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians</hi> and <hi>Grecians;</hi> among the people of <hi>India,</hi>

where they are called <hi>Brachmans;</hi> among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Germans, French, and Britons, where they were called <hi>Druids.</hi> It was ſo among the <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans</hi> and <hi>Peruvians;</hi> and obtains at this day among our Aboriginals. The untutored mind is apt to aſcribe all diſmal diſeaſes and ſhocking accidents to the influence of inviſible beings: and the prieſts, not only cheriſhed this opinion, but ſtudiouſly inculcated, that their cure muſt be ſought from the Deities, through the interpoſition of their miniſters.</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of phyſic in Greece, at the period celebrated by <hi>Homer,</hi> was very ſimilar to what it now is among the aboriginals of this continent. Like their heroes, our Indians know how to treat wounds; and when baffled in the cure of any ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible diſorder, have recourſe like the Grecians, to incantations and inchantments.<note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>Homer'</hi>s account of the plague in the Grecian camp, B. I.</note> They likewiſe derived their ſkill from the ſame ſource, random trials, or empericiſm.</p>
            <p>THE Philoſophers of Greece were ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the vain and uſeleſs ſearch after the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary matter, that they neglected medicine, which was ſo far from being digeſted into a ſyſtem, that no one gave it ſufficient attention to make it a diſtinct profeſſion. This was the caſe till about 400 years before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when the famous HYPPOCRATES made collections from the public records of cure,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024987_0018_100A866D1AEF0118"/>
the inſcriptions or tablets in the Aeſculapian tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, where he was educated, reduced the whole into ſome order of ſcience, and laid ſo juſt and rational a foundation of phyſic for future ages, that he deſervedly obtained the name of the FATHER OF MEDICINE.<note n="*" place="bottom">Boerhaav. academ.

            <p>THEMISON was the founder of the <hi>methodic</hi> ſect.

                  <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſpeaking of him, ſays, "Quot <hi>Themiſon</hi> aegro autumno occiderit uno." Whether this be intended as a compliment or ſarcaſm, we leave critics to determine.</note> As this doctrine has lately been revived, we ſhall ſpeak of it, with its patron <hi>Themiſon</hi> and his follower <hi>Theſſalus,</hi> in another place.</p>
            <p>ABOUT 200 years before the chriſtian aera, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic and ſurgery, which in Greece had been prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by the ſame perſon, were ſeparated at Rome into three diſtinct provinces, the <hi>Dietetic, Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maceutic</hi> and <hi>Surgical.</hi> The above mentioned ſects were in exiſtence when the celebrated GALEN quitted his native country, Aſia minor, to practiſe at Rome. GALEN was a man of real genius, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by a careful education under the beſt teachers of the age He laid the foundation of his greatneſs in the ſchool of the Stoics, then ſtudied with the Academics, and finiſh'd with the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetics
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024987_0019_100A867071207638"/>
and Epicureans. After this he devoted himſelf to medicine, and collected the writings of the moſt celebrated phyſicians, eſpecially <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> whom he profeſſed to admire and follow. There is, however, ſays <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> this eſſential difference between the doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> the firſt is almoſt always ſupported by experience, and conſiſts of obſervations, while the other depends almoſt wholly on reaſoning; and it has accordingly happened, that the ſyſtem of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has afforded but little matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to thoſe who came after him, whereas, that of <hi>Galen</hi> has been a ſubject of juſt and well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded cenſure. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Galen'</hi>s doctrine, though in general falſe, and inapplicable, ſays <hi>Cullen,</hi> was received and implicitly followed by all the Phyſicians of <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> for more than 1400 years! He was ſuppoſed to have brought every part of medicine to perfection, and his ſyſtem thought infallible, and univerſally appealed to as an oracle.</p>
            <p>WE cannot ſet a very high value on the theories of the antient phyſicians, when we conſider the <hi>data</hi> upon which they reaſoned. Their notions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the animal oeconomy were abſurd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to the higheſt degree. They ſuppoſed that the veins had their origin in the liver; that they were the only veſſels that conveyed blood through
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024987_0020_100A8671F4FA7060"/>
the body; that in theſe it only moved backward and forward: that the arteries ariſing from the heart, contained the animal ſpirits which were ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated in that organ. They believed that the blood never entered the arteries, unleſs in a diſeaſed ſtate. As to the means of our nouriſhment, they had no juſt idea of it, and even ſuppoſed that the chyle was abſorbed in the liver, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted into blood.<note n="*" place="bottom">Aikins' Med.

            </p>
            <p>AFTER the ſixth century, a dark and diſmal chaſm intervened in medicine, literature, and the arts. All was ignorance, wonder, and credulity. The human mind, neglected, uncultivated, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſunk to the loweſt grade of debaſement.<note n="†" place="bottom">Millot Elements of Hiſt.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE moſt remarkable revolution recorded in the hiſtory of the human mind, is, the darkneſs and ignorance which enveloped <hi>Europe,</hi> while the <hi>Arabians</hi> were making progreſs in uſeful knowledge. The <hi>Caliph Haroun Al Raſchid</hi> eſtabliſhed an Univerſity at <hi>Bagdad,</hi> and qualified his countrymen to be inſtructors of all Europe. Wherever theſe Mahometans built a temple for worſhip, there they erected a medical ſchool and an hoſpital. They firſt introduced chemiſtry into medicine; and, though blended with many abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, its introduction occaſioned a great revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the theory and practice of phyſic.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:024987_0021_100A86737A66CA58"/>
Diſeaſes were now ſuppoſed to ariſe from a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant acid, or an alkali; and the various ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the human body, were attempted to be explained on the principles of <hi>fermentation</hi> or <hi>efferveſcence.</hi> Nay, they aſſerted that all the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Univerſe were explicable on che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical principles. At this period, many waſted their time and talents in the delirious purſuit of tranſmuting the baſer metals into gold.</p>
            <p>IN the beginning of the XVIIth century, the whole ſyſtem of Galen, as well as the theory of the chemiſts, was overturned by the diſcovery of the circulation of the blood by <hi>Harvey;</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated <hi>that the human body was an hydraulic machine, whoſe actions and offices depended upon the circulation of the blood, which alone being ſtopp'd, the whole muſt periſh.</hi> For, in this ſyſtem, the blood was conſidered as the <hi>primum mobile</hi> of the whole machine; and to ſomething in the blood were attributed all the diſorders to which we are liable. <hi>Harvey</hi> firſt made an application of this doctrine by publiſhing his <q>
                  <hi>practice of phyſic conformable to the laws of the circulation,</hi>
               </q> and by degrees all Europe followed him.</p>
            <p>THIS was the aera of experiment in which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral great geniuſes flouriſhed. Societies for promoting and diffuſing experimental knowledge were eſtabliſhed in different parts of Europe,

and patronized by monarchs.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The Engliſh Biſhops poſſeſſed the power of licencing practitioners of phyſic until the beginning of the 16th century, when this grievance was redreſſed by the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>London College of Phyſicians</hi> by an act of <hi>Henry</hi> viiith. By virtue of this authority it is expreſsly declared, that no one ſhall be permitted to exerciſe phyſic in any of the dioceſes in England till he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by the Preſident and three of the Elects, or <hi>Cenſors,</hi> and have letters teſtimonial from them; unleſs he be a <hi>graduate</hi> in either Univerſity, who, as ſuch, by his very degree, has a right to practiſe all over England. See Friend's hiſtory Phyſ. vol. 2. The <hi>Edinburgh royat College of Phyſicians</hi> was founded in 1681. It has ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar powers to the royal College of London. But that the rights of the Univerſity may not be infringed, their charter declares, that the College are to licence all perſons, who have taken their degrees in any of the Univerſities in Scotland—And that all perſons who have taken the degeee of Maſter of Arts in ſaid Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, or a degree of Doctor in any celebrated Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties abroad, ſhall, upon producing their reſpective Diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas to the Preſident and College, be licenced by them to practiſe phyſic within their juriſdiction, without paſſing a trial on that occaſion. See their charter in Mait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's hiſtory of Edinb. p. 376.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Royal Society of London</hi> was founded in 1663. <hi>L' Academic Royale de Sciences</hi> was erected in France 1666. The <hi>Academia Naturae Curioſorum</hi> was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in Germany in 1670. A royal literary ſociety was inſtituted at Berlin in 1711. Another at Peterſbourg 1725. The King of Sweden followed the example of Peter the great, and erected a literary academy in 1739, as did the King of Denmark in 1746. In 1731 an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy for ſurgery was founded in Paris. The preſent King founded the <hi>Royal Society for Medicine</hi> in 1776.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Univerſity of Paris,</hi> founded by <hi>Charlemagne</hi> in the year 800, was the firſt that conferred the degrees of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor and doctor in the year 1231. The <hi>Univerſity of Leyden</hi> was founded in 1574. It has twenty-ſix pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors. There is no college of Phyſicians in any of the United Provinces. Phyſicians, before they can be legally authoriſed to practiſe, are required to produce a Diploma from ſome Dutch Univerſity, which is regiſtered by the magiſtrates of the town in which they mean to reſide. Our <hi>Univerſity of Cambridge</hi> was founded in 1638, but the medical profeſſorſhips not till 1782.</p>
               </note> The <hi>art of printing</hi> had already produced a glorious change in the affairs of men.

Upon the diſcovery of any new principles by philoſophers or the introduction of any new and popular theory, phyſicians almoſt always attempt to apply them to the explanation of the actions of the human body, and all the cauſes of diſeaſes. Thus, when <hi>Galileo</hi> had introduced mathematical reaſoning, and excited the world to inveſtigate the laws of mechanics, phyſicians attempted to explain all the phaenomena of the animal oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, on mathematical and mechanical principles. The ſame was noticed concerning the chemiſts, and may be remarked at this time of the laws of electricity.</p>

THE famous <hi>Stabl</hi> perceiving the inſufficiency of the preceeding ſyſtems, maintained that the rational and immaterial ſoul was the true ſource of every function, both vital and natural. Thus experiment, or the uſe of our ſenſes, was diſcarded for a time from medicine, and metaphyſics, or reaſoning on probabilities, uſurped its place.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the ſtate of medicine when <hi>Boerhaave</hi> began to teach. The figure this great man made in the medical world, will juſtify our dwelling a little on his character and works. It is perhaps unneceſſary to ſay, that he was a profeſſor in the Univerſity of <hi>Leyden,</hi> and that he died about 50 years ago. <hi>Boerhaave</hi> was ſon of the pariſh mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a village near <hi>Leyden,</hi> and he himſelf was educated for that profeſſion. From the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his biographers and his own writings, we learn, that from the peruſal of early writers in divinity, he was ſtruck with the profoundeſt vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the ſimplicity and purity of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, and the ſanctity of their diſcipline; but as he deſcended to the lower ages, he found the peace of chriſtianity broken by uſeleſs controverſies, and its doctrines ſophiſticated by the ſubtleties of the ſchools. He found the holy writers interpreted according to the reigning philoſophers, and chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras of metaphyſicians adopted as articles of faith. He then quitted the purſuit of divinity,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024987_0025_100A867D472B3868"/>
and applied to the ſtudy of phyſic, when he was more than xxx years of age. But he found it nearly the ſame in phyſic as he experienced in divinity. He perceived that the moderns had widely deviated from the ſimplicity and purity of the antients; chimeras and idle notions adopted as articles of belief, or rules of practice, and the writings of the founder of our profeſſion ſtrangely corrupted and miſapplied.</p>
            <p>WHEN <hi>Boerhaave</hi> began to practiſe phyſic, he received but little encouragement. His buſineſs was at firſt very ſmall, and his circumſtances by no means eaſy. But ſuperior to every diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he continued his ſearch after truth and knowledge; determined that proſperity, were he ever to enjoy it, ſhould be the conſequence, not of mean artifice, cringing ſolicitation, or degrading complacency, but of real merit and ſolid learning. Nor was he diſappointed. After giving lectures at <hi>Leyden</hi> for a ſeries of years with great applauſe, his reputation bore ſome proportion to his merit, and extended itſelf to diſtant countries; inſomuch, that ſcarcely a learned ſociety in Europe, but was eager to elect him a member, ſcarcely a crowned head, but ſought ſome means to honor him. He died at Leyden in the year 1738, aged 79 years, leaving behind a glorious and untainted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.<note n="*" place="bottom">Schulten's life of Boerh. Med. Dict. Art.

BOERHAAVE'S <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> or <hi>theoritical</hi> work, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all the diſcoveries in anatomy and phyſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy known at that time; and whatever relates to the laws of the animal oeconomy and the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of medicines. His <hi>aphoriſms</hi> or <hi>practical</hi> work, are collected from the Greek medicinal writers, the Arabians and ſome of the Moderns; and his reaſonings are founded on the ſtructure of the parts and laws of mechanics. In his lectures on theſe aphoriſms he laboured to ſhew how na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acts in producing the ſymptoms of diſtempers, and her methods of relieving herſelf either with, or without the aſſiſtance of art. Perhaps it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes more medical knowledge, than any book extant of its ſize.</p>
            <p>THE moſt ſtriking feature in the Boerhaavian theory, is the explanation of all the phaenomena of the animal oeconomy on mechanical principles. It aſſerts, that the human body is truly a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical ſtructure, and poſſeſſes all the properties belonging to a ſubject beſt qualified for mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical ſpeculation; therefore a mechanical frame and that the human machine, is by the ſame laws explicable by geometry; and there is nothing, he thinks, in all its ſolids or fluids but what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable upon mathematical principles.</p>
            <p>HE founds his <hi>pathology,</hi> or <hi>doctrine of diſeaſes,</hi> on the change of the <hi>quality</hi> of the fluids, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſometimes a predominant <hi>acid,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024987_0027_100A8683C0A26638"/>
times a predominant <hi>alkali.</hi> Another fruitful ſource of diſeaſes, was a <hi>ſpontaneous gluten,</hi> or <hi>lentor</hi> in the fluids, and a too <hi>violent motion</hi> of the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating blood; this he ſuppoſed aroſe from the preternatural irritation of the heart, or from ſome acrimony preſent in the blood itſelf. Theſe opinions make the foundation of his theory of <hi>fevers</hi> and <hi>inflammations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt who ventured to attack the <hi>Boerhaavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſyſtem,</hi> was the learned Dr. <hi>Frederic Hoffman:</hi> who aſſerted that the body was ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the <hi>quality</hi> of the fluids, that the ſtate and <hi>craſis</hi> of the fluids themſelves, entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the <hi>nervous power;</hi> and that a flight alteration in this power was capable of inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly changing the blood, and all the other hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, into a different nature from what they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were. He therefore publiſhed it as his opinion "that the greater part of diſeaſes, if not all of them, were affections of the <hi>nervous ſyſtem."</hi> This hypotheſis, amplified and further illuſtrated, is the celebrated <hi>Cullenian Syſtem.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Encyclop. Brit. Art. <hi>Medicine.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>DR CULLEN, who died a year or two ſince in Scotland, after beſtowing great encomiums on <hi>Boerhaave,</hi> who he ſays improved and refined upon every thing that had before been offered, pointed out, as he ſuppoſed, the imperfections
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024987_0028_100A8686395CBCF8"/>
and deſiciencies of this famous ſyſtem, in order to ſhew the neceſſity of attempting a new one. And he has ſhewn pretty clearly, that the doctrine of <hi>acidity,</hi> and an <hi>alkali,</hi> is erroneous; and that the cauſes which <hi>Boerhaave</hi> adduces as producing the <hi>ſpontaneous gluten,</hi> are by no means probable. Nay, he aſſerts farther, that <hi>Boerhaave's</hi> doctrine of <hi>acrimony</hi> and <hi>lentor</hi> of the fluids is purely hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical; and that the reaſonings concerning them, are ſo far from improving phyſic, that they have often miſled the practice of it.</p>
            <p>THE brain is conſidered in the <hi>Cullenian hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis</hi> as the <hi>primary</hi> organ, on which the welfare of the ſyſtem <hi>principally</hi> depends; and the <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſyſtem,</hi> as the <hi>ſubſtratum,</hi> or fundamental <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of the whole body: for it ſuppoſes the living muſcular fibres to be a continuation of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the brain, or congeries of thoſe <hi>infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſimally</hi> ſmall threads called nerves.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> believed that the <hi>heart</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted the <hi>mainſpring</hi> of motion and ſenſation, but was unacquainted with the properties of the <hi>Nervous ſyſtem,</hi> which have been in a great meaſure overlooked by all his ſucceſſors until the time of Dr <hi>Thomas Willis,</hi> 1650.</note> Cullen conjectures, that the cortical part of the brain, or common origin of the nerves, is a <hi>ſecretory organ,</hi> in which the <hi>gluten</hi> of the blood, or <hi>coagulable lymph,</hi> being freed from all ſaline matter, before adhering to it, becomes fit for the nouriſhment of the ſolids,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024987_0029_100A8689A8185BC8"/>
and being poured in a ſufficiently diluted ſtate, upon the origin of the nerves, is filtrated along their fibres, and is thence conveyed to every part of the body for its nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>BY this ſyſtem, the circulation of the blood inſtead of being the <hi>principal,</hi> or vital function, as in the <hi>Boerhaavian,</hi> becomes ſo much a <hi>ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary</hi> one, in the animal oeconomy, that it ſerves little other purpoſe than the nutrition of the body. When a large blood-veſſel is wounded, the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the blood, cauſes a <hi>collaps</hi> of the veſſels, and death enſues: yet <hi>Cullen</hi> reminds us, that the veſſels muſt neceſſarily be in a certain ſtate of diſtention, in order that the nervous fluid ſhould move. * <hi>Boerhaave</hi> tells us, that when a perſon faints away, or lies ſome time under water, there is wanted a circumgiration of the liquors in the blood veſſels. <hi>Cullen</hi> admitting this, only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, that the firſt movement muſt ariſe in the nervous ſyſtem, which exciting the blood veſſels to action, they propel the fluids contained in them and life immediately returns, with heat, color, agility, <hi>cogilation,</hi> and every vital and natural ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hence we ſee that theſe eminent teachers meant the ſame thing, they only began the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in different parts of the circle. It would not be very difficult to prove, that both in their theory and their practice, the difference is more
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024987_0030_100A8687FA93B270"/>
in words, than in reality. <hi>Cullen</hi> conſiders almoſt all diſeaſes as ariſing from an affection of the <hi>nervous power.</hi> This power, or <hi>vis medicatrix natureae,</hi> is the ſame that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> calls "NATURE," whoſe efficacy he ſo much celebrates in removing diſeaſes; a power acknowledged and extolled by <hi>Boerhaave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſtate of ſcience is very different now from what it was 200 years ſince. The philoſophy of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> miſunderſtood, the falſe theories of <hi>Galen,</hi> and the jargon of the <hi>Chemiſts,</hi> formed ſo thick a cloud, that truth and nature could ſcarcely be ſeen through it. When this was diſpelled by <hi>Lord Bacon</hi> and others, the aera of experiment followed. Philoſophers and phyſicians labored to <hi>accumulate facts.</hi> Societies were every where eſtabliſhed for this expreſs purpoſe. A diffuſive manner of writing crept in, and grew up among authors. It was the faſhion to print not only all that a man thought, but to quote all that he found any body elſe thought: and he was ſcarcely eſteemed a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary man, who publiſhed any thing leſs than a folio. But now it is wholly different. Inſtead of that diffuſive manner of writing, authors feel the neceſſity of conſolidating and concentrating ſcience. They find that the ſubſtance of folios may be digeſted into a few pages, and the eſſence of libraries compreſſed within a few volumes.

            <p>SINCE knowledge has become more generally diffuſed, a benevolent philoſophy, ſubſervient to life and public utility, has taken the place of thoſe theological diſputations, which diſtracted the laſt century. A ſpirit of free iniquiry diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes the medical, and other profeſſions. The authority of great names is leſs venerated. The world begins to grow weary of theories which lead to no uſeful conſequences, and have no foundation but in the imagination of ingenious men.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gregory's comparative view.</note>

            <p>MUCH literary as well as political advantages have accrued to the UNITED STATES, and to thoſe of <hi>New-England</hi> in particular, from the <hi>American

Revolution.</hi> It had been heretofore thought indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to reſort to foreign univerſities, to complete the ſyſtem of medical education, and to acquire <hi>there</hi> the theory and practice of phyſic, which the want of regular ſchools and eſtabliſhed hoſpitals in this country, rendered unattainable. At that period, an ambition of acquiring the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt qualifications in the profeſſion, naturally led the medical ſtudent to the celebrated European Schools: and the honors they beſtowed, were conſidered as conferring diſtinction and reſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility on the candidates. The ambition was laudable. But it muſt at the ſame time be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that from the novelty of ſituation, it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times failed of being followed by the advantages expected; and the expence attending it was a circumſtance, which muſt neceſſarily have cram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their exertions.</p>
            <p>THE various inſtitutions founded within a few years in this commonwealth, have laid a broad foundation for improvement in ſcience, and the arts: and the eſtabliſhment of a MEDICAL SCHOOL in the UNIVERSITY at CAMBRIDGE, by affording regular means of inſtruction, in the different branches of the profeſſion, has given to the <hi>preſent</hi> a decided ſuperiority over <hi>former</hi> times, and in a great degree has forever precluded the neceſſity of a foreign education.</p>

A country ſo completely independent in other reſpects as the <hi>United States,</hi> however ready to receive information in the higher grades of ſcience, by the cultivation of literary correſpondences abroad, ſhould bluſh to be indebted to foreign ſeminaries for the <hi>firſt principles of profeſſional inſtruction.</hi>

            <p>OF the various methods of cultivating and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing medical knowledge, none is more deſirable, than an amicable aſſociation of neighbouring practiotiners; eſpecially when their aim is mutual improvement and the good of mankind. Theſe generous ſentiments gave birth to the <hi>Middleſex Medical Aſſociation;</hi> a ſociety whoſe grand object is to improve our art by a free and friendly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of our ſkill and experience, and to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate thoſe manly ſentiments, which tend to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate narrow prejudices and unworthy practices.</p>
            <p>A military ſpark, which was firſt ſtruck out in <hi>this County,</hi> burſt into a flame and ſpread through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the continent. This till then almoſt unnoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced part of the world, drew the attention of all nations, who regarded us with admiration, while we conquered armies, and founded ſuch an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire as the world has never ſeen, and framed a conſtitution, which is the pride of man, and glory of the human underſtanding. The European world

ſtill regards us: many with an anxious ſolicitude to ſee in what order and degree thoſe <hi>diſpoſitions</hi> and arts, which characterize poliſhed humanity ariſe among us. They cannot but obſerve that the County ſo famous for having <hi>firſt</hi> dared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt what they deemed to be deſpotiſm, ſtands the firſt in the cultivation of thoſe arts which grace ſocial life and encreaſe human happineſs. MID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DLESEX, ſo diſtinguiſhed for its Univerſity and for its <hi>Militia;</hi> ſo celebrated in arts and arms, will we doubt not, ſtill continue to take a liberal pride in promoting thoſe arts which improve the world and dignify mankind.</p>
            <p>A noble example is afforded in your worthy townſman Dr. <hi>Cuming.</hi> You who were his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens muſt feel at the mention of his name the tender remembrance of friendſhip reviving in your breaſts! you, who recollect him the ſenſible, generous, warmhearted, upright friend; the able honeſt and experienced phyſician! Dr. <hi>Cuming</hi> poſſeſſed an underſtanding fraught with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his profeſſion, happily blended with great benevolence. And his generous donation to the medical branch of your Univerſity, while it excites <hi>our</hi> gratitude ſufficiently evinces his opinion of the importance, and practibility of a complete medical education within ourſelves.</p>

ANIMATED by the example of the <hi>Eminent,</hi> who have gone before us, let us preſs on to ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improvements. Let us leave the flowery path of ſpeculation for the more arduous one of experiment. That benevolent philoſophy which diſtinguiſhes this age, and this country, will help us to cultivate and diffuſe the benefits of the art we profeſs, and inſpire us with the pleaſing hope of being able to preſerve to our fellow creatures, that greateſt of bleſſings, "A SOUND MIND, IN A SOUND BODY."—The field is extenſive, the charge important, and the calling honourable.</p>
