            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In order to attain this object, the thick ſettled Indies were depopulated, to make room for a race of ſlaves obtained by exciting wars, maſſacres, and every ſpecies of devaſtation among the quiet inhabitants on the coaſt of Africa. Thouſands of thoſe have periſhed on their paſſage; other thouſands after their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; and' what was wanting to fill up the meaſure of iniquity, has been ſupplied by whipping and ſtarvation. And when to theſe, we add the numerous inſtances of women being reduced to beggary, children to want, and men to brutes, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious uſe of ſpirituous liquors, drawn from the ſame ſource (the ſugar cane.)

It was upon this principle, that our Conventions endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to form both the State and Federal Conſtitutions: But as eminent a monument of human wiſdom as the Federal Conſtitution may be, it yet contains a certain clauſe, which the benevolent mind can never contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate, but with deteſtation.</p>

A ſhort paraphraſe on this remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able clauſe, perhaps may read nearly as follows:</p>
            <q>Although our Conſtitution is built on principles, which have for their baſis the perfect equality of man: Although we hold that freedom is the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of every individual of the human race, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031720_0033_0FEE1BBF4A7F87D0"/>
may be his country, or his color: Although we maintain that no perſon has any legal authority over another, but what is derived from the voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the perſon over whom it is exerciſed: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we believe that when one perſon attempts to uſurp authority over another, that it is not only the right, but the duty of the injured perſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt: Although we hold that tyranny is the greateſt of curſes and vices; and that liberty is the greateſt of bleſſings—Yet we believe, that the Negroes of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, becauſe they are black, and we are white—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is neceſſary for us to live in genteel refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at the expenſe of the miſery of the ſtupid negroes—becauſe liberty and property are our rights, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily extinguiſh theirs: We therefore maintain it to be perfectly right and juſt, to keep them and their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to languiſh in hopeleſs bondage, without the leaſt right or title to the profits of their labor, or the liberty of their perſons; and that whenever they make the leaſt attempt to reſiſt our authority, or to regain their liberty, to puniſh them, or put them to death, as the caſe may require. And that whereas there are not enough of theſe wretched victims in the United States, this land of liberty and equality; (Though there are near ſeven hundred thouſand) we will not prohibit, but will virtually gurantee the ſlave trade, that is we will allow our merchants and our ſailors to go to the defenceleſs ſhores of Africa, and either by fraud or violence, or whatever way you can, ſeize upon the wretched natives, (though as innocent as to any injury they ever did us, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are in Heaven) take fathers, aged trembling fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031720_0034_0FEE1BC83A38C900"/>
from their wretched ſtarving children!— Weeping children, from their agonizing parents!— Huſbands from their ſhrieking, diſtracted wives!— Wives from the embraces of their tender wiſhful huſbands! Lover and friend, from his wiſhed for mate! Take them men, women and children, load them with irons, and crowd them promiſcuouſly into a ſtifled ſtinking hole. There feed them on their paſſage with the bread of affliction—if they are ſullen perhaps you may knock them in the head, and throw their mangled bodies to the ſharks! When you have arrived in the free zone of America, that aſſylum of the oppreſſed, immediately advertiſe that you have a cargo of human beings for ſale; when the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer arrives, let him examine them as critically, and with as much decency as if they were oxen, or cows, then let him take them to his plantations, and aſſign to each his burden. Let them toil inceſſantly in in the burning ſummer's fun. Let them ſhiver with naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the rigorous and inclement winter. Let the cruel the unfeeling taſk-maſter raiſe them by the break of day, with the crack of his whip. Let its diſcipline be extended over them during the day, and for a ſmall fault or miſtake, let their backs be 'whipt to a jelly. Let the aged female while bending over her ſpade, and worn out with enormous hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, be ſpurred on to a nimbler pace by the cruel whip. Let a ſmall portion of Indian corn, a few yams or potatoes, be their principal food, whilſt ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated with hunger, and exhauſted by ceaſeleſs and 'nſupportable labor, 'til death the often implored 'and moſt welcome meſſenger, preaches to them the principles of equality indeed.</q>
