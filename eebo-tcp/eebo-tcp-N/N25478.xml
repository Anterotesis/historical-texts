            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>GENESIS XIIth CHAPTER, 2d. VERSE.</bibl>
               <q>AND I WILL MAKE OF THEE A GREAT NATION.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE paſſage now read contains a part of that promiſe, which God made to Abraham, when he commanded him to depart from his country and from his kindred and from his father's houſe, and to ſojourn in a ſtrange land. To induce him to comply with this command of heaven, he is aſſured that he ſhall become a great nation, and ſhall be raiſed to diſtinguiſhed heights of honor, happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and renown. I will make of thee a great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſays Jehovah, and I will bleſs thee, and make thy name great; and thou ſhalt be a bleſſing. And I will bleſs them that bleſs thee, and curſe him that curſeth thee. This promiſe we find fulfilled in the nation of the Jews. From ſmall beginning they roſe to national greatneſs and happineſs. They were for a long period, a great, happy and flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing people. Under the protection of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, they were ſecure againſt the invaſion of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033813_0004_0FF9568642B7A5F0"/>
enemies. God ſuffered no man to do them harm. He frequently appeared for their protection and deliverance, in times of danger and calamity. He gave them a land flowing with milk and honey and indulged them with all thoſe temporal delights, which are neceſſary to comfort, pleaſure and ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction. God choſe them for his peculiar people and diſtinguiſhed them from all the nations of the earth, in regard to religious privileges. He made them acquainted with his perfections and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in their duty. Unto them pertained the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the ſervice of God, and the promiſes.</p>
            <p>THUS was the promiſe fulfilled. God made of Abraham a great nation.</p>
            <p>IN the ſequel of this diſcourſe, I ſhall endeavor, as the words before us will naturally lead me, to ſhew what is neceſſary to render a nation great, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſenſe of our text.</p>
            <p>THE requiſites of national greatneſs are many and various. In one diſcourſe it will not be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I ſhould notice them all. To make ſome general obſervations upon the ſubject is all that can reaſonably be required.</p>
            <p>THAT a nation may become great, proſperous and happy it is neceſſary that they form into ſociety and eſtabliſh a conſtitution of civil government, that ſhall be beſt adapted to the general good. What form of government is the beſt and moſt eligible has been diſputed in all civilized nations, by men of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and penetration. "Some have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033813_0005_0FF956C561C147F8"/>
with a monarchical form, others have choſen an ariſtocratical; while others, have given the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a more popular mode of government."</p>
            <p>THE intereſts, manners, cuſtoms and prejudices of mankind are ſo variable, that it is very difficult to determine what frame of government will be moſt promotive of the good of any people. But I think we may ſafely affirm that to be the beſt conſtitution, which abridges the liberties of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple no further, than is neceſſary to their ſafety, proſperity and political happineſs. Under ſuch a conſtitution, perſons are ſafe in their intereſt, hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and property. Authority, when exerciſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the general and important end of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be remanded and return into the hands of the people. But the greatneſs and happineſs of a nation depend as much, if not more, on a wiſe and faithful adminiſtration, than on any particular form of government.</p>
            <p>THAT a people may experience the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a wiſe and good adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is neceſſary that their rulers be men of knowledge, integrity and religion. It is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that men, who are inveſted with the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority, ought to have ſome acquaintance with mankind, with hiſtory and with the various modes of adminiſtration in different nations. But, eſpecially, it is incumbent on civil rulers to be well acquainted with the conſtitution of the ſtate in which they live. Without this knowledge they muſt be liable to many errors; and while they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033813_0006_0FF9570321505DB8"/>
to do eſſential ſervice to the community, they may be purſuing meaſures, which tend directly to deſtroy its happineſs. We pretend not that it is neceſſary civil rulers ſhould be perſons of collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate education. But they ought, at leaſt, to be men of good underſtanding, that have a competent knowledge of the rights of mankind, and the nature of government. Ignorant men, men deſtitute of theſe qualifications, will, if raiſed to places of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and truſt, be a curſe, inſtead of a bleſſing to the community. They will be little more than mean inſtruments in the hands of men of crafty intrigue. A few individuals, in this caſe, will govern the ſtate and a great part of the public loſe the benefit of an equal repreſentation. That perſons, who are elected officers of government, ought to be men of knowledge and good underſtanding, we are taught not only by experience, but by revelation. The Jews were commanded "to take wiſe men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and known among their tribes, and to make them rulers over them." On the other hand, it was conſidered as a great and heavy judgment, when weak and ignorant men were raiſed to ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of power and authority. "Woe unto thee, O land, when thy king is a child."</p>
            <p>SOLOMON, when called to ſit upon the throne of his father David, prayed that God would give him a wiſe and underſtanding heart, that he might be able to judge ſo great a people.</p>
            <p>IF the greateſt degrees of political knowledge are not an eſſential qualification in a ruler, yet he is unfit to be placed at the head of public affairs, who is of inferior abilities, who is unacquainted
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033813_0007_0FF95732D1CB9A60"/>
with the conſtitution of the State in which he lives, and who knows not what it is to act right; for he is very liable to abuſe his power, and to encroach upon the rights and privileges of the people.</p>
            <p>"IN free governments, one obſerves, men are apt to feel, much quicker, than in thoſe of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent form. To touch their liberties, is to touch the apple of their eye, every attempt alarms them, and makes them jealous of further deſigns, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times throws them into the hands of factious dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, who are enemies to all government, and are ever watching opportunities to embarraſs public meaſures and to introduce anarchy and confuſion. Where ſo much, therefore, depends, and where the danger of acting wrong is likely to produce ſuch miſchievous effects in the community, rulers ought to know very well what it is to act right; where power ends and liberty begins. The more difficult it is to ſettle this point, ſo much the more wiſdom, knowledge and prudence do rulers need, and ſo much the more cautious ſhould they be in their political conduct.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER indiſpenſable qualification in rulers is integrity. The proſperity of ſociety is in their hands, and the greater their wiſdom and knowledge are, the more capable they are of deſtroying the intereſt of the community.</p>
            <p>IF we have any knowledge of the hiſtory of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we cannot be ignorant of the unhappy and ruinous effects of raiſing to ſtations of power and truſt men of no integrity, of baſe and corrupt minds, of low art and intrigue. The moſt fatal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033813_0008_0FF9576ADDDBEBC0"/>
in ſociety have originated from this cauſe.—How many nations, which once enjoyed the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of freedom and equal liberty, have either ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered national annihilation, or been reduced to the moſt abject ſlavery by men of this deſcription? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, where has the nation exiſted, that has been, for a long period, free and happy, while diſhoneſt and unfaithful men were at the head of its public affairs? It cannot be named. But hiſtory furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us with an account of many ſtates and empires, which have been involved in the greateſt miſeries, and finally were deſtroyed by means of corrupt and wicked rulers.</p>
            <p>THE republic of Sparta, which flouriſhed for almoſt ſeven hundred years, and bid defiance to the world, was at laſt thrown from the height of polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical glory and happineſs into the abyſs of miſery and ſlavery by unprincipled and intriguing men.</p>
            <p>THE ruin of the famous republic of Rome origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from the ſame cauſe. While the reins of government were in the hands of upright and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful men, ſhe flouriſhed and was miſtreſs of the world; but when perſons of the oppoſite charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were placed at the helm of ſtate, ſhe loſt her happineſs, ſunk into diſgrace, and became a ſlave.</p>
            <p>PERFECTLY agreeable to the dictates of reaſon, is that obſervation, "that nothing will ſo ſurely, ſo rapidly bring on the diſſolution of ſociety and the loſs of the liberties of the people, as want of integrity in rulers."</p>
            <p>THE divine oracles, which give us the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033813_0009_0FF957A75A37DE48"/>
how to ſecure our preſent, as well as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs, inform us that "rulers muſt be juſt men, fearers of God, haters of covetouſneſs. That, they ſhake their hands from holding bribes, becauſe a gift blindeth the eyes of the wiſe, and perverteth the words of the righteous."</p>
            <p>REASON and revelation, then concur in ſupport of this truth, that integrity in civil rulers is an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential qualification, and that they only will be miniſters of God for good to the people, who are men of integrity, uprightneſs and honeſty.</p>
            <p>WE proceed to obſerve, that religion is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant qualification in civil rulers. This finiſhes their character. This renders them acceptable to God, and makes them bleſſings to ſociety.</p>
            <p>RELIGION is neceſſary to the honor, uſefulneſs and happineſs of all moral agents; but religion is peculiarly requiſite for civil rulers. It adds a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to their character, commands the eſteem and veneration of the community, and makes them, what they ought to be, bleſſings to ſociety. Of ſuch importance is religion in civil rulers, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it the beſt genius and the greateſt knowledge would endanger the welfare of the State, rather than promote the intereſt and happineſs of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. Men of enlightened minds and corrupt hearts, men of knowledge, but void of piety and the fear of God, are very unſuitable perſons to be entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the affairs and concerns of a republic. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who fear not God and obey not the goſpe of his ſon will not regard man, nor conſult the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and well being of civil ſociety any further,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033813_0010_0FF957E77AC98B98"/>
than what is neceſſary to their own aggrandize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the accompliſhment of their own private views.</p>
            <p>BUT that a nation may become great, it is not only neceſſary, that they have wiſe upright and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rulers, but the people alſo muſt ſubmit to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful authority and equitable laws. The doctrine of non reſiſtance and paſſive obedience, we reject with abhorrence. A people cannot, in juſtice be obligated to ſubmit to oppreſſive and tyrannical laws. When laws are unjuſt, not well adapted to the circumſtances of the community, and when a compliance with them would be attended with ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects injurious to the public, the people have a right firſt to remonſtrate and then refuſe ſubmiſſion. But this right belongs only to the majority, the ruling body of the State, and not to any minority. If this principle be not eſtabliſhed, all civil order is in danger of being brought to an end. When perſons enter into ſociety and combine in civil government, they oblige themſelves to ſubmit to the laws of the State, and it is trifling with ſociety and government to refuſe ſubmiſſion. It is relaſping into a ſtate of nature and ſubverting the very conſtitution and baſis of ſociety. Obedience to civil authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is abſolutely neceſſary to the very being of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, and every one is an enemy to his country, who refuſes ſubmiſſion to its laws.</p>
            <p>BUT it is of equal importance to national great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that laws wiſely enacted and well adapted, be faithfully executed. Laws are not only neceſſary to the good order and proſperity of a community,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033813_0011_0FF9581B9551AC10"/>
but they muſt alſo be executed. Without this, they are perfectly uſeleſs. Perſons, who diſobey the laws of the community, ought to be noticed and brought to juſtice.</p>
            <p>IN every State officers are elected and authoriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to detect and bring to puniſhment offenders, and every officer is highly criminal, who neglects this his political duty, who connives at and paſſes by breaches of law; for by this neglect he violates his promiſe and injures the community. He is an enemy to the State, and ought to be deprived of his authority and commiſſion. Unleſs the laws of a community are put in force and the executive authority is exerciſed, the legiſlature will become contemptible and the State loſe the advantages of civil ſociety. Laws will never be obeyed without ſanctions, and perſons will never be deterred from violating them, unleſs criminals be puniſhed. Therefore, no act of diſobedience ought to be countenanced, when the intereſt of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is threatened. Conniving at one act of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will open the way for another, and finally, all violations of law may paſs unpuniſhed, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and every evil work may enter ſociety, and property, and even life itſelf become very inſecure.</p>
            <p>BENEVOLENCE or public ſpirit, an attachment to the body politic and the general good, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to partial views, is requiſite to national great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The grand political object, the good of the whole, ought to be kept in view and animate and direct the conduct of every individual. Perſons, however, in promoting the intereſt of ſociety are
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033813_0012_0FF95842DE9C1328"/>
not bound to ſacrifice all private views, and to act wholly from public motives. Self-preſervation is the firſt law of nature, and to have regard to our own individual happineſs is perfectly conſiſtent with a true love to our country. Every member of civil ſociety may always ſeek to promote his own intereſt, when it is not attended with injury to the community. But when by any act of this kind the intereſt of the community ſuffers, ſuch act becomes unlawful and the author of it is governed by unjuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable motives. A ſelfiſh ſpirit in civil ſociety is deſtructive both of private and public intereſt, and were this ſpirit univerſally to prevail, ſociety would be ſubverted from its baſis, private intereſt would be the purſuit of all and the public good engage the attention of none.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER eſſential requiſite of national great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is domeſtic peace and concord. The happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of civil ſociety very much depends upon its u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. A people may be numerous and wealthy, they may be favoured with a good form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and with wiſe, upright and religious rulers; yet if domeſtic contentions and quarrels prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, their proſpects of national glory and happineſs muſt be very gloomy. Their national ſtrength will be continually decreaſing, their wealth conſuming, and they, in time, muſt fall a prey to their enemies. Hiſtory and experience abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirm the truth of our ſaviour's aſſertion "a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom divided againſt itſelf cannot ſtand." A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when united may probably ſtand againſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of their enemies, but when they are divided
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033813_0013_0FF95860061AC650"/>
among themſelves, when ſtrife and contentions are prevalent, they muſt fall. One great cauſe of the ſubvertion of the Jewiſh ſtate and government was diviſion. They were, it is true, obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with a powerful enemy. But they might have withſtood the attack of the Romans and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come victorious, if in heart and meaſures they had been united. The Jewiſh hiſtory furniſhes us with an account of that moſt horrible deſtruction, which the Roman army made of this unhappily divided people. Every one's ſword was turned againſt his fellow; and they made but a feeble and ſhort reſiſtance. They were ſoon brought to deſolation. Their cities were ravaged and conſumed by fire, and their government was wholly ſubverted. The like diviſions are generally productive of ſimilar effects. Contentions in ſociety are much to be dreaded and ſtudiouſly avoided. They, when kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, are like fire, they increaſe their own flame; where they will terminate and what will be their effects, none can determine. They muſt injure, and they may iſſue in the diſſolution of Society.</p>
            <p>BUT let me obſerve further, that a ſpirit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry among the members of a community is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to national greatneſs.</p>
            <p>EVERY excellent and mental accompliſhment is the reſult of enquiry and application. By diligence only can arts and ſciences be carried to perfection; and induſtry is the means, by which the neceſſaries, conveniences, and accommodations of life are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Reaſon and experience teach us that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry is conducive to national glory and proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033813_0014_0FF95870A1E14B48"/>
It is this that leads to honor, to wealth, to wiſdom, and to that bravery and magnanimity, which are eſſentially neceſſary to political happineſs; and defence againſt the invaſion of enemies. But idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the parent of poverty, cowardice, weakneſs, ignorance, and every evil that infeſts human ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. It is induſtry, that ſupports rulers and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that ſupplies the wants of the needy and fills the garners of the wealthy, that keeps in motion the wheels of government and ſupports ſociety. "There cannot be a flouriſhing people without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, whatever other advantages they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; for without this the benefits of nature muſt be, in a great meaſure, loſt and the bleſſings of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence thrown away. There are flouriſhing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the world, that wholly owe their power and proſperity, next to the bleſſing of heaven, to their being remarkably induſtrious, which has raiſed and advanced them in ſpite of many great obſtacles and diſcouraging difficulties, that ſtood in their way; and there are other nations which, notwithſtanding many and great national advantages, have never diſtinguiſhed themſelves for want of taking the pains neceſſary thereto: Their ſloth has kept them down and buried them in obſcurity, they have fallen a ſacrifice to their inactivity." "The hand of the diligent ſhall bear rule, but the ſlothful ſhall be under tribute."</p>
            <p>But we proceed to obſerve, that a proper atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the means of education and knowledge is neceſſary to national greatneſs. Knowledge is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the practice of every private and public
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033813_0015_0FF95882F68A14F8"/>
virtue. A diſpoſition to do well, without knowing how to perform, can be but of little uſe. In the early ages of the world the civil ſtate of mankind was much more imperfect, than it is at this more enlightened period. Mankind were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with the rights of human nature. The arts and ſciences were little cultivated. The principles of benevolence and ſociability lay dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, for want of exerciſe and improvement. The minds of men were barbarous and their manners unſocial. In this ſtate of ignorance they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of forming at beſt, only ſmall combinations, and a few families conſtituted a nation.</p>
            <p>They were deſtitute of that knowledge, which is neceſſary to forming extenſive empires, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them in oppoſition to the influence of fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This mode of living was not much prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that, which is practiced in a ſtate of nature. Their uncultivated minds would not admit of their becoming wealthy and powerful; and their genius was exerted moſtly to deſtroy thoſe who oppoſed them. But by attending to the means of knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge mankind have made the moſt valuable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements. They have enlarged their ideas of living and becoming great and honorable. The rights of human nature are better underſtood, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ariſing from cultivating the arts and ſciences have been ſenſibly felt. If we may judge of the improvements poſſible to be made by nations, from the improvements in paſt ages, we may reaſonably ſuppoſe that knowledge may ſo hereafter increaſe, as to put an end to moſt of the evils that grow out
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033813_0016_0FF9588DC4BB9410"/>
of civil combinations and governments, and unite all the nations of the earth in bonds of perpetual peace and love.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>" Then nation ſhall no more 'gainſt nation riſe,</l>
               <l>" Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes,</l>
               <l>" Nor fields with gleaming ſteel be cover'd o'er,</l>
               <l>" The brazen trumpets kindle rage no more;</l>
               <l>" But uſeleſs lances into ſcythes ſhall bend,</l>

            </lg>
            <p>WE may further obſerve, that a free and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive commerce is neceſſary to national greatneſs.</p>
            <p>IT is a rare thing that one country or kingdom will afford its inhabitants all the neceſſaries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and ornaments of life. Different ſoils are compoſed of different properties, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for different production. One country, therefore, muſt be dependent on others for its produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by way of commerce; and this may be done without injury to any, but, on the contrary, with great advantage to all.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH there are few countries, perhaps none that produces every thing neceſſary to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize a nation, yet it may produce many things, that are, in a degree ſuperfluous and may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for other commodities more neceſſary, uſeful and ornamental. In this way the wants of one country may be ſupplied by the ſuperfluities of another. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>tions of the earth, in the preſent age of the world, have much greater advantages in point of commerce, than the nations, that exiſted a few centuries before them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:033813_0017_0FF9589C2BF9A120"/>
THEY had then made but ſmall improvements in the art of navigation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is neceſſary to a large, commodious and profitable commerce with diſtant countries. But the nations of the earth have now made ſuch improvement in the art of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation as enables them to carry on the buſineſs of commerce with eaſe, dispatch and general ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>BUT we may obſerve, that martial power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to national greatneſs. In the preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate of things, no nation is to expect to be always exempt from the unjuſt attacks of foreign enemies. Small occaſions are often productive of diſcord and warlike contentions. A nation ought, therefore, ever to be in a capacity to act with vigour in its own defence.</p>
            <p>THEY ought to be well acquainted with the arts of war; and to put their country in a proper poſture of defence by ſea and land. They ought to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain finances, amply anſwering to the pecuniary exigences of the State; to anſwer with fidelity and diſpatch the juſt demands of thoſe, who riſque their lives in the defence of their country. This is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to national honor and ſafety.</p>
            <p>WE obſerve further, that if a people would be great and happy, they muſt be careful of their civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il rights and privileges. The ſubjects of a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican government muſt to ſecure their liberties and perpetuate their happineſs be attentive to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical rights, and with prudence and caution diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their duty at free and popular elections. It is not difficult, many times, for men of crafty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033813_0018_0FF958AED79717D0"/>
to obtain offices of importance, and to prevent the operation of the beſt civil conſtitution and laws. Bribery and an undue influence in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections may have this effect. A free and unbiaſſed election is the grand bulwark of natural and civil liberty. And when a people give their ſuffrages in favor of crafty, ignorant and unprincipled men, they are deſtitute of that love to their country, which is neceſſary to ſecure the continuance of its liberties and independence. They do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that when the wicked, unſkilful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing bear rule, the liberties of the ſubjects are in danger and the people have reaſon to mourn; and that when the righteous, men of knowledge, integrity and religion are in authority, theſe lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erties are ſecure and the people may rejoice. It cannot be denied, that ſome perſons, who have lived under a free and popular government, have diſcovered great depravity of ſoul by trifling with their civil privileges and ſelling their birthright for a meſs of pottage, or a more contemptible com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation. But all, who are true friends to their country, will reject with abhorrence the idea of bribery in elections or giving their votes in favor of any men for public offices, but perſons of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, integrity and religion. They will weep, that there ſhould be the leaſt reaſon to fear that their fellow citizens will ever become regardleſs of their right of elections, or indifferent to the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the perſons, whom they elect for their civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il rulers; that offices of truſt, honor and profit ſhould become venal, and that the ignorant, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033813_0019_0FF958BE223E4028"/>
and irreligious ſhould be as fair &amp; eligible candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates as the wiſe, modeſt and virtuous. They will deteſt the man who attempts to buy their vote, or ſeeks to obtain the honors of his country by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other means, than that of merit.</p>
            <p>WE obſerve once more, that religion is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to national greatneſs and proſperity.</p>
            <p>RELIGION is the baſis of public, as well as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate happineſs. A body politic cannot have a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſubſiſtence, without the practice of virtue. "Godlineſs is profitable to all things." It is this that exalteth a nation; "but ſin is the reproach of any people." According as virtue or vice prevail, ſo will a people proſper or decay. Vice and iniquity are the grand inſtruments of deſtruction in every po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical conſtitution. They generally have the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and effect of natural cauſes. But righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is productive of oppoſite effects. It inſures the protection and bleſſing of the great Governor of the univerſe. It is the only durable baſis of good government, of good laws, of mutual confidence, and proſperity. Where this prevails a people will not fail to riſe to the higheſt degrees of national glory and felicity. The pillars of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be as durable as the hills and their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as laſting as time.</p>
            <p>No man, therefore, can better evidence his love for his country, than by endeavouring, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſphere, to prevent the contagious ſpread of vice, or to promote the influence of morality and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. "Contemptible is that man's pretended love to his country who with an oſtentatious zeal for her
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033813_0020_0FF8D3D4E8739F10"/>
credit, her finances, or civil eſtabliſhments, entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſregards that which is the baſis of the whole.</p>
            <p>HE is like the man who is careful to repair and adorn ſome leſs eſſential parts of a building, whilſt he ſuffers the foundation to be undermined, which failing the whole tumbles into ruins."</p>
            <p>THE truth of theſe obſervations is confirmed by the univerſal hiſtory of mankind.</p>
            <p>THE Jews, we are aſſured by hiſtory, were a happy and flouriſhing people, while they were gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by principles of piety and virtue. While they were willing and obedient they ate the good of the land. Iſrael then dwelt in ſafety; the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Jacob was upon a land of corn and wine; his heavens dropped down dew; the Lord was the ſhield of his help, and the ſword of his excellency. But, when the Jews became abandoned to vice, when irreligion prevailed among them, the Lord forſook them; and their glory and happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted. They became an eaſy prey to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. They were carried into captivity, and final deſtruction was the fate of their policy, church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>To the ſame cauſe the corruption, of morals and principles, may be traced the complete ruin of the republics of Athens and Rome.</p>
            <p>As long as temperance, frugality, chaſtity, and other virtues were national, and ſpread among them, they flouriſhed and increaſed; but when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and profaneneſs, luxury and debauchery formed their public character and manners their empire immediately began to decline and decay.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033813_0021_0FF958DB161D7BD8"/>
Their national glory continued to decreaſe 'till it was entirely loſt, their conſtitution was wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and thoſe, who ſurvived the deſtruction of their government were left to groan under the rod of cruel and barbarous tyrants. A corruption of manners and numerous crimes, ſays a writer, made greater havoc in the city of Rome, than the mightieſt armies could have done, and in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner avenged the conquered globe.</p>
            <p>THESE are ſome of the evil effects of irreligion and immorality, with reſpect to the well being of civil ſociety. May Americans take warning and avoid the rocks, upon which ſo many thouſands have been daſhed in pieces.</p>
            <p>FROM the preceeding obſervations, may not the people of America felicitate themſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the moſt pleaſing hopes of their future na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional greatneſs? We poſſeſs at preſent many of the advantages which prepare the way for national importance. The climate of the United States is favourable to health and population. Our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neither within the torrid or frigid zone, but the temperate. Whilſt we are warned by winds ſtretching over a large extent of country from the equator, the heat is tempered by cooling breezes from the ſea and more northern climes. We are alſo favoured with a country fertile in its ſoil. There are but few countries ſuited to every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; nor can we ſuppoſe this is the caſe with America. But its productions are ſufficient to ſupply the wants and many of the luxuries of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life; and to furniſh ample materials for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033813_0022_0FF958E4F847C6A0"/>
Diligence and oeconomy in the common claſs of people is one portrait in our national char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. Improvements in the arts and ſciences are increaſing, and knowledge is progreſſing. The ſeveral States have not only civil conſtitutions founded on equal rights, but they are combined in one general federation under a national conſtitution of government, which ſerves to unite the wiſdom, the wealth and the power of the whole, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, the defence and aggrandizement of the nation. We have the power of appointing our governors, ſenators, legiſlators, and magiſtrates, our laws are made and executed by perſons elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by, and from among ourſelves.</p>
            <p>WE are alſo favoured with the moſt exalted reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious privileges and liberties. We have a revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from heaven, containing the moſt excellent ſyſtem of doctrines and precepts, and the moſt weighty motives to piety and virtue. We enjoy without moleſtation the rights of conſcience, every one may judge for himſelf in matters of faith, and may chooſe ſuch mode of worſhip as his reaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſcience may dictate.</p>
            <p>THESE are national advantages and bleſſings, which we have received of God and which we hold under the protection of his good providence. But our long enjoying them ultimately depends on a reaſonable and religious improvement of them.</p>
            <p>A republican government eſſentially depends on public virtue. Where there is a general want of virtue in the people and adminiſtrators of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it becomes feeble and contemptible; &amp; muſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033813_0023_0FF955C66D69A7F8"/>
ſoon be diſſolved. Whether there be ſufficient virtue in the people and adminiſtrators of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in theſe United States long to maintain it, in its preſent form, time and experience only can aſcertain.</p>
            <p>WE as a people have enjoyed a great degree of political happineſs for many years. But our future proſpects of national happineſs are not ſo flattering as what they have been in time paſt. The republic of France has been, and ſtill is attempting to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt our proſperity. Proud, imperious and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Britain has attempted the ſame; but ſhe has promiſed us reparation, and has ceaſed to inſult us. France continues her abuſes and greatly annoys our happineſs, and inſtead of diſcovering the leaſt diſpoſition to make us ſatisfaction, inſultingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands money, money from us to reward her for the infamous treatment, which ſhe has offered to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. It is not neceſſary to remind you of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations which have, for ſome years paſt, been made upon our commerce by European nations. I preſume they are freſh in your memories. But, I would call your attention to that which is both our duty and happineſs, to love and defend our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. We are not Europeans, but Americans. Let us prove ourſelves to be worthy of the name by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering a ſtrong and firm attachment to the honor and happineſs of our nation.</p>
            <p>IT ought to be our prayer that thoſe, who are at the head of our government, may have wiſdom from above to direct; and it is a matter of the greateſt importance that we be united among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033813_0024_0FF958F2970A8770"/>
and be reconciled to the adminiſtrations of our national government; and cheerfully unite our ſtrength to ſupport our independence, our rights and liberties againſt the invaſion of a foreign en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy.</p>
            <p>IT is ſaid, that France befriended us in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt with Britain, and that we are indebted to her for our ſalvation. It is not my deſign to enter into the political diſputes of the preſent day; but I will venture to aſſert we cannot be under obligations to reſign our liberties to any nation, whether ſhe may have been a friend or a foe. It is our duty to defend our liberties and ſupport our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt the aſſaults of all enemies. We ought to lay aſide all prejudices and contentions, and in heart and meaſures be united. On this depends our national ſtrength, ſecurity and honor. "Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we ſtand, but divided we fall." Let us then guard againſt that party ſpirit, which has ſo much prevailed in our land, as to tarniſh our glory and injure our happineſs. It is ſaid, that this ſpirit of late has conſiderably abated. If this be a truth, we ought heartily to rejoice, and to exert ourſelves in expelling it wholly from among us. We ought to uſe our utmoſt endeavours to prevent conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and promote concord. To ſtimulate us to the moſt laudable exertions of this kind, let us keep in mind, that nothing can have a greater ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to bring on the diſſolution of our republic and make us the ſport of foreign nations, than di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion among ourſelves. Diviſion is the bane of ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:033813_0025_0FF959043366DBF8"/>
THOSE jarring aims and interfering intereſts, which are produced by it, muſt occaſion ſtops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the wheels of government, embarraſs public meaſures, and greatly annoy the happineſs of a people. "Where ſtrife is there is confuſion and every evil work."</p>
            <p>IF ever our republic is deſtroyed and we loſe our liberties and independence, it muſt be by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided againſt ourſelves. Such is our diſtance from the powerful nations of the world, and ſo great is our national ſtrength, and wealth, that we can be brought to ruin only by that inteſtine ſtrife, which preys upon our vitals and cuts the ſinews of our gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. If then we have any regard to our own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs or true love to our country, let us manifeſt it, by putting an end to our unhappy diviſions and following after the things, which make for peace.</p>
            <p>LET us ceaſe to exaſperate each other with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent words, or the reproachful term of Jacobin or Tory. Let us cultivate brotherly love and ſtrive to be good citizens and true Americans. Let us diſcover our patriotiſm by being well affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our conſtitution, and by encouraging and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the adminiſtrators of our government. Let no ſtrife be known among us, except who ſhall be moſt active and zealous in promoting the honor, ſafety and happineſs of our nation.</p>
            <p>I congratulate my fellow citizens of this State in the choice, which they have made of a chief magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. We rejoice, that we behold at the head of our government, a Gentleman, in whom wiſdom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity

and religion are united, who has had, for many years, the decided voice of his country in his favor, and has rendered eſſential ſervices to the community. Whoſe chriſtian, moral and political character muſt endear him to every enlightened and virtuous mind.</p>
            <p>THE honorable Council, the honorable Senate, and Repreſentatives will accept of that reſpect which is due to their character and important ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>FROM the paſt experience, which we have had a wiſe and faithful adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this State, we now truſt with our civil Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, every thing dear in civil and ſocial life. We flatter ourſelves, they will be miniſters of God for good to this people, and in heart and meaſures u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite to promote the beſt intereſt of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. It is a day of anxious expectation, of trouble and perplexity, but wiſdom is profitable to direct. May this reſpectable body "acknowledge God in all their ways, and may he direct their ſteps."—</p>
            <p>LET us all acknowledge the being and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and be ſubmiſſive to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great diſpoſer of events and the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor of the univerſe. How far the divine Being by his influence interpoſes in the affairs of ſtates &amp; empires is not eaſy to determine. Reaſon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, however, lead us to ſuppoſe, that the riſe, continuance, and fall of empires is under his wiſe and ſupreme direction. The nations of the world, therefore, in their political conduct ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him for direction. They ought to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033813_0027_0FF959209BA4EB68"/>
the principles of piety and virtue that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> may ſecure his favor and obtain his bleſſing.</p>
            <p>ESPECIALLY, the principles of public virtue ought to be exerciſed and improved. National ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence eſſentially depends on this. This has ever been the caſe, in the riſe and advancement, and in the decline and ſubverſion of ſtates and empires. On this a good conſtitution depends. It is this that leads the way to frugality, diligence and oeconomy, obedience to wholeſome laws and regulations, to union, benevolence and peace.</p>
            <p>BUT above all let us attend to the things, that relate to our happineſs beyond the confines of time. Let us cultivate the habits of piety and virtue, that we may become ſubjects of that kingdom of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousneſs and peace, which will ſurvive every change, and continue after all the kingdoms of this world ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the diſſolution of nature.</p>
