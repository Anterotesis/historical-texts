            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE SUFFERINGS OF MARY KINNAN, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHILST the tear of ſenſibility ſo often flows at the unreal tale of woe, which glows un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pen of the poet and the noveliſt, ſhall our hearts refuſe to be melted with ſorrow at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected and unvarniſhed tale of a female, who has ſurmounted difficulties and dangers, which on a review appear romantic, even to herſelf.</p>
            <p>Her hiſtory will not, perhaps, be without its uſe. It will diſplay the ſupporting arm of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence: it will point to the beſt and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſupport under danger and adverſity: and "it will teach the repiner at little evils to be juſter to his God and to himſelf."</p>
            <p>It would be unneceſſary and tedious to deſcribe the firſt part of my life, as it exhibited nothing which is not daily obſerved in the common walks of mankind. Suffice it to ſay, that, bleſt with the affections of the beſt of huſbands, and the love and eſteem of the moſt dutiful of children, my days paſſed ſweetly on, and I had ſcarcely one ſingle wiſh ungratified. Happineſs ſmiled on our cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;—content ſpread her influence around;—the voice of grief was not heard;—and old age crept
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028931_0003_0FDD6FC3D5B119C0"/>
imperceptibly on. Alas! how ſoon was my hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izon obſcured by the dark clouds of misfortune!— how doubly poignant were rendered ſucceeding miſeries by the recollection of ſuch exalted hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs!</p>
            <p>The thirteenth day of May, 1791, will never be effaced from my mind. Although ſince that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable period, four years have almoſt rolled their ample round, ſtill at the recollection, my boſom heaves impetuous; the cold ſweat of fear ſtands on my brow; and the burning tear of anguiſh gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens in my eye. Our houſe was ſituated in a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully romantic and agreeable place, called Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's Valley, in Randolph County, State of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. Here I would mark nature progreſſing, and the revolutions of the ſeaſons; and from theſe would turn to contemplate the buds of virtue and of genius, ſprouting in the boſoms of my children. Employed in ſuch a pleaſing occupation, on that evening, I was ſtartled by the burſting open of the door: I turned my affrighted eyes, and leapt with terror at the ſight of three armed Indians. I ſaw the flaſh of the muſket!—I heard the groan of my huſband! Quick as thought, I ſeized my young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt child: fear added wings to my flight, and I ran with the ſwiftneſs of the wind. Alas! ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had I time to congratulate myſelf on my good fotune, before I was again caught; deſperation gave me ſtrength, and I again broke looſe. I ſcarcely touched the ground as I courſed over the plain, when the cry of my child, ſupplicating me for help, arreſted my ear. The yearnings of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection extinguiſhed my prudence; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting my imbecility, I flew to aſſiſt her, and was taken. A third time I attempted to eſcape, but
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028931_0004_0FDD6FC523A394B8"/>
was knocked to the ground with a tomahawk; I then made ſigns of ſubmiſſion, and was carried to the houſe. Gracious God! what a ſcene preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf to me! My child, ſcalped and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, ſmiled even then; my huſband, ſcalped and weltering in his blood, fixed on me his dying eye, which, though languid, ſtill expreſſed an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion for my ſafety, and ſorrow at his inability to aſſiſt me; and accompanied the look with a groan that went through my heart. Spare me the pain of deſcribing my feelings at this ſcene, this mournful ſcene, which racked my agonizing heart, and precipitated me to the verge of madneſs.</p>
            <p>In happier times, I ſhould have thought that my heart would ceaſe to beat, and my pulſe forget to throb under ſuch an accumulated weight of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. But the ſoul often acquires vigor <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> fortune, and by adverſity is led to the exertion of faculties, which till then were not poſſeſſed, or at leaſt lay dormant. Thus it was with me; I have ſupported <hi>in reality</hi> what, <hi>in idea,</hi> had appeared im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
            <p>After plundering the houſe of the moſt valuable articles, and pinioning my arms behind me, they departed; with them I too was forced to go. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt favorable circumſtances, this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney would have been painful: how much more ſo was it now, when the arrow of calamity was ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling in my boſom; when I was faint through loſs of blood; and without refreſhment, without reſt. Nature too ſeemed to conſpire againſt me: the rain deſcended in torrents; the lightnings flaſhed dreadfully, and almoſt without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; whilſt the thunder rolled awfully on high. We reſted not during the whole of that night,

                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028931_0005_0FDD6FC6B1D01B10"/>

            </p>
            <p>It was on Friday night that I was taken; on Saturday night they reſted, and trimmed their ſcalps. Ah! what did I not feel at the ſight of theſe memorials of ſavage cruelty. I became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to my exiſtence; I was willing to bid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu to that world, whence all the lovely relatives of life were borne before me; and, had I not been reſtrained by the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, I had ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated my exiſtence by my own hand. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, as it were, inſulated to the civilized world —nay, worſe than inſulated, for the poor lonely mariner, who is ſhipwrecked on ſome deſart coaſt, has far greater cauſe to rejoice than I then had.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> next day we continued our march over the more rugged rocks and mountains, wet and ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery with the rain which had ſo lately fallen. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was now ſo far exhauſted, that I could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, except in a very ſlow manner, when, inſtead of compaſſionating my ſufferings, my wearineſs, and misfortunes, I was beaten ſeverely for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming impoſſibilities. About this time they frequently threatened me with death; though I recked not his approach in genuine form, yet, I muſt confeſs, my ſoul ſhrunk from him, when thus cloathed in vengeance, too much for man to bear.</p>
            <p>In this manner we continued our journey, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fatigue ſtill making increaſed ravages on my conſtitution, when one of the Indians was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a ſnake. We were obliged to ſtay nineteen days, before he was cured and able to proceed: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this period I again recovered ſpirits and health ſufficient to follow my ſavage conductors. In this
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028931_0006_0FDD6FCA136C0BC0"/>
accident I beheld and bleſt the good providence of God, thus eminently exerted in reſcuing me from that world, "from whoſe bourn no traveller returns."</p>
            <p>In a few days after this we arrived at the Ohio. Dark and rainy was the night in which we formed a raft, and croſſed the river: dangerous as was the paſſage, we arrived in ſafety at the oppoſite bank; —the period of my misfortunes had not yet arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; many bitter calamities were yet to be felt.</p>
            <p>After this we travelled for two days through the gloomy ridges of pine. Although their extreme wetneſs ſubjected us to many inconveniencies, not to ſay dangers, yet the Indians were fearful of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered, if they made a fire, and, of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, remained without one. From theſe we paſſed into a fine country, where we had plenty of veniſon, and other game; nevertheleſs ſo deeply was I afflicted that I cared not for the food, which was abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve life, and I was compelled by their threats of death, in its moſt horrid form, to eat thoſe victuals for which I had no reliſh.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of June we approached the Shaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anee towns; when we arrived within about half a mile of them they fired their guns, ſtripped the bark from five trees, painted themſelves and me in a moſt horrid manner, and commenced the ſcalp-whoop: never did I hear a ſound ſo calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to inſpire terror: my blood curdled within me at the ſound, and fear took poſſeſſion of all my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. This they repeated five times: they then ſeated themſelves, until a vaſt number of people, attracted by the well-known and pleaſing ſound, came from the town and ſhook hands with them:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028931_0007_0FDD6FCB32EE9EB8"/>
each perſon then ſtruck me with great violence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the head and face, till I could not ſee, and till I finally dropt down ſenſeleſs. They then reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me and aſſiſted me to walk into the town having previouſly explained to me, that all the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe which had been ſo liberally beſtowed upon me, was to welcome me amongſt them.</p>
            <p>During my journey, the ſenſe of preſent danger, blunted the remembrance of paſt miſery, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented me from indulging in gloomy anticipation of future woe;—but now the whole weight of my affliction preſſed heavily on my heart. The picture of my life was deeply, too deeply daſhed with ſhade, and but a few faint ſtrokes of light were intermingled with the numerous touches of the <hi>ſombre</hi> pencil. But when my ſpirits were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ſorrow's dew, I breathed out a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer to heaven, and relied on the benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Father of All. Uniformly my efforts were ſucceſsful, and a calm reſignation diffuſed it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf through my frame, or the rays of hope danced ſweetly round my heart.</p>
            <p>I lived during four days with the ſiſter of the ſavage who tore me from my peaceful home, and often contemplated with a ſigh the depth of degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, of which the human character is capable. On the third of July I was bought by a Delaware ſquaw, and by her was put to the moſt menial and laborious offices.</p>
            <p>One of the principal objects of my attention, whilſt I lived amongſt the Indians, was the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating condition of their women. Here the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſex, inſtead of poliſhing and improving the rough manners of the men, are equally ferocious,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028931_0008_0FDD6FD1526EC3E8"/>
cruel, and obdurate. Inſtead of that benevolent diſpoſition and warm ſenſibility to the ſufferings of others, which marks their characters in more civilized climes, they quaff with extatic pleaſure the blood of the innocent priſoner, writhing with agony under the inhuman torments inflicted upon him—whilſt his convulſive groans ſpeak muſic to their ſouls.</p>
            <p>With my new miſtreſs I continued until the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of St. Clair; then another ſcene was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, which opened afreſh the ſluices of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. The numerous ſcalps of my unfortunate countrymen, which were then exhibited to my view—the rejoicings which took place on that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable occaſion—and the brutal ſcenes which were then tranſacted, ſorely wounded my boſom, already pierced ſo deeply by misfortune's ſhaft.— Still my ſufferings were not alleviated; fed in a very ſcanty manner, I was forced, nevertheleſs, to chop and carry wood to a conſiderable diſtance: in this occupation I had my feet frozen, and this added one more to my already long liſt of woes.</p>
            <p>In the ſpring, for fear of my countrymen, the Indians removed from the Miami towns to Grand Glaize, a moſt beautiful place. Here my ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings became ſtill more aggravated, although they had before appeared at their higheſt poſſible height. A new piece of ground was now to be cleared, and my heart grew more heavy in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as I was ſeparated from my beloved country.</p>
            <p>About this time there were proſpects of peace. Hope, at all times eaſily enkindled, blazed forth at this proſpect, and gilded my ſolitary footſteps: but the year paſſed away, and the devaſtations of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028931_0009_0FDD5EA3C1EA5F28"/>
war ſtill continued. At this time an Indian tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der engaged to convey a letter from me to my friends in New-Jerſey, which he did by my direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this was the firſt news they had heard of me ſince my captivity, and, in the end, was the means of procuring my eſcape.</p>
            <p>The ſucceeding year commiſſioners came from the United States to conclude a treaty; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, however, without attaining their object. The Indians, finding peace was not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, turned out very generally for war, and left me, a prey to all the gloomy horrors of deſpair. In a ſhort time they returned, bringing with them ſome horſes and two priſoners; one of whom, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tuttle, was afterwards redeemed—the other was killed by one of their chiefs.</p>
            <p>In November the Indians began to be weary of war, and, in the beginning of January, ſent in a talk to General Wayne by a Robert Wilſon, an Indian trader, together with three Indians. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Wayne inſiſted, as a preliminary article, that all the priſoners ſhould be delivered up: accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly they came home, and collected a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of us, unfortunate ſufferers, and prepared to ſet out the next day to General Wayne at Fort Jefferſon. But previously to our departure, one of the Britiſh agents came to them, and perſuaded them, that perfidy was a leading trait in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the people of the United States; that they had placed ambuſcades for them; and that they would never return alive. By theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arts, they perſuaded the Indians to perſevere in their warfare, and we were again diſmiſſed to our laborious occupations.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:028931_0010_0FDD6FD16EC52118"/>O Britain! how heavy will be the weight of thy crimes at the laſt great day! Inſtigated by thee, the Indian murderer plunges his knife into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of innocence, of piety, and of virtue; and drags thouſands into a captivity, worſe than death. The cries of widows, and the groans of orphans daily aſcend, like a thick cloud, before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat of heaven, and
<q>
                  <l>"Plead like angels, trumpet-tongued,</l>
                  <l>"For your damnation:</l>
                  <l>"And pity, like a naked, new-born babe,</l>
                  <l>"Striding the blaſt, or heav'n's cherubin, hors'd</l>
                  <l>"Upon the ſightleſs couriers of the air,</l>
                  <l>"Shall blow your horrid deeds in every eye,</l>
                  <l>"That tears ſhall drown the wind."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I had by this time witneſſed ſo many diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, that I yielded myſelf up entirely to deſpondency, and endeavored to ſtifle the few ſcattered rays of hope, which faintly twinkled, like the glimmerings of a lamp juſt ready to expire.— In conſequence of theſe impreſſions, I fell danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ill of a fever, which was accompanied by an exceſſive pain over my whole frame. The Indians now abated, in ſome degree, of the rough treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I had before experienced: but what contributed principally to my recovery was a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I received from my brother, Jacob Lewis, mentioning that he was at Detroit, but that he dared not at preſent come to aſſiſt me becauſe of the antipathy which the Indians evidenced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, on account of his being a native of the United States. To know that I was not immur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the knowledge of my friends and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives; that they ſtill entertained for me a warm, impaſſioned affection, was a delicious cordial to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028931_0011_0FDD6FD2A159E338"/>
my drooping ſpirits. In return to this letter I wrote, that as it would be in the higheſt degree dangerous to come to the place where I then was, I adviſed him ſtill to continue at Detroit, and if it were poſſible by any means to ameliorate my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I made no doubt he would exert himſelf to the utmoſt of his power. For ſix months, we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the pleaſure of each other's correſpondence, being but one hundred and forty miles diſtant, and enjoying a conſtant communication by means of the Indian traders. In the darkeſt and moſt gloomy ſeaſons, his letters inſpired me with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and whilſt I traced in them with joy the ſentiment of friendſhip, and the warmth of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection, I would for a time forget my griefs in the extacy of delight.</p>
            <p>On the firſt day of Auguſt, 1793, we heard of the approach of General Wayne's army. Fearful and perturbed, they immediately ſtarted for the Rapids of the Miami; taking only thoſe things with which they could not diſpenſe, and hiding or burying the reſt. On the tenth I had reſolved to make my eſcape; my plan was thoroughly matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and I waited with impatience the approach of night to put it in execution. But how frail and uncertain are the ſchemes of mankind! how eaſily are even their beſt projects overturned! Going out on that day to get a tent-pole, I accidentally cut my foot in a moſt dangerous manner; this being at the diſtance of eighteen miles from the Rapids and being unable to walk, I was obliged to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thither on a horſe.</p>
            <p>Soon after I arrived I heard from my brother who had joined a party of Britiſh traders, and was coming down to the Rapids that he might ſee
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028931_0012_0FDD6FD735A7AFF0"/>
and perhaps aſſiſt me to eſcape. He ſent a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to me, who behaving in a manner which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Indians, I requeſted him not to come again. He returned, and in a ſhort time my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came himſelf. As he was paſſing through the Indian camp I accidentally ſaw him: my joy was ſo great that I involuntarily gave a ſcream of pleaſure:—the Indian who was with me, ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this ſingular behaviour, viewed me with an inquiſitive eye; I fully comprehended the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his look, and excuſed myſelf in a manner which, I believe, diſſipated his apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>In order to concert ſome means of eſcape, my brother ſent a friend to exchange bread for milk. After performing this errand he opened to me his real buſineſs, and appointed a tree where I might meet my brother that night. According to theſe directions I went, and how great was my ſurprize and diſappointment to find nobody there. But the perſon who had previouſly appointed the tree as a place to meet, explained to me the next day the reaſon why we miſſed of each other, we hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone to different trees. The next night, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Indians having fallen aſleep, I ſtole out about eleven o'clock. I found the brother of my heart anxiouſly expecting my arrival: after thoſe congratulations which might be expected from two ſo dear to each other, who had been ſo long ſeperated, we ſtarted and ran two miles to the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh camp. I then, with a beating, fearful heart, crept into a bruſh-heap, where I lay during all that night, and on the next day my brother came and carried me from the place where I was lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on board a veſſel, which was about to deſcend
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028931_0013_0FDD6FD73B912D10"/>
the Miami river, the captain of which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in my behalf—having previouſly dreſt me in one of his own ſuits of clothes and tied an handkerchief over my eyes, in order, as much as poſſible, to conceal my features. When we came to the mouth of the river, we anchored in full view of the Indians, who had come to the Lake, as well to avoid General Wayne, as to receive their proviſion, which was given them at this place. In this ſituation I remained ſome time, fearful of being recognized and re-claimed by ſome of the Indians: but finally, I prevailed with the maſter of a batteau, who was going to Turtle Iſland in Lake Erie, to carry me thither with him. When we arrived there we went on board a ſhip which was then lying at anchor there, bearing twelve guns, and were ſtrictly examined by a Commodore Grant, who, when informed of my ſufferings, uſed his intereſt to have me taken on board a brig going to Detroit. Having arrived at this laſt-mentioned place, I was ſo overcome by the joy which I felt at my delivery and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue which attended it, that I continued unwell and unable to proceed for eight days. At the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration of this period, I croſſed Lake Erie and came to Niagara, where I was again examined, and having produced the paſs given us by Commodore Grant, obtained another from Simcoe to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States. We deſcended in a batteau to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſee river, and thence travelled to New-Jerſey, where I arrived amongſt my friends on the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day of October, 1794.</p>
            <p>If my hiſtory has been marked with woe-worn incidents;—if I have been in a peculiar manner the child of misfortune;—if my cup of life has
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028931_0014_0FDD6FD8AFB0B5B0"/>
been deeply mixed with gall;—if deſpair has brooded over my ſoul, with all its horrors;—and finally, if I have been obliged to diſmiſs even dear deluſive hope, having ſo often felt "what kind of ſickneſs of the heart that was, which proceeds from hope deferred:"—yet, by theſe very woes, I have been led to place my dependence on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent diſpenſer of good and evil, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my affections from that world, where the ties by which mankind are in general ſo firmly bound are indiſſolubly broken. Since the conſequences of my affliction have been ſo beneficial, I repine not at it; ye, who are pierced by the darts of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, imitate my example, and like me recline on the boſom of your Father and your God.</p>
