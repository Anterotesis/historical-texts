            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <q>I. COR. II. 4. <hi>And my speech, and my preaching was not with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing words of man's wisdom: but in demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, and of power.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AMONG human characters we ſhall find but very few, who make nearer approaches to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Lord, than the writer of this epiſtle. Soon after it pleaſed the GOD of all grace to reveal his Son in him, we find he was <hi>caught up to the third Heavens</hi> and there, he tells us <hi>he heard words which were unspeakable and unlawful for man to utter.</hi> From other hints in his hiſtory, it appears, that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, revelations, and a prophetic ſpirit were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with him, and through the whole of his life after his converſion, he poſſeſſed an uncommon ſhare of that grace which is common to all chriſtians, and in no accompliſhment did he come ſhort of the very chiefeſt apoſtle.—Thus educated by communion with GOD in divine things, and the Holy Spirit giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing energy to his natural gifts, it is not ſurpriſing we ſhould find that ſeraphic zeal, fervent affection, and ſaperior exertion, which were ſo diſtinguiſhed in the life of this apoſtle, and advanced him ſo near the ſtandard of perfection, the example of Chriſt.—Well may we therefore pay great attention to the conduct of this illuſtrious character, that we may copy his manner both in ſpirit and exertion, and follow him wherein he followed Chriſt.—But in no caſe is his example more worthy the imitation of all who are walled to a ſimilar employment, than his manner of communicating the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>.—Of this he
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033960_0003_0FF9BEBB6FF54C48"/>has given us a hint in the text.—After ſuggeſting to his brethren the manner of his coming among them, which was not with excellency of ſpeech, or wiſdom declaring unto them the teſtimony of GOD, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to know nothing among them, ſave Jeſs Chriſt and him crucified, and was with them in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fear, and much trembling: He added as in the text—"And my ſpeech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wiſdom: but in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power."—</p>
            <p>This manner at firſt view, muſt ſtrike our minds as highly excellent, and worthy of imitation, as it leaves out in general, whatever is unſuitable to ſo important a work as preaching the goſpel, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes whatever may give weight, and force to the pure precepts of truth.—It ſhall be our buſineſs therefore on the preſent occaſion to illuſtrate three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The manner which the apoſtle diſowned as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming any part of his preaching (viz.) "Enticing words of man's wiſdom."</p>
            <p n="2">II. The manner which he claimed as his own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, expreſſed in the words "In demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power." And</p>
            <p n="3">III. Why he preſerred this latter mode.</p>
            <p>After attending to theſe propoſals ſeverally, ſhall cloſe with a few motives to an imitation of ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy an example.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is propoſed to illuſtrate the manner which the apoſhle diſowned as forming any part of his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (viz) enticing words of man's wiſdom — Said he "<hi>My speech and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033960_0004_0FF9D8E9D4A9D350"/>Rome, Athens, and Corinth called ſophiſts—they were renowned for their ſubtilty in reaſoning, and drawing off the mind from any maxims, in which it had been eſtabliſhed. They ſucceeded by an artful, inſinuating addreſs, and fallacious appearance of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. This manner after the ſpread of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, was found no leſs alluring to the people at large, than ſubſervient to the carnal, ſelfith ends of falſe teachers. They adopted it as beſt calculated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their private intereſt, reputation, or eaſe. In preaching what they wiſhed to palm upon the world as goſpel, they mingled <hi>this science falsely so called,</hi> and by enticing words of their own wiſdom drew off the minds of their hearers from the truth, as it is in Jeſus, and fixed them on other objects.—Said the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle "They that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but their own belly and by good words, and fair ſpeeches, deceive the hearts of the ſimple." —This manner ever ſince the apoſtle's time has been practiſed by ſuch, as through ignorance or raſhneſs, have obtruded themſelves into the miniſtry, <hi>without ever being called of</hi> GOD, <hi>or even knowing in the leaſt degree the power of Godliness upon their hearts.</hi> To convey the moſt clear idea of this manner, it may be neceſſary to adduce a few caſes in which it is moſt commonly diſplayed.—and</p>
            <p>1ſt. When the internal views of the preacher are to advance his own private intereſt, then his words are prone to be enticing, leaſt he ſhould offend ſuch, as are unſanctified among his opulent and influential friends and hereby endanger his worldly circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Whatever <hi>oſtensible motives natural men may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit</hi> as their inducements to preach the goſpel, yet, the <hi>real ones</hi> which actuate their hearts and govern their conduct are <hi>strictly selfish</hi>: and their ſelfiſhneſs and carnal wiſdom, <hi>will bear sway,</hi> and form the moſt <hi>prominent features</hi> in their manner of preaching. In this caſe therefore the preacher's own feelings and wiſdom <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him to "prophecy ſmooth things."
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033960_0005_0FF9D8EFC7BBC450"/>To preach merely ſuch moral duties as all men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove —which admit of no diſpute—are good for ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſociety, and tend to promote good order. This is a pleaſing alluring manner. He is very ſenſible, that the diſtinguiſhing doctrines of the goſpel, deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered pointedly and preſſed according to their infinite importance give great uneaſineſs to the conſciences of the wicked: hence in general, he conſiders it, the moſt <hi>prudent way,</hi> either to paſs over them <hi>wholly,</hi> or deſcribe them <hi>so faintly,</hi> that few or none will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his meaning—This manner is enticing, as it diverts the minds of men from the eſſentials of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and amuſes them with <hi>such doings,</hi> as are wholly deceitful conſidered as a title to Heaven.— It is enticing as it implies that thoſe moral virtues taught by heathen moraliſts anſwer men's duty to GOD, and receive this ſanction from his word.—It is enticing alſo, as thoſe virtues ſuit preciſely <hi>the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved selfish feelings</hi> of all natural men: are heard with pleaſure by moral hypocrites and tend directly to ſettle them more and more upon their lees, and confirm them in the habits of ſelf-righteouſneſs— Their conſciences grow more ſeared; they feel whole, and are "alive without the law."—Preachers who are thus calculating to ſerve themſelves, and by <hi>good words and fair speeches,</hi> keep in perfect peace with their ungodly pariſhioners, treat the cardinal doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of the goſpel as dangerous. Their maxims of carnal policy are <hi>Suit the times, Piease the people,</hi> and keep the <hi>Peace inviolably.</hi>—They really feel, that to preach the law of GOD in its nature and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to deſine the nature of holineſs, and ſin, and exhibit them <hi>plainly without disguise,</hi> and their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſequences, would certainly give offence— cenſure would enſue—imprudence be charged upon them, and they ſhould ſuffer by it.—They <hi>really feel</hi> that ſhould they exhibit plainly without diſguiſe the ſovereignty of GOD, the total depravity of the human heart, regeneration, adoption, and ſanctification, and the neceſſity of an holy life, and preſs them pointed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033960_0006_0FF9BEC3DCF24358"/>ly, it would plant arrows of conviction, or excite uneaſineſs and diſguſt in the minds of their hearers. Their carnal wiſdom therefore teaches them, it would be <hi>shockingly in prudent</hi> to hazard ſuch prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Hence, when any of theſe docrrines come in their way, they laviſh their enticing words, to rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er them obſeure, unintelligible or doubtful.—Their ſyſtem of carnal prudence forbids that they ſhould expreſs them pointedly, and dwell upon them plainly. But when their diſcourſe, or the complaints of the pious compel them to ſay ſomething about them, they will do it by way of diſtant alluſions: and be careful to expreſs the doctrine in view ſo ſaintly, that the moſt critical can but juſt diſcern their meaning, and the feebler mind is wholly bewildered and loſt. Words of doubtful ſignifications, long circumlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſubtle ſuggeſtions are introduced to ſheathe ſuch points of goſpel truth, as are moſt likely to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate and rouſe the conſciences of the wicked. In ſtead of awakening and rouſing the ſupine ſinner, their buſineſs is to keep him ſecure, and flatter him that his moral virtues are pleaſing and acceptable to GOD.—Such preachers deem it imprudent to let the plain truths of the goſpel, beam upon men's conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their full ſtrength.—They think that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of GOD—the total depravity of the human heart —regeneration by the Holy Ghoſt—and eternal pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment are ſuch <hi>swords of the Spirit,</hi> that they will <hi>do hurt,</hi> if they are not kept ſafely lodged in thick ſcabbards of enticing words.—They never can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to be explicit on theſe points, or act in any degree as if they <hi>really believed</hi> them: But they will talk around about them with much plauſibility —keep their own opinions out of ſight, by telling thoſe of other men, and looſe their hearers in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of general obſervations.</p>
            <p>Others again, whoſe ultimate end in preaching is to enjoy life, free from the tumults of other occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are ever enticing in their manner. A deep ſenſe of their perſonal eaſe fills them with the utmoſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033960_0007_0FF9D8FBAF155840"/>averſion to ſpeaking plain on any ſubject. They combat no falſe doctrines—they keep clear of diſputes —their charity has no limits—they reprove no ſin or ſinners ſo as to be underſtood—they ſpeak againſt foreign vices, ſuch as their hearers have no concern in—<hi>discipime</hi> they ſhun like a peſtilence—and facri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice every <hi>spiritual interest</hi> to <hi>keeping the peace.</hi> Their fear of man, ariſing from a fear of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed, utterly forbids a pointed word or animated ſentence—their lukewarm morality ſerves but as an opiate to conſcience, and to lull into ſecurity every natural feeling of the human heart. Their carnal wiſdom powerfully impreſſes it upon them, that in order to do good, <hi>Mankind must be taken as they are, and allured to courses of virtue, without disturbing their propensities to vice.</hi>

               </note>. Little conſidering that the very nature of the caſe renders ſuch a proceeding ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely impoſſible. So long as the heart of every natural man is enmity againſt GOD, it is at war with every truth of GOD rightly underſtood. How can ſuch truths therefore allure? No, ſuch preachers are obliged to entice, and allure by preaching ſome oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er goſpel, in order to practice upon their own plan. And hence they ſerve not our I ord Jeſus Chriſt but their own intereſt, and are a dead weight on his cauſe. As a reaſon for this impious moral inoriguing, they inſinuate that the people cannot bear undiſguiſed plainneſs—they will turn inſane—raiſe perſecution— embroil ſociety in endleſs diſputes and parties—and in ſhort, the light in the candleſtick muſt be removed or extinguiſhed—I be moſt eagle eyed prudence therefore muſt guard againſt ſuch calamities, and not endanger their worldly comforts or the public peace by preaching the diſtinguiſhing doctrines of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>2dly. This manner is alſo adopted when the views of the preacher centre in the acquiſition of fame.

            <p>A proſution of learned criticiſm on familiar ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects tends to obſcure and weaken their force on the mind.

            </p>
            <p>To exhibit this manner, in all its propriety, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and force, would need the apoſtle himſelf to ſtand before you. Indeed, to enter into a compaſs of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which ſeem neceſſary to it, and promiſe juitice to their illuſtration, would be too much for any man. What is to follow, will conſiſt merely in preſenting to view a few things implied in exhib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iting the truths of the goſpel, in the manner hinted by our apoſtle.—</p>
            <p>The holy ſpirit of GOD by whom all divine truths have been revealed, is in his nature abſorately <hi>ſimple,</hi> uncompounded of any thing not eſſential to him. He is <hi>pure,</hi> infinitely removed from all ſin or error —<hi>plain,</hi> unobſcured by diſguiſe, artifice, or deceit— <hi>searching,</hi> pervading all things—<hi>exalted,</hi> infinitely above the wiſdom or correction of creatures—<hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> in parſaing the glory of GOD, and the beſt good of his kingdom—and <hi>power ful,</hi> in all his operations. This holy ſpirit has left the image of theſe perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, as well as many others, on the law and goſpel of GOD, which he has revealed. To preach the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel therefore, ſo as that the ſpirit of GOD ſhould be <hi>seen, manifested and proved,</hi> is to preach it <hi>ſimply,</hi> in its true nature, uncompounded of any thing contrary to it—to preach it <hi>purely,</hi> free from corroption or error—<hi>plainly,</hi> ſo that every mind may apprehend it —<hi>searchingly,</hi> ſo as to reach the heart and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience —<hi>boldly,</hi> above the ſear or correction of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wiſdom—<hi>ardently,</hi> feeling its excellence and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance —and <hi>efficaciously,</hi> being attended with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence in rene wing men's ſouls.</p>
            <p>To preach the goſpel in this manner is to preach it, <hi>in demonstration of the spirit and of power.</hi> That
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033960_0012_0FF9D920CE57C4A8"/>this was the manner claimed by the apoſtle as his practice will appear from hints and examples left on ſacred record, of the particulars juſt mentioned.—and</p>
            <p>1ſt. He preached the truths of the goſpel ſimply, unmixed with ary thing contrary to them. Said he to his chriſtian friends at Galatia "I certify you brethren that the goſpel which was preached of me, is not after man, for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt." The goſpel which the apoſtle preached he affirms was <hi>not after man,</hi> that is, according to man's depraved nature, wiſdom, and feelings: but it was holy like the law of GOD, to which the natural hearts of men are not ſabject. This goſpel he did not receive from man, but from the teaching of Chriſt's ſpirit.—In preaching it therefore he deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its doctrines in their ſimplicity as impreſſed upon his mind by the Holy Ghoſt—He exhibited Chriſt's character as divine, his offices, his atonement, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and aſienſion, and the whole counſel of GOD in their ſimplicity, unmixed with human inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And hereby demonſtrated the very ſpirit, whoſe image theſe doctrines bear.—Through the whole of divine revelation, this ſimplicity is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted; which is a kind of divine impreſſure. deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>the truth, dignity, and property of the Deity</hi>— This impr<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> from error attended his ſimplicity of docrine.—No perſon conld be more guarded againſt every ſpecles of falſe religion. "I marvel;" ſaid he likewiſe to his Galatian brethren; "that ye are ſo ſoon <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> from him that called you into the goſpel of Chriſt, unte another goſpel, which is not another, but there be ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the goſpel of Chriſt.—But <hi>though we,</hi> or an angel from Heaven, preach any other goſpel, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

For if I yet pleaſe men I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt." Penetrated with the importance of preſerving the goſpel pure from all poſſible error or corruption, he abhorred the idea of the brethren's admitting the leaſt deviation from the truths they had already received, on any pretence whatever. Although the apoſtles themſelves, or an angel from beaven, or any man ſhould pretend they had ſome new diſcoveries better, or more worthy their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were to <hi>let them all be accursed.</hi> But ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſcious of his own integrity he aſks "Do I ſeek to pleaſe men, that is, "is it my manner as ſome would inſinuate to ingraciate myſelf into the good opinions of carnal men, by altering the doctrines of the goſpel ſo as to pleaſe their <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved humors and feelings?</hi> Let all men judge of my couduct. So far from this, <hi>I affirm if I yet please men, if my preaching pleases the depraved feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of mankind I am not the servant of Christ.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of perſuading GOD, or endeavoring to reduce his truth to men's wiſhes; which is a ſhocking idea; my whole buſineſs is to perſuade men to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to GOD." He could hardly ſpeak with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient deteſtation of the idea that he endeavored to pleaſe men in their ſins—he was perfectly ſenſible, he could not be the ſervant of Chriſt, any further than he exhibited his trath, unadulterated with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man additions. The pority of the traths he deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore demonſtrated the Spirit by whom they were dictated.</p>
            <p>3dly. Plainneſs alſo diſtinguiſhed the manner of our apoſtle. Said he "I brethren when I came to you, came not with excellency of ſpeech or of man's wiſdom declaring unto you the teſtimony of GOD, for I determined not to know any thing among you, ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him erneiſied." His words, utterance, and actions, were only <hi>the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of the truths he delivered.</hi> Every mind <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the very <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:033960_0014_0FF9BED4493E2E30"/>he deſcribed: Being oceupied and affected with theſe, they thought nothing of the ſpeaker. The moſt perfect ſimplicity of ſtile ran through all his delineations of goſpel doctrines. When it is ſaid by a brother apoſtle "that there were ſome things in his epiſtles, hard to be underſtood which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and unſtable wreſt to their own deſtruction." It is not to be underſtood, that thoſe things were rendered hard by the obſcurity, ſubtility, or diſguiſe, in which he delivered them, but they were hard through the ſublimity of the ſubjects upon which he treated. When he publiſhed the goſpel abroad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the gentiles, or edified his brethren in ſettled churches, he dared not to preach in that flowery, brilliant ſtile, adopted by falſe teachers, or the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſt of his day, whoſe object was to <hi>display them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> He dared not diſguiſe and blur the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of GOD, by ſhewing his ſkill in oratory, or fine compoſition, or making himſelf admired for his gifts —He feared to diſguiſe goſpel doctrines by enticing words of man's wiſdom: he knew that his own ſoul muſt pay for ſuch perfidy. Said he, "As we were allowed of GOD, to be put in truſt with the goſpel, <hi>even so we speak,</hi> not as <hi>pleasing men but</hi> GOD, who trieth our hearts; for neither at any time uſed we flattering words, as ye know—nor a cloke of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toaſneſs GOD is witneſs—Nor of men ſought we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, neither of you, nor yet of others." It never was apparent that ſometimes his words were ſhaped to pleaſe the carnal taſtes of his hearers, as a cloke of covetouſneſs to gain their worldly intereſt; and at another to command their applanſe. His very ſoul <hi>detested that downy preaching which sews pillows to all armholes, and barters Heaven, the blood of Christ, the souls of men and the glory of God,</hi> for the empty puffs of human approbation. On the other hand, he loved the truth—he loved his GOD and Savior—he loved the ſouls of men, and dealt out the bread of life, in the plaineſt manner, and "long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for all his hearers in the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt."
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033960_0015_0FF9D94332ED1048"/>He determined to know nothing among any people, but <hi>Christ Jesus and him crucified.</hi> In illultrating Chriſt's perſon, offices, and crucifixion, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely weighty truths connected with them, he had no uſe for excellency of ſpeech or carnal wiſdom. Theſe were utterly unſuitable here. Simplicity, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, and ardor, were the only ornaments admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Said he "We have received not the ſpirit of this world, but the ſpirit which is of GOD, that we might know the things which are freely given to us of GOD—which things alſo, we ſpeak not in the words <hi>which man's wisdom teacheth,</hi> but which the <hi>Holy Ghost teacheth,</hi> comparing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual"—He had not received the ſpirit of this world, but the ſpirit which is of GOD, and his very words in which he expreſſed the truths of the goſpel were dictated to him by the Holy Ghoſt. Man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved wiſdom had no predominant ſway over him, but his <hi>plainness</hi> was in <hi>demonstration of the Spirit of</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>4thly. This plainneſs gave him opportunity to approach the conſciences of men.—It is ſaid of all the apoſtles "That they poſſeſſed a power, almoſt irreſiſtable, <hi>to send truth and conviclion into the heart.</hi>" The pointedneſs and power, with which they often ſpake, proved that their aſſiſtance was divine—When our apoſtle "Reaſoned before Felix, of righteouſneſs, temperance, and judgment to come" and directed theſe ſolemn truths to his conſcience, How, <hi>he trembled!</hi> Did he not ſce himſelf tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the bar of GOD, arraigned, convicted, and condemned? Did he not plainly ſee the juſtice of GOD's eternal wrath againſt ſuch ſinners? No doubt —How then <hi>could he but tremble!</hi> This pointed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of addreſs and application of the weighty truths of GOD's word to his conſcience penetrated his <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened soul,</hi> and <hi>compelled him to feel.</hi>—Before King Agrippa likewiſe the apoſtle had opportunity to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

I know that thou believeſt"— To which he replied—" Paul, almoſt thou <hi>persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest me</hi> to be a chriſtian" How powerful was this pointed addreſs?—To a large body of Jews, and Fathers of the nation at Rome, the apoſtle expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and teſtified the kingdom of GOD, perfuading them concerning Jeſus, both out of the law of Moſes, and out of the Prophets from <hi>morning tili evening.</hi> And when they were not agreed among themſlves, and about to depart he addreſſed them and ſaid "Well ſpake the Holy Ghoſt by Eſaias the Prophet unto our fathers ſaying, Go unto this people, and ſay, hearing ye ſhall hear, and ſhall not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee, and not perceive: for the heart of this peopie is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they cloſed, leaſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them. <hi>Be it known therefore unto you, that the Salvation of God, is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</hi> When he had ſaid theſe words, the Jews departed and had <hi>great reasonings among themselves.</hi>" Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are numerous in which his pointed addreſſes to mens hearts are illuſtrated, and the mighty effects which followed. Inſtead of endeavoring to hide the truths of the goſpel and make them ſit eaſy upon the conſciences of the wicked, like falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it was his chief deſign, to exhibit them in their <hi>native brightness,</hi> and direct them with all their force to the hearts of his auditory, and diſturb with cutting conviction the moſt ſtupid ſinner. He had no idea that divine truth was dangerous—Inſtead of being <hi>afraid</hi> that mankind ſhould <hi>see</hi> their <hi>awful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and become troubleſome, he endeavored with <hi>all his powers</hi> to let them ſee and feel their <hi>ruin and danger</hi>—He knew that the "word of the Lord was quick and powerful, ſharper than any two edged ſword piercing even to the dividing aſunder of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033960_0017_0FF9D95A4EA43EC8"/>the ſoul and ſpirit: and of the joints and marrow, <hi>and a discerner of the thoughts and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ents of the heart</hi> —He was taught this by the Holy Ghoſt: and his deſign was if poſſible, to let this word of GOD, have its <hi>full force</hi> upon the hearts of his hearers, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their ſituations. He was not afraid of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. His ſelfiſhneſs, was <hi>extinguiſhed</hi> in his love for Chriſt and the ſouls of men. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he dared to give the truths of the goſpel their <hi>point, and their edge,</hi> and preſs the conſciences of men with all his <hi>skill and strength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5thly. His boldneſs, and undaunted reſolution in preaching the goſpel likewiſe marked his manner. —Before Kings, Governors, and chief Captains, Jewiſh courts, and every inſtrument of perſecution and torture, he ſpoke with freedom and energy. When arraigned before Nero the Roman Emperor; that monſter of ſavage barbarity; Said the apoſtle "At my firſt anſwer, no man ſtood with me: but all men forſook me; I pray God, that it might not be laid to their charge. Notwithſtanding the Lord ſtood with me, and ſtrengthened me, that by me <hi>the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles might hear</hi>: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion." While even friends forſook him through fear; and ſurrounded with enemies who thirſted for his blood; and wholly uncertain how his trial would turn, either in life or death—<hi>even here,</hi> ſtrengthened by his Lord, he let the preaching of the goſpel be <hi>fully known, so that all the Gentiles might hear.</hi> Borne up with a ſenſe of duty to his great Lord, and Maſter, in the diſcharge of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the gentiles, <hi>he feared not the face of man</hi>: nor ſuffered his feelings or utterance to be daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the proſpect of death, in all its horrors.—Like the Holy Spirit, by whom he was inſpired, he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed a magnanimity of ſoul, an holy elevation, infinitely above the vengeance of a world— This elevation was conſpicuous not only in his preaching, and ſcenes of danger in every place, but
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033960_0018_0FF9BEE6BA8794E0"/>
               <hi>it pervades</hi> all his writings in the facred volume. It could not be told by his ſtile or manuer, that he ever ſuſpected there were ſuch a race of beings as <hi>critics,</hi> or that the truths he delivered were liable to injury or abuſe. <hi>The dignity of the word of God and its importance filled his soul, and he thought of nothing else</hi>—But,</p>
            <p>6thly. The ardor with which he purſued the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his miniſtry further illuſtrates his manner. His heart being filled with love to Chriſt, the ſouls of men, and the glory of GOD, he preached, agoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſuffered in the fervor of this love, and let no worldly concerns divert him from the objects of it. Said he "What things were gain to me once, theſe I count loſs for Chriſt—yea, doubtleſs, I count all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt." The loſs of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral goods, worldly honor, and eaſe, were not worth mentioning when put in competition with Chriſt. He counted them all <hi>but dross and dirt.</hi> This ſingleneſs of affection for his Lord, made him preach with the <hi>ardor</hi> of a ſeraph. To dwell upon the glories of Chriſt's divinity, his offices, and atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their bleſſed conſequences in the ſalvation of <hi>lost men who repent,</hi> was the richeſt feaſt of his ſoul. On the other hand, he agonized, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lengthened out his ſpeech till break of day, in perſuading miſerable ſinners to be reconciled to God. Said he to the Elders of Epheſus "Ye know from the firſt day I came into Aſia, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I have been with you at all ſeaſons. Serving the Lord with all humility, and with many tears and temptations which befel me; and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, and have taught you publicly and from houſe to houſe, teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to the Jews and alſo to the Greeks, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and remember, that by the ſpace of <hi>three
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033960_0019_0FF9D9846939CD70"/>years</hi> I ceaſed not to <hi>warn every one, night and day with tears.</hi> This ſhewed the <hi>ardor</hi> with which he <hi>perſuaded and entreated</hi> periſhing ſouls to come to Chriſt. And "Now, ſays he, I go bound in the Spirit to Jeruſalem, not knowing the things which ſhall befall me there, ſave that the Holy Ghoſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth in every city, that bonus, and aſſlictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the miniſtry, which I have received of the Lord Jeſus to teſtify the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the grace of GOD." After rehearſing the manner in which he had labored among them, his ſoul anticipated the trials he was about to endure at Jeruſalem. But no ſooner are they mentioned, than his <hi>ztal and fortitude burst forth</hi> in an holy tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, <hi>but none of these things move me!</hi> like the rock in the midſt of the ocean, againſt which the billows <hi>beat and daſh,</hi> but cannot <hi>move.</hi> And when his brethren at Ceſaria would diſſuade him from his purpoſe of going to Jeruſalem he replied, "What meanye, to weep and break mine heart? For I am ready not to be <hi>bound only,</hi> but alſo to <hi>die</hi> at Jeruſalem for the name of Jeſus."—Theſe inſtances in which the warmth of his heart led him to expreſs the truths of the goſpel, and purſue the glory of his Lord in building up his cauſe, <hi>ar above comment.</hi> His very <hi>soul glowed</hi> with that ſpirit of truth and love, which he demonſtrated in every diſcourſe, and be purſued his object till he laid down his life in the cauſe.—</p>
            <p>Finally. His manner of preaching in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit was alſo attended with the <hi>power</hi> of GOD in renewing men's ſouls and preparing them ſor Heaven. Said he, to his Corinthian brethren "Though you have ten thouſand inſtructors in Chriſt, yet have ye not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fathers, for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the goſpel." And again "Ye are manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to be the epiſtle of Chriſt miniſtered by us—written not with ink, but with the Sprit of the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033960_0020_0FF9BEEE30D23EC8"/>living GOD—not in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the heart." The power of the Holy Ghoſt accompanied the truths preached, and cauſed them to ſpring forth in an harveſt of ſouls.—GOD was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſignally to own and bleſs the apoſtle's miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of divine truth for the <hi>great end</hi> of preaching, and hereby he <hi>demonstrated the power</hi> of the holy Spirit in the actual ſalvation of multitudes. This manner in all its branches, the apoſtle claimed as his <hi>own practice,</hi> in diſtinction from that of falſe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. <hi>Said he,</hi> "my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit and of power."—It was propoſed in the</p>
            <p n="3">III. Place to ſhew why the apoſtle preferred this latter mode. The reaſon given to the brethren in the context is, "That their faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men but in the power of God."—That is, he preached the goſpel <hi>simply, purely, plainly, pointedly, boldly, and ardently,</hi> that their faith in Chriſt, might not reſt, in the reaſonings and perſuaſions of <hi>carnal wisdom,</hi> but ſhould be the effect of the power of GOD, <hi>attending</hi> a manifeſtation of his truth. A faith which has its origin <hi>here</hi> is genuine. It will always be ſtrengthened by the pure doctrines of chriſtianity—will work by love —overcome the world—<hi>and life, till heaven opens on the soul.</hi> But <hi>every faith</hi> which ſtands in the wiſdom of men, or is grounded in <hi>human persuasion,</hi> will <hi>die</hi> like the meteor, which flaſhes but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. —It only remains that the above example, be recommended to our imitation by the following mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. —And</p>
            <p>1ſt. The motive which the apoſtle himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as influential on him, muſt be ſtriking, and coerſive on <hi>all</hi> who are engaged in a ſimilar em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Why is the goſpel publiſhed <hi>at all,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it is to be heard; ſo that mankind may be impreſſed by it, and believe it to their ſalvation? But if this is the deſign of its publication, then it
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033960_0021_0FF9D9A735EDE880"/>is plainly the duty of every one to whom it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to publiſh it <hi>in demonstration of the spirit and of power.</hi> Men's faith cannot ſtand in the power of GOD, unleſs this power produce it. And the apoſtle intimated we have no right to expect this power to attend where the ſpirit of truth is not exhibited. Conſequently unleſs thoſe who pretend to preach the goſpel, do it after the manner of the apoſtle, they may as well ceaſe from their labors. For the very deſign of their preaching is defeated.—Unleſs that particular mode be adopted which GOD has enjoined, and which he will own and ſucceed by affording the operations of his holy Spirit, it is in vain to attempt to preach: nay, for perſons deſignedly to deviate from this manner, through the influence of their own <hi>carnal wisdom,</hi> thinking that they are competent to make <hi>improvements upon</hi> GOD'S <hi>plan,</hi> is <hi>horred trifling with sacred things</hi>; and deſtructive to the higheſt intereſts of men's ſouls. How powerful therefore is this motive to enforce an imitation of the apoſtle.</p>
            <p>2d. The example of Chriſt is a motive to it. Did not our Lord himſelf ſet the patern before the apoſtle? "Never man ſpake like" him. How per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly he underſtood his Fathers will? In him was "Hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge." He poſſeſſed the Holy Spirit without meaſure. His words were <hi>spirit and life.</hi> How ſimply and purely did he communicate the truth—how plainly to the reception of every mind—how pointedly and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to the heart? He never miſſed his deſign. He ever knew the ſecret receſſes of the ſoul, and when he directed a ſentence to the conſcience, it was irreſiſtable. The Scribes and Phariſces, the young moraliſt and every hypocrite, were witneſſes of this. How he agonized in preaching and prayer for his ſheep—how <hi>undaunted</hi> all his conduct zeal and love for his father's glory filled his heart. The power of the Holy Ghoſt ever attended his word, and all whom the Father had given him he
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033960_0022_0FF9D9B8917F37B0"/>irreſiſtably drew. How infinitely forcible is this example to ſtimulate all his Ambaſſadors to an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it. The apoſtle Paul felt its impulſe in every faculty, and <hi>his sensibility</hi> was but the <hi>duty</hi> of every ſervant of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>3dly. The rules of GOD'S word, enjoin this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. "Go preach the preaching I bid thee." How can the diſciple deviate from this command, <hi>in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or manner?</hi> "What I tell you in darkneſs, that ſpeak ye in light, and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the houſe tops, And fear not them that kill the body"—Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long ſuffering and doctrine—"Make full proof of thy miniſtry—give thyſelf wholly to theſe things —Take heed unto thyſelf, and unto thy doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this, thou ſhalt ſave thyſelf and them that hear thee." It is impoſſible to be a miniſter of Chriſt without putting theſe rules in practice in ſome good degree. And this is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our apoſtle wherein he followed Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4thly. To imitate his example is the only method which is ſuitable to the great doctrines of the goſpel— ſuch as the character and offices of the adorable Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty —the laws of GOD—the death of Chriſt—his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and aſcenſion—the loſt ſtate of man—eternal happineſs and interminable miſery. It is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for preachers who pretend to believe theſe doctrines, and would keep up any counſiſtancy between their belief and practice, that they follow the apoſtle and preach theſe doctrines, as he did, according to their giſts, <hi>in demonstration of the spirit and of power.</hi> Miniſters of the goſpel are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in ſome ſenſe to ſland in the light, "even as GOD is in the light." They ſtand in the preſence of GOD, and of Chriſt <hi>always,</hi> and in the preſence of his word. Their faces ought to ſhine, as the face of Moſes when he deſcended from the mount; and expreſs in all their converſation the unction of the Holy Spirit. And as they are called likewiſe to
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033960_0023_0FF9D9CA295275F0"/>lay open to their fellow ſinners the moſt ſolemn—the moſt awful, and joyful truths reſpecting the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous and wicked, through eternity: How eſſential is it to conſiſtency that they ſhould do <hi>this,</hi> in the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and demonſtration of GOD's Spirit? Preachers who can paſs over theſe ſolemn ſubjects, and amuſe their hearers with cold conciſe ſpeculations on mere morality—who can trifte with the doctrines of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation —preach with enticing words of man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom —live on the houors which come from men, <hi>and cry peace peace to the wicked,</hi> give the lie to their bible. There is ſuch an utter inconſiſtency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſuch a method of preaching and a realizing belief of the ſcriptures, that every awakened con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience proclaims, that they are unbelievers. Their profeſſions of belief, and deceitful handling of divine things only render their <hi>hypocricy</hi> more <hi>hateful</hi> in the ſight of GOD and men. Such preachers under all their pretended <hi>humanity, and tenderness</hi> for men's feelings, <hi>when viewed in the light of eternity, appear</hi> more cruel than the tyger, and as deſtitute of goſpel tenderneſs as the old ſerpent who deceives them. <note n="§" place="bottom">

How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite are the motives which ſtand before us, and urge to this duty?—This ſubject therefore naturally addreſſes itſelf to thoſe preſent to whom GOD has committed in charge the preaching of his word.—</p>
            <p>It calls up our attention <hi>Rev. Fathers and Brethren</hi> to the manner in which we fulfill our miniſtry.— Which of the modes deſcribed by the apoſtle do we practice? Are we ſecretly moved in our preaching by an <hi>ultimate view</hi> to our temporal intereſt, honor, or eaſe? Do we conſider it of ſupreme importance to be <hi>so prudent,</hi> or ſo carnally wiſe, <hi>as not to disturb unbelievers?</hi> eſpecially our <hi>opulent, unsanctified hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?</hi> If we ſpeak what our conſciences dictate as truth, yet, do we not deſignedly ſpeak it in ſuch a <hi>guarded way,</hi> that its edge ſhall not be ſelt by <hi>those
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033960_0025_0FF9D9ECF0B75428"/>who love it not?</hi> Said our Lord "<hi>The world cannot receive the spirit of truth</hi>: they hate the light neither come they to the light." Yet, do we not deſignedly expreſs the truth ſo <hi>coolly, cautiously or obscurely,</hi> that the world ſhall receive it and <hi>shall not hate the light?</hi> Such attempts no donbt are performed with enticing words of man's wiſdom. Such a mode is in fact, to <hi>adulterate the truth so much</hi> as that a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt taste</hi> is not diſguſted with it. Further, do we not endeavor to eſcape cenſure by preaching in ſuch <hi>general,</hi> or <hi>equivocal terms,</hi> as may ſuit <hi>all kinds of religious sentiments?</hi> May not our minds be aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the fame of Philoſophers, great orators, or elegant compoſuiſts? Are we not generally much more motified, in not acquiring the applauſes of men, than not honoring Chriſt? If theſe things predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in our hearts and practice, <hi>is it not clear</hi> that we have been following our own wiſdom; and hereby prevented the faith of many ſtanding in the power of GOD? And is it poſſible in this caſe, to eſcape being guilty of the blood of ſouls? And if GOD is to try our hearts, and avenge ſuch blood upon unfaithful watchmen, to all eternity, then, theſe queries cannot be thought unſuitable by all, who <hi>believe and feel this solemn truth. How can</hi> the unfaithful meſſenger of Chriſt <hi>meet his eye</hi> at the judgment day? when all his deceitful handlings of his word are ſet before him! How can he meet the ſouls whom he has ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the regions of the damned? Imagination can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paint the horror of ſuch Judaſes—<hi>such castaways</hi> from GOD. And then to look forward, it is the Hell of hell, to conſider, that theſe horrors will never ceaſe. Do not our ſouls ſhudder in view of the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſcene? and cry "<hi>Lord Jesus, Saviour of sinners, save us from this practice, and this end.</hi>" On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, can we claim as our apoſtle, that our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exhibiting divine truth is in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power? Does Chriſt fill our hearts, and fill our diſcourſes? Doth the love we bear to him and his truth extinguiſh every idea of preaching
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033960_0026_0FF9DA07399F57C0"/>ourſelves? Amidſt the great objects of the goſpel and eternity, do our own intereſts appear leſs than nothing? And do thoſe immenſe objects ſo entirely abſorb our attention and feelings that we are ready to lay down our lives for their promotion? Do we lay open to our hearers without <hi>disguise the badness of their hearts</hi>—their poſitive guilt and danger while impenitent? Do we utter forth the words of life in their ſimplicity, purity, plainneſs, pungency and power? If ſo, we are following in our degree the example of Chriſt and his apoſtles. Let us be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to perſevere. Let us warn every man and exhort every man <hi>with tears.</hi> O that there might be a ſacred harmony between our preaching and practice. Let us not fear them that kill the body or ſpeak <hi>as pleasing men, but</hi> GOD <hi>who trieth our hearts.</hi> Then we may look forward with comfort. The word adminiſtered by us will give opportunity for the faith of GOD's children to ſtand in the power of GOD. Unbelievers will have no cloke for their ſin— and when we come to the cloſe of our labors, we may with the holy apoſtle look back with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a good conſcience and ſay, "We have fought a good fight, we have finiſhed our courſe—we have kept the faith, and henceforth there is laid up for us, a crown of righteouneſs, which the Lord the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous judge, ſhall give us at that day." And ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from his lips the joyful ſentence "Well done, good and faithful ſervants enter ye into the joy of your Lord.—</p>
            <p>Let theſe ſolemn and joyful reflections likewiſe be addreſſed in a ſpecial manner to the Candidate Elect.</p>

               <hi>Dear Sir</hi>—May theſe exhortations which we receive as agreeable to the mind of Chriſt ſink down into your ears. This day you are ſolemnly to be ſeparated to the goſpel miniſtry by the laying on of the hands of the preſbytery. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal will be the conſequences of this tranſaction. It is taken for granted you have already reſolved to follow the example contemplated at this time: but
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:033960_0027_0FF9DA1A37EBA898"/>a reſolution in your own ſtrength is not ſuſſicient. <hi>Resolve in the strength of Christ.</hi> Be exhorted to look well to your own heart. <hi>Have you not ſelt the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of enticing words in your own experience?</hi> Shun theſe as you would death.—Should you now fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their uſe, in dealing with periſhing ſouls, after ſuch awakening admonitions as GOD has given you, <hi>your condemnation</hi> will be great. But, in gratitude to Him who brings back his wandering ſheep, and is now giving you an opportunity to ſpeak in his name, <hi>be persuaded to act the part of our apostle faithſully.</hi> With his animating example before you, <hi>enter into the life and spirit of it.</hi>—Let the apoſtles character be <hi>seen in you</hi>—in your preaching—your ardour for the good of ſouls, and reſolution to fulfil the teſtimony of GOD. In order to this you muſt be a man of prayer—you muſt be daily anointed from on high, and baptiſed with the Holy Ghoſt. You muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign every worldly concern, honor, or pleaſure which interferes with the <hi>holy skill</hi> of preaching, in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the ſpirit and of power. And finally, think not your life dear unto yourſelf, if you may finiſh your courſe with joy, and the miniſtry you have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtify the goſpel of the grace of GOD—And be thou faithful unto the death, and when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, thou ſhalt receive a crown of life which ſhall not fade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the church and people of this society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are you deſirous that the great Head of the Church, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould place a light in this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick? The tranſactions of this day <hi>maniſest</hi> this deſire.—But what will be the conſequences of the goſpel's being preached to you in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power?</p>
            <p>You will have every excuſe <hi>for not becoming holy</hi> wreſted from your hands—You will have every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for not appearing on the right hand of the Judge at the laſt day, taken from you—and you will have every <hi>delusive plea for <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> eternal misery,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033960_0028_0FF9DA308AC2F588"/>vanish</hi> from your ſight. While the goſpel ſhines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round you, like the blaze of light, around the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at his converſion, will you <hi>like him be convicted and converted?</hi> Will you yield <hi>your whole souls to Christ</hi> and make him your portion? If you do this how happy will be the conſequences—You will have eternal reaſon to bleſs GOD for the light he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, and the power of his ſpirit which has made it effectual to your ſalvation. But how alarming is the light of the goſpel to ſuch as reſiſt its beams and influence? To them it is a ſavour of death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death!! "It had been better for them; ſaid another apoſtle; not to have known the way of rightcouſneſs than after they had known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them." Guilt and puniſhment ever increaſe in proportion to means reſiſted and overcome—You cannot now ſin at ſo cheap a rate as before—raiſed to Heaven in point of privileges, you will only ſink deeper in eternal woe. O be entreated to conſider that the very deſign of preaching the goſpel in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the ſpirit and power is for your beſt good, and there is <hi>no alternative, you must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and converted, or be damned to all eternity!</hi> Be exhorted therefore in the language of this apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, "Not to receive the grace of God in vain. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation." Delay not a moment—fly from the wrath which is coming—embrace the Saviour. O think if once you are impriſoned in the burning pit, GOD himſelf will be unto you a "conſuming fire" —and the tempeſt of his wrath will beat upon you forever!—O ſinner, O unbeliever <hi>do put on as much consideration as the Father of lies, and tremlle for yourselves.</hi> To tremble now may be <hi>your life.</hi> O be exhorted to lay aſide your falſe hopes of Heaven —your ſorbidden pleaſures and amuſements. Seize the preſent moment as it flies. Yon deteſt the crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal who while he waits his execution ſells his body —provides the intoxicating potion—and ſlupiſies
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:033960_0029_0FF9BF139CFFE788"/>his ſenſes till the fatal moment! <hi>Do not outdo him in mornity!</hi> Do not now ſell your <hi>precious time, and drown your never dying souls, in stupifying plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> till the pit awakes you, <hi>and Heaven's door is barred!!</hi> Your ſouls are <hi>too precious, infinitely too precious</hi> to be thrown away in this manner. Do be entreated to realize their worth, and not trifle while eternal happpineſs or woe, hangs on the preſent moment. O hear the glad tidings of ſalvation before it is too late. Trample not the blood of the Saviour under foot, "leaſt he be angry and ye periſh from the way." Defer not —make a total ſurrender of your hearts to him. And let <hi>one and all hear,</hi> ſo that our ſouls may live— "The ſpirit and the bride ſay come—and let him that heareth ſay come—and let him that is athirſt come, and take of the water of life freely." And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever now ſhall approach the ſtreams of divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation found in the goſpel, and taſte their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence ſhall never die: they ſhall begin the reliſh of original life and pleaſure here, and continue to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low back thoſe ſtreams till they arrive at the infinite fountain in the preſence of GOD, where they ſhall <hi>live</hi> to refreſh their ſouls with greater and greater draughts of divine felicity through eternity.</p>

            <p>SAG-HARBOUR is a ſea-port lying at the eaſt end of Long-Iſland. Has an excellent harbor, wharves, &amp;c.—and is finely ſituated for trade and navigation—Before the late war, the town was thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabited. Thoſe who tarried through that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural conteſt, ſuffered greatly in every intereſt and feeling from the ravages of the enemy—But ſince the eſtabliſhment of peace they have increaſed rapidly, and buſineſs of every kind flouriſhes At preſent the place contains nearly one hundred dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſes, and one hundred and ſiſty families—The ſociety was incorporated in the year 1790, about which time a happy revival of religion took place, and a congregational church was organized the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. The people early erected an houſe for public worſhip, and obtained occaſional preaching. But were not happy enough, to enjoy the ſtated adminiſtrations of the goſpel till May, 1796, when Mr. Daniel Hall, by application, preached among them. And finding his labors acceptable, and promiſing much ſpiritual benefit proceeded to invite him to ſettle among them as their Paſtor— After his acceptance of their invitation, and other preparitory meaſures, he was ordained by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Preſbytery Sept. 21ſt 1797.</p>
