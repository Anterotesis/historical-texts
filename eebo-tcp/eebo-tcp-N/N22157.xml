            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Here have I wearied my aged limbs, pacing with anxious steps, in expectation of my childs return; some accident sure has happened, she would not have staid thus long else to torture her father's heart; some sad omen shakes my decayed frame, and tells me we shall not meet again. Last night when rosy slumbers stole upon my care-worn mind, methought Phoebus in splendor ne'er had shone so bright; all the earth seem'd richen'd with his orient beams; when soon and sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, as if nature revolted and hurl'd black curtains 'twixt the sun and earth, flashes of streaming fire

burst through his contending screens, and waters gush'd, as if to drown the earth! the savage beasts for shelter ran precipitate with horrid yell from place to place, and heaven's feathered couriers with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded wings floated breathless down the engulphed precipices!—A ship then appeared in view tossing among the billows, she dashed against the rocks; in that dire moment the schrieking of the victims rous'd me from my lethargy, and it struck so strong impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on my senses, that for some time I thought 'twas real.

Sound mayst thou sleep, had I my wish, indeed so sound, that thy immortal parts, the devil might call his own, before the morrows dawn. My friend!

Oh Pedras, unfortunate for thee, that I have found thee out· I loved thee once, 'tis true, but now my mind is much altered.

equally as bad? aye worse, if possible! but still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to all but Pedras. Truly, the two Americans have but little cause to believe me honest, but for their own sakes, they will not tell how basely they were treated by me. Don Pedras appears to me a faithful friend—so do I to him. He like myself, may wear the mask of friendship only, which now necessity commands; be that as it may, I am resolved, fix'd, and imovable—though remorse increase, as sins accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate, I cannot now avoid the worst.</p>

Then Angels from Heaven descended, in whose arms her fleeting soul, majestically was born—
