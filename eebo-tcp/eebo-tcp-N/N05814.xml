            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Z</seg>EPHANIAH</hi> was ſent to GOD'S people in the days of <hi>Joſiah</hi> king of <hi>Judah,</hi> whoſe reign was vaſtly different from that of his father <hi>Amon.</hi> Of <hi>Amon</hi> we read,<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Kings 21 20</note> 
               <hi>That he did evil in the ſight of the Lord, ſerved idols, and forſook the God of his fathers</hi>: But when <hi>Joſiah</hi> his ſon came to the Throne, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of treading in his father's ſteps, he ſoon ſet about a work of reformation among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and was greatly ſucceeded in his endeavours for that end.— But yet after a while, the time
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007383_0005_102B8CF342D1F838"/>
came, when this great and good work abated, and the people ſhamefully return'd to their old ſins again— Upon this, God ſent his ſervant the prophet to them, to reprove them for their ſins, warn them of the judgments that were coming on them, and to perſuade them to repent of their evil deeds, that ſo God might turn from the fierceneſs of his anger, and repent of the evil, he had tho't to do unto them.</p>
            <p>THE particular judgment they were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with was the coming of their BABYLONISH enemies, who ſhould make great havock, and ſlaughter among them; which is here call'd the <hi>day of the Lord's ſacrifice</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">context. verſe 8.</note>. becauſe much blood would then be ſhed, and the ſlain of the Lord be multiplied—and left they ſhould put this evil day far away, the prophet aſſured them, that <hi>it was near,</hi> and <hi>haſted greatly.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">verſe 14.</note> And that he might thro'ly awaken them, he ſpeaks of this day of their calamity, which was haſtening on them, in all the expreſſions of dread and terror that can be. He therefore calls it, <hi>the Day of the Lord,</hi> the great day of the Lord, a day of wrath, of trouble, and diſtreſs; a day of waſteneſs, and deſolation; and in the words I have choſen for my text— <hi>a day of darkneſs,</hi> i. e. a day of great calamity, and diſtreſs, a day when every thing round them ſhould look with a dark and melancholly aſpect on them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:007383_0006_102B8CF569499098"/>Now, as this was the caſe of God's people then, ſo it alſo ſometimes is, of a people at this day; and I can't but think, that they whoſe <hi>hearts are wiſe to diſcern time and judgment,</hi> look upon this to be very much our own caſe, and think the preſent day, a day of darkneſs with us. And if ſo, then I hope, it will not be tho't, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foreign to the buſineſs of this day; if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of diſcourſing of the divine original of civil government, and how great a bleſſing it is to mankind; of the qualifications of civil rulers, and their duty to the people under their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and alſo, the duty of a people to thoſe in civil authority over them; (which are ſubjects that have been ſo often handled, on this anniverſary ſolemnity) I ſhould come to you with a few meditations, on the words I have pitched upon for my text—<hi>a day of darkneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE in diſcourſing from them, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, by divine help, to conſider, and ſhew theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN it may be ſaid to be a day of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with a people; or when their caſe may be dark and melancholly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WHAT is the duty of a people at ſuch a day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN it may be ſaid to be a day of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with a people; or when their caſe may be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007383_0007_102B8CF703322168"/>
dark and melancholly. And here it may be ſaid,—it is ſuch a day with them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHEN it is a day of great apoſtacy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion, and many heaven-provoking ſins are to be ſeen in the midſt of them.—So contrary both to the law and nature of God is ſin, that he can't but be provok'd with it, and it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly offenſive to him in his own covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people; nor will he let it go unpuniſh'd in them. <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore will I puniſh you, for all your iniquities.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Amos 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>Shall I not viſit for theſe things ſaith the Lord? ſhall not my ſoul be avenged on ſuch a nation as this?</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Jer. 5.29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>ISRAEL were a peculiar people to him, and a people for whom he had done more, than for any other nation under heaven; but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very ſinful and apoſtate: and therefore he bro't that charge againſt them,<note n="§" place="bottom">Iſa. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>I have nouriſh'd, and brought up children, but they have rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; the ox knoweth his owner, and the aſs his maſters crib, but my people doth not know, Iſrael doth not conſider</hi>; and the lamentation made over them; <hi>Ah ſinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, &amp;c.</hi> And the heaven and earth were called to witneſs againſt them, and to ſtand amaz'd at their ingratitude and rebellion, — <hi>Be aſtoniſhed, O ye heavens at this, and be horribly afraid; be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007383_0008_102B8CF8E0D30F98"/>
ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord; for my people have committed two evils, they have forſaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out ciſterns, broken ciſterns that can hold no water.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. 2.12; I3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND as that was the caſe of God's antient people, ſo it may be the caſe of a people at this day; and when it is ſo, they are in a very ſad and melancholly one; for what can have a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, aſpect on them, than the abounding of drunkeneſs, prophaneneſs, uncleanneſs, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, injuſtice, extortion, oppreſſion, &amp;c? verily, when this is their caſe, they may well tremble for fear of God, and be afraid of his judgments—Theſe and ſuch like ſins, may turn the ſmiles of providence into frowns, and pull down the judgments of heaven on them, and herefor, God may be provoked to make them deſolate, a land not inhabited.</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. SUCH a day it is alſo with a people, when religion, pure and undefiled religion, which was once their glory, is apace languiſhing and dying; among them—Religion is an honour both to particular perſons, and alſo to a people; it is ſo to perſons of all orders and ages, high and low, rich and poor, old and young, yea, to kings and princes, rulers, and judges of the earth.—The
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007383_0009_102B8CFB8A71F728"/>
emperor <hi>Theodoſius</hi> therefore once ſaid, <hi>he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is a greater honour and joy to him, that he was a member of a church, than emperor of the world.</hi> The flouriſhing of religion, will exalt a people, but the decay of it, be a reproach to them—If it be aſk'd—when is religion evidently decaying among a people? I anſwer, it is ſo, when the profeſſors of it have loſt that zeal (I don't mean a blind enthuſiaſtick zeal, but a true chriſtian zeal, and a zeal according to knowledge) which once they had; and are become indifferent in religion—when, like the church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> they are lukewarm, and neither cold, nor hot—and when like the church of <hi>Epheſuſ, they have loſt their firſt love</hi>—when the day of the Lord, which once was ſanctified, is ſhamefully broken, and due care not to put a ſtop thereto, by thoſe whoſe proper buſineſs it is to do it—when the worſhip, and ordinances of God's houſe are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the duties of religion become tireſome to them—when the faithful meſſengers of God, and his meſſages by them are ſlighted, ſo that they have reaſon to complaim, <hi>who hath believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? Verily, I have laboured in vain, &amp;c.</hi>—when the ſupport of the goſpel, and the faithful miniſters of Chriſt, is looked upon as a burthen too heavy for them to bear, and what they do towards it not chearfully, but grudgingly— when family religion, government, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction are greatly wanting, and they who
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007383_0010_102B8CFDC99B9070"/>
ſhould ſupport them, become lovers of pleaſure, and of the world, more than of God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: when this, I ſay, is the caſe of a people, religion is plainly upon the decline, and it is a dark day with them, for what can they expect, unleſs they remember from whence they are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, and repent, and do their firſt works, but that God come unto them quickly, and remove their candleſtick out of it's place, take away his gospel from them, turn their teachers into cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and ſend that dreadful famine among them, not a famine of bread, nor a thirſt for water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord— Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. SUCH a day is it with a people, when for their ſins, God threatens, or viſits them with thoſe ſore judgments, the famine, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſword.—It is ſo, when God calls for a dearth, by reaſon of which, they are threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſcarcity of bread. Rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, are great ſmiles of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and when God gives both the former, and the latter rain in their ſeaſon, bleſſing the ſpringing of the year, and alſo crowning it with his great goodneſs; ſo that there is graſs for the cattle, and herb for the ſervice of man, a tribute of praiſe is due to him therefor—Now that God who is the father of the rain, and who begetteth the drops of the dew, who ſometimes visits the earth, and waters it with the river of God,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007383_0011_102B8CFF542C94D0"/>
which is full of water, can, when he pleaſeth, ſtop the bottles of heaven, upon which, inſtead of cooling and refreſhing ſhowers, conſtant ſcorching heats, and ſcarcity follow.—This judgment God threatned his people with; <hi>I will conſume them by famine.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Jer. 14.12.</note> This judgment he alſo brought upon them, telling them at the ſame time, why he ſent it, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they built their own houſes in a coſtly manner, and let his houſe lie waſte. <hi>Ye looked for much, and to it came to little, and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it: why? ſaith the Lord of hoſts: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of mine houſe that is waſte, and ye run every man unto his own houſe.

            <p>AND when this is the caſe of a people, what a diſtreſſing time is it!—<hi>when the heaven over their head is braſs, and the earth under them is iron, and the rain of their land powder and dust—when the vine is dried up, the apple tree, and all the trees of the field are withered. When the land mourneth,</hi> becauſe the harveſt of the field is periſhed—when the beaſts groan, and the herds of cattle are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, becauſe they have no paſture, and the flocks of ſheep are made deſolate—when the fire devoureth the paſtures of the wilderneſs, and

the flame burneth up the trees of the wood, and the beaſts of the field cry, becauſe the rivers of waters are dried up.—See the diſtreſs of ſuch a ſeaſon ſpoken of by the prophet,—<hi>Judah mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and the gates thereof languiſh, they are black to the ground, and the cry of Jeruſalem is gone up: becauſe the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the plow-men were aſhamed, they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their heads.

            <p>AGAIN, ſuch a day it is alſo, when God ſends contagious and mortal ſickneſs among them. This is another of thoſe judgments God threatned his people with, in caſe of diſobedience. <hi>The Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy ſeed, even great plagues, and of long continuance; and ſore ſickneſs, and of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, ſuch a day alſo it is when the people are call'd to hear the ſound of the trumpet and the alarm of war.</p>
            <p>PEACE on honorable terms, when every one can ſit quietly under his own vine and fig-tree, and there be none to make them afraid, is a great favour of heaven; and the time will come, when the bow ſhall be broken, the chariot burnt in the fire, and wars ceaſe from one end of the earth to the other. The time, when they ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks: nation ſhall not lift up the ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more; and then inſtead of wars and fightings which proceed from the luſts of men, the wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard lie down with the kid, the calf, the young

            <p>THERE are thoſe, I am ſenſible, who doubt the lawfulneſs of chriſtians making war on any occaſion; but to me it ſeems plain there can be no juſt ground therefor either from reaſon or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: for when the ſoldiers came to <hi>John</hi> the baptiſt, the fore-runner of Chriſt, with that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, <hi>what ſhall we do?</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Luke 3.14</note> he didn't order them to lay down their arms, telling them there would be no need of men of a military character, and martial ſpirit under the goſpel; but taught them how to behave in the ſtation they were in: <hi>do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſly, and be content with your wages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOT that chriſtians ſhould delight in war, ſhedding blood, preying upon, and deſtroying one another; no, by no means, for this don't become reaſonable creatures, much leſs chriſtians—but yet, a martial ſpirit is a noble ſpirit, and ſoldiers, expert in war, of good conduct,

and undaunted courage, are an honor to their country, and the ſafety of a people, under God, depends not a little on them; and to take up arms both offenſively and defenſively, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times abſolutely neceſſary. The inſults, inroads and encroachments of their ambitious and perfidious enemies upon them, the preſervation of their religion, rights, and properties, yea, their lives, and the lives of theirs, call aloud hereto; and then their ſtate is melancholly.—Thus it is, when great preparations for war are making both by ſea and land, fleets man'd and ready for action, land-forces alſo rais'd, well-arm'd, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſciplined, and prepared to march.</p>
            <p>THUS it is alſo, when war is publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and that cry heard; prepare war, wake up the, mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up— beat your plow-ſhares into ſwords, and your pruning hooks into ſpears, let the weak ſay, I am ſtrong; order the buckler and ſhield, and draw near to battle; harneſs the horſes, mount ye horſemen, and ſtand forth with your helmets, furniſh the ſpears, put on the brigandines.—The ſword! O how much human blood has been ſpilt by it! yea, what a field of blood has it often made of whole kingdoms and countries! every battle of the warriour, being with confuſed noiſe, and garments roll'd in blood: What a dark day then
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007383_0016_102B8D084BF7B0B0"/>
when it is drawn!—Such a day it is, when God ſuffers enemies to diſtreſs them, by making inroads upon their expoſed borders, deſtroying not only their ſubſtance but the lives of ſome and carrying others into a doleful captivity—when enemies invade and make ſuch bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts againſt them, as oblige them, in their own defence, to march forth, and ſpeak with them in the gate—or when they themſelves are forming hazardous enterprizes, and important expeditions againſt their enemies, by which means great numbers of their brethren are call'd to jeopard their lives in the high places of the field.—But, how much darker the day ſtill! If the Lord of hoſts and God of armies, and whoſe is the victory, inſtead of being on their ſide, and fighting their battles for them, ſhould fight againſt them, making them either to flee before their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, fall by their ſword, or be led captive by them.</p>
            <p>I SPEAK not thus, to damp in the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the courage of thoſe brave ſoldiers, who are gone or going forth in the ſervice of their king and country: No, God forbid, for were they all here before God this day, I would hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily encourage them, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when invaded by <hi>Sennacherib, Be ſtrong and courageous, be not afraid, nor diſmayed for the king of Aſſyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him, for there is more with us, than with him; with him is an arm of fleſh, but with us is the Lord

            <p>I proceed to ſay in the next place,</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi rend="sup">thly.</hi> IT is a day of darkneſs &amp;c. when a truly generous publick-ſpirit is much wanting, and a narrow, coveteous and ſelfiſh one prevails.</p>
            <p>No man was born for himſelf; nor ſhould any one ſeek his own, but every one another's wealth. A publick-ſpirit is a noble and truly chriſtian ſpirit, but a narrow and contracted one is mean and ſordid; and they who are of ſuch a ſpirit, are often very far from being the perſons they feign themſelves to be; they may ſpeak fair, pretend a generous love to mankind, and concern for the common welfare of the places where they live; but SELF is at the bottom, and they will not be likely to lay out themſelves to ſerve the publick, unleſs they can ſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the ſame time. — This ſpirit, inſtead of inclining them to feed the hungry, and cloath the naked, will rather diſpoſe them to vex, grieve and grind the face of the poor; and do ſuch mean and ungenerous actions, as they ought to abhor and be aſhamed of; and what
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007383_0018_102B8D0CD2F2B928"/>
may not perſons of this ſpirit be often bribed to do?</p>
            <p>BUT on the other hand, perſons of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and publick ſpirit, will be uſeful and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable both in church and ſtate, and bleſſings to the places where they live.—They will deſire, and endeavour to do good to all, as they have opportunity, and contrive how others may be the better for them—like the liberal man, they will deviſe liberal things, and by liberal things ſhall they ſtand.—</p>
            <p>ARE they in civil authority, they will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be juſt, ruling in the fear of God; and by no means will they be perſwaded to betray their truſt. They will ſincerely endeavour to know the duty of the ſtation they are in, and as ſincerely endeavour faithfully to perform it.</p>
            <p>WE read of <hi>Mordecai, that he was next to the king, great among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, ſeeking the wealth of his people and ſpeaking peace to all his ſeed.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Eſther 10.3</note> He was good (ſays one) as well as great, and his greatneſs gave him an opportunity of doing the more good—He did not ſeek his own wealth; and how to make an eſtate for himſelf and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is the chief thing many aim at, when they get into great places at court; but conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the welfare of his people, and made it his buſineſs to advance the ſame: He improved his power, wealth, and intereſt with the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> for the publick good, did not ſide with one party againſt another, but endeavour'd to be a common father to all; and herefor was he univerſally accepted and eſteemed—And perſons of a public ſpirit (as <hi>Mordecai</hi> was) will endeavour to do as he did, and be accepted of the multitude of their brethren as he was—But when perſons of his character are few and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a contrary one are numerous, a people are in dark and melancholy caſe.</p>

            <p>GOD is the God of love and peace, and where theſe are, he will dwell; but the want of them will provoke him to depart.—<hi>Behold how good and pleaſant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. To our civil Rulers; who we hope, will act the part of Fathers to us at ſuch a dark day as the preſent one is.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:007383_0026_102B8D1C204AB170"/>AND may I be allowed in the firſt place to addreſs myſelf to <hi>You, Sir,</hi> who have the honor to ſit in the firſt chair of government—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your</hi> EXCELLENCY,</p>
            <p>WE can't but eſteem you a Gentleman of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior powers and talents, to be One formed for government, and therefore the better qualified for the honor which God and the king have put upon you, and to fill the chair you are in—</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>SINCE the reins of government are in your hands, at ſuch a dark day as the preſent one is, and at ſo critical a conjuncture—what can you deſire better, <hi>Sir,</hi> for yourſelf, or this people for you, than the divine preſence with you, to ſupport, and encourage you under the weight of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic cares; and that he who is the father of lights, who is wiſdom, and in whom is no darkneſs at all, would give unto you that wiſdom, which ſhall be profitable to direct, at ſuch a day as this is; and would enable you, thro' the whole of your adminiſtration, ſo to conduct yourſelf, as to make this people eaſy, and happy under it,— ſo alſo as to approve yourſelf to him, who is King of kings, and Lord of lords, who ſtandeth in the congregation of the mighty, and who judgeth among the gods, to your royal maſter alſo, one of the beſt of kings, to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007383_0027_102B8D1E27CF44D8"/>
to the people under your government, and to Chriſt the judge of all, to whom you, <hi>Sir,</hi> as well as we, muſt one day give an account.</p>
            <p>YOUR Excellency can't but be well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſtate, and circumſtances of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; the better able therefore to judge, what will ſerve the beſt intereſts of it; and our earneſt deſire is, that you would exert yourſelf to the uttermoſt, to promote and advance the ſame.</p>
            <p>A PROVINCE, that look upon themſelves more happy, under the Britiſh conſtitution—a province, more loyal to his majeſty KING <hi>GEORGE,</hi> and more firmly attached to the illuſtrious houſe of <hi>HANOVER,</hi> I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, is not in all the <hi>KING</hi>'s dominions: we therefore hope, that while on the one hand you maintain his <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s prerogative, you will on the other, be tender of the liberties of this people; and alſo uſe your beſt intereſt, in the court of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that we may ſtill enjoy the favour, both of the KING, and his miniſters.</p>
            <p>ONE thing which will greatly add to the weight of government on you, is, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent aſpect of providence, and from the great military preparations, that have been made, and are ſtill making in <hi>Great-Britain, France</hi> and NORTH-AMERICA, we may expect ſoon to hear the ſound of the trumpet, and the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007383_0028_102B8D2014CF4158"/>
alarm to war; and if we ſhould, what part of his majeſty's dominions, more like to be the ſeat of it, than theſe <hi>Northern-Colonies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IS not <hi>North-America</hi> what <hi>France</hi> has long envied us, and has been and ſtill is making very bold attempts (which God of his infinite mercy prevent) to become maſters of?—Since therefore the conduct of the affairs of a war, and particularly, of one important undertaking, is devolved upon you, and you are call'd (as we hear) to go forth in perſon and head the forces under your command—our hearty wiſh, and earneſt prayer for you, is, that the Lord, who is a man of war, would <hi>teach your hands to war, and your fingers to fight,</hi> (and would do the ſame to officers and ſoldiers under you, that ſo they may play the man for their people, and for the cities of our God) would carry you thro' the many fatigues, and difficulties you may meet with, and preſerve you in every danger, ſucceed you in the hazardous enterprize before you, and enable you, ſo to conduct the ſame, as to come off with honor, and applauſe, and approve yourſelf a good ſoldier, as well as a wiſe governor:— And,</p>
            <p>SUFFER me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to add, without offence, We hope you will think it worthy your care, that our brethren, who ſhall ſo freely venture their lives, in the ſervice of their <hi>king</hi> and <hi>country,</hi> have no juſt cauſe to complain of wrong and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007383_0029_102B8D21EBB70658"/>
injury done them; but receive a due recompence of reward—Thus to act your part, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear you, <hi>Sir,</hi> to this people, gain you love and honor from them, afford you inward peace, and calmneſs of mind, whenever providence ſhall call you to reſign the chair, and quit the preſent ſtage of action, and what is greater than all, will give you boldneſs in the day of the Lord Jeſus.—</p>
            <p>I SHALL in the next place addreſs myſelf to the gentlemen, who are immediately concern'd in the elections of this day: HIS MAJESTY'S HONORABLE COUNCIL, AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,</p>
            <p>Gentlemen,</p>
            <p>THE charter privileges, which, under God and the king, we yet enjoy, are great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable; priviledges, handed down to us from our fathers, and which (pray God) may be handed down from us to our children after us, even to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>THE election of perſons, to ſit at the council board, and aſſiſt, and adviſe the king's gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, is with you; and if the moſt ſuitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for that end, are not elected, where muſt the blame lie?—Since therefore this is the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular buſineſs of this day, I would in the firſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007383_0030_102B8D24139759B0"/>
place remind you, that the time is coming, when you will be called to an account for the tranſactions of this day; and the views and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, with which you ſhall act, be enquired into—And that therefore it highly concerns you, ſeriouſly to conſider, whether your proceedings are ſuch, as you can anſwer to your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and to this people now, and to Chriſt in the great day.—And then ſuffer me, in the name and fear of God, to beſeech you, to <hi>have your eyes upon the faithful in the land</hi>; chooſe men, who, you have reaſon to think, fear God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor the king, are true friends to the province, and will ſtand up for the privileges of it, religious as well as civil.</p>
            <p>DON'T let any have your votes, becauſe they are of this or that party, or will be moſt likely to ſerve this or that particular intereſt, or to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on this or that particular ſcheme—but ſuch as you think in conſcience, are beſt qualified for a ſeat at that HONORABLE BOARD, and moſt likely to ſerve the public.</p>
            <p>WHEN was there greater need of men of ſenſe, and wiſdom, judgment and prudence, foreſight and inſight, than at this day? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore elect <hi>ſuch as are underſtanding in the times,</hi> and are moſt likely <hi>to know what Iſrael ought to do.</hi> Men, of integrity and honeſty, ſteadineſs and reſolution, not given to change, and that will
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007383_0031_102B8D2617DAEF00"/>
not ſuffer themſelves to be made Tools; men, not of a narrow &amp; ſelfiſh, but public ſpirit, &amp; that will be moſt likely to advance, not their own private intereſt, but the welfare of the province: men, not only of wiſdom, and ſo moſt capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing in every important affair; but of courage and boldneſs, and who will not be afraid to ſpeak their minds, and give their advice freely, when called thereto: men of religion, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, lovers of learning, and friends to the <hi>College,</hi> that ſociety, which our fore-fathers ſo early founded, and where many of the ſons of <hi>New-England</hi> have been educated, who have been eminently uſeful, both in church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>AND when the elections of this day ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and ye proceed to public buſineſs, let your firſt concern be, faithfully to diſcharge the duty of the ſtation ye are in.</p>
            <p>YE will doubtleſs have laid before you, affairs of great importance, and that will require the whole of your time; avoid therefore running into parties, and entering into ſuch debates, as will be likely to iſſue, only in a miſpence of time, and encreaſe of charge to the province.</p>
            <p>ENDEAVOUR after unanimity and diſpatch, but do nothing raſhly.</p>
            <p>THE power put into your hands, by the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007383_0032_102B8D28E3A44098"/>
charter, and laws of the province, is not ſmall; uſe it well, and beware of abuſing it and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the limits of it. In all you do, act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, conſcientiouſly, impartially; and when in difficult and perplexing caſes, you are at a loſs what to do, remember thoſe words of the <hi>apoſtle; if any of you lack wiſdom, let him aſk it of God.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">James 1.5.</note> In all your ways acknowledge him, and may he direct your paths for you.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now briefly addreſs the whole body of this people and ſo finiſh.</p>
            <p>AND is it as we have heard, let me then in the name and fear of God, exhort you to a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and general reformation. Reformation is what has been often preſs'd upon you, and, if I miſtake not, from this deſk, on this anniverſary ſolemnity; but how little is there to be ſeen of it! may not God complain of this people, after all his dealings with us, as he did of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation, <hi>they have made their faces harder than a rock, they have refuſed to return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IS a reformation too late now, and is there no hope or poſſibility of it? God forbid; for his ſake then, your own ſakes, and the ſake of yours after you, let every one ſet about it in earneſt. May our civil rulers, not only of a higher but lower order, all cloathed with any authority, put their hand to it:—<hi>Ariſe, for this matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007383_0033_102B8D2ACBE739D8"/>
unto you, be of good courage then, and do it.</hi> This is alſo, what the Lord's miniſters are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſibly obliged to, let not any of us then be wanting in doing our part toward it. But it is to be feared, this work will not be effected, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs heads of families alſo engage in it: A family<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformation would ſoon bring on a general one.</p>
            <p>TILL this is the caſe with us, we may look for light, but behold darkneſs; for peace, but no good will come; and juſtly expect to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd yet ſeven times for our iniquities. But ſhould we at length become a penitent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed people; we might then hope, that light would ariſe to us under all our darkneſs, and that we ſhould ſee joy and gladneſs, according to the days wherein we have ſeen evil, and the years wherein we have been afflicted; that we ſhould have the divine preſence with, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on us, in all important affairs, both of a civil, religious and military nature, that God, even our own God, would bleſs us, glory yet dwell in our land, and we be that happy people, whoſe God is the Lord, and it be ſaid of us, as it was of <hi>Iſrael, There is none like unto the God of Jeſhurun, who rideth upon the Heaven in thine help, and his excellency upon the ſky. The eternal God is thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and underneath are the everlaſting arms: and he ſhall thruſt out the enemy from before thee, and ſhall ſay, deſtroy them.—Happy art thou, O Iſrael: Who is like unto thee, O people ſaved by the lord, the ſhield
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007383_0034_102B8D2CACDA3938"/>
of thine help, and who is the ſword of thine excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy! And thine enemies ſhall be found liars unto thee, and thou ſhalt tread upon their high places.</hi>
