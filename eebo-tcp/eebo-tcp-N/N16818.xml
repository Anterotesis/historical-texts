            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A BLACKSMITH in a country town, while ſhoeing a horſe, was gazed at by a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of negroes as they were paſſing by; being a little piqued at being the object of the blacks' at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and attempting to caſt a ſlur upon them, he ſaid, "<hi>I believe hell's broke looſe.</hi>"—"<hi>Yes, maſſa,</hi>" ſays one, "<hi>I ſee de devil got hold de horſe's foot.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="2">2. A tradeſman, whoſe love of money made him preſcribe, as beneficial to his ſervants' health, and his own profit, <hi>the practice of early riſing,</hi> one morning gave a poor <hi>black man</hi> a ſevere ſcolding for ſuffering the ſun to ſhine on him while in bed—concluding his lectures with a ſevere threat, if he ſhould ever after find him not up at ſun riſe. "At ſunriſe, maſſa?" aſked the honeſt African, in the native ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of his ſoul—it was worth a caſket of dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds to him—"At ſun-riſe, maſſa? But ſuppoſe, maſſa, the ſun riſe before day-light—what ſhall I do den, ſir?" The maſter made no reply, and <hi>Sambo</hi> was diſmiſſed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A very pious gentleman, but rather worldly, who lives not many miles from Boſton, made it his conſtant practice to call up his family before day, in order that they might attend prayers, and be ready for their labour in good ſeaſon: one morning having muſtered his family rather earlier than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, he commenced family duties by prayer, during which, he returned thanks to the Lord, that they
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021642_0004_0FB4EA4A02F44190"/>
were brought to ſee the light of <hi>another day:</hi> an old negro ſtanding by, cried out, "<hi>Top, top, vate a bit, no day yet, maſſa, ſartin, no day yet.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="4">4. Soon after the peace, a merchant in Wilming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. North Carolina, wrote to one of the principal ſhippers in London, an order to ſend out thirty thouſand <hi>black tacks;</hi> the writing being indifferent, the gentleman thought it meant <hi>black jacks;</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the order appeared a little romantic, he uſed his utmoſt endeavours to comply with it. After collecting in London, Birmingham and Sheffield, he could only glean up ten thouſand, which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched with an apology that he could not then complete the order, but was in hopes in a ſhort time <hi>he ſhould be able to ſend the remainder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. When the French ſleet, during the late war, entered the Britiſh channel, the Engliſh fleet under ſir Charles Hardy, ſtood away, as if bearing for port; a jack tar, on board the Royal George, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this proceeding, went below, and bringing up his hammock, went to the head of the ſhip, which had the figure of George II. for its ornament—"<hi>Let me, old boy,</hi>" ſaid he, "<hi>muffle you, for damn me but it would hurt you too much to ſee us running away.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="6">6. Mr. Mackenzie, who has ſometimes been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Scots <hi>Addiſon,</hi> is by profeſſion an attorney. He was lately in company with ſir William Howe, in the Highlands of Scotland. After dinner, the converſation happened to turn upon poiſon; the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effects of different ſpecies were mentioned, and among others, thoſe of ratſbane and laurel water. "We ſay in England," ſaid the general to mr. Mackenzie, "that <hi>ratſbane</hi> will not kill a lawyer."—"And we ſay in Scotland," replied the wit, "that ſome generals are in no danger from <hi>laurel.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="7">7. A certain young gentleman, well known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>choice ſpirits</hi> of Charleſton, South Carolina, for ſinging a good ſong, being lately recovered from an indiſpoſition, which made him look rather down
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021642_0005_0FB4EA4C2B8386C0"/>
in the mouth, was accoſted by an old acquaintance, with, "how are you, my buck? don't you feel very ugly at preſent?" "very ugly, indeed," replied the valetudinarian—"that's not to be wondered at nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," replies the other, "for ever ſince I firſt ſaw you, I always look'd upon you to be a <hi>d—d ugly fellow.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="8">8. Some years ſince, one <hi>Tom Hide,</hi> an Indian, famous for his cunning, went into a tavern at Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, in Maſſachuſetts, and after a little talk, told the landlord, he had been hunting, had killed a fine fat deer, and that if he would give him a quart of rum, he would tell him where it was.—The land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord did not wiſh to let ſlip ſo good an opportunity to obtain the veniſon, and immediately meaſured the Indian his rum—"Well," ſays Tom, "do you know where the great meadow is?" "Yes"—"Well, do you know, where the great marked maple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree that ſtands in it, is?"—"Yes"—"Well there lies the deer." A way poſted the taverner with his team, in queſt of his purchaſe: he found the meadow and the tree, it is true; but his ſearchings after the deer were in vain; and he returned no heavier, but in chagrin, than he went. Some days after, he met the Indian, and violently accuſed him of the deception. Tom heard him out, and with the coolneſs of a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher replied, "did you not find the meadow, as I ſaid?"—"Yes," "and the tree?"—"Yes"—"and the deer?"—"No."—"Very good," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues he—"you found <hi>two truths to one lie, which was very well for an Indian.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="9">9. A certain <hi>trading juſtice</hi> in Boſton, notorious for his <hi>profeſſional ingenuity,</hi> ſome time ſince employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a poor man to ſaw a load of wood, for which he agreed to give him <hi>eighteen-pence.</hi> The man, in order to be more expeditious in the buſineſs, ſtripped off his coat and laid it in the ſtreet.—After finiſhing the job, he found, to his ſurpriſe, that the coat had
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021642_0006_0FB4EA4EB8494958"/>
vaniſhed, and aſking the juſtice, who had been at the door, nearly the whole time, if he had ſeen any thing of it—the worthy magiſtrate replied, "he had <hi>found</hi> a coat in the ſtreet," and producing it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know, "if he could ſwear to the property;" on the poor man's anſwering in the affirmative, he proceeded to adminiſter the oath: after which, on reſtoring the coat, he ſhrewdly obſerved to the poor fellow, <hi>that they were now clear of each other, the price of the work being eighteen pence, and his fees amounting to the ſame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. A few years ſince, ſome boys, equipped in mock military accoutrements, ſuch as paper-caps, paper-belts, wooden ſwords, &amp;c. were beating up for recruits in Parliament-ſtreet, Boſton; their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant made a ſtand at a corner, and a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſoon collected about him, among whom were ſome officers of the Britiſh army, of the delicate caſt, then quartered in Boſton: young Kite delivered his ſpeech at the drum-head; after which many boys, candidates for military fame, preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be enliſted, were approved, and after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received dumps, in lieu of entrance-money, join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the party: among the reſt, a wretched little boy, bow-legged and otherwiſe deformed, offered himſelf as a volunteer to this corps of real <hi>infantry:</hi> on his approach, ſerjeant Kite, with a profound import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, cocked his hat, and after viewing him cap-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pee, with an air of ſupreme importance, "ſirrah," ſays he, "what do you mean? how durſt you inſult his majeſty's ſervice you a ſoldier! why you are a diſgrace to human nature; march off directly, or I ſhall chaſtiſe your preſumption." On this the poor rejected lad was retiring apace, when an arch boy, eyeing the ſpectators in ſcarlet with a look ſhrewdly expreſſive, at the ſame time pulling the ſerjeant by the ſleeve, "<hi>ſir,</hi>" ſays he, "<hi>call him back, call him back, he'll <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="11">11. During the late war, an Engliſh frigate hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come up the Patowmac, a party was landed,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021642_0007_0FB4EA5258B7ED38"/>
who ſet fire to and deſtroyed ſome gentlemen's houſes on the Maryland ſide in ſight of mount Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, general Waſhington's houſe; after which the captain, (I think captain Greaves of the Actaeon) ſent a boat on ſhore to the general's, demanding a large ſupply of proviſions, &amp;c. with a menace of burning it, likewiſe, in caſe of a refuſal. To which mr. Lund Waſhington replied, "That when gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waſhington engaged in the conteſt, he had put all to the ſtake, and was well aware of the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſituation of his houſe and property; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, he had given him orders by no means to comply with any ſuch demands, for that he would make no unworthy compromiſe with the enemy, and was ready to meet the fate of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours" The captain was highly incenſed on receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this anſwer, and removed his frigate to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia ſhore; but before he commenced his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ſent another meſſage to the ſame purport, offering likewiſe a paſſport to mr. Waſhington to come on board: he went accordingly in the boat, carrying with him a ſmall preſent of poultry, of which he begged the captain's acceptance. His preſence produced the beſt effect—he was hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly received, notwithſtanding he repeated the ſame ſentiments with the ſame firmneſs. The captain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his perſonal reſpect for the character of the general, commending the character of mr. Lund Waſhington, and aſſured him, nothing but his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſconceived the terms of the firſt anſwer, could have induced him for a moment to conceive the idea of taking the ſmalleſt meaſure offenſive to ſo illuſtrious a character as the general, explaining at the ſame time the real or ſuppoſed provocations which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled his ſeverity, on the other ſide of the river. Mr. Waſhington, after ſpending ſome time in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony on board, returned, and inſtantly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched ſheep, hogs, and an abundant ſupply of other articles, <hi>as a preſent to the Engliſh frigate.</hi>

12. The conſtitution of Pennſylvania makes a year's reſidence in the ſtate, and payment of taxes, the ſole requiſites to qualify a man for an elector.</p>
            <p>At an election, when parties were violent, each warmly canvaſſing for ſuffrages, a captain of a ſhip, then lying at the wharf, took his ſeamen to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, paid a tax for each, and procured a certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the payment—then putting ſuch tickets or votes in their hands, as he pleaſed, led them to the ſtate-houſe, where they all lodged their votes.</p>
            <p>On the return of the ſhip the next voyage, juſt before ſhe arrived in Delaware bay, ſhe was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a vaſt multitude of porpoiſes, purſuing a weſterly courſe with the ſhip. "See here," ſays one of the ſailors, to his ſhip-mate, "what a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry company we have." "Yes, d—n 'em," replies Jack, "<hi>they are driving for Philadelphia, I believe, to pay taxes, and vote for aſſemblymen.</hi>" The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who was then walking on the quarter deck, heard the ſarcaſtic wag, and ſmiled, but ſaid not a word.</p>
            <p n="13">13. A very worthy man in a neighbouring ſtate, was remarkable for his abſence of mind. In one of his profound reveries, he ſaddled his horſe to carry a bag of corn to a mill at ſome diſtance, but forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to place the bag and himſelf too upon the horſe, he took the corn upon his own ſhoulders, led the horſe and marched nearly a mile, before he diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his miſtake. At length one of his neighbours met him, and to his great ſurpriſe, aſked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not be eaſier for him to let his horſe carry the bag of corn? The man took the hint, laid the load upon his horſe, and proceeded on his way.</p>

Soon after the ſettlement of Virginia, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Smith, then preſident of the council, conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a party of men a few miles from James-town, to cut timber.—Among the reſt were <hi>two gentlemen,</hi> who had not been uſed to labour. As they were at work, their fingers began to be bliſtered, and the pain of holding their axes was ſuch as to extort an oath at every third blow. To prevent this, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident ordered the oaths each day to be numbered, and at night condemned each man to have a cann of water for each oath poured into his ſleeve. Theſe waſhings had the deſired effect, and it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards rare to hear an oath in a week.</p>

Some years ſince, an Indian reſided in the metropolis of a neighbouring ſtate; he gained his ſubſiſtence by his induſtry, and being a very handy fellow, he was frequently employed by many in the city, particularly by the governor. The Indian, whoſe name was Joſeph, took the liberty of enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the governor, how it came to paſs he had ſo many fine things about him and never worked any? The governor replied that he got them by head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work. Joe wiſhed to be inſtructed in the myſtery, but was informed his ſcull was too thick for it.

Some time after, Joe was ſent for by the governor, who demanded to know what he would have for killing a calf? Joe ſaid, he would do it for two ſhillings: he was deſired to go to the ſtable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the buſineſs; he went, cut the calf's throat, and left him lying there; after ſome delay he went to the houſe, and received his pay: ſoon after the governor went to ſee how his veal looked, but was aſtoniſhed to find the calf lying dead, and nothing more done to it. He ſent for the Indian, repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him ſeverely for treating him ſo. Joe inſiſted that he had complied fully with his agreement; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had killed the calf, and that for two ſhillings more he would dreſs it, aſking the governor, <hi>if that was not ſomething like head-work?</hi>

She aſſured him of the little probability of ſucceſs, and with her uſual warmth declared, that if he did not immediately recall the troops, and make atonement for the blood that had already been ſhed, he ſhould loſe his head. He laughed, and told her, it was of little conſequence, reſpecting himſelf, as long as he preſerved her friendſhip, which at all events he ſhould be careful to do: for you know, mrs.

In the year 1785, a farmer of Bucks' county, aſſiſted by his people, working in harveſt, killed a rattle-ſnake; and ſoon after having occaſion to go home, took up by miſtake his ſon's jacket, and put it on; the ſon was a ſtripling, and both their jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets were made of the ſame kind of cloth. The old man being warm, did not button the jacket until he got to the houſe, then found it much too little for him; he inſtantly conceived the idea, that he had been imperceptibly bitten by the rattle-ſnake, and ſwelled from the effects of the poiſon; he grew ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly very ill, and was put to bed. The people about him were very much alarmed, and ſent for two or three phyſicians; one of whom poured down his throat a pint of melted lard—another gave him a doſe of wild plantain—and the third made him drink hoar hound tea, made very ſtrong. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing all, he grew worſe and was to appearance on the verge of diſſolution, when his ſon came home, with the old gentleman's jacket hanging like a bag about him. The whole myſtery was at once unravelled, and the poor farmer, notwithſtanding his drenches of hogs'-fat, plantain and hoarhound, was well in an inſtant.</p>

this gentleman was thrown into the Baſtile, and confined there ſeveral weeks without the leaſt intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what he was accuſed of; only on his earneſt enquiry, one of the officers told him he was afraid it would go hard with him, and aſked him whether he was a catholic, and would be attended by a prieſt, which he, being a proteſtant, refuſed. After ſome time a battle of wine was brought, and he was aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether he knew what wine it was, and was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to drink it: he complied, and anſwered that he believed it was ſome of his own Madeira. At length he was releaſed, and then he diſcovered that doctor Franklin had been taken ill, ſoon after he received his preſent, and it was imagined that he had been hired by the <hi>Engliſh court to poiſon the doctor.</hi>

               </gap>; who, having repeatedly called on him to return, were at length obliged to fire at him, and wounded him ſo that he could not proceed. Upon examining the papers with which he was charged, they were found ſo accurately and ingeniouſly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that general Lincoln was convinced they were the work of another hand, and offered the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier his life, provided he would diſcover the perſon in the garriſon, who had employed him. This offer was rejected, with an obſervation, that he knew the riſque which accompanied his attempt, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an adequate conſideration. The uſual ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements were therefore made for his execution, and the rope being tied about his neck, the general hoped that ſuch circumſtances might have ſhaken his fortitude, and ſent an aid-de-camp to make another tender of pardon upon the ſame terms. "No!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the reſolute victim, "you have my life in your power, but my honour is my own." The ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Such conduct, however, proves the inconſiſtency of the human character; nor is it eaſy to conceive, how a mind, ſo ſolicitous to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve its dignity in a matter merely perſonal, ſhould have condeſcended to engage in a treachery, deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to public confidence and allegiance.</p>

Perhaps not, replied the hero, upon ſo great a number—Could you drive <hi>fifty?</hi>—No—Could you drive <hi>twenty?</hi>—No—Could you drive <hi>one?</hi>—O yes. by G—d, I could do that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily at any time.—Then, ſir, ſaid the old gentleman, as you are an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and I am an <hi>American,</hi> if you pleaſe, drive <hi>me.</hi> The political braggadocio, drew in his horns, and ſneaked off.</p>

On the party's returning towards town, they ſtopped to refreſh themſelves at a plantation on Gooſe creek; and the ſoldiers began to jeer their priſoner for rebelling againſt the king.

A young clerical buck of diſtinguiſhed birth, had taken one of the boxes at the opera-houſe.

The Abbé, in order to obtain ſatisfaction for the affront that had been put upon him, lodged a complaint againſt the marechal, in the court of the marechals of France, and petitioned that he might be permitted to ſpeak in perſon in ſupport of his charge. The prayer of the petitioner was readily granted.—He began by expreſſing his high ſenſe
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021642_0059_0FB4EAD3F5A7AFF0"/>
of the honour he enjoyed in being permitted to plead before ſo illuſtrious an aſſembly; at the ſame time that he felt uncommon concern that he had been obliged, in vindication of his own honour, to bring a charge againſt a perſon who had the honour of being a member of the court: he rejoiced, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when he reflected, that they were too juſt and too equitable to refuſe him juſtice, even againſt one of their own brethren. He did not think proper at firſt to name the accuſed in his ſpeech, but took an effectual way of mortifying the general, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which of the marechals was <hi>not</hi> the accuſed, and by mentioning the moſt memorable exploits of each. "It is not, (ſaid he) of marechal ſuch-an-one that I complain; it is not of marechal Broglio, who ſo gloriouſly diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the laſt German war; it is not marechal Clermont-Tonnerre, who has rendered his name ſo famous by the moſt maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly retreats; it is not marechal de Contades, ſo renowned for his victories; it is not marechal de Richelieu, who took Minorca: he of whom I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>never took a place in his whole life but my box</hi> at the opera-houſe," and here he named the accuſed. The lords generals by no means expected ſo ſevere a concluſion; they were ſurpriſed, and at the ſame time not diſpleaſed at it: after a ſhort deliberation they reſolved that the Abbé had juſt grounds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; but that the court, thinking he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſufficient ſatisfaction by the turn he had given to his arguments, and the ſevere and witty concluſion of his ſpeech, would not condemn the accuſed to any further puniſhment than he had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſuffered from the ſatirical turn of the accuſed.</p>

The ſon diſcovered himſelf to the father, who embraced him with great tenderneſs: but the recollection of their ſituation ſoon interrupted their joy, and introduced lamentation and deſpair.—At length the young man addreſſed himſelf to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this manner: "The ſlavery you are going into, will be inſupportable to you, and ſoon put an end to your life, the thoughts of which are worſe than death to me. I have been here a great many years, and know the country, the people and their work; if they will accept of me in your room, I will go back into ſlavery, and you ſhall go home again:—I know if I ſhould be able to raiſe friends, I ſhall be redeemed;—if not—God's will be done!"

Lewis XIV. of France, during queen Anne's war, made uſe of a very politic ſtratagem to recruit his army after its being almoſt ruined by the ſiege of Turin, the battle of Ramillies, and the relief of Barcelona. It happened to be a time of prodigious ſcarcity, and therefore his majeſty iſſued out money, and ſent ſhips to Egypt, Syria, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, and other places where corn was cheap, and filled his magazines, and while his generals were ſurpriſed that he iſſued no orders about levies, he only commanded them to take care that his ſoldiers ſhould have plenty of bread, and to publiſh it every where that it was his majeſty's ſtrict orders. Upon this the poor ſtarving peaſants ran every where to the officers, and liſted ſo faſt, that, though they wanted eighty thouſand men, the army was filled up without any expenſe for levies, beſides twenty new regiments by way of augmentation.</p>

In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which, the work went on (agreeably to Oſborne's ideas, who meaſured moſt things by the facility with which they were done) rather ſlowly: accordingly he frequently ſpoke to dr. Johnſon of this circumſtance; and being a man of a coarſe mind, ſometimes by his expreſſions, made him feel the ſituation of dependence. Dr. Johnſon, however, ſeemed to take no notice of him, but went on according to that plan he had preſcribed to himſelf. Oſborne, wiſhing to have the book out to anſwer ſome temporary purpoſe, and perhaps irritated by what he thought an ignorant delay, one day went into the room where dr.

They aſked him how much he wanted, and when they ſhould bring it? his anſwer was, "the more the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the ſooner the better." They brought him three thouſand guineas. The circumſtance came to the late king's ears, who expreſſed to his miniſters the uneaſineſs he felt at lord Stair's difficulties in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-matters. One propoſed that the king ſhould make him a preſent of a ſum of money when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. Another ſaid, lord Stair was ſo high ſpirited, that if he was offered money, he would run back to his own country, and they ſhould loſe their general. A third ſuggeſted, that to ſave his delicacy, the king ſhould give him ſix commiſſions of cornets to diſpoſe of, which, at the time, ſold for a thouſand pounds a-piece. The king liked this idea beſt, and gave the commiſſions blank to lord Stair, ſaying, they were intended to pay for his journey and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page.

The doctor, melted at this ſtory, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her to place her confidence in God, for that under him he would be her protector. He accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly looked out for a coach to put her into; but there was none to be had: his charity however, was too ſtrong to be cooled by ſuch an accident.

Mr. Savage then imagined his taſk over, and expected that ſir Richard would call for the reckoning, and return home: but his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deceived him; for ſir Richard told him that he was without money, and that the pamphlet muſt be ſold, before the dinner could be paid for; and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage was therefore obliged to go and offer their new production for ſale for two guineas, which with ſome difficulty he obtained.

Did he ſo?</hi> ſaid the king (who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that at three o'clock, ſleep had ſubſtituted a ſober man for one that was drunk) <hi>I am very glad that I have got ſo ſenſible and decent a perſon as you are in his ſtead, and I hope he will never come back; for if I ſee him, I ſhall certainly reſent his behaviour.</hi> So the corporal was diſmiſſed without further reprehenſion.</p>
            <p n="265">265. It is recorded, to the honour of the famous duke of Orleans, who was regent of France during the minority of the late king, that when a man was hired to murder him, and he by his ſpies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured intelligence of it, inſtead of endeavouring to defeat the deſign, he gave orders that the man ſhould be admitted to him. Accordingly he was ſuffered to paſs into the duke's bed chamber one morning early, on pretence of buſineſs from the queen. As ſoon as the duke caſt his eyes on him, he ſpoke thus: <q>I know thy buſineſs, friend, thou art ſent to take away my life. What hurt have I done thee? It is now in my power, with a word, to have thee cut to pieces before my face. But I pardon thee, go thy way and ſee my face no more.</q> The gentleman, ſtung with his own guilt, and aſtoniſhed at the excellent nature of this prince, fell on his knees, confeſſed his deſign, and who employed him; but fearing to tarry in France, he immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the kingdom, and entered himſelf into the ſervice of the king of Spain.</p>
            <p n="266">266. Killigrew, was a man of very great humour and frequently diverted king Charles II. by his lively ſpirit of mirth and drollery. He was frequently at court, and had often acceſs to king Charles, when admiſſion was denied to the firſt peers in the realm. Amongſt many other merry ſtories, the following is related of Killigrew. Charles II. who hated buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as much as he loved pleaſure, would often diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the council by withdrawing his royal preſence when they were met, by which their buſineſs was neceſſarily delayed, and many of the council much
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021642_0094_0FB4EB3AD5B046D0"/>
offended at the diſreſpect ſhewn to them. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened one day when the council were met, and had ſat ſome time in expectation of his majeſty, that the duke of Lauderdale, who was a furious ungoverna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, quitted the room in a paſſion, and accident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally met with Killigrew, to whom he expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf irreverently of the king: Killigrew bid his grace be calm, <hi>for he would lay a wager of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, that he would make his majeſty come to council in leſs than half an hour.</hi> Lauderdale being a little heated, and under the influence of ſurpriſe, took him at his word; Killigrew went to the king, and without ceremony told him what had happened; and added, <q>I know your majeſty hates Lauderdale, though the neceſſity of your affairs, obliges you to behave civilly to him; now if you would get rid of a man you hate, come to the council, for Lauderdale is a man ſo boundleſsly avaricious, that rather than pay the hundred pounds loſt in this wager, he will hang himſelf, and never plague you any more.</q> The king was pleaſed with the archneſs of this obſervation, and anſwered, <hi>then Killigrew, I'll poſitively go;</hi> which he did.</p>
            <p n="267">267. The biſhop of Soiſſons in France, who valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf on the politeneſs of his addreſs, and was remarkable for never having uttered a rude expreſſion, was once, by an indiſcretion, guilty of a piece of rudeneſs, ſufficient to make his good breeding be called in queſtion: and which ſhews the precaution that is neceſſary to be uſed in ſpeaking to ſtrangers. This prelate was at court, where obſerving a lady, who was extremely corpulent, talking to the queen, and at the other end of the room a very genteel youth of a very promiſing appearance, both of whom were utter ſtrangers to him, he addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the young gentleman, and with a ſoft inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating air, after ſome compliments, aſked him if he knew who that Fat Sow was, who was in diſcourſe with her majeſty? <hi>Yes, my lord,</hi> replied the youth,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:021642_0095_0FB4EB3CB0DA2A20"/>
with great modeſty; <hi>that Sow is the ambaſſadreſs of Sweden, and mother to the little pig who has the honour to ſpeak to your lordſhip.</hi> At this anſwer the biſhop was ſtruck with confuſion, and humbly begged pardon, adding, that he could not help feeling the greateſt eſteem for a perſon, who had with ſuch mildneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked him for his brutality.</p>
            <p n="268">268. Sir Charles Wager, was ſeized with a fever while he was out upon a cruize; and the ſurgeon without much difficulty prevailed upon him to loſe a little blood, and ſuffer a bliſter to be laid on his back; by-and-by it was thought neceſſary to lay on another bliſter and repeat the bleeding, to which ſir Charles alſo conſented; the ſymptoms then abated, and the ſurgeon told him, that he muſt now ſwallow a few boluſſes and take a draught: <hi>No doctor,</hi> ſays ſir Charles, <hi>you ſhall batter my bulk as long as you will, but, d—n me! you ſhan't board me.</hi>

            <p n="269">269. The emperor Charles V. having one day loſt his way a hunting in a foreſt, and being pretty far diſtant from his company, found himſelf, after wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering about ſome time, near an inn, which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to refreſh himſelf Being ſeated, he ſaw four men, whoſe appearance boded him no good; however, he took no notice, but called for what he wanted. Theſe men at firſt were lying down and pretended to ſleep. But one ſoon roſe up, and approaching the emperor, told him, that he had dreamt he ought to take away his hat, and in ſaying ſo ſnatched it from him. A ſecond then came to him, ſaying he had dreamt that his ſourtout would fit him very well, and took that from him. A third caſt his eye upon his buff jacket, and ſtript him of it. The fourth dreamt likewiſe in his turn, and tells the prince not to take it amiſs, if he gave himſelf the trouble to ſearch him, and ſeeing a gold chain about his neck, to which hung a flagelet, he went to take it from him: ſlay, my friend, ſaid the

"Becauſe," ſaid the emperor, on ſeeing them, "this ſet of people—have dreamt juſt what they pleaſed, I too am diſpoſed to dream in my turn; and having doſed a little, he ſaid to his attendants, I have dreamt that thoſe gentlemen, the dreamers, all four deſerve the gallows; and it is my will that it be fulfilled immediately." They accordingly hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all four directly oppoſite the inn.</p>

The bull (being good game) gave a great deal of ſport, and foiled every dog that attacked him.—At laſt, old Towzer, whoſe owner (a butcher) ſtood cloſe to the prince, fairly pinned the bull—at which the butcher in the joy of his heart, gave his royal highneſs a ſwinging clap on the back, ſaying at the ſame time, <hi>G—d d—n your blood, mr. Prince, if that is not my dog.</hi>
